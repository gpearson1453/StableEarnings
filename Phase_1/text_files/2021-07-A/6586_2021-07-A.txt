Footnotes
ON THE LAM chased through the backstrtch and improved steadily in the three path of the turn, dueled for the lead past the sixteenth pole and was drawing
away later yards. INSPIRING JUSTICE was hustled up while angling in and contested the pace with Epic West, dueled clear of that one midway on the turn,
dug in under steady stretch encouragement, but gave up the lead past the sixteenth pole and relented later yards. BARNSTORM was slow getting into
stride and gave distant early chase, raced near the rail on the turn and finished well to take third mid-stretch. DAN THE MAN CAN chased through the
backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened. EPIC WEST pressured the runner-up and raced close at the rail to the mid point of the turn,
then weakened the final furlong. SHACKLED gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the six path.

Footnotes
IMAGINE VICTORY closed to contention and stalked into the first turn, was urged to the lead past the three eighths pole, drew clear into the far turn and
widened, then steadily handled through the lane. GANDARI was roughed off the heels of K K Can into the first turn and raced boxed in through the turn,
started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and had to settle for second best. NAVY SWORD was forced outward into
the first turn and raced outside entering the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and passed rivals
in an even finish. C V'S CAMPFIRE bore outward into the first turn and settled off the pace from the half mile pole, gave chase nearing the three eighths
then flattened off the rail on the far turn. SUPER MALIBU was forced outward and into Navy Sword entering the first turn, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and had little left. K K CAN took over early and angled to the inside, came under pressure toward the
seven sixteenths pole, was headed past the three eighths and chased at near even terms, but dropped back leaving the quarter pole and weakened at the
rail on the far turn.

MABEL settled off the earlier pace about the three path, rallied from the five sixteenths pole to take the lead leaving the quarter and drew clear midway on
the far turn, was steadily handled through the upper stretch then hand urged the final sixteenth. KIM'S DIAMOND rounded the opening turn in the four path
and raced well back from contention, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, circled rivals in the seven path of the far turn then dug in at the head of
the lane to take second later yards. ELLIE BEAR rounded the first turn in the four path and settled off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the five
sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the four path then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. CHEESE LOUISE angled in to stalk two deep, took
the lead past the half mile pole and inched clear of Anchor's Firstlady toward the three eighths, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole and was
caught past the pole, dropped back midway on the far turn then weakened the final furlong. ALLEGHENY DBL LIME raced in the three path the opening
turn and was well offf the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, improved off the rail on the far turn but flattened
the final eighth. SARAH BELLUM saved early ground then gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths
and showed little further. RUNNING PRAYERS saved early ground and showed little response. BUFF N was through early. ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY took

CANTAKEITANYMORE raced in the three path the opening turn and settled off the pace, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the
far turn about the three path, dug in past the eighth pole and got up late in a well timed rally. HOT N SPICY LOVE rated close inside the first turn then eased
out into the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths and dueled to a short lead mid-stretch, but was
caught in the final strides. AUBURN MILL rated a short lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms from that
point, raced near the rail on the far turn but was caught mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. POOL BOY CHARLIE stalked off the rail then
challenged toward the three eighths pole, dueled mostly at even terms from that point and remained close two deep on the far turn, but dropped back into
the lane and flattened stride. POINT DRIVEN stalked in the three and four paths the first turn, entered the backstretch outside and showed little response.
ROSSIE VAL saved ground the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch.

handled through the stretch. GOT ANY gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path then dueled for second mid-stretch. JACKS SISTER JILL chased
through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn then yielded second mid-stretch. U S FUNDS pressured the pace approaching the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the turn off the rail and weakened inside the eighth pole. FIFTY GRAY SHADES gave chase, raced in the three path of the turn and showed
little more. SINGING HARMONY gave chase toward the inside and faded into the turn. HOLLYWOOD BROWN became a bit anxious in the gate then

COMPLETE SURPRISE closed to contention while angling in and stalked two deep, drew to even terms toward the seven sixteenths pole, dueled from that
point to take the edge approaching the quarter pole, drove clear midway on the far turn and was steadily encouraged to widen the final eighth. ERV'S
WENCH saved early ground then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, angled
three wide into the stretch and dueled for second a sixteenth away. BIRD TRAFFIC rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled off the pace
from the half mile pole, bid nearing the seven sixteenths, raced in the three path of the far turn and was along for third under the wire. PRINCESS COREY
rated a slim early lead inside, was met approaching the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, gave up the nod approaching the quarter, dropped
back at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened the final furlong. EARNED THE SHOT saved ground the opening turn then eased outward into the
backstretch and showed little further response. WEDDING DAY KITTEN raced in the three path the first turn and showed little response from the half mile
pole. UNCAPTURED RUBY rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, though, faded nearing the far turn.
INTO VICTORY raced close toward the inside and was through after three eighths.

Footnotes
LASER LOOP rated close in the three path then bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, continued to factor two deep through the far turn and took the nod
into the stretch, dug in under steady handling and held on well. FIVE CARD DRAW angled in to stalk two deep, gave chase from the half mile pole and
raced near the rail on the far turn, then came between horses to take second mid-stretch. WASJUANNOWPAUL raced well off the pace about the three
path the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, circled rivals seven wide on the far turn, finished well for
third the final yards and was gaining on the runner-up. TIZEZZY saved early ground while racing well back, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, angled to the eight path on the far turn and dug in under steady stretch encouragement to finish well; widest. FLY E DUBAI broke a step slow then
saved ground the opening turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and had range on the leader in the four path of the far turn, but flattened stride inside
the sixteenth pole. ROSAS WAY rated off the pace inside, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, lost ground looking for racing room on the far
turn then lacked room in deep stretch. BIG BOOTS rounded the opening turn about the four path, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, came
through the far turn in the four path then flattened late stretch. SILVER CASTLE closed to the lead at the thirteen sixteenths pole and angled to the inside to
rate the pace, came under pressure past the five sixteenths, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was caught toward the eighth pole then
weakened the final sixteenth. WALL saved ground well off the pace, bid mildly from the three eighths pole then weakened inside the sixteenth.
