PORTER GENT broke sharply and raced to the lead while just off the rail entering the backstretch, controlled the pace in the run down the backside, opened
a clear advantage into the final turn, and was all out to hold off a late charge from SLEW'S DA BOSS to prevail. SLEW'S DA BOSS settled off the early pace
while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, advanced two wide midway down the backside, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and
closed determinedly four wide in the drive to just miss. DAY RAIDER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, moved into contention approaching the
final turn, rallied three wide through the turn, and finished well two out from the rail in the drive to be along for a share. BILLS SMOKN BULLET away well
and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid.
MCMURPHY away alertly and chased the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, continued to force the issue to the final turn,
before weakening.

Footnotes
ZEN BABY away alertly and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace while opening a clear advantage through the
stretch the first time, maintained her advantage through the final turn, and had just enough late to hold off a late surge by TIMELESS SHRUG to prevail.
TIMELESS SHRUG away well, but settled off the pacesetter while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied two wide through the
final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in deep stretch to just miss. TAKE CHARGE GWEN broke inwards in the opening strides to get away a bit
slowly, settled off the early pace while racing three wide through the stretch the first time, rallied two wide through the final turn, and found her best stride
late while finishing from just off the rail. SIMPLY GOLDEN unhurried early while dropping well behind the field, rallied three wide from well behind the pack
entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive. RACINO away well and stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while saving ground along
the inside, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, but was outfinished late. SATURNA settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through
the stretch the first time, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon.
