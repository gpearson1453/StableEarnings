Footnotes
KIDMON settled off the pace, went inside a rival at the half-mile marker, traveled two then three wide on the far turn, rallied inside the leader and drew
alongside with a sixteenth remaining and drove past. WHATSITTOYA sped clear early, set the pace under a hold, padded the lead leaving the backstretch
and far turn, put to right-handed urging in the lane, drifted in while getting weary late and could not fend off the winner. TYPHOON HARRY stalked outside a
rival then off the rail, raced three wide into the far turn, five wide into the stretch and could not rally. NEW SALUTE tracked the pace from inside, came out
on the far turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
ROSES FOR SUZZETT closest in pursuit while racing inside a rival, traveled three then four wide around the turn, bid three deep at the quarter pole, took
control in upper stretch then kicked clear and won going away under right-handed urging. RUN AUNTIE T RUN sped clear quickly, showed the way in the
two path through the turn, challenged with a quarter mile remaining, lost command in upper stretch but stayed on to hold the place. MISS SHADY broke in
and bumped rival at the start, moved inside on the backstretch, angled three wide leaving the turn, bid between rivals at the quarter pole but needed more in
deep stretch. SURELY SPECTACULAR tracked outside a rival, got fanned five wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. MY SWEET MARY broke in and
bumped rival at the start, sat off the pace early on, came five wide into the lane, drifted out mid-stretch and never threatened. SIP SIP HOORAY came away
slow and checked between at the start, saved ground into the lane and passed tired rivals. BABY DIVA was off slow to begin, traveled three then four wide
on the bend and was never a factor. SCAM LIKELY chased two to three wide around the turn and weakened. DASHING DEMI hustled from the gate,
chased along the inside the two wide into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
GINJA stalked five deep to the turn, bid four deep around the bend, struck the front past the quarter pole and drew away. VELVET SLIPPERS forwardly
placed outside the top pair early, continued three deep around the turn, could not keep pace with the leading trio entering the stretch, shifted out mid-stretch
and kept to task through the late stages and got up for the place. FLIPPING FAST dueled along the inside into and around the turn, could not match strides
with the winner in mid-stretch and got edged for second. THE PHARAOH'S GIRL dueled for command outside FLIPPING FAST, clung to a narrow lead at
the quarter pole, was overtaken soon after and weakened in the final furlong. GLORY OF CHROME stumbled a bit leaving the gate, up close four deep
early on, dropped back into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. KOKO'S MOM settled off the pace, saved ground through the turn and
made no impact. MIRA LOMA MADAM lacked early speed, angled in to save ground on the turn and was always outrun.

CLASSIER cleared from inside went two wide around the clubhouse turn, showed the way along the inside to the far turn, met the bid from DEFUNDED in
upper stretch, maintained a short lead through the lane and held gamely to the wire. DEFUNDED tracked outside a rival, crept closer around the far turn, bid
outside CLASSIER in the drive, pressured that rival through the final furlong then dug in late and just missed. INGEST got bumped by BACK RING LUCK at
the start, was forced out by same rival on the first turn then angled inside that runner, coaxed around the far turn turn then out leaving bend, drifted inward in
the stretch and outkicked IT'S MY HOUSE for the show honors. IT'S MY HOUSE stalked off the inside, chased two wide through the final turn, lacked the
needed bid and lost the show. BACK RING LUCK broke out and bumped INGEST at the start, lugged out around the first turn, remained off the rail to the
stretch and failed to respond to urging.

TRUTH SEEKER went two then three wide on the clubhouse turn, traveled outside rivals on the backstretch, closed in four wide into the far turn, grabbed
the lead mid-stretch and kicked clear. FULL OF LUCK (CHI) went four wide around the first turn, five wide around the second, finished well under left then
right-handed urging but had to settle for second best. STAY GOLDEN prompted the pace from outside, lost contact on the backstretch then re-bid into the
far turn, took over near the three-eighths, cleared into the stretch, ceded the lead in mid-stretch and flattened out. SNAZZY DRESSER set the pace under
pressure, cleared rival on the backstretch, pressured again into the second bend, lost command nearing the three-eighths and weakened. LEPRINO angled
in early, advanced around the first turn, moved off the rail on the backstretch, put in a mild bid outside the top pair at the seven-sixteenths but could not
sustain the momentum through the far turn and weakened. FULL DRAW was rank while being forced out at the start, moved closer up the backstretch,
dropped back around the far turn and weakened. ROBBER BARON broke out, took the first turn five wide, went four then five wide around the second turn
and came up empty.

LITTLE MISS ELLIE stalked outside a rival, entered the far turn three wide, got floated out five wide into the drive, bid four deep in upper stretch, ducked in
at the eighth pole, impeding SIMMER DOWN, and stayed on for the show. MAMA SUPERIOR showed good early speed, dueled inside SUMMER DOWN,
drifted off the rail to the three path leaving the second bend and weakened in the late stages. SIMMER DOWN jumped shadows from the light poles twice
on the first turn, went up to duel for the lead from outside, got floated out into the four path leaving the far turn, was impeded by LITTLE MISS ELLIE and
clipped heels at the eighth pole and was not persevered with late. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED LITTLE MISS ELLIE
FROM THIRD TO LAST FOR DUCKING IN AND CAUSING SIMMER DOWN TO CLIP HEELS AT THE EIGHTH POLE.

Footnotes
SMILEFORME tracked widest early on, navigated the turn four wide, closed in while drifting in mid-stretch and drove clear. AWHITESPORTSCOAT bumped
from outside at the start, chased on the inside then off the rail into the stretch, rallied between rivals inside the eighth pole and got outclosed by the winner.
BLACK STORM chased three wide around the turn, lost path when the winner drifted across mid-stretch, gained a clear path and continued willingly to earn
the show. TIZ A SPEED BOMB broke in and bothered rivals at the start, took the early lead then cleared at the half-mile pole, inched away around the turn,
then yielded in the final furlong. EUSTACE came in and bumped rival at the start, chased between rivals then three to four wide around the turn and offered
no response when called upon. BAM BAM AGAIN broke in and bumped both sides in the beginning, raced in a bit tight between rivals entering the turn,
exited the turn three wide and failed to threaten. RAGING WATERS got pinballed and checked at the start, traveled four then five wide on the turn and could
not rally. AFTERNOON HEAT traveled along the inside into the turn, two wide into the stretch and failed to menace. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED TIZ A SPEED BOMB FROM FOURTH TO SEVEN FOR DRIFTING INWARD SHORTLY AFTER THE START AND CAUSING
A CHAIN REACTION BETWEEN EUSTACE, RAGING WATERS, AND BAM BAM AGAIN WHICH COST RAGING WATERS A CHANCE AT A BETTER
PLACING.

Footnotes
COMPLETE CONTROL got bumped leaving the gate, raced four wide into the stretch, rallied and gained command, switch to the wrong lead late and was
able to hold on. ISLAND FLIGHT chased the pace outside a rival, vied three deep into the turn, dueled leaving the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch,
was overtaken by the winner but stayed on gamely to the wire. KATIE'S PARADISE forwardly placed early, bid between rivals at the seven-sixteenths pole,
dueled leaving the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch, fought back from inside and also went gamely to the wire. DUAL REALITY got brushed at the start,
raced off the pace, swung seven wide into the stretch, drifted out further in the lane and was flying late. CIRCLE OF HONOR stalked along the inside, a bit
off the rail into the lane, moved out further in the stretch and gained ground late. LADY BEYONCE went three wide into the turn, came out into the stretch,
drifted out in the lane and failed to threaten. SPEEDY LOU C got knocked into rival at the start, raced in the two path through the turn and lacked the
needed late kick. CLOSE TO NOWHERE hit the outside portion of the gain and came away slow, traveled four then five wide on the turn and could not rally.
FOREVER FREE broke in and bumped rival then steadied between at the start, entered the turn four wide, exited six wide and failed to menace. SASSY
CHASEY showed speed from inside, vied along the rail with a pair of rivals into the turn, could not keep past leaving the bend and gave way.

Footnotes
GOTTA BE LUCKY stalked the pacesetter through the first turn and into the backstretch, went up to take control at the nine-sixteenths, held a short lead
through the far turn, cleared at the quarter pole and drew off. MONGOLIAN WINDOW raced in range while outside a rival, swung five wide into the stretch
and bested the rest. REDS SACRED APPEAL navigated the first turn four wide, unhurried off the pace, went three wide into the far turn, angled six wide
leaving the bend and was along for the show. KIRSCH TRUFFLE went four to five wide around the first turn, bid outside the top pair, pressured the winner
to the stretch and faltered. SECRET SQUARE threw head and came away a bit slow to begin, traveled in the two path on the first turn then moved inside,
cut the corner into the drive and flattened. CHARLIE'S A. T. M. cleared quickly establishing control, pressured up the backstretch and ceded the lead at the
nine-sixteenths, chased along the inside through the far turn, drifted out in the lane and faded. YOU WANNA EAR RIP trailed the field through the early
stages, steered out on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted back to the inside and failed to menace. BIG ENOUGH traveled along the inside,
came off the rail into the stretch and had little left.
