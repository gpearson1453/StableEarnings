I SEE THE STARS tracked close up on the inside, chased on the far turn, rallied between rivals in upper stretch, dug in determinedly and wore down
ASSUALT WEAPON after a long drive. ASSAULT WEAPON set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the stretch, dug in gamely inside
rivals through the lane and yielded grudgingly in deep stretch. THREENINETYTWO was bumped at the start, stalked close up two wide, chased on the far
turn, rallied outside rivals in upper stretch and finished evenly without a winning bid. MR. MAZZA bobbled at the break, raced four wide early, stalked three
wide, chased three wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. BEDAZZLING checked in tight in the early stages, then raced off the pace and did not factor.
VICTORY TOUR steadied in tight early on, raced off the pace, came wide into the lane and tired. PHIL THE BANKER was bumped at the start, raced off the
pace, gave way and was eased in deep stretch.
