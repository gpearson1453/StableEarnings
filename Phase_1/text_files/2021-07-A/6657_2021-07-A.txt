Footnotes
ROUSING RUBBLE raced close to the pace, rallied on the turn to challenge three across, dueled past the sixteenth pole and inched clear. ROUGE
SUNSET was sent to the front to set the pace, responded when challenged to duel past the sixteenth pole and yielded grudgingly. EL PATRON JET
pressed the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, fell back and finished evenly. DEPUTY KNIGHT was slow early, went widest in the drive and improved
position. DON'T ASK veered in at the start, showed good early speed while racing inside, fell back on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and had no
further response. KING OF MELODY trailed the field. Hand timed.

KONA COAST set a pressured pace, drew clear on the turn and held well in a driving finish. CATS TOUCH stalked the pace while racing inside, angled out
on the turn, bid five wide to loom a threat, couldn't get by the winner and finished second best. INCREDIBLE LUCK advanced to the second turn, bid off the
rail, hung late and settled for show. BRICKBAT was unhurried early, saved ground, bid inside, shifted out for the drive and closed well. BOB'S ALL IN was
outrun in an even effort. GABO'S MACONDO pressed the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. COLONEL GOTHAM had brief speed only. Hand
timed.

along to press the pace, fell back on the turn, continued willingly to the wire and narrowed the gap. SON OF ELEANOR pressed the pace while racing
inside, fell back on the turn, finished evenly and held safely for show. I BUY GOLD improved position in a steady effort. I B EZ bumped at the start, showed
speed to the turn and stopped. VIDAKS BACK bumped at the start, showed speed to the turn and stopped. KING LEBRON was not a factor. DIMERA was
outrun. DELICIOUS trailed the field. Hand timed.
