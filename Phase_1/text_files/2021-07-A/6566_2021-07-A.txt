LOVINISEASY was steadied when blocked behind horses from the half-mile pole until the five-sixteenths pole, edged out three wide nearing the stretch
then readily ran clear once clear. CRYPT was unhurried early while racing outside the winner, edged out four wide nearing the stretch then couldn't stay
with that one through the lane. ROLL ON DUDE raced in the three path while stalking the early leader, moved to a short lead before a half then weakened.
FISHMAN stayed along the rail while with the pace into the turn then tired. ROYAL KAZ opened a short lead soon after the break, stayed out from the inside
while making the way for about a half then tired.

pace two wide into the stretch then faded from between the top two in midstretch. GOHARA steadied in tight nearing the end of the backstretch and faded.

A T M AWESOME was never far back inside, rallied the turn, reached the front in early stretch and drew out after five furlongs. SIX CIDER angled sharply to
the inside while unhurried early on the backstretch, rallied the rail around the turn, swung out entering the stretch then couldn't gain. PENNSYLVANIA
STEEL raced outside with the early pace, moved three wide to a short lead midway on the turn, bore out under left hand whip in early stretch, was sharply
straightened then faded. OBROTHER ITSYLVIA raced two wide between horses around the turn then tired in the lane. FIFTY FLAGS stayed well out from
the rail while making the early pace inside horses and was finished after a half. ATLANTIC CHILL was wide around the turn and stopped. MACHO SMOKE
wasn't far back between horses early, raced three wide around the turn, stopped and was eased up.

GREAT BEND settled while racing well out from the inside, rallied wide between horses into the stretch, was bumped while dueling in midstretch and was
narrowly best. STADIUM settled, rallied wide outside the winner into the stretch, dueled with that one through the final sixteenth but was outfinished.
MIDNIGHT WHISKEY pressed the early leader from along the rail, ran clear midway on the final turn, widened into stretch then drifted into the winner while
weakening. POLITICAL was slow early then made a late run inside. RANDOM THOUGHTS was slow early, raced two wide around the final turn and gained
too late. GEMS MINESHAFT RVF lagged to the stretch and found best stride too late. QUICKER made the pace two wide into the far turn then stopped in
the lane.
