Footnotes
BOURN WILD AGAIN raced three wide off the pace, moved up four wide on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch run, closed willingly and was along late
to win going away. PASATIME raced three wide on the first turn, pressed the pace racing close up outside of PALIO SIENA, bid two wide on the far turn, led
into the stretch, edged away, dug in gamely but was no match for the winner. BELLA SERENA raced three wide on the first turn, then stalked two wide,
advanced on the far turn, rallied mildly three wide into the stretch and bested the others. COLONEL BAILEY raced three wide early, settled off the pace,
between rivals, saved ground on the far turn and closed mildly between rivals in the stretch. PERSONAL SERVER steadied at the start, raced off the pace
inside and did not factor. LADY CARMELA broke in the air, raced four wide early, three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, came three wide into the
stretch and had no rally. SQUARE PEG tracked the pace on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and had no rally. PALIO SIENA cleared the field soon
after the start, set the pace on the inside, was pressured on the backside, dueled on the turn and faded. BROOKSLEY raced off the pace inside, then

HEY PADRE raced off the pace with a ground saving trip throughout, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied outside, closed willingly in deep stretch and
was up in time. B DETERMINED raced off the pace while saving ground throughout, rallied on the rail in the stretch drive, finished well late but just missed.
RIDE EM rated the pace on the inside, shook free on the far turn, showed the way into the stretch, responded when roused nearing the furlong marker, then
drifted out bothering a rival and was outkicked. TAKE PROFIT raced two wide off the pace, between rivals at the quarter pole, moved to the rail and lacked
a winning bid. LAW OF THE LAND broke outward, raced three wide early, stalked outside a rival, moved up three wide on the far turn, bid in upper stretch,

Footnotes
EXPENSIVE STYLE tracked on the inside, chased inside on the turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, dueled with BIG TALL DAWG in the final furlong
and prevailed late after a long drive. BIG TALL DAWG set the pace racing with a clear lead, raced well off the inside turning for home, responded when
asked, dug in gamely through the stretch and yielded grudgingly late. LEME AT EM raced three wide off the pace, three wide on the turn, rallied four wide
into the lane, dug in and earned the show spot. ROYAL THUNDER steadied at the start, raced two wide off the pace, moved up four wide at the quarter pole
and rallied mildly outside. TITHED stalked two wide, chased between rivals on the turn and weakened. CODE NAME BRODY raced off the pace inside and
did not factor.
