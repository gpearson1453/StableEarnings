WHY WHY PAUL WHY well placed behind the dueling leaders, took over midway on the final turn then pulled away under moderate urging. GRANDFIRE
vied inside for three furlongs, was collared again by the winner, continued well but was no match. GO HUSKIES dueled outside for three furlongs and
weakened. THE METHOD dropped back inside, gained late just missing the show. MINE NOT MINE broke sluggishly, raced just off the inside and was no
factor.

LUXURY SUITE lacked speed, advanced very wide into the stretch and was up in the final yards following a long drive. MY MAN ELVIS engaged in a taxing
duel outside and battled gamely to the finish. RINGS OF JUPITER vied along the inside with a narrow lead and continued determinedly while outfinished.
SURFER BOY GEORGE saved ground well behind the dueling leaders, bid closer on the final turn then tired. FINGLAS chased off the inside and lacked a
rally. NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

three wide and tired. SCREEN SAVER dropped well behind inside and lacked a rally. HOLLYWOOD JET eased back then bid closer four wide on the turn
then flattened out in the stretch. MR. ROUNDTREE lagged far behind in the two path and was never a factor.

BOOM BOOM GIRL took over outside at the three eighths pole and rapidly drew away under mild pressure. SKY QUEEN steadied entering the backstretch,
chased inside, continued well but was no match for the winner. IRISH JUMPER steadied entering the backstretch, pursued along the rail and was no threat.
CAPE ELIZABETH ducked out at the break, dropped back outside and lacked a bid. LIAM'S LADY raced wide off the leaders and faded on the final turn.
CREATIVE JOY was soundly struck by stricken opponent after leading for quarter mile causing her to bobble badly and having rider lose his irons briefly. LA
PANZANELLA inherited the lead after a quarter mile then stopped abruptly. VICTORIA BELLE suffered a catastrophic injury to her left front leg after a
quarter mile, was eased and subsequently euthanized, The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident on the backstretch.

INSPIRED OPTIONS stalked the dueling pacesetters, took over midway on the final turn and eagerly drew away while kept to his task. LONGTAIL vied
outside, had no response to the winner but gamely held for the place. NO FLY ZONE dueled along the inside and continued well but could not get by the
runner-up. YONDERING dropped back early, chased near the inside and was no factor. EPIGRAMMATIST lacked speed, moved very wide throughout and
was outrun. MR. SHADES OF GRAY eased back after the start, bid inside on the first turn then stopped abruptly.
