Footnotes
LUTES LIL GIFT sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, increased her advantage into the stretch and won with little need of urging.
CRIBBS chased the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. LONSDALEITE was reserved just off the
leaders from the inside throughout and failed to gain in the drive. SKY'S THE LIMIT lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. UNCOMMONBLESSING was off a step slow, lagged early, saved ground and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
DEEPINGREEN sprinted clear soon after the start, was well rated through the back-stretch, increased his margin into the lane and held sway to the wire.
PARTY FOR ONE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished well to hold
the place. KID ARCADE lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and finished with a steady rally. IRISH
TERRIER was forwardly placed from the inside throughout and lacked the needed closing response. BRAHMS FOREST was hustled along to chase the
winner while racing three-wide and weakened in the drive. ROCKET POWER was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was
not a factor.

REELFOOT raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and was up in the closing yards. THE PRESS was reserved
just off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter and finished with good late energy. FLOAT ON was away in good order to set a pressured
pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. MIXO broke sharply to press the pace of FLOAT ON while racing three-wide and gave way in
the drive. SILVER FURY lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
I WANT ONE was away in good order to open a clear lead before going a quarter, raced three-wide while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. GOLD
SUPPLY was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with a steady bid. SHE'S AN EAGLE raced off the
pacesetters early, altered course from pulling up horse nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with good courage
to gain the show. RAIDERETTE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened in the drive. SADIE SUE was off slow, raced unhurried early, and
was not a factor. VERAAJ was off slow then allowed to settle, raced four-wide through the turn and was eased through the lane. TOMORROW'S MINE went
wrong and was pulling up nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, fell, unseated her rider and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BLAZINGBELLABLU settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, responded to steady urging and wore down ZIPPIN SEVENZ in the
closing yards to be going away late. ZIPPIN SEVENZ was bumped at the break, pressed the pace of FOR YOU ONLY while racing three-wide, moved up to
take command nearing the three-eighths pole, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run but could not hold the winner safe late. YOU GO GIRL was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached a striking position but finished evenly late. FOR YOU ONLY was bumped at
the start, set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way after going three-eighths. THAT'S MY STORY lacked early speed, saved ground through the
turn and did not reach contention. TOTHEMOONANDBACK broke alertly to press the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.
APRILINTHEPINES lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
TODOS SANTOS was bumped at the break, tracked the leader from the inside, angled out nearing the five-sixteenths pole, reached the fore with a quarter
to run and was ridden out to be kept to task. RAELEE was bumped at the start, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn,
could not gain on the winner in the drive but was clearly second best. NOUMEA was bumped at the break, showed no early speed, raced three-wide
through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with some late run. SASSY EDIE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way
through the final furlong. ROSIES BABY was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, steadied nearing the quarter and did not menace. CONSTANT
CRAVING was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. LOVE SOLUTION sprinted clear at once and weakened
after going six furlongs.
