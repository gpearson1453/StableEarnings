DESK POP established a ground saving stance from outset, gained command early, and drew off in homestretch for a gate to wire victory. GENTLE
ROCKET showed reserve by tucking to the inside behind the pacesetting trio, hugged the rail through the turn and responded strongly to urging in final
furlong by rallying up the rail to earn the place. RUMBLING THUNDER disputed the pace from between rivals along the backstretch, was two wide around
the bend, led the second flight at upper stretch, and held the show in the end while failing to fend off the late rally of GENTLE ROCKET. RUN ETHAN RUN
weakened in the late going after forcing the issue early from a three wide stance. DEPUTY REAGAN failed to menace while rating in the second flight as the
outer rival of two abreast.

Footnotes
D R C'S ARM CANDY came away alertly, gained first command and led at every call while saving ground. MS. WILD ARGUMENT was unhurried early and
trailed the field along the backstretch before fanning four wide at upper stretch and rallying furiously to earn the place. PASSION GAL lacked a needed rally
to improve placing after stalking the pace from outset into upper stretch from a two path stance. CHEROKEE ROSE settled into second flight as the outer
rival of two abreast, angled out to three wide through the final bend and lacked a response in the final furlong. ONE RING awaited options in the opening
half by saving ground behind the pacesetting duo, maintained that line into the homestretch but was unable to advance on the leaders in closing strides.

Footnotes
MARS CURIOSITY hustled from outset to set the pace in tandem with CATALE STORM while trekking the two path through the turn, gained the slightest of
advantage at upper stretch and locked into a lengthy duel with that rival in final furlong before getting the nod at the wire. CATALE STORM rushed from
outset and established a ground saving stance while setting the pace in unison with MARS CURIOSITY then dueled the length of the homestretch with that
rival but was outnodded in the end. CELTA VIGO pressed the pace along the backstretch, swung to three wide around the turn, but was unable to match the
top pair in final furlong. L. A. FREEWAY trailed the field along the backstretch and passed a tiring rival in the late going. STARWARD failed to menace by
traveling the widest of all and tiring in the closing strides.

RUNAROUND ROSEY hustled to gain first command, trekked the two path around the opening bend, refused to be headed along the backstretch, saved
ground through the closing turn and inched away in final furlong for a gate to wire score to make it three wins in a row. TAPINDEED pressed the pace from
an inside stance, dropped back to second flight nearing the conclusion of backstretch and proved to be no match for the winner in closing stages.
SALACIOUSACUSATION rallied mildly to improve placing after trailing the field through the opening half. ROYAL SOPRANO trekked the two path and
chased the pacesetters through the opening half, then angled out at upper stretch but to no avail.

CAPTAIN COMEBACK was unhurried through the opening half and trailed the field near the three eighths pole, was roused along the backstretch and
circled all rivals near the five sixteenths pole, gained command at the conclusion of the backstretch and outdueled. FROGGY in the final furlong for the
score. FROGGY showed reserve in the opening quarter, rated along the inside at the half pole with a slight advantage on the field, was headed near the
quarter pole by CAPTAIN COMEBAK and locked into a lengthy duel with that rival but proved second best in the end. BOLD IMAGE lacked a rally to
improve placing after settling into mid pack and travelling wide near the half pole. SMOOTH OPERATOR pressed the early pace and rated close up through
the opening half from between rivals before fading and passing a tiring rival in the crucial stages. HEARTASTORMIN flashed early foot and led the field at
first call from in inside stance before tiring in the closing strides.

TIME TO FIGHT assumed command at first stride and refused to relish command for a gate to wire score. INTERNET EXPRESS broke alertly and was just
off the pace from a three path stance at the conclusion of backstretch, rated three wide and led the second flight at upper stretch, but was no match for the
tough winner in final furlong. DALMAVSMAN finished with a rush and strong closing strides after being unhurried from outset and saving ground through the
turn. PICTURE ME CLASSY came up empty and failed to sustain the bid after pressing the pace from between rivals. DRAMACIDE trailed the field along
the backstretch and improved placing with late interest. CROSSBOW CIMARRON showed reserve early, was roused inside the quarter pole, travelled wide
at upper stretch, and lacked a late bid. QAUNICO rated mid pack through the bend and tired in the final furlong.

SHERRY BABE assumed command at first stride, established an inside position and led every call for a repeat performance. EURO STEP settled into the
second flight and rated between rivals for the opening half, was roused inside the quarter pole, split rivals at upper stretch and rallied in the final furlong to
earn the place. AMERICA'S DARLING established a ground saving stance shortly after the start by tucking behind the early pacesetters, then secured the
show by finishing willingly. ACERTIVE MISS was unhurried in the opening half and trailed the field at the conclusion of backstretch before swingin widest of
all at upper stretch and improving position with late interest. ZAPIT faded in the crucial stages after pressing the early pace two wide and rating three wide at
upper stretch. FATEFULLY YOURS trekked the three path and settled into second flight before tiring in the late going.

Footnotes
BLACK MAGIC LADY broke alertly and pressed the pace as the widest of all rivals into and through the opening bend, gained command along eh
backstretch, and kicked clear in the closing quarter for the score. ROSIE FLASHBACK trekked the three path around the first turn while rating in the second
flight, made a mid move along the backstretch to lead the second flight at the conclusion of the backstretch, but was no match for the winner in final furlong
while finishing a clear second. IMA CRUEL GIRL hustled from outset to set the early pace in tandem with WOW WOW ITS MAGIC, was the inner most rival
through the first bend, then gave way to top pair inside the quarter pole and saved the show. HARPERS VISION lacked a late bid after pressing the pace
from a two path stance through the opening half. WOW WOW ITS MAGIC flashed early foot and set the pace in unison while three wide before fading in the
crucial stages. CANDY HEARTS trailed the field from outset through the first two calls and failed to threaten while passing a tiring rival in closing strides.
FIDDLERSHOTPLEASUR saved ground, rated back, and tired in the late going.

Footnotes
BIG BASE settled into mid pack and saved ground in the early stages, angled out along the backstretch and advanced position, gained command at upper
stretch and secured the victory with a driving finish. JUSTABOUTRIGHT hustled from outset and led the field through three quarters, was headed by rallying
rival at upper stretch, then failed to fend off that rival in final furlong. BILLIE G was unhurried in the early strides, saved ground through the second turn,
advanced position along the backstretch while under urging, and finished willingly to earn the show. HOT SPRINGS BLING showed reserve from outset and
settled in between rivals near the back of pack at the half pole before weaving rivals along the backstretch, fanning wide at upper stretch and rallying mildly
to improve placing in the late going. NORTHERN DYNASTY stalked the early pacesetter from an inside stance through the opening half before weakening
in the crucial portion of contest. RIVER LIBERTY gave chase to pacesetter as the widest of all rivals and lost ground on front runners by doing so.
DIXIELAND CANDY broke alertly and was close up at first call, rated between rivals near the half pole in the second flight and faded in the late going.
OREO GIRL pressed the early pace as the outermost rival of three abreast near the half pole before being eased in the homestretch.

nearing the quarter pole, and came again in final eighth to secure the score. MUNI MUNI SLEW stalked the early pace from a three path stance, gained
command near the quarter pole, led at deep stretch and was nipped in final stride. IMALITTLESILVER showed reserve in the early going before rallying
strongly along the rail to secure the show. KAY'S GRAY pressed the pace while trekking three wide through the opening bend, gained command between
calls, but gave way to top trio in closing stages. WEST COAST BROKER rushed from outset to force the early pace issue while rating between rivals around
the first bend then lost ground to front runners along the backstretch and failed to muster a late rally. WOODS OF CONGAREE settled behind the early
pacesetters and traveled the two path through the opening half and improved placing with late interest. CROSSING DIXIE tucked to save ground in the early
going, was in the pocket along the backstretch and steadily faded in the closing strides. MALIBU MO gave chase from a wide stance and tired in the end.
