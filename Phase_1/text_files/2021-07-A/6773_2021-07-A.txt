AMERICA'S JUSTICE set the pace in hand while pressed early, took charge after a half mile and then widened while never asking to win easily. NIGHT
ESCORT close up in hand, tracked inside on the last turn, eased out some in the lane and finished clearly best of the rest. STARSHIP GOTHAM in hand
along the three path, took the two path on the last turn and then was no match for the top pair. MISERY MASTER saved ground after a half mile to the wire
and tired. IMMERSION forced the issue briefly, tracked after a half mile, took the three path into the last turn and was done after that. DUNHAM BAY broke
slow, four wide into the backstretch and trailed throughout.
