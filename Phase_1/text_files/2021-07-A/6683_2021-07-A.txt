Footnotes
RINCE TAPAIGH broke outward then stalked the pace, closed three-wide on the turn, led a furlong out, widened and finished under a hand ride. SUBZERO
PLUS forced the pace from the rail, bid at the top of the stretch, was no match for the winner and held place. CANADIAN MAGIC set a pressured pace, was
engaged at the top of the stretch, gave way grudgingly and chased to the end. ROSE RING, steadied at the start, raced in mid pack, closed four-wide on the
turn then finished evenly. MODUS OPERANDI hit the gate leaving and settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn and was all
out in the stretch. BLONDILIKESTODANCE raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then finished gamely in vain. TOY SHOW lost
her path at the outset, settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn but failed to menace. JACK'S MEMORY raced from off the pace, chased
two and three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. GLIB MARYLIN settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn but was never in
contention.

Footnotes
ZOYSIA raced in mid pack, chased two to four-wide through the turn, rallied outside and was just in time, driving. SADIE IRENE stalked the pace, was
hustled from the rail on the turn, gained command mid stretch but was caught on the wire. SOMEONE ELSE broke outward, raced in mid pack, was hustled
angling in from the third path to two-wide on the turn then was all out in the stretch and gained steadily. HOLD THE APPLAUSE was rated off the pace, was
hustled three to five-wide on the turn then finished gamely. SEA LILY got away off slowly, moved up to lead on the main track, set the pace, was passed in
the final furlong and gave way. MERINO WOOL settled off the pace, was hustled through the turn then finished willingly from the outside. SHOW SOME
SKIN raced in mid pack, saved ground on the turn then finished evenly. J M R BOLD VISION stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn
then flattened out in the stretch. WORDS OF GOLD pressed the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn then tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
LENNY K was widest tracking in mid pack down the backstretch, moved up willingly while circling the field five to four wide on the turn, engaged the leader
turning for home and had the front at the head of the lane, opening a clear margin before widening in the final seventy yards. SPITE STORE cleared quickly
out of the gate, maintained an open length lead until collared by the winner at the top of the lane, gave way grudgingly down the stretch but held second
easily. BLUE MAX in midpack while outside two rivals chasing the pacesetter early, followed the top two finishers into the stretch but was no match for that
pair, all out to hold the show late over closing rivals. MAGIC SPIN settled in between rivals chasing the leader early, followed the eventual third place
finisher into the stretch and was inching up on that rival late but could not get by, settling for a minor award. BEYOND MY DREAMS trailed the field down
the backside, rallied four to five wide on the turn and was in the five or six path down the lane, continuing to gain ground to the finish. EXECUTIVE GIANT
was three wide and off the pace in the backstretch, five to four wide on the turn but a mild rally was all he could muster, never reaching contention. SEND
THE WORD missed the break and spotted the field five lengths, rushed up into the back of the chasing pack by the half mile pole, stayed on until flattening
out down the stretch. STAR SCHOLAR chased the leader inside two rivals into the turn, gradually fading out of it from that point to the wire.

Footnotes
TRANQUILITY BASE showed early speed but was engaged in a duel, battled through the turn, began to edge ahead near mid stretch then held DOWNY
BOY safe under a drive. DOWNY BOY stalked the pace, closed three-wide late turn, responded in the stretch and gained steadily, but missed. BACHELOR
PAD hit the gate, pulled hard to get up and duel, battled from the rail on the turn but gave way grudgingly a 16th out. ROBUSTO settled at the back of the
pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide through the turn then finished gamely. DOUBLE THE HEART stalked the pace from the rail, was
behind horses on the turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a closing response. BON PRIX broke outward and settled at the rear of the pack, came two to
four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch then finished evenly.

Footnotes
HARD STREET emerged from the tightly knit pack to take a short lead, shook clear into the turn, set a reserved pace, was set down upper stretch and held
sway under a drive. SECRETS TOLD forced the pace, chased from the rail on the turn then was all out for second. FEDALIA stalked the pace, was hustled
along the rail through the turn and was gaining in the late stages. CARPE HORSESHOE stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then
finished gamely to no avail. FEW REGRETS broke inward and bobbled leaving her at the rear of the pack, was hustled along but was never a threat.

Footnotes
THATSMYKINDANIGHT pressed the early leader then took a short lead, shook clear into the turn, set the pace, widened upper stretch and held sway under
steady handling. KERICS BEAUTY broke outward and settled in mid pack, closed angling from the rail to three-wide through the turn, then rallied gamely
from outside. JOLENE JOLENE hopped leaving the gate and settled in mid pack, closed two and three-wide on the turn then rallied gamely. ORBALINE
stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide and from the rail on the turn then finished evenly. SHANGHAI BOUND settled in mid pack, closed angling from the
rail to three-wide through the turn then finished with good energy. I'M NOT PERFECT was herded outward leaving the gate, raced in mid pack, was hustled
four to six-wide on the turn then lacked a closing response. RUM RAISIN broke outward and bumped REGAL BILLEE, showed speed then stalked the pace,
chased into the stretch but flattened out. REGAL BILLEE, bumped at the start, was in striking range, came three to five-wide through the turn, was roused in
the stretch but lacked a response. THE TWELFTH hopped leaving the gate but had speed, dueled into the turn, was quickly headed, then, while still close
along the rail she was pinched back near mid turn and lacked a closing response. SLASHS RED DIAMOND got away slowly and settled well off the pace,
then never reached contention. BELLA LALOU was in striking range early turn and just behind the stalkers when VIRACOCHA came back between horses
after clipping heels. BELLA LALOU and VIRACOCHA appeared to have contact and BELLA LALOU was checked long and hard then was pulled up and
walked off the track without finishing. VIRACOCHA was close early, forced the pace, came back a bit at the turn, clipped heels between rivals and when the
two horses made contact she lost her rider then walked off. AFTER REVIEWING THE INCIDENTS ON THE TURN THE STEWARDS LEFT THE RESULTS
AS POSTED.
