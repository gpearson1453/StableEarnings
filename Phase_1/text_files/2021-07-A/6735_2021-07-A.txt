Footnotes
INCLUDEANATTITUDE angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, conceded some ground to that foe racing into the far
turn, saved ground to upper stretch steadily regaining striking distance, bid for command inside the leader midstretch, wrested the advantage and kicked
away late under firm encouragement. DANZIG STAR shifted to the two path while being urged to the lead racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a
narrow advantage to the backstretch, forged clear racing into the far turn, drifted out nearing upper stretch while appearing to lose some momentum and
failed to sustain her bid when headed by the winner. HAVEN'S JOY, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch,
weakened racing through the far turn while continuing well enough to earn a share. DANIELLE'S DEAL tracked off the second flight along the inside to the
backstretch but offered no rally. OUR JEANO bobbled at the start, was settled along the inside in early stages and never gained contention. CARRILLO
STREET settled outside foes racing to the first turn and trailed the field thereafter.

Footnotes
GIPSEY SORCERESS tracked off the first flight near the inside in early stages, shifted to the four path advancing to contention outside foes nearing the
stretch and produced a sustained response to wear down the leader in time under firm encouragement. SWEET TATUM broke sharply, was rated just off
the first flight racing to the turn, switched out to lodge a bid with a quarter mile to go, went clear in upper stretch but just failed to contain the winner at the
wire. CHEVERIE, off last, shifted off the inside racing into the turn and improved position between foes late. SWEET AS CANBE, off a step behind the
leaders, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace racing into the turn, inherited the lead leaving the midway point of the turn but came up empty in the
drive. MY LITTLE RIVER, urged between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch, was shuffled a bit avoiding tight quarters entering the bend and
had no closing bid. YOU GOT THIS forced the pace three wide through the backstretch, was pulled up abruptly nearing upper stretch, then was vanned off
course.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S TEETH angled inwards to prompt the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, edged forward leaving midstretch and maintained a narrow
advantage under brisk handling. TABIA broke readily, angled to the inside disputing the pace inside a rival into the turn, resisted that foe to late stages but
proved only second best. BURGAMEISTER tracked the leaders four wide in second flight, shifted in while being urged to advance three deep on the bend
and continued evenly in that path to late stages. HERBIE tracked off the first flight along the inside to the turn and faded into upper stretch. LITTLE NO WAY
tracked off the second flight in early stages, shifted out four wide on the turn but had no rally. DROP THE GLOVES tracked the leaders between foes in
second flight but faded early. FIVE STAR CREEK stumbled at the start, switched outside rivals in the second flight early but steadily retreated nearing the
lane.

Footnotes
ICYWILBURNYEH showed good early speed out of the gate then was caught four wide through the opening bend, tracked in the first flight three wide down
the backstretch then commenced a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole and finished well under mild left-handed pressure through the lane. GOLDEN
GOPHER broke well from the gate, dictated the pace on the inside through the opening half, led the field into the far turn then was collared nearing the three
sixteenths pole, and finished willingly to hold off oncoming foes for second place. WITHHERBOOTSON saved ground through the first turn, continued to
track leaders down the backstretch while confidently handled on the rail, angled towards the rail off of the far turn and failed to make up ground on the
leaders but did pass a tiring MOONSHINE MOXY to gain third place in the final sixteenth. MOONSHINE MOXY was forwardly placed on the outside through
the opening half, prompted between foes through the far turn then battled briefly to the three sixteenths but flattened out in the final furlong and settled for a
minor share. CANTERBURY GOLD reared during loading process, off slow, settled outside early, shifted out nearing the three sixteenths but failed to
respond and finished evenly in the lane. ANNIE'S SHENANIGAN was off slowly out of the gate, settled well back early and failed to commence a bid to get
within striking distance. NOTE PAD was allowed to settle back, shifted out past the quarter pole to move within striking distance, attempted to split foes at
the three sixteenths but lacked momentum and failed to menace in the stretch. PILOTS STAR was far back throughout and proved no factor.

Footnotes
SPUN LINE broke well from the gate then conceded the lead to GEMSTONE GAL, tracked the pacesetter through the opening bend then took command
past the half mile pole, repelled the challenge of BERRY GOOD at the quarter pole and drew off in the lane under strong left and right handed pressure to
the wire. BERRY GOOD was caught five wide on the first turn then settled back on the outside down the backstretch, commenced a three wide bid nearing
the three eighths pole but failed to match strides with SPUN but finished well to hold on for second. SHIP'S CREEK was rank shortly after the start falling
back to the rear of the field into the opening bend, continued well off the pace throughout, shifted out four wide at the top of the stretch and rallied belatedly
down the center of the lane to gain show. LILA'S LUCKY LADY was four wide throughout and passed tiring foes. GEMSTONE GAL was hustled to the lead
on the inside, led the field to the half mile pole then relinquished command and weakened to the wire. SOMEONE SAID SO was three wide early, bid
between foes on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. DO YOU BILEVE saved ground throughout then tired after the half.

Footnotes
SHINNY tracked the early pace of PAPPA RIZZO on the inside, continued to save ground through the far turn, waited patiently for room at the top of the
lane, split foes nearing the furlong marker and kicked clear under steady urging. WHERE'S JORDAN was reserved on the inside through the early stages,
continued to save ground into the far turn then angled five wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and closed well down the center of the track to get up for
place. JUST BLAZE was well back on the inside during the opening half, shifted four wide nearing the quarter pole, took a brief lead nearing the eighth pole
and was outkicked in the stretch. CREATIVE PLAN was allowed to settle well back on the inside, shifted out four wide on the far turn and gained mildly
through the lane to earn a minor share. I'M AN EIGHT was allowed to settle back on the rail in the second flight, moved out to commence a three wide bid
nearing the half mile pole but failed to sustain that rally and had no late response. UNLEASH THE BEAST broke well from the gate, tracked the early pace
on the outside, advanced between foes when prompted nearing the half mile pole, failed to sustain bid at the top of the lane and gave way late. PAPA
RIZZO was hustled to the lead out of the gate under strong hand urging, continued to the lead to the top of the stretch but faded in the lane. ***Following the
race, the stewards conducted an inquiry after the rider of number five I'm an eight claimed foul against the rider of number six just blaze. After review, there
was no change to the order of finish.***

BELLA FIGURA (IRE) tracked early pace on the inside, shifted three wide at the three sixteenths pole and wore down foe to edge by in the final yards. A
ROZE AND WINE was hustled to the lead out of the gate, led the field through the bend then kicked to clear lead at the top of the lane but was caught in the
final yards. MOREISBETTER chased the pace three wide throughout and finished evenly in the lane. BLUES MARY attended the early pace on the inside,
backed out after failed to make the front nearing the three eighths and finished evenly in the lane to earn a minor share. FIVE ROSES LUNA broke a tad
slow then settled on the rail, advanced on the inside past the half mile pole then lacked room nearing the three eighths pole and after losing touch with the
leaders gained mildly late for a minor share. SIGICRICKET showed brief early speed then tracked three wide but failed to commence a bid in the lane.
SNOWTRICK lacked speed in the early going and failed to menace. GIO'S LIL ANGEL was distanced early and proved no factor.

Footnotes
MINISTER OF SOUL was off slow early, chased from midpack into the bend, shifted four wide at the three sixteenths pole and rallied down the crown of the
track to edge SHANNON C in the final yards. SHANNON C attended the early pace duel three wide into the turn, took a slight advantage at the top of the
lane then continued to hold a marginal lead in the final yards but was caught late. JAZZY TIMES broke well from the gate, showed brief early foot then
retreated to the rear of the field then swung five wide and rallied late to get up for show. CHESS MASTER forced the early pace of CHICKS DIG SCARS
then took the lead on the turn but weakened in the stretch. MISTER BANJOMAN settled midpack early then angled over to the inside nearing the half mile
pole, saved ground through the bend then shifted three wide at the top of the stretch before failing to respond late. LUVIN BULLIES was off slow then
tracked along the rail throughout and failed to make on rally into contention late. CHICKS DIG SCARS was sent to the lead from the inside, led briefly then
faded.
