TEMRIK broke on top, showed the way in hand, was let out some into the second bend, put to a drive upper stretch and kept to urging until just inside the
final sixteenth. MAGNITUDE TEN was prominent from outside, did not keep up into the second turn, was put to a drive with two furlongs to go, kept to
steady urging through the lane but was no match for TEMRIK. EFFLORESCE thrashed about when the gate opened then broke in the air, rushed up
between rivals to prompt the pace but began to yield before finishing five furlongs and was allowed to coast through the stretch. There was a stewards'
inquiry into EFFORESCE'S start. It was determined that EFFLORESCE was fully prepared for a clean start when the gate opened and the stewards took no
action.

REND LAKE BABY took her path inside the final furlong then gained second as she closed the gap some on WAR COLORS late. REND LAKE BABY was
hustled to a clear early lead, began to wear down with a furlong to go, drifted out under left-handed urging inside the eighth pole and slowly yielded. JOLIE
RULER prominent racing three wide, found herself boxed in behind the yielding REND LAKE BABY inside the final furlong, was altered out with a sixteenth

ORDAINED KISS gradually progressed from along the rail, fanned out entering the lane, altered out widest upper stretch, drifted out some further with a
furlong to go, was straightened, all out and got up in the final strides. KIPPER DOODLE was hustled to a clear lead, showed the way just off the inside,
drifted out entering the stretch, was under a steady drive but began to wear down in the late going. KALISPELL chased from outside, went for the lead on
the bend, was carried out by KIPPER DOODLE into the lane, lacked the extra needed deep stretch but was easily best of the others. STORMY EMPIRE
prominent between rivals, followed KIPPER DOODLE through the turn, moved to the inside upper stretch and flattened out. SHEZAHOTMAMA in tight
between horses midway on the backstretch, dropped back nearing the bend, angled to the outside and had no stretch bid.

began to draw off in the waning yards. TRY TRY AGAIN soon moved clear and took the inside on the first turn, shared the lead in hand on the backstretch,
was roused along the rail on the second turn, dueled through the lane under a steady drive but could only just hold second late. DEANO vied for the lead
between rivals, fought two wide in the stretch and also failed to have the needed late kick. KILLEEN contested the pace from outside once on the

I LUV THIS BAR pressed from inside, took the lead along the rail leaving the turn, floated out some entering the stretch, moved clear and held off
SUMMER'S WINNER under steady handling. SUMMER'S WINNER pressed from outside, was four wide on the bend, angled in some for the drive, gained
second nearing the final furlong, was all out, came up short but pulled away for the place. TAPALONG displayed early speed between rivals, was three wide
on the turn and began to gradually yield the last two furlongs. GHAALEB'S APPEAL was hustled along between horses, shuffled back some nearing the
turn, angled to the outside on the bend, came four wide into the stretch and failed to have a significant bid. TAP'S LULLABY chased staying off the inside,
had no stretch rally and lugged in late. AFOOLER vied for the lead just off the inside on the backstretch, did not keep up two wide on the bend, moved to the
rail entering the lane, continued to fade and was crowded by TAP'S LULLABY inside the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
ARCHIEMYBOY stalked STALLONE from just outside, rallied the final furlong and swept past the latter with seventy yards to go. STALLONE was
encouraged to a clear lead early, all out in the lane but did not have enough left in the waning yards. TWO BIT KID moved to the inside with four furlong left,
waited for room behind STALLONE on the bend, altered out midstretch for a clear path then had to alter out at the sixteenth marker and lacked the needed
late kick. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE broke in the air, was kept close running widest throughout but could only make up minor ground inside the last eighth.

Footnotes
HOMETOWN PROSPECT allowed to take a clear lead early, was roused leaving the quarter pole, under steady urging the final furlong and kept PRINCEEE
MANDII at bay. PRINCESS MANDII prompted the pace in hand just outside the leader, was all out through the lane, lacked the extra needed deep stretch
but was easily second best. DIAMOND STELLAR in contention early, moved to the inside with four furlongs to go, drew clear for third on the bend, came off
the inside some upper stretch, failed to close the gap on the top pair but was unchallenged for the show. MAJESTIC RAJ chased from along or just off the
rail and passed some tired ones in the stretch. SOUTHERN ATTACK raced in the second flight between horses on the backstretch but gave way from path
three on the turn. MYSTERY STAR helped prompt the pace from outside on the backstretch but faded widest on the bend and gradually lugged in through
the lane. BURKHART showed little.
