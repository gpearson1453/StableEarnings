Footnotes
SNAPY GAL forwardly placed, advanced on the far turn, responded to pressure and edged clear in the stretch. SUGAR SHACK QUEEN chased while three
wide, moved closer on the far turn and rallied while three wide in the stretch. KELA'S TURN came out at the start, gained the early lead, was challenged on
the far turn and kept on willingly in the stretch. DARK SILENCE failed to threaten. TOPLESS was bumped at the start and void of speed. GIRLS IN
CHARGE saved ground, faltered, bled and was vanned off.
