Footnotes
COUSIN WINNIE pressured the pace toward the inside and took the nod past the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn,
dueled clear mid-stretch and held well under steady encouragement. O K SMARTY PANTS was shut off by, and clipped the heels of, Worth A Peek on the
chute and lacked room early on, took aim approaching the quarter pole, raced at a close disadvantage three wide on the turn and finished well. LA CUBANA
set a pressured early pace then gave up the nod past the five sixteenths pole, dropped back from between horses midway on the turn, angled to the rail
nearing the eighth pole but flattened the final sixteenth. SILKY SERENA chased, raced off the rail on the turn and ran evenly through the lane. WORTH A
PEEK angled in across the path of O K Smarty Pants on the chute and had her heels clipped, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about
the three path and showed little further. MY JUBA gave chase toward the outside, raced in the five path of the turn and showed little more. BAYS CASTLE
chased outside, rounded the turn about the six path and showed little further.

Footnotes
VIOLANE settled off the pace inside, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, took the lead into the stretch, drew clear inside
the eighth pole and was steadily handled to widen. WHIZ PASS saved early ground then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, eased to the four path
rounding the far turn and dug in down the lane to take second under the wire. LIL SWEETHEART took the lead at the rail nearing the seven eighths pole
and rated the pace, came under pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the advantage toward the head of the lane then flattened the final
sixteenth. MOLLY BOLTS settled off the rail early then raced outside into the backstretch and gave chase from the half mile pole, ran in the five path of the
far turn and showed little in the lane. ZAP MAMA stalked from the three and four paths then challenged approaching the seven sixteenths pole, but dropped
back past the five sixteenths and weakened off the rail on the far turn. HARDSCRATCH had a brief early lead then stalked from the seven eighths pole,
gave chase into the backstretch but weakened in the four path of the far turn. EASY'S FINAL ROSE broke a bit awkwardly then rated close to the early pace
in the two and three paths, gave chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response.

Footnotes
TAMAQUA rated close while saving early ground then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, took the lead four wide approaching the five sixteenths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. LUCKY PENGUIN stalked early then moved to even terms past the nine
sixteenths pole, gave chase into the backstretch, dropped back leaving the five sixteenths and raced off the rail on the far turn, then steadily encouraged to
hold second. BRILLIANT IDEAS ran in the three and four paths the opening turn and raced outside entering the backstretch, bid past the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path and finished evenly. GRECIAN ADMIRAL was reluctant to load then saved ground the first turn, gave chase from
the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn, drifted into the stretch and finished evenly to pass rivals. REDOUBTABLE set the early pace
inside and was met past the nine sixteenths pole, dueled from that point but was caught approaching the five sixteenths and weakened near the rail on the
far turn. MASTER YOO raced in the four path the first turn then stalked three wide into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, though,
weakened off the rail on the far turn. RAVIN' MAVEN saved early ground and raced wide on the far turn.

WOLFINBARGER steadied from the heels of Owl Run past the five eighths pole then stalked off the rail, challenged toward the three eighths and took the
lead two deep nearing the five sixteenths, raced clear into the far turn, met the challenge of TEN TWENTY NINE leaving the turn and dug in determinedly to
get the nod, while the latter stalked from the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and moved to even terms two deep midway on the
far turn, dueled gamely through the stretch but missed the nod. OWL RUN closed to the front and moved to the inside past the five eighths pole to rate the
pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths, gave up the nod approaching the five sixteenths and dropped back into the far turn, ran in the three
path through the turn and finished evenly. PEPPI THE HUNTER saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the
far turn, then flattened the final furlong. IRISHTOWN raced off the rail the first turn then gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about
the five path and ran evenly to late stretch. THE IRON BANK saved early ground, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four
path and showed little further. CLICKJAB steadied lightly leaving the gate and rounded the opening turn about the four path, gave chase from the three
eighths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
RACHEL'S WISH stalked in the three path the first turn then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, took the nod two deep past the quarter, contested the
edge through the far turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well under steady encouragement. CHOSEN MISS saved ground off the pace the opening
turn then gave chase leaving the nine sixteenths pole, lacked a clear path through the far turn, but angled to the rail at the eighth pole and recovered stride,
dug in from that point and took second later yards. BOTTLE COURAGE entered the opening turn about the four patht then bid into the backstretch, raced
five wide on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. OHH BEEHAVE rounded the first turn in the four path then started an outside bid
into the backstretch, rounded the far turn six wide and finished well; outside. BOBBINI took the lead at the thirteen sixteenths pole and angled to the inside
to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail into the far turn, dropped back mid-stretch and flattened stride.
FORT ZANNA saved ground the opening turn, bid toward the three eighths pole and raced two deep on the far turn, then flattened inside the sixteenth pole.
SPEEDING TICKET raced boxed at the rail the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and raced close at the rail on the far turn, then
weakened the final furlong. COLETTE'S SPIRIT settled just off the earlier pace in the three and four paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn four wide then weakened. GRANDMA SCHNUR was reluctant to load then closed toward contention and stalked two deep, challenged
approaching the three eighths pole, but weakened into the far turn.
