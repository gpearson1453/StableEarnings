Footnotes
BEARAKONTIE took the lead after initial strides and raced two wide into the first turn, opened up on top and held firm around the far turn, was put to a drive
at the head of the lane, had more left in reserve and held clear under steady pressure. BESS raced behind the leader around the first turn and continued to
track rival through early stages, launched a bid for BEARAKONTIE leaving the backstretch, cut into the leaders margin then stayed on three wide into the
lane, could not reach the winner but finished clearly second best. WICKED SOLUTION raced off the clear top pair through the backstretch, was ridden along
four wide into the lane and never threatened.

COLBALOAF settled through early stages, saved ground around the far turn, launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, took a slim lead past the eighth pole
then dug in gamely under pressure and held firm. MONGOLIAN HERO rated through the backstretch, picked up the pace near the inside around the far
turn, angled out turning for home, roused forward into striking distance but could not get by the game winner. TORRES DEL PAINE tracked the pacesetter
through early stages, dueled outside of HELMS DEEP around the far turn, held a slim lead in the upper stretch then got overtaken when the top pair surged
by. LIVE FIRE stalked through the backstretch, hustled up four wide into the upper stretch then chased on evenly. CLAW raced in range through early
stages, roused three to four wide past the quarter pole then failed to kick on. HELMS DEEP set the pace through the backstretch, dueled inside of TORRES
DEL PAINE around the far turn, fought back in the upper stretch gave way and finished on equal terms with JOZANI RVF. JOZANI R V F raced in the back,
went five wide into the lane, lacked a needed rally and finished on equal terms with HELMS DEEP. MIZZEN MONEY rated near midpack and had no
response when called upon. TRI TRY COLORS raced off the pace, urged three wide into the lane and failed to move into close contention. SPOT OF GOLD
saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace then went four wide into the lane and never menaced.

UNCLE ROAMIE broke alertly, quickly cleared and crossed over to the inside, held firm around the turn, went three wide into the drive, rebroke under
pressure and stayed sharp. DREAMING OF GERRY raced two wide between foes at the quarter pole, roused three wide into the lane, sustained a steady
bid and lasted for place. VICTORY ANTHEM lacked early foot and raced in the back, swung out wide turning for home, rallied along the outside and just
missed place. LIL MAJESTY was a a step awkward at the start, ran up the inside and quickly moved into contention, sustained a two wide bid in the upper
stretch then flattened out. IRISH LION raced in the last flight, saved ground into the lane and needed more for impact. READTHETRANSCRIPT raced four
deep in range at the quarter pole then gave way. MAC NINETY was forwardly placed in opening stages, chased three wide around the turn then weakened
in the lane.

CASBY raced off the early pace, hustled up around the far turn, raced five wide into the lane and failed to move on. POCOPSON STATION rated near
mid-pack, urged around the far turn, raced three to four wide into the lane and had no response. HERO'S HOPE dropped back after the half and was easing
up to the wire.
