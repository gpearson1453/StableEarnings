Footnotes
CENTSLESS DRAMA broke to the lead, controlled matters through an even early pace, responded as needed turning for home and stayed clear under
pressure. EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE was reserved early inside, shifted two wide rallying into second near the quarter-pole, could not reach the winner and
lasted for the place. STARSHIP MALLOMAR raced in the two-path for six furlongs, cut the corner into the lane, moved out leaving the furlong grounds and
just missed outside EXTRAVAGANT ROSE for the runner-up spot. RAKI saved ground unhurried early, had room inside at the top of the stretch, but was
one-paced to the finish. BEAN COUNTER prompted CENTSLESS DRAMA from outside for six furlongs, and tired. SHADILEE was widest into the first turn
near the four-path, and retired early.

Footnotes
ALONZO stalked the pace two wide, could not keep pace while under a drive from the three-eighths to upper stretch, responded in the lane, moved to the
front near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead from there. KHOZY MY BOY set the pace along the rail, widened nearing the lane, held the sixteenth pole
and fought on inside of the winner to hold well clear of the rest. CREATIVE CLOUD was off a step slow, chased the pace three and four wide and churned
on to be a clear third. FIRST RULE chased the pace two and three wide and lacked a closing bid. SOSOSUBTLE was shuffled back soon after the start,
rushed up between foes down the backstretch and faded around the turn. MAJESTIC LUNA was outrun inside. FAST LOADED broke awkwardly, was up
close inside for a half and retreated through the lane.

BLUSHING KEYLEN pressed GREATEST GLORY from outside, poked a head in front with a quarter-mile remaining, edged clear through midstretch, shied
out greenly from left-hand pressure late and had enough to hang on. CHESS NOT CHECKERS brushed with BIG SURPRISE at the start, saved ground
outsprinted for three furlongs, moved out widest coming off the turn, began to gain past the eighth-pole and was getting to the winner from outside in the
closing strides. BIG SURPRISE brushed with CHESS NOT CHECKERS at the start, raced three wide off the leaders in the clear through the turn, made no
appreciable headway through midstretch, altered course outside BLUSHING KEYLEN late and had to be carefully handled between the latter and CHESS
NOT CHECKERS nearing the finish. GREATEST GLORY was sent hard from the gate inside, got collared by the eventual winner on the turn, and
weakened through the drive. RACHEL DREAM was outrun inside. KNIGHTS SWORD was four wide entering the turn, and could not keep pace
approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
SOPE settled off the pace inside, split rivals nearing the eighth pole, took a short lead near the sixteenth pole and dug in between foes to prevail.
DISCREET TUNE broke a bit awkwardly, moved up inside down the backstretch, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths pole, continued on the left lead
in the lane, bid outside of the winner near the sixteenth pole and could not get past. WORK ETHIC dueled along the rail to deep stretch and was outfinished
late. EMICRACK (CHI) dueled two wide for a half and weakened. VALID EXCHANGE never threatened while racing two wide. GRAND UNION saved
ground to no avail. SMALL REASON was outrun inside. JUST LIKE MIKE played no factor while racing two wide. LUCKY AS A SEVEN was outrun while
racing four wide. SMOKE ALARM had early speed three wide, lost the whip near the quarter pole and retreated through the lane. SOUL DANCER was
outrun while racing three wide. FLORALA AL trailed in the five path.

Footnotes
VOLATA was outrun for three furlongs, began to advance past the quarter-pole, rallied in the two-path through the stretch, caught CREATIVE GIRL from
inside 70 yards out and held off BATTLE CHARGE to the wire. BATTLE CHARGE lost ground to the leaders around the turn, lacked room on the fence
inside LEVIOSA coming to the top of the lane, gained through the furlong grounds in the two-path, altered course outside CREATIVE GIRL in deep stretch
and narrowly missed. CREATIVE GIRL raced well off the rail setting a pressured pace inside MISS CENTRAL, moved clear from the latter into the stretch
five or six wide, drifted in through midstretch shortening stride on her left lead, and was overhauled from both flanks. LEVIOSA brushed the right side of the
gate coming out, moved in from the four-path to the rail through the run around the turn, and lacked a closing bid inside. READY TO RUMBLE became
fractious during the loading process unseating the rider behind the gate, came away in good order and was outrun two to three wide. MISS CENTRAL
pressed CREATIVE GIRL from outside, got floated out to the middle of the track by that rival coming off the turn, and gave way. CHANGE PLANS was
outrun early, and dropped far back before reaching the stretch. MOLLIES HOPE got off to a stutter-step start, was outsprinted early and dropped far back
after three furlongs.

Footnotes
THE DISTRACTOR hustled through inside GATSBY to take over through the first sixteenth of a mile, sped away through fast fractions, remained clear to 70
yards out, and was all out to stave off FLAMINGO HAWK in the final strides. FLAMINGO HAWK saved ground outsprinted into the turn, remained well back
angling to the far outside at the top of the stretch, kicked in past the furlong marker and was gobbling up ground too late. GATSBY broke to the lead but was
soon overtaken by THE DISTRACTOR, chased outside the latter to the stretch three wide, and could not gain through the late stages. MISTER LUIGI was
put to a drive on the turn three then four wide, and made no appreciable headway. LITTLE DEMON faded steadily after a half-mile. SHANGHAI RONNIE
moved in unable to keep pace through the run around the turn, and dropped far back.
