Footnotes
LUCKILY pressed the pace three wide along the backstretch, gained command entering the turn, was along the inside at upper stretch and finished under a
drive to secure the win. HALE'S ANGEL was unhurried along the backstretch, trailed the field into the bend, and rallied strongly up the rail to earn the place.
SHES THE BEAST stalked the pace from a two path stance down the backstretch, swung to three wide at upper stretch and finished willingly for the show.
FAST DOWN THE LANE flashed early foot and led the field as the inner most rival of three abreast at the conclusion of backstretch but failed to sustain the
bid and came up empty in final furlong. FUN FACTS lost ground to front runners by traveling widest of all.

Footnotes
GRACIE G showed interest in command shortly after the start, shared the lead through the half while trekking the two path, and shook that rival off in the
final eighth for the score. AFLEET OKIE settled into the second flight, gave chase to front runners through the first turn, then closed with a rush in the final
stages to earn the place honors. GEORGIANO rushed from outset to establish a ground saving stance, set the early pace in tandem with GRACIE G, but
gave way to top pair in the crucial portion of contest. FLYRTIE ROCKETTE showed reserve from outset and trailed the field through the opening half before
passing a tiring foe in the late going. SKIPPERLITTTLEGIRL chased from a three wide stance early, rated along the inside at upper stretch, and tired in the
end.

BRAINSTORM rushed form outset to set the pace in unison with RIVER RULER, trekked along the inside in tandem with that foe around both turns, then
locked into a stretch duel and prevailed over that rival for the honors. RIVER RULER hustled away at the break and established a two path stance, the led
the field in tandem with BRAINSTORM through both bends before being outdueled in the homestretch by that rival. CRUISIN CUE showed patience in the
early going, saved gorund through the bends, and improved placing with late interest. MALIBU PRINCE trailed the field through the opening half, rated
widest of all at upper stretch, and passed tiring rival in late going. BEST YEAR YET tired in crucial stages after giving chase from a two path pose and rating
mid pack.

HEY ROXY came away alertly and established an inside stance while rating up front, gained command shortly after the first call, was challenged nearing the
conclusion of the backstretch, then shook clear in the final furlong. RARE POPPY stalked the pace from second flight into and around the opening turn,
angled out to three wide near the quarter pole, led the second flight from a two path pose at upper stretch, and proved to be best of rest in the end. WHEW
finished full of run to secure the show after trailing the field from outset through the half and traveling widest of all. A J'S GRAND saved ground to no avail.
DIAMOND LEGACY hustled from outset and led the field into the first call before eclipsing in the latter half of contest.

RUMBLING THUNDER pressed the pace along the backstretch, rated three wide at upper stretch, came under a tiff drive and got up in the final jump for the
score. WORK CONQUERS ALL rushed from outset and led the field down the backstretch, saved ground through the bend, had a slight lead in deep stretch
and was caught in the final stride. RUN ETHAN RUN lacked a rally after settling into second flight and giving chase from a two path stance. HERE'S YOUR
DRINK threatened mildly from a back rated pose. RUN FREE weakened at the end of a ground saving trip. GENTLE GEORGE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SHERRY BABE broke alertly and trekked the two path into and around the first turn while rating just off the heels of pacesetter, gained command at head of
backstretch, then shook clear midway and finished in hand for the clear score. LANDRY KYLE was unhurried in early strides, was lightly roused at top of
backstretch, then patiently circled rivals through the final half to earn the place. MISS ORIENTA showed reserve from outset and settled in behind the early
front runners around the opening bend, closed gap on leaders approaching quarter pole, then split rivals near the three sixteenths pole under a mild rally to
secure the show. OKIE FRONT flashed early speed and led the field through the first call before backing out in the late stages. MISS TYRO settled into mid
pack, rated between rivals inside the quarter pole and faded in closing strides. TERRIS STRONG HOPE failed to threaten while saving ground.

PLINKY stalked the pace while hugging the rail through the opening bend, maintained that line throughout and wore down the leader in final furlong with a
rail rally. RARE WARRIOR broke alertly and assumed first command, led the field from a two path stance into deep stretch, but was unable to fend off the
rail rally of PLINKY in the closing strides. ORPHAN ANGIE was unhurried into and around the first turn, closed the gap on front runner along the
backstretch, and just missed the place with a late rush, all while trekking three wide throughout. SWIFT JUSTICE lacked a needed rally after settling into
mid pack early and traveling widest of all at upper stretch. DIRTY DANCER passed a tiring rival after giving chase from a back rated pose. S S SUPER
SPORT showed early interest and pressed the pace from a two path position through the first turn before tiring in the late going.

Footnotes
DESTINY'S LOVE rushed away at break and established a two path position, gained instant command and refused to relish that command for a gate to wire
score. EUROBOND broke behind the field, was roused midway down the backstretch, and rallied with a fury through the bend as the widest of all to earn the
place. FETCHUM KETCHUM failed to match strides with top pair in final furlong after showing hustle early and pressing the pace from a ground saving
stance. BAPTISM pressed the pace as the widest of three abreast, maintained that line through the bend and at upper stretch, but came up empty in the
final furlong. CROSSBOW CIMARRON settled into mid pack, took a ground saving trip around the hook, then angled out at upper stretch to no avail.
CALICHE RIDGE failed to menace from a back rated pose. TIME TO FIGHT broke alertly and was checked near the five sixteenths pole, losing ground to
front runners.

POPPY'S OATS settled into mid pack in the early strides and trekked the three path through the first turn before responding to asking along the backstretch,
gaining command through the final bend, and finishing under a stiff drive for the score. EUROEAST rushed from outset to share early command from a two
path stance, led the field at conclusion of backstretch, but could not fend off the late charge of eventual winner in final furlong. SPECIAL FORTUNE traveled
widest of all rivals around both bends and finished willingly to secure the show. ARTIC EXPRESS flashed early speed and faded steadily in the latter portion
of contest. SLICK RAY was no menace while trailing the field from well behind.

Footnotes
HANSENS MISCHIEF rushed form outset and opened a comfortable margin early and led every step of the way for a clear victory. WRITTEN PERMISSION
settled into the second flight as the widest of all rivals, trekked the widest path around both turns and proved second best behind a tough winner. MEGA
BOND established a two path position shortly after the start, led the second flight from that stance through both turns, then was edged in final strides by
WRITTEN PERMISSION for the place honors. FRESH ONE lacked a late rally after giving chase from a three path stance. SHANGHAI SKIPPER was
unhurried in the opening half and improved placing with mild late interest. ON THE BRIDGE saved ground to no avail. TEXAS GOLD RUSH trekked three
wide through the first turn and rated mid pack before tiring inside the quarter pole.

Footnotes
MACHA'S REWARD hustled from outset to dispute the early command as the outer most rival of four abreast through the first turn, came under rousing
near the five sixteenths pole, gained command prior to the quarter pole, tucked to the inside around the final bend, and finished under a drive to secure the
score. INTIMIDATING followed the early pacesetters into the opening turn, then steadily advanced position while travelling the two path to earn the place.
MIGHTY BUGSY settled into second flight in the early going, angled out to three wide through the final bend and rallied in the homestretch to secure the
show. SWAGATTACK trailed the field from outset to the quarter pole before improving placing with late interest. KURTS RAIDER came up empty and
lacked a late bid after giving chase from a four wide stance early early and trekking three wide at upper stretch. MAJOR SHIPMAN flashed early speed and
led the field around the first bend from an inside stance before eclipsing in the crucial stages. SWISS MINISTER steadily retreated after pressing the early
pace from a two path route.
