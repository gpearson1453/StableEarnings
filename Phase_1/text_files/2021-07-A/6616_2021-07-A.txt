Footnotes
OUT ON SATURDAY switched off the inside soon after the start while in the clear to dictate terms from the four path, moved in just a bit on that first turn,
faced pressure from an inside foe from about the seven-sixteenths, was headed by that one into the far turn going three wide on that bend, regained
command coming out of it and was clear into upper stretch then extended the margin while being kept to task. LINCOLN COUNTY KID settled off the leader
in the two path, moved up inside that rival to force the issue but still off the rail, put a narrow head in front about the five-sixteenths but could not match
strides and was second best. TOX stalked the pace from outside, went four to five wide on both turns, lacked the needed late kick. GERDA'S GONE
exchanged a very light bump at the start, settled at the rear racing wide going five to six wide early, advanced past rivals up the backstretch, continued six
wide on the far turn, lugged out in mid-stretch upon left-handed use of the crop, the rider then switched to vigorous hand urging and ran on. MR. NASTY
exchanged a very light bump at the break then was in tight quarters just slightly heading into the first turn, went three wide on that bend off the leaders,
continued three then four wide on the far turn and ran on evenly in the stretch. OFF THE WAGON saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
MISS LUBBOCK tracked the early leaders, moved up inside just off the rail to take the lead past the three-eighths, edged away on the turn, was well clear
into upper stretch, drifted out a bit but held safe. ZONNA set the early tempo from outside, moved in to the three path passing the half-mile marker, was
overtaken leaving the backstretch, proved no match for the winner but kept on gamely to capture the place. INDIAN SECRET switched outside ZONNA
midway up the backstretch, edged to nearly even terms with that rival approaching the furlong marker having gone four wide on the turn but had no extra
and settled for show honors. TWENTYFOUR K CAT failed to rally while racing inside on or just off the rail. TERAS SILENCE was outside and up close
early, entered the turn six wide tucking in behind rivals four wide about the quarter pole, had no rally. SELFISH WOMAN failed to rally racing five wide and
between runners into the turn. TOWER WAGON was encouraged along but lacking speed, was not a factor.

Footnotes
RITZY STORM exchanged a bump at the break, set the tempo from outside a rival kept quite wide, went four then three then four wide on the turn edging
clear into upper stretch, kept to the task late. FEISTY HALO switched off the inside early, went in the two then three path on the turn put to urging, drift in
then out a bit in the lane but got up for the place. THE PACESETTER exchanged a hard bump at the break nearly unseating the rider, tracked in behind
three to four wide on the turn, came out five wide into upper stretch, was outkicked for the place. CONNIE'S LINDA stalked outside going five wide on the
turn, came into upper stretch seven deep and ran on. COOL AND QUICK was close up early racing inside, saved ground on the turn, checked and had to
alter out nearing the furlong marker, showed good late stride. IRON TUFF vied inside a rival but off the fence in the two to three path, weakened. CATTY
DOM was not a factor racing off the inside in the three to four path through the turn.

Footnotes
REAL ME set the pace outside facing pressure from inside rivals into the turn going four wide on that bend, was asked for more at the quarter pole and
responded by taking command, cleared off under a drive and was geared down in the final strides. RIGGED TO RUN was fowardly-placed under
encouragement to contend for the lead inside, dueled from just off the rail inside the winner from the three-eighths to the quarter pole but proved no match.
THE LIDS OFF was forwardly-positioned between runners with some coaxing, was in tight quarters entering the turn and quickly dropped back, moved from
three to four wide subsequently on that bend and finished well in the drive. TS QUEEN OF SASS exchanged a light bump at the break, raced off the leading
trio while wide, went four to six deep on the turn and ran evenly. REAL PENNY was a bit fractious leaving the paddock and start of the post parade, raced
outside foes well back seven deep into the turn, eased back and shifted in early on that bend being three wide by the quarter pole, ran on with mild interest
to improve position. RIG RIDER was bumped then forced to check after the break, advanced inside rivals on or just off the rail on the turn but could not
sustain the effort. UNDER RAPPES failed to rally after racing six wide through the turn. JASMINE WHO exchanged a light bump at the start then veered in
and bumped a rival hard soon after, was mid-pack up the backstretch, dropped back five wide on the turn, angled out eight wide in upper stretch and had
nothing more. VICTORY JAZZ broke in and steadied slightly, raced well back in the two path and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
LET IT ROLL was outsprinted in the early going, weaved around foes steadily advancing on the turn first four wide then shifting to the rail then back out
around the leader at the head of the lane, drew clear. SHEZA DANDY R F was forwardly-positioned early, continued the pursuit three wide, kept on for the
plae. BOBBI BABY RUN was urged forward inside, dictated the pace on a clear lead, saved ground on or just off the rail on the turn, weakened when
headed. MINDOFMYOWN was just lightly bumped after the break, failed to rally racing outside four wide. BULLY BABY bumped the outer rival just lightly
after the break, shifted in about the seven-sixteenths, went two to three wide on the turn but was unable to threaten.
