Footnotes
WARREN'S WISH broke sharply, dictated the pace while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily widened the margin on the far turn and
drew away through the stretch while being kept to steady pressure. CHARMING FURY was rated tracking just off the pacesetter while switching outside that
foe racing to the backstretch but couldn't maintain striking distance racing into the far turn. POPPIN TOPS broke inwards bumping TAHKODHA LUV, was
righted to track the leaders off the inside to the backstretch but faded early. TAHKODHA LUV, stumbled, then was bumped at the start and never menaced
thereafter while besting a rival for a position in the final sixteenth. DESERT ARCH, reluctant loading in the gate, dropped out early.

Footnotes
ROMAN PHAROAH broke readily, forced the pace outside a rival to gain the advantage after the opening quarter, went clear racing through the turn,
steadily widened the margin and was gathered up in the closing stages to prevail in a ridden out effort. BIG WHISKEY tracked the leaders three deep in
second flight racing through the backstretch, then continued in that path through the lane to narrowly prevail for the place honors late. WHERE'S FREDO
settled off the second flight outside a rival racing to the turn, split foes just off the inside in late stages and just missed for second. DIRTY DEEDS, urged
along the inside prompting a rival's pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way nearing the lane. MEDICINE MAN tracked off the first flight along
the inside and steadily faded leaving the turn. PILOT PRINCE settled along the inside early and failed to menace. TIZNOW THE WINNER tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight but emptied out early.

MINNESOTA LUCKY broke readily, was urged to gain the lead outside a rival racing into the first turn, went clear nearing the backstretch while angling to
the inside, widened his advantage racing into upper stretch under pressure and finished on his own courage nearing the wire once the issue was decided.
CANDY WOMPUS was prompted to a position outside a rival in second flight tracking the leader from just out of striking distance racing to the far turn,
couldn't close the gap on the winner but continued gamely to edge a rival for the place honors late. PURELY POLITICAL settled off the second flight along
the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance but was just outkicked for second. DANZ

Footnotes
LULUMARU, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance nearing upper stretch, gradually
moved to terms wresting the advantage leaving the furlong marker and edged clear under firm right handed encouragement. THAT'STHEWAYTODOIT
broke readily, was urged along the inside setting the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, resisted the winner's bid past midstretch and just lasted for
the place honors. EBONY BAY angled inwards tracking off the first flight racing inside a rival into the backstretch, tipped out in upper stretch while being
prompted to advance but finished evenly late while missing for second. SUNDEREYA was rated off the second flight racing a bit off the inside to the far turn,
angled inside foes entering the stretch but had no closing bid. KIMBERLY FRANCES settled last racing to the far turn, then shifted out nearing the lane to
race between foes in the closing stages but offered no rally. M AND M GIRL, caught three wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards to track the leaders
outside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the far turn, then gave way outside foes racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
SNEAKY DIANNE was urged to the lead while angling to the rail racing into the first turn, dueled for command inside a rival to the far turn, dispatched that
foe nearing upper stretch, then repelled several challenges racing through the lane and shook clear late under strong handling. MOCHA KISS ducked in at
the start, was quickly righted to track off the first flight along the inside racing to the far turn, tipped out three deep nearing upper stretch to bid for command
between foes entering the lane but lacked the needed final kick. CHARMING FLIRT tracked off the second flight shifting out four wide, then three wide
racing to the backstretch, gained on the leaders four wide racing into the far turn, advanced in tandem with a rival to challenge three deep nearing upper
stretch but flattened out in late stages. GP'S AMAZING GRACE was urged to terms with the eventual winner prompting the pace outside that foe from the
outset to the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. CITY GONE COUNTRY, caught in close quarters in the opening stages, was held up to track just off
the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the backstretch but emptied out abruptly entering the far turn. GIO'S LIL ANGEL settled last early and
never gained contention. Race times updated after data review.

DEVIL VISION, reserved along the inside dropping out last racing to the backstretch, angled outside foes racing four wide through the far turn and produced
a steady response to rally to the front in the closing stages to gain the advantage in time. HOLD THE SPICE was settled outside foes while racing last to the
first turn, was prompted to advance three deep racing into the far turn, gained striking distance in that path racing into upper stretch, outkicked. TURN THE
SWITCH switched off inside tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, took over racing through the far turn, held sway to upper stretch but failed to
sustain that momentum. STAR OF STARS was rated off the second flight along the inside, saved ground on the far turn to upper stretch and continued with
interest to improve position to late stages. WHERE'D THE DAY GO tracked off the leaders outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance nearing the lane but had had no closing bid. MISCHIEVOUS MO angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, was
shuffled back behind a tiring foe nearing the lane, shifted out in upper stretch but faded in the drive. CINTAROSA RANCH sped to the lead while angling to
the inside, set the pace to the far turn and gave way abruptly nearing the lane. DIGITAL STAR tracked off the second flight three wide racing to the
backstretch and dropped out after a half.

Footnotes
SARJENALLI, urged to prompt the pace while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, dueled for command inside a rival racing into the far turn, lost ground
to a rival nearing midstretch but came back gamely inside foes in the closing stages to regain the advantage in time under firm handling. COME ON SWEET
PEA, caught four wide racing through the first turn tracking just off the second flight, made a steady advanced in that path through the far turn to upper
stretch to loom outside the leaders late but was just outkicked. MISSYINTOMISCHIEF sped to the lead outside a rival racing to the first turn to gain a narrow
advantage, forced the pace outside that foe through the backstretch into the far turn, edged forward to a clear advantage nearing midstretch but faltered
between foes late. LADY ASTRID tracked just off leaders between rivals in second flight racing to the far turn, then continued evenly in late stages. FADED
MEMORIES tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight racing to the far turn and faded in late stages. MAIDEN ROCK settled last along the
inside racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. DELLA FROST raced three deep between foes in second flight racing to the far turn and
emptied out nearing the lane. Race times updated after data review.

Footnotes
UNCLE GOYLE broke readily, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace racing into the turn, shook clear in upper stretch and maintained a safe advantage
to the end under firm encouragement. GIANT GAMBLE, prompted to a forward placing while angling inwards, tracked off the first flight along the inside
racing into the turn, tipped out entering upper stretch and continued with interest to close the gap on the winner between foes. C DUB tracked the pace
between foes in second flight, shifted three wide nearing the lane to gain striking distance and continued with interest to the end while being outkicked for
second. HOTFOOT tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest inside foes to improve position.
SAMURAI MIKE angled to the rail while settling well off the leaders racing to the turn and passed inside tiring rivals late. P CLUB, off last, shifted off the
inside racing into the turn, angled six wide in upper stretch and was prompted make some belated progress. SUPERIOR'S BOY tracked the leaders three
wide in second flight in early stages, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and faded in the drive. SAVED BY ZERO was urged forcing the pace outside
the eventual winner, drifted out racing into upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
TORENO forced the pace outside foes from the outset to the turn, shook clear while shifting inwards leaving the three furlong marker, held sway on a clear
margin past midstretch and held safe the late challenge of MY GOLDEN DAY under firm encouragement. The latter was settled while angling to the rail in
early stages, saved ground entering the turn gathering momentum, swung out four wide in upper stretch and continued with a late response to close the gap
on the winner nearing the wire. MACHOS VISION tracked just off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest
inside foes to prevail for a share. UNDECIDEDCERTAINTY settled outside foes dropping well off the second flight racing to the turn, angled out five wide
nearing midstretch and continued with interest to improve position. HOWMUCHISTOOMUCH tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn,
shifted out three wide entering upper stretch but had no final kick. TASMIN settled last racing to upper stretch and proved no threat. EMERALD PRINCESS
was urged prompting the pace between foes, then along the inside racing to the turn, conceded some position to the winner while switching outside that foe
nearing upper stretch and gave out in the drive. MODERN MUSE, reserved off the second flight just off the inside racing to the turn, offered no rally.

Footnotes
PASSTHECAT was urged prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, took over entering the far turn, held sway on a narrow advantage into upper
stretch and grudgingly held ME AND ROSE to the end in an all out drive. The latter gained a position outside a rival tracking just off the leaders to the
backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing the lane while being prompted to advance, drew on terms with the winner late following a prolonged drive but
was just outkicked. GUEST CHECK tracked the leaders inside a rival as part of the flight, shifted off the inside on the far turn, swung out nearing midstretch
and prevailed for a share. SHAKELAS DESTINY tracked off the second flight outside rivals to the backstretch, was fanned four wide nearing the lane, was
bumped nearing midstretch and finished evenly late. HOT ARTIE settled last outside foes racing to the backstretch and passed only tiring rivals.
HISMUDDAWASAMUDDA tracked off the second flight between foes to the far turn, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch, shied avoiding GUEST
CHECK while bumping SHAKELAS DESTINY, altered course to the inside midstretch but quickly emptied. R DEJA VOO, urged to the lead along the inside
racing to the backstretch, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and gave out nearing the lane.
