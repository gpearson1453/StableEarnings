Footnotes
LOVELY LADY LEXI coaxed from the gate, dueled two to three wide with EXCESS CAPACITY to her inside, took over command near the five-sixteenths,
came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held
well kept to task to the finish. MONGOLIAN HUMOR tossed her head getting away a half a beat slow, chased along the inside down the backstretch and
then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the place honors.
PERSIAN QUEEN chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside
into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. AWESOME ALANA coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, swung
four wide for home, kept on to the finish but was outkicked. EXCESS CAPACITY coaxed from the start, dueled along the inside of LOVELY LADY LEXI,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front near the five-sixteenths, angled out three to four wide into upper stretch, folded and was eased
through to the wire.

Footnotes
VOLIERO was rated while given cover behind horses, traveled around most of the turn in the two path, shifted four wide while given his cue inside the
five-sixteenths, rallied outside into upper stretch then jostled with an opponent, closed strongly to get the lead nearing the furlong marker and held under
strong urging. DREAMPOINT brushed with a rival at the start, was reserved in the back half of the field while given cover, went three then four wide on the
turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths then came five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and finished with good energy while unable to
reach the winner but was clear for the place. MASKED MARAUDER brushed with a rival at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, rounded the turn in the
two path, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths, took the lead at the quarter-pole then was put to a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner
just before the furlong marker and was outfinished while just able to get the show. NOBLE CONQUEST dropped back early then was reserved while into the
bit, went two then three wide on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the crop, moved out in the vicinity of the furlong
marker and improved position to just miss the show. SPIRITUAL KING went to the front, showed the way through solid fractions while off the rail, dropped to
the inside entering the turn, was asked under threat at the five-sixteenths then headed at the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened. JACK'S DREAM settled on the outside while racing without cover, stalked three wide on the turn, was coaxed along passing the five-sixteenths
then came under stronger encouragement approaching the quarter-pole, jostled with a foe in upper stretch and tired. GATEWAY GUARDIAN settled off the
pace, went two to three wide on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch and failed to respond. ON MICK'S DAY broke in at the start, settled
towards the rear of the field, was asked in the two path on the turn and was no factor. ADDICTED TO YOU veered in at the start then was hustled, moved
up then took an awkward stride coming to the seven-eighths, raced just off the pace, dropped back under urging while inside on the far turn and capitulated.
SUGAR PLUM KING bobbled after the start, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn and trailed.

Footnotes
GENTLE ANNIE tossed her head at the start and was off to a tangled beginning conceding five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased
five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch detached at the tail of the field, tucked to the two path through the turn and was patiently handled until
set down spinning three wide for home, angled in a path inside the eighth pole rallying to split the top pair inside the final sixteenth getting up with good
courage to score on the wire. EXTRA EFFORT hustled from the gate, showed the way coaxed along in the two path down the backstretch and then along
the inside through the turn, spun three wide for home, dug in under threat and was nailed in the very last jumps to the finish. TENDERNESS chased along
the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, continued just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive rallying through the
final furlong to be heads apart for command through to the finish but simply could not go by and was ultimately rebuffed to the finish. LEFT LEANING LUCY
four paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened in the late stages. HAPPY SOPHIA chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung five wide for home and weakened in the late going. KERIK hustled from the start, chased five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered no response.

Footnotes
PUBLIC INFORMATION broke out and bobbled then bumped with a foe, was taken in hand early then reserved while saving ground, remained on hold
while behind horses on the far turn, angled out then bumped and bothered AMISTAD outside the quarter-pole, created room for himself in the three path,
rallied between horses under a hand ride to gain the advantage before the furlong marker, moved clear inside the sixteenth-pole and held under confident
hand urging while surprised by the fast closing runner-up. JARREAU was reluctant to load, saved ground while rated under a snug hold, drafted behind
horses while traveling in front of PUBLIC INFORMATION on the far turn, waited while blocked from the quarter-pole to near the eighth-pole and steadied,
altered out several paths shortly thereafter, rallied on the outside and closed fast to just miss in an unlucky journey. K. K. ICHIKAWA dropped from the two
path to the rail while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole then came
under a drive into upper stretch, lost the lead nearing the furlong marker and was outfinished while able to get the show. BRINGING THE HEAT raced inside
to the two path on the first turn, tracked the pace down the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the two path, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, made a
bid then battled between horses under a drive in upper stretch and was out-kicked then just missed the show. AMISTAD bumped with an opponent at the
start, raced two to three wide while reserved off the pace, was roused at the five-sixteenths, checked approaching the quarter-pole when bumped by
PUBLIC INFORMATION and forced into MORE LIKE IT, regained some momentum inside the three-sixteenths and finished willingly to just miss the
superfecta. MORE LIKE IT bumped solidly with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, bobbled early on the backstretch, settled in third position
on the outside, went three wide on the final turn, was bumped four wide into the stretch and came up empty. SCOTTY bumped soundly with a rival at the
start, went three wide on the opening bend then dropped in, lagged at the rear, saved ground under urging on the far turn and was no factor. FOLLOWING
A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF AMISTAD AGAINST THE WINNER AND A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, PUBLIC INFORMATION WAS DISQUALFIED
FROM FIRST AND PLACED FIFTH FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE QUARTER-POLE

Footnotes
READY A. P. got bumped at the start by the outwards breaking HELENS SPIRIT and was forced to steady as PRINCESSINPARADISE recovered inwards
from a bobble and conceded three to four lengths to the front, got lightly coaxed and advanced to quickly close ground chasing three then two wide and
moving into contention with seven-sixteenths to go, latched on the leader nearing the quarter pole before taking over command swinging three then two
wide straightened away for home, got roused briefly straightened away, went clear in hand through to the finish receiving intermittent taps to the right side
shoulder. ONE TRACK MINE hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside under urging from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home,
proved no match for the top one while improving position to secure the place honors. SWEET SUGAR BABY hustled from the start, chased three paths off
the inside before tucking inside through the turn forwardly placed, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened while along for the show
honors. DARN THAT SONG coaxed from the gate, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way lightly coaxed four paths off the inside
before crossing inside safely clear into the turn, rode the rail through the bend coming under growing threat to the outside, took the inside route into upper
stretch displaced from command, then weakened to the finish. PRINCESSINPARADISE bobbled at the break recovering inwards forcing READY A. P. to
steady in behind, chased inside before tipping three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and tired.
HELENS SPIRIT broke out at the start brushing the off side stall before bumping READY A.P., chased along the inside and then just off the inside through
the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and trailed.

EVIDENCE BASED broke in and was off a step slow, settled in the middle of the field while given cover, traveled around the turn in the three path, was
roused at the five-sixteenths, tipped out after turning into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed strongly to get the lead just inside the furlong marker then
kicked clear and proved much the best under steady urging to the wire. LITTLE NUTTER was reserved off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused
outside the quarter-pole then cut the corner into the stretch, moved out while gaining outside the furlong marker, came between horses in pursuit of the
winner outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage to safely secured the place. THISMIGHTBETHEONE was taken in hand early then rated in
third position, went three wide on the turn, was asked late on that bend, chased into upper stretch, gained to make a brief bid at the furlong marker then
weakened but earned the show. SYNONYMOUS settled on the outside without cover, moved in behind horses at the nine-sixteenths, was roused in the two
path on the turn and lacked the needed response. ADELE KAT settled towards the back of the field, raced inside for most of the turn then shifted to the two
path, was asked for her best in upper stretch and failed to rally. SOUPSTER showed speed on the outside then moved clear, raced inside on the turn, was
urged along passing the five-sixteenths, came under the crop in upper stretch, led with a quickly diminishing margin into the final furlong then was collared
and gave way. MARY JANE CHROME broke a bit slow, settled at the rear of the field, went two then three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. KNOW
HOW (GB) showed speed on the inside of a foe then was taken back off the pace, switched out then tracked the pace on the outside, rounded the turn in
the two path, was asked around the five-sixteenths, chased under the crop into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
SPUNGIE was reserved under a snug hold in the two path, moved closer while still in hand on the far turn, shifted four wide inside the five-sixteenths, was
asked coming to the quarter-pole then rallied outside into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead near the three-sixteenths, kicked clear outside the
furlong marker, powered away under a solid hand ride into the final sixteenth, swapped back to her inside lead late and was kept to the task while much the
best. PANDAMOM saved ground on the first turn, tracked the pace while in hand down the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the two path, made a bid
while asked at the quarter-pole, gained a brief lead before the three-sixteenths but was quickly headed by the winner and proved no match but earned the
place. ELECTRIC YOUTH ducked in at the start then dropped back, moved out on the first turn, settled outside at the rear, was asked three wide on the far
turn, spun five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while just up for the show. EMMA AND I was bumped at the start and forced out, went
three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while saving ground on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, moved further out
under a drive outside the furlong marker and failed to rally. PURE BODE broke out and bumped with a rival, went three wide on the first turn, settled in third
position, moved closer while inside to the two path on the far turn, shifted out under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. CHASING CARA bumped
with a rival at the start, stayed out in the five path while showing speed on the opening turn, moved clear onto the backstretch, showed the way through fast
fractions, vied inside on the far turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and faded. BIG AL'S GAL was bumped at the start, took an awkward stride straightening
onto the backstretch, settled on the outside, moved closer on the final turn, was asked while three wide inside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch
under a drive and faltered.
