VORTICES inside trip, shuffled back far turn, came again between horses through the final furlong while all out to prevail in a good effort SOLAR KITTEN no
speed around first turn, rallied far turn, coming on too late. AND I KNOW speed from inside to deep stretch, grudgingly late for show. CHECK SIX raced
evenly with no late kick in the stretch run. MOMENTA KAT chased pace to far turn, gave way into the stretch readily. MYOSITIS MYSTIQUE never a factor.
SHE WANTS MORE well placed to the half, gave way fro far turn. HEAD DRESS never a menace. Race was hand timed due to timer malfunction.
