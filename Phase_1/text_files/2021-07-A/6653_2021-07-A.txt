Footnotes
BOAT'S A ROCKIN made all the pace while saving ground and was clearly best under brisk urging. LIGHT US UP settled inside then made a steady run
through the final three furlongs. SAINT MARCO advanced the rail into tight quarters behind the first flight nearing and into the far turn, angled out
approaching the lane and couldn't gain. ATTA KID was unhurried inside, began a run two wide around the final turn, angled to the outside in midstretch and
finished willingly. PRIZED MERRY pressed two wide outside the winner into the far turn then weakened. RAILMASTER wasn't far back outside early, made
a three wide run into the far turn then flattened out. MCSTEAMY was outrun. CRAZY KATER raced three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
TUFFGIRLSDONTCRY moved to a short lead from between rivals soon after the break, stayed along the rail once clear on the turn, ran out entering the
stretch and held. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) was close up between rivals early, angled to the rail on the turn, moved inside the winner inside the final
sixteenth but wasn't enough. POLISHED GAL pressed two wide outside the winner and continued gamely. EIFS raced three wide between rivals into the
turn, angled to the inside for the drive and gained too late. PRINCESS KILLMAIN was slow early, raced two wide around the turn and finished fast outside.
ORNERY ANGEL was close up outside early, raced four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. GOTTAFLATHAVEHER was wide and no factor. ZIPPY JO
broke in the air then was outrun three wide. KITTEN'S PEEBLES was close up along the inside early, steadied nearing the quarter pole and stopped. An
objection by Albright against the fourth finisher was not allowed.

BRAZILIAN BAY raced two wide between rivals, opened a short lead just after a half and held after a stiff drive. RUSSIAN MELODY broke slowly, moved
between rivals to gain a short lead just before going a furlong, stayed out from the rail while making the pace for a half and continued gamely once
displaced. STEPPING FORWARD rallied three wide to join the top two before a half, tried her best through the lane but wasn't enough. RUN THE BLUES
AWAY was close up between rivals early, fell back on the turn, swung wide into the stretch then weakened. JANE was no factor. FOXY'S EDGE was
outrun.
