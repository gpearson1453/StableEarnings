Footnotes
LOONA LUV set the pace under pressure through the turn, shook clear into the lane, was challenged nearing the eighth pole then kept on well to re-clear
late. PORKETTA was three wide through the turn when always close up, continued in the four path into the lane, moved to be a serious challenger with an
eighth to go then could not gain further and settled for second best. TIZ ABBY trailed through the turn while in the three path, straightened into the lane from
the six path and was gaining to the end. GIRLYSGOTTHELOOKS was along the inside through the turn when settling back, came into the lane from the four
path and was never a threat while moving up a couple of places. FOUND MY MAN vied for the lead two wide, began losing ground into the turn and faded
through the lane. YESTERDAYS KISSES was close up early while along the inside, continued to chase the pace into the lane and was empty.

widened to the sixteenth pole then was geared down the final sixty yards. PLEXUS was unhurried while near the inside, gained momentum into the lane and
ran down the first pacesetter for the place spot while not a threat to the in hand winner late. ROSE MARIE B set the pace while near the inside, vied with the
winner into the lane, could not keep up with that one and lost the place spot late. SPRING WAGER was never a factor while in the two or three path through
the turn. MISS HELEN BACK chased the pacesetters from the three path through the turn and into the lane then tired.

FERRYBOAT chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid three wide after mid-turn, gained the lead into the lane, cleared soon after, widened
to the eighth pole and was under intermittent urging to the wire. FIFTYFIVE STRONG raced in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane
from the four path with momentum, continued under a drive under late and settled for second best. MR. BIFFLE was along the inside through mid-turn,
came off the rail in late turn to pass a rival, entered the lane from the three path and moved up for the show spot while not a threat. ORPHAN HALLIE
stalked the pacesetter while two wide and in the three path, moved to press that one late on the backstretch, gained the lead after mid-turn then could not
go with the others after straightening in the lane. TREE GENIUSES was in the three or four path through the far turn and tired after entering the lane.
ABUELO NUNO chased the pace from the two path through the turn and was empty turning for home. BREAKERS ROAR set the pace while along the
inside into late turn, gave way entering the lane and was eased to the wire when very weary.

inside the eighth pole then edged up late. MISS INHOFE chased the pace from the two path into the turn, bid two wide in late turn, gained the lead into the
lane, was leading at the three-sixteenths pole, continued with a short advantage with an eighth to go then could not hold the winner safe while drifting out

Footnotes
DILETTANTE chased the pace while in the three path into the turn, bid three wide in late turn, continued on near even terms entering the lane, inched up to
the eighth pole then kept on well to hold the closing runner-up safe late. ROYAL COMMISSION was unhurried while in the two path into the turn, moved
further off the inside in late turn, came into the lane from the five or six path with momentum, bid from the center of the track just inside the eighth pole,
looked to be a serious threat to the top one but could not gain further while gaining the place spot late. PAT DADDY chased the pace from the two path into
the turn, bid between rivals in late turn, continued on in close proximity to the eighth pole, could not gain and lost the place spot late. BOOM FIVE
THOUSAND set the pace along the inside into the lane then gave way along the rail. HE'S NO BULL was never a factor while in the two path through the
turn. A LITTLE IRRADIC was outrun while in the three to four path through the turn.

quarter pole but was no match for the winner. OVERJOY stalked in the four path, had no late bid but gained the show late. INDIGO RICH was fractious in
the gate, hopped at the start, then had a mild late bid inside to finish on even terms with. HICKORY HIGH who led inside before giving way in the stretch.
GOT LOST stalked in the two path, then gave way in the stretch. CATCH THE SPARROW stalked the pace between foes, then faded in the stretch.
BLIGHT was not a factor. JUST DIG IT was through early inside.
