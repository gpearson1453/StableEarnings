Footnotes
DOCS SEVEN was urged to the lead and dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, dug in gamely the length of the stretch
and held to the wire. SILVER CLOUD pressed the pace between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, moved up to challenge from the two path
nearing the three eighths pole, was outkicked by the eventual winner entering the stretch and gained ground steadily down the lane while drifting out late
and just missed. SPUN D'ETAT raced off the pace on the inside early, began a bid while saving ground approaching the three eighths pole, challenged
between horses in upper stretch and weakened while drifting out in the final furlong. KHOZIE'S GHOST stalked the leader on the far outside up the
backstretch, moved up with the pack from the three and four path while racing around the turn, and faded in the stretch. GRAMERCY stumbled leaving the
gate, righted herself quickly and raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, made a mild outside gain in
upper stretch and was outkicked from there. LET'S CRUISE pressed the pace on the outside through the opening three furlongs, began to drop back while
racing in the two and three path around the turn, and continued to tire in the stretch.

Footnotes
ONE PUTT RICHIE was asked for pace inside foes, shook to the lead, set the pace while clear in the two path on the turn, opened up when driven in upper
stretch, and continued to increase his advantage while drifting out under right handed urging. TUFF ATTACK settled in second last, chased in the two to
three path on the turn, came three wide into the lane, never threatened the frontrunner under a drive, but improved well enough under a drive to prove best
of the rest. GIVIN UP NONE tracked the pace inside of TEMPER TANTRUM, hugged the rail while tracking behind the leader around the turn, was driven
inside from upper stretch, proved no match for ONE PUTT RICHIE and was outfinished for the place. DEMAND RANSOM settled at the rear, dropped
toward the inside approaching the half mile mark, was pushed along in the two path on the turn, angled out six wide in upper stretch, and lacked the needed
kick in the lane. TEMPER TANTRUM was asked for pace but outsprinted to the lead by ONE PUTT RICHIE, tracked the pace outside of GIVIN UP NONE
down the backstretch and while two wide on the turn, went to a drive approaching the quarter, proved no match for ONE PUTT RICHIE into the lane, and
came up empty between horses under a continued drive down the lane.

Footnotes
LADY ATLANTIC veered in slightly leaving the gate, settled in to stalk the leaders the on the inside up the backstretch, began a decisive bid from the three
path nearing the five sixteenths pole, kicked clear with a furlong to go and drew off from there. TIZALADYBUG hit the gate leaving it, recovered to duel for
the lead on the outside through the opening half mile, could not go with the winner in the stretch and chased that one home, the best of the rest. SHE'S A
BIG STAR hit the gate and was squeezed back at the start, bumping with the horse to her inside in the process, raced at the back of the pack on the outside
early, navigated the turn from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and made a mild gain of ground while drifting in the final furlong. MAYSTART
was pinched back and bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, trailed he field on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around
the turn and was outkicked in the stretch. VARSITY FLYGIRL chased the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the
turn in the two path and weakened between horses in the final furlong. WINNINGISFUN bobbled slightly at the break, moved up the rail to duel for the lead
up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired on the rail entering the stretch.

SLIABH AUGHTY (FR) settled in second last, continued patiently to the three eighths, responded immediately with a four and then five wide rally when
asked at the three eighths, led approaching the quarter pole, vied outside of UNEMBELLISHED in upper stretch, took command with a furlong to go, and
drew off under a drive while drifting out. DUCKDEVIL raced at the inside of the leading flight through the clubhouse turn, disputed the pace inside of
BEHAVIN MYSELF down the backstretch, carried a narrow lead over that foe into the far turn, was headed by BEHAVIN MYSELF at the seven sixteenths
but continued to attend inside through the bend and into the lane, proved no match for SLIABH AUGHTY midstretch, but kept on stubbornly to prove best of
the rest. RAG TAG chased outside of UNEMBELLISHED, ranged three wide on the leading pair past the seven sixteenths, proved no match four wide from
near the quarter pole, chased on mildly three wide in the lane and passed a tiring horse for show late. UNEMBELLISHED was bumped by RICHY in the
opening strides, tracked the leading trio while racing keenly through the clubhouse turn, continued to track the front line while racing inside of RAG TAG
down the backstretch, tracked the leading line in the two to three path on the far turn, was driven to split horses near the five sixteenths, vied inside of
SLIABH AUGHTY from near the quarter pole to midstretch, proved no match at the furlong mark and weakened between horses. BEHAVIN MYSELF
disputed the pace between horses through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, attended outside as DUCKDEVIL carried a narrow lead into the far
turn, recaptured the lead two wide near the seven sixteenths, was swallowed up while racing three wide at the five sixteenths and flattened out in the lane.
MUSICAL THEATRE settled at the rear, took slightly closer order approaching the far turn, was pushed along while saving ground around that bend and
driven inside into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. RICHY broke out and bumped UNEMBELLISHED in the opening strides, disputed the pace three
wide through the clubhouse turn, attended outside the leading pair down the backstretch, proved no match for them past the half, weakened in the four path
on the far turn and had no more in the lane.

Footnotes
COSMIC TREASURE broke quickly, and led the field while saving ground around the first turn, continued to show the way under a hold up the backstretch,
ran out slightly entering the far turn, was quickly pulled back to the rail by his rider, dueled around the far turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held the
victory under a drive. BATTLE CREEK bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the
middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the three sixteenths pole,
and chased the winner home, gaining ground to the wire. WAR LANCE saved ground around the first turn, rated behind the leader on the inside up the
backstretch and around the far turn, and gained ground mildly in the stretch, while not threatening the top two. TOWN AGENDA saved ground around the
first turn, raced off the pace up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and was outkicked on the outside from there. DICK THE BRUISER
raced in the four path around the first turn, continued off the pace up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn, gained some ground in
upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. GAGOOTS bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first
turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began his bid nearing the half mile pole, dueled from the two path around the far turn and faded in
the stretch. FRONTIER CHARLIE reared slightly leaving the gate, trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to
move up slightly from the two path around the far turn and tired entering the stretch.

Footnotes
SNIPER KITTEN set a well rated pace inside, kept on unfazed in the two path on the far turn as DANVILLE encroached, shook clear again at the top of the
stretch and held sway driving. BENELUX chased inside foes through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, chased between horses in the three
path on the far turn while relegated toward the rear, was behind traffic in upper stretch, bumped MY BARILEY, when swinging out for room, rallied belatedly
five wide inside of MY BARILEY in the final furlong, and got the nod for place. CAMMACK raced two wide toward the rear through the clubhouse turn,
continued near the rear down the backstretch, began to improve three wide on the far turn, was driven four wide in upper stretch, kept on resolutely four
wide to the wire, but lost the bob for place. MY BARILEY settled near the rear into the clubhouse turn, continued in second last down the backstretch and in
the four path on the far turn, was hard urged past the five sixteenths, swung out six wide in upper stretch, was bumped in upper stretch when BENELUX
came out on him, rallied belatedly in tandem with that foe in the final furlong, and was narrowly outkicked for place. DANVILLE tracked the pace two wide
through the clubhouse turn, continued to track nearest SNIPER KITTEN down the backstretch, was pushed along two wide on the far turn and encroached
two wide outside the leader, loomed near the quarter, but was rebuffed into the lane, kept on two wide but was outfinished in the final furlong. FRONTANA
chased two wide through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, was pushed three wide on the far turn and offered a bid outside the leading pair,
continued three wide into the lane while proving no match when SNIPER KITTEN kicked away, kept on between horses three wide but was outfinished
three wide between horses. BULLDOG OF BERGEN tracked the leader inside of DANVILLE while saving ground through the clubhouse turn, continued to
track the leading pair down the backstretch, tracked the leading flight while saving ground through the far turn, came into the lane inside while in range, and
was outfinished in the final furlong. KREWE CHIEF soon trailed, continued at the rear in the two path around the far turn, and offered no bid.

Footnotes
DIDDLEY shot to the early lead, opened up further while racing in the two path around the turn, and maintained his advantage under a drive to the wire.
TALE OF THE NILE raced outside just off the pace early, saved ground around the turn, moved into striking position nearing the quarter pole, couldn't go
with the winner and chased that one home, the best of the rest. HINTON bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, improved position on the outside in
upper stretch and finished evenly while not threatening the top two. FORT RIDGE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace
on the rail early, began to move up from the two path around the turn, and gained ground mildly between horses down the lane. CADET CAPTAIN settled
on the inside behind the pacesetter through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and weakened on the trail entering the stretch.
SATURDAYS HANGOVER dropped far back to trail the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and passed tiring horses on the inside late.
BEL BIMBO aced between horses at the back of the pack early, dropped back to trail the field from the two path around the turn and made no bid. LIBERAL
LUNACY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the four path and was not a threat. HANNITY raced
off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, moved up from the three path around the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
YALIKEANYTHING was placed on the lead inside, set the pace while saving ground through the turn, was engaged by NAVY PIER past the three eighths,
shook that foe off near the quarter pole, opened up under a drive in upper stretch and maintained his advantage under a hand ride in the final furlong. NAVY
PIER broke outward and bumped CACHACO in the opening strides, raced between horses in the tracking flight down the backstretch, ranged up three wide
into the turn, bid outside the leader in earnest past the three eighths, proved no match for him into the lane, but chased on best of the rest while going well
clear of the rest of the field in the final furlong. KING'S STORY was asked for speed, prompted the early pace outside of YALIKEANYTHING, attended the
pace between horses in the three path on the turn, proved no match for YALIKEANYTHING from near the five sixteenths, was driven inside into the lane,
could not keep pace with NAVY PIER past the furlong mark but still held the show. IRISH TUFF raced at the rear down the backstretch, was pushed along
into the turn, improved in the four path around the bend, came four wide into upper stretch, and chased on mildly past a tiring horse. CACHACO was
reluctant to load, got bumped between horses in the opening strides, recovered quickly and raced three wide in the tracking flight down the backstretch,
chased the leading line along the rail around the turn, came into the lane inside and weakened. CHOCOLATE BUNNY raced at the inside of the tracking
flight in the opening furlong, began to lose ground approaching the half mile mark, was driven in the two to three path on the turn, swung out into the lane in
the five path while still driven, and proved empty. POWERFUL MAN came inward and bumped CACHACO in the opening strides, raced in second last down
the backstretch, trailed in the four path on the turn, was driven six wide into the lane and offered no bid.
