SUSAN STRONG was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced two wide heading into the first turn, steadily edged up closer through the backstretch,
launched a bid for the leader entering the far turn, took command at the head of the lane, quickly widened to a clear advantage and finished wrapped up.
THIRSTY SISTER was forwardly placed around the first turn and into the early backstretch, vied for the lead inside STERLING MEMORIES at the half mile
marker, shook free entering the far turn, got collared by SUSAN STRONG at the head of the lane and settled for second best. STERLING MEMORY set a
pressured pace through the backstretch, could not match strides with THIRSTY SISTER entering the far turn, was ridden along two wide into the lane and
captured a share. ELLA'S MY GIRL was unhurried through early stages, was ridden along four wide into the lane and got edged out late for show. SUNDAY
CELLY rated off the early pace, urged three wide into the lane and had no response. A. P. STYLE tracked the top two leaders through the backstretch,
failed to advance under pressure around the far turn then retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
BIG MONEY MACHINE raced three wide heading into the first turn, stalked three to four wide through the backstretch, crept up closer around the far turn,
given cue two wide at the head of the lane, cleared on top past the eighth pole and held firm. JOHNNYSJOURNEY tucked in along the rail and led the way
around the first turn, set a pressured pace through the backstretch, held a slim lead around the far turn then put to a drive turning for home, fought back
when challenged by BIG MONEY MACHINE but was no match for the winner near mid-stretch. FOOLISH STEVE raced in range through early stages,
remained in close contention sitting off the top trio at the quarter pole, given cue turning for home, raced three wide under steady pressure and ran on
one-paced. ONE KING CAT prompted the pace through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid and raced in aim at the the quarter pole, could not reach
the lead then steadily weakened.

ABIGAIL'S BEAUTY grabbed the lead at the start, cleared and crossed over to the inside, set a pressured pace through the backstretch, held firm along the
rail around the far turn, roused for more turning for home, responded willingly and drew off to an easy score. BACKGATE BELLE tracked the top flight
through the backstretch, picked up the pace three wide around the far turn then sustained a steady four wide bid through the lane. MASKED MANDATE sat
outside ABIGAIL'S BEAUTY and prompted the pace through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid for command around the far turn, could not reach the
winner then flattened out in the final furlong and lost place. TAPIT BABY raced three wide in striking distance through the backstretch, failed to keep pace
midway around the far turn, lost position and had no late kick. SHE'S OUR STAR tucked in along the rail around the first turn, rated off the top flight through
the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and failed to kick on.

Footnotes
FREDONIAN was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, moved up to engage DINNER AT CRUMPLES
near the quarter pole, vied for the lead then shook clear in the upper stretch, dug in under steady pressure and held safe. HEAVY DUTY raced in range
while rated just off the early leaders, picked up the pace three wide around the far turn, angled in two wide in the upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and
nipped foe for place. DINNER AT CRUMPIES cleared and crossed over to the inside in the first turn, set the pace through the backstretch, vied for the lead
with the winner at the quarter pole, could not match strides with rival in the upper stretch, appeared all out but stayed on gamely and got nipped for place.
DREAM HALO was off slow at the start and spotted the field several lengths, raced off the pace then headed in pursuit around the far turn, was ridden along
three wide into the lane, had a mild improve but needed more for impact. POP LIFE raced off the pace and saved ground around the far turn, angled out
turning for home and lacked a needed rally. MEDITATE was allowed to settle through early stages while never too far off the early pace, launched a bid two
wide entering the far turn, briefly gained position but could not sustain bid and gave way. MEGA MAX tracked the pace through the backstretch then
weakened around the far turn.
