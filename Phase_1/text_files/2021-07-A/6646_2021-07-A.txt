Footnotes
CARNAVAL CONQUEST broke on top and was encouraged briefly to stay on the lead, relaxed on the bend, let out leaving the turn, roused upper stretch
and widened command under mostly hand urging the final furlong. LUCKYVILLE was hustled along to press CARNAVAL CONQUEST from just outside,
was no match for that one when set down for the drive but proved easily second best. FRIEND was angled out widest after the first sixteenth of a mile,
stayed well off the inside taking the bend and ran evenly the last two furlongs. STARSOVERPARADISE showed little in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
R U FORREAL was steadied when crowded by REJOICE AN BE GLAD leaving the chute, progressed from inside, was under a drive through the lane, took
over nearing the sixteenth marker and began to draw off in the waning yards. MIZ CLIPPER vied for the lead from outside from the beginning, came into the
lane from path three, moved ahead upper stretch, lacked the extra needed in the late going but was clearly second best. REJOICE AN BE GLAD angled out
some trying to gain a clear path leaving the chute, brushed with R U FORREAL, was corrected, raced in contention on the backstretch, did not keep up two
wide early in the bend, angled to the outside nearing the quarter pole, floated out to the middle of the track entering the stretch, was all out and passed tired
ones to gain third. ROCKET QUEEN disputed the pace from inside, floated out some into the lane and flattened out between rivals midstretch. SING KITTY
SING pressed the early leaders while toward the outside on the backstretch, was three wide on the bend and gave way the last two furlongs.

Footnotes
NO LETTIN GO bumped with PINCH MINE at the start, was rated just inside that one on the backstretch, let out on the bend, drew away under a drive in
the stretch and was kept to task until the final seventy yards. PINCH MINE bumped at the break, was sent to set a pressured pace between rivals, was two
wide on the turn, no match for NO LETTIN GO in the lane but was unchallenged for second. SOONER LEGACY displayed early speed from outside, was
three wide taking the bend and failed to have a significant stretch response. ROSES FOR DOUG was hustled along to be an early contender from inside but
began to fade along the rail with three furlongs to go.

SARACEN soon had the lead, showed the way in hand just off the inside, was let out on the second bend, put to a drive entering the lane, moved clear and
kept ABSTRACT PAYNTER at bay under steady handling. ABSTRACT PAYNTER hustled briefly from the gate, stayed just outside SARACEN, went for the
lead on the second turn but lacked the needed stretch kick. KAPCORI ROAD moved to the inside on the first bend, was prominent on the backstretch and
second turn but gradually yielded along the rail through the lane.

ABBMAR advanced in hand from inside to share the lead nearing the end of the first two furlongs, moved ahead when allowed on the turn, was put to urging
leaving the bend, lengthened command in the lane under while under a drive and was kept to task until the waning yards. MEETMEINSTLOUIE broke on
top and was hustled along in the early going, challenged from inside nearing the half mile marker, did not stay with ABBMAR leaving the bend and was
unchallenged for the place through the stretch. LADY CHAFFEE hesitated at the break, raced in contention from outside on the backstretch, moved to the
rail early in the bend, lacked a rally in the stretch but was easily best of the rest. NURSE KATIE pressed the early leaders but gave way from path three after
three furlongs. ANOTHER BRICKHOUSE hesitated then bore in at the start and was always well back.

Footnotes
RAHFEE TOWN showed first and was soon clear of the rest, lengthened command as allowed on the turn, received mild encouragement upper stretch, mild
urging inside the final furlong and proved much the best. PICTURE PAINTED chased from between horses, was two wide on the bend, all out in the stretch
and gained second nearing the final sixteenth. CLEVER BOY advanced from inside on the turn to take over second but gradually wore down the last
furlong. YOUJUSTGOTTUPPERED a step slow at the break, advanced from outside, was three wide taking the bend then flattened out for the drive.
MESSED UP broke a step slow and outward, soon trailed and failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
D' YANK was rated just off the early pace, went for the lead three wide on the bend, was urged leaving the turn, moved clear then continued to open up on
the rest while kept to a drive to the wire. CHICKS FOR FREE contested the pace from inside, could not stay with D' YANK upper stretch, moved clear for
second then could only hold his position under steady handling. SHELL FIRE soon trailed, lost considerable ground widest through the bend, showed a
willingness to run through the lane and gained third deep stretch. GO FOR SHERRIE three to five wide taking the turn, improved position late between rivals
without threatening. MIAS MOONBEAM was hustled up from inside after the start, raced in contention for a half mile then failed to have a significant stretch
bid. SIRCORRI in the second flight on the backstretch, stayed close just off the inside on the bend, fanned four wide into the lane and slowly yielded from
between rivals. D'ARCHER displayed early speed outside CHICKS FOR FREE for four furlongs, began to fade into the lane, angled out some upper stretch,
continued to yield, drifted out under left-handed pressure inside the last eighth, was corrected and allowed to coast the rest of the way.
