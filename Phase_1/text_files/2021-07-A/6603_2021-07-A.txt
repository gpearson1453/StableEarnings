STRIPSTEAK held on well. HONOR THE FAST MAN away well and gave a steady effort. LIGHT FOOTED broke awkwardly last, angled in through stretch
then lacked running room in the final yards. VOLEETA brushed gate leaving and bid belatedly. YOU HAVE NO EQUAL shied early stretch and weakened
late.

RUCK settled in a striking position through the backstretch, gained closer order than was given cue after the quarter pole marker and won driving. ROMAN
STEEL sprinted to the lead under restraint, held good margins leaving the backstretch but saw those margins diminish with two furlong remaining, was
unable to sustain the bid that was needed through the stretch and held on for place. GEM ALTA raced three wide leaving the opening turn, lodged a bid
nearing the five sixteenth pole, continued with interest to gain position to the end. MINSKY MOMENT saved ground inside, lodged an all out bid at the head
of the stretch and was edged out. REFLECTIONOFVALUES tracked four wide and was done early.

Footnotes
DREADNAUGHT allowed to settle early, swung out into the lane the took charge mid stretch and drove clear under a strong hand ride. RISING
REVOLUTION sat just off the pace while four to five wide, tipped four wide at the quarter pole, gained a brief advantage but proved no match when
confronted by the winner. WHODUNIT settled inside early, came under encouragement then angled out into the stretch and ran down dueling rivals. HERE
COMES BARNEY assumed command early, responded to challenge from FLAT OUT LEADER in the far turn then was overtaken into the stretch, continued
on with duel outside of the fore mentioned and was bested for show placing. FLAT OUT LEADER hurried inside then moved up leaving the backstretch to
contest the pace, dueled through the stretch and weakened in the late stages. DR A TO D sat in range while three to four wide and lacked a response when
called upon.

EVER TRUE pressed the pace from the five path, gained the advantage in the far turn and turned back the late challengers. BRIOSO tracked outside,
moved up menacingly near the three sixteenth pole, angled in mid stretch and continued with a second effort to prevail for place honors. DEVILS
COMMAND stalked the pacesetters, angled out to the three path, moved up in range but was unable to stall the winner and weakened late. REGAL CANDY
bumped leaving, trailed wide and offered a late mild bid. LONE PIONEER tracked inside, lodged a rail bid but failed to threaten in drive. VISION QUEST
vied three wide for the lead, was in tight in the first turn then checked, chased the leader and flattened. TOMAHAWK EXPLORER bumped, raced in second
flight from the three path and came up empty for drive.

Footnotes
A RING 'N A ROSE prompted the pace outside, hustled leaving the final turn, rallied four wide into the stretch and won driving. FLORIST under heavy
restraint inside throughout the backstretch, was roused at the quarter pole and was out kicked. CRAFTY ENGAGEMENT forwardly placed racing three to
four wide, engaged ROYAL STATUS nearing the quarter pole, reached the front briefly and gave way grudgingly. ROYAL STATUS quickly went to the front,
responded to challenge from CRAFTY ENGAGEMENT and weakened late stretch. IT'S ALEXUS sat in range and lacked a serious bid. DANCE SHOES
raced at the back of the pack outside and failed to reach contention. GEM OF INCEPTION tracked outside then was roused to no avail and tired.

Footnotes
GO AWAY reserved off the pace from the three path, urged between rivals at the head of the lane, was kept under steadily handling through the stretch then
found his best stride late and prevailed under a long hard drive. TROOPER JOHN tracked outside early, went in pursuit from the five sixteenth pole, gained
a slim advantage into the lane, was under steady heavy pressure through the stretch and was narrowly denied after a gutsy performance. SHARP
DRESSED BEAU saved ground while showing the way through the backstretch, saw margins diminish nearing the quarter pole, was shuffled back at the
three sixteenth pole and finished evenly. RAIL HUGGER settled outside and failed to threaten in the stretch. WHISKEY BOUND saved ground and lacked a
closing response. SHIMSHINE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
THIS TIME LUCKY contested the early pace from the rail, responded to challenge from EASTER HALO then widened through the stretch. LAST
ENDEAVOR raced in close quarters early, shifted out to the four path in the backstretch, moved up into striking range on the turn, chased hard outside but
was no match for winner. DARE TO GO settled outside in second flight early and passed tiring rival late for show. OLD DOUBLE DIAMOND sat mid pack
while three to four wide, cut the corner into the first turn and lodged a mild bid. EASTER HALO vied outside then pressed the issue nearing the quarter pole
but was unable to move on with the eventual winner and yielded in the stretch. RUDIE CAN'T FAIL sat in striking distance of the early pacesetters, chased
on rail and was unable to improve position through the stretch. AWESOME KNIGHT in tight early from the rail, had to check near the three eighths pole and
lacked a bid. WILSMAN chased outside throughout. SUNNY'S BEST never reached contention. IMPERIALITE offered little. BLAZING CHANNING chased
outside, was done early and was eased.
