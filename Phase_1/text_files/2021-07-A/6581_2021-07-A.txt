Footnotes
RUMPUS away well, showed the way early, asked along turn, shook clear into the straight, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under a steady
right handed crop. FLOWERS APRIORITY within striking distance while saving ground, continued along the rail through the turn, moved out a bit for the
drive, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. MAIRSILS FIRST in mid pack early off the inside, three wide through the turn, staged a mild rally
to annex the show, not a threat to the top three. GRACESSPECIALTOUCH within striking distance in the early going, fell back a bit through the turn, went
evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. LIBERTY DIAMOND void of speed in trailing early, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue
had been decided. BEYOND D'ORO remained back in making little impact. MISS LINDA LOU off a step slow, moved up rapidly through most of the field to
press the winner off the inside for three furlongs, got out late in the turn and gave way. SAMMY JAMMY finished early, finished well back and jogged in.

Footnotes
CAPTAINONTHEROCKS forwardly placed early, moved up to duel the middle half mile, shook off that foe when straightened for home, edged clear late.
HE'S A LUCKY MAN broke sharp, showed the way into and through the first turn along the inside, dueled with the winner the next four furlongs, could not
keep up with that one in the drive, well clear of the others. O'CONNOR broke back, lacked speed most of the way, staged a mild, belated rally to garner the
show after steered out well wide for the drive. MY LITTLE FLACO hustled away from the gate to race in a forward position through the first turn, settled in
the second flight up the backstretch, had little for the drive while off the inside. VALIANT DEFENDER one paced throughout in lacking a rally. EL WARD off
slowly, trailed well back.

Footnotes
COUNTRY DREAM floated in at the break by ELLA'S LIL STAR contributing to CHARZEE BABY and FLAT OUT BIG MONEY to be put in tight, raced
closest to the leader off the inside, collared that rival inside the furlong marker, clear late, held the runner up safe in the final strides under firm handling.
FLAT OUT BIG MONEY in tight, steadied just after the break when in tight, raced well back for a half, steered out widest for the drive, finished willingly down
the middle of the strip to be getting to the winner late. CHARZEE BABY also steadied when in tight just after the start, settled in mid pack, advanced three
wide into contention turning for home, closest to the winner late, flattened out in the final strides. HARLONS COMMISION broke out to help tighten up a
couple of outer rivals, was quickly straightened to be clear early, remained well clear through the turn, fell apart with less than a furlong remaining to lose
several positions. ELLA'S LIL STAR broke inward forcing the winner into a couple of rivals, was straightened to race forwardly in the run up the backstretch,
weakened to back up through the stretch. REALMENTE CALMADA last away, trailed throughout in showing little. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE
RIDER OF FLAT OUT BIG MONEY AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE FOLLOWING THE START, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED
TO STAND.

Footnotes
COCO'S MAN outrun early while well out in the course, moved in a bit to race in the two path far turn, caught up in traffic late in that bend, asked when clear
upper straight, split foes late, finished with good resolve up the rail and inside the late leader to gain the nod at the wire. IBEAM broke on top, cleared to the
inside nearing the wire the first time, dueled along the rail onto the backstretch, continued to alternate up front into the far turn, disposed of the other speed
turning for home, held a clear lead past the furlong marker, continued to hold the advantage late, nipped at the wire while outside the winner.
DATSWHATILIKE void of speed toward the inside, saved ground through much of the final turn, steered out for the drive, rallied late to gain the show, not a
threat to the top two. P T'S FLASH in mid pack through the first turn, moved closer before a half, within striking distance toward the rail turning for home,
briefly offered up a mild bid on the winner earning midstretch then hung the final furlong to lose the show late. CALLTHEWOLFE settled in the second flight
for six furlongs, also moved a bit closer in upper straight and flattened out as well. FIRSTTIMEVALENTINE moved up to duel outside the runner up before a
quarter, faltered when the real running began at the head of the lane. HASHTAG SPEED last away, raced back and outside, failed to muster a rally when
called on for the drive. SLOW in mid pack in the early going behind the dueling leaders, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
RIFLE MAN a bit rank at the start, raced unhurried for five furlongs, moved out and advanced three wide late in the final turn, collared the leader just inside
the furlong marker and kicked clear under steady handling. OUTOFTHISGALAXY broke on top, drew well clear through the first turn, set a modest up the
backstretch inside, continued to show the way by daylight through the final turn, offered brief resistance to the winner to begin the final furlong then could not
keep up, all out late to last for the second spot. POP LIFE devoid of early foot, moved outside and came in the four path for the drive, lodged a belated rally
outside the runner up, rapidly getting to that one in the final strides. LUCKY ANDY chased the runner up for six furlongs off the inside, had little left for the
drive. LOOKING FOR BULL finished early, trailed home to be well beaten.

Footnotes
BIG BAND'S LUCK broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, shook clear in the turn, extended that advantage under pressure past
the furlong marker, enough left late to hold off the runner up. TOTALLY ADDICTED off a step slow, raced back in lacking speed for three furlongs, worked
way to the outside for the drive, accelerated with a late burst of speed to finished up willingly, rapidly getting to the winner late while kicking clear for the
second spot. POWERSHOT broke with the leaders, raced in the second flight up the backstretch outside, moved in a bit to save some ground into the lane,
finished up evenly to gain the show, not a serious threat to the top pair. BENBOW CAT within striking distance off the inside, advanced to chase the winner
through midstretch, lacked a closing punch to finish up evenly and lose a couple of positions late. CHIEF ALPHA broke with the field, raced two out to three
wide through the turn, improved position slightly through the lane while not a serious threat. PRIMEINTERESTRATE chased the winner for three furlongs off
the rail, retreated through the stretch. WILLY MC broke back, moved up to race in mid pack, continued in that position through the turn then had little left for
the stretch run. RED MAMBA raced back off the pace toward the inside, angled out four wide for the drive, did not fire. FRENCH AVIATOR in the second
flight for three furlongs, steadily backed up in the drive. PARALISSFRMANALYSS was outrun while racing wide.

MADISON'S PLACE broke on top, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn along the inside, shook off the closest rival when
straightened for home, steadily increased advantage under intermittent pressure. MONEY INTHE STARRS raced in the second flight off the inside, came
three wide out of the turn, set down for the drive, finished willingly to be up in time for the place, not a threat to the winner. TIZ THE TIME pressed the
winner from the outside for a half, proved no match for the winner in the drive, could not contain the runner up. TIZZY'S SONG settled off the pace and the
inside, four wide exiting the turn, continued to run in even fashion through the lane in lacking a closing response. BREW CASA lacked early speed, made
little impact. IRISH PRIORITY settled in the second flight early, steady fade. PAPER DOLL bit reluctant to load, last to leave, sluggish, fell further and further
back, distanced stretch after losing contact with the field, walked off.

Footnotes
PEACOCK KITTEN unhurried out of the chute inside, continued to be outside through the first turn, moved steadily closer in the run up the backstretch while
remaining close to the inside, patiently handled through the final turn, tipped out to be four wide for the drive, outside bid, kicked clear. SHAKE SOME
ACTION in the second flight off the inside, moved closer after a half three wide, vied into the lane while remaining in the three path, narrowly showed the
way past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late, clear for the place. NATE'S ATTACK back off the pace while racing outside, one paced in
the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, four wide through that bend, rallied late to be up for the show. MAGA MAN away in good order from the
inside, showed the way out of the chute, continued to set a reasonable pace while rating the middle half, responded when confronted into the final turn, vied
into the lane still holding a slight advantage then gradually weakened when headed past the furlong marker. MCFEELY headed up the second flight early
while saving ground, fell back along the inside the middle half, continued to save ground second turn, improved into the stretch, lacked a further gain the
final furlong. BEACHCOMBING vied early outside the pacesetter, chased that one up the backstretch, rebid in the second turn, gave way in the drive.
TREYS MIDNITE MOON last to leave, trailed in the early going, remained back in failing to make an impact. TOP DRAW was finished early in falling back to
trail, no bid. GOTTA GO void of speed for five furlongs, moved closer off the inside second turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
SHADY MONKEY away well from the inside, set the pace along the inside, stayed clear past the furlong marker, enough left to hold off the runner up at the
wire. TIGARD BABES pinched back at the start, lacked early foot toward the inside as a result, in some traffic midway on the turn, steered out to be four
wide turning for home to lose some ground to the winner, finished well late to be getting to that one late. YOAKAM broke in to help pinch back the runner up,
closest to the winner while off the inside, could do little with that one in the drive, narrowly lasted for the show. UNBELIEVABLE CATCH broke out, was
straightened to race within striking distance for three furlongs, lacked a closing kick. CHELSEA'S GLORY last away, trailed most of the way in failing to
threaten. TORTUGA BAY within striking distance, steadily backed up through the stretch. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL TIME OMITTED DUE
TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.
