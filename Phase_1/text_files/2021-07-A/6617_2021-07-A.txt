stretch and drove clear. DICTATE assumed the early lead, set a reserved pace, was hustled late turn and led into the stretch but was quickly passed and
chased to hold the place. SPIDER BELLE stalked the pace three-wide on the clubhouse turn, was hustled still three-wide on the far turn and finished
gamely. NOVEMBER FOG stalked from a rail trip, was hustled into the stretch but was blocked, found a path and finished determinedly. YASINIA stalked
the pace from the second path, dropped back late on the far turn but lacked a rally. SADLERS DELITE settled off the pace, came three and four-wide
through the first turn, moved inwards from thee-wide to the second path on the far turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
DANCING DOLL was always in striking range, came two to four-wide through the turn, rallied smartly and swept by the leader in mid stretch under a driving.
EVER SO D'WILD settled off the pace, closed from the rail on the turn and finished under a determined drive. TAKE IT EASY forced the pace three-wide,
gained a short lead on the turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch but was passed a 16th out and gave chase. STARLIGHT RIDGE was taken off the early
pace and was steadied along the rail mid turn then rallied gamely. TWIRLING WIND set a pressured pace on the backstretch, was headed at the turn, rode
the rail to the stretch, rallied gamely but weakened in the late stages. MIZZONA settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but failed to
menace. AIRY FAIRY forced the pace, saved ground on the turn, failed with a bid at the top of the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
ADMIRALTY PIER showed early speed, set a reserved pace then held sway under a light drive. WEDGEWOOD settled off the pace, closed angling from
the rail to three-wide through the turn then rallied from the outside. PRIMO TOUCH raced in mid pack, saved ground, chased two-wide into the stretch,
angled out further and finished gamely. A THREAD OF BLUE stalked the pace, came three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished
under a determined drive. HONEY WON'T stalked the pace from the rail, followed the leader into the stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. BURNING
MAN settled off the pace, saved ground and finished evenly. FARAWAY KITTEN stalked the pace, came three and four-wide through the turn, chased into
the stretch but flattened out mid stretch. FRACTIONS ADDED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
DOLDER GRAND led quickly, drew away from a presser on the turn then widened through the stretch. COLLECTIVE FORCE stalked the pace, chased into
the stretch and prevailed in the battle for place. TRUFFLE KING raced in mid pack, came two and three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and
finished gamely. LOMAKI FORCE pressed the early pace, closed up and forced the issue on the backstretch, was left behind on the turn and flattened out in
the final 16th. BEAU GUEST away slowly and off the pace, was hustled along the rail on the far turn but never reached contention. NORTHERN
CONQUEST raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. PUNCH HARD settled off the pace, trailed
on the turn and finished evenly.

TWENTY FOUR MAMBA jostled with TARADAR leaving the gate, raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn, angled out and rallied outside
from the outside and had the lead a 16th out. SUMMER SUNSET dueled, drew clear upper stretch, was passed mid stretch and held place. COO BIRD was
always in range, chased three and four-wide on the turn, moved to the rail in the final 16th and finished gamely. TRAGICALLY FUNNY broke outward and
settled off the pace, closed angling four-wide late turn and closed a gap in the stretch. FIRST EMPIRE had speed, came three and four-wide through the
turn, dueled into the stretch, was quickly headed but evened out only in the final 16th. I'M A CHI TOO dueled, was headed at the top of the stretch and
flattened out in the final 16th. TARADAR, bumped at the start, raced in mid pack, was hustled on the turn, chased three-wide into the stretch but was not a
threat. SLIGHTLY FROSTED, in range, chased three and four-wide on the turn then tired a furlong out.

TOWN CRUISE led quickly, set a reserved pace then held sway under a light drive. THEREGOESJOJO ducked out at the start and bumped SPLIT MY
PANTS, settled in mid pack, closed on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. ROSE'S VISION raced in mid pack, was hustled two and
three-wide on the turn, chased gamely into the stretch evened out in the late stages. SPLIT MY PANTS steadied just out and bumped with
THEREGOESJOJO, settled off the pace, closed along the rail through the turn and was gaining through the stretch. TAOS (FR) stalked early, chased on the
turn then tired a 16th out. FULL EXTREME raced in mid pack, came two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. VIEWFINDER
settled off the pace, raced two-wide on the turn but was never in contention. DOC BOY settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but
lacked a rally. SIR SAHIB, pinched back at the start, settled off the pace, came four then three-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, but tired.

FOREST DRIFT set a reserved pace, was hustled into the stretch and was all out to hold HIDDEN IDENTITY off at the end. HIDDEN IDENTITY was
bumped by CASSIE'S RAINBOW at the start, stalked the pace, chased late turn, rallied and was gaining at the end. SILENT DIXIE stalked the pace, was
hustled two-wide on the turn and was all out in the stretch. ROCHE'S POINT stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then
closed gamely inside. CASSIE'S RAINBOW broke outward and bumped a rival, raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn but finished evenly.
TARA DAWN settled well off the pace, closed two to four-wide on the turn and was game in the stretch but never reached contention. DOWN TO EARTH
bumped with HIDDEN IDENTITY at the outset, raced in mid pack, dropped back on the turn and lacked a rally.

JOCULARITY raced in mid pack, closed into the stretch, swept to the lead a furlong out and drew away under a hand ride. LORD OF LEGENDS was
bumped by DR. JEWEL at the start, settled in mid pack, chased three to five-wide through the turn and was all out in the stretch. COLTONS DREAM stalked
the pace along the rail, was steadied in tight quarters late turn, charged into the stretch, lost his path when another horse dropped in front of him, angled out
a bit and rallied gamely. FORT HOPE forced the pace, took a short lead at the top of the stretch, was passed with a furlong to run and chased to the end.
DR. JEWEL broke outward and bumped LORD OF LEGENDS and his rider appeared to have equipment problems, possibly the reins, but settled near the
turn and closed ground but could not gain contention. WORKING THE TABLE forced the pace two-wide, bid upper stretch but was passed immediately and
flattened out. MAGIC MOUNTAIN broke inward, led into the turn, set a pressured pace, was headed upper stretch and faded.

outside rivals in the stretch but his rally stalled. READY AT DAWN raced in mid pack, came three-wide through both turns, posted a mild rally on the far turn
but leveled off at the 1/8th pole. MR SOUPERSTITIOUS settled in striking range along the two-path, dropped back in the stretch and did not menace.
