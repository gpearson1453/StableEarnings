Footnotes
PENDRELL MOON mid pack, gained position three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up
late. CORT'N ASONG mid pack, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late
kick. ORCHESTRAL stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the second turn, held that sway to the final furlong, then
weakened and held the show. GOLD HAWK mid pack, saved ground through the turn, angled widest into the stretch, then flattened out in the late going.
AWESOME HALO well placed, saved ground on the two path through the turns, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong. KICHIRO
allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path and improved position. DOUBLE RAINBOW was no factor. VINNY
BOY sent from the gate, sprinted to a clear lead, then faded through the second turn.

Footnotes
CLEARLY SMASHING broke out at the start brushing a rival, sprinted clear, increased her margin through the turn, then drew off in the stretch and was kept

the two path through the turn, came through inside of rivals and weakened the final furlong. SLURPY stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground
three wide through the turn, then ran evenly in the lane. BLUEBERRY DUDETTE allowed to settle, moved up four wide through the turn, fanned widest into
the lane and improved position. PIVOTAL WOMAN (FR) was a brief factor between rivals. THIS LITTLE KITTY was never involved. CLASSY MOMENT

Footnotes
JANGADA rated back, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room,
made a steady gain and drew off late. A COTSWOLD VILLAGE stalked the early pace on the outside, moved up to gain a striking position through the
second turn, bid outside the leader, shook clear in the stretch, then was no match for the winner and held the place safe. CHALLAH well placed and outside,
gained position three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and flattened out. VERY REPLACEABLE allowed to settle, saved ground
through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and edged up for a share. NO TIME TO YAWN tracked the pace well back, moved up two and three wide
through the second turn, bid three wide and weakened in the drive. KING OF LEINSTER (IRE) set the pace inside, stayed on when challenged into the
stretch, then faded the final furlong. KICK IT CHARLIE showed little. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR mid pack, moved up three and four wide through the second
turn, bid four wide into the lane and had no stretch rally. HOT TRAFFIC mid pacxk, faded after a half.

COMMAND STRIKE set the pace on the inside, shook clrea into the stretch, then lasted under steady pressure. REDEEM MY HEART allowed to
settle,moved up two and three wide through the turn, angled widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the place in the final strides.
FORGOTTEN PEACE well placed, gained position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and lacked the needed late kick.
REGAL CHANT tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. DARCY
MAE ran evenly for a half and had no stretch rally. LAWN DART stalked the pace on the outside, bid between rivals and had no stretch rally.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT PUNK sprinted to a clear lead quickly, increased his margin through the turn, then drew off in the lane, lugged in and lasted. MR. CAT well
placed, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and closed well for the place. WILD WINTER allowed to settle, looped up
three and four wide through the turn, fanned five and six wide into the lane and edged up for the show. DONALD well placed, held position three wide
through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and was outfinished for the show. ALASAAL well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the
turn, bid outside the leader into the lane and weakened the final furlong. ANOTHER SOFTBALL mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn,
came through inside of rivals into the stretch and evened out. BLUE SKY'S ABOVE ran evenly. INDIAN TANGO improved position. ARCH REVENGE
showed little. BREZNO showed little. GOLDEN EMPEROR rated inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals and had no stretch
rally. LOVE SICK KITTEN fractious in the gate, hooped at the start and was no factor.
