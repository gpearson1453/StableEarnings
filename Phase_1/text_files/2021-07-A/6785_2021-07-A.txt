back, offered a mild bid inside and earned place while no match for the winner. RUN FOREVER set the pace while racing in hand, fell back on the turn,
angled out and leveled off in the drive. INDY'S OUTLAW pressed the pace along the inside, angled out on the turn, swung wide and weakened in the drive.
MISS SHAWHAN raced close to the pace outside, rallied on the turn to loom a threat and gave way. PEPPERS ACE pressed the pace, was through after a
half and dropped back. ANALYZE HER STYLE lacked a response in a wide trip. Hand timed.

Footnotes
AUTISM WARRIOR set a pressured pace to the turn, drew away for a clear lead and held under urging. WRITE ITINTHE DUST raced in the back, closed
willingly inside and was gaining ground. TW SKIPPING STONES pressed the pace while racing inside, fell back on the turn, angled out and hung late.
BOURBON AND WATER pressed the pace to the turn, fell back and finished evenly. TIZTRUCULENT lacked a bid in an even effort. DANNY'S BIG BOY
broke slowly, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. SILVERS BLING broke in, showed brief speed and was not urged through the stretch. The fractional
split of 4504 was removed. Hand timed.

Footnotes
TICO TIME bumped at the start, pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to the sixteenth pole and drew off. MERRY MARIE was
hustled along to set a pressured pace, responded to duel and yielded near the sixteenth pole. HAYNESPUN raced close to the pace inside, angled out for
the drive and lacked the needed late response. RANDOM PLEASURE was void of early speed, saved ground and lacked a bid. LAYLA'S WILDCAT
pressed the pace while racing outside and gave way on the turn. OYE COMO VA bumped at the start, pressed the pace to the turn and gave way. GOLDEN
GODDESS raced wide and lacked a response. REDHAWK pressed the pace while racing between horses, was checked into the turn and stopped. The
fractional split of 4548 was removed. Hand timed.

CATS TOUCH was sent to the front to set the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, closed steadily and drew clear late. BRICKBAT bumped at the start, went
five wide along the backstretch, advanced on the turn, bid to contend and didn't have enough late. CHECK AND RAISE rallied into the turn, was carried out
entering the stretch, finished well and was gaining late. THETRAILERGUY broke in and bumped at the start, pressed the pace inside, fell back on the turn,
bid and hung. PLEASE DO TELL pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, was carried out entering the stretch and gave way. INCLUDE HOO
saved ground and was not a factor. VICTORY LANE raced close to the pace, was through after a half and gave way. Hand timed.

Footnotes
BOOGIE TWO SHOES settled off the pace while racing inside, angled out on the turn, assumed command and drew off in the drive under mild urging.
JAZZY EINSTEIN was void of early speed, found her best stride late and got up for place. SILLY NOTION was slow early, finished well and earned show.
CHEROKEE PAPOOSE failed to threaten in an even effort. RIVER JUMPER set the pace to the turn, dropped back and faded through the stretch. PALACE
STAR was not a factor. UH OH LUCY was away alertly, showed speed to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. Hand timed.

Footnotes
GAMBLERS GOLD RUSH set a pressured pace, swung out leaving the turn, dueled through the stretch and proved best in a long drive. A NEW TREND
pressed the pace, was carried out leaving the turn, went willingly to the wire and got up late for place. SON OF ELEANOR pressed the pace while racing
inside, challenged for the lead leaving the turn, dueled to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. PRIVATE JOKE raced mid pack, lacked the needed rally and
failed to menace. SUM CANDY was not a factor. BAJA BRIDGE was outrun. BLOWIN SMOKE passed a tiring rival. WINDI'S MOMENT showed speed to
the turn and stopped. Hand timed.
