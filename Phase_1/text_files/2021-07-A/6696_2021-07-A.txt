stretch and held on late. MISTS OF TIME was off slowly, then advanced five wide on the turn, then closed well on the outside to just miss. KRIS' WILD KAT
was allowed to settle early on the inside, then angled out in upper stretch for racing room to make a bid, was gaining but was shut off in deep stretch losing
all chance. LUCKY BREAK set a pressured pace and dueled for the lead on the inside then weakened in the drive. TRIPPLE SHAKE pressed the early
pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command but weakened in the drive. COUNTRY LOVE was well placed early on the inside, then
