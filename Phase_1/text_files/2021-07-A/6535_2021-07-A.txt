Footnotes
CALL WEST inside trip under heavy pressure up the rail to be along in time under stout handling. IMPROBABLE STORY chased off rail, mid track rally
while all out rally to just miss on the wire. SUMMERDUCK raced between horses throughout, short late lead, popped head in front but run down late.
HERE'S CARLOS awkward start, between horses to turn, mildly in the late going. HUGH B. speed to the stretch, weakened from between horses late. GET
TOUGH always trailed. RACE WAS HAND TIMED. THERE IS A TIMER MALFUNCTION AND THE FINAL TIME WILL BE THE ONLY FRACTION LISTED
THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE CARD.

ANCIENT BROWN floated out first turn, perfect position to far turn, ran off in full command. GUILDER set quickly to the front over taken in the stretch,
bested rest. CLASS RIOT raced evenly inside most the way with no excuse in the stretch. OXBOW'S RUBY between horses, into first turn, far back in a
drive, improved. CATTALEYA RONITH chased winner to the half, surrendered from that point. SEQUAYA never a factor. SUNDAY EXPRESS dropped
back quickly.

Footnotes
NATALIES CHARM raced widest first turn, gunned to the lead, cleared and was all out to hold on. TELLER TO SING lost momentum into far turn, angled
out to make a late run coming on too late while probably best today. EASY SILENCE well placed, never far back to far turn ducked in sharply at the three
sixteenth pole and continued on for the show spot. BIRRA was off slow rushed to be well placed while inside throughout, no late kick in the lane. LATE FOR
TAPS pressed on lead, stumbled badly into the stretch, stopped. KHOZYS CROWN broke sharp, between horses first turn, gave way quickly. CLASSIC
TALE SAVER through early, backed up readily. OUT OF POCKET dropped far back. The seven furlong time was incorrect and omitted from the chart.

Footnotes
TWO MORE TIMES no speed to the half, came with a furious run past the quarter pole to be along in time. CRUZIN TATUM rushed between horses, good
position to the stretch but was outfinished. GRANITE CANDY speed to the front, stayed clear to eighth pole but also outfinished in the late stages. MISS
APPLE PIE reluctant to load, raced outside to far turn and only improved position through the stretch. TREES THUNDER chased from outside gave way in
final sixteenth. EQUALLY EVEN reluctant to load and never a factor. MOMMA CRIBBED never a factor. MIRIANA'S QUEEN flashed brief speed to the half,
gave way readily. STORYBOOK FARM gave way quickly. There was a timer malfunction thus the final time was only posted.

EASY DOER hustled along inside, tracked leader, took over past the half, cleared off and held on at the wire. FATHER DENNIS good position, came on
from quarter pole but too late held the placed. TUF INTENSITY had a troubled start, recovered with a steady gain, split horses and just missed place spot.
COME ON VENEZUELA speed to the half, stayed on inside but weakened in the drive. HONDO GUSTO raced evenly, never untracked and leveled off in
the drive. CHRISTIANS CITY had a steady fade. CROWN TO THE GOLD always trailed.
