pace bidding boldly along the inside in upper stretch pressing the winner to the wire. SALTY SNAPPER chased the pace pressing in bid on the turn,
extending from mid track down the lane would finish evenly. BLIND JUSTICE slow early raced mid track down the lane outbidding the others. MOON LINK

Footnotes
CATES SWOOSH bid three deep on the turn wresting a clear lead in upper stretch drawing out under urging. SEVEN IRON pressed the pace dueling from
the rail to upper stretch proving no match late hanging on for place. ANYWHERE ROAD a step slow through the turn raced five wide to upper stretch
rallying late near mid track. TICKET TO ALASKA raced evenly throughout besting the others. BARN YARD BRAT pressed the pace dueling between horses
on the turn weakening in upper stretch. JOHNNY CASINO slow early played no factor. VINNYVINVINCENT was always outrun. BRANANX faded on the
turn.
