Footnotes
VANA GRAND set the pace, had a slim lead on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. PRINCESS MORO was
unhurried early, hustled along on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for place. TWOMANYSHOTS was off the pace and
moved up on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. NAKED ILLUSION tracked the early leader and was a factor on the far
turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch evened out. STARDUST KITTEN was in touch and saved ground on the far turn but was no real threat.
WILBURNRUBBER was in range but chased on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. WHAT'S IN A KISS (IRE) was well
back and showed nothing in a dull effort.

Footnotes
CANELITA was away alertly, had a clear lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. SHANGHAI KIMMY was hustled early
and a factor on the turn but from the five path through the stretch was no match for the winner. RI N GINGER was off the pace, roused on the turn and from
the three path at the top of the stretch was up for show. PETAL was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had
no late kick. SMOKEHOUSE was in touch but chased on the turn and was never a threat. MYSTERY DAY broke poorly and showed nothing in a dull effort.

Footnotes
TARA EMPIRE was unhurried early, moved up on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch rallied in time. EASY ACCESS showed speed and
set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. RHYTHMIC stalked the early leaders and was
roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. MIDSUMMER BIRD was hustled early and raced evenly on the turn but from
the five path at the top of the stretch was all out. HIDEY HIDEY was away alertly and hustled along on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the
stretch had no rally. WICKEN CENTS was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. TOURIST ATTRACTION had no speed, showed
little and was never in contention.

GROUNDHOG DAY was away alertly, a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. SAVVY LAYLA showed
speed from the inside, had the lead on the turn and vied from the three path at the top of the stretch but was outgunned. EMPTY TALK was in range and
roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. CAPE ROMANCE was unhurried early and gained ground on the turn but
leveled off in mid stretch. CAPTAIN SIDNEY was up close and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no late kick.
BEXAR set a pressured pace but chased on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. MY MARC ANDRE was well back,
trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes. LEONARD'S BAY was off the pace, showed little and was never involved. TACKLE THE NORTH was in
touch but lost ground on the turn and was empty.
