AWESOME IMAGE sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, increased his advantage into the lane and held MIRROR
IMAGE safely to the wire. MIRROR IMAGE broke sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide, could not reach that foe in the drive but finished
willingly. COUGAR COUNTRY chased the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to gain in the drive. AZADI lacked early speed, raced three-wide
through the turn and did not threaten. DYNAMITE LAD lagged early, saved ground through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. GRAND AIR bobbled at
the break, was forwardly placed when straightened away, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.

POINT HOPE (IRE) sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off with complete authority. SUDDENLY AWESOME
was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but held on well to save the place. FULL
SPEED AHEAD was never far back while racing along the inside and finished willingly in the drive. WHATA FLIRT broke out, chased the leaders while
racing three-wide and weakened through the final furlong. CLUB ROYALE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
MAYBEE A DIVA checked soon after the start and lagged throughout.

TALKING EYES settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run, vied with DISCREET
DEMONS and edged away from that rival through the closing yards. DISCREET DEMONS was bumped at the seven-eighths marker, stalked the leaders
while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead with a quarter to run, responded when
challenged by the winner in mid-stretch, vied with that rival but could not match strides through the final yards. COASTAL AFFAIR lugged out to bump rival
through the first turn, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the quarter and finished with good courage.
XIMENA'S HONOR was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened. CASTIELA BLAZE chased the leaders from between foes and
weakened after going a half. PULPIT LINE was off a step slow and did not reach contention. HELEN FIRE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while
setting the pace, drifted out nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and weakened.

SHOW LO was bumped at the start, raced unhurried early, altered course nearing the quarter and finished with good late energy. ABRAA JABRAA lacked
early foot, saved ground through the turn and finished evenly late. PERFECT BLOSSOM showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the turn and
weakened. KISSABLE U was bumped at the break then forwardly placed from between foes, moved five-wide through the tureen and weakened.

Footnotes
MISS MONIQUE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, checked nearing the quarter, remained inside for the drive, reached the fore with a
furlong to run and drew off. THAT'S MY STORY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and
finished with a steady rally. BOTTLE NECK lacked early speed, steadied nearing the three-eighths marker, saved ground through the turn and finished with
a late bid. FINISHED MY P H D pressed the pace while racing three-wide and gradually gave way in the drive. SHE'S SMART ENOUGH chased the leaders
while racing four-wide and gave way after going three furlongs. MADIGAN SQUEEZE was away in good order to set a pressured pace and weakened after
going a half. DANCE FIGHTER broke out, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and failed to rally.
UNLIMITEDDATAPLAN showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace.

LOLO PANIOLO was reserved just off the pacesetters early, advanced four-wide through the second turn, responded to steady urging and was up in the
closing yards. SWAMP SOUFFLE was bumped at the break, lagged early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch,
rallied late and just missed. ADENS DREAM sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and gave
way grudgingly late. RATE FOR ME lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. ALL AMERICAN HERO chased
the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. NORSKI was bumped at the start, settled off the leaders from the inside and
gradually weakened. ONCE ON WHISKEY raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not

Footnotes
FREIBURG was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid in tandem with DOCTOR BRUCE S with a furlong to
run, vied with that rival through a vigorous drive and proved best. DOCTOR BRUCE S. raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out into
the stretch, reached the fore along with the winner in mid-stretch, vied and just missed. MORE HONOR was off a step slow then allowed to settle, raced
four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with some late run. SOVEREIGN NATION pressed the pace while racing
three-wide for a half and gave way. OWNERS' PRESTIGE (AUS) broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the final
furlong. DANGERSMYMIDDLNAME lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a factor. TCHULA SUNSET was void of early speed,
raced four-wide through the turn and failed to menace.
