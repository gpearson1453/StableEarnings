came up empty late. MATSON pressed the pace while racing outside, fell back to stalk, tired on the turn and gave way. RUN FOREVER vied between

BOLD REY set the pace, responded when challenged to duel in tight quarters through the stretch and proved best in a long drive. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY
was unhurried early, saved ground, moved up inside to challenge on the turn, dueled in tight quarters through the stretch and was outfinished in a game
effort. GREATER GLORY was unhurried early, advanced around the turn, offered a mild bid mid track and was along for show while no threat to the top two.
PRINCESS TALE improved position in an even effort. SHOE GAME raced close to the pace, rallied four across into the turn to loom a threat, tired and gave
way. SUPAH SISTA was never far back, bid between horses into the turn, tired and gave way. MY EXPRESSION pressed the pace, rallied between horses
into the second turn, tired and stopped. Hand timed.

OUT FOR JUSTICE challenged for the lead on the turn, drew clear mid stretch and held safely while kept to task. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT bumped at the start,
advanced inside, shifted out for the drive, closed steadily, didn't have enough late and finished second best. THE KOHEN was never far back, lacked the
needed late response and held safely for show. STONE CREEK sprinted clear, responded when challenged to duel, weakened in the drive and faded. LIL
LATIGO was hustled along early, lacked a bid and was outrun. MI MALDITO AMOR bumped at the start and failed to respond. DON'S FINAL FINAL trailed
in a wide trip. The fraction of 56.75 was removed. Hand timed.

PUT YOUR PANTS ON dueled to mid stretch and drew off. KING PARKER was void of early speed, finished well inside and got up late for place. OIL
dueled to mid stretch, was unable to sustain his bid and was caught for second. LODE THE GOLD showed good early speed, fell back, stayed within range
and lacked the needed late rally. BOTERO raced mid pack in an even effort and failed to threaten. NEVADAN was not a factor. TIZ WAY COOL advanced
inside, had nothing left for the drive and gave way. MASTER RULER showed speed to the turn and stopped.Hand timed.

DELIGHTFUL HIPS vied to the turn, drew clear and held under urging. NOT THAT I RECALL saved ground, angled out for the drive, closed steadily and
gained late. MADISON'S QUARTERS vied to the turn, fell back, hung late and held safely for show. DRAFTY BREEZE rallied four across on the turn, was
carried out, fell back and leveled off. SALSA VERDE passed tiring rivals. ARIES rallied between horses on the turn to loom a threat, swung wide and
dropped back. TILLTHELUVRUNSOUT lacked a response and failed to contend. Hand timed.

Footnotes
RUN FOR BELLE stalked the pace, went four wide entering the stretch, closed willingly and inched clear in a driving finish. ADRIENNE'S PROGENY was
taken back on the turn, angled in, split horses in the upper stretch, bid gamely and was outclosed. OLD WEST raced close to the pace inside, bid between
horses on the turn, dueled for the lead, yielded and held for show. EZ QUEEN stalked the pace, went five wide entering the stretch and lacked a rally.
TAHOE BLUE set the pace to the turn, weakened in the drive and fell back. BONITA BALLARD failed to threaten in an even effort. GAMER BABZ was not a
factor. MAGIC HUSSAR showed little. The rider of TAHOE BLUE claimed foul against the rider of ADRIENNE'S PROGENY for alleged interference in the
stretch drive. No change was made. Hand timed.
