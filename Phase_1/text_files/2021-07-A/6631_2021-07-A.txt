Footnotes
NO KA OI raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid four wide down the lane, under a long drive in the final sixteenth and edged
past in the late stages. WHEN'S TEE TIME was in tight into the first turn, raced in the five path along the first turn, was in the three path into the lane, took
over near the eighth pole, was under a long drive and yielded late in the drive. TURBULENT SKY raced in the six path along the first turn, was in the five
path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. SYMBOL AZTECA broke out at the start and trailed the field early on, was off the rail into the lane,
altered out nearing the eighth pole with a late gain in the final stages. UNSPOKEN MEMORIES tracked the pace, raced in the three path along the first turn,
was in the four path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but hung in the late stages. TEXAS STORM set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane
and faltered late in the stretch drive. DAVID'S GRACE chased the pace early, raced in the six path along the first turn, was on the inside into the lane and
weakened late in the stretch. TOUCH OF GOLD raced in the four path along the first turn, was in the six path into the lane while no threat. GINA'S
BROTHER was never a factor. DUKE OF ARGYLE was never involved. RHETTROACTIVE was in tight into the first turn and done early.

TWO MIKES N DOC G trailed the field early on, was in the five path into the lane, rallied, drove past five wide and cleared the field in the final stages.
TENSAS TODDY stalked the pace early, raced in the two path along the first turn, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch and was up
for place in the final stages. END ZONE chased the pace early, raced on the inside along the turns, made a bid in the stretch but did not have enough for
place in the final stages. KING ZIPPY tracked the pace early, raced in the four path along the first turn and into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but hung
in the late stages. NETELA was bumped at the start, set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. MOSTA FLYIN
raced in the four path along the turns while no real threat. ZENS SECRET was bumped at the start, pressed the pace early, raced in the three path along
the first turn and into the lane then faded late in the stretch drive. BAD BOY JOHNNY was never a factor.
