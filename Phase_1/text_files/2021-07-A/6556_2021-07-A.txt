through the lane while clearly best of the others. CHIEF TY HE followed the pace three wide and had no rally. THUNDERSTORMACOMIN was not a factor.

MAYHAWK followed the early leaders while saving ground, moved three wide to bid through the far turn, rallied outside then was packed out deep stretch
and was just up at the wire. GREEN CARD forced the early pace outside FERRARI ROAD to bid into the far turn, edged clear then bore out through the
final sixteenth to brush and carry the winner out to just miss. BLUEGALE settled back off the early pace four wide and made a mild late run to gain the
show. AFFIX moved three wide to close the gap through the far turn then missed the show late. NOW MIND YOU saved ground to the far turn, angled five
wide nearing the lane and could not threaten. FERRARI ROAD was on the early lead inside and tired.

WILDFIRE SIS showed the most early speed to open a clear lead through the first turn racing about the three path, continued to lead by daylight into the
lane then held safe late. SWEET COWGIRL was along the inside early, angled out into the far turn and slowly closed through the lane but could not run
down the winner. STREAKNSILVERSTONE was angled out going up the backstretch, rallied five wide through the far turn and continued to close but was
too late. TEA AT NOON moved three wide into the lane and made a mild late run. MISS JUSTICE saved ground in reach of the pace but lacked a final
closing run. TAPITY TAP followed the early pace three or four wide and tired. JUST SEND HER was not a threat four wide.

heels in traffic and checked in the first turn, remained in reach three wide and could not produce the needed late run. DONNAS FINAL WORD was on the

Footnotes
FIRE TWO POINT O prompted the early pace four wide outside rivals, bid through the far turn and surged clear in the lane. STASH THE CASH rallied four
wide in the far turn and gained the place but could not get to the winner. NEXTPORTOFCALL moved up between rivals to bid into the far turn, gained the
inside through that bend and came up empty in the drive. FORGERY vied between rivals and could not produce a late run. SOONER THAN SOONER was
five wide in the first turn, remained outside and failed to rally. EVERYDAYISAGOODDAY was along the inside and failed to threaten. HI HEAT BOY stalked
the pace four to five wide and failed to mount a bid. DOUBLE ONE SHOT was on the pace along the inside early and weakened.
