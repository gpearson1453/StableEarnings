Footnotes
FLAG SALUTE broke sharply and set the fractions through the turn while two wide, extended the lead off of the turn and was pressured in the final sixteenth
by the runner-up but gamely held on to prevail. RUNNING LUCK prompted the pace by the winner though the turn while three wide, made a late gain in the
final sixteenth on the winner and was pressuring him late but could not close the gap while an easy second over the rest. SASSY EINSTEIN settled at the
rear of the field through the early going while four then five wide on the turn but weakened in the stretch drive. SHARP CURVE stalked the pace through the
turn while four wide and faded in the stretch run. RAY RAY IS GONE chased the early pace, was outrun on the turn while on the inside and gave out in the
stretch drive.

AMBER LOUISE sat just off of the early pace, gained ground on the turn while four wide, continued that bid into the stretch to wear down LADY CHROME
and held off the runner-up in the final stages. TROUBLE N PARADISE settled in the early going while two wide on the turn, mounted a rally in the stretch
and pressured the winner late but just missed for the win while holding for second. LADY CHROME was sent to set the pace, was two wide on the turn, was
confronted by the winner inside of the furlong marker and was tiring in the late going but just missed for second while holding for third.
JENPIRESTRIKESBACK settled toward the rear of the field while saving ground on the turn, made a bid in the stretch but was outfinished. BOUNTY OF
GOLD stalked the pace while three wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch run.

OUR EXPECTATION sat just off of the pace through the turn while saving ground, made a steady bid coming off of the turn to cut the corner and confront
TED, dueled with that one inside of the final furlong and prevailed in the final jumps. TED dueled on the front end through the turn while three wide, was
confronted by OUR EXPECTATION and dueled through the length of the stretch but could not hold that one off while a clear second over the rest. MAGIC
TIGER settled toward the back of the field, was four wide on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. EL CHARRO CHAMP contested the early pace
with TED, was two wide on the turn when starting to lose ground and weakened in the stretch drive.

DON'TTEASETHETIGER set the pace through the second turn while rating nicely, extended the lead off of the turn and was coming back to the field in the
end but was clear at the finish. UPO settled toward the rear of the field, was four wide on the second turn and mounted a rally in the stretch to cut into the
winner's margin but was not pressuring him in the end. STONE GROOVE stalked the pace through the second turn, was three then four wide on that turn
and weakened in the stretch run. UBER STAR chased the winner through the second turn and gave out in the stretch run. HAWK'S RISING was unhurried
in the early stages, was two wide on the second turn while being outrun and was not a factor.

CROWN AND PICKLES sat just off of the early leaders, was four wide on the turn, slipped to the inside for the stretch drive while rallying and got up in the
final stages to prevail. AMITY HARBOR stalked the pacesetter through the turn while three wide, gained ground in the final furlong but was bested by the
winner in the final stages. COUSIN EDDIE was hustled to set the pace through the turn while two wide, extended the lead off of the turn but was tiring and
caught by the top two while holding third. SHOTGUN RIDER settled toward the back of the field, was three wide on the turn and made a mild late rally in the
stretch. PREACHER BROWN sat just off of the early pace, was four wide on the turn and did not offer a bid in the stretch. ROBIE settled in the midflight
while five wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch. OMAHA RUTSCH was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground on the turn and was not a
factor.

Footnotes
LEADVILLE settled in the early stages, gained ground on the turn while five wide, continued that bid into the stretch to pass rivals and edged clear in the
end. PEQUENO MONTE chased the pacesetters from toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the turn while gaining ground but finished evenly in the
stretch, while besting the rest in a blanket finish. MINOSO contested the early pace from a two wide position on the turn, led into the stretch and was caught
by the winner but held for third. ZERO BUCKS GIVEN dueled for pace duties through the turn while three wide and was outfinished in the stretch run.
KATZUMOTO was unhurried in the early going, gained ground along the turn but flattened out in the stretch run. ICE OR FIRE bobbled at the start, chased
the pacesetters through the turn while two wide and did not rally in the stretch drive. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET broke on top and contested the early pace,
was four wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch run.
