Footnotes
PEARLY QUEEN rated a short lead inside, kept the edge over DEVILISH BEAUTY through the far turn, came under pressure into the stretch and widened
with steady handling, while the latter, angled in to stalk from the three path, challenged nearing the three eighths pole and continued in the three path of the
far turn, bore out approaching the head of the lane, though, dug in when straightened away to duel for second. ORTINOLA settled just off the early pace
about the three path, picked up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn still in the three path then outfinished in the
stretch duel for second. WHOSE THAT LADY entered the opening turn about the five path then angled to the inside past the nine sixteenths pole, picked up
the chase leaving the three eighths, eased out toward the head of the lane but showed little more. WATERLOO ROSE stalked the earlier pace off the rail,
challenged toward the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. INFINITE REWARD raced in the five path the first turn and entered the
backstretch outside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, drifted into the stretch and weakened. JEAN GREY
rounded the first turn in the four path and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
BULLY DANCER saved ground through the opening turn then bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, progressed steadily near the rail on the far turn,
eased out a furlong away and dug in to take over the final yards. RUNAWAY CROWN took the lead approaching the three quarter pole and angled in to rate
the pace, was met leaving the nine sixteenths pole and gave up the lead to Dusky, recovered the advantage approaching the three eighths and widened on
the far turn, was steadily encouraged from the head of the lane but was caught in the final yards. CHAMPTOWN HOPE raced well off the pace in the four
path the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, then dueled for third inside the eighth pole.
BLOKE rated close off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn still just off the rail then flattened
stride. MASTER OF DISASTER saved ground through the first turn, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, weakened in the five path of the far turn then
drifted into the stretch. DUSKY angled in through the front stretch and stalked two deep on the first turn, moved to the lead past the nine sixteenths pole, but
was caught toward the three eighths, dropped back at the five sixteenths and faded on the far turn. DOM GOOD raced well back and showed little response.
SECRET ROI rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase from the three eighths pole then weakened in the five path of the far turn. SUN AND SALT

Footnotes
SKI BUNNY stalked two deep then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead at the five sixteenths, drew clear midway on the far turn, was
steadily handled to widen through the upper stretch then taken in hand past the sixteenth pole. POLISHED COPPER saved early ground, bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole and improved in the three path of the far turn, then dug in to take second the final yards. MAE SAI PRINCESS rated a slim lead
inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and gave up the lead at the five sixteenths, dropped back midway on the far turn then
flattened the final sixteenth. STATED saved ground the opening turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and improved in the five path of the far
turn, then passed rivals in the final sixteenth. CASTLEINTHEMEADOW rounded the opening turn off the rail, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole,
raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened. SAILING ROCK raced in the four path the first turn, was well off the pace into the backstretch and showed
little response. CATTY KRYS was never a factor. ONEPRETTYTHING angled in through the front stretch and stalked three wide the first turn, picked up the
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the three path of the far turn. FLOATING BY saved ground racing well back, eased out into the
backstretch and showed little response.

Footnotes
MIO GRACELAND angled in to contest the pace and took a slim lead approaching the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear past the quarter and was steadily
encouraged through the lane. THUNDERINREADYRICK chased off the rail then checked in tight approaching the quarter pole, eased to the four path
through the turn, dueled for second mid-stretch and finished well. SO COURAGEOUS was hustled along about the three path while contesting the pace,
had his heels clipped nearing the quarter pole, dropped back at the rail past the pole then flattened stride the final furlong. CATFISH settled off the earlier
pace just off the rail then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, eased to the seven path to get around Champster on the turn but showed little further
in the lane. SALTY J J chased, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened in the lane. WARRIOR'S ESTATE chased toward the outside and had his heels
clipped while in the six path past the quarter pole, steadied at the heels of Juba Junior a furlong out and weakened. WEAVINTHEBLOCKS gave chase
through the backstretch and rounded the turn widest. WILD RUN gave chase though never factored. CHAMPSTER chased through the backstretch,
steadied from between horses nearing the quarter pole, clipped the heels of Warrior's Estate past the pole and nearly lost his rider, then showed nothing
further. JUBA JUNIOR was hustled close in early chase, checked at the rail and clipped the heels of So Courageous nearing the quarter pole and lost his
rider. After posting the inquiry, the Stewards disqualified So Courageous to last place for alleged interference nearing the quarter pole, which caused Juba
Junior to clip heels and lose his rider.

Footnotes
SPUNMAN rated close inside then challenged toward the three eighths pole, took over approaching the five sixteenths, raced clear midway on the far turn
and was steadily handled to widen. LUFTY'S KISSES raced off the pace about the three path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and
rounded the far turn near the rail, though, had to settle for second best. NAZCA MYSTERY closed to the front and angled in to rate the pace, came under
pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail approaching the five sixteenths, dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened stride.
BOP MARLEY ssettled back off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and improved his position in the six path of the far turn, but
showed little more. FANCY CASTLE stalked the earlier pace about the three path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole then flattened out in
the four path of the far turn. RIDING CLOUD NINE rounded the opening turn about the five path, raced outside into the backstretch and gave chase toward
the three eighths pole, but showed little response. ANY WAY NOW settled off the pace about the four path the first turn and showed little response through
the backstretch.

Footnotes
KATALIMA rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced off
the rail on the far turn, dug in for the lead later yards and ran clear toward the wire. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE angled to the inside and rated the pace, came
under pressure past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, was steadily encouraged through the lane, gave up the lead later yards and
just lasted in second. NAJWA ran in the three path the first turn then checked lacking room into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, finished well and just missed second. GATTOLOTTACHARM stalked off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the
five sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and passed a rival in an even finish. YOU'RE DOING FINE stalked from the three path, picked up
the chase at the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then weakened. QUINCYS WAY raced well back off the rail the first turn and showed
little response through the backstretch. CHOPRA rated close inside the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened into the far turn.
PARTLY DANDY dropped well back.

Footnotes
MERCHANT OF HOPE took the lead while angling in nearing the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, increased her lead at the rail on the turn,
was steadily handled in the upper stretch then allowed to relax the final sixteenth. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW gave chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail,
proved no match for the winner, though, held on for second. SENSE OF MUSIC stumbled leaving the gate and settled well back from early contention,
started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced in the six path of the turn and steadily closed to take third the final yards. BASKET GIRL chased through
the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, angled to the four path into the stretch and finished evenly. LAVELLO gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail
then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. BELLA FEMMINA stumbled leaving the gate then gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little
further. BAYOU BOUGIE gave chase and saved ground on the turn. LIL LINDER was not a factor. DAMISELA engaged in close early chase but faded in the
four path of the turn. KAROL G came away sharply and chased outside, but was taken back widest on the turn then eased in the lane.
