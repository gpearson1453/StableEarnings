MULA OMEGA set a pressured pace on the inside, shook off that rival then dug in gamely in the stretch to hold off WHISKEY OVER ICE late under a drive.
WHISKEY OVER ICE stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid entering the stretch, but hung late to just miss. GOLIATH RIDGE was well placed on
the inside, then was boxed passed the three sixteenths pole, then steadied by the furlong marker, then had a belated rally on the inside to get the show.
SOLAR CITY pressed the pace three wide faded while losing the show award late, needed more. CLEAR ADVANTAGE was four wide into the first turn,
then chased the pace four wide and faded. RUNNIN THE RED was taken back early then passed the tiring rivals. PAPA MOLLY chased the early pace on
the inside and weakened. MORO LEGEND failed to menace. MORO SAVAGE showed little.

Footnotes
MISS PERFECTA was rated along the inside to leaving the far turn, then angled out for racing room, then was sent down to close well getting up late to
prove best under a drive. BOERNE vied for the early lead on the inside, then made a inside move leaving the turn to draw clear by the furlong marker, but
was caught late in a good effort. CORLUNA was off slowly, then advanced on the inside on the far turn to move into contention, then lacked the needed rally
in the stretch while getting up for the show. ZARELDA was allowed to settle early, then went up to track the pace three wide on the backstretch, came four
wide into the drive but offered no rally. HERBS LOVE chased the pace four wide on the backstretch and weakened. DISCREET SMILE vied for the early
lead three wide, then went up to set the pace two wide by the half mile marker and gave way in the drive. KITTY'S QUEEN lacked a rally. SET THE PACE
steadied before the first turn, then got out badly on the first turn and was distanced.THE FIRST QUARTER SPLIT WAS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
KENAI BOB was with the slow pace three wide early and continued to dawdle along three wide down the backstretch, then made a bid in the stretch and
slowly edged clear late to prove best under a drive. MR MONEY BAGS vied for the lead along the inside to the furlong marker and was outfinished late
while saving the place award. SUNLIT SONG was well placed along the inside and was boxed by the quarter pole, swung out four wide for racing room and
was slowly gaining late. MOOJAB JR was allowed to settle early while saving ground, advanced along the inside on the turn, then angled out by the
sixteenth pole and had a belated rally. MEN OF KYLE stalked the early pace four wide, then tracked the pace three wide and had no kick. GOLD PILOT
was allowed to settle while three wide, then came five wide into the drive and offered no serious rally. DIRECT DIAL tracked the pace between rivals and
weakened. GOTTHERIGHTONEBABY threw head up at the start, then was settled back, came six wide into the drive and had no rally.
