HE'S PRETTY LUCKY pressed the pace early two wide, was off the rail into the lane, edged past the leader in the stretch and held off rival in the final
stages. STONE SLINGER raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane, rallied in the stretch, made a late bid but did not have enough in the final
stages. FUTURO set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and yielded late in the stretch run. SONIC BURN chased the pace early, was in the four
path into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the stretch drive. SIR NUISANCE was never a threat. PHARAOH'S KITTEN broke very
awkwardly and was no factor. BUBBA CABALLO chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and eased down the lane. WESTERN PHAROAH
stalked the early duel, was taken up along the turn and distanced down the lane.
