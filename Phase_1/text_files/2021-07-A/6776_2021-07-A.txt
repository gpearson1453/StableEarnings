INFINITE PATIENCE away alertly and tracked the leader one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, forced the issue two wide in the run down
the backstretch, assumed control entering the final turn, and quickly drew clear while being geared down late, as much the best. SOLARITY stalked the
leaders while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, held a tracking trip two wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide
through the final turn, and closed two out from the rail in the drive to hold the place. PRINCESS OF CAIRO hopped at the start, but recovered quickly and
stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, held a tracking trip while continuing to save ground in the run to the final turn,
rallied two wide through the turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to just miss the place. MISS PROSPECTOR broke sharply and raced to the
lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run to the final turn, was overtaken entering the final turn, but faded over the final
furlong.

FIVE STAR GENERAL away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the second turn, opened a
clear margin in the run to the final turn, and increased his margin through the lane to prove much the best while being geared down late. SYNERGY tracked
the leader while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide
entering the final turn, was no threat to the winner in the lane, but finished willingly one out from the rail to hold the place. STAY FANTASTIC away alertly
and stalked the leader one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, settled off the pacesetter in the run down the backside, commenced his bid
from just off the rail entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to just miss the place. AT ATTENTION hopped at the start to get away slowly,
and trailed the field into the stretch the first time, tipped three wide and began to advance shortly after entering the backstretch, continued three wide into
the final turn, but hung in the late going. PITCH COUNT broke sharply and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the
rail, was unable to hold his position approaching the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

ANIMA pressed the leaders three wide entering the backstretch, rallied two wide from between rivals through the final turn, and closed willingly one out from
the rail in the drive to get up in the final strides. CUSHMAN ROAD away alertly and raced to a narrow lead two wide from between rivals entering the
backstretch, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the rail through the final turn, and finished determinedly in the lane, but was
nipped in the final strides. BAKZONE tracked the leaders while awaiting room in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn,
and closed three wide in the drive to garner a share. OUREVELADY unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched her bid three wide entering the
final turn, and found her best stride late, while stuck behind a wall of rivals. STEVIE'S SONG tracked the leaders three out from the rail entering the first
turn, while being jostled around, continued to track the pacesetters four wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, but
needed more late. ZETAMARIE away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the first turn, rallied two wide
entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. CATCHACOUGAR broke sharply and chased the leader into the first turn
while saving ground at the rail, remained forwardly placed to the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was
a jockey's and trainer's claim of foul. The rider of ZETAMARIE and the trainer of STEVIE'S SONG, both lodged claims of foul against the rider of ANIMA for
alleged interference entering the first turn. After review, both claims of foul were disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish

through the final turn, and held FULLY LENT safely at bay late. FULLY LENT away alertly and tracked the leader from along the rail in the run down the

trip approaching the final turn, rallied three wide through the turn, and finished evenly three wide in the drive to garner a share. REA MEA hesitated at the
start to get away slowly, tracked the leaders while on heels entering the first turn, maintained a tracking trip from along the inside in the run down the

THE VALENTINE KID settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, pulled his way along the rail into a tracking
trip approaching the final turn, rallied along the inside through the turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed willingly to be up in time.
NORTHERN KID away alertly and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, engaged the pacesetter with a
three wide move entering the final turn, assumed command leaving the turn, but was unable to fend off THE VALENTINE KID late, while proving easily
second best. ACCEPT NO OTHER away well and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his
position in the run down the backside, was shuffled back entering the final turn, but finished two wide in the drive to garner a share. NEW CANADIAN broke
sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the lane the first time, dictated the pace in the run down the backside, battled from along the inside
entering the final turn, but faded in the stretch drive. TUXEDO stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, gained
a tracking trip three wide in the run to the final turn, rallied four wide entering the turn, but needed more when called upon. COMMANDER B unhurried early
while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make an impact.
