WHISKEY DASH allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear late. MAXIMUM
FACTOR tracked the pace, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, shook clear, then was no match for the winner, while
clearly best of the rest. BIG CHICKEN MAN stalked the pace outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, gained a
short lead, then lacked the needed late kick to sustain his bid. SAMURAI ZIP vied for the early lead from between rivals, bid between, then weakened the
final furlong. BRAHMS BREEZE set the pace on the inside and weakened in the stretch run. PER RULING 21037PID FROM THE PENSYLVANIA HORSE
RACING COMISSION WHISKEY DASH WAS DQD FOR A POSITIVE TEST

late. WINROSE ELLIE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased her margin through the turn, then drew off in the lane and was outfinished.
SHOMETHESISTERS reared at the start, looped three and four wide through the turn, came widest into the stretch and closed well for the show. SOLO
TRY never far back, lost some ground three wide through the turn, then weakened through the stretch. PINE JUNCTION was a brief factor, inside. LIL H

Footnotes
MISSIONATTHESPA rated inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain and edged
up late. ANOTHER SOFTBALL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin to the final furlong, then weakened and held the place.
TEMPUS allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady gain and missed the place. WATCH
THE DIP mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, weakened late and saved a share. LEBASI allowed to
settle, looped four wide through the turn, bid five wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. EKATI CHAMPAGNE improved position. CHUCKLES CANDY
rushed up to stalked the pace outside, held position three and four wide through the turn, then faded in the stretch. SPINNING JOEY broke a step slowly
from the gate, looped three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and had no rally. MIKADO was no factor.
