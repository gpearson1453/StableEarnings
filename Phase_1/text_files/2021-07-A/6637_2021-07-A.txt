HEATHERFROMPHOENIX was hustled along from the gate, saved ground, responded with a burst of speed when set down through the stretch under left
handed urging, made the lead late and drew off. PEGGY'S COVE stalked the pace into the far turn, rallied to make the lead at the top of the stretch while
drifting out to the middle of the racetrack, maintained a narrow advantage while gradually drifting in until deep stretch then was no match for the winner.
NESSUM DORMA trailed for five furlongs then rallied belatedly two wide. MISS VICKI set the pace for to the top of the stretch, drifted to the four path then
weakened. MISS IRISH BOSS was no factor. SASSY ANGEL failed to respond. TIZ THIRSTY pressed the early pace along the rail and was through after a
half.

early, closed willingly in the five and six paths and finished well clear for second. BIONIC ROSIE had speed along the inside through the first turn, angled
out and headed the winner before a half, chased that one into the stretch then faded. BATI BATI was fractious in the gate prior to the start then no threat.

lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the rail into the stretch then weakened late. KARAKONTIE FLYER pressed the pace two wide into the
stretch and weakened in the fine sixteenth. MISS MAC vied for the lead three wide into the stretch then gave way. CRIMSON RIDE had brief speed.
SUSIES WHO was through early.
