HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run
down the backstretch and through the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, and inched clear late. DON'T TESS ME tracked the dueling leaders
in the run down the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, shifted two wide entering the lane, and
closed well to hold the place. TOBESUNNY was off a step slow, and was squeezed soon after the start in a compromised beginning, settled well off the
early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied smartly four wide through the final turn to loom a danger leaving the turn,
but was unable to sustain his prolonged drive late. SUNGOLD BEAUTY unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three wide through the final turn,
and finished five out from the rail in the drive. GOLD POST broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue
two wide in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, but faded in the stretch drive. PRINCESS SOIREE away well and tracked the contested

SIR BREGOVIC broke sharply and vied for the lead from along entering the first turn, assumed command entering the backstretch and dictated the pace
into the final turn, saved ground through the final turn, and held off a late bid by COULTERBERRY late while drifting out slightly in deep stretch.
COULTERBERRY unhurried early while dropping back to trail, advanced two wide midway down the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final
turn to loom an imposing threat leaving the turn, and finished evenly five wide in the drive to prove second best. R W STANLEY settled off the early pace
while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from just off the rail entering the final turn, and finished evenly three wide in the
stretch drive. DRILLER away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, but
faded in the late going. HOME RUN GUY away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, sat a tracking trip entering the
backstretch, struggled to keep tabs on the leader approaching the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

BLUEGRASS ANGUS broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn
while battling for the lead, assumed command leaving the turn, and inched away late while being kept to task. METAL MAGIC away alertly and raced to the
lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch, continued to battle for the lead through the final turn, was
unable to keep tabs on the winner entering the lane, but battled determinedly two wide in the drive to hold the place. QUAGMIRE away well and stalked the
leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, steadied when in tight quarters leaving the turn, and
finished three wide in the drive to be along for a share. TIZ MEOW unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and
finished four wide in the drive. THE CHANCES R settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. EUROPEAN stalked the leader in the run down the backstretch while
saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, steadied when put in tight quarters leaving the turn, and was through after taking up.
Following the running of this race, there were two jockey claims of foul. The riders of both EUROPEAN and QUAGMIRE lodged a claim of foul against the
rider of METAL MAGIC for alleged interference midway through the final turn. After review both claims of foul were disallowed, and no change was made to
the original order of finish

run down the backstretch and into the final turn, angled towards the rail leaving the turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in deep stretch to get
up in time. CHEF unhurried early while dropping back to trailed, bided his time at the back of the field through the second turn, advanced one out from the
