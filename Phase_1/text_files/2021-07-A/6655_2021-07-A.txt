PURE SUGAR sprinted to the lead shortly after the start, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and won under right handed urging. SHYLA never far
back, rallied along the inside into the stretch, drifted to the four path and finished clear for second. I GOT THE TIME passed tiring rivals outside in deep
stretch. CASCABRIA stalked the early pace and lacked the needed response. NICE RIDE chased the winner into the stretch and weakened in the final
furlong. EXTRA SALSA trailed.

Footnotes
GIO SAMMY bumped at the start, chased the pace into the stretch, rallied two and three wide to gain a narrow lead before the furlong marker and proved
best by the narrowest of margins in a game effort CANTANKEROUS BOBBY stalked the pace into the stretch, drew on even terms for the lead three wide
near the eighth pole, matched strides with the winner the balance of the trip and just missed. BUY IN never far back, finished with good courage five wide.
PRETTY STORMY drifted out at the start, closed ground along the rail into the stretch, lacked room nearing the eighth pole, altered course two wide then
finished evenly. FIFTEEN TO VEGAS failed to menace. ARCHIPELAGO broke in front, set the pace until deep stretch then weakened late. HEAVENLY
BLESSING bumped at the start, had speed into the turn then wilted. STARSHIP FONZY was shut off at the start then no factor. HE'S NO ANGEL was
outrun.

Footnotes
AUTHENTIC COWTOWN stalked the early pace, rallied two wide through the far turn to make the lead before the quarter pole, shook clear in upper stretch
and lasted under left handed urging. DOUBLE DEEP drifted out then checked over heels at the start, trailed early, closed rapidly three wide on the far turn,
evened off for a furlong then dug in determinedly through the final stages in the four path and was steadily cutting into the winners advantage late. DAVID'S
GEM sprinted to the lead two wide on the clubhouse turn, set the pace for nearly six furlongs along the inside then was outfinished. PORT HUNTER allowed
to settle, offered a bid two wide on the second turn then leveled off. VISUAL MISSION failed to menace. ALFRED was no threat. EIGHT AIN'T ENOUGH
chased the early pace and was through after a half.

Footnotes
LEO was restless in the gate prior to the start, stalked the pace three wide, rallied to make the lead in upper stretch and finished full of run under left handed
urging to win as much the best. SHADOW TRACER never far back, rallied late two wide and finished second best. REANIMATE made the lead soon after
the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch then was outfinished. MAGICAL EXPRESS passed tiring rivals. SKY WRITER had speed into the turn then
faded. KEYED ON TOP had brief speed. GRAN CITY pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then faltered.
