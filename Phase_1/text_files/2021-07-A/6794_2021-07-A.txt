ROYAL TO BE set the pace while in hand down the backstretch, continued on a clear lead through the turn and into the lane, was well clear when put under
vigorous hand urging, extended the advantage to the sixteenth pole then was geared down the last fifty yards. SENORITA EMMA chased the winner from
the two path through the turn and into the lane then continued to chase the top one home while well clear of the rest. JUSTA DOLL stumbled at the start,
raced in the two path through mid-turn, came off the inside and into the four path in late turn, came into the lane from the six path and moved up while not a
threat. SHES MY TREASURE was in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and weakened. BEAUTIFUL D chased
the pace along the inside through the turn then faded. MOMMA CRIBBED was always in the back while in the two path. PER RULING DATED 10/12/21
RECEIVED FROM THE INDIANA HORSE RACING COMMISSION (RULING IG-2021-2524), ROYAL TO BE WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

GLOWED chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the three or four path, caught the leader just after the three-sixteenths
pole and drove clear. WANTING set the pace while in the two path into the turn, began to lose lead from mid-turn, continued with a short lead into the lane,
was no match for the winner after straightening then kept on to save the distant place spot. PRIME N PROPER was never a threat while chasing the pace
from the four path through the turn and into the lane. READY TO MONBA was never a factor while near the rail. TRIP CHARGE raced in the three to four
path through the turn and made no impact. HASHTAG TOO FAST trailed throughout while along the inside.

Footnotes
CROSSED THE LINE stalked the pace from the three path into the turn, bid near mid-turn, gained a short lead in late turn, widened into the lane and
continued on a clear advantage to the wire while being kept to the task. LIBERTY BELLE set the pace from the two path into turn, was under pressure in
mid-turn, stayed with the winner into the lane then could not keep up while continuing on well to be clear for the place spot and second best. KHOSEA was
in the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the five path and lacked a closing kick. KITTEN ROCKS saved ground into the far turn, angled
off the rail and into the three path in late turn, continued on in the seven path in the lane and moved up a couple while never a serious factor. BLARNEY
GIRL was in the two path while chasing the pace down the backstretch, lost ground into the far turn and was never in it thereafter. EVIE was in the two path
through the turns and was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
CIELO BLU was unhurried while off the inside into the far turn, bid three wide through mid-turn, came in a path nearing the quarter pole, cleared after
straightening in the lane then was under a drive to the end to hold. SHA KON O HEY went to his nose at the start and spotted the field some three lengths,
raced in the back into the backstretch, moved up from near the rail into the turn, continued in the two path into the lane, gained momentum inside the eighth
pole, angled to the rail inside the sixteenth pole and was gaining to the wire. PRESTO BENCH was two wide and between rivals after mid-turn, lost his path
approaching the quarter pole, moved to the four path into the lane and offered a mild gain. HENRY RULES vied for the lead two wide into the far turn,
cleared on the backstretch, was pressured through late turn then gave way to others entering the lane. COWBOYS CAN'T CRY set the pace into the
backstretch, chased the leader into the far turn then faded along the rail. FORSBERG dropped far back through the turn and was distanced through the lane
and walked off. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #1 PRESTO BEACH AGAINST THE RIDER OF #3 CIELO BLU FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE
QUARTER POLE WAS DISALLOWED.

VOODOO JUSTICE went clear from the gate, led inside, fought back a challenger in the stretch and was clear under steady urging. TAPERINEA stalked in
the three path, bid late but couldn't get to the winner. SWIFT TEMPLE was unrushed early, bid four wide at the quarter pole and just missed the place.
MIZZEN ASH stalked in the four path, bid at the quarter pole, then rallied late six wide. DIAMOND SOLITAIRE raced in the two path and bid belatedly
between foes. TUCKYOURTALEANDRUN pressed the pace outside of the winner, bid in early stretch but then faded. BICKERMENTS saved ground but
had no late bid. FIGHTING ZELDA saved ground early, bid three wide at the quarter pole and closed late. SOUTHERN SMILE stalked the pace in the four
path, had no bid and gave way late. BLUESKIESATNIGHT saved ground and then faded. AMAZING GAL was not a factor.
