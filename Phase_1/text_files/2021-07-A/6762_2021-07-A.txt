BI BI CARPE away alertly set the pace being collared on the turn dueling from the rail down the stretch digging deep to prevail. AW ITE veered in pausing at
the break, rallied into the turn collaring rival into upper stretch bearing down abreast foe there only to be denied in the last yards. AUGER chased the pace
angling to mid track in upper stretch making up ground late. SIR HIGGINS chased the pace extending in the three path down the lane having some
response needing more. MACHO MANIA slow early saved ground to upper stretch improving modestly along the rail. PAISANO chased through the turn
weakening in the four path upper stretch. MR. TRIPLEDOUBLE hustled along in early pursuit was spent at mid track in upper stretch. LITTLE TEQUILA was
always outrun.

hustled to the top set the pace to the far turn kicking clear in the three path upper stretch only to be run down from the outside in the final yards. PURDY

weakening on the inside in upper stretch. LONG STORY SHORT tracked the pace looming on the outside into the far turn wavering in the four path upper
