Footnotes
ITASCA tracked the pace from along the inside into the far turn, moved up after mid-turn, bid from along the inside after the five-sixteenths pole, got through
the open rail to be on near even terms near the quarter pole, was bumped in the back-end and forced outward into the lane, continued on with a short lead
after straightening then edged clear late. GAMERA set the pace while off the inside into the far turn, continued with a short lead in late turn, was put in tight
entering the lane, continued with energy to duel with the winner to inside the eighth pole then yielded late. BOO REID chased the pace from the two or three
path, bid three wide in late turn, came in approaching the top of the lane, continued on to duel with the top two then could not keep up late. MIKE IS READY
was in the two path through the far turn and tired in the lane. TRAFFIC STOP brushed soon after the start, settled to the back and trailed throughout. A
STEWARDS INQUIRY CONCERNING THE RUNNING OF THE RACE NEAR THE QUARTER POLE FOUND NO REASON FOR CHANGE OF ORDER.

Footnotes
LUCY'S CAKES FLY raced on a clear lead while rated, continued to widen through the far turn when not being asked, was roused for more when
straightening in the lane then quickly drew off while being kept to the task to near the end. FIFTEEN STARS (IRE) tracked the pace along the inside through
the turns, bid into the lane then could only chase the winner home while just saving the place spot. CUZZYWUZZY was in the two path through the turn
when unhurried, bid into the lane from the three path, was no threat to the top one but was closing in on the place spot and missed. REMEMBRANCE was
never a factor while in the two or three path through the far turn. BEACH PEACH stalked the winner while in the two path through the far turn, asked for
more into the lane and was empty. THE STONE EVENT was far back while saving ground. RACE WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MISS DEPUTY STAR vied for the early lead two wide into mid-turn, cleared in late turn, widened into the lane when asked then was geared down the last
sixty yards. MISS FORT trailed into the lane while moving from the two to the four path, came into the lane from the five path and finished with good energy
to be clear for the place spot while not a threat to the top one. CECIL'S ANGEL stalked the pace from the three path, bid into the lane, was nearest the
winner with an eighth to go, began to get weary approaching the sixteenth pole, lost the place spot but had enough to save the show spot. QUICK AND
EASY settled back while in the three path, moved into the four path into the lane then lacked the needed finishing response. EXPRESS LADY was near the
rail through mid-turn, moved off the rail when gaining momentum in late turn, continued in the four path into the lane and never was a factor. HOOSIER
PREMIUM was near the rail through the turn and tired. C J S SUZIE BYU vied for the lead along the inside into mid-turn, chased into the lane then was
empty through the lane.

Footnotes
BREEZE RIDER set the pace while along the inside into the backstretch, continued on a clear lead into the far turn, asked for more in late turn, widened the
advantage to the eighth pole then held while being kept to the task. YLIKEDIS tracked the pace while along the inside through the far turn, came into the
lane from the three path, had aim on the winner while straightening then slowly gained to the end. TIMELESS ROSE saved ground through the turns, cut
the corner into the lane and slowly gained on the top ones while finishing best of the rest. COMPLETE was in the two or three path through the turn, came
into the lane from the three path and moved up while not a threat to the top three. THE BEAUTY'S TALE was never a factor while moving through the three
or four path through the turn and into the lane. WAR ROSE set the early pace into the backstretch, stalked the winner into late turn then was empty after
straightening in the lane. KEEPER REAL raced near the rail through the far turn and never was a factor. PURRFECTLY CLAIRE chased the pacesetters
into the far turn while in the three path then was empty entering the lane.

BIG FUDGE pressed the pace two wide into the turn, vied for the lead through late and into the lane, continued on near even terms with an eighth to go then
edged clear. RAMPAGE raced in the three path through the turn, continued in the three or four path into the lane and rallied. DILLSBORO DEVIL set the
pace while under pressure through the turn and into the lane, dueled with the winner to inside the eighth pole then yielded to that one. ALL STAR JUSTICE
was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and was gaining too late. UNBRIDLED VICTOR was off with a
slight hop, raced along the inside into the lane and offered a mild gain. BRAVO EXPRESS raced in the two path throughout and weakened in the lane.
EMPIRE'S SCORE was along the inside through the turn and faded through the lane.

IMPERIAL MISSION was unhurried while in the two path through the far turn, swung into the lane from the five path, caught the leaders inside the eighth
pole, quickly cleared while being ridden out and widened while under minimal urging late. S S TROOPER set the pace along the inside, lost the lead with an
eighth to go then regained the place spot while not a threat to the top one. ROCKY RUSH chased the pace while in the two path into the far turn, continued
close up in late turn, bid from the three path into the lane, gained the lead with an eighth to go then weakened late and lost the place spot. J W RUCKUS
was in the two path through the turn and moved up while not a serious threat. UNBRIDLED BEAST was never a threat while saving ground throughout.
OUTLIER tracked the pace while near the rail into the lane then tired. STEWARDS RULES chased the pace from the three path and was empty into the
lane. NOT VERY GENTLE was in the two or three path through the turns and was always last.

Footnotes
MONARCHS GLEN (GB) was put in tight at the start, settled back while saving ground, continued to race near the inside while advancing closer through the
far turn, angled into the seven path into the lane, gained momentum while straightening, advanced six wide near the eighth pole, brushed with another rival
inside the sixteenth pole and finished with a rush to be up in time. HEMP HEMP HURRAY was unhurried while in the two path into the far turn, angled into
the five path into the lane, advanced with momentum while seven wide near the eighth pole, brushed with the winner inside the sixteenth pole and was
outfinished. SPLIT THE WICKETS raced near the rail through the far turn, came off the inside to pass tiring rival in the lane, gained momentum inside the
sixteenth pole, looked to be a potential winner late then was outfinished by the top two. MIDNIGHT TEA TIME settled back early, moved four to five wide
through the turn, continued five wide into the lane and was gaining to the end. ALFONS WALDE (IRE) raced in the three path through the turn when never
far back, swung into the lane from the four path, was four wide and threatening inside the eighth pole then weakened late. STRONG TIDE stalked the pace
from the two path through the turn, bid into the lane, led an eighth out but could not sustain the effort. ARTEMUS EAGLE raced in the three path throughout,
came three wide into the lane, had aim with an eighth to go then flattened. PEEKACHO was in the three or four path through the far turn and weakened in
the lane. JOYFUL HEART set the pace along the inside then gave way entering the lane. TRUMPS REVENGE was never a factor while in the three path
through the far turn. CULLUM ROAD trailed throughout while near the inside. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #1 HEMP HEMP HURRAY AGAINST
THE RIDER OF #10 MONARCHS GLEN FOR INTERFERENCE LATE IN THE RACE WAS DISALLOWED.

momentum then leveled out while passing a couple. CHOATE BRIDGE saved ground through the turns, continued to save ground into the lane, had an

Footnotes
SOOTHSAY broke in the air and lunged, spotting the field some four lengths, trailed, bid three wide past the half-mile pole, shifted five wide for running
room into the stretch, bumped with a foe late and surged to the wire. MOON SWAG stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the quarter pole, led late and
was caught. LADY ACES stalked the pace in the three path, bid four wide at the quarter pole, bumped late with the winner outside of that one and was
outfinished. MARION FRANCIS pressed the pace outside of the leader, bid at the quarter pole but was outfinished. LOVELY RIDE led inside before giving
way in the stretch. WILL'S SECRET saved ground, bid at the quarter pole but faltered in the stretch. SWEET PEARL was unrushed and then failed to
menace. MALLOY stalked the pace inside before giving way on the far turn. LI'L TOOTSIE stalked the early pace between foes, then faded after a half mile.

Footnotes
MR. WIRELESS bobbled at the start, stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch, moved closer into the far turn to press the leader, asked for more after
mid-turn, cleared in late turn, continued on a clear lead into the lane while in the three or four path, slowly widened the advantage to the eighth pole then
extended the advantage to the wire while being kept to the task. SERMONONTHEMOUNT raced near the rail while never far back, shifted into the two path
in late turn to pass a tiring rival, entered the lane from the two path and finished with good energy near the inside to be clear for the place spot. FULSOME
was unhurried while trailing for half, split rivals into the far turn when gaining momentum, moved three wide into late turn, came into the lane from the four
path, shifted to the six path under steady left-handed urging, shifted back into the five or four path late when urged right-handed and just got up for the show
spot while not a threat to the top two. STARRININMYDREAMS chased the pace from the three path, bid three wide after mid-turn, continued three wide into
the lane when a serious threat then flattened out inside the eighth pole. CONVENTION was unhurried when off the inside, moved through the three then
four path on the far turn, bid five wide into the lane, dropped to the two path when straightening and was done. W W CRAZY set the pace while near the rail
and under pressure from the winner through mid-turn then gave way near the five-sixteenths pole.
