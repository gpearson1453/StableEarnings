FLATTERINGAPPLAUSE was rated last racing a bit off the rail in the opening stages, gained position between foes entering the turn, shifted three wide
nearing upper stretch advancing on the leaders, bid for command in that path racing past the furlong marker, shifted out late but wrested the advantage and
went clear under firm handling. PEAK OF CHIC was urged prompting a rival's pace through the backstretch into the turn, pressed the issue between foes
through the stretch and narrowly prevailed for the place honors while failing to contain the winner. LATTE DOLCE, in touch with the leaders three wide in
early stages, conceded some position to those foes entering the turn, was fanned four wide while being prompted to advance with the eventual winner
nearing upper stretch but couldn't match that rival's late kick while continuing with a steady late response to edge a rival for a share on the wire.
FORTHELOVEOFLYDIA broke readily, was urged to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside in the opening stages, dueled for command
inside a rival on the turn into upper stretch but weakened late when a rival struck his rider's whip. GOLDEN EYED QUEEN was prompted to a contending
position inside foes in the opening stages, was eased off the leaders after the opening three sixteenths, was steadied a bit along the rail avoiding close
quarters midway through the turn and had no closing response.

Footnotes
I'M BOSSY broke sharply, attended the pace three deep racing to the turn, was urged to press the issue racing into upper stretch, edged forward in late
stages and held the late challenge of CYNICAL GIRL under strong handling. The latter tracked off the first flight four deep in early stages, angled inwards
nearing the bend, shifted to the four path nearing midstretch and continued willingly in that path to close the gap on the winner nearing the wire. TIZ
TENACIOUS was urged between foes to gain the advantage dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, dueled for command inside the eventual
winner into upper stretch remaining off the rail but weakened in late stages. SHES GOT IT hopped while ducking out at the start losing position to the field,
was righted to gain a position just out of striking distance racing five wide early, continued to make brief progress four wide through the turn but flattened out
in the drive. ULTRA CORDIAL raced between foes while dropping well off the leaders after the opening furlong, shifted out six wide racing into upper stretch
while regaining some position but had no closing bid. JAKEALINA settled in last early while angling to the inside and failed to menace thereafter. SATIN
FINISH was urged inside foes in the opening stages prompting the pacesetter racing to the turn but gave way nearing upper stretch.

DANCERONTHEBEACH, bumped at the start, was urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a clear margin for a half, turned back foes racing
through the far turn to regain a clear advantage in upper stretch, drifted out markedly despite right handed pressure but increased his margin in the closing
stages. TRADE DEADLINE hopped at the start, was reserved off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, pulled his way to
contention on the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance but proved only second best. ALWAYS COOL
broke inwards bumping the eventual winner, was rated tracking just off the pacesetter inside foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, conceded some
position under patient handling nearing the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch, then was roused along the rail in the stretch to advance inside foes but
couldn't gain terms with the winner and was outkicked for second. WARRIORS HERO tracked the pace between foes in the second flight, advanced on the
pacesetter to lodge a brief bid between foes on the far turn but flattened out racing into the stretch. D C HERO tracked the pacesetter three deep just off the
second flight in early stages, advanced in that path racing into the far turn to briefly gain striking distance but steadily faded in the drive. The six furlong time
was omitted pending review.

PEPPER SPRAY was settled off the second flight racing three deep into the turn, came under pressure nearing the midway point of the bend, shifted out to
the five path in upper stretch and produced a stout rally racing through the lane to wrest command and go clear under pressure. BASALT STREET switched
outside rivals in the opening stages to gain terms with the leaders attending the pace under light rating racing into the bend, was urged to challenge three
deep nearing upper stretch, shifted inwards crossing into the path of WILLWORKFORFOOD leaving midstretch while gaining a brief advantage and proved

issue outside the eventual winner to midstretch but proved no match late. SAHM TEQUILA settled well off the leaders shifting out six wide early, gained
some position racing five wide into the lane, drifted inwards under pressure nearing midstretch but continued with interest to gain a share late.
HOLDENTIGHT, brushed at the start, was urged between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch into the lane and weakened in late stages.
RUBY'S RED DEVIL exchanged bumps with JEROMIEO at the start, angled to the inside dropping well off the first flight, then shifted out in the lane to gain
some position between foes late while racing in close quarters leaving midstretch. JEROMIEO exchanged bumps with RUBY'S RED DEVIL at the start, was
settled racing four wide between foes, then angled to the inside racing into the lane while proving no threat. GETCHA tracked off the first flight racing five

Footnotes
SILVERA broke readily, prompted the pace inside a rival while under light rating racing to the backstretch, edged forward on the far turn, forged clear under
stout pressure racing through the stretch and maintained a clear advantage to the end. EVERYBODY DOES IT was rated off the second flight along the
inside in early stages, swung out racing into the far turn, shifted to the three path entering the lane and continued with a steady late bid to close the gap on
the winner late. DUSTY PRINCESS settled last while angling nearer to the inside racing to the backstretch, angled out five wide racing through upper
stretch and found her best stride late to close the gap on the top pair while edging a rival for a share on the wire. TEQUILA MARY settled well off the leaders
while angling inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and made an effort to gain position late while just outkicked for a share.
MCGOLDIE, caught outside foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside after a half, saved round to the lane but offered
no rally. GET ONE MORE, urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the backstretch, gave way between foes racing into the far turn. FRIENDLY
AND KIND tracked off the first flight under rating to the backstretch, made brief progress three deep racing into the far turn but emptied out abruptly in the
drive.

BIG LEAGUE BENNY raced three deep between foes tracking the pacesetter from out of striking distance on the backstretch, continued between foes on
the bend, shifted to the three path in upper stretch steadily advancing to challenge. then took charge leaving midstretch and went well clear late under firm
right handed encouragement. WARRIOR BOSS tracked the pacesetter inside rivals racing through the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and
continued with interest inside foes to edge a rival for the place honors in late stages. SORRISO broke sharply, went readily to command, dictated the pace
on a commanding margin racing well off the rail into upper stretch and gave out once headed by the winner. GOT EVEN SMARTER tracked the pacesetter
four wide on the backstretch moving to terms with the second flight but offered no closing bid. FLASH OF PROMISE, off slowly, settled off the second flight
racing to the turn but never gained contention. TWO THE PUNCH tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight in the opening quarter and gave way
racing into the turn.

Footnotes
IM A COWBOY TOO was rated just off the leaders along the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily drew into range inside a rival on the far turn, tipped
out three deep racing through upper stretch advancing between foes to challenge for command, was headed by SHAKES CREEK in late stages but turned
back that foe in time under firm handling to prevail. The latter stalked just off the first flight outside the eventual winner racing in the two path, then three path
nearing the lane, was fanned four wide into upper stretch, moved to challenge for command between calls late but was just outkicked. TWO BY TWO,
bumped at the start, was rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, gained position three deep leaving the far turn, was fanned five
wide in upper stretch and continued with a solid late response to close the gap on the top pair late. SKIPPY'S STRIKE, forwardly placed stalking just off the
pacesetter racing to the backstretch, steadily moved to terms with that foe racing into the far turn, pressed the issue into upper stretch to strike the front but
gave out late. KOKOKOMO, reserved between foes, then along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, then shifted out late
while failing to make a serious impression. MITHQAAL broke inwards bumping TWO BY TWO, was righted, then urged to the lead setting the pace on a
narrow margin to the backstretch, dueled inside a rival on the far turn into upper stretch and gave way leaving midstretch. The six furlong time was omitted
pending review.
