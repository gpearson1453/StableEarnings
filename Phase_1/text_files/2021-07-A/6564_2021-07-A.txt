Footnotes
CARMEN MIRANDA stalked between rivals into the turn, took aim three wide exiting the bend, chased the runner-up through the stretch then launched a
late bid and overhauled rival. ZUBOSHI sped clear to take control, inched away around the turn, roused in upper stretch, challenged inside the sixteenth
pole and yielded late. BUSKER ALLIE settled along the inside, came out into the stretch, angled back inside upper stretch and gained the show. MAGGIE
FITZGERALD raced in range outside rivals, angled in a few paths to race three wide into the lane, drifted out in upper stretch then drifted inward through the
final furlong and flattened. ALLWINEDUP entered the turn three wide, came five wide into the stretch and could not rally. ADDYDIDIT lacked early speed,
angled to the rail on the turn and failed to menace. SUMMER PUDDING chased three wide into the turn, angled in around the bend, tired in the drive and
was not persevered with late.

LUCKY RYAN SEVEN came away alertly, vied outside DAPPER for the early lead, cleared that rival approaching the three-eighths, led two to three wide
into the stretch and remained clear under strong handling. ED GATTY chased three wide through the turn, tipped out in upper stretch, could not threaten the
winner in deep stretch but proved second best. DAPPER sent early and vied for command inside the winner, could not keep pace nearing the three-eighths,
chased two wide into the stretch and kept on to secure the show. WICKED BLUE raced in ranged outside rivals, came five wide into the lane and never
produced a bid. SHUSTER angled inside on the top pair, chased through the turn while saving ground and weakened. DANCING IN PARIS traveled two
wide into the turn, raced a bid off the rail into the stretch, came out in the lane and never threatened.

Footnotes
AVISSE tracked off the rail, angled five wide leaving the far turn, bid outside in upper stretch and edged clear. BOSSY SOUL stalked in the two path around
the first turn, loomed four wide around the final bend, launched a bid in upper stretch, got outkicked by the winner and held the place. MOREAVINO raced
three wide around the first turn, angled in entering the far turn, saved ground then came two wide into the stretch, finished well inside the leaders and gained
the show. CLASS CODE broke out, went five wide around the first turn, three wide around the second bend and churned on to close the gap late. MAMAS
GOT CASH hustled early, showed speed from inside but could not match the early pacesetter, moved off the rail, launched a bid at the half-mile pole,
cleared into the second bend, lost command in upper stretch and flattened out. PANCAKES AND BEER leaned back and hopped at the start, went two to
three wide outside a rival into the stretch and was never a factor. PREDETERMINATION traveled six then five wide around the first turn, four to five wide
around the second and tired. INDI GALLE sprinted to the front five wide into the first, cleared and angled into the three path around that bend, challenged at
the four furlong mark, could not keep pace into the far turn, dropped back around the bend and tired.

DRIZELLA stumbled at the start, stalked three to four wide around the turn, drew alongside in upper stretch, cleared nearing the furlong marker and held
well. CONNIE SWINGLE got knocked into rival at the start, became rank entering the turn, moved out and entered the stretch four wide, put in a late bid but
was not enough. SALLY STANFORD brushed from outside leaving the gate, set the pace in the two path, asked in upper stretch but faltered in the late
stages. SUE ETTAS GHOST broke in and bumped rival at the start, went three wide through the turn, came out in upper stretch and lacked a rally.
DREAMER GIRL hit inner portion of the gate then shifted in soon after, settled in the two path and also lacked a rally. WHAT A WAY TO GO broke slow and
outward, navigated the turn three then four wide and failed to make an impact. PRECIOUS INSIGHT chased on the inside to the stretch and faded.

WILLY THE COBBLER settled off the pace, crept closer up the backstretch, slit the top pair at the three-eighths, held a short lead over the runner-up
through lane, shook free at the eighth pole and won going away. A. P. PHAROAH went five wide into the first turn then angled into the three path, bid four
deep at the three-eighths, challenged WILLY THE COBBLER to the eighth pole and faltered in the late stages while clearly second best. MAYHEM AND
CHAOS took the first turn five then four wide, steered into the two path on the backstretch, angled five wide exiting the far turn and was along for the show.
SIROCCO vied for the lead with THANKS MAGGIO early and got floated out into the first turn, came back to the three path around that turn, dueled up the
backstretch and into the far turn, failed to match strides with WILLY THE COBBLER nearing the three-eighths and weakened. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG)
had early speed then became rank entering the first turn, steered to the inside around the bend, dueled with SIROCCO to the far turn, was overtaken at the
three-eighths, dropped back around that bend and was eased in the drive and walked off.

SAMURAI CHARM broke in and bumped rival at the start, inched closer four then three wide around the turn, shifted in while drawing alongside the leader
at the eighth pole, put a head in front with a sixteenth remaining and inched away. TROUVILLE angled to the rail entering the turn, came back out and
exited the bend four wide, steered widest in the stretch and finished well for the place honors. TIL I FOUND YOU was forwardly placed early, headed rival at
the three-eighths, took over shortly after, cleared into the drive, held a short lead with a furlong to go and yielded late. ACAI stumbled a bit at the start,
tracked two wide through the turn and lacked a serious bid. V BUCKS got bumped leaving the gate, dropped back early, navigated the turn four then five
wide and never threatened. MAJESTIC GIGI took the lead early from inside, set the pace to the turn, headed by rival at the three-eighths, relinquished
control soon after, fought to the five-sixteenths pole and weakened. LATER DAYS chased three then four wide around the turn and weakened.

SIGNOFTHECROSS was closest in pursuit through the early stages, bid outside past the three-eighths, vied for the lead into the lane, three deep in upper
stretch and took control, dueled with the runner-up through the late stages while being floated in and prevailed. GEORGE HERMAN RUTH got bumped from
inside at the start, traveled three wide around the clubhouse turn, bid four wide on the second bend, dueled outside SIGNOFTHECROSS past the
three-sixteenths pole, drifted in and could not get by. LOVESICK BLUES hustled to the front, cleared into the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch,
challenged from outside on the far turn, lost command in upper stretch, drifted to the inside late and held the show. I'LL STAND TALLER stalked on the
inside, saved ground around the far turn, bid inside upper stretch, could not kick on with the top pair in mid-stretch, steadied briefly behind LOVESICK
BLUES in the furlong grounds and flattened out. TABLE FOR TEN broke out and bumped rival at the start, angled out into the stretch and lacked further
response.

Footnotes
DADDY'S GIRL got bumped from both sides at the start, traveled off the pace, moved closer up the backstretch, was in tight between runners at the
five-sixteenths pole, rallied inside the leader, struck the front mid-stretch, moved clear and was kept to task to the wire. CONSIDER ME GONE pressed the
pace from outside, headed the leader at the four furlong mark, took over with three-eighths remaining, lost command in mid-stretch then came back on but
was too late. MEDUSA'S GAZE got bumped from both sides at the start, stalked outside a rival, came four wide into the stretch held for third. BIG GAME
PLAN broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, sat off the pace early on, swung seven wide into the stretch and missed the show. MY SIS CINDY broke
out and bumped rival, set the pace inside a pair of rivals, raced on even terms at the half-mile pole, lost command at the three-eighths, chased two wide into
the stretch and weakened. HOT AND A MESS bumped with inside rival at the start, stalked along the inside, angled out upper stretch and could not rally.
SEE YOU AT THE TOP attended the pace three deep, drifted six wide into the stretch and faded. SWEET MEG broke out and bumped rival, raced along
the inside, came off the rail on the far turn and was never a factor.
