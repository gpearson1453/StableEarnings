Footnotes
KRIS T. pressed the leader from the outside, continued to force the issue into the far turn, put a head in front late in the final turn, extended that advantage a
bit past the furlong marker, edging away late under steady handling.. FOUR PRINCESSES broke on top, showed the way into the first turn closest to the
inside, continued to narrowly set the pace in the run up the backstretch, headed by the winner turning for home, gave ground grudgingly that one through
the stretch. NANA'S JOY settled off the pace while along the inside, asked along late in the final turn, three wide into the lane, rallied to be well clear for the
show, no match for the top pair. AMELIA MADELYN last away, lacked speed, moved out, advanced with a four wide middle move to race closest to the top
pair in the far turn, flattened out in the drive to lose the show. LADY RAD four wide when behind the pace through the first turn, gave way drive, jogged in.
MEMORY MAGIC finished early, finished far back, jogged in.

CARONDELET behind the pace while racing inside, continued to save ground through the turn, moved closer when straightened for home, tipped out for
room nearing the furlong ground, late bid, proved best. LUCKY PRIORITY away in good order, set the pace inside, roused right handed into the lane, shook
clear, could not contain the winner, clearly second best. BIRDCATMOUSE void of speed, moved out to come widest for the drive, rallied down the middle of
the strip for the show, not a threat to the top pair. TOTALLY GRACE within striking distance outside, four out to five wide exiting the turn, came up empty for
the drive. STOP THE FRIEND away best of all, vied up front while between horses for a half and began to falter. BIND ON EARTH showed speed for a half
off the inside, three wide and between horses through the turn, also gave way in the drive.

WILD MALLORY broke outward but alertly, sprinted clear the opening furlong, was given a bit of a breather through the turn while still holding a daylight
advantage, maintained a comfortable lead to the wire under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. DUEFORADATE bumped soundly at the start, settled off
the early pace, saved ground turn, asked along late in the bend, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best. POOPSIE DOOPSIE back
off the pace while moving toward the inside, two path turning for home, improved from between horses to be up for the show. CATCAKE back off the pace
and the inside, came three wide and under pressure into the lane, advanced to be closest to the top two past the furlong marker, flattened out a bit, caught
for the show late. SUMMERTIME BANDIT broke in to float the runner up in a bit, was straightened to chase the winner for three furlongs, gave way in the
drive. TEN COUNT OUT in the second flight off the inside, four wide turning for home, had little left for the stretch run. BROKE FINANCING broke out and
soundly bumped the runner up just as that one was being floated in, steadied, trailed throughout.

BLUE RIDGE HONOR away in good order, was clear out of the chute, continued to show the way up the backstretch, was given a breather under light
restraint through the turn, remained clear through the lane under firm handling. DARING DARIAN back off winner, moved a bit closer through the turn,
roused for the drive, slowly gaining on the winner late but did not have enough for that one late, far clear of the others. STORMY COLLISION chased the
winner up the backstretch, lost the second position through the turn, one paced through the stretch to finish up best of the rest. TOSHITA FOREVER broke
back, was never dangerous. CAUSEWAYCAT settled off the pace, had little for the drive. LORANGER LINDA last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
SMITTYS PATRIARCH away well, dueled up front closest to the inside, shook off the other speed when straightened for home, kept to task through the lane
in holding the runner up safe late. BERNIE SPECIAL allowed the pace to go early, saved ground into straight, roused, shifted out, slowly gaining late.
MAGAWILDTIME lacked speed four three furlongs, dropped to the inside past the furlong marker, rallied up the rail to be clear for the show.
STONECATCHER closest to the dueling leaders off the inside, had little left for the stretch run. NO QUARTER last away, moved up to race in mid pack,
came up empty when called on for the drive. MY PAL MATTIE dueled up front while outside the winner, faltered in the drive. COHERE fell back to trail after
the start, never a threat.

Footnotes
IBEGTODIFFER back off the early pace outside, began a steady advance before a half, put a head in front past the furlong marker, kicked clear under
steady handling. MIDNIGHT TRIP broke back, continued to lack speed in trailing for a half, set down for the drive, late rally through traffic to be clear for the
place. MISSBUDLITELIME broke alertly, narrowly set the pace along the inside, continued to show the way into the lane under pressure, weakened when
headed by the winner past the furlong marker. ENVOYS LEGACY fractious while loading, broke in good order, pressed the issue from the outside for just
over a half and also weakened when in counted the final furlong. EXECUTIVE COUNCIL flashed brief speed along the inside, faltered in the drive. LINDA'S
LEGACY in the second flight early, failed to muster a response when called on for the drive. SOCIAL GALAXY remained back while racing four wide out of
the turn. CRYPTO BRAVE in mid pack for a half, retreated.

Footnotes
TENSAS THOUGHT broke on top, maintained inside position up front while firmly in hand into the first turn, helped set a soft set of fractions in the run up
the backstraight, narrowly showed the way into the lane, long drive, dug in late to narrowly prevail. SMOK'N RITA used while four wide and with the pace
into the first turn, dueled throughout while outside the winner, proved stubborn in the drive and gamely preserved the second spot late. ALLIACEOUS lacked
speed while firmly in hand toward the inside, two path second turn, asked along in the three path entering the stretch, steered out widest past the furlong
marker and finished up willingly to be getting to the top two late. TECATE TIME four wide into the first turn when within striking distance, continued in the
second flight outside the middle half, remained within contact of the top two into the lane, lacked a winning late punch. STORIED TRIP behind the leaders
off the inside, dropped to the rail onto the backstretch, saved ground into the lane, also lacked a closing response. MI LIA fell back off the pace, continued to
lag the middle half, four wide into the lane, improved position slightly while not a serious threat. THEBOYZGALAXY void of speed in trailing most of the way,
came five wide into the lane, failed to rally. JET SWEEP settled in mid pack, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
SHAE'S DAY broke back, lacked speed out of the chute, continued to race back in the run up the backstretch, came five wide out of the turn, moved out
widest for the drive, finished with good resolve down the center of the track to be up in time. SUPER FACTOR settled in mid pack off the inside, came five
wide and just in front of the winner exiting the turn, also closed well to miss between rivals and inside the winner. HONOR MY SPEED forwardly placed
outside early, joined the fray up front midway on the turn, vied four wide into the lane, continued to do battle past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly
to the top two late. SOUTHPINE GIFT in the second flight, moved out and challenged three wide and between foes late in the turn, remained in the first
flight past the furlong marker, not enough in the late going. TIZ THE DUDE set or forced the pace off the inside, held a narrow advantage past the furlong
marker, weakened. DOUBLE COOL lacked speed, saved some ground turn, improved position with some mild, belated interest. WAYFARING STRANGER
broke on top, with the pace closest to the inside, continued along the inside turning for home, began to give way soon after. PRE HEAT failed to menace.
TAKEN BACK last away, lacked speed, six wide turning for home, failed to rally. CARRIER PIGEON with the early pace, began a steady retreat just before
a half while out in the strip.
