ROYAL COUP vied along the inside, came out in the stretch under a left handed whip then held rival safe in the last furlong. KID MACHO saved ground, bid
into the stretch, was blocked and altered course then went evenly. BOZZINI well placed outside the dueling leaders, continued well for the show.
POLITICAL was outrun in the two path and lacked a rally. QUALITY SPECIAL vied outside to the stretch, drifted in and retreated. A claim of foul by the
second finisher against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

PUTTHEGLASSDOWN settled outside, advanced on the turn then wore down the pacesetters and edged clear. STAR LUCK quickly clear inside, led to the
stretch and continued well to the finish. A MAIZE ZING RIP angled inside down the backstretch close up then went evenly late. SARGEANT DRIVE dropped
far behind then offered some late energy. COBBLE HILL lacked speed inside, swung wide into the stretch and was no threat. MY DANZIG PARTNER
prompted the pace outside to the stretch then faltered. WEEKEND IN COURT lagged far behind then passed a fading opponent. SHANDIAN saved ground
off the pace and stopped after half a mile.

Footnotes
NINETYPERCENTBRYNN forced the pace outside, took over near the top of the stretch and drew away while kept to her business. PEYTON ELIZABETH
hustled to the front inside, was collared by stablemate into the stretch and lasted for the place. ENOUGH LOVE dropped back near the inside, angled out
into the stretch and closed well. ASSUME CONTROL prompted the pace three wide and began fading at the quarter pole. CURRENT SITUATION saved
ground just behind the leaders and gave way. LAST GREAT dropped back in the opening quarter and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MON CHERIE advanced outside strongly on the turn, moved clear in the final furlong and just lasted. LADY MISTRESS inside early, swung seven wide into
the stretch and gained too late. PAPI'S BABY GIRL prompted the pace wide to the stretch and weakened. JAMIE'S WANDERLUST forced the pace, split
rivals into the stretch and went evenly late. OAK CREEK CANYON angled inside earning a narrow advantage then faded in the stretch. DIAL A LADY
dropped back early and lacked a rally. ALMOST EVIL vied for the lead in the two path and proved empty in the stretch. GET HER READYEDDIE broke
slowest and raced far behind and was no factor. BOCA ROYALTY ducked out at the start, raced wide and was outrun.
