Footnotes
SMOOKIE chased and rounded the turn just off the rail, altered course to the outside of the initial pace-setter in mid-stretch and took over from that one the
final stride. WOLF CREEK PASS drew clear approaching the three eighths pole and was pressured from the quarter, raced off the rail on the turn, dug in
under steady stretch encouragement but was caught in the final stride and just lasted in second. WOMEN NOT EASY gave chase through the backstretch,
raced in the three path of the turn and dug in through the lane while gaining on the runner-up. SUPER WILDCAT chased toward the inside, rounded the turn
at the rail then flattened the final sixteenth. URKILLINGMEBETH chased outside, rounded the turn about the six path and passed a rival in the stretch.
FULLMOON BAY chased and rounded the turn about the five path, then weakened. SINGLE MOM gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn then
weakened.

Footnotes
MERRY MERRY MOJO raced well back from early contention in the three and four paths and left the second turn outside, started a bid past the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn five wide, surged to the front later yards and widened approaching the wire. BABY WHITE SOX rated a short lead off
the rail, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady stretch encouragement, but was
caught flattening stride later yards. JACOB T ran in the four path the first turn and settled just off the pace from the seven eighths pole, started a bid past the
seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn three wide and was just up for third under the wire. TRUE CROSSING rated close about the three path
then challenged from the seven sixteenths pole, continued a factor off the rail on the far turn but flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole and was nipped
from third under the wire. MARU'S RAVEN raced in the four path the opening turn and settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, bid approaching the
three eighths, rounded the far turn four wide but showed little further. PERSEVERED rated close to the early pace inside, picked up the chase toward the
seven sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. ELLERBE saved ground well off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch.

SONDE ST BLUES tapered in and took the lead two deep nearing the nine sixteenths pole, drew clear past the seven sixteenths and came under pressure
approaching the five sixteenths, contested the rail on the far turn then dug in under steady stretch encouragement to just last. ALLEN CAN DO IT raced in
the three path the first turn and entered the backstretch toward the outside, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and challenged in the three path of
the far turn, however, he bore out under a left hand crop past the eighth pole, though dug in when straightened away and was gaining on the winner in a
strong finish. FREEDOM RIDER was bumped and jostled at the break then saved ground the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn about the three path and was along for third later yards. STRONG LIL KOKORO raced well back from early contention off the rail the first turn, bid
leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the seven path and finished evenly outside. JUST GETS BETTER was bumped off stride leaving
the gate and saved ground the first turn, gave chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened stride in the lane. BOSS E
BOOGS raced with the pace most of the opening quarter mile then stalked from the nine sixteenths pole, but dropped back toward the three eighths, raced
near the rail on the far turn and weakened through the lane. WESTBURY ESTATES came out at the break to make contact with Freedom Rider then made
contact with Just Gets Better, saved ground on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. IN THE GOSPEL broke awkwardly and
made contact with Freedom Rider, rounded the first turn about the three path and showed little response from the three eighths pole. SPANGLISH rounded
the first turn about the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, showed little response past the three eighths pole and faded on the far turn. The
Stewards posted the inquiry and reviewed the stretch run before making this race official.

Footnotes
LINEAGE was unprepared for the break and dropped well back from early contention, angled to the outside to give chase, circled rivals in the six path of the
turn then closed with a strong steady bid to get up the final yards. WHO'S YOUR DADDY pressured the pace through the backstretch and took the nod past
the quarter pole, raced in the three path of the turn and dueled at even terms in the upper stretch, drew briefly clear in later yards, but was caught flattening
stride nearing the wire. STONES ROAD chased the early pace outside, raced off the rail on the turn then angled to the four path toward the head of the
lane, flattened stride in later yards but was gaining on the waning runner-up. MY LITTLE FANNY was hustled to the lead approaching the seven sixteenths
pole and set a pressured pace, gave up the nod at the rail past the quarter pole, continued a factor through the upper stretch then relented the final
sixteenth. EARTH ANGEL chased and rounded the turn off the rail, drifted a bit into the stretch, lugged inward in the upper stretch and finished evenly.
ERICA JANE pressured the early pace three wide but dropped back toward the five sixteenths pole and weakened in the four path of the turn. BRONX
PRINCESS became fractious in the gate and was removed for inspection by the vet, kept close to the early pace inside then faded at the rail on the turn.
