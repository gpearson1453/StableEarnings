Footnotes
FOGGY KITTEN drifted out while in hand as she vied then edged ahead for the early lead, angled back in near the half mile marker, was challenged early in
the bend, let out slightly and moved ahead approaching the quarter pole, responded to mild urging in the lane and maintained full control. WELL MAID
forwardly placed inside, waited for room on the turn, got through inside rivals nearing the quarter pole, took over second, swung outside FOGGY KITTEN for
the stretch run, was all out, no match for the latter but clearly best of the others. LIL BIT TIPSEY raced in contention from outside, gained third widest on the
bend then could only just hold her position through the stretch. CAROLINA BEAST failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. SEA MY MOVES broke alertly,
was sent to vie for the lead outside FOGGY KITTEN but began to yield after three furlongs.

DR. LIECHTY edged ahead of DANCIN NICKY midway on the backstretch, was challenged from outside leaving the bend, lost the lead upper stretch but
battled back with a sixteenth left and prevailed. PURGING THE STONE a step slow at the break, moved up quickly outside DR. LIECHTY, went for the lead
on the turn, drew ahead under urging upper stretch, was all out in the late going but had to settle for being easily second best. BUDDY BUD chased from
outside, lost ground three to five wide through the turn, took over third upper stretch then could only just hold his position late. LEFT COAST DREAMS
chased from off the inside, improved position upper stretch then leveled off. JACK N JOHN soon trailed, saved ground taking the bend, angled out widest
upper stretch and lacked a significant response. DANCIN NICKY displayed early speed inside but began to yield early in the turn.

B'S TURNING POINT settled briefly, gradually advanced just off or along the rail once on the backstretch to gain the lead into the lane, drew away under
urging upper stretch and was kept to task until the final sixty yards. AWINBENEATHMYWINGS well placed inside, angled out for a clear path into the
second bend, gained second three wide then could only pull away for the place the last furlong. TRAVEL ACCOUNT chased from outside, lost ground as he
advanced five wide on the second turn then caught BOLD AND BRASSY for third late. BOLD AND BRASSY raced in contention between horses from the
beginning, was two wide on the second bend, lodged a mild bid along the rail in the stretch, had third inside the final eighth but was outfinished. REVEILLE
soon trailed, picked up his pace along the rail on the second turn, gradually angled out through the lane but failed to have a significant bid. TEARS ON A
RIVER displayed early speed just off the inside but gave way between rivals through the stretch. WAVE THE GOLD pressed the early speed from outside
but gave way four wide before finishing six furlongs.

AMERICAN SUCCESS rated along the rail, was roused from inside on the second turn, took over upper stretch and held on under steady handling. JOEY B
hesitated at the break, was settled just off the inside, commenced his bid after a half mile, lost ground widest taking the second bend, closed the gap
belatedly deep stretch but caught DAVKA for second. DAVKA showed first, set a pressured pace, had the rail on the second turn, drifted out to path four into
the lane and gradually yielded. TOCCETIVE JAC shuffled back a bit at the start, progressed from outside on the backstretch, saved ground taking the
second bend, made a strong move along the rail in the stretch but came up short. NOT CHOPPED LIVER vied for the lead outside DAVKA for more than six
furlongs, was carried out by the latter into the stretch and began to yield. MCHENRY retreated from inside on the backstretch, angled out on the second turn
and failed to have a stretch bid. QUARTER AND FINAL TIMES UPDATED AFTER REVIEW

Footnotes
AUNT STELLA was encouraged to a quickly lead, showed the way just off the inside, was roused leaving the quarter pole and maintained control under a
steady drive through the lane. CREAL DREAMER in the second flight toward the outside on the backstretch, angled in some on the bend, moved clear for
second, drifted out some inside the last furlong, was corrected, could not close the gap on the leader but proved easily second best. DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT
left the gate slowly then was bumped, chased from outside, angled in then back out to advance taking the turn, moved out five wide at the top of the stretch
and caught LINDALOUIMAGE for third late. LINDALOUIMAGE chased from outside, advanced four wide on the turn, gained third upper stretch, could not
sustain her bid in the waning yards but was clearly best of the others. PRETTY LADY TOO in contention from inside, gave way the final two furlongs. LADY
DI in midpack early just off the inside, clipped LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS' heels at the half mile marker, was checked solidly, angled out widest on the bend,
drifted out to the middle of the track entering the stretch and improved position without threatening. LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS in close quarters between rivals
early, altered in some nearing the half mile marker, clipped SHINE DOWN'S heels, was checked and altered in, angled back out some after impeding LADY
DI, progressed three wide on the turn but gave way for the drive. CREAL ANGEL broke slowly and outward, bumping DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT, was soon
well back, saved ground, lacked a stretch bid and her rider lost his whip inside the final sixteenth. SHINE DOWN was prominent between horses but gave
way after three and a half furlongs. There was a stewards' inquiry into LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS' and LADY DI'S loss of action on the backstretch and the
rider of LADY DI lodged an objection alleging interference from SHINE DOWN near the half mile marker. After their review, the stewards did not uphold
LADY DI'S claim of foul against SHINE DOWN and the original finish stood.

Footnotes
ITALIAN CHARM settled outside, picked up his pace four wide on the bend, rallied under a drive in the lane, gained the lead nearing the sixteenth marker
and was drawing off in the waning yards. STUMP was sent to gain the early lead, challenged from outside on the turn, shook off GREAT GRET upper
stretch but lacked the extra needed inside the final furlong. CHERNYAHOVSKIY chased from just inside ITALIAN CHARM on the backstretch, followed that
one through the bend, was all out in the stretch and caught GREAT GRET for third late. GREAT GRET pressed the pace from outside, went for the lead on
the turn, floated out some entering the lane and gradually wore down. HELLOFAGUY crowded briefly leaving the chute, soon trailed, had the rail through
the bend, angled out three wide upper stretch, was closing the gap inside the final eighth and had to alter out through the waning yards looking for a clear
path. STEALIN' SUMMER in contention early, advanced two wide on the turn but flattened out between rivals for the stretch run. PEACOCK MAN was
steadied when his path disappeared at the end of the first furlong, recovered to be a factor from inside but gave way the final two furlongs. MUTAKDDIM
ROAD helped prompt the early pace but began to fade three wide before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
ARCTIC MUSIC soon sprinted clear of the rest, showed the way just off the inside, was under a mild drive in the lane and was clearly the best. ENCHILADA
chased from between rivals, was two wide on the bend, fanned outside BOOHOO SUE for the stretch run, was all out and caught the latter for second.
BOOHOO SUE raced closest to ARCTIC MUSIC from the beginning, in path three through the bend, was no match for that one when set down for the drive
and began to wear down deep stretch. LADY EXPRESS well back early, picked up her pace just off the inside on the turn, fanned three wide into the stretch
and showed late interest. TOUR ON chased from inside, came off the rail some leaving the bend, altered back to the rail upper stretch and also showed a
willingness to run the final furlong. KLONDIKE ANNIE chased from outside on the backstretch, angled in to be just off the inside on the turn, had the rail
leaving the quarter pole, floated out some into the stretch and had no late bid. JUKEBOX MONEY raced in midpack from outside for a half mile then gave
way. RUBY LEES SONG fractious in the gate before the start, came out bucking once the race began and lost her rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into
RUBY LEES SONG'S start but no action was taken after their review.
