Footnotes
FLIP MY ID brushed the near side stall at the start under coaxing, chased just off the inside just off a duel, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
went six wide into upper stretch, rallied coming inwards and seized command near the eighth pole, inched away to the finish kept to task. NO TIME ALONE
hustled from the gate, dueled from the two path with OUR TINY DANCER to her inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for
home, dug in under a drive briefly between rivals, then ran on to secure the place honors in the late stages. OUR TINY DANCER veered in at the break
forcing FLATTERY'S MAGIC to steady briefly, dueled inside of the aforementioned foe coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for
home, dug in under a drive and was collared a furlong out, kept on clear of the rest for the show honors. FLATTERY'S MUSIC steadied at the start briefly
when OUR TINY DANCER veered inwards, chased four wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung six wide for home and offered up a mild bid. UNI
LOVES A FIGHT three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. BEAUTIFUL BANKS was
taken in hand briefly just after the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and was outrun.

Footnotes
FEAST broke in and bumped with a foe, tugged at the bit under restraint while showing speed on the outside, powered away in the three then two path
when let out on the turn, was asked with a sizable advantage coming to the three-sixteenths, responded well when put to a right-handed crop into the final
furlong, switched to a left-handed crop into the final sixteenth and proved much the best under strong urging. LITTERBOX settled off the pace, was roused
while three then two wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a strong hand ride then moved into second position, came under the crop outside the
furlong marker and finished willingly for the place. EXTREME FORCE chased the pace on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, dropped back
into the stretch then steadied off heels around the three-sixteenths and came back to get the show while no match for the top two. MATTY'S MARAUDER
was bumped at the start, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged four then five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. MAGNIFICENT CHROME
settled off the pace, was urged along while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond.
POSSE CAN DISCO was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the inside of the winner, dropped back along the rail on the turn and retreated.

ORB IN THE TOWER was taken in hand early then a bit keen into the first turn, raced inside to the two path on that bend, settled more kindly on the
backstretch, went two then three wide on the far turn, was roused at the quarter-pole, rallied outside while put to a left-handed crop in upper stretch, closed
strongly to make a bid just inside the furlong marker, gained the lead just inside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. FLINTSHIRE'S ROCK
brushed with a foe at the start, went to the front, showed the way on the inside, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive,
kicked on strongly into the final furlong under threat from the runner-up, led determinedly into the final sixteenth then was overtaken while clear for the place.
EIGHT WEEKS LONG brushed with a rival at the start, moved in nearing the first turn, was reserved on the inside while held together under a snug hold,
saved ground on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came off the rail under a drive in upper stretch, bobbled outside the furlong marker and
lacked the needed response while clear for the show. WEBB was taken up while keen on the first turn, went two then three wide on that bend, raced on the
outside under some restraint, was let out while three then four wide on the far turn and came up empty. WICKED KARMA went four then three wide on the
first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.
MAJESTIC SKY was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, angled in at the rear of the field, traveled around in the first turn in the two path, settled at
the back, went four then five wide early on the far turn, dropped to the three path outside the quarter-pole and failed to threaten. Races with the rail setting
at 35 feet are hand timed.

Footnotes
AWESOME INDRA prompted the pace from the outside three then two wide, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched
on to the outside of SWEET MIA, had that rival drift out under a left handed crop and was herded two paths inside the eighth pole, dug in head to head
getting bumped with seventy yards to go as her main rival came out again under a left handed stick, then got brushed when gamely getting her nose up on
the wire to prevail. SWEET MIA established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from the aforementioned foe to the
outside, got roused spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under threat coming under a left handed crop and herded her main danger out inside the
eighth pole, came out again seventy yards from home bumping with AWESOME INDRA before brushing her at the finish when nailed on the wire.
MOSIENKO chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung two to three wide for home, dug in under a drive along the inside
of the top pair and missed at the end. STUNNING MUNNINGS three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into
upper stretch and improved position. BABY BOSS four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and
weakened in the late stages. MISS MI MI chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued along the inside into upper stretch,

Footnotes
GUFO was taken in hand early then moved in at the rear, saved ground on the opening bend, was unhurried at the rear of the field, was asked in the three
path early on the far turn then shifted five wide while roused for more at the five-sixteenths, rallied outside to take the lead into upper stretch, came in a bit
near the three-sixteenths then moved out, responded well in the final furlong and prevailed under steady urging. TIDE OF THE SEA went to the front, set
the clear pace on the inside, was asked outside the quarter-pole then came under the crop, lost the advantage into upper stretch, kept on in pursuit of the
winner in the final furlong and determinedly held the place. SHAMROCKET rounded the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, was roused in the
three path on the far turn, gained to make a bid into the stretch, fought on under a drive to the wire and just missed the place while clear for the show.
SADLER'S JOY was hustled leaving the gate, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, advanced four wide while let out on
the far turn, was roused for more at the five-sixteenths, made a bid into the stretch, steadied when GUFO came in near the three-sixteenths but was being
passed quickly by that foe, was steered out several paths shortly thereafter and weakened. RED KNIGHT saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off
the pace, drafted in the two path while pocketed on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths then paused while waiting behind horses coming to the
quarter-pole, shifted four wide into the stretch then moved further out while put to a drive, came further out nearing the furlong marker and lacked the
needed response. KINENOS moved up after breaking towards the rear of the field, was taken in hand nearing the wire for the first time then became a bit
keen under tight restraint, dropped in into the first turn, saved ground on that bend, was rated off the rail on the backstretch, came under urging in the two
path on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF SADLER'S JOY AGAINST GUFO

SISTER OTOOLE tracked the pace along the inside leading the main flight behind a pair of clear rivals, took closer order through the far turn coming under
urging five-sixteenths from home, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge in the final furlong taking command just outside the
sixteenth marker, then inched away in the late stages to prevail. HIGH OPINION two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, got set down
angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors in a blanket finish behind the winner. CREATIVE CAIRO saved ground
in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive between foes inside the final
furlong and surged late to procure the show honors. COMMUNITY ADJUSTED just off the inside tracking from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. WINDFALL PROFIT established the front and spurted away in hand just off the
inside through sensible splits, tucked inside half a mile from home, remained patiently handled until roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in
under threat inside the eighth pole and was collared just outside the sixteenth pole, then weakened in the late stages. PRAIRIE WINGS saved ground at the

Footnotes
FIRST CAPTAIN dropped back early then settled towards the rear, was urged along while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, rallied
outside to make a bid under a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker then took the advantage just inside that marker, disposed of the runner-up into
the final sixteenth and moved clear under a hand ride to prove best. RIDIN WITH BIDEN went clear early, set the an uncontested pace through sensible
fractions while in hand, controlled the action while inside through the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the
advantage while drifting just inside the furlong marker and was outfinished while able to hold the place. SNOW HOUSE settled comfortably on the outside,
went three wide on the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive into the final furlong, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and
was out-kicked while well clear for third. GERSHWIN tracked the pace under coaxing, chased in the two path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under a
strong hand ride, was put to the crop outside the quarter-pole and came up empty. CIVIL WAR settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn,
dropped back under the crop while three wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

JADES GELLY lunged from the gate, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking four then three wide through the turn, swung four
to five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take over command a furlong out and edged clear under a drive to the finish. CARTOUCHE coaxed from the gate,
showed the way in hand three paths off the inside, tucked briefly to the two path before making her way to the inside half a mile from home, remained
patiently handled through the turn and came under coaxing spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was displaced from the
front a furlong out, ran on to chase the winner home safe for the place honors. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH prompted the pace six paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn, got let out continuing three wide into upper stretch, dug in prominent to the eighth pole, then weakened in
the late stages. PROPER GRAMMAR eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked quickly to the two path nearing the half mile pole before taking
to the hedge inside that station, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and went three wide for home, weakened in the drive. DRAMATIC TWIST four
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn and got placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled six wide into
upper stretch and trailed throughout.
