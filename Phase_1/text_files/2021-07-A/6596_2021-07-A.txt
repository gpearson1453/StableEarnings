Footnotes
SIDNEY'S HOPE tracked off the leading pair early, saved ground on or just off the rail on the turn, bid inside MIGHTY OAKS MAGIC taking over just past
the sixteenth pole under a drive. MIGHTY OAKS MAGIC set the pace from outside, moved in to the three path leaving the backstretch, was clear on the turn
into upper stretch, was outkicked by the winner. SILENT ZENON tracked off the leaders and outside the winner, went in the four then three path on the turn,
kept on for show honors. SMART SPREE bumped the inner rival at the start, went two wide moving out four deep on the turn, ran on evenly. CAMINETTO
vied inside the runner-up, eased back and altered outside that one about the three-eighths, went four to five wide on the turn and failed to rally in the lane.
FULL OF DRIVE was bumped at the break, raced between rivals early, came out five wide on the turn, failed to rally. ROBTHEQUEEN lacked early speed,
went in the two to three path on the turn, passed tired rivals in the stretch. LAYCOCK BAY settled inside, altered outside foes at the quarter pole, continued
to move out fanning eight wide into the stretch and did not threaten. BOOMER WHO was in tight and shuffled back after the break, went in the five path into
the turn moving in to be three deep and failed to menace. CRUMAN TAPOTE failed to threaten racing outside six to seven wide. FOLLOWING THE RACE
THE RIDER OF CAMINETTO LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST MIGHTY OAKS MAGIC ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ON THE BACKSTRETCH BUT
UPON REVIEW BY THE STEWARDS NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
