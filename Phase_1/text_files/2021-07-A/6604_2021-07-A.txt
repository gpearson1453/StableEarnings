Footnotes
CEEKY set the pace inside of a pressing GOOD CLEAN FUN, dueled with that foe around the turn, then repelled that rival's bid approaching the furlong
grounds, and drew off. GOOD CLEAN FUN pressed the pace setter from the outside, dueled with that foe around the turn, but was repelled approaching the
furlong pole, and proved second best. SO CAUGHT UP IN U chased the leaders from the two path while under steady pressure to keep pace, then stayed
on through the lane to claim show without threatening the leaders. FEVOLA chased the leading duelers from the three path around the turn, and tired
through the lane. NORTHERN RANGER was outrun.

Footnotes
FLIPPANT stalked three wide early on, backed off to tuck to the two path into the second bend, shifted back out to produce a three wide bid for the lead
around the far turn, swept to the lead turning for home, took over entering the lane, and drew off under a mild drive. SCARABEA rated at the rear of the field
two wide, patiently awaited room turning for home, split foes at the furlong pole to bid for place inside of BALLOT INITIATIVE, dueled through the late stages
with that foe for that position, and prevailed determinedly. BALLOT INITIATIVE tracked from midpack along the inside, subtly shifted ground outwards to the
three path around the far turn while just behind the leading trio, shifted four wide in upper stretch after FLIPPANT drew off, claimed place passing the furlong
pole as SCARABEA bid to her inside for the same, but got outfinished. RUN WITH GRACE saved ground at the rear of the field, and improved through the
lane. SOMA set the pace along the inside, met a pair of bids around the far turn, proved no match for her outermost counterpart entering the lane, and
subsequently weakened. LISBOA pressed the pace two wide while a bit keen through the lane for the first time, vied between horses around the far turn,
proved no match for her outer counterpart entering the lane, and faltered between horses in midstretch. ROBIN'S FANTASY settled two wide, took the far
turn in the three to four paths, but faded turning for home.

COPPELIA pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, sustained a duel through upper stretch, then edged clear of her inner counterpart passing the
sixteenth pole. GIANNA'S GIFT set the pace along the inside, held an advantage from a vying COPPELIA around the far turn, shifted outwards and dug in
to continue the battle through upper stretch, but was bested passing the sixteenth pole. SEASIDE RETREAT stalked along the inside, but came under
coaxing passing the five sixteenths pole as the leading pair inched away, produced a mild response turning for home, but only managed to chase along the
rail through the lane, and failed to produce a bid. BOW BOW GIRL lied off of the pace in the two to three paths around the turns, and failed to factor.
HASHTAG WINNER trailed throughout while taking the turns in the in three to two paths, and failed to make an impact.

INTO THE SUNRISE dueled for the lead inside of FIELD DAY, disposed of that foe entering the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch as
UNITEDANDRESOLUTE gave chase, and safely held sway from that foe late. UNITEDANDRESOLUTE tracked the dueling pair two wide around the turn,
tipped outside of those foes entering the lane, chased INTO THE SUNRISE as that foe kicked clear in upper stretch, reached place passing the sixteenth
pole, and sustained a mild gain on the leader late. FIELD DAY dueled for the lead two wide, but proved no match for his inner counterpart entering the lane,
gave way in upper stretch, and lost place at the sixteenth pole. BOB'S EDGE lagged well behind the field around the turn, and stayed on through the lane to
cut the gap, but failed to threaten. BAYTOWN BEAR chased along the inside, swung four wide at the quarter pole to be outside of the leaders entering the
lane, but faded.

Footnotes
CHEFFY tucked to the rail in the latter half of the first turn before advancing to an inside stalking position into the backstretch, tracked the leading group
around the far turn, cut the corner turning for home and picked up stride in upper stretch, shifted three wide approaching the furlong grounds, and drove past
the leaders at the sixteenth marker. GLOBAL APPEAL prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses around the far turn as a pair of outer foes made
bids, forged an advantage entering the lane, repelled an outer flattening foe in upper stretch, but succumbed to CHEFFY's bid passing the sixteenth pole,
and proved second best. RARE STRIPE settled off of the pace two wide, rallied four wide into the far turn to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole,
forged a brief advantage passing the quarter pole, but was quickly headed turning for home, flattened out and was repelled in upper stretch, but kept on
thereafter to secure show. CASUAL AFFAIR set the pace along the inside, resisted a trio of bids entering the far turn, but was headed at the five sixteenths
pole, kept on through upper stretch, but gave way a sixteenth out. MAXIMUS AURELIUS broke slowly and trailed along the inside, took the far turn in the
two path, but failed to mount a rally. LOOTING pressed the pace three wide, but came under a drive into the far turn as RARE STRIPE made an outside bid,
got outkicked by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, then faded turning for home.

Footnotes
KNEESNHIPS saved ground off of the pace, slipped inside of foes in upper stretch after VIALETTO and MY DAWN got jump on her, sustained a rail rally to
bid inside of those rivals at the sixteenth pole, and forged an advantage a few strides from the wire. VIALETTO trailed two wide, produced an eye-catching
four wide field sweeping move turning for home to forge an advantage outside of MY DAWN in upper stretch, dueled thereafter as that foe dug in and
KNEESNHIPS produced a rail bid, but was bested by the latter approaching the wire. MY DAWN stalked the leading duelers from the three path around the
turn, inched closer to them at the five sixteenths pole to bid turning for home, vied between horses entering the lane as VIALETTO swept past, dug in after
being headed by that foe in upper stretch, sustained the duel into the final sixteenth as KNEESNHIPS produced a rail bid, but yielded late.
RUNNINGONTHETAFUEL settled off of the pace in the two path into the turn, but was outmoved by an outer rival turning for home, shifted five wide and
outside of the leading group in upper stretch, and stayed on well to chase them home. A LOT TO LIKE was reluctant to cross over onto the turf course, then
dueled for the lead outside of OUR LADY NELSON while kept in the three path into the turn, but was headed by a pair of outer foes entering the lane, and
weakened between horses in upper stretch. OUR LADY NELSON came out multiple paths at the start and carried outer foes wider, dueled for the lead
inside of A LOT TO LIKE while staying a path off of the rail into the turn, but weakened entering the lnae. ROSES FOR ASHLEY stalked along the inside,
but was outmoved by outer foe turning for home, found traffic while shifting ground outwards entering the lane, and faded thereafter.

HOZIER settled off of the pace, rallied four wide around the far turn to produce a bid outside of foes approaching the furlong grounds, dueled thereafter as
REGULAR GUY dug in, and edged away from that foe late. REGULAR GUY stalked three wide, bid for the lead approaching the furlong pole as HOZIER
ranged up alongside, dug in after being headed by that foe, but yielded late. SOL DEL SUR dueled for the lead two wide, but gave way to a pair of outer
foes at the furlong pole. VIOLENT PASS dueled for the lead along the inside, but weakened inside of a trio of foes at the furlong pole. GENTLE WARRIOR
tracked along the inside, but faded around the far turn. FORT KNOX lagged well behind the field throughout, and was outrun in a dull effort.
