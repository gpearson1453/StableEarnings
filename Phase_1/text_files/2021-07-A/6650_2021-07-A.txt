WE CAN DREAM dueled inside of LOOKING HOT, disposed of that foe after a half mile, then widened her advantage under driving pressure entering the
lane before being wrapped up late. BRENDA'S DOLL trailed into the far turn, then stayed on outside of tiring foes to claim place at the sixteenth pole.
LOOKING HOT dueled for the lead two wide, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart approaching the half mile pole, and weakened turning for
home. LITTLE GIRLS RULE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. KEEN'S SHOT broke outwardly, lied off of the pace in the three path around the
first turn, but was through after a half, and eased turning for home.

Footnotes
LUCKENBACHER set the pace along the inside, dueled inside of FREEDOMFI around the far turn after that foe made a bid, got headed approaching the
quarter pole, fought back to regain an advantage in upper stretch, then gamely denied a pair of outer bidding foes inside the final sixteenth, and edged a
margin approaching the wire. FREEDOMFI stalked two wide, bid for the lead approaching the half mile pole outside of LUCKENBACHER, vied with that foe
around the far turn, forged a very narrow advantage at the quarter pole, but was re-headed by his inner counterpart entering the lane as SILVER GALAXY
menaced as well, sustained the duel with his inner for after the outer flattened approaching the final sixteenth, but failed to change to his right lead, and
hung while getting outfinished. SILVER GALAXY tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted out to chase the dueling pair from the outside around the far
turn, inched closer to bid for the lead entering the lane, but drifted out inside the final furlong, and flattened out late. WHATDATPAY RAY settled off of the
pace in the three to two path around the first turn, commenced a mild rally turning for home outside of the leading trio, but failed to sustain that bid. JIMI'S A
STAR trailed four to three wide around the first turn, tucked to the rail down the backstretch and saved ground around the far turn, but failed to mount a rally.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE JEN was taken back from between horses early on to settle at the rear of the field, trailed into the far turn, but commenced a rally outside of foes
turning for home, circled the field five wide entering the lane, forged an advantage in upper stretch, and drew off under mild urging through the final furlong.
INNERVOICE rated off of the pace in the two path around the first turn, saved ground while outer foes made bids around the far turn, then stayed on
through the lane to split rivals three wide at the sixteenth pole to achieve place. LONE STAR SECRET set the pace along the inside of a rank and pressing
foe, met BELLA BELLE's bid around the far turn, repelled that rival entering the lane, but had little response for MY LITTLE JEN's surge in upper stretch,
then tired in the final furlong before losing place at the sixteenth pole. MAD TABBY stalked along the inside, saved ground, but failed to produce a bid.
BELLA BELLE tracked while hung five to four wide around the first turn, cleared inner foes under coaxing into the far turn to chase the leader two wide,
inched closer turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch. LIL HOT TODDY tracked from midpack two to three wide, but was outmoved by an outer
foe entering the lane, and failed to produced a bid thereafter. POSSE GONE WILD lied off of the pace in the three path, swung from the two path to the six
path entering the lane, but failed to rally outside of rivals. MINJI pulled uncontrollably through the field into the first turn after the rider lost her irons at the
start, vied outside of the pace setter while staying paths away, sustained vying position around the far turn, then weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
O CHITA broke sharply and set the pace from the onset, bet MOREWICKEDTHANLESSs bid at the five sixteenths pole, dueled inside of that foe turning for
home before shaking free in upper stretch, then drew off through the final furlong. MOREWICKEDTHANLESS stalked three wide into the turn, ranged up
outside of the leader at the five sixteenths pole, dueled turning for home, but was repelled in upper stretch, then safely held place. ANITA'S VISION was
hustled along the inside to chase the leading pair around the turn, then held show through the lane without progressing on the top two. EASY IS GOOD
lunged outwards at the start when she bobbled behind at the start, tracked from off of the pace while four wide around the turn, then only managed to chase
through the lane without producing a bid. FAITHFUL AUSTIN chased the pace two wide and from between horses early on, but steadily faded. QUEEN
KINLEY was outrun. The three furlong time is unavailable.

Footnotes
LIL ALLIE DANCER tracked the pace three wide, shifted four wide turning for home while commencing a rally, drove past the leader approaching the
sixteenth pole, and drew clear thereafter. LOVE AND LEMONS chased from the two path, then from between horses turning for home, but was outmoved
by her outer counterpart entering the lane, kept on thereafter to bid for place inside of MAJESTIC EDGE inside the final furlong, and prevailed for that
position on the wire. MAJESTIC EDGE set the pace while staying a path off of the rail around the turn, shifted a path further outwards to meet LIL ALLIE
DANCER's bid in midstretch, but proved no match for that foe passing the sixteenth pole, dueled for place outside of LOVE AND LEMONS thereafter, but
was outfinished by that rival. GOODNIGHT GRACIE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. ALTERED DREAM stalked outside of the leader while in
the three path around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch, then faded on his left lead. BAYLOR was outrun.

Footnotes
PRINCESA ANN tracked from midpack, took the far turn three to four wide, rallied outside of the leaders to drive past them at the sixteenth pole, and drew
clear. MISS CHECKMARK stalked two wide, steadily progressed on the clear leader in upper stretch as PRINCESA ANN did the same, bid for the lead
passing the quarter pole along with that foe, but got outkicked. MERLIN'S SISTER saved ground far off of the pace, shifted three wide in upper stretch, and
stayed on for a minor share. STORMY SUNRISE stayed in the six path around the first turn while in midpack, shifted to the four path into the far turn, yet
somehow managed to stay on outside of foes through the lane. CLOUDYWITHACHANCE established a clear margin early on, but met a pair of bids in
midstretch, and weakened passing the sixteenth pole. WHISKEY TO WINE got caught four wide far off of the pace around the first turn, cleared inner foea
and saved ground around the far turn, but lacked a rally through the lane. BIG SUZE stalked along the inside, chased around the far turn, and faded in
upper stretch. KARAT MAMA bumped with an outer foe soon after the start and trailed the field early on, took the turns in the three to five path, but bolted to
the outer railing in upper stretch, and failed to mount a rally. THIRTEEN LIES failed to factor. JULIE'S GHOST got fractious in the gates before they opened,
then never got involved.
