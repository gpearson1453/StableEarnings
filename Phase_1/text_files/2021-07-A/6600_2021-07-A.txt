pace, moved out inside the three-quarter pole, ranged up three wide on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under the

three wide on the opening bend, lagged at the rear of the field, moved from three to six wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response while along for
the show. TARIFF WAR broke in and bumped with a foe, showed speed in the three path on the first turn, moved to the lead early on the backstretch,
showed the way with some company to his inside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked under threat outside the quarter-pole, dropped back into
upper stretch and capitulated. L'ARTISTE bumped hard with a foe after the start then was taken in hand, went four wide on the initial turn, was reserved
towards the back, went two then three wide on the far turn, was roused around the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the crop and failed to
threaten. HOOPLA bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed on the inside, prompted the pace along the rail, was coaxed along passing the half-mile

ALPINE QUEEN five then four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn and advanced on the leader to take
command just inside the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under challenge coming out slightly a furlong out, then gamely fended off her
main rival to the finish. STRONG POINT coaxed from the gate, raced four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking along the inside through the
turn, came under coaxing and tipped out to swing four wide into upper stretch, rallied to bid for command a furlong out and was herded very slightly at that
juncture, dug in drifting out inside that station and was repelled to the wire. RHYTHM AND POWER established the front and showed the way in hand three
then two wide down the backstretch before tucking inside into the turn, came under challenge for the initial time nearing the three-eighths pole and yielded
the front inside that station, took the inside route into upper stretch now giving chase and weakened through to the finish.

Footnotes
COUNT DOWN displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was asked just inside the quarter-pole, easily shook
off PONT OF HUMOR as that rival faltered in upper stretch, drew off into the final furlong and proved much the best under strong urging. LOADED JOE
settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished willingly for the place. UNCLE MO'S CAT settled
towards the back of the field, saved ground on the turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, moved out around the three-sixteenths and improved
position to get the show. RAISING SAND settled towards the rear of the field, was roused in the two path on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper
stretch and improved position without threatening. RYE RUNNER was rated just off the pace on the inside, saved ground on the turn, dropped back under
urging in upper stretch and came up empty. CONGRATS FOR GLORY was rated just off the pace then let out in the two path on the turn, came under
encouragement outside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and had nothing left. POINT OF HUMOR tracked the pace on the outside, vied
in the two path on the turn, dropped back quickly in upper stretch and faltered. RUN SMITTY RUN bumped with a rival at the start, settled towards the rear
on the outside, went two to three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, was forced out near the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten.
BECKENBAUER was corrected with the left rein at the start then hustled, raced on the outside under urging, went four wide on the turn and capitulated.
MOONSHININGBRIGHT bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the far outside, dropped back five wide on the turn and faltered. KENTUCKY KNIGHT
acted-up just before the gate opened and came out extremely far behind the rest of the field as the rider was caught unprepared, had the rider lose his right
iron before regaining it prior to going a sixteenth, fell well behind and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
BUSTIN BAY chased three then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, rallied to take command near the eighth
pole and edged clear under a drive to prevail. CAUSE TO DREAM broke through the gate prior to the start and was reloaded, chased six then five wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and ran on to chase the winner home clear for the place honors. TAKE IT OFF
hustled from the gate, dueled from the two path with FEYRE to her inside, shook off that rival with seven-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under threat and was collared near the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages while preserving the show honors. MAGICALLYDELICIOUS
chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for
home and improved position through the stretch. LOVE ME TOMORROW chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the three-eighths, came under
coaxing at that station, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. GAGLIANO got away to an awkward beginning getting away
last and breaking inwards to brush with CLASSY SADIE, chased just off the inside down the backstretch before going four to five wide through the turn,
cornered five wide for home and passed tired rivals in the stretch. CLASSY SADIE brushed at the start by the aforementioned foe, chased six paths off the
inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. BLUE PAYNT fractious
in the gate prior to the start just after CAUSE TO DREAM broke through the gate to her inside, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. FEYRE hustled from the gate, dueled inside of TAKE IT OFF from the get go, got
shaken off with seven-sixteenths remaining, faded through the turn and continued in the inside route into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
FIYA strolled to the front, showed the way through slow fractions on an uncontested lead, controlled the action while inside on the turn, responded well
when set down in upper stretch, braced for the challenge of the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole then was put to a right-handed crop and held gamely
under strong urging. PULSATE was rated just off the pace, drafted inside while on hold on the turn, tipped into the two path while asked into upper stretch,
accelerated in pursuit of the winner, chased that foe into the final furlong, was put to a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, made a bid into the final
sixteenth but was denied while clear for the place. MAXWELL ESQUIRE settled at the rear of the field, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two
path, was roused while swinging five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. BATTLE STATION stalked the pace on the outside, came
under coaxing in the two path on the turn, was given his cue at the quarter-pole then chased the winner, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened.
REUX (GB) was reserved on the outside, went two then three wide on the turn, was asked while spinning four wide into the stretch and came up empty.
Races with the rail setting at 35 feet are hand timed.

ORIGINAL established the front and showed the way well rated along the inside through sensible splits uncontested, got given some rein to work with inside
the five-sixteenths and began to shake away, spun just off the inside into upper stretch set down for the drive, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole,
dug in under threat and held gamely to prevail. PUBLIC SECTOR (GB) rated two then three wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five
wide into upper stretch, closed well through the final furlong to threaten late and missed at the end. STRAW INTO GOLD rated tracking along the inside,
tipped to the two path three furlongs from home and came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, offered up a
mild bid. IT'S A GAMBLE just off the inside under rating in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home
and weakened in the late stages. ANNEX saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing tipped to two path at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide
into upper stretch and offered no kick. HOT BLOODED rated three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper

Footnotes
MIND CONTROL was asked for speed leaving the gate, disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, came under a drive in upper
stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up under a right-handed crop in the final furlong and gamely prevailed under strong urging. FIRENZE FIRE displayed
good speed, contested the pace on the inside of MIND CONTROL, was put to a drive in upper stretch, dueled inside the aforementioned foe under a
left-handed crop in the final furlong and just missed while clear for the show. THREE TECHNIQUE was rated off the pace, drafted in the two path on the
turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came under the crop turning into the stretch, chased under a drive while behind the leading duo, moved out from
behind those foes into the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. TOP SEED settled nicely on the outside, ranged up four wide on the turn, was
given his cue at the five-sixteenths, chased outside into the final furlong, was carried out some at that point and out-kicked. WICKED TRICK broke a step
slow, moved in at the rear of the field, settled along the rail, shifted out leaving the backstretch, angled from the two path to the four path on the turn, was
driven into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. AMERICAN POWER settled just off the pace, went around the turn in the three path, dropped
back while crowded a touch near the three-eighths then came under strong urging, spun four wide into the stretch and had nothing left.
