Footnotes
FIRST PROMISE away quickly to begin, cleared inside rival and moved down to the two path, pressured into the stretch, turned away foe under
right-handed urging and remained clear to the wire. TALKATIVE GAL broke well then ceded the lead to FIRST PROMISE and switched outside that rival,
bid three wide leaving the turn, could not match the winner in the lane but proved second best. SMART MONIQUE stumbled at the start, entered the turn
two wide, moved out to the four path around the bend and churned on for a clear third. PEARLS AND HEELS stalked the pacesetter outside a rival, traveled
four wide around the turn and weakened. BIG ROSIE broke slow and came in leaving the gate, trailed the field along the inside then two wide into the
stretch and proved no menace. HALF-MILE WAS HAND-TIMED.

PLATINUM EQUITY dueled for the lead from inside, vied with rivals in the final furlong and held gamely. QUESTION AUTHORITY broke in and bumped
rival at the start, went four then five wide around the turn, came with a late bid but could not get by the winner. ADMIRAL BOOM stalked two into the turn,
eased out into the three path leaving the bend, bid outside the top pair in the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. MALAKAI MOXIE dueled for the lead
from outside to the eighth pole and weakened late. ROYAL SEEKER bobbled, bumped, and was a bit rank between horses at the start, traveled four wide
through the turn and could not rally. TIZ LOVE chased off the inside, pulled up by the rider on the turn, eventually stopping near the eighth pole and walked

INTENSE brushed with inside rival leaving the gate, was closest in pursuit to the stretch, drew alongside with a sixteenth remaining and proved best late.
SURPLUS got bumped leaving the gate then sped clear, set all the pace to the stretch, led clear into the furlong grounds but could not fend off the winner.
PICK YOUR BID raced off the pace early on, traveled five to six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and gained the show. GORDY'S BOY
tracked off the rail, went four wide into the turn, exited the bend five wide and finished evenly late. LARRY'S LEGEND chased in the two path then drifted
four wide around the bend and weakened. MOON CIRCUMFERENCE broke out and bumped rival, went two wide into the turn, three wide into the stretch
and came up empty.

Footnotes
HOT PASTRAMI displayed good early foot to establish the front, pressured by PEDRO PEREZ around the turn, maintained a short lead into the drive,
cleared that rival mid-stretch then met the bid from EXTREMELY WICKED at the eighth pole and inched away to prove best. EXTREMELY WICKED chased
along the fence to the stretch, bid inside the winner at the eighth pole, faltered late but saved the place. PEDRO PEREZ stalked the pace from outside, bid
alongside at the seven-sixteenths, lost contact mid-stretch and stayed on to just miss the place. CHARMING DANZA was in range early, dropped back
around the turn, entered the stretch three wide and weakened. MAUI ROAD got bumped hard from outside leaving the gate, drifted five wide on the turn and
failed to response when asked. WARHORSE MATTY broke in and bumped MAUI ROAD hard at the start, got carried six wide by that rival around the turn
and was never a factor.

Footnotes
VERY IRISH got bumped leaving the gate, stalked the pacesetter early then went up to apply pressure on the backstretch, grabbed the lead at the
three-sixteenths, kicked clear mid-stretch and held safely. MY INDY stalked the top pair outside a rival, came three wide into the lane, finished willingly
outside MOON MISCHIEF and won the battle for the place honors. MOON MISCHIEF stalked in the two path on both turns, tipped out in the drive and got
outkicked for second. DERBY CHAMP broke out and bumped rival at the start, took control quickly, pressured on the backstretch, lost command while
drifting in at the three-sixteenths and weakened. SIR FLATTER was off slow from outside, went four wide through both turns and failed to rally. GLENDORA
MINECAT hit the outside of the gate to come away a bit slow, settled off the pace, saved ground through the far turn but lacked the needed response in the
drive. PASSING THE BUCK was off slow to begin, trailed throughout and was always outrun.

NEUTRINO settled off the rail, navigated the turn three wide, tipped outside the top pair in the lane, put in a late bid with a sixteenth remaining and
overhauled the runner-up. PAINT ME LUCKY stalked outside a rival, loomed three wide into the stretch, drew alongside then struck the front mid-stretch,
cleared briefly but got overtaken in the final moments. HOT PURSUIT set the pace under pressure from inside, cleared rival at the three-eighths,
relinquished command mid-stretch and weakened late. HONORARY DEGREE tracked five wide through the bend and kept on to earn a minor award.
SQUARE ROOT chased in the two path to the stretch and weakened. LITTLE MISCHIEF broke inward while away quickly, pressed the pace from inside,
lost contact at the three-eighths pole and weakened. W. WHITEHOUSE traveled in the two path and made no impact. SIR WILLIAMS DREAM went four
wide around the turn and was never a factor.

for the place. EDGEWAY broke slow and bumped inner rival twice at the start, went up to press the pace from inside, headed rival nearing the turn, could
not keep pace around the bend and weakened in the late stages. QAHIRA got bumped twice by EDGEWAY at the start, tracked from inside into the turn,

Footnotes
ESKIMO ROSES was off alertly to begin, set the pace outside BABY GRONK, cleared into the turn, led two wide into the stretch, kept to task with
right-handed urging and stayed strong to the wire. BABY GRONK knocked into rival leaving the gate, went up to force the issue from inside, could not match
strides with the winner into the turn, chased three wide into the stretch and held the place. TYRANNICAL REX got bumped start the start, trailed early, raced
off the rail then angled in to save ground around the turn, produced a mild rally and earned the show. CASH ENCOUNTER was along the inside into the
turn, moved to the two path around the bend, summoned a mild rally and filled out the superfecta. GREAT POWER broke in and bumped rival, traveled
widest early, went five wide into the bend, seven wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. COIL TO STRIKE knocked into rival at the start, tracked three to
four wide through the turn and weakened in the lane. TWO BILLS chased four to five wide while outside rivals on the turn and also weakened.
