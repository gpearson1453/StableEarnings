Footnotes
SOCIAL EQUALITY settled early, bid after half a mile, took over nearing the quarter pole and rapidly drew away under moderate urging. FOX IN THE FOG
chased inside, faded on the backstretch then came again for the place. BESTER lagged far behind then closed the gap for show. PRINCE CHAMP saved
ground close up then began faltering after five furlongs. MR. TUTTLE moved clear inside, widened down the backstretch, was collared and gave way.
DIGGING FOR GOLD chased wide on the first turn, remained wide and was no factor. PRINCIPINO dropped far behind and weakened steadily losing
contact with his field..

Footnotes
LIL MISS HOTSHOT pressed the pace outside, led into the far turn then steadily drew away under light coaxing. CANOOCHEE angled three wide after a
quarter mile, continued willingly but was no match for the winner. CHANCEE hustled to the front inside, was collared into the far turn and faded.
FLORENCIA rated off the leaders, moved wide in the stretch and failed to threaten. MOLLY'S GAME moved closer inside after half a mile and faded.
TOWSON steadied along in the opening quarter, was rank on the final turn far back. PASSPORT REQUIRED lacked speed and gave way readily.

JAYJAYDEE led under pressure inside, began widening on the final turn and remained safe driving. ROAN MOUNTAIN stalked the pace inside, angled out
in the stretch to challenge the pacesetter, bid but was no match for the winner. SILVER EDGE raced just off the leaders three wide, moved extremely wide
in the stretch. HEART OF A DREAMER lacked speed near the inside, moved out on the final turn then flattened. OCCHI D'ORO broke out at the start,
rushed outside and faded on the final turn. IMPACTFUL dropped back outside, was asked for run into the far turn but had no response. GRAND OASIS
dropped well behind and trailed throughout.
