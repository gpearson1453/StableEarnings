Footnotes
FERLIN HUSKY stalked the pace pressing to draw even on the turn wresting a narrow lead near mid track in upper stretch holding on gamely to the wire.
MY TOMMY BOY slow early lost ground to upper stretch responding late bidding gamely in the seven path. UNCLE HAL chased the pace drawing closer on
the turn, loomed in the six path down the lane hanging late. OLD MOUNTAIN LANE chased early then dropped off on the turn racing evenly in the three
path down the lane. CAJUN CHAOS pressed early then chased to upper stretch weakening under a drive. AMACE slow early was no menace racing inside
down the lane. THE KIPPY TRAIN pressed a narrow lead through the turn weakening on the rail the final eighth. EL GORDO NAVAS played no factor.
SLEWS LOVE was never involved.
