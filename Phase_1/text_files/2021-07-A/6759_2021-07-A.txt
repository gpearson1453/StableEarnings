BAKKEN THE SUN settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, tipped three wide entering the
lane, and assumed command in mid stretch and quickly drew clear. KAPALUA CANDY away well and dueled for the lead one out from the rail in the run
down the backstretch, continued to force the issue through the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, was no match for the winner late, but
battled gamely to prove second best. ARIKARA away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run
down the backstretch and through the final turn, struggled to keep tabs on her pace rival entering the lane, and was outfinished late. COUNTESS CAT broke
sharply, but settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished
with some late interest in deep stretch. C R SUNRISE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to
make a serious late impact. ONE FLEET PRINCESS was squeezed soon after the start, and settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon.

BE QUICK away alertly and tracked the leader one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to bid his time from a tracking position in the
run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, took a narrow lead into the stretch, and inched clear late. UNCHARACTERISTIC broke
sharply and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and
closed two out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place. SMART LAD rushed up three wide to gain the lead from the rail entering the first turn,
dictated the pace through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch, battled from along the rail entering the final turn, was overtaken entering the
lane, but finished with late interest from along the rail in deep stretch to just miss the place. BLUEPRINT away well and stalked the leader two wide from
between rivals entering the second turn, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but was outfinished in the late stages. WHISKEY TALK stalked the
leader from along the rail through the stretch the first time, dropped back to trail in the run down the backstretch, and had nothing to offer late.

MARTELLO broke sharply and pressed the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, battled for the lead two wide entering the final turn,
took control leaving the turn, and quickly drew clear. DEMERARA away alertly and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the first turn, set
a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with the winner leaving the turn, but
finished willingly from along the rail to prove second best. ACE DEUCE stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along
the inside entering the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to garner a share. TORINO GRAND away well and tracked the leaders from
along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, and closed three out from the rail in the
drive. SPOKANE'S GEM tracked the leaders two wide entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive.
HIGHWAY BOSS unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three out from the rail entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon.
WICKED FORTITUDE settled off the early pace while racing four wide in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon. ONE LAST HIT stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, dropped back in the
run down the backside, and failed to respond when called upon.

CUZZN DOUG away alertly and tracked the leader one out from the rail through the lane the first time, maintained his position in the run down the
backstretch, battled for the lead two wide through the final turn and into the lane, took a narrow advantage in deep stretch, and was all out to fend off GUNS
N AMMO in the final strides. GUNS N AMMO broke sharply and stalked the leaders from along the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his
position in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed steadily to just miss. BOLD AS
BRASS away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace into the backstretch, battled for the lead from the
inside of CUZZN DOUG through the final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival late, while finishing at the rail. WE'RE IN COMMAND unhurried
early while dropping back to trail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive. JOHNNY settled off the early
pace while racing one out from the rail entering the lane the first time, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing three wide
in the drive. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of GUNS N AMMO lodged a claim of foul against the rider of
CUZZN DOUG, for alleged interference entering the first turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of
finish

at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, and finished with late interest while improving his position from along the
inside in the stretch drive. STONERIDGE AMBER brome sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from
along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with her pace rival leaving the turn, and was outfinished
late. AS REQUIRED stalked the leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing

gain a stalking trip two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded late. SUMMER QUEST settled off the
early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, struggled to maintain her position in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer over the final
furlong.
