Footnotes
HOUSE ARREST set the pace on the inside, was pressed some on the backside, showed the way on the far turn, responded when asked at the top of the
lane and pulled away. PLATO bobbled at the break, raced three wide early, stalked three wide, moved up four wide at the half mile marker, rallied outside
on the far turn and dug in gamely in the stretch drive to hold second. PAINTER'S PRIDE trailed the field, advanced on the far turn, rallied mildly outside and
missed for second. GIO D'ORO raced off the pace inside, chased three wide on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, bid and was outkicked. HEART
OF A DREAMER tracked close up on the inside, two wide at the half mile marker, chased inside on the far turn and faded. AMERICA'S SIMMARD was off
slowly, raced four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace and did not factor. NEW MEXICO stalked between rivals, moved up three wide at the half mile
marker, then gave way.

win. A GIRLS BESTFRIEND raced off the pace inside, then two wide on the backside, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied in the stretch and surged
late to get up for second. BIG RED ROCKS vied inside for the lead, dueled with BROWN ESSENCE on the far turn, battled with that rival through the lane,
dug in gamely on the rail and got the nod for third. BROWN ESSENCE vied two wide for the lead, dueled two wide on the far turn, dug in gamely between
rivals in deep stretch and just missed for second. JUAN BOLY raced three wide early, stalked three or two wide, saved ground on the far turn and closed
mildly on the rail in the lane. PAWNBROKER raced three wide early, settled two wide off the pace, moved up at the quarter pole and closed mildly. KING
