Footnotes
FOOL YOURSELF was taken three wide early, edged up outside rivals mid way through the backstretch run to track the pace, bid three wide outside to
tackle PRINECESS DOIR past the five sixteenths, secured command under a drive past the three sixteenths then steadily widened through the final furlong
while kept to a steady hand ride. PRINECESS DOIR , off slowly when breaking inward and bumping with INDIAN NICHOLS, regrouped and pulled her way
forward around the first turn, prompted the pace two wide, moved to a slim lead after six furlongs, dueled with the winner from the quarter pole to mid stretch
then gave way grudgingly. OIL ON CANVAS rated between foes while in range entering the backstretch, came under a ride two wide leaving the far turn,
remained a serious presence to the top of the lane but failed to seriously kick on. INDIAN NICHOLS , bumped at the break, vied outside of ENTER
SANDWOMAN into the first turn, dropped in after clearing and set the pace towards the rail, handled outside pressure through the backstretch run, stayed
on to about upper stretch then weakened. ENTER SANDWOMAN flashed speed inside, rated off the leaders and stalked along the rail past the five eighths,
failed to go on leaving the far turn and faltered.

UP FOR THE CHANCE hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace the entire trip and narrowly prevailed in a determined effort. HEAVENLY TRIP , forwardly
placed in the three path between horses around the turn, challenged for the lead approaching the eighth pole, dueled with the winner and just missed.
SLAATS , rank when breaking awkwardly, circled the turn, was fanned six deep in upper stretch and rallied. EPIC RISE lacked speed, was angled to the five
path turning for home and failed to be a factor. KING SABAN showed speed in the two path between horses and weakened in upper stretch. A LOT LIKE
XMAS , four deep disputing the pace to the stretch, gave way.

JOYFUL NOISE rated behind foes early on, saved ground leaving the far turn, angled three wide with run into the lane, dropped back in with continued
momentum leaving mid stretch, bid to the inside of RAVENEL leaving the sixteenth pole, took over late and held firm under a drive. RAVENEL , well placed
inside and just off the contested pace, eased out under rating mid turn, bid four wide to command in upper stretch, spurted clear under pressure in mid
stretch, dug in when meeting a bid to her inside, kept on gamely and missed. SARAH'S TREASURE lagged well back leaving the far turn, gathered some
steam in upper stretch, split rivals past the furlong grounds but found her best run too late. DAT DARES GOLD flashed speed, was rated back leaving the
five eighths, stalked outside a rival, shifted four to five wide and came up empty. CALYPSO GHOST bid outside I'M SO MUNNY in the opening furlong and
got engaged in a duel, battled around the turn and held a short lead nearing the lane, stayed on to about the three sixteenths then weakened. I'M SO
MUNNY broke sharp and secured a short early advantage, was engaged after a furlong, dueled to upper stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
ZIG pulled her way to the fore in the opening furlong, set a rated pace two wide while handling some outside pressure, opened up after being set down in
upper stretch then steadily increased her advantage while kept to task. JENNA THE BOSS prompted the pace three wide outside the winner, was put to a
solid ride after a half mile, failed to keep pace leaving the three sixteenths but but continued with effort to the wire. RONOMES rated off the pace while
saving ground, eased out in upper stretch, split rivals inside the furlong grounds and kept on willingly. HOT CHOICE settled in mid pack while saving ground
early, angled out leaving the far turn, circled four wide into the stretch but lacked a solid kick. MYSTIC COMIN HOME flashed speed, dropped in around the
turn, gave hard chase into the stretch and faded. BUST OUT LADY , bumped and pinched back at the break, raced well back leaving the half mile pole,
came three wide for the drive but lacked a rally. SUNDAY IN L B C bore out the break, bothering BUST OUT LADY, pursued two wide and faltered after a
half mile.

Footnotes
WONDER IN circled the turn chasing FORCED, was bumped by that one inside the sixteenth pole, was carried out by that rival and determinedly prevailed.
GOING TO THE LEAD , off the rail around the turn, swung wide in upper stretch, rallied outside horses and was floated out late. FORCED , quickly clear,
set the pace slightly off the rail, gave way grudgingly and drifted out bumping the winner approaching the wire. DAY THE MUSIC DIED , rank leaving the
starting gate, swung four wide turning for home and failed to menace. BATTLEBUS stumbled leaving the starting gate, raced in the three path on the turn
and was not a factor. CANDYGRAMFORMONGO raced along the inner rail and was not a factor. An objection by the rider of GOING TO THE LEAD against
the winner for alleged interference in deep stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
SAMMIE SUNSHINE was sent to the front heading into the first turn, dropped in and set a pressured pace, shook clear under a light hold and repelled
challenges leaving the five sixteenths, opened up under a drive in mid stretch and was kept to pressure to late. RAG TOP broke sluggishly, settled off of a
contested pace, came four wide for the drive and finished up willingly to nab the place. NANA'S SHOES rated outside a foe early on, gained under asking
past the five sixteenths, came four wide for the drive and flattened out late. BRING ME ANSWERS , well placed tracking a contested pace, moved up under
a ride three wide past the five sixteenths, chased into the lane and faded. OLIVE'S BUMPA was outrun. SIMMARD SHENANIGAN was used early, vied
outside the winner into the backstretch, remained a presence past the three eighths and weakened.
