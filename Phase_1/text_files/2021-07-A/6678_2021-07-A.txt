Footnotes
ORO AZTECA was off to an alert start to clear at once, continued on a clear lead into the lane while in the two path then widened through the lane when
asked. ON THE RAYDAR chased the winner from the three path through the turn and into the lane, could not gain and settled for second best while well
clear of the next rival. MOTION TO ADJOURN raced in the two or three path through the turn and could only manage to save the distant show spot. KILLER
HOTROD trailed through the turn while in the two path then improved late. LAGUNA BEACH was in the three path through the turn and never was a factor.
TAKECHARGEJUSTICE raced along the inside through the turn and into the lane while a contender then was empty after straightening in the lane.

and had nothing after entering the lane. The three-quarter time was omitted due to a timer malfunction.

EVERYOTHERWON vied for the lead two wide down the backstretch, cleared into the turn, widened through the turn and into the lane, was still clear with
an eighth to go and was all out to last. JUSTA SIMPLE GIRL chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path
with aim on the leader, steadily gained on that one and just missed at the wire. CECILIA'S HOPE was in the three path through the turn, swung into the lane
from the four path, lacked a closing kick but stayed on well to be clear for the show spot. WHISTLIN' DIXIE saved ground through the turn and into the lane
and offered a mild gain while moving up a couple of spots. KHUSHBU was never a threat while in the two path through the turn and coming into the lane
from the five path. BLU VIXEN vied for the early lead while along the inside, chased the winner into the lane then faded.

Footnotes
BERTIE THE BEAUTY chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, was in the four path while gaining on the leader through the turn, came into the
lane from the eight path and edged up late. LITTLE MAEMI pressed the pace while two wide into the turn, took over in mid-turn while coming further off the
inside, entered the lane from the seven path with the lead, then yielded near the sixteenth pole. CRYPTO CAT was far back early while in the three path,
moved quickly through the turn to move into contention, continued with energy into the lane and rallied from the three path. EMBROILED was in the two or
three path through the turns, came into the lane and finished evenly. RHAPSODY IN GREY set the pace along the inside into the far turn then gave way.
IMA N H LADY CAT was checked sharply early when squeezed between rivals, raced along the inside through the turns and moved up while not a threat.
FUN KEY TOWN was never a factor while near the rail. MISS DONNASUE was in the two path through the turns when in mid-pack and was empty turning
into the lane. AMA LUCY chased the pace along the inside into the turn, and was done at the three-eighths pole. LILMISS SASSYPANTS steadily faded
while racing in the three path through the turns. TWO LUCKY chased the pace from the three or four path into the backstretch, was done entering the far
turn and was eventually eased to the wire and walked off. SEXY PORK CHOP was far back throughout and eventually eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
JOYRUNNER bid five wide at the quarter pole, rallied at the sixteenth pole and was in time under mild urging. CHOPIN DRIVE raced inside, angled four
wide at the top of the stretch, shifted back to the two path for running room, rallied and just missed. MARIAH'S FORTUNE raced in the six path early, ran
three wide around the turn, bid late on the turn, rallied four wide in the stretch but was caught. EMILY SMILES stalked the pace between foes, angled three
wide at the top of the stretch, bid but couldn't hold off the closers. GOLDEN SIGHTS stalked inside, bid in early stretch, vied, led late but was outfinished.
GRATZ PARK stalked the pace in the three path but lacked a late bid. STELLA TERESA was quickly clear, then couldn't last. QUEST FOR GOLD was not
a factor.
