Footnotes
ZAHRA sat just off of the early pace, made a middle move nearing the half-mile marker to confront WITH OPEN EYES, dueled with that one along the
second turn and put that rival away into the stretch and drew off in the final sixteenth to win as much the best. WITH OPEN EYES set the pace through the
backstretch and was confronted by the winner nearing the half-mile pole, dueled with ZAHRA through the second turn while three wide but lost ground into
the stretch and was tiring late but held on to save second. VALRAVN bobbled at the start and was outrun in the early stages, saved ground on the second
turn while launching a bid inside of the quarter-pole but was outfinished by the top two in the stretch while a clear third over the rest. TALE OF THE
TAVERN stalked the early pace, lost ground on the second turn while on the rail and gave out in the stretch run. MARNAYS QUEEN prompted the pace
through the backstretch, lost ground on the run into the second turn, was four wide on the second turn and faded in the stretch drive. PROJECT LOGIC was
four to five wide on the first turn, was unhurried in the early stages, was outrun into the second turn and stopped, was eased, and walked off. The one mile
split was omitted.
