GLITTER MOUNTAIN set the pace, took command on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was much the best. P S CHARLIE BROWN
settled off the pace, closed the gap on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for place. GIDEON'S SWORD forced the pace and
was a factor on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. WALKINAROUNDMONEY tracked the leaders from the inside and
was roused on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no response.

LOADED ONCE MORE stumbled at the start, moved up on the turn and with the lead in mid stretch proved best. CAREFUL JAVA was off slow, gained
ground on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch rallied late. ABOVE THE LINE tracked the leaders from the inside and raced evenly on
the turn but from the six path through the stretch needed more. DOODLE DANDY was well back, hustled along on the turn and from the three path at the
top of the stretch passed tired foes. ONLY BELIEVE forced the pace and was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off.
PLAY IT SMART set a pressured pace and had the lead on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. WONDERFUL SOFIA was
off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was no threat.

Footnotes
KEEP GOING stalked the early leader, was a factor on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch drew clear. CAUSE FOR ALARM was
hustled early and had the lead on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. BADDEST BLUES was well back,
moved up on the far turn and from the three path through the stretch was the best of the rest. ICE BLUE was off the pace and had a mild gain on the far turn
but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. GIANTBALLS OF FIRE had no speed and was roused on the far turn but from the six path at the
top of the stretch had no response. CHEETAHRA was in range early but chased on the far turn and was empty. A VIKING MORNING was in touch early but
lost ground on the far turn and was outdistanced.

FREE SPEECH stalked the early leader, dueled on the turn and from the six path through the stretch fought gamely for the win. JACK BEANSTALK was
hustled early and had a slim lead on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. KUDURO settled off the leaders,
was roused on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. SOFIA'S SLUGGER showed no speed and raced evenly on the
turn but had no rally. TIME TO DANCE was off slow, chased on the turn and was no real threat. BOBBI'S LEGACY was well back, showed nothing and was
never in contention.

LIL'S TURN was in range, roused on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch proved best. ROMANTIC BLISS was in touch, a factor on the
turn and had the lead from the six path in mid stretch but was outgunned. SHAMRUCKUS was away alertly and had the lead on the turn but from the five
path at the top of the stretch gave way. SILENT CHARITY was unhurried early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the
stretch needed more. JACK'S MEMORY was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but had no kick. I HAVE FEELINGS was hustled early but chased
on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. AFLEET CONNECTION was well back, showed nothing and from the six path at the
