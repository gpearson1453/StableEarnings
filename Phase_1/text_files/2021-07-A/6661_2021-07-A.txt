Footnotes
BEST CAUSE stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn and drew clear in the stretch to prove much the best under a drive. PROMISE
OF JOY pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but proved to be no match for the winner while second best. DANCING TIZ WAY
was reluctant to load, then was off a step slow and trailed early, then saved ground and was up for the show award on the inside. PECULIARITY set a
pressured pace from the two path and faded losing the show spot late. TRULY A DREAM chased the pace three wide and weakened. SASSY BABE
tracked the early pace five wide and stopped.

TEXAS REWARD was allowed to settle early, then moved to the outside and made a six wide move on the turn, then drew out in the stretch to prove much
the best under a snug hand ride. OPULENT WAYS tracked the early pace and made a five bid on the turn with the winner but proved to be no match for that
rival while clearly second best. WILL TAKE ROSES was settled back early, came wide into the drive to finish well for the show award on the outside. DRIVE
IN dueled for the lead on the inside but off the rail and weakened. SIMPLE STORY dueled for the lead three wide and weakened. DANCE LIGHTLY was
bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide and weakened. LA LLUVIA chased the early pace four wide and in between rivals and tired.

Footnotes
JUST ENOUGH stalked the early pace in between horses, then swung out four wide to make a bid leaving the turn, was trying to lug in but was corrected
with left handed urging to draw clear in the final furlong. SCREEN STAR was allowed to settle while six wide, then came widest into the drive and rallied
well. QUAD EIGHTS was bumped at the start, then stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid to take over passed the quarter pole, but faded final
furlong. TAPPIN HONOR stalked the pace from the inside and weakened. TIZ GOLDEN set the early pace while three wide and was headed by the five
sixteenths pole and weakened. FLYING BANKROLL was settled while five wide and had no rally. Due to a timer malfunction internal fractions were
unavailable and the final was hand timed.
