Footnotes
SENSE YOU LEFT quickly established a clear advantage, drew off turning for home, and widened through the lane under mild hand urging. SWANAGE
stalked the clear leader from the two path, but failed to keep pace with that foe turning for home, then chased that foe through the lane to prove second
best. BEAUTIFUL BELLA settled far off of the pace, advanced in the three path around the far turn, and stayed on for a minor share. HELLCAT WARRIOR
saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. BOW DOWN TEWMEY stalked three wide, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. NANCY WORK tracked
from midpack, then four wide around the far turn, but tired through the final furlong. EMPRESS LUCIANA was outrun and eased through the lane.
