MEADOWBROOK ROAD perfect position to turn, split horses into the turn, ran on through the stretch to prevail at wire. TWIRLING RUTH quick from gate,
chased leader, led stretch, nailed on wire. GOOD FAITH inside trip to turn shuffled back, rallied back for show spot. RUTABAGA rushed to turn outside, ran
evenly through the stretch, no gain. HOMEROOM ANGEL inside run to turn, improved position in the late going. SLAINTE speed to the front had a rail run
to no avail and faded inside. SPY A STAR raced a wide trip with no late kick when called upon. UPCYCLE awkward start, never close to stretch, no
menace. DEFINITELY MAYBE never in contention. LEMONY SASS hustled along off rail to turn with no response. BELLEHAVEN outrun. LUNA TIGRESS
jostled around after start, dropped back no factor. PER OHIO STATE RACING COMMISSION RULING #2021-BP-034, DATED 08/21/2021
MEADOWBROOK ROAD WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
