INTERNET EXPRESS hustled from the break to assume first command and refused to relish that command from a two path stance for a gate to wire score.
CALEBS TIGER rushed from outset to force the pace issue, rated close up at the quarter pole along the inside, but was denied in final furlong by the gate to
wire winner. WOODS OF CONGAREE showed reserve along the backstretch, was roused through the bend and closed fast in the final furlong to secure the
show. PICTURE ME CLASSY settled in behind the pacesetting duo, gave chase from a ground saving stance, and lacked a rally in the homestretch.

Footnotes
VALENTINA LIL came away alertly and in tandem with FIDDLERSHOTPLEASUR to share the early command, trekked the two path alongside that rival
through the opening half, then strided away from all rivals in the final quarter for a clear score. CLEVER MELODY stalked the pacesetting duo from a wide
stance through the first two bends, rated close up at the conclusion of the backstretch, and finished a clear second but was no match for the winner in final
furlong. FIDDLERSHOTPLEASUR flashed early foot and shared command with the eventual winner through the first half, saved ground throughout, but
couldnt last in the closing stages. FANCY DIVA was unhurried in the opening portion of contest, tucked to save ground, trailed the field through the half, and
passed a tiring rival in late going. OH DANNY GIRL gave chase from an inside stance early, trekked the three path midway, and tired in the end.

GENTLE ROCKET tucked behind early pacesetters and gave chase from through the opening bend from an inside stance, closed the gap on leaders near
the three eighths pole, gained command along the inside and inched away in final furlong. TRUMP'SPRIDE rushed form outset and led the field through the
opening half, was headed just inside the quarter pole while rating between rivals, latched into a duel at upper stretch with WINDBLOWN TREE and
prevailed over that rival for place honors. WINDBLOWN TREE settled behind the early pacesetters nd sved ground around the first bend, advanced with a
mid move along the backstretch, rated three wide at the conclusion of backstretch, locked into a stretch duel with TRUMP'SPRIDE but was outdueled by
that foe and forced to settle for show. ZANE GRAY pressed the pace for the opening half while trekking the two path, then backed out at quarter pole and
failed to come again to improve placing. FLYING TIGER ACE lacked a rally after traveling wide early and giving chase from the two path at upper stretch.

wire score. I'M A STEPHANIE stalked the pacesetter around the first bend while travelling widest of all, was roused near the conclusion of backstretch, and

MISS CASEY BETH was hustled from outset to establish an inside position, gained command shortly after the start and refused to relish that command for a
gate to wire victory. LADY ABIGAIL rated just off the pace at conclusion of backstretch, was close up at the quarter pole while trekking the widest of three
abreast, then proved second best after being unable to run down leader in closing stages. FINAL DESIGN settled behind the front running trio along the
backstretch and lacked a closing rally to gain on the leaders in latter portion of contest. MIX AND MINGLE lost contact with rivals in the early going and
failed to menace. DEJA SUE flashed early interest and rated close up at conclusion of backstretch before retreating steadily in closing strides. BOBS
PAWNEE trailed from outset and was no threat.

SARAHS HOME hustled from outset to assume first command, angled in to save ground and refused to relish command in a gate to wire victory.
EUROTIGRE hurried from outset along the inside, rated close up at conclusion of backstretch, pressed the pacesetter around the bend but proved to be no
match for that rival in final furlong while finishing a clear second. HANS LITTLE DANCER settled in behind pacesetting duo, led the second flight along
backstretch and through the turn, then proved to be best of rest. GODDESS OF WONDER settled into second flight, rated three wide at upper stretch and
finished willingly. HEARTBREAK ROAD rated mid pack along the backstretch, saved ground through the turn and improved placing by doing so. ONE FAST
CASH broke a step slow, closed the gap nearing the quarter pole, and rallied mildly four wide at upper stretch to advance placing. TIAGO'S SONG was
unprepared at start and spotted the field a few strides early, trekked widest of all around the hook, and showed late interest. SQUEAKY BOOTS was unruly
in the gate, rated mid pack and travelled wide along the backstretch, then faded rapidly in closing stages. PIAMARIA saved ground, trailed the field and
gained experience.

YAK ATTACK was sent from outset to contest the early pace from a two path pose through the opening bend, rated just off heels of leader along the
backstretch, gained command nearing the quarter pole then shook clear of all rivals in the final quarter for the victory. ROYAL SOPRANO stalked the
pacesetting duo from an inside stance around the opening turn, angled out near the three sixteenths pole and finished a clear second but was no match for
the tough winner in the end. INCLUDING ELLIE settled into mid pack through the first half, trekked the two path at upper stretch and finished with good late
strides to win the stretch duel for show over. NEW YEARS LOVE , who flashed early foot and led the field around the first bend, was headed midway down
the backstretch and finished willingly along the inside. OREO GIRL saved ground to no avail. PRIMARY CAUSE failed to threaten from a back rated
position.

Footnotes
HUMOR'S REWARD was reserved and well off the pace for the opening half, saved ground through second bend, closed the gap on the leaders along the
backstretch, swung to three wide inside the quarter pole and finished the rally in the final furlong for the score. TOWN DRUNK hustled away from outset and
led the field around all turns, but was unable to fend off the rally of rival in the final eighth. JOHN ALLEN traveled wide in the early going, rated close up at
the midway point while trekking the two path, then was unable to match strides with top pair in final furlong. COOKIES ARE GOOD trailed the field from
outset into the homestretch and passed a tiring rival in closing stages. TUDORS CHARGE stalked the early pace from a two path pose, then retreated
rapidly in the latter half of contest.
