Footnotes
SMART TRIAL settled briefly, was roused midway on the backstretch, advanced along the rail on the bend, altered out just inside the eighth pole, was all
out and swept past INSIDE THE CIRCLE nearing the wire. INSIDE THE CIRCLE broke on top and was quickly clear of the others, let out some on the bend,
roused leaving the turn, under a drive through the stretch, did not have enough left in the waning yards but was clearly best of the rest. AWESOME SKIPPY
bumped from the rear at the break, was prominent from inside, gained second on the bend, swung out leaving the turn, drifted out further upper stretch, was
corrected but could only hold onto third late. KARAYEL forwardly placed between rivals, did not keep up into the turn, swung to the outside, was brushed
from the rear at the top of the lane, improved position as he gradually angled in and was closing in for the show deep stretch. JULE'S A RUNNER pressed
INSIDE THE CIRCLE from just outside, began to yield on the bend, angled out at the top of the stretch causing crowding to NUMERO PRIMO and
KARAYEL, was corrected and gradually angled back in as he continued to fade. NUMERO PRIMO broke a step slowly and inward, bumping AWESOME
SKIPPY, raced in contention from outside on the backstretch, did not stay close three wide on the turn, was crowded, forced into KARAYEL and checked at
the top of the lane and also steadily gave way.

Footnotes
LILLET was sent to the lead and the inside, under a drive through the stretch, gradually drifted out but maintained full control. MISS LEARJET pressed
LILLET from just outside, gradually angled out as the latter came out in the stretch, could not close the gap on the leader but proved easily second best.
ENCHILADA forwardly placed between rivals on the backstretch, faded two wide on the bend, angled out widest upper stretch and had little to offer.
MIKAYLA ATTACK raced in contention from outside on the backstretch, angled in on the turn and steadily gave way. MARYS LAST SONG reluctant to load,
bucked coming out of the gate when the race began and lost her rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into MARYS LAST SONG'S start but no action taken
after their review.

Footnotes
SEE GRACE FLY BY a step slow at the start, progressed between rivals, was three wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run, took the lead
with a sixteenth left and began to draw off in the waning yards. HOLD THE SPENDING prominent from inside, was steadied when her path narrowed near
the half mile marker, stayed along the rail, was steadied from upper stretch to nearing the sixteenth pole as her path was compromised by G CITY
WARRIOR, steadied again briefly at the seventy yard pole, got through from inside shortly after that, rallied and edged ahead for second. G CITY
WARRIOR showed first and set a pressured pace just off the inside and slowly wore down the last eighth. DUSTY MILLER also a step slow at the break,
was a contender form outside on the backstretch, retreated on the turn, moved to the inside entering the lane and had no late bid. RUBY ROUND HERE
pressed G CITY WARRIOR from just outside but flattened out for the drive.

Footnotes
TRY TRY AGAIN soon had a clear lead, showed the way in hand, was challenged on the second bend, roused with a quarter mile left, battled in tight
quarters along the rail in the lane and moved clear with a sixteenth to go. TETSU raced in the second flight from inside, went for the lead outside TRY TRY
AGAIN on the second turn, lugged in a bid to brush the latter a couple times inside the last furlong, slowly yielded the final sixteenth but proved easily
second best. JUSTENUFFTUFF raced in contention from outside, did not keep up two wide on the second bend, fanned out some for the stretch run and
caught DIAMOND DAVE for third late. DIAMOND DAVE chased from just off the inside, had the rail on the second turn, lodged a mild bid into the lane,
moved clear for third upper stretch but leveled off in the late going. LEMON BLITZ pressed TRY TRY AGAIN from just outside, did not keep up nearing the
second turn, moved out widest and gave way the last two furlongs. Due to a timer malfunction, the mile fraction is unavailable and the final time of the race
was hand timed.

Footnotes
HALO COUTURE was rated off the early pace, squeezed through along the rail midway on the bend to gain the lead then widened command under a
steady drive through the lane. PRETTY GITA broke outward, bumping and forcing out SOUTHERN ATTACK, set a pressured pace just off the rail but inside
HEART OF REASON, was challenged from both sides on the turn, did not stay with HALO COUTURE leaving the bend, moved clear for second upper
stretch then could only hold her position late. HEART OF REASON pressed PRETTY GITA from just outside, also went for the lead on the bend, did not
sustain her bid into the stretch but was unchallenged for third. MARLEE in midpack early from outside, improved position two wide on the turn, angled
outside HEART OF REASON upper stretch, lacked a rally but was clearly best of the others. MYSTERY STAR bumped at the start, saved ground on the
bend, came off the rail some for the stretch run and also had no late bid. HIDDEN FIGURE crowded briefly leaving the chute, chased in midpack from
between rivals then began to retreat from along the rail on the turn. THE MORE I BURN chased from outside on the backstretch, angled in to be two wide
on the bend, swung out to path five for the drive and had no rally. SOUTHERN ATTACK bumped then squeezed between horses at the break, showed little.
LADY OF LAHTI was always outrun in a wide trip.

Footnotes
JAMMING CAMERON showed the way in hand between rivals on the backstretch, had the rail on the bend, floated out some entering the stretch,
responded to urging and drew away from the rest. MEGAN'S HONOR pressed JAMMING CAMERON from outside, was no match for that one when set
down for the drive but kept TAP'S BIG SHOT at bay for the place. TAP'S BIG SHOT prominent from inside, found himself boxed in on the bend, had a clear
path along the rail into the stretch but lacked the needed late bid. DEANO moved to the outside midway on the backstretch, came into the lane four wide
and failed to have a significant response.

TURN YOUR EYES lugged in some shortly after the break, bumping SEBA'S DANCER, vied for the lead inside horses, moved clear when allowed into the
turn, was put to urging with two furlongs to go, widened command, began to wear down deep stretch but kept JUST RUN at bay under steady handling.
JUST RUN crowded shortly after the start, was settled, picked up his pace along the rail on the turn, came off the rail some for the stretch run, soon drew
clear for second, was closing the gap on the leader in the waning yards and proved easily second best. TRUE TEN chased from outside, did not keep up
two wide on the bend, fanned out some for the stretch turn, lodged his bid and drew away for third inside the final furlong. CITY POSITION forwardly placed
early, faded from contention while three wide on the turn, lost ground fanning outside the drifting G G'S SECONDCHANCE entering the lane and failed to
have a late bid. SEBA'S DANCER bumped and forced into JUST RUN shortly after the break, soon trailed, stayed off the inside taking the bend then passed
inside tired ones through the stretch. G G'S SECONDCHANCE was hustled up between rivals to contest the early pace, did not stay with TURN YOUR
EYES on the turn, drifted out into the lane then continued to gradually drift out as he faded between rivals. LEE'S LUCK raced in the second flight from
outside but began to yield before finishing three furlongs.
