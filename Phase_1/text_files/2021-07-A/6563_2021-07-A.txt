DAIRY KID dueled inside of rival on the backstretch, continued to duel on the turn, entered stretch with a slim advantage, responded to urging to draw clear
late. BALLET ROYALTY stalked pacesetters off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn and into the stretch in the two path, responded
to urging to rally up for second in the three horse photo for place. TRUTH PREVAILS tracked dueling leaders off the rail in the two path, continued off the
rail on the turn, launched stretch rally along the inside, and just missed second. LUCKY DAUGHTER bumped by outside rival at the start, sent to contest
lead two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, briefly had lead in upper stretch, battled for lead and faltered late in deep stretch. IN IT
FOR LIFE off a bit slow, bumped at the start when breaking in, settled off the pace two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, entered stretch in the
four path and needed more in the lane to improve position. BEST LADY saved ground throughout and failed to launch a rally when roused in the stretch.
