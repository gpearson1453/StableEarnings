starting gate prior to the start, was well placed and outside, looped four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and closed for the show.
LYNBROOKE stalked the pace on the outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, weakened and held a
share. J'S BAILEY ANN broke a step slowly from the gate and was no factor.

going and missed. BABY DRAGON allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch and edged up for the
show. KELLY BE KRUSIN allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch and got up for a share.
DOMINANT STRANGER well placed, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened in the drive.
CHARLITA mid pack, moved up inside through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. PRAIRIE CITIZEN

ELIA sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin while never being challenged and lasted under steady pressure. RED VENUS mid pack,
saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path between rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and closed the gap on the winner late.
MIDNIGHT BELLA allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and missed the place.
CLASSY HALO ran evenly, inside. BETTERTHENYOURX rated close up, faded the final furlong. TWILA MAE was never involved.
