Footnotes
RENEGADE SUNSET settled off of the pace, gained outside of foes into the far turn to produce a four wide bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, swept
past inner rivals entering the lane, drew clear in upper stretch, then tired in the late stages, but held. ST MARIA broke outwards and got rank early on,
settled at the rear of the field three wide, tucked to the two path into the backstretch, gained inside of RENEGADE SUNSET into the far turn, but steadied
behind rivals at the three furlong pole, awaited racing room turning for home, split foes while commencing a rally in upper stretch, steadily gained on the
outer leader through the late stages, but missed reaching that foe. LANGFUHR'S ANGEL tracked along the inside, produced a rail bid around the far turn,
but was outkicked by an outer rival turning for home, chased after losing place passing the furlong grounds, and held show thereafter. BLUE RIDGE HEAT
set the pace along the inside, bore out around the far turn which allowed for multiple foes to produce bids on both sides, came into KITTENOFTHE
COURT's path entering the lane, then kept on to vie for show, but failed to regain that position. KITTENOFTHE COURT stumbled at the start, recovered to
press the leader from the outside, bid into the far turn while being floated three wide, but was outkicked by an outer foe turning for home, then bumped by an
inner counterpart entering the lane, and faded. HONDURAS GIRL was outrun along the inside. The mile time has been omitted.

Footnotes
B'S LIL' BUMBLEBEE stalked along the inside, bid inside of the leader at the furlong grounds, and edged clear late. MARY JACK set the pace, built a clear
margin around the far turn, shifted to the three path entering the lane, but was headed by an inner foe at the furlong grounds, then drifted out through the
late stages while tiring, but saved place. BANKABLE broke through the gate pre-race, tracked two wide, but was outmoved by an inner foe around the far
turn, cut the corner turning for home to forge show in upper stretch, then shifted outside of the leading pair and chased them home. FLURRY OF
FEATHERS settled off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the two path before swinging six wide in upper stretch, but only produced a mild kick
and failed to threaten. SAND DRIFT settled far off of the pace in the two path, advanced mildly four wide into the far turn, then stayed on between horses
late. GOLDEN PAREE tracked three wide, chased the clear leader from the second flight around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch. CARSON'S
PRINCESS pressed the pace two wide, but faded between horses turning for home. VITA was outrun.

Footnotes
EMERALD FOREST cleared early on and shifted outwards, met JACK THE RIPPER (FR)'s rail bid into the turn, repelled that foe passing the five sixteenths
pole, drew off entering the lane, and widened under hand urging. JACK THE RIPPER (FR) pressed from along the inside of the leader, vied into the turn,
but proved no match for his outer counterpart at the five sixteenths pole, was confronted by another rival for place in midstretch, but held that position to the
wire. LIKEN IT tracked three wide, bid for place in midstretch, but hung for that position, and saved show. LIKE MIKE chased two wide and from between
horses early on, but backed out into the turn, swung four wide entering the lane, but failed to make an impact. ZELIG stalked along the inside, shifted two
wide turning for home, but failed to produce a bid. TEMPRANO was outrun in a dull effort.

Footnotes
IGNIS tracked from the two path into the turn, tipped outside of the leader at the five sixteenths pole, rallied to bid for the lead at the furlong grounds, dueled
outside of TAILORBESWIFT thereafter, and prevailed in the late stages. TAILORBESWIFT vied inside of HURRICANE TIZWAY early on, pressed that foe
around the turn before rebidding in upper stretch, dueled inside of a bidding IGNIS through the final furlong, but was bested. SHACKS RIVER saved ground
at the rear of the field, and improved through the lane. D'WILD BARONESS tracked from midpack two wide, but failed to factor. HURRICANE TIZWAY set
the pace outside of TAILORBESWIFT, clung to a narrow margin between horses in upper stretch, but gave way at the sixteenth pole. DR LIZ pressed three
wide, but weakened around the turn. UNTETHERED SOUL took the turn in the four path at the rear of the field, and was outrun.
