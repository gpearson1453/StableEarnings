Footnotes
INFINITE HEAT set the pacing up the backstretch with mild outside pressure, edged clear after the opening three-sixteenths, continued on or just off the rail
on the turn extending the advantage, held safe while being shaken up late. READS PET ZENON was allowed to settle racing outside, passed rivals four to
five wide on the turn and continued to gain steadily. TRUEZER raced mid-pack three to four wide on the turn and was never close enough to threaten. JET
SET WARRIOR broke inwardly just a bit, saved ground on the turn, failed to rally. EVIL TEMPTATION pressed then chased the eventual winner, went two
to three wide on the turn while dropping back, faded.

Footnotes
SAYWARD moved forward to take command after the opening three-sixteenths, was well clear passing the half-mile marker racing off the inside, went in the
two to three path on the turn, widened into upper stretch and was kept to the task late. AFFAIRS UNLIMITED bumped the inner foe and steadied after the
start, switched outside rivals heading up the backstretch in pursuit, went five wide on the turn, could not catch the winner but secured the place. INDIAN
DIVA chased the leader four wide into the turn, was asked by the quarter pole, had no extra in the drive but saved show honors. OLIVE COUNTY settled
toward the back, went in the three path on the turn, came out a bit for the drive and missed show honors. WHAT A SURPRISE settled toward the back
inside a rival, raced in the five to six path through most of the turn, altered outside a tiring foe near the three-sixteenths and lightly brushed a rival, ran on to
improve. TELLURIDE QUEEN switched outside the leader clearing the gap, chased two to three wide up the backstretch, went two deep on the turn, had no
extra. IROQUOIS HEART was bumped after the break, moved forward under encouragement along the inside to pursue the leader, weakened thereafter.
MINNIE ME HA raced outside runners toward the rear, went seven wide on the turn, was brushed lightly late on that bend, ran on evenly. RECOMPENSE
chased briefly, dropped back six wide on the turn, tired.
