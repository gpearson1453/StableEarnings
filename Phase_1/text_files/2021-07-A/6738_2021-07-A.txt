Footnotes
RENO ROY was away in good order to duel for the early advantage from between foes, opened a clear margin into the stretch and drew off with complete
authority. CHUCK NAZTY was off slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, could not gain on the winner in
the drive but finished well to gain the place. TIZ MANNY broke sharply to dispute the pace while racing three-wide, gave way to the winner after going a half,
stayed on in the drive and gave way late for the place. FOREFATHERS FURY pressed the pace from the inside, steadied nearing the seven-sixteenths
pole, moved five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. PERFECT D was off slow then forwardly placed from between foes, moved four-wide through
the turn and weakened.

JUDICIAL broke sharply to duel for the lead with LADY CAMBELL from the inside, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run and drew off through the
lane. KERRALIA was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. LADY
CAMPBELL was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way to that rival after going a half. M FAST
showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. FORTUNE'S FREUDE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn,
angled out further nearing the quarter and did not menace.

GOLD N GLITTER bobbled at the break, quickly recovered to open a clear margin before going a quarter, increased her advantage into the stretch and
drew off as the handiest of winners. MOSCOW LADY steadied soon after the start, raced five-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the
drive but clearly second best. LET IT REIGN was off slow, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, drifted in through the lane and failed to gain.
COASTAL QUEEN chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gradually weakened. LADY COMMISH lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. FLO TIME showed brief speed and weakened.

throughout and finished willingly in the drive. L D' RADO GOLDRUSH sprinted clear soon after the start, responded when challenged nearing the quarter
and gave way through the final furlong. MAJESTIC CAFE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive.

UNMACHABLE raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good late energy.

DEPUTY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached a contending position and finished evenly late. MUNCEY settled off the
leaders from the inside and lacked the needed closing response. COLLUSIONIST showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not
threaten. BAJA SUR was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn, fell in mid-stretch and was vanned off.

DAFFODIL SWEET tracked the pace of IMA HAPPY CAT from the inside, angled out nearing the five-sixteenths pole, reached the fore with a quarter to run,
opened a clear margin in mid-stretch and drew off. DONTKISSNTELL settled off the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and
finished with good late energy. SQUAN'S KINGDOM raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out with a furlong to run and finished with
a late rally. IMA HAPPY CAT sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, yielded to the winner through the final furlong and gave way
through the closing yards. KILLARNEY LASS was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. GETTIN
SIDEWAYS was off slow, lagged far back early, saved ground and was not a factor. MISS IMPORTANT lacked early speed, raced off the rail through the
turn, angled out into the stretch and did not threaten. COCO BEE raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the
quarter and weakened. EYES OPEN raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, weakened and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
CHRIS THE BEAVER stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole, responded when
challenged by SHARK HARBOR in mid-stretch, vied with that rival and proved best in a stiff drive. SHARK HARBOR was reserved just off the leaders early,
moved five-wide through the turn, gained a brief lead with a furlong to run, vied with the winner but could not match strides late. STARZAN was never far
back, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the lane and finished with a steady bid. AUTISM IMPACT settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. RAPHAEL lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and did not menace.
ANGEL OF THE CITY lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and failed to rally. BODEEMAN sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while
setting the pace and weakened after going a half.
