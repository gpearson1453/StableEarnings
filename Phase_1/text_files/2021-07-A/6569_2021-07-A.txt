STILLETO BOY seized command just after the outset, edged clear when given his cue around the far turn and maintained his advantage in the stretch
under solid handling. FLASH OF MISCHIEF stalked the pace, was outpaced on the far turn and responded gamely in the stretch to secure the place spot.
GAGETOWN outrun early, commenced his around the bid far turn and finished well in the stretch without posing a threat to the top pair. SUPER STOCK
saved ground, remained inside for the stretch run and lacked a substantive rally. NOVA RAGS chased while four wide and offered no response when called
upon on the far turn. RIGHTANDJUST raced forwardly between foes and faltered on the far turn.
