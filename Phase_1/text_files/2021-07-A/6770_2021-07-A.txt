Footnotes
SHE'S MY WARRIOR broke readily, was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, kicked clear entering the bend and held sway on a
comfortable margin to the end under right handed pressure. SPEEDY ENOUGH was settled into stride while angling to the rail in early stages, swung out to
the four path in upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to edge a rival for the place honors late. SHEZONEZESTREET, urged along three
wide pursuing the leader into the turn, couldn't close the gap on that rival and weakened in late stages. MINKOTA JOY, urged along the rail disputing the
pace in the opening furlong, gave way into upper stretch. SLEEPLESS NIGHTS came under pressure early pursuing the first flight between foes but faded
entering the turn. BIRD FEATHER was always outpaced. The half mile time was omitted.

COLLEGE PARTY broke readily, was urged to the lead inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow margin to the turn, edged away nearing upper stretch
and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. ROYAL PRIVACY tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, tipped out three wide
entering the lane and continued with interest to edge rivals for the place honors. MAN U, urged along three wide in pursuit of the pacesetter into the turn,
was fanned to the four path entering the lane and continued evenly late while gaining a share. ROCKTIZWAY, urged between foes prompting the pace
racing to the turn, faded nearing midstretch. FAIR CHALLENGE angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes racing to the turn but had no closing
bid. GAME LOADING trailed throughout.

DOCTOR OSCAR broke inwards, quickly sped to the lead along the rail racing into the turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to upper stretch, then
responded well to left handed pressure to maintain a clear advantage through the stretch to prevail. LOVE THE NEST, bumped from both sides, then
squeezed back at the start, was prompted to regain contention between foes racing into the bend, angled outside foes to advance in the four path in upper
stretch and continued willingly to the end while failing to gain even terms with the winner. NORTH ARM BAY tracked the pacesetter four wide to the turn,
then continued evenly outside foes while gaining a share in late stages. SILENT SAILOR, urged three wide pursuing the pacesetter into the turn to briefly
gain terms with that foe nearing upper stretch, gave way in the drive. MINNESOTA RED, caught in tight quarters at the start, was hustled up the rail on the
turn to gain a position just off the winner nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. BOOTLEGGIN POSSE broke out bumping LOVE THE NEST,
angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn and steadily faded into the lane. NU NU broke inwards bumping LOVE THE NEST and
dropped out early. MAGIC REVOLUTION was outrun.

FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM was urged inside foes disputing the pace racing to the far turn, turned back a rival's challenge racing into upper stretch and
edged away under firm encouragement. SIERRA HOTEL, urged to terms with the first flight three wide prompting the pace, shifted in nearing the lane to
press the issue outside the eventual winner striking the front but proved only second best. MY BOY LOLLIPOP tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of
the second flight racing to the far turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to edge rivals for a share while moving to
close the gap. TEDDY TIME tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, switched out nearing upper stretch, came around a tiring foe,
then angled to the inside in the closing stages while continuing with interest to improve position. IRISH MAJOR, urged between foes prompting the pace to
the far turn, gave way nearing the lane. FLIP THE COIN JAN angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, steadily faded into upper
stretch. BANKROLL BEN brushed the gate while being shut off at the start, was reserved near the inside as part of the last flight and failed to menace
thereafter. FLASHYMEISTER broke inwards crossing the path of BANKROLL BEN, was settled outside a rival to the backstretch and soon dropped out.

J P WARRIOR took up a position between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, steadied momentarily in tight quarters on the far turn, continued
with a steady advance through the stretch to gain terms with the pacesetter and prevailed in time under firm encouragement. SAMYAZA sped to the lead
along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, was urged clear racing into upper stretch, held sway past the furlong marker but couldn't
contain the winner's late bid. DOODLE TIME settled off the second flight racing outside a rival to the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper
stretch, split foes entering the lane, then altered course three wide in the closing stages and continued with interest to close the gap. GO SPEED RACER
GO tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight, was held up momentarily racing in close quarters through the far turn, saved ground to
upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. BAYOU PROSPECTOR, off slowly, was righted to gain a position three deep in second flight racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to lodge a brief bid in that path on the far turn but came up empty in the drive. GAINER settled last while angling to the inside but
never gained contention. PUBLIC SAFETY broke sharply, attended the pace outside a rival racing to the far turn, then gave way between foes into the lane.
FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF GO SPEED RACER GO LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ON THE FAR TURN BUT
THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

MYSTIFIER angled to the inside tracking off the first flight under light rating racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while shifting out nearing
upper stretch, moved to challenge four deep midstretch and wrested the advantage under firm handling. DARK SOLUTION sped to the lead along the
inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, shifted off the rail resisting the winner's bid leaving midstretch but couldn't contain that rival while
narrowly prevailing for the place honors. FEEDING FRENZY, in touch with the pacesetter between foes racing to the first turn, eased off the pace to track
the leaders along the inside racing to the far turn, advanced along the rail late to bid inside the top pair but was outkicked. LORING PARK, urged to terms
with the first flight three wide between foes racing to the backstretch, prompted the pace outside a rival to the far turn and weakened in the drive. MACHO
RAPIDO tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and continued evenly. SR. BOM BON hit the gate while breaking
awkwardly, was collected to track off the second flight three wide to the backstretch, continued in that path into the stretch but had no closing bid.
ITWASTHEDEVILSIDEA settled along the inside in the last flight to the backstretch, was held up momentarily when caught in close quarters entering the far
turn, saved ground to the stretch but made no impression. OUT RUN'M tracked off the second flight between foes to the far turn and steadily faded nearing
the lane. PIRATE BIRD hopped at the start, settled outside a rival in the last flight early and never gained contention. HISMUDDAWASAMUDDA, caught
four wide racing into the first turn, tracked the pace outside a rival in second flight but gave way after a half.
