TRULY FABULOUS broke on top and set the pace through the turn while three wide, was mildly pressured on the turn by the runner-up but kept that one at
bay through the stretch and won in a drive. CIRCULODEGANADORAS sat just off of TRULY FABULOUS through the turn while four wide, put mild pressure
on that one on the turn but could not close the margin through the stretch while besting the rest. MISS SKI chased the top pair through the turn while three
wide and lacked a late rally in the stretch. FRIEND OF AUTISM was shuffled back soon after the start, was rushed up along the turn while four wide and
lacked the needed response in the stretch.

OSCAR NOD broke on top, was hustled to set the fractions through the turn, opened up the lead off of the turn and drew off in the end. AFTER SUNDOWN
prompted the pace of OSCAR NOD through the turn while three wide, lost ground off of the turn and was outkicked by the winner, while saving second. ALL
MY HOPE chased the pace, was in tight traffic on the turn while two wide between horses and was outfinished in the stretch run but did pressure the
runner-up for the place. PERFECT EDITION had no speed in the early stages, was four then five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response in the
stretch drive. ALMA SPIRIT tracked the leaders through the turn while four wide and weakened in the stretch run. SUPER BUNNY sat just off of the early
pace, saved ground on the turn and faded in the late stages.

SPACE ODESSEY set the pace through the second turn, was pressured on the second turn by J T'S CREDITCARD, turned that one away and kicked clear
in the stretch to prevail. BOYSON settled at the rear of the field, was four then five wide on the second turn, gained ground off of the turn but ran evenly in
the stretch while second best. J T'S CREDITCARD prompted the pace through the second turn, challenged the winner on the second turn but was turned
away, ducked in inside of the final sixteenth and tired late while holding for third. GEE GEE WHIZ stalked the pace through the second turn while four wide
and did not offer a bid in the stretch run. BIG IRISH EYES settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground on the second turn and weakened in the stretch
run.

Footnotes
HULA KING sat just off of the early pace, was five wide on the turn, made a quick move off of the turn to take the lead and kicked clear in the end. RED'S
SHOWTIME set contested fractions through the turn while two wide, opened up the lead off of the turn but was quickly passed by the winner and tired in the
late stages but saved second. CHANGING IMAGE settled toward the rear of the field, was four then five wide on the turn and gained ground in the stretch,
finishing willingly late and just missing for second. STARK MARK pressed the pace through the turn while four wide and weakened in the stretch drive.
RUNAWAY KRISTIN had no speed early, was three wide on the turn and did not mount a late rally in the stretch. GREGS CITY ZIP chased the pace from
toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the turn and was empty for the stretch drive.

ITALIANO sat just off of the early pace, was two wide on the turn while gaining ground, confronted GALOPING CAT inside of the furlong marker and pushed
past that foe to win in a drive. CLEM LABINE chased the early pace, lost ground on the turn while five wide and rallied in the stretch to get the nod for
second, but was not pressuring the winner. GALOPING CAT chased the pace into the turn, took the lead while two wide on the turn, was confronted nearing
the eighth pole and was outfinished in the stretch while just missing for the place. WAR GAMES took up nearing the five-sixteenths pole when the loose
horse came over a path, contested the pace through the turn while three wide but tired in the stretch. APPRECIATED settled in the midpack through the
turn, saved ground on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. SUNRISE JOURNEY pressed the pace through the turn while four wide and weakened
in the stretch drive. PRINCE DE PRINCE checked nearing the five-sixteenths marker when the loose horse came over a path, chased the pace from the
midflight while four wide and gave out in the stretch run. TERRY'S BOY stumbled at the start and lost the rider. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE AND MADE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER.

UNPOSSIBLE broke alertly and set all of the pace through the second turn, was pressured on the second turn by RIDEO and turned that foe away, was
pressured in the final sixteenth by SUNNY SPOT and dug in to hold on for the win. SUNNY SPOT stalked the pace through the second turn, was three wide
on the second turn, mounted a late bid in the stretch to pressure the winner, could not reel him in but was an easy second over the rest. RIDEO stumbled at
the start, sat just off of the early pace, pressured the winner along the second turn but was turned away and tired in the stretch run while holding for third.
AMERICAN ROYALTY was floated five wide on the first turn, settled at the rear of the field, was three wide on the second turn and did not rally in the stretch
run. GLENROY stalked the pace, lost ground on the second turn while four wide and gave out in the stretch run.

Footnotes
DIRT FLIRT broke alertly and tracked the early pace, was six wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn to confront CLEVER CHIEFTESS, took the lead
and drew clear in the end. CLEVER CHIEFTESS set the pace through the turn, extended the lead a bit on the turn while three wide but was confronted off
of the turn and was outfinished by the winner, while holding on for second. SHOUT IT OUT settled in the midflight, gained ground on the turn while six wide
but finished evenly in the stretch as an easy third. SUNSET STAR chased the early pace, saved ground on the turn, gained ground into the lane but tired in
the final stages. ELA CALIMERA MOU was off a bit slowly and trailed the field through the turn, was four wide on the turn, the rider dropped the whip inside
of the three-eighths, and did not rally. YAH YEENG chased the early pace, was five wide on the turn while still close up but lost ground off of the turn and
tired in the stretch run. NICOLE KNOWS settled toward the rear of the field, was six wide then swung out seven wide for the drive and weakened in the
stretch run. FLASHIN PASSION stumbled at the start, then was hustled to chase the early pace, saved ground while two wide on the turn but faded in the
stretch drive. PROJECT LOGIC pressed the early pace, was four wide on the turn while still close up but was outrun off of the turn and gave out in the
stretch drive.
