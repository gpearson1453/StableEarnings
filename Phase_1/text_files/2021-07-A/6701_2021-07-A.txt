Footnotes
CASH COMES FIRST stalked the pace, circled the turn four wide, swept to command inside the eighth pole and drew off while kept to his business.
ERAWAN lacked speed, hugged the inner rail from the quarter pole to the eighth pole, altered course to the four path in mid stretch and closed nicely.
DEGAS showed speed in the two path, briefly opened a clear lead approaching the eighth pole and weakened in the drive. KICKSTARTER brushed with
MAINE leaving the starting gate, chased the pace, was three wide leaving the turn, angled in for the drive, moved up to the sixteenth pole then weakened.
MR. WALSH lacked speed, was never a threat and turned for home in the two path. LADNEEDSAHANDLER , three deep prompting the pace around the
turn, gave way the final furlong. MAINE , brushed at the start, showed speed along the inner rail and faltered.

Footnotes
GOLDEN CAN stalked off the rail, closed in under right handed rousing and engaged the leader past the three sixteenths, gained a short lead inside the
furlong grounds and dug in tenaciously to prevail. INSIGHTFUL had speed to the inside of rivals, rated back after about a furlong, eased out and came back
to challenge between runners leaving the eighth pole, dueled inside the winner from there and held well. WOODBINE WAY chased three wide outside the
winner, shifted out a bit wider for the drive and kept on willingly between foes. A GIRL NAMED JAC , off the pace while saving ground early, came three
wide for the drive, altered out for the final furlong and closed steadily. CINDY'S PRAYER sped clear early then dropped in to set the pace, was joined past
the three sixteenths, stayed on to about the sixteenth pole then weakened. LUCRE broke slowly, saved ground under asking, angled out, had a belated gain
but failed to threaten. GUNS BLAZING , four wide pursuing the pace, came up empty. ALWAYS SOMETHING , between runners nearing the turn, gave
way.

HICKTOWN , a forward factor down the backstretch, circled foes three deep around the turn, advanced to challenge for the lead in mid stretch and narrowly
prevailed in an extended drive. DETERMINED TRUTH prompted the pace two wide down the backstretch, gained the lead leaving the turn, was challenged
in mid stretch and dug in stubbornly to just miss. SENSON , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, failed to menace and passed a tired rival.
HANNAHS RED RUBY showed speed along the inner rail and weakened through the stretch.

Footnotes
FAST LANI eased outside the leader and tracked in hand early on, went on the attack into the turn, opened up without much asking around the turn, moved
out to a long lead in mid stretch, kept on under a drive and held sway. GREEN EYES settled off the pace four wide, circled four wide advancing into the
lane, closed willingly and out finished KEEPYOURSKATESON for the place. KEEPYOURSKATESON , off the pace two wide, raced between rivals mid
turn, angled five wide for the drive and closed steadily. AMERICAS WOMAN , off the pace, raced two wide into the lane, altered out through the drive and
rallied. GREAT CAUSE , between rivals leaving the far turn, failed to menace. MS. HAITI broke slowly, circled five wide into the lane and had belated action.
MATUNUCK chased three wide and faded. SEVILLA SANGRIA saved ground leaving the far turn, eased out then lacked some room between foes in mid
stretch. MERRY MAID saved ground pursuing the pace, raced in range to upper stretch then gave way. ADABEL saved ground off the pace then was
blocked near the furlong grounds. COMPETENT sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, ceded command leaving the far turn, chased to upper
stretch then retreated.

Footnotes
FLAT RATE disputed the pace outside GLENGAR, disposed of that one in upper stretch, was challenged by PASCAL CHANT in mid stretch and
determinedly turned back that rival. PASCAL CHANT , three wide stalking the pace around the turn, challenged for the lead outside the winner in mid stretch
and weakened late. EXTRA MEDIUM lacked speed, circled the turn four wide, failed to menace and was bumped by TICKER TAPE PARADE in upper
stretch. GLENGAR , fractious behind the starting gate, showed speed along the rail, dueled to upper stretch, gave way and was eased late. SMART STEP ,
no factor, raced along the inner rail around the turn. TICKER TAPE PARADE lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, bumped EXTRA MEDIUM when
drifting out in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. NOVA BOY , outrun, drifted five wide leaving the turn.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF CAPS , under snug rating between foes while tracking the pace, got through along the inside as the leader drifted into the lane, spurted clear
under a drive in mid stretch, dug in when confronted inside the sixteenth pole, dueled and proved best. TIPYOURHATTOTHAT settled three wide outside
rivals and in range, took closer order past the five sixteenths, angled five wide into the lane, responded and ranged up leaving mid stretch, battled outside
the winner through the final seventy yards but wasn't quite good enough. STROLLED ON BY broke a step slow, settled well back, made progress and split
rivals leaving the three eighths, had aim three wide into the lane, shifted in and churned on. TYLER TIME cleared early, set the pace towards the inside,
dueled past the five sixteenths, wandered outward a bit into the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then gave way. TRANSIT stalked inside, steadied lightly
off the winner nearing the lane then came up empty. MENTALIST , inside off the pace, was under a ride chasing past the five sixteenths, eased out and
failed to rally. CRITICIZE saved ground off the early pace, angled out and advanced between runners mid way on the final turn, chased into the lane but
lacked a further punch. BRIDGE OF HOPE , fractious in the gate, was outrun. MALIBU HEAVEN prompted the pace outside the leader, bid to apply more
pressure leaving the far turn, dueled, was floated out entering the stretch and gave way. LUV THE PAINTER saved ground early, angled out for the
backstretch run but failed to make an impact. CRANSTON'S NETWORK lost ground four wide, stalked to the far turn then faltered.

AIR TOKEN lacked speed, hugged the inner rail, found room around the turn, had an ample opening along the rail through the stretch and led late. ZIGGY
MON showed speed, saved ground around the turn, drifted out near the eighth pole and drifted out late. YOUNGEST OF FIVE lacked speed, angled to the
four path in upper stretch, was in hand when caught in close quarters near the eighth pole and closed late outside the top pair. NOBLE COMMANDER ,
angled off the inner rail entering the turn, swung to the five path turning for home and failed to rally. BUSTOFF , four deep, mid way on the turn, was not a
factor. STROLL SMOKIN , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, tired. VALUED NOTION prompted the pace outside ZIGGY MON around the turn
and tired.

Footnotes
CONTRAFLOW , quickly clear, dropped in towards the rail and set a rated pace, responded when shaken up soon into the lane, widened in mid stretch,
wandered outward under steady hand encouragement and proved clearly best. SHANGHAIED ASTORIA lacked speed, was under a drive leaving the far
turn, angled out five wide, closed steadily and nabbed the place in the final yards. INK stalked the winner from the outside, was put to a strong ride pursuing
past the five sixteenths and stayed on willingly. FOLE'S NOTION , between rivals early, stalked to the far turn, failed to quicken under pressure and faded.
MARKET CAP , three deep the first turn, stalked the pace past the five eighths, moved up under a ride leaving the far turn, gave hard pursuit and gave way
in the final furlong. SEBASTIAN , inside rivals in range past the five eighths, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and dropped back.
