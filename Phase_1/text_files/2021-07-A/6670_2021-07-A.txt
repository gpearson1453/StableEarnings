path and got up in time under left handed urging. SAN RULER trailed for nearly six furlongs, closed willingly outside in the seven path and just missed.
LAUDERDALE pressed the pace two wide, took the lead on the far turn, widened into the stretch then was outfinished in the final yards. SLICK AS ICE
failed to menace. DEBDURITE moved up four wide on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. TEMPLE MOUNT was hustled to the lead soon after the
start, set the pace along the inside into the far turn then was used up.

Footnotes
VASARIANO never far back, closed with a burst of speed in the five then four paths through the stretch under left handed urging and got up in the final
strides. BOSS BEAR press the pace along the rail through the clubhouse turn, made the lead before a half, shook clear through upper stretch and just
missed hanging on. ROGALLO slow early, closed with fast three wide through the stretch to be clear for third. PERFECT SENSE passed tiring rivals in the
five path through the stretch. MURTAGH stalked the pace three wide and failed to offer the needed response. REINSURE failed to menace. DAWN WEST
was no threat. GOODIE GOOMER away alertly, set the early pace two wide, kept pressure into the stretch then gave way. MAKING ME CRAZY well placed
inside, failed to respond. COMPLY was no factor. GOOSE DOWN GREY was through after a half. SHARKS COVE wide, was through early.

Footnotes
MALPAIS stalked the near the inside, angled off the rail in upper stretch, surged to engage the leader in the five path and proved best by a narrow margin
under right handed urging. HOVER pressed the pace along the rail, took charge on the turn, shook clear in upper stretch, drifted to the four path, dug in
gamely when headed by the winner and just failed. ATTUCK had a brief lead the opening quarter, prompted the pace into the stretch then was outfinished.
MORE THAN GOOD found his best stride late in the four path. HOMERS MAGIC failed to menace. RULING EMPIRE was no factor. ICONIC was outrun.
BIG TRIP s=had speed four wide into the stretch and gave way late.
