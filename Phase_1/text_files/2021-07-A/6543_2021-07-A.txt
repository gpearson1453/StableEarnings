Footnotes
LUCAGO set the pace in the two path, repulsed a bid from ADVENTURE SEEKER turning for home, drew clear in upper stretch, drifted out steadily and
held sway. FISHING FOR FUN tracked the pace inside, swung four wide nearing the quarter pole, lugged in approaching the eighth pole, angled back out
soon after and was gaining in the later yards. ADVENTURE SEEKER broke awkwardly, advanced four wide around the turn, reached near even terms
outside of the winner at the quarter pole, could not match strides in upper stretch, angled to the rail when FISHING FOR FUN lugged in near the eight pole
and weakened. BOURBON OVER ICE failed to menace while racing three wide. WHISKEYONHISLIPS showed early speed two wide then steadily faded.
AGENT COOPER brushed the starting gate, raced two and three wide and never threatened. MAGICAL WARRIOR had brief speed three wide. POETIC
CODE was outrun inside.

Footnotes
ROBINTAKINCHARGE was bumped and forced in by JOY CITY at the start, recovered and pressed MAYOR REMO from outside, took over after six
furlongs, and widened steadily through the stretch under a stiff drive. MISTA DONZELLA was forced in by ROBINTAKINCHARGE and steadied at the start,
advanced after six furlongs shifting out four wide, and rallied mildly to be along for the place. MAYOR REMO set the pace near the inside, was powerless to
withstand the winner a quarter-mile out, and was overhauled late for second. RESIDENT saved ground early, moved out three wide approaching the stretch,
and posed no threat. UNCLE ARMANDO was outrun inside, and bumped with JOE BENJAMIN in deep stretch. JOE BENJAMIN lunged at the break, raced
well back two to three wide, and bumped with UNCLE ARMANDO in deep stretch. JOY CITY broke in bumping and forcing ROBINTAKINCHARGE inward,
showed speed for a half-mile outside, and tired.

left-handed urging near the sixteenth pole and yielded soon after. YES I'M SPITEFUL raced off the pace three wide and was along for the show. BABY

Footnotes
HY DOLLFACE broke alertly, set a pressured pace inside rivals for three furlongs, edged away turning for home and widened under pressure. RUBY LEE
vied between horses three then two wide to the head of the stretch, could not keep pace with the winner from there but stayed on for the place. BEAUTY
QUEEN bumped with FOLLOW ME MOM at the start, swung five wide with a mild rally coming off the turn, and finished one-paced outside. BEATING THE
ODDS stayed in range early, got a bit closer four wide near the quarter-pole, but flattened out into the stretch. FOLLOW ME MOM was bumped lightly
between horses at the start, and failed to threaten. YELLEN pressed the pace four then three wide to the top of the stretch, and faded. PRINCESS
CARRIGAN bumped lightly with FOLLOW ME MOM at the break, steadied lacking room between the latter and YELLEN right after that, and never
recovered. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA argued the early pace between horses, and dropped out of it before completing three furlongs.

was clearly second best. ROMANTIC TALE was in range three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, angled in and weakened. LOOKING FOR LOVE
failed to menace while racing two wide. HOUSE WRECKER was outrun inside.

PRINCESS BETTY let the other two fight it out up the backstretch, advanced entering the turn keeping TWIRLING STAR in her sights, headed that rival
from outside at the quarter-pole, and was kept busy widening through the lane. TWIRLING STAR came away alertly despite breaking outward, vied early
outside PRINCESS BETTY, went clear approaching the half-mile marker, got collared by PRINCESS BETTY after six furlongs, proved no match and ran on
second best. WAITING FOR A STAR vied early inside TWIRLING STAR, could not match strides after a half and dropped back steadily.

COMPETITIVE STAR sped to the front after an alert getaway, moved near the inside clearing off after a sixteenth of a mile or so, and maintained a
comfortable advantage through the stretch under pressure. MY BEAUTY PRINCESS pursued the winner from outside throughout, and stayed on for the
place. DRIVING WIND steadied back at the start and was outrun early, swung four wide approaching the stretch, and rallied mildly outside. JULIE BIRD
(IRE) saved ground to the stretch, and lacked the needed closing response. SENORITA SALSA raced three to four wide, and faded past the quarter-pole.
LUCKYTOHAVEMYVICKI became fractious in the gate prior to the start unseating the rider and briefly sitting down in the stall, had the rider remount
quickly, came away without further incident and was outrun three wide. FABIOLA PRINCESS faded steadily two wide. FLAT OUT COOL was pulled up
entering the turn, and walked off.
