Footnotes
NO FOOLING DUDE broke sharply, was taken to rate and stalked the leader three wide, came under pressure past the three eighths, closed in under
strong handling and engaged SELF AWARENESS mid stretch, dueled between foes, gained a slim lead late and held firm. SELF AWARENESS , bumped
soon after the break, accelerated clear early on, set a rated pace two wide, was put to a ride in upper stretch, dug in when confronted by a pair of rivals in
mid stretch, dueled and stayed on gamely to get the place. DOOBIEDOOBIEDOOBIE settled off the rail, picked up momentum past the five sixteenths and
circled four wide, ranged up to join the top pair in mid stretch, battled on near even terms a sixteenth out then hung late. COMMANDING GENERAL bobbled
at the break then was bumped, regrouped to rate inside, steadied off foes nearing the turn, swung five wide approaching the stretch but lacked a solid finish.
MORE TWIRL saved ground tracking the pace, came under pressure mid turn and faded. DRAGON MOON broke inward and bumped COMMANDING
GENERAL, raced between foes leaving the far turn, angled out and faded.

Footnotes
COSMICALITY set the pace along the rail, briefly lost the lead near the eighth pole, battled back, edged clear and switched to his left lead late. BALLYHOO
PRINCE stalked the pace near the inner rail, swung outside in mid stretch and rallied on her left lead. ANTIPOISON chased the winner, gained a brief two
wide lead in mid stretch, switched to his left lead and weakened. RIP IT , steadied in close quarters entering the backstretch, was in hand caught in traffic
leaving the far turn, worked between horses and finished willingly. IRON PEARLS lacked speed, was checked in tight quarters leaving the backstretch,
swung to the four path at the head of the stretch and passed tired foes. PAUPING , steadied in close quarters leaving the backstretch, angled to the five
path turning for home and failed to menace. HEROIC DEED failed to menace. HONEY ISLAND retreated through the stretch. CONTENTED NOW , four
wide both turns, was not a factor. CLEVER BOB was outrun. CUP MATCH , rank leaving the starting gate, raced near the inner rail and faltered.

SUBLIMITY vied outside a rival in hand, moved clear under rating past the three eighths, kept on under a drive past the furlong grounds, switched over to
her correct lead near the sixteenth pole and held firm. SACRED LADY , towards the inside early on, angled out around the turn, circled four wide into the
stretch, closed steadily through the final furlong and got up for the place. EIGHT OAKS circled four wide advancing nearing the quarter pole, lugged in with
aim past the eighth pole then got edged for second while under hand enouragement. CONGRESS HALL , four to five wide into the lane, flattened out.
SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM chased two wide, raced between rivals mid turn and gave way. DON'TBAGGAGECHECK vied inside, failed to keep pace past the
three eighths, chased and gave way. GLORY MARCH was outrun.

Footnotes
I LOVE YOU saved ground around both turns stalking the pace, was taken to the three path near the eighth pole, swept to command near the sixteenth pole
and drew off. BETCHA BY GOLLY disputed the pace outside EPIC IDEA and weakened the final furlong. SPEED LANE brushed with BUCKEYS CHARM
leaving the starting gate, circled both turns three wide under rating, had aim on the lead turning for home, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened. EPIC
IDEA hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to the sixteenth pole and weakened. PROPER STORM , no factor, raced three wide on the far turn.
BRUSHING , three wide entering the first turn, was not a factor. BUCKEY'S CHARM brushed with SPEED LANE at the break, raced near the inner rail and
was outrun.

BEHIND THE COUCH , patiently handled outside a rival and just off of a three pronged pace battle, eased out nearing the lane, shifted further out and
responded when set down past the three sixteenths, forged to command leaving the eighth pole and eagerly widened while ridden out. DEVILISH AFFAIR
was steadied when in close soon after the break, settled off the pace while saving ground, moved off the rail past the five sixteenths, steadied briefly then
shifted out five wide past the three sixteenths, straightened and finished up willingly to nab the place. HUFFLEPUFF set a pressured pace inside, dueled
inside rivals from the far turn to upper stretch, kept up the battle past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. FANCY PRINCESS , away well, dueled
between foes, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened late. TAM CHAR broke a step slow, edged up inside to gain a forward spot, had aim past the three
sixteenths then gave way. LAMBEAU LADY stumbled at the break, recovered and edged up three deep, disputed the pace from the far turn to upper
stretch, drifted out near mid stretch and weakened. BREWSTER FLATS , four wide outside rivals, raced in range to mid turn then weakened.

Footnotes
ALWAYSINAHURRY edged up inside nearing the half mile marker and tracked a contested pace, was under coaxing to hold a forward position past the
three eighths, angled out with run entering the lane, bid to take over in mid stretch then eagerly kicked away under a solid drive. MIGHTY MISCHIEF
accelerated inside rivals to dispute the pace, shook clear in two path into the lane, failed to resist the winner's charge with a furlong remaining, faded but
was clearly best of the rest. THREE TWO ZONE was sent up three wide between foes early on and contested the pace, dropped back a bit leaving the far
turn, made a mild comeback run four wide into lane, chased and came up empty in the final furlong. SINGLINO chased the leaders into the turn, angled out,
circled five to six wide into the stretch but failed to generate a significant response. RODERICK broke slowly, was used four wide outside rivals to join the
pace fray, held a slim lead into the turn, prompted the issue outside MIGHTY MISCHIEF around the turn, failed to kick on while three to four wide into the
lane and faltered. SIBELIUS bobbled at the break, sparred two wide between runners early on, stumbled leaving the far turn, was eased past the five
sixteenths and walked off.

Footnotes
MRS. ORB stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up in the two path on the far turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, closed outside
TROLLEY RIDE and took the lead approaching the finish. TROLLEY RIDE lacked speed, was lightly steadied on a rival's heels approaching the first turn,
swung outside mid way on the backstretch, was asked for run three deep approaching the far turn, circled horses three deep, took the lead in upper stretch,
finished gamely but missed. SWEET SAMI D saved ground stalking the pace, swung wide in upper stretch and offered a mild gain. ARTFUL SPLATTER ,
right to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and weakened through the stretch. HIS GLORY , two wide chasing the pace around the far turn, gave way
in upper stretch. SUGGESTIVE HONOR (ARG) was not a factor. GRACETOWN , along the inner rail most of the race, fell back.

YAUPON , nudged along two wide stalking the pace, shifted out three wide approaching the quarter pole, responded when put to a stout drive in upper
stretch, bid to secure command a furlong out then pulled away while kept to task. LAKI saved ground chasing the pace, eased out mid turn and took aim
into the lane, could not kick on with YAUPON to his outside but continued on with good energy to gain the place. CHATEAU was urged clear early then
taken to rate, set the pace towards the rail, came under a serious ride soon into the lane, had his rider drop the stick past the three sixteenths, failed to resist
soon after and faded in the final seventy yards. WHISKEY AND YOU bobbled inward at the break and failed to threaten.

CRACK THE SAFE hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and lasted under urging. GLEAMING SWORD stumbled at
the break, circled the turn four deep, drifted out turning for home and rallied. SMITTEN ENOUGH bumped with LOST UNCLE entering the turn, worked
between horses in upper stretch, angled out inside the eighth pole and closed late. DIVINE PROPORTION saved ground on the turn, raced in the two path
between horses in the stretch and had a mild gain. LEAVE 'EM LOADED bumped with RAVEN RAHY leaving the starting gate, was four deep on the turn
and failed to rally. VIRGINIA FIB lacked speed, saved ground on the turn and showed a mild, late move. ARTISTA , swung wide in upper stretch, passed
tired horses. LOST UNCLE bumped with SMITTEN ENOUGH and RAVEN RAHY entering the turn and failed to be a factor. HAIR OF THE DOG , three
wide chasing the pace around the turn, angled in to race along the inner rail through the stretch and gave way. ONE MORE FACTOR disputed the pace
outside the winner and gave way. RAVEN RAHY , bumped leaving the starting gate, raced very wide on the turn, bumped with LOST UNCLE near the three
eights pole and gave way.
