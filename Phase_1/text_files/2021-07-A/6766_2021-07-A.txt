HASTY LADY battled for the early lead two wide, shook clear on the turn then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best while in hand.
PULPIT'S PURRFECT contested the lead along the inside into the turn, shifted out to the four path and held on for second. J P'S GLADYS trailed into the
turn, swung wide and had a mild late rally in the middle of the racetrack. WILLOUGHBY GAP stalked the pace and went evenly. COULD YOU failed to
menace. ON THE CLOCK was fractious in the gate prior to the start, settled well back, stopped on the turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off.

CUE THE BAND had speed from the start, advanced four then two wide into the turn making the lead then widened the balance of the trip and won easily.
BAINBRIDGE never far back, rallied through the stretch in the six path and finished clear for second. WAFFLESORPANCAKES pressed the pace two wide
then along the inside into the stretch and faded late. WHERETHERE'SSMOKE had speed along the inside into the stretch then weakened. FRIENDLY
MERGER set a pressured pace into the turn and tired late. ALL THE BEST trailed. ENDURING LOVE was hustled along, suffered a catastrophic injury
midway on the turn, unseating her rider and was euthanized. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

QUEENOFCATNIPHILL made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, shook clear repeatedly, dug in gamely through deep stretch when challenged
by the runner up and proved best under right handed urging. FRESHMAN CLASS trailed early, closed willingly outside the winner in the five path and just
missed FRIDAY was bumped at the start, moved closer two wide on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. TURING MACHINE failed to menace. TIKA
broke outward bumping FRIDAY at the start, prompted the pace two wide through the far turn then faltered.

Footnotes
ANDREW THE GIANT never far back, rallied willingly in the four path through the stretch, made the lead late and drew off under brisk handling. SUPER
VISION away alertly, set a pressured pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. CONDUCIVE pressed the pace along the rail and finished
with good courage. SMOOTH TALKIN TOM stalked the pace three wide and lacked the needed response. SMASH went evenly. B DUBYA was no factor.
SAY HEY KID was no threat.

NICK CAN FIX never far back, closed with a burst of speed in the five path through upper stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker and won as
much the best. CLASSIC MO saved ground, had a mild late rally through the stretch and finished second best. GALACTIC pressed the pace two wide,
made the lead on the turn, set the pace into the stretch then was outfinished. PRIVATE DRIVE found his best stride late. RIDING IN THE WIND had a mild
late rally. POWERS OUT with the second flight two wide, angled out to the seven path entering the stretch and lost ground. SWEETNESSNCHARM with the
second flight inside, gave way late. SPEEDY MOBILE was no factor. INTO THE OUT away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the turn, kept pressure
into the stretch then folded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ST PATTY'S SONG never far back, surged with a burst of speed in the four path into the stretch, inherited the lead then finished full of run under a hand ride
to win as much the best. HEIDI'S SHADOW slow early, closed fast along the inside and got up for second. ZVOLUME unhurried early, finished with good
courage in the three path. WELLOILEDCAT slow early, found her best stride late. LOLA LOUISE was no factor. SMALLTOWN CAT well placed, had no
rally. MYSTIC MAGIC trailed, swung wide and passed tiring rivals. SUSIE'S KISS failed to respond. JUST LIKE MA had brief speed. GEORGE'S GIRL
chased the early pace and was through after a half. REBEL POWER broke in front and quickly opened a daylight lead, set the pace into the stretch, went
wrong before the furlong marker and was eased to the wire. FLAG BALL was never involved.
