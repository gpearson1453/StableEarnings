Footnotes
ALBERTA SUN broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the rail racing into the turn, resisted a rival's challenge racing into upper stretch
and narrowly prevailed in the closing stages in a grudging effort under firm left handed encouragement. CLICKBAIT tracked just off the leaders four wide on
the backstretch, advanced on the leaders three deep nearing upper stretch to challenge for command, struck the front midstretch but couldn't put the winner
away. FINAL FORM, in touch with the first flight three wide between foes in early stages, was eased off the pace entering the turn, shifted out four wide
racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to gain a share. EVEN PANDURA tracked off the first flight along the inside into the turn but offered no
closing bid. GIRLS A BULLET, in touch between foes in the first flight prompting the pace racing into the turn, gave way into upper stretch.

HENRY O'HENRY broke readily, sped clear while angling inside, dictated the pace on a clear margin to midstretch and just lasted under firm
encouragement. YESTERYEAR tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight racing into the turn, shifted a bit off the inside nearing the lane, angled
back to the inside steadily gaining terms with the winner, then ducked under pressure late while just edging a rival for a share at the wire. DERBYS
MONEYMAKER switched out three deep between foes early, was prompted in a steady advance in that path to upper stretch and moved to close the gap
on the winner while just missing for second. OTSEGO angled inwards to track just off the pacesetter between foes, led the second flight to upper stretch,
then weakened in late stages while caught in tight quarters nearing the wire. EVER ON COWBOY ducked inwards while being steadied at the start,
switched outside foes to race five deep, then four wide to the turn and gave way into the lane. RUN AWAY FLASH settled outside foes in early stages and
failed to menace. BERACUDA HEART, held up when caught in close quarters near the inside early, failed to menace.

Footnotes
WEEKEND RIDE broke readily, was urged to force the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, forged clear entering the turn, opened a
commanding advantage under pressure racing past midstretch and was gathered up late while extending the margin. THIRTYMINUTEMASS switched out
sharply to race four wide in early stages tracking off the second flight, continued off the inside to upper stretch, then angled inside rivals in the final sixteenth
to gain the place honors in time. AZUSA ST. angled in sharply tracking off the first flight racing into the turn, shifted out to race between foes past midstretch
but was outkicked for second. POVERTY FLATS tracked off the first flight between foes, was fanned four wide into upper stretch but had no rally. BOX
CANDY settled outside foes in early stages and failed to menace. WELL PRO, urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace in the opening quarter,
couldn't match that foe while continuing in pursuit into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. SIOUX VALLEY proved no factor.

H'RAYFORCABERNEIGH broke outwards bumping METAPHAR, was righted, then urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing
to the backstretch, met a rival's challenge leaving the far turn and drew clear late under firm right handed encouragement. PINK CHANNEL urged between
foes prompting the pacesetter to the backstretch, pressed the issue through the far turn but proved no match late. KISSMELIPS, forwardly placed three wide
tracking just off the first flight to the backstretch, was prompted in pursuit of those rivals to upper stretch but weakened late. METAPHAR, bumped at the
start, settled off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane but offered no rally. BRAHMS IS WHO settled outside foes racing to the first turn
and trailed throughout.

SOULANDGRACE, in touch with the first flight four wide in the opening stages attending the pace, pressed the issue three deep nearing upper stretch,
edged away to a clear advantage leaving midstretch and was kept to pressure. ROSEHILL ROAD, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset,
dueled for command inside the eventual winner into upper stretch but proved only second best. ADDED DIAMONDS, in touch with the first flight along the
inside in early stages, was eased off the pace avoiding tight quarters after the opening three sixteenths to track along the inside, shifted out three wide
nearing the lane but finished evenly late. HOLY SOUL settled last in early stages, angled inwards nearing the turn, shifted out approaching upper stretch
and continued with an effort to gain some position between foes. RINGAROUNDTHEROSIE settled outside foes in early stages, raced four wide to upper
stretch but had no rally. TIKA TOY dropped out early. HONORS HONOR broke slowly, was hustled up the rail disputing the pace into the turn but emptied
out nearing upper stretch.
