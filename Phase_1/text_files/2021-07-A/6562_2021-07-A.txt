STANS HOOKIN BULL was well placed throughout on the inside, moved out three wide leaving the quarter pole to make a bid, kicked clear in the stretch to
prove best under a drive. SILENCE D'ORO was keen early to set a fast pace while clear, then was headed entering the stretch and stayed on gamely for
the place. PAPAWS BOY was allowed to settle while three wide, came five wide into the drive to have a late rally. EASTER SNAP was reserved early, then
made a early move on the inside passed the three eighths pole, then was boxed and blocked by the five sixteenths, made a inside bid entering the stretch
when room, then angled out in deep stretch for racing room but hung. NANAS BOY broke outwardly at the start, then tracked the early pace three wide,
came four wide into the drive but had no punch. GOT NO KASH was settled back early, came six wide into the drive to have a belated rally. BONHAM was
allowed to settle towards the inside, then was between rivals on the far turn and weakened. HANDSOME LAD was not a factor.

Footnotes
SUNDAY BLING dawdled along setting a pressured pace on the inside, then was roused nearing the furlong marker and drew clear to prove best. KING
KONGO was rated along four wide down the backstretch, then made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole to loom boldly nearing the furlong marker, but
flattened out while being second best. SOLAR CITY chased the early pace in between horses down the backstretch, then was three wide passed the
quarter pole but was no late response while saving the show. RUNNIN THE RED was allowed to settle early on the inside, then was roused passed the
seven sixteenths pole and was five wide on the turn while advancing but came up empty in the drive, missed show. ANTONIOSGOLDRANGER tracked the
early pace on the inside and weakened. WHISKEY OVER ICE was four wide into the first turn, then pressed the winner three wide and made a bid on the
turn to go on even terms passed the five sixteenths but stopped.

VICE VERSA was well rated and made a three wide bid leaving the turn, drew clear final sixteenth to prove best under a drive. BIBLEMAN veered in after
the start, set unchallenged pace on the inside and was headed nearing the sixteenths pole and proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second
best. KOWBOY KARMA chased the early pace two wide, then raced between horses passed the quarter pole and was along for the show award. TIZ
ALLUPTOME NOW was allowed to settle early on the inside but had no rally. UNITED PATRIOT was allowed to settle early and was four wide by the
quarter pole but offered no rally. NOBLE EGYPTIAN clipped heels after start and stumbled losing the rider, walked off. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
INQUIRY CONCERNING THE RUN SHORTLY AFTER THE START, AND AFTER REVIEWING THE REPLAYS THEY DISQUALIFIED BIBLEMAN FROM
SECOND TO FIFTH PLACE FOR CAUSING SIXTH PLACE FINISHER NOBLE EGYPTIAN TO LOOSE HIS RIDER SHORTLY AFTER THE START.

Footnotes
BRITTS A CLOSER was rated along the inside, then advanced on the inside on the turn, moved out four wide to make a bid passed the three sixteenths
pole then kicked clear in the final furlong to prove bets under a drive. NEWSCASTER pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the turn to
gain a short advantage but was outfinished by the winner in the final furlong, second best. BANDIT SWANSON was reserved early on the inside and had a
mild rally to gain the show award. JUNGLE RUNNER was settled back early, swung out five wide for the drive to have a belated rally. EASILYUNBRIDLED
chased the pace three wide and weakened. AWE SHACKLE set a pressured pace on the inside and faded in the drive. FLEXATI was four wide into the first
turn, then settled in four wide down the backstretch and had no rally. JACKMAN reared at the start, not a factor.

Footnotes
TEXAS ASCOT QUEEN stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid between horses on the turn, then slowly edged away late to prove best under a
drive. MYSTERIOUS STAR set the pace from the inside, then came off the inside in the stretch while digging in gamely, but could not hold off the winner
late while saving the place gamely. DIAMONDS N ACES was allowed to settle early, worked her way to three wide passed the quarter pole, then closed the
gap well late having good energy. RUNNIN ON LOVE was allowed to settle early and made a mild rally on the inside but needed more. L L COOL GREY
chased the pace four wide and had no rally. MADAME RUE was reserved early, came five wide into the drive, then angled out widest in the stretch and
showed some late interest. SEA OF LIFE was allowed to settle while five wide then came up empty. RIVER HOP lacked a rally. LITESTER stalked the early
pace and made a four wide bid on the turn then weakened. CAUSE FOR LOVE failed to menace. SINGLE SATURDAY was fractious in the gate, not a
factor.
