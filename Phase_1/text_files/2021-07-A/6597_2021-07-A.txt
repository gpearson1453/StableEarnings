Footnotes
BALLYMORE STAR (IRE) forced the pace into the backstretch, moved closer and was a head off through the far turn, challenged at the top of the stretch
and drew clear under a hand ride. SWILLING got away a bit slowly then stalked the pace, came three then two-wide on the far turn, launched a determined
stretch drive was was just up for the place. LADY MOONSHINE was away a step slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on
the far turn and was all out through the stretch. WHO SAYS hit the gate leaving then stalked the pace from the rail, angled three-wide on the far turn while
chasing hard and finished gamely. BUTTERED TOAST was herded inward a bit leaving the gate, was three-wide on the first turn and hustled three and
four-wide on the far turn, tipped out upper stretch and chased gamely. BEAT THE SYSTEM led quickly and set a pressured pace, was joined in earnest at
the top of the stretch and was quickly headed and retreated without a chase.

position and stalked early, angled from the rail to three-wide late turn and finished gamely. AMERICAN INDY settled in mid pack, came three to five-wide on
the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. GWEN, away slowly, was hustled from off the pace, chased four to six-wide on the turn then finished
willingly between foes. BURLAP was steadied at the start, stalked the pace, lost her path when pinched back at the top of the stretch and evened out.
RAKASA led early, dueled on the backstretch, shook clear on the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch and tired. UMNEYAAT settled off the pace, was
hustled five-wide on the turn but flattened out in the stretch. THE RIDER ON BURLAP LODGED A CL;AIM OF FOUL AGAINST RIGHT TO FREEDOM AND

Footnotes
BELICHICK stalked early then closed up and forced the pace on the far turn, bid mid stretch, dueled to the end and was up with a late effort. TECUMSEH'S
WAR pressed the early pace, forced the issue on the backstretch, took command early on the far turn, was under serious pressure but shook clear at the
top of the stretch, was collared and battled through the final furlong and just missed. ENGLISH CONQUEROR stalked from the rail and two-wide, chased
into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. RELIABILITY was off slowly and settled in mid pack, closed three to five-wide on the turn then
chased through the stretch. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION was rated in mid pack, closed five-wide late turn, chased into the stretch and rallied outside.
STEPHEN, in striking range, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished with some interest. COLEYVILLE broke
slowly, gained position in range of the leaders, was hustled four-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. DESOLATOR raced from off the pace,
closed two to four-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. FLAME ZAPPER settled in mid pack, saved ground on both turns but failed to menace.
GUESTIMATION set a pressured pace, was headed early turn, dropped back to mid pack but tired in the final 16th. AWESOME WOK N ROLL settled off
the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
BENNY'S BUTTON showed speed and got clear to the lead, saved ground, came off of the rail at the top of the stretch and proved best. SUPER DUPER
stalked the pace while racing on the inside, chased the winner through the stretch but was a clear second best. LACOUGRA tracked the pacesetter, raced
two-wide on the turn and chased in vain through the stretch. OVERSTATE trailed the field, was still well back from the pack at the top of the stretch but
rallied well down the outside. SWEET EDITION bumped into LITTLE MISS CAT shortly after the start, took back early and offered a mild late rally. LITTLE
MISS CAT was bumped by SWEET EDITION shortly after the start, raced in midpack, angled three-wide at the 1/4 pole to launch a bid entering the stretch
but emptied out. CHASING DESTINY showed early speed, stalked the pace while racing three-wide but weakened midway around the turn. Race times
updated after data review.

Footnotes
ROGUE AFFAIR bumped by SWEEPIN HARD leaving the gate, forced the pace, bid into the far turn, dueled, edged ahead approaching the stretch and
moved clear then held under a drive. GREEN FLEET raced in mid pack, closed two to four-wide on the far turn, tipped out for the stretch drive and rallied
outside. AVOMAN raced in mid pack, closed four and five-wide through the final turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. H C HOLIDAY raced off
the pace, closed quickly two and three-wide on the turn then was all out through the stretch. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE raced in mid pack, was hustled from the
rail to three-wide on the turn then finished evenly along the fence. DANCERS GHOST stalked the pace, came two to four-wide through the far turn, chased
into the stretch but evened out in the late stages. POUND GREEN got away slowly and settled in mid pack, raced four-wide on the clubhouse turn then was
hustled four to six-wide on the far turn then lacked a closing response. KNOPFLER stalked the pace, raced three-wide throughout, dropped back on the far
turn and lacked a rally. AMMUNITION led into the first turn, set a pressured pace, was engaged early on the far turn, dueled, gave way near the top of the
stretch and retreated. SWEEPIN HARD broke outward and bumped ROGUE AFFAIR, settled off the pace, angled from two to four-wide through the final
turn but lacked a rally. EASY WEEKEND raced from off the pace, saved ground throughout and hustled through the far turn but tired in the stretch.
