DALIKA (GER) vied outside to the final turn, turned back a dueling rival, was challenged again in the stretch and responded very gamely edging away in the
final eighth.. LUCK MONEY settled outside, bid near the quarter pole, loomed a serious threat in midstretch but could not get by the winner. TEMPLE CITY
TERROR saved ground off the leaders, angled out in the stretch and rallied well but too late. LA DRAGONTEA (GB) broke slowest, chased wide and
continued willingly. BLAME DEBBIE was well placed in the clear behind dueling leaders and was finished by the final turn. HOTSY TOTSY (IRE) reserved
near the inside, was asked for run into the stretch but flattened out. MICHELINE rated well back, moved outside and lacked a rally. TONAL VERSE raced in
the two path much of the trip and faded after three quarters. CANDY FLOWER alternated for the advantage inside to the five sixteenths pole and stopped.

Footnotes
PHAT MAN reserved outside, moved strongly on the final turn, took the lead in the stretch and drew clear under a hand ride. MAGIC MICHAEL rated off the
leaders inside, awaited room near the quarter pole, angled out to secure room and rallied while no threat to the winner. DEAL DRIVEN vied outside
throughout and continued gamely to the finish. GALERIO dueled along the rail and finished well while weakening. HONOR THE FLEET was very rank under
rating into the first turn, chased three wide and faded. MIDNIGHT ACT dropped back between rivals and lacked a rally. DIXIE DRAWL broke slowest, raced
wide the faltered before half a mile and was always outrun.

BE SNEAKY settled outside, bid strongly into the stretch and edged away eagerly under moderate pressure. KASHAN moved clear inside, fought back
when challenged into the stretch and just held the place. BUTTER PECAN settled well back outside, moved very wide into the stretch rallying too late.
CONGRATSROSY raced at the back of the field, moved wide in the stretch while no threat. ELOQUENT SPEAKER urged close up inside the pacesetter
than proved empty in the stretch. BE PRESENT prompted the leader in the two path and gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
MISS MARISSA two wide briefly, angled to the rail on the first turn, controlled the pace through slow fractions, was urged at the quarter pole and gamely
repelled challenges from both sides under strong handling. GIBBERISH inside early, eased to the outside on the first turn, stalked the winner in hand, could
not get by in the stretch but continued willingly to gain the place. QUEEN NEKIA settled at the back of the field, angled three wide on the first turn, moved
back inside through the stretch and finished well. DREAM MARIE bumped early, angled wide on the first turn, remained wide and offered a mild bid.
BONNY SOUTH taken under hold between foes in the two path, was asked for run near the three eighths pole but had no response and faded..
SARACOSA bumped off stride early, rated close inside then stopped.

Footnotes
ENTERTAINMENT moved clear inside, widened into the stretch and remained safe while kept to his task. SEARCH FOR TRUTH trailed to the final turn,
angled out, moved very wide into the stretch and rallied nicely to gain the place. URBAN MYTH dropped back early then advanced near the inside without
threatening. OUT OF TOWNER raced close up outside and weakened through the stretch. LINDROS stalked the pacesetters in the clear, bid into the
stretch and tired. JUST DEAL WITH IT saved ground early and was never in contention. HODLER broke slowest, raced wide and was never a factor. FORE
ON SEVEN pressed the winner for three quarters and gave way.
