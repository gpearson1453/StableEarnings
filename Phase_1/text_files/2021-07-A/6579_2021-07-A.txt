Footnotes
MOHAYLADY stalked along the inside, slipped inside of the leader approaching the five sixteenths pole to produce a bid, drew off in upper stretch under
driving pressure, then widened under hand urging late. TIME TO CONFESS set the pace along the inside, but bore out approaching the five sixteenths pole,
which allowed for MOHAYLADY to produce a rail bid, proved no match for that foe turning for home, fended off JAMAICAN TRAFFIC for place through
midstretch before shying from left handed encouragement inside the final sixteenth, but maintained that position despite needing rider correction.
JAMAICAN TRAFFIC pressed the pace two wide, but proved no match for a rail bidding rival at the five sixteenths pole, chased TIME TO CONFESS
through the lane for place, but failed to reach her late. DIVA DIXIE was outrun.

Footnotes
ARTIE'S LADY stalked along the inside, smoothly tipped outside of the leader entering the lane to bid for the lead between horses passing the furlong pole,
dueled inside of MIDNIGHT LEWIS through the final furlong, and gamely prevailed. MIDNIGHT LEWIS tracked from midpack, tipped four wide turning for
home, rallied to bid outside of foes passing the furlong pole, dueled outside of ARTIE'S LADY through the late stages, but was denied. PRETTY BOY ELM
set the pace along the inside, bet a trio of bids approaching the furlong pole, but gave way to a pair of those rivals passing that marker, and managed show
to the wire. MALIBU MOONSTRUCK saved ground far off of the pace, and improved along the rail through the lane. SCHOCHOH stalked two to three wide,
bid for the lead between horses in upper stretch, but weakened passing the furlong grounds. CUZ settled off of the pace, swung five wide turning for home,
but failed to produce a rally. KICKIN' KIRBY threw his head and got rank at the start, trailed the field into the lane, and failed to factor. CLEARLY MAD
pressed two wide, but weakened between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
IKE quickly established a clear margin, widened that advantage around the far turn, and was ridden out to the wire. HERECOMESYOURMAN trailed in the
three path around the first turn, advanced position two wide into the far turn, held that path entering the lane to bid for place inside of a pair of foes
approaching the furlong pole, and edged away for that position through the late stages. RED ALERT tracked from midpack three wide, chased the clear
leader while under a drive around the far turn, then vied for place in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner foe for that position at the furlong pole, and
kept on. KILLEEN stalked two wide, chased the clear leader around the far turn, but weakened between horses through the final furlong. DEALIN' STELEN
lied off of the pace, trailed around the far turn, and failed to factor. BAQUERO FLIES stalked along the inside, but faded into the far turn, and was done
early.

Footnotes
ZIGGY'S STORM set the pace, drew off in upper stretch with FLORIS in pursuit, tired through the final furlong as that foe ranged up alongside, but lasted.
FLORIS tracked along the inside, slipped inside of foes to claim place at the five sixteenths pole, tipped outside of the clear leader in upper stretch, grinded
away at that foe's margin in the final sixteenth, but hung and missed. LIGHT SHIFT chased three wide, but failed to keep pace with the leading pair in upper
stretch, and kept on to secure show. SUNSET AT MALLORY stalked two wide, then from between horses at the five sixteenths pole, chased the leaders
after failing to keep pace with them in upper stretch. MAPPED OUT tracked from the two to three paths around the turn, but failed to make an impact. ONES
tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, but bolted to the six path straightening into the lane, and failed to mount a rally. CALLIE'S CANDY lied
off of the pace three wide, took the turn in the four path, and faded entering the lane. FOX CREEK LADY veered inwards at the start, and failed to factor
thereafter. MAKSIMOVIC was off slowly and got outrun.

SAPPHIRE ROYALTY dueled for the lead two wide, took over entering the lane, and drew off under driving pressure while hanging on her left lead. LADY
PROTONICO trailed along the inside, swung to the four path in upper stretch, produced a mild late kick outside of foes to bid for place on the wire, and just
got up. READY N WAITING dueled for the lead along the inside of SAPPHIRE ROYALTY, but proved no match for that foe entering the lane, tired through
the late stages, and got nailed for place. BLUE GRASS ANNA showed brief speed after a good start, chased along the inside around the turn, and faded
late. LELE stalked three wide, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
YIN YANG showed the way with a loose advantage down the backstretch, met BALI KUTA's bid into the far turn, inched slightly clear of that foe in upper
stretch, and held firm thereafter while that foe kept on. BALI KUTA stalked along the inside, bid outside of the leader with three furlongs to go, but was
turned away in upper stretch, kept on well to sustain the chase, progressed mildly approaching the wire, but did not have enough to catch her counterpart.
MAMA RINA tracked from midpack along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, and stayed on well to
catch an outer foe for show inside the final sixteenth. MISS CHAMITA settled off of the pace along the inside, advanced three wide around the far turn to
achieve show entering the lane, but failed to threaten the leaders before leveling off, then was outkicked by an inner foe for show in the late stages. FLORA
was slow away and trailed the field into the far turn, swung five wide entering the lane, and improved without menacing. MURGATROYD stalked two wide,
but was outmoved by an inner bidding foe into the far turn, and faded around that bend. GREEDY ALGORITHM tracked three wide, tucked to the rail to
chase the leading pair around the far turn, but faded through the lane. DUTCH CLOVER got caught four wide off of the pace, but faded around the far turn
and was done early. BAYTOWN LYLA lied far off of the pace in the three to five paths, and was done early.

Footnotes
PALM COTTAGE stalked comfortably along the inside, smoothly tipped outside of the dueling pair entering the lane, ranged up to them passing the furlong
pole, and prevailed under a long drive. STRONG SILENT dueled for the lead two wide, fought gamely between horses through the final furlong, but was
bested by an outer rival. UPANDCOMINGSTAR was sent early on to duel for the lead inside of STRONG SILENT, gamely clung to a minor advantage
inside of that foe and a bidding PALM COTTAGE leaving the furlong grounds, but was bested late. SOUTH GEORGIA broke a step slowly and steadied
back between horses soon after, gained in the three path around the turn from far off of the pace, claimed fourth from a group of outer foes in upper stretch,
then chased the leading trio home well. ON THE RISE broke a bit outwardly, gained in the four path around the turn from off of the pace, but flattened out in
upper stretch. PEYTON'S COLLEGE lied far off of the pace in the three to four path, and failed to factor. CLAWBACK stalked three wide, but was outmoved
by an inner foe entering the lane, and weakened in upper stretch. WICKED KITTY tracked the pace two wide and from between horses, but backed out at
the three furlnog pole, and steadily faded thereafter. ANGELS OVER ME was outrun. THE GIRLS briefly chased three wide while close to the pace, but
faded after a furlong and an a half, and was done early.

Footnotes
PETTIGO GIRL got hung in the five path into the first turn, tucked to the four path around that bend, chased the pace, was off the rail into the lane, made a
bid near the eighth pole, edged past the leader near the sixteenth pole and held off rival in the final stages. FOREVER HOME raced on the inside along the
first turn while back early, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane but did not have enough in the final stages. GRAN CHEMIN raced in the
three path along the first turn and set the early pace, was on the inside into the lane, gave in near the sixteenth pole, yielded in the final stages and held
show. WINZE chased the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch with a mild gain in the late stages. INCESSANT raced
back early on, was off the rail into the lane with a minor gain in the stretch run. GRACIANA stalked the pace early, raced in the four path along the first turn,
was in the four path entering the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. JAWHARA was a step slow at the start and no factor thereafter. TEMPLE BELLE
raced in the four to three path along the first turn, was in the five path into the lane and empty down the lane.
