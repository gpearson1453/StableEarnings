Footnotes
ROCK ON COWBOY took command along the inside into the first turn, rated while showing the way up the backstretch, continued in hand far turn, clear into
the stretch and then maintained a daylight advantage to the wire under steady handling. JUSTA SWINGING settled off the pace along the inside behind the
winner, continued to stalk that one the middle half, moved off the inside when advancing slightly closer late in the final turn, lugged in upper stretch, could
not get to the victor in the run to the wire, well clear of the rest. LUNDI used a bit to maintain a forward position while four wide into the first turn, closest to
the winner in the run up the backstretch, had little left for the top two through the lane, enough to save the show late. OUR BUCKET LIST one paced in the
second flight early, continued in even fashion while moving a bit closer for the third position midstretch, flattened out. TRITT last to leave, fell further back
before a quarter, continued to lag far turn, picked off a single tiring rival through the stretch while never a factor. R AND R STAR four wide when with the
main body into the first turn, gave way after five furlongs, finished far back.

HAIL STATE popped stall doors prestart, broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside up the backstraight and into the turn, shook off the other speed when
entering the stretch, clear past the furlong marker and extended that advantage in strong fashion to the wire. FATHER GOOSE in the second flight while
racing outside, three wide into the lane, set down for the drive and closed with good resolve to be up late for the place, no threat to the winner.
SATURDAY'S GOLD back off the pace while between foes, steadied and fell back in continued traffic into the turn, advanced into the stretch, closest to the
winner with a furlong to run, caught late for the second spot. CHASIN GRACIE set the early pace inside, a bit rank late backstretch, dueled with the winner
into and through most of the turn, weakened in the drive. FULL POWER off slowly, trailed most of the way and never menaced. HOSTILE AFLEET in the
second group early along the inside, in some traffic turning for home while continuing along the rail, faded through the lane.

LATE NITE MISCHIEF close up from the start, alternated up front while off the inside, continued to duel into and through the final turn, three path into the
lane, continued long drive, just held late. THAT'S D 'CAT also with the pace from the start, dueled inside, fell back off the winner a bit past the furlong
marker, proved tenacious to the end to narrowly miss in a game effort. THETRASHMANSCOMING last to leave, moved up to race in the second flight on
the outside before a half, came four wide into the lane, slowly getting to the top two late. HUNTERS APPEAL settled off the pace toward the inside, crept
closer in the two late in the final turn to be between the top two into the stretch, flattened out in the drive. FLASHY IMAGE forwardly placed early off the
inside, fell back before a half and went one paced thereafter in lacking a closing response. NO PLANS raced in mid pack, failed to muster a response when
called on for the drive. CAJUN CASH failed to menace with a four wide trip throughout.

Footnotes
BALOOK broke back, raced unhurried for five furlongs, moved closer through some traffic late in the final turn, steered out five wide into the straight for
room, challenged just outside the furlong grounds, strongly clear. QUIET BARBARA raced in mid pack while racing off the inside, moved closer while
outside the winner late in the final turn, floated out six wide by that one into the stretch, proved no match the final furlong, game for the place.
GOTTABEGOLDEN last to leave, continued to be void of speed for five furlongs, advanced second turn, brief wait in traffic late in final turn, continued in
traffic upper stretch, steered in past the furlong marker and finished up willingly late. MISS MIRACLE GIRL mid pack while toward the inside, closer in the
two path final turn, traffic late in that bend, brush upper stretch, mild bid, lacked late punch. STREAMER behind the pace while off the inside, closer three
wide second turn, brushed upper stretch, flattened out to finish up evenly. RACELYNN underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, broke well, set the pace for
over six furlongs along the inside, faltered when headed in upper straight. FASHION MERIT pressed the leader from the outside, dueled with that one into
the lane, briefly put a head in front when straightened for home, also gave way when the real running began. A WISH FOR MADELYN in the main body
while racing outside, six wide into the lane, failed to rally. TETHEREDTOTHETRUTH within striking distance for a half, tired from those early efforts.
CRIDER CHASE prompted the pace outside, gave way when four wide in the second turn.

Footnotes
MISTY DAY allowed the two leaders to go early toward the inside, advanced on that pair in the three path turning for home, collared those foes soon after,
drew well clear under steady handling. SOUTHERN LIAISON in the second flight while racing outside, oved with the winner on the leaders late in the turn
outside that one, four wide into the lane, no match final furlong, clearly second best. MAYBE I CAN dueled up front in the two path through some quick early
fractions, weakened in the drive. MISS PAT'S GIRL last to leave, trailed most of the way, five wide into the lane, made little impact in passing a single tiring
rival. LADY HOPPER helped set a quick opening quarter closest to the inside, garnered a larger advantage in the turn then caved when confronted in upper
stretch. .

Footnotes
CALCULATE pressed the leader while off the inside, challenged and put a head in front late in the final turn, responded when confronted by the runner up
soon after while outside that rival, dug in late in finding more to prove best in determined fashion. MUSCADINE lacked early foot while saving ground, began
a steady advance after a half while continuing inside, challenged inside the winner entering the stretch, long drive to the wire, outkicked late. PAYNT
BATTLE settled off the pace and the inside, asked along three wide late in the final turn, could do little with the top two the final furlong, clearly best of the
others. MISS JENNY'S HALO broke alertly, set the pace for almost six furlongs, began to weaken when headed by the winner late in the final bend.
HOMELAND MESSA forwardly placed, shuffled back in some traffic into the far turn, dropped inside, improved while saving ground into the stretch, finished
up evenly. POPPI IS SMILING lacked early speed, improved a bit with a tepid four wide middle move, flattened out in the drive. CARRIES MAN last away,
raced outside, five wide into the far turn, came up empty for the stretch run. HOMEBRED in mid pack, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
KING OF THE TESTO with the pace through the first turn in the two path, dueled in the run up the backstretch closest to the inside, narrowly showed the
way into the stretch, long drive to the wire, proved best in determined fashion late while fully extended. GENTRIFIED four wide when prompting the pace
four wide through the first turn, continued to force the issue from the outside in the run up the backstretch, closer with an outside bid late in the final turn,
could not outkick the winner the final furlong, narrowly saved the second spot. LIGHTHAWK back off the pace while inside, continued to save ground
through the second turn when moving a bit closer, behind some traffic turning for home, remained inside, outfinished for the place. MISCHIEVOUS BULL
lacked early foot three wide through the first turn, continued back, briskly roused for the drive, lacked a significant closing response. PINCH ASSAULT last
to leave, trailed early, came on the outside for the drive, also lacked a closing kick. GREELEY'S DEALER three wide when with the pace through the first
turn and between foes, dueled with the winner up the backstretch and into the far turn, gave way from between horses entering the stretch.

Footnotes
NET A BEAR last away, settled along the inside, asked along far turn while continuing to save ground, challenged inside the pace setter when straightened
for home, edged clear the final furlong under steady handling. OFFSPRING lacked speed off the inside, came from between horses into the stretch, steered
out a bit for room, slowly getting to the winner late. CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR broke on top, clear in showing the way through the first turn, continued to set the
pace the middle half, allowed the winner the inside entering the straight, dueled with that one past the furlong marker then began to give ground grudgingly,
caught late for the place. RAGING GOLD DIGGER closest to the early leader, pressed that one the middle half, lodged a brief bid late in the final turn then
weakened through the stretch. SNOWBALL forwardly placed while racing in the three path, had little left for the stretch run. QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL
TIME UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
FORTHELOVEOFLUCY broke well, dueled up front while off the inside, disposed of the other speed to be clear into the lane, maintained daylight to the
finish under a firm right handed crop. EPONHER forwardly placed toward the inside early, steered out when moving a bit closer turning for home, continued
a slow advance on the winner the final furlong, clearly second best. MADELYN'S MOMENT in the main body toward but not on the inside, continued in the
two path into the lane, clearly finished up best of the rest. AMBER PASS broke on top, dueled inside the winner, first to blink turning for home, gradually
weakened. CRAPAUD in the main body while racing outside, roused four wide into the lane, lacked a serious kick. GRACE'S GAL broke back, continued to
lack speed, improved position through the lane while not posing serious threat. DOUBLE APPEAL lacked speed off the inside, was never dangerous.
FROIDEUR broke with the leaders, within striking distance, had little for the drive. ST JOAN saved ground to no avail. G G'S WRECKINGBALL off a step
slow, remained always back. SUNDAY'S GIFT in the second flight early, steadied in some traffic midway on the turn, fell quickly back.
