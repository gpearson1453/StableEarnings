on the turn and was all out through the stretch. BRASS COMPASS held a short early lead, set a pressured pace, was headed a furlong out and chased to
the end. SEAU had brief speed then forced the pace, bid a furlong out but was no match and evened out late. BAY OF RUM rated up close early, was
hustled from the rail on the turn then flattened out in mid stretch. DRENA'S BULLET was steadied at the outset and settled off the pace, was hustled two to
four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. SURE WOULD FOREST stalked the pace, came two and three-wide on the turn and

Footnotes
UNDER THE EYE got a perfect trip behind three duelers, angled out after the pace survivors had separated themselves by midway on the far turn, loomed
three to four wide turning for home, drove to the front at the eighth pole and held gamely to the wire. ALTERNATIVE VIEW off the pace and three to two
wide on the first turn, closed into range while two to four wide on the far turn, out in the seven path turning for home and closed resolutely outside for the
place spot in a tight three-way finish. SAVVY'S SISTER was four wide in the second tier chasing the three duelers around the first turn, up to press the pace
survivor on the second turn and got by that one late in the stretch but the top pair outkicked her, gamely holding the show spot despite the wide trip.
BLUEYED PRINCESS settled inside in mid pack, came off the rail midway on the far turn and followed the winner into the stretch, but could not match that
one's energy and settled for a minor award, still inching up at the wire. BIG CHEEKS was off to a sluggish beginning, off the pace and three to five wide on
the first turn, rallied three to five wide outside the eventual place finisher on the far turn, out in the eight path in upper stretch, closing ground but not with as
much determination as some others. ECHO IN THE FOREST broke slow and was near the rear while four to three wide around the first turn, came up the
rail on the far turn and drifted out turning for home before diving back to the rail, putting in a nice run to get near the leaders without threatening. SHE'S A
TRUE FOX was three wide and pressing two inside rivals around the first turn, got the front into the far turn and was pressed by a stalker around the bend
and into the stretch, tiring and dropping back inside the final furlong. VINYASA off the pace and four to two wide on the first turn, came two to four wide from
the back on the far turn and angled out in upper stretch, closing noticeably in the final furlong. INTRICATELY pressed along the inside by two rivals, lost the
lead midway on the backstretch and began to drop back around the far turn, drifted off the fence in upper stretch when tiring and lost positions late. SWEET
SHADES sat outside the eventual winner in behind the duelers throughout, but couldn't match that one's energy and faded down the stretch. SENORITA
UNO press the leader between rivals until midway on the backstretch, dropping back gradually from that point.

BELLA NINA settled in mid pack, rode the rail on the turn, gained the lead in the final furlong and drew off under a hand ride. MAKE NO MISTAKE stalked
the pace, closed three-wide on the turn, bid upper stretch and shook clear briefly but was passed in the final furlong. ALICE'S WAR bumped with THE
ADRIE FACTOR leaving the gate, settled off the pace, closed two to four-wide through the turn, was up close upper stretch but was outkicked. CLOSE
IMAGE raced in mid pack, angled from two to four-wide on the turn, rallied widest but failed to menace. LINE OF VISION, away slowly and off the pace,
saved ground on the turn, encountered traffic briefly at the top of the stretch, angled to the outside but failed to menace. THE ADRIE FACTOR, bumped at
the start, showed rated speed, shook clear briefly late backstretch, set the pace, was headed upper stretch and faded. GOOD TO ME raced in mid pack
early then settled off the pace, came two and three-wide through the tur but lacked a rally. TIZ MY RIGHT dueled early, forced the pace into the turn,
dropped back a bit and lacked a closing response.

SO ELUSIVE in range early, closed up to force the pace on the backstretch, bid with a furlong to run and was all out to prevail. USING COCONUTS raced in
mid pack, chased four-wide late turn then closed through the stretch and was gaining late. ITSKATHIESLUCKYDAY had early speed, set a pressured pace
through the backstretch and turn then gave way grudgingly in deep stretch. SKY OF DREAMS was pinched back at the start the closed to mid pack, was
hustled along the rail through the turn and finished under a determined drive. SMARTY ILLUSION broke outward then settled in mid pack, raced three and
four-wide on the clubhouse turn then was hustled four and five-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and rallied belatedly. MOONLIT SILENCE was
herded outward leaving the gate and settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide chasing on the far turn and rallied mildly through the stretch.
SUSPICIOUS MINDS in touch, chased hard three-wide on the far turn then evened out in the final furlong. FANCYSOUL was checked leaving the gate and
settled off the pace, saved ground but was never in contention. POINCIANA raced in mid pack, chased two to four-wide on the far turn then evened out in
the stretch. JUNGLE GODDESS was up close behind a rival early on the first turn and had to steady, backed off just a little and stalked the pace to the
stretch but lacked a rally. SHE TAKES FLIGHT broke outward and settled in mid pack, dropped back on the far turn then lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
MIGHTY HEART led early and set a very reserved pace, was engaged midway through the far turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch and held sway
under light handling. MARCH TO THE ARCH rated early, moved up to force the issue early backstretch, bid in earnest mid turn, was headed at the top of
the stretch and had to put away MALIBU MOMBO in the late stages to hold the place. MALIBU MAMBO stalked the pacesetter, chased determinedly two to
four-wide on the far turn, was up close at the top of the stretch but did not get his bid off, battled for the place position but gave way late. LOOKIN TO
STRIKE stalked the pace, came along the rail and two-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch but finished evenly. SKYWIRE got off a step slowly
and settled at the back of the pack, was hustled three-wide on the far turn but never reached contention.
