HUMPDAY broke sluggishly, unhurried along the two path, gained inside into the lane, responded to take the lead and then lost the whip late while still
getting the job done. BEACH PASS tracked along the rail after a half mile, two path on the last turn, three path into the lane, responded and proved best on
the line. BOSTON BILLY never far back along the three path, four wide on the turn, five wide out of it and finished well while wide. LIAMS MAJESTY broke
sharply, set the pace along the two path around the turns, was hooked leaving the furlong marker, battled on and weakened late. MERCEDES JOE tracked
along the two path, four wide into the lane and tired. EGON SPENGLER broke slow, unhurried five wide leaving the first turn and then saved ground on the
last turn while tiring.

Footnotes
UNWAVERING set the pace along the two path, opened up when roused and was ridden out. BLIZZ hopped at the start, lagged back, two path on the turn,
responded when asked and split rivals while in gear. HIS BOY ELROY well placed, tracked along the rail on the turn, chased and weakened. ALWAYS
FUNNY in hand along the three path, angled out and finished with interest. LORCAN tracked along the three path on the turn and tired. DOUBLE D DAY
broke slow, two path on the turn and then was no threat inside.
