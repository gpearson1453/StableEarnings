WEST COAST TEMPLE had good position early on the inside, awaited room on the far turn, angled out three wide in the stretch, closed determinedly and
drew off. RHODA'S JEWELL pressed the early pace and dueled on the lead, was no match late for the winner but was second best. SALTED REVENGE
set the early pace and dueled on the lead, weakened in late stretch. MAGESTAL BASTIDA was never far back, lacked a late response and went evenly.
SHE'S FLASHY saved ground and was no menace. PLAYFULMISSSAMURAI contended for three quarters, then gave way in the stretch.

BUGLER had good position on the inside, angled out at the top the stretch off the rail, split horses at the three sixteent pole, drew clear late under strong
handling. CONTRACTOR BILL set the pace with a clear lead under moderate fractions, was hooked in mid stretch, held stubbornly and was second best.
HOLDTHEFLIGHT was well placed while three wide rallied at the quarter pole and drew close, finished willingly but could not gain on the top two.
DANTRUM chased the speed until mid stretch, then weakened. MAN DOWN allowed to settle, failed to menace. REAL MAN was well placed early and tired
after three quarters. WILY WARRIOR was no factor. SUPER D'ORO stumbled at the start and trailed.

Footnotes
JOHNNY C chased early rallied on the turn and drew even, battled through the stretch and prevailed late, driving. GOOSEISONTHELOOSE set the early
pace, was hooked at the quarter pole, held gamely after a long stretch battle and was clearly second best. ELLADA PINOT was never far back, had a mild
bid three wide while no threat to the top two. MY TICKET raced between horses early then faltered. FRESHWATER PIRATE had good position on the
inside, lacked a late response. DUNROAD was no factor. HONKY TONK MUSIC outrun.
