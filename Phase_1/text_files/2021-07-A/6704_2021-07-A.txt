Footnotes
SHIPS JEWEL sprinted clear, held well into the stretch and was always in command under token encouragement. DELIGHT SURPRISE outpaced early,
advanced on the turn and finished willingly in the stretch. REBA chased the pace, moved closer on the turn and stayed on in the stretch. ADD IT ALL UP
outrun early, responded in the stretch and managed a belated rally. JUSTIN'S GIRL never menaced. YOU JUST WATCHME off slowly, recovered to chase
the pacesetter and weakened in the late going. OUR DOUBLE DIAMOND was void of speed and proved no factor. BREA was always outrun. LULUS
FLIGHT BOOTS forced the pace and faltered.
