Footnotes
MAUREENLOVESFRANK stalked close up two wide, bid entering the far turn, took charge, then turned back a bid from HONOR YOUR MOTHER,
responded when roused, pulled away under urging and coasted the final yards. HONOR YOUR MOTHER staked the pace, moved up on the far turn, rallied
into the stretch, dug in gamely but came up second best. IZZYBELLA set the pace on the inside, briefly dueled with the winner on the far turn, weakened
and bested the others. HELLO ROSIE SAY raced off the pace inside, came wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. FRED'S SHEILA raced off the rail,
off the pace, chased the leaders on the far turn and failed to respond. SPRITE'S LADY raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
