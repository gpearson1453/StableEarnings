Footnotes
CLYDE PARK chased the pace from the four path into the stretch, closed willingly while drifting out to the six path and was along in time. SMOKIN HOT
ENERGY settled in the six path, closed fast through the final sixteenth, angled inside the winner to the four path and was steadily cutting into that ones
advantage. SOUTHERN SPIRIT drifted to the six path leaving the chute while making the lead, was corrected, set the pace with a clear lead and was
outfinished in the final stages. BEAUTIFUL GAME failed to menace. LOVEATTURKEYCLUB was no factor. POWER SONG chased the pace along the
inside and was through after a half.

MR LIGHTNING BOY prompted the pace two wide, made the lead, on the turn, was headed before the furlong marker, fought back gamely and got back up
in time. TARTAN THE BULL close up from the start, surged along the inside into the stretch, gained a narrow lead before the furlong marker, maintained
that advantage until the final yards but finished second best. FAHRENHEIT stalked the pace four then three wide and went evenly. SUPER VALENTINE
failed to menace. TIP SHEET was no threat. NOBLE BEHAVIOR was no factor. LOCK ON was always outrun. FELON set the early pace along the inside
and stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
BLANDA broke inward, was unhurried while saving ground along the rail, got through to engage the leaders in upper stretch, battled to the wire and proved
best in a game effort under right handed urging. VICTORY DIVISION stalked the early pace, rallied four wide into the stretch, gained a short lead, matched
strides to the wire but finished second best. BRINK POINT was bumped then squeezed between horses at the start, trailed into the stretch then closed
rapidly five wide. MUSTANG WILLIE stumbled then bumped at the start, moved up three wide approaching the top of the stretch, lacked the needed room
then leveled. FIRST SONG was antsy in the gate prior to the start, dueled for the lead along the inside for a half then gave way. CAT HEAT stumbled inward
bumping BRINK POINT at the start, prompted the pace two then three wide into the stretch and stopped. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN
BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
MISS MISCHIEVOUS stalked the pace into the stretch, responded readily when set down, made the lead at the top of the stretch and finished full of run
under a hand ride to win going away. STAR MABEE pressed the pace along the inside and was no match for the winner. PANAMANIAC away alertly, set a
pressured pace to the top of the stretch then gradually weakened. SOLE FACTOR passed tiring rivals. HEAVEN SENT ANGEL well placed, failed to
respond. DRUMBEG drifted in bumping GRINS N' WINS at the start and had brief speed. GRINS N' WINS was bumped at the start and outrun.
