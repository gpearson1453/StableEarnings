WHERESHETOLDMETOGO stalked the pace outside, moved easily to the pacesetter near the quarter pole, drifted in through the stretch and lugged in
badly while pulling away. ALWAYS SUNSHINE hustled to the front inside, battled when hooked then weakened late. GOLDEN CANDY broke slowest,
chased outside and rallied mildly through the stretch. THREES OVER DEUCES angled inside through the opening quarter and lacked a rally.
SPEIGHTSFORD prompted the pace in the two path and faltered in the stretch. CLASSY SOLUTION dropped back early and trailed throughout.

final furlong. WOOTTON ASSET (FR) dropped back early, moved closer on the final turn then went evenly late. DOUBLEOSEVEN was reserved at the
back of the pack then rallied mildly too late. EAMONN prompted the pace outside, challenged the winner on the final turn then faded in the stretch. BE

Footnotes
CRAZY BEAUTIFUL reserved outside the dueling leaders, swept to the lead when ready at the top of the stretch and drew off under moderate urging.
MIDNIGHT OBSESSION settled inside, advanced on the final turn, swung wide into the stretch, rallied but was no match for the winner. LEADER OF THE
BAND broke slowest and trailed early, then picked off rivals late while no threat. HYBRID ECLIPSE prompted the pace outside, led at the five sixteenths
pole, was collared by the winner then weakened. SHE A HOT MESS dropped back outside then offered some late energy. ORBS BABY GIRL set a clear
pace for five furlongs; was collared on the final turn and tired. BABY GUNDIN lacked speed wide, moved closer before half a mile and faded. JUROR
NUMBER FOUR raced in midpack between rivals and faced on the final turn. EXOGEN .saved ground early then began faltering after half a mile.

Footnotes
TAKINGTIMEOFF moved clear under rating; maintained her advantage then held rivals safe through the stretch while kept to a drive. INDIAN HEART
dropped back outside, advanced very wide into the stretch and gained too late. PRUNING settled close up inside, angled out in the stretch and continued
willingly. FARCICAL settled off the leaders, advanced inside but was outfinished. LEGITIMATELY trailed early then passed fading rivals. BAY B saved
ground close up and stopped abruptly. IMMENSE prompted the pace outside to the final turn, stopped suddenly, was eased in the stretch and vanned off.
