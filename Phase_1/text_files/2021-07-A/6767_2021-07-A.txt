Footnotes
MS MICHELLE was never far back, raced wide, closed steadily, got up near the sixteenth pole and drew clear under steady urging. SEVEN POINTS stalked
the pace while racing outside, challenged for the lad on the turn, dueled to the sixteenth pole and was outclosed. EASY DOES IT pressed the pace,
challenged between horses on the turn, dueled to the sixteenth pole, faltered and settled for show. CRIMINAL RECORD was off a step slowly, was hustled
along to stalk the pace while saving ground and flattened out on the turn. TOSSAPENNYDOWN set the pace to the second turn, tired and stopped.
OUTRAGEOUS LADY saved ground and lacked a response. Hand timed.

SWEET RYAN pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to mid stretch and held off the late charge of SARAH'S STAR to just last at the
wire. SARAH'S STAR pressed the pace while racing along the rail, shifted out on the turn, bid five wide, closed willingly and just missed. HAIL ON HOOFS
set the pace, responded when challenged to duel to mid stretch, faltered and held for show. FAITH IN EXCESS raced mid pack, failed to rally and did not
threaten. MERITTRIS was not a factor. FOXY CARMELA pressed the pace to the turn and gave way. FILTHY was outrun. Hand timed.

Footnotes
FABULOUS FLOYD rallied on the turn, assumed command, inched clear, drifted out in the drive and held well. MAJOR DAYLIGHT raced close to the pace,
closed steadily, couldn't gain on the winner and finished second best. LUCKY ROCKET pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, continued
under steady urging and got up late for show. UNCONSCIOUS POWER set a pressured pace to the turn, leveled off and lost position. CAPITAL REEF
raced in the back, went widest in the drive and lacked a bid. KIJANI trailed the field. The fractional split of 4504 was removed. Hand timed.
