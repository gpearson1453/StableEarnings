on the wire. UNMARKED MONEY saved ground in midpack, advanced two wide around the far turn, angled four wide near the quarter pole, rallied outside,

a half, chased inside around the far turn and weakened in the lane. BELLA GABRIELLA failed to menace while racing two and three wide. HARDLY
SOCIAL stalked the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. MAMMA J was bumped just after the start, had some speed inside
while pulling around the first turn, remained in range two wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. FOR EVER OURS was pushed out a bit at
the start and bumped with MAMA J, raced four and five wide and played no further factor. SWEET ACTRESS was outrun while racing four wide. KAMALA

Footnotes
FACE OF VICTORY set the pace along the rail, angled to the three path turning for home and drew off under a drive. WICKED TEMPTATIONS bumped
with DIZZY GILLESPIE at the start, was pinched back soon after leaving the chute, trailed outside, advanced four wide around the turn, continued on the left
lead in the lane and finished willingly to gain the place. DIZZY GILLESPIE was bumped at the start, checked off the winner's heels and lost action early,
saved ground in midpack, moved into a clear second in upper stretch but weakened late. DR HARLAN failed to menace while racing two wide.
AREYOUTALKINGTOME tracked the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and came up empty. JUST THE FACTS pressed the winner two
wide and retreated through the lane. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF DIZZY GILLESPIE AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE

RIVETING SPIRIT saved ground allowed to settle in midpack for a half-mile, moved off the inside rallying past the quarter-pole, responded with a solid
finishing kick and ran down TWIRLING GRACE from outside. TWIRLING GRACE pursued LOOKING FOR LOVE up the backstretch, went after that one
from outside midway on the far turn, took over at the top of the stretch, shook away to a clear advantage through the furlong grounds, but could not deny her
stablemate in the closing yards. FORBIDDEN DREAM hugged the rail around the turns, shifted out with a mild rally coming to the eighth-pole, then ran on
evenly to be clear of the remainder. BELLE'S KINGDOM raced in or around the three-path much of the way, got a bit closer to the leaders through the
middle stages, then flattened out. PRINCESS KYLISE was slow into stride and lagged well back to the far turn, and passed tired horses. DANZATALE was
finished early three wide. LOOKING FOR LOVE set the pace inside, could not hold off TWIRLING GRACE after six furlongs, and gave way. THATS ALL
SHEWROTE raced forwardly three wide for six furlongs, and had nothing left.

Footnotes
SILVERLY ENOUGH settled off the early pace outside, advanced three wide around the turn, steadily gained through the lane, put a head in front near the
sixteenth pole and edged ahead under left-handed urging. INTER MIAMI set a clear pace inside, yielded near the sixteenth pole but fought on inside of the
winner to hold well clear of the rest. SIR KAHN lacked early speed, raced three wide and was along for the show. VICTORY CRUSADE saved ground and
failed to menace. FUNDY'S TIDE stalked the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. AMOR LEJANO (ARG) had some speed inside, dropped back
around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and continued to retreat.

Footnotes
TAMMANY was slowest to begin but quickly tugged her way through between horses to gain command, saved ground settling down with the lead around
the first turn, repelled a challenge from TREASURE TAILS around the far turn, kicked clear again through the furlong grounds and held firm. IRAZU was
unhurried inside at the back for a half-mile, swung widest coming off the far turn, found her best stride past the furlong marker despite lugging in a bit from
right-hand pressure, and was up for the place outside rivals. KITTEN'S ROMANCE stayed in range for six furlongs, cut the corner into the stretch, and
needed more along the rail. TREASURE TAILS pressed TAMMANY around the first turn and up the backstretch, challenged from outside after six furlongs,
was turned away in upper stretch and weakened. LEA RO went along in striking range three wide to the stretch, and faded under pressure. HAPPY
THOUGHT was no factor inside. GLOVANNA raced two to three wide on the turns, and tired in the stretch.

JEWISH GUILT settled off the early pace outside, advanced three wide around the turn, seized command turning for home and edged ahead under a drive.
SINGLE LADY vied two wide between foes to upper stretch, shifted in a bit and fought on inside of the winner through the lane. SETTLER was in range
inside, steadied near the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground in behind the battling leaders around the turn, angled out leaving the quarter pole, made a
mild gain outside and lugged in while shifting back to the left lead leaving the sixteenth pole. LUCKY EMILIA was reluctant to load and failed to menace
while racing two wide. SECRET PRIZE was outrun inside. MOON LADY stumbled at the start, rushed up to take the lead nearing the half-mile pole, cleared
and angled nearing the turn, vied inside to upper stretch and tired. STREAKING GREY was outrun while racing three wide.

BETWEEN DREAMS pursued INCLUDE THE BEAST from inside, got through on the rail to challenge in upper stretch, gained the upper hand past the
eighth-pole and outfinished GOODBYE GABY for the decision. GOODBYE GABY pressed the pace in the three-path, had aim outside turning for home, and
ran on with good courage to go clear for the place. INCLUDE THE BEAST set the pace in the two-path, weakened leaving the furlong grounds and was
overtaken from both sides. LEYENDA raced four wide in range for a half-mile, but had no final response. RACE DAY SPEED moved off the rail to the
three-path midway on the turn, and lacked a rally. LIGHTS ON GIRL stayed close early, then faded steadily two wide. EVERTHREE was slow into stride,
and remained outrun inside. CAJUN LADY got shuffled back a bit up the backstretch and again past the half-mile pole, and brushed with ASTROMELIA
while both were well out of it turning for home. ASTROMELIA raced five wide throughout, and brushed with CAJUN LADY while far back at the top of the
stretch. GONE TO CABO raced between horses to the turn, and dropped back steadily. MADAME BARRISTER retreated around the turn three wide.

out late and lasted. PASSION PLUS settled off the pace along the inside, swung four wide in upper stretch, made a mild rally outside while sticking on the
left lead through most of the stretch, switched over with about seventy yards to go, kicked in and just missed. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN stalked the pace from
the rail, angled three wide in upper stretch, rallied between foes under constant left-handed urging and was narrowly outkicked. WONDER BLONDY
hesitated at the start, raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied belatedly. LADIES' CHOICE set the pace along the rail to midstretch and weakened.
LITTLE BIT GOOD was outrun while racing two and three wide. AIZU tracked the pace three wide and faded in the lane. TIZ ENOUGH was outrun inside.

Footnotes
NOBLE DRAMA was devoid of speed up the backstretch, settled suddenly and began making up ground rapidly five wide past the three-eighths pole,
sustained the momentum rallying through the stretch, caught the leaders from outside 70 yards out and drew clear. I'M A G SIX set the pace inside, lost the
advantage to PRO QUALITY through upper stretch still on his left lead, switched to his correct lead late and battled back gamely for second. PRO QUALITY
took a couple awkward strides midway up the backstretch, was taken off the rail and resumed chasing after I'M A G SIX, reached a short lead from outside
that rival after six furlongs, battled through the furlong grounds up front, then weakened in the final stages. QUENANE advanced mildly after six furlongs in
the two-path, but could not sustain the rally. JESUS' TEAM broke out into HIGHESTDISTINCTION, stayed close early, and was empty after a half-mile four
wide. SOLE VOLANTE moved in from the two-path midway on the turn, and faded steadily into the stretch. HIGHESTDISTINCTION was brushed and
pushed out by JESUS' TEAM at the break, recovered and showed early speed, but was finished entering the turn. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED;
SEVEN-FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
SASSY CAT set a clear pace inside, widened in upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging and held clear. EMPEROR'S SONG raced two wide in
midpack, tipped three wide turning for home, continued on the left lead in the lane and finished willingly to be clearly second best. SASSY MELLY chased
the winner two wide in the clear, lacked a rally but churned on through the lane to save the show. JULIE BIRD (IRE) gave distant chase three wide and was
one-paced through the lane. SENORITA SALSA raced off the pace three wide, checked near the three-eighths pole and passed some faders in the lane.
IMPETUOSITY failed to menace while racing four wide. SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER was outrun inside. PORT EVE played no factor while racing two wide.
KENYA SUN was always far back and extremely wide. GALLETA saved ground and was never close.
