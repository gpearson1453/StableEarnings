CHITTO was well placed sitting just off the top trio, swung five wide for the drive, gathered momentum under steady pressure and edged away. LIMBO'S
PROMISE held a slim lead in early stages, dueled inside a duo at the quarter pole, battled on into the lane then got outkicked when the winner moved by.
HEAVY FAVOR pressed the pace in opening stages, dueled between rivals at the quarter pole, battled on with LIMBOS PROMISE in the lane then lacked
the closing response to prevail. QUANA DUDE raced off the early pace, swung six wide into the lane, shifted in a few paths and lacked the needed surge for
impact. SILVER AND ACES raced off the pace, went five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. ACTING SCRAPPY saved ground around the turn,
roused forward along the rail in the upper stretch then failed to sustain bid in the final furlong. SAILOR CHOW was forwardly placed in opening stages,
dueled for the lead at the quarter pole then weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
FANCY GI GI was allowed to settled in early stages and rated off the early pace, launched an outside bid late on the far turn, roused forward four wide in the
upper stretch, cleared on top under steady pressure and finished going away. ANIMATOR was unhurried and raced in the back, swung wide into the lane,
gathered momentum under right handed pressure, moved up into closer contention, took an awkward step at the eighth pole then ran on. LONGNTALL
settled through early stages, saved ground around the far turn, tipped out a path wider for the drive and prevailed for a share. JUSTATAPIN dueled for the
lead racing outside of JITTERS and raced well clear over the next pursuer through the backstretch, edged away on top at the quarter pole, got collared for
the lead in the upper stretch and gave way. STERN tracked the embattled duo, was ridden along three wide at the quarter pole and failed to move on.
JITTERS was a step slow then rushed up to engage JUSTATAPIN for the early lead, dueled with rival and raced well clear over the next pursuer through
the backstretch, could not match strides at the quarter pole then tired in the drive.

SIR ELI raced in contention and tracked the early leaders, made a two wide move near the quarter pole, roused forward to engage OUR LAST CHANCE for
the lead at the head of the lane, took command and finished well clear. FOR ME LET IT BE raced in pursuit around the turn, was ridden along three wide
into the lane and cleared second best. OUR LAST CHANCE set a pressured pace through early stages, got collared by the winner in the upper stretch and
weakened to show. HOOKED ON DREAMS chased the early pace, raced three wide at the quarter pole then flattened out in the lane. SWAMPDRAINER
lacked speed and saved ground to no avail. PRAIRIE WOLF raced in aim for the lead then came up empty at the quarter pole and dropped back.
