Footnotes
SEMINOLE JUSTICE chased the two rival duel through late turn, was asked for more nearing the quarter pole, made the lead while entering the lane from
the four path, cleared and was under strong handling to last. PROUD N FAMOUS was in the two or three path through the turn when never far back, bid
from the three path into the lane then steadily gained on the winner to the wire. COMPLEX JUSTICE pressed the pace two wide through the turn, was on
near even terms into the lane, could not go with the top two but kept on to save the show spot. SHADOW OF JUSTICE was never a serious factor while in
the two path through the turn. HE'S A WARRIOR was near the inside through the turn and never was a menace. TUFFER THAN TUFF set the pace down
the backstretch, dueled through the turn, gave way entering the lane then was eased the final eighth and walked off.

Footnotes
ROOSTER chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the five path, gained the lead approaching the sixteenth pole then
held on. WING AND WHEEL was in the three to the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the six path, took aim on the leader and was closing
in to the wire but ran out of real estate. BORDINI was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, began gaining momentum into the lane from the three
path, shifted into the two path inside the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. GAWKIER set the pace into the lane then yielded to the winner just inside the
eighth pole. CJ'S BILLY'SEMPIRE was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from off the inside and finished evenly. IMPROVISER was in the
three or four path through the turn, asked after mid-turn then tired through the lane. ARTEGON chased the pace along the inside into the far turn then
steadily faded.

Footnotes
TIP UP TOWN was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path with momentum, caught the leader approaching
the sixteenth pole and edged clear. RED LIAISON pressed the pace two wide into the turn, gained the lead in late turn, cleared into the lane then could not
hold the winner safe while clear for the place spot. EVEN MONEY saved ground through the turn when never far back, bid into the lane from the three path
and offered a mild gain. GO RODNEY raced in the three path through the turn, was in the four path with aim on the top ones after straightening in the lane
then finished evenly. PUNCTUATION was along the inside into the lane and never was a threat while improving position. TIZSUCCESS in the three path
through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and never was a factor while finishing widest. BIG EARL was slow early while in the two path
through the turn then showed some late interest when well back. RACE FOR THE PLACE set the pace while under pressure into the turn, vied through
mid-turn then was done along the rail.

Footnotes
RICH KINGDOM trailed early while just off the inside, came off the rail approaching mid-turn, gained momentum through the turn, entered the lane from the
five path, steadily gained on the leaders and inched up late. AZZARO STEEL chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from
the four path, dueled with another to nearing the sixteenth pole, gained the lead then could not hold the winner safer while clear for the place spot. FIVE
STAR COLONEL tracked the pace while along the inside into the lane, had an open rail through the final eighth but lacked the needed finishing response.
VICE COP set the pace while under pressure, cleared into the lane, dueled with the runner-up through mid-stretch and could not keep up. DAAHER
STREET was in the two or four path through the turn and offered a mild gain. BABY VINCENT pressed the pace two wide into the lane then faded. FLYING
SAMURAI was in the four to the three path through the turn and was done early. GUNFIGHTERJUSTICE was done early along the inside.

Footnotes
EVIL EYE vied for the lead into the first turn, gained the top spot on the backstretch, cleared soon after, continued to be clear through the turn and into the
lane then held while being kept to the task. MARV'S MAGIC settled off the pace while near the rail early, moved through the three or four path in late turn,
came into the lane from the four path with momentum then ran down a rival for place while not a threat to the winner. SCARLET CITY chased the pace from
the three path through the turn, came into the lane with aim on the leader then could not close on that one while losing the place spot late. COMFORT ME
NOW trailed through the turns while along the inside, came off the rail into the lane and gained belatedly. MR. GARY D raced in the three or four path
through the turn, swung into the lane from the five path, looked to be a threat once straightened then flattened. TILL THEN was unhurried while in the two to
the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and finished evenly while not a threat. BETTER WATCH OUT led into the turn, pressed
the pace through the far turn and was empty turning into the lane. NOD TO PERSIA chased the pace along the inside through the turns then faded through
the lane.

KISSES SO SWEET dueled outside of a rival while racing in the three path, then drew off in the stretch under mild urging. Z ZS RED dueled inside of the
winner but was no match in the drive. NO TRUST was off a step slow, raced in the three path, was six wide circling horses at the quarter pole, shifted to the
rail at the eighth pole to avoid traffic, then couldn't close late. MYGALJUSTICE pressed the pace in the three path, then drifted out slightly at the eighth pole
while giving way. NO MORE FAKE NEWS pressed inside before giving way in the stretch. CLIMBER raced in the two path before fading in the stretch.
