POLITICAL LOOPHOLE tracked lone leader along the rail on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn and into the stretch, dueled with rival
when leader tired, and prevailed late. HE BE DANGEROUS tracked leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and into the stretch,
dueled with POLITICAL LOOPHOLE in the stretch and came up a clear second best. MARKSMAN ON TARGET stalked leaders four wide on the
backstretch, continued well off the rail on the turn, entered stretch in the five path and belatedly rallied up for third. BANDSLAMMER came in and bothered
rivals at the start, quickly recovered and cleared easily on the backstretch, continued winging it up front on the turn and started to shorten stride in upper
stretch, and just edged out for the show photo by a wide rallying rival. FLAGS WEST bothered by outside rival at the start, lugged out approaching the three
eighths pole, tracked leaders three wide on the turn and came up one paced in the stretch. CRIDGE bumped both sides at the start, had to settled five wide
on the backstretch, altered in to avoid going five wide on the turn, lacked rally when asked in the stretch.
