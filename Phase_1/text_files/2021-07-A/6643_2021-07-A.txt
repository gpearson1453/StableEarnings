Footnotes
HOODOO BROWN stalked the early pace from a two path stance around the first turn, was roused at conclusion of backstretch and angled out to three
wide at upper stretch, then finished under a stiff drive in final furlong to secure the victory. SWAGATTACK loomed boldly along the inside in the second flight
for the opening half, rated three wide at upper stretch and rallied in final furlong to earn the place. MIGHTY BUGSY hustled from outset to exchange the
early command with MINER HEAT while saving ground around the first bend, rated as the inner most of three abreast at upper stretch, but failed to fend off
the top pair in closing strides and had to share the show with. MINER HEAT , who was hustled early and led the field from a two path pose through the
opening half, was between rivals at upper stretch and finished willingly to save the show. GOSPEL IKE failed to menace while trailing the field throughout.

MAGIC CARPET hustled away at the break, established a ground saving stance and assumed immediate command then led every step of the way for a
gate to wire score. TEXAS GOLD RUSH settled into the second flight and trekked the two path through the opening half before earning the place with strong
closing strides. OBSTRUCTED VIEW pressed the pace from a two path pose around the first bend, rated close up near the quarter pole, but flattened in the
final furlong. JUST BUBBA lacked a needed rally after giving chase from a ground saving stance. GRUFFANDTOUGH travelled three wide throughout and
faded in the late going.

Footnotes
SALLY G rushed from outset and assumed first command, saved ground and opened up a comfortable margin nearing the three quarter pole, led the field
along the backstretch, was challenged nearing the quarter pole, then responded to urging and refused to be headed in final eighth to secure the gate to wire
score for the second win a row. PEARLY broke alertly and established a two path stance, led the second flight through the opening half before closing the
gap on the pacesetter nearing the quarter pole, but was unable to run down the leader and eventual winner in closing strides. LILLY BELLE loomed along
the inside in the early going, came under rousing near the conclusion of the backstretch, rated three wide at upper stretch and rallied mildly to earn the
show. HUSHED settled into mid pack and gave chase around the second of three bends from a inside stance, angled out to the two path in the final turn but
came up empty in the crucial stages. TOMEY'S LEXUS trailed the field around the opening two bends while traveling widest of all, advanced along the
backstretch with a mid move, but faltered in the final quarter. JOLLYVILLE was unhurried and travelled wide through the opening half before fading in the
late going.

TIZ A SIGHT settled behind the early pacesetter and trekked the two path patiently around the first turn, closed the gap on the front runner through the final
bend, and wore down that rival in final furlong for the score. FIRST AT THE SCENE settled into second flight and gave chase from between rivals, angled
out to three wide at upper stretch and rallied to earn the place. GO HONEY GO rushed away from outset and established a comfortable margin on the field
around the first bend and along the backstretch, but failed to sustain the bid and was overtaken in closing strides. BAYANI COUNTY hustled in opening
strides to assume a ground saving stance, led the second flight into the opening bend, and weakened in the late going. ADCATS RIDE failed to threaten
while rating back and traveling three wide early. TAPPIN FOR TROUBLE trailed from outset.

Footnotes
SI ES GOYA hurried away from outset and disputed the early pace from a two path stance, loomed on the outside of the pacesetter through the opening
half, gained command nearing the quarter pole and outlasted that rival in closing strides for the score. RONALD DALE rushed from outset and set the pace
from an inside stance for the opening half, was headed nearing the quarter pole, but failed to match strides with that rival in the final furlong and was forced
to settle for the place. WILLY SPECIAL CATS swung to the three path at upper stretch and rallied to earn the show after trailing the field through the first
half of contest. STACCATO settled into mid pack and gave chase to frontrunners while saving ground but lacked a needed rally in late going to contend in
the end. MAJOR BROWN rated mid pack through the opening half and was three wide at the half pole, closed the gap on leaders along the backstretch,
was trekking the two path at upper stretch and weakened in final eighth. THE GREATEST EAGLE failed to threaten while giving chase from a wide stance
and tiring in the late stages. ZYPTO stalked the front runners from a two path pose in the early stages before being eased near the quarter pole.

BE A LOVELY DAY hustled from outset to assume first command and led every step of the way while saving ground for a gate to wire score. DAISY
FIFTYSEVEN rushed along the backstretch to lead the second flight into the bend, trekked the two path around the turn, but proved no match for the winner.
LUCKILY tucked behind early front runners to save ground around the turn and finished with a rush to be gaining on the leaders and earning the show.
BIZZAR BROWN travelled along the three path, was three wide at upper stretch and finished evenly. SHES THE BEAST gave chase from between rivals,
lacked a response to urging, and weakened in the final furlong. FUN FACTS rated mid pack at the conclusion of backstretch, angled out at upper stretch to
advance, but to no avail. TERRIS STRONG HOPE failed to menace while trailing the field from outset.

COVINGTON QUALITY rushed from outset to share the early command from a two path pose, shook off rivals nearing the quarter pole and drew off in final
eighth for a clear score. BURTNJOE stalked the early pacesetter three wide through the first turn, advanced on the front runner along the backstretch,
trekked the two path around the closing bend and into upper stretch and proved to be second best in the end. COUNT N GOLD settled in between rivals
and rated in the second flight into the opening turn, advanced position along the backstretch by angling out near the five sixteenths pole, then came up
empty in the homestretch. SPECTACTICAL flashed early foot and set the early pace from a ground saving stance before fading in the late going. ONE SON
OF A CHIEF was unhurried in the early stages, swung wide at upper stretch and failed to menace.

GINNY'S SONG sped away to assume first command and establish a ground saving stance, led every step of the way, and was widening the margin at the
finish. DOWNEASTER ALEXA broke alertly, chased the speedy pacesetter along the backstretch while leading the second flight, trekekd the inside around
the bend, and proved second best. TIAGO'S SONG rated close up along the backstretch, travelled the three path around the turn, was three wide at upper
stretch but needed more rally in the final furlong. FLASHY LOOK improved placing with late interest after traveling wide through the turn. KASHMERE PLAY
tucked behind early front runners to save ground through the bend and lacked a needed rally. S S SUPER SPORT was unhurried and rated mid pack in the
early going, gave chase from between rivals and tired in the late stages. DIRTY DANCER trailed from outset.

SEXY RAGS rushed from outset and established an inside stance, led the field at first call, was headed along the backstretch, then came again and kicked
clear in the closing strides for the victory. ORPHAN ANGIE settled into the two path and behind the early front runners through the opening half before
weaving rivals at upper stretch while rallying with strong late strides to earn the place honors. META LADY was hurried from outset and shared the early
pace as the outer rival of two abreast through the opening bend, rated two wide at upper stretch but was outfinished by top pair in final eighth. PRAIRIE
STAR showed reserve and gave chase from second flight in the early going while travelling widest of all, maintained that wide route through the closing turn
and lost ground to front runners by doing so. SWIFT JUSTICE lacked a needed rally after giving chase from between rivals. NOTABLY GOOD failed to
threaten from a trailing and ground saving stance.

NAUTICAL MOON established a two path stance alongside the early pacesetter shortly after the start, gained command midway down the backstretch, then
ran away from all rivals in the closing quarter of a mile for a clear victory. CANDY BARON showed reserve in the opening half and trailed the field through
the opening turn, angled out nearing the quarter pole, circled rivals through the closing bend to be widest of all at upper stretch, and rallied in the middle of
the homestretch to earn the place. NOMOREMRNICEGUY settled into mid pack and trekked three wide through both turns then finished willingly to save the
show. NOTORIOUS L. I. A. finished evenly after rating along the inside and in the second flight. ZIONITE flashed early speed and led the field at first call
before eclipsing in the crucial stages of contest. BUD MINISTER tucked to the inside and saved ground while trailing the field.

FINAL BURBANK showed reserve in the opening half while saving ground, was given the cue nearing the quarter pole, angled out at conclusion of
backstretch, gained command through the closing turn and inched clear in final furlong. FALLSTAR hustled early to press the pace from a two path stance,
gained command midway, led the field at the quarter pole, but failed to fend off the late charge of eventual winner in the late going. BIG GAME HUNTER
was unhurried for the opening half, swung wide through the closing bend and rallied strongly to earn the show and just miss the place. ROSIE'S CITY BOY
settled into mid pack, trekked the two path through the opening half, was the inner most rival at upper stretch and lacked a late rally to improve placing.
MAYFAIR HEIGHTS gave chase to the early front runners from a two path stance and faded in the closing half of contest. WENT retreated rapidly after
flashing early foot.

SEEING DOUBLE was unhurried into and through the first turn, trailing the field through the first call, then was given the cue along the backstretch,
responded accordingly and circled all rivals to lead the field at upper stretch and secure a last-to-first victory. SHEMINE FELINE rushed from outset to lead
the field through the opening half from a ground saving stance, bt could not fend off the rally of eventual winner in the closing stages. SAVE THE DAY was
unhurried in the early stages and trekked the two path through the bends before rallying mildly to earn the show. MARKANTONY'SQUEEN settled into a
three wide pose and rated in the second flight around the first turn, closed the gap on the front runner nearing the quarter pole, was between rivals at upper
stretch and finished evenly. FLAT QUICK established a ground saving position shortly after the start, was close up in the second flight along the backstretch
and tired in the late going. GOSPEL TIZ JOY flashed some early speed and pressed the early pace through the first call pole before retreating in the latter
half. TWILIGHT GLOW traveled wide and was no threat.
