UNO TIGRESS set a pressured pace in the three path, then was headed on the turn nearing the quarter pole, but made a bid to draw clear passed the
furlong marker, then remained clear to prove best, ridden out. SUSIKIN pressed the winner and made a four wide bid on the turn but proved to be no match
for that rival while clearly second best. TUESDAY'S ROSE was reserved early and made a mild move while wide on the turn, then came very wide into the
drive and offered a mild late rally to best the rest. CHIT CHAT GIRL was settled back early on the inside, swung out three wide for the drive and had a
belated rally. VICTORY TIME was allowed to settle early and made a mild four wide bid on the turn but was empty in the stretch. MARY COSTA threw head
and was bumped at the start, then was on the inside and had no response. THE BAY EXPRESS chased the early pace on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
DOWNTOWN KATIE was allowed to settle while three wide and in between rivals down the backstretch, then made a four wide move on the far turn, hit the
front leaving the quarter pole and drew off in the stretch to prove much the best while being ridden out. EPHEMERAL was rated along early, then eased out
and advanced three wide on the turn, came four wide into the drive and finished willingly but no match for the winner while clearly second best. VESPER
vied for the early lead towards the inside, then went on to set the pace on the backstretch, then was headed nearing the quarter pole and weakened, held
show award late. HUMMIN' THE FUNK was well placed early on the inside, then was shuffled back on the backstretch, then finished with interest on the
inside late to just miss the show award. HOME BY SEVEN was five wide on the first turn, then stalked the pace five wide and made a four wide bid on the
far turn, but came up empty in the drive. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL was allowed to settle while four wide and had no rally. MISS FRIESAN was bumped hard at
the start, then was void of early speed, passed the tiring rivals on the inside. WINNINGFORPLEASURE vied for the early lead four wide and in between
rivals on the turn, then weakened. PRIME COAT was not a threat. KATS IN CHARGE vied for the early lead three wide and in between rivals, then moved
over to the rail on the backstretch and tired. NOT SHY vied for the early lead five wide, then stalked the pace four wide and tired. REMARKABLE LASS was
bumped at the start, then raced five wide on the backstretch and stopped.

Footnotes
D'CRAZINESS was allowed to settle early, advanced on the turn, came six wide into the drive, then was roused when straightened and responded well to
closed well on the outside and edged away late. NATIONAL HONOR was rated along early towards the inside and two wide, then was blocked and had to
check by the quarter pole, then found room on the inside and closed well but was outfinished. HOT TO SEEK HER chased the early pace and made a mild
bid on the inside to be in contention by the quarter pole, tipped out three wide but needed more. JAG was reserved early, then was in traffic and in between
rivals leaving the turn, angled in leaving the furlong marker and had a late gain on the inside. GUNSLINGER (IRE) was keen early to set the pace while
clear, remained clear leaving the turn but weakened the final furlong. JEEZUM JIM chased the pace four wide and came into the drive five wide and faded.
THE QUANTICO KID lacked a rally. YEAR OF THE KITTEN failed to menace. LAWN BOY (GB) had no response while five wide. BOPPIN ANDA WEAVIN
stalked the pace three wide and tired. COBH was bumped at the start, no factor.

Footnotes
SEANOW was rated along three wide, then made a five wide move on the turn, then continued the move into the stretch and drew clear in the furlong
grounds to draw clear the final sixteenth under a drive. IN THE LOOP dueled for the early lead three wide and shook off that rival leaving the furlong
grounds but proved to be no match for the winner the final sixteenth while second best. WHERE PARADISE LAY dueled for the lead on the inside and
faded in the drive, stayed on for the show award. PIANZI was taken back early and had no early speed while four wide, continued to race far back and four
wide by the quarter pole, then closed full of run late passing a rival late and was in front on the gallop out before the clubhouse turn. RILEYS DUDE tracked
the early pace on the inside, then swung out six wide for the drive and was empty.
