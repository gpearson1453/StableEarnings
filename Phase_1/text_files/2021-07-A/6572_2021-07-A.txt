Footnotes
AVIE'S MESA raced in mid pack along the rail, closed three-wide on the far turn, the rider lost his whip at the top of the stretch but bid a furlong out and
prevailed under steady handling. I IDOLIZE YOU settled off the pace, closed late backstretch then circled three to five-wide on the far turn, challenged a
furlong out but was outkicked. AHEADBYACENTURY stalked the pace, bid three-wide early o the far turn, edged ahead and moved clear into the stretch,
was passed a furlong out and gave way grudgingly. RED BO settled off the early pace, closed late backstretch, chased two to four-wide on the turn, chased
into the stretch and finished gamely. HEYDON'S CASE raced three-wide in mid pack, closed four-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and flattened
out in the final furlong. GIANT MINE took command mid way of the clubhouse turn, set a pressured pace, was engaged at the far turn and gave way
approaching the stretch. GREENFIELD showed brief speed, was headed midway through the first turn, pressed the pace, bid along the rail into the far turn,
could not match strides and gave way approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
SWEET SYDNEY broke awkwardly, settled in mid pack, closed two to four-wide through the turn, led at the top of the stretch and widened under a hand
ride. PUT A HEMI IN HER was away slowly and allowed to dropped to the back of the pack, moved to the outside and began to close the gap, chased three
and four-wide on the turn and rallied in vain. BORN TO BE KING pressed the pace into the turn, moved from the rail to three-wide late turn, chased into the
stretch and chased to the end. GIZMO ROGERS close early, forced the pace late backstretch, bid into the turn, dueled, was headed at the top of the stretch
and retreated. GLITTER MOUNTAIN set a pressured pace in hand, dueled on the turn, was headed by a third rival at the top of the stretch and faded.
CARDIFF HALL raced from off the pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn, was steadied behind rivals approaching the stretch then failed to menace. P
S CHARLIE BROWN raced in mid pack, chased hard two and three-wide on the turn but flattened out in the stretch. ONE THOU briefly forced the issue
then backed up although under a ride on the turn and continued to retreat in the stretch.

Footnotes
JILLI MARIE took back early, maneuvered by her rider over to the rail into the turn, got a dream run up the fence and continued her rail hugging trip inside
the pacesetter by the sixteenth pole, winning the head bobbing finish with a desperate final lunge. IMA BEAST cleared inside a rival soon after the start,
held the front gamely until inside the sixteenth pole, seemed to lose the lead inside the sixteenth pole but battled back under strong left handed urging while
drifting out to lose a tight head bobbing finish. HELLO FRIENDS was three wide chasing in mid pack, came three to four wide to loom up outside the leaders
turning for home, fanned into the five path in upper stretch after dropping back somewhat but re-rallied in the final furlong and was inching up at the finish.
TEACHER'S PET off the pace early, came up along the rail following the winner's path on the turn, seemed to stall in upper stretch but found another gear
in the final sixteenth, closing big ground from there to the wire. TAKOTA won the break but was taken back by the rider and allowed the eventual place
finisher to take the lead, stalked that one to the quarter but was floated out into the four path turning for home and stalled. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD chased
along the inside, came out midway on the turn to take on the leader and looked a menace but couldn't sustain her bid and tired down the lane. SILVER
DAHLIA trailed quickly, was four wide at the back around the turn and never in contention.

Footnotes
DADDYPLAYSTHEBLUES raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn, gained steadily through the stretch and was up late under a
drive. SAMUEL H broke outward but gained a short advantage, set a pressured pace, drew clear at the head of the stretch but was caught nearing the wire.
I HAVE HOPE forced the early pace from the rail, dueled on the backstretch then hustled through the far turn and chased through the stretch but could not
close the gap. STRONG ATTITUDE was pinched back just out of the gate, stalked the pace, chased two-wide on the far turn and was all out in the stretch.
BIG BOY BENNY broke outward and settled off the pace, circled three to five-wide late on the far turn but evened out in the late stages. LETTING LOOSE
ducked in at the outset and settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn then finished evenly. NO EXIT raced in mid pack along the rail,
closed late on the far turn but never reached contention. CELTIC CHIEF pressed the pacesetter three-wide on the clubhouse turn, dropped back four-wide
on the final turn and lacked a rally. POUROSO raced in mid pack on the fence, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the far turn then flattened out in
the final furlong. HIT THIS TOWN broke slowly and raced from off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response.
