Footnotes
AMANI'S KITTEN good position off rail first turn, rallied with late kick in time. KITCHI inside speed to the stretch grudgingly in the late going missed.
ZACAPA RUN restrained to far turn inside, rallied outside too late, nipped. SEA ADMIRAL ran up to vie on the lead to far turn, forged a short lead, empty.
GRAY HOPE stumbled at the start, lost best chance, loped along mildly late. YEAHIKNOW lunged at the start, raced back to the far turn, ran on too late.
CHA VEZ inside position throughout with no excuse. KNIGHT ERRANT never factored

late. MAMBACITA good position early, chased winner to deep stretch, missed place. SUPERVISE no speed to far turn, rallied to move up a bit in the
stretch. LOLAS CREED chased off rail to the half, gave way from that point and faded. MISS O' PRADO never menaced. PERK THE GENTS UP shuffled
back at the start and always outrun.
