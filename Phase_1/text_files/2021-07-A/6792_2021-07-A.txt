Footnotes
PIONEER PRIDE broke inward but alertly, took immediate command, clear through the turn, extended that advantage a bit past the furlong marker, steady
handling from there to the wire to last. LEYTON'S HIPPIE also broke to the inside but with the winner resulting in POINT TO THE GREEN to be put in tight,
chased off the inside up the backstretch and through the turn, fell back a bit when straightened for home, roused, closing the gap late in finishing up
willingly. BUBBA SMACK broke back, lacked early foot, moved off the inside, came four wide into the lane, displayed some belated interest down the middle
of the strip to be in time for the show. KANNON WITH A K fidgety prior to the start, broke with the leaders, brushed, raced within striking distance just off the
inside, came up empty for the stretch run, nipped late for the show. SASSY'S PROSPECTOR went evenly in lacking a closing response while three wide
most of the way. POINT TO THE GREEN in tight then steadied to be shuffled back at the break, trailed, came five wide out of the turn, failed to muster a
closing response.

Footnotes
DESTINY WAY broke alertly, set all the pace toward the inside, drew out through the lane under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. SIR POKERFACE
void of speed for a half, rallied through traffic to be up for the place, no match for the winner. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT chased the winner in vain throughout,
also proved no match in the drive, caught late for the place. OPTIMISTIC settled off the pace, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response.
PAY THE DREAM raced in mid pack for four furlongs just off the rail, had little for the drive. HOMELAND MESSA was never a factor.

GOLD PUNCH stalked the early leader off the inside, took over at will midway on the turn, clear into the lane, increased advantage under steady handling.
SIGN OF WAR broke on top, clear in the run up the backstretch, offered no resistance to the winner when confronted by that one after three furlongs, far
clear of the rest. CONQUISTADOR GOLD last away, trailed most of the way, up late for the third spot while remaining inside, no threat to the top pair.
LOUISIANA THUNDER raced outside, had nothing for the drive, caught late for the third spot.

Footnotes
OUTOFTHISGALAXY broke sharp, got clear the opening quarter, rated while maintaining a daylight advantage up the backstretch through some soft
opening fractions, not threatened in the drive under firm handling. EASTSIDE BOY unhurried early, continued in hand in the run up the backstretch, asked
along far turn, got through along the inside turning for home, long duel for the place, game for that position, no threat to the winner. SUCH settled off the
pace and the inside, came four wide out of the final turn, drifted slightly when dueling for the runner up position, outkicked, well clear of the others.
INVASORS WIND broke in mid pack, went one paced throughout in failing to rally. SILENT FORCE in mid pack outside, four wide first turn, continued
outside, four out to five wide in the second turn, lacked a serious closing response. ZING ZANG chased the winner early, gave way after a half. TEN
SILVER PINS last away, trailed far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
PLATINUM QUEEN broke back, was used to advanced four wide through the early part of the turn to join the leader, alternated outside that one in the run
up the backstretch, disposed of the other speed by late in the final turn, shook clear midstretch, enough left to hold the runner up at bay late. GRAND ISLE
GIRL in the second flight off the inside early, moved closer under a right handed crop turning for home, fell back off the winner past the furlong marker,
coming again to finish up willingly. EXPLOSIVELY HOT in the second group the opening half toward but not on the rail, crept a bit slower while between
horses turning for home, finished up best of the rest while not a serious threat to the wire at the wire. GATOR PROUD raced well back off the early pace,
three wide most of the way, lacked the needed serious rally when called on for the drive. DEVIL WITH A DASH last to leave, raced five wide into the first
turn, remained back in failing to menace. SHE'S MY PRIORITY showed the way into the first turn along the inside, dueled with the winner before a half,
gave way in the final turn, continued to back up through the lane.

Footnotes
SAY YES AGAIN broke alertly, cleared to the inside into the first turn, showed the way under restraint through some soft fractions the middle part, stayed
clear in the drive while kept to pressure the final furlong. NINE LINE BIND bothered slightly when in a bit tight at the break, chased the winner throughout off
the inside, could do little with that one through the lane, remained clear for the place. ENVOY'S GUILT broke out, was straightened to race well back off the
pace, swung out to the five path to be widest for the drive, late run down the middle of the strip to be in time for the show. RUNNING ROSADO one paced
off the leaders and the inside, came four wide out of the final turn, finished up evenly in lacking a late punch, nipped for the show. TWO WITH A TEN
brushed at the start, raced just behind and outside the runner up in pursuit of the winner, weakened in the drive. DORI'S BIRDIES off slow, steadied to trail
early, continued to race sluggishly in the run up the backstretch, made little recovery through the lane to trail home.

Footnotes
SPECIAL CONNECTION off the early pace outside and four wide through the first turn, continued outside in the run up the backstretch, moved closer while
once again four wide in the far turn, took over in the three path into the lane, shook clear. SPELLBINDING broke through the gate prior to the start, broke
back, steadied inside of some traffic first turn, within striking distance, bit closer in some traffic late in the final bend, moved out a bit and finished up willingly
to earn the place. BLESSED ANNA forwardly placed while racing along the inside, continued to save ground into the far turn, shuffled back while in traffic
along the rail late in that bend, continued to lack clear room nearing the furlong grounds, split foes late to be up for the show. HEART THAT BINDS settled
off the pace, four wide into the lane when roused, lacked closing punch while improving position slightly. ISOLATION away in good order, clear in the first
turn when setting the pace, edged away to a longer advantage up the backstretch, briefly responded when confronted in the second turn when gave way
when headed. MISS NITAP closest to the leader, advanced on that one with the rest of the field second turn, challenged inside the winner, vied with that
one into the lane then faltered the final furlong. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
OKALANI lacked early foot, moved up steadily through the turn toward the inside, angled three wide when moving to challenge exiting the bend, kicked
clear under steady handling. BRAVE CITY GIRL away well, dueled up front along the inside, vied into the lane while closest to the inside of the first flight,
could not match the winner in the drive, proved determined for the second spot. POINT OF VICTORY away in good order, dueled up front outside the
runner up, vied between horses into the stretch, also proved no match for the winner, outkicked for the place. OAK HILL SENIORITA lacked speed, angled
out to be five wide exiting the turn, improved position, no threat to the top three. KASEN'S SISTER void of speed, in some traffic when a moving a bit closer
along the inside late in the turn, improved slightly when clear for the drive. CYBER SNEAKER in mid pack while racing off the inside, four wide into the lane,
made little impact in the run to the wire. PRAYERS SAVED last away, improved up the main body before a furlong, tired in the drive. MY AVANI broke back,
void of speed when falling far back, picked off a couple of faltering rivals while never a factor. RICH DREAMS broke alertly, pressed the two leaders after a
quarter, gave way in the drive. DOUBLE APPEAL within striking distance early, stopped in the turn, jogged in.
