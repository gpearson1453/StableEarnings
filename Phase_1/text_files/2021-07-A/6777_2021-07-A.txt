Footnotes
MYERS TIGER was quickly clear soon after the start, raced on a comfortable lead down the backstretch and into the lane, was shaken up straightening in
the lane then ridden out to inside the sixteenth pole and geared down late. AZILOOK chased the winner throughout while in the two path, was under a drive
into the lane but could not make up ground and settled for second best. BOLD CONCEPT was well back while saving ground, was asked for more near
mid-turn when coming off the rail, came into the lane from the six path and moved up while not a threat. ELLE'S CROWN was never a threat while along the
inside through the far turn. ENTRUSTED unhurried into the far turn, was asked for more through the turn while racing in the three or four path, continued in
the four path into the lane and tired. CHARM OF THE CITY was in the three to the two path through the turns and was empty entering the lane. The
three-quarter and seven-eighths times were omitted due to timer malfunction.

FLOWERPECKER set the pace from the two path on a clear lead, continued to widened the advantage into the lane and had his largest advantage at the
wire. POLAR WIND was unhurried while in the two path into the turn, angled off the rail through late turn, was in the four path into the lane, quickly moved
past the chasing rivals after straightening then could only chase the winner home while clear for the place spot. BANDIDO DE AMORES trailed while along
the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, shifted to the five path and moved up. YANKEE SEVEN chased the winner from the
three path into late turn, was closest to that one into the lane and tired. SECRETARY AT WAR saved ground through the turn and into the lane, cut the
corner and appeared a contender then weakened. MYSTERY MAN chased the winner from the four path into the turn, continued well off the rail into the

Footnotes
TRUCKIN' ON vied for the lead along the inside into the turn, put his head in front in late turn, cleared after straightening in the lane then widened to end.
JENNSTONE chased the two rival duel through the turn while in the two path, angled into the three or four path for the drive and steadily inched up on the
place rival, gained that spot and barely held it at the wire. ALTERNATE NIGHTS was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, came into the lane
from the three or four path, shifted back into the two path near the eighth pole and finished with much better energy that others to just miss the place spot.
KINGOFTHERAINBOW vied for the lead two wide through the turn, lost ground to the winner after straightening in the lane and slowly lost ground the last
sixteenth. FORENSIC FILE was in the three path through the turn when never far back, angled into the four or five path for the drive, appeared to be a
contender once straightened then lacked a closing response. ASTROMAN lacked a response when being asked after mid-turn while saving ground.

Footnotes
FIRST KITTEN veered in at the start, bothering foes, stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the three-eighths pole, vied in the stretch and was clear late,
lasting under all out urging. WILD TAPIT took up at the start, losing four lengths, rallied on the turn, angled six wide in early stretch, rallied and just missed
at the wire. ADMIRAL'S GARNET dueled outside of a foe, then inside through the stretch and yielded late. POLYESTER BRIDE was bumped at the start,
stalked in the three path, then had a mild late bid. MOCHA passed tired rivals. GOODBYE GREELEY dueled inside to the stretch and gave way. WARIS
saved ground to the turn and faded. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE JOCKEY OF WILD TAPIT, FIRST KITTEN WAS
DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE START.
