BAYERN'S MIRAGE chased the early pace three wide and closed three wide in the drive to edged clear late under a drive. KIND OF GALLANT was away
alertly and soon clear to set the early pace on the inside, then maintained that big lead nearing the furlong marker but faltered while saving the place.
PLUTONIUM was allowed to settle early on the inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well late between horses. TIZTRUCULENT was allowed to settle
while four wide and had a mild late rally but needed more. PROUD NATION chased the early pace on the inside then angled off the rail passed the three
sixteenths pole but had no kick. TRAIL DRIVER was reserved while three wide and angled out in the stretch and showed some late interest.

MORO WARRIOR dueled for the lead and made a three wide bid leaving the turn and prevailed after a long drive. PAPA MOLLY dueled for the lead on the
inside and dug in gamely in the stretch but was outfinished. MORO MERICA stalked the pace four wide but lacked the needed stretch bit while gaining the
show award late. VICKSLINCOLNLAWYER dueled for the lead in between rivals and faded in the drive losing the show award late. CMON HANK checked
after the start, then showed little. AUTHENTIC ARCH was not a factor while wide.

STILLCHARGINGMARIA was bumped at the start, then went on to set the pace on the inside while being well handled, drew clear leaving the turn and was
given a few right handed reminders to remain clear. NEEDS NO ALIBI was allowed to settle early, then advanced five wide on the turn and finished willingly
to be second best. WAPI was reserved early, made a four wide move on the far turn but flattened out. GURKHA GOLD (IRE) was rated along the inside and
made a rail bid entering the stretch but flattened out late. DUCHESS BUBBLES was allowed to settle early three wide, then was two wide by the quarter
pole but had no rally. DEES LOCA MOTION tracked the winner and made a mild bid three wide and weakened. PRESCIENT failed to menace. MALIBU

WHAT'S NEWS vied for the early lead three wide, then made a bid on the turn to shake clear passed the quarter pole, then held sway late to prove best
under a drive. POQUITOMAS was well placed early on the inside, eased out to make a four wide bid passed the quarter pole, continued that bid to close
well in the stretch but was too late. AIDANIKE vied for the lead on the inside and faded while besting the rest. INDY LOVER chased the early pace and was
three wide passed the quarter pole and offered a mild late rally. PURE SILK was shut off and checked hard at the start, then raced on the inside on the turn
and was no threat. TEXAS TIDELANDS broke outwardly at the start, settled on the inside and tired. SIGNE was allowed to settle while three to four wide
and stopped.
