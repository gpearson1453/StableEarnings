Footnotes
OLD SOT unhurried in the early going while off the inside, began to move closer just before a half, came three wide into the lane, drifted in with less than a
furlong remaining, was straightened and finished with determination to be up in time. LEROY JENKINS also lacked any early foot, continued back into the
far turn, came widest for the drive, in time for the pace while carving into the winner's margin at the end. SMOKY TOPAZ broke alertly, dueled up front off
the inside, shook off the other speed to be clear when straightened for home, lugged into the gap with a sixteenth to run and faltered to be caught by the top
two late. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN settled off the pace and the inside, three wide into the lane, lacked a rally when set down for the drive. SUN STRIKER
hustled away from the gate to maintain frontal inside position, dueled the middle half while remaining closest to the inside, weakened in the drive.
DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY washy in the post parade, broke with the field, bore out into the first turn, stopped before a half, distanced after losing contact with
the field, walked off. R T'S DUDE settled in mid pack, appeared to bobble exiting the final turn, pulled up in distress immediately afterward, vanned off.
FRACTIONAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
ASTRO FLASH tracked pace along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, angled out three wide turning for home, could do little with the
winner in the final furlong, well clear for the place. LES AND MADGE broke slowly, continued back in failing to menace. REBECCA G broke out sharply to
bother a slow breaking IRONIT, was quickly straightened, alternated up front inside the winner, could not match that one through upper stretch, continued to
weaken the final furlong while managing to saved the show. IRONIT off slow then was bothered to begin flat footed and well back, far back into the turn,
never dangerous. FREE LIKE A GIRL broke well, dueled up front in the two path, disposed of the other speed in upper stretch, drew out through the lane
under a steady right handed crop.

SPECTROLITE broke alertly, soon sprinted clear, rated while maintaining daylight through the turn, stayed clear through the stretch while being kept to task
with a right handed crop to the wire. HOORAY AUSTIN forwardly placed from the start, chased the winner into the stretch, roused, slowly getting to that one
late, well clear of the rest. BEST YOU EVER SEEN void of speed off the inside, three path into the lane, staged a belated rally to be up for the show late,
not a threat to the top pair. GIANT MESA in mid pack, moved outside, came four wide into the lane, even finish, not enough for the show. SONOMA CRUSH
last away, raced off the pace inside, continued to save ground through the turn, lacked a closing response. BROADWAY JONES remained always back. I'M
LOOKING UP chased the winner early, began a steady retreat before three furlongs.

STARBUCK LUCK broke alertly, dueled up front in the two path, shook off the other speed turning for home, briefly clear past the furlong marker, responded
when MARIPOSA D'ORO challenged soon after, drifted out a bit late under a left handed crop with a sixteenth to run brushing that rival, then continued to
game fashion to dig in at the wire and refuse to be denied. MARIPOSA D'ORO forwardly placed while racing outside, came three wide out of the turn,
brushed late by STARBUCK LUCK to be moved out a full path, outkicked at the wire to be denied. FOURSWEETNIECES void of speed in trailing for three
furlongs, improved up the rail to be slowly getting to the top two late. EZEE ENOUGH last away, four wide late in the turn when off the pace, lacked a
response in the drive to trail home. FIRSTSLATE away in good order, dueled up front along the inside for three furlongs, faltered in the drive. FOLLOWING
A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF MARIPOSA D'ORO AGAINST STARBUCK LUCK FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
SUM NATION allowed the pace to go early, continued to race behind the pace backstretch, made a strong and sudden acceleration to take over midway on
the final turn, quickly well clear, continued to draw away to win ridden out. FIRST LADY OF SONG broke out, was straightened and showed the way into the
first turn inside, relinquished the advantage and chased that leader the middle half, moved closer just before being overtaken by the winner far turn, proved
no match for that one thereafter, narrowly saved the place. BEE HOUSE broke out badly into the first turn carrying J Z'S FIRST out wide, settled in the run
up the backstretch, came four wide out of the second turn, improved upper stretch, slowly gaining for the second spot late. J Z'S FIRST last to leave, carried
wide by BEE HOUSE into the first turn, continued to be bothered by that one past the half way point of that bend, lacked speed in trailing up the backstretch,
improved position with some late interest while widest in the drive. AMIRITE settled off the pace, lacked a closing response. VELLEITY was used a bit to
clear up front late in the first turn, showed the way the middle half then gave way when headed by the winner in the second turn. CIRCLEOFCOLOR
forwardly placed for a half, gave way. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN INTO THE FIRST TURN AND CLAIM OF FOUL BY
THE RIDER OF J Z'S FIRST AGAINST BEE HOUSE FOR INTERFERENCE AT THAT SAME JUNCTURE OF THE RACE, BEE HOUSE WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH.

Footnotes
BLAZING FIRE took command up the rail soon after the start, shook clear turning for home, not threatened in the run to the wire, geared down late to win
ridden out. PERFECT PERIGEE in the second flight off the inside, three wide turning for home, no match for the winner late, clearly second best. CAJUN
NAVY lacked early foot, crept a bit closer late in the turn, came four wide into the stretch, finished up best of the rest. FIRST METAL COUNT broke alertly,
early lead, relinquished advantage, pressed, began a steady after three furlongs. COAST GUARDSMAN tracked the early pace inside, within striking
distance early in the turn, steadied when in tight along the rail turning for home, fell back and came up empty for the stretch run. BETTIN ON BRYAN trailed
throughout in showing little.

JAYS RIVERWRANGLER took control out of the chute, well clear in the run into the turn, continued to hold a comfortable margin into the stretch, failed to
contain the winner in the late going, well clear of the others. THIRSTY WIND popped stall doors prestart, broke slowly, raced back, traffic late in the turn,
steered widest for the drive, steered out widest for room, finished up willingly to annex the third spot. PORQUE SI lacked speed for a half, improved while
angling out exiting the turn, flattened out late to be outfinished for the show. MARVINS GOLD within striking distance for a half while racing outside, came
up empty for the stretch run. MARKS SAINT broke out to bother IDE LIKE HAWAII, was straightened to race in mid pack, weakened in the drive. IDE LIKE

Footnotes
THREE RUN HOMER moved up to contest the pace into the first turn, dueled then edged away a bit after a half, second duel into far turn, shook clear into
the lane, held sway late under steady handling. BAYOU JAM last away, tucked in to save some ground first turn, continued back, three wide when
beginning to advance late in the final turn,steadily closed ground on the winner while running out of track late. BEAUREGARD dueled up front closest to the
inside, fell back after a half, briefly rejoined the leader into the far turn then could not keep up in the drive nor contain the runner up, far clear of the others.
WHISKEY'S GONE in the second flight early toward the inside, continued to track the leaders up the backstretch, came up empty for the drive.
COMMANDER SCOTT five wide then angled in a bit entering the first turn, raced in the second group off the inside the middle half mile then began to tire.
TOO MUCH BOURBON in tight then steadied into the first turn, never close in remaining back.

Footnotes
DEBBIES PASSAGE broke back, began a steady advance into contention while four wide into the turn, took over entering the stretch,drew steadily clear
under continued pressure. SARAH ADRIANA broke out, quickly straightened to race with the early pace off the inside, briefly garnered a larger advantage
midway on the turn, offered little resistance to the winner entering the stretch, no match, clearly second best. LOT'SA SILVER broke back, lacked speed,
advanced four wide out of the turn, lugged in past the furlong marker, no match top two. LIGHT AS A WHISPER back off the early pace, came three wide
out of the turn, bothered slightly by a lugging LOT'SA SILVER past the furlong marker, finished up evenly. PHANTOM POINT broke alertly, flashed brief
speed along the inside, faded before three furlongs. MADI STRONG broke slowly, trailed most of the way, passed tiring rivals while never a threat. HONOR
AND RESPECT with the early pace while between rivals, began to weaken. KIM'S PARRAIN behind the early leaders inside, shuffled back along the rail
into the turn, continued to fade through the lane.
