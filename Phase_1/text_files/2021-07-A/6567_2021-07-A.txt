Footnotes
IYWAAN , between rivals past the seven furlong marker, prompted two to three wide under confident handling through the backstretch run, moved to attack
leaving the far turn, dueled under asking past the five sixteenths and into the lane, secured command leaving the three sixteenths, kicked clear under left
handed asking with a furlong remaining then steadily widened under a solid hand ride. CAPE LOOKOUT broke a step slow, recovered and moved three
wide to a clear lead nearing the backstretch, set a rated pace towards the inside, dug in when collared near the three eighths, sparred inside the winner into
the lane, proved no match in the final furlong but stayed willingly enough the hold down the place. GIO DUDE , three wide stalking the pace, shifted four
wide under a ride into the lane, chased and came up empty. HASHTAG WINNING stalked inside, dropped back under a ride past the five sixteenths but
lacked a solid finish. ALWAYS FORGIVEN , three wide off the pace, failed to menace. CAMPARI was outrun.

Footnotes
R B'S STAR , a bit off the rail disputing the pace inside SIX O'CLOCK SARAH for a half mile, opened a clear lead approaching the eighth pole while still off
the rail and held sway under steady handling. THUNDER BOSS came in leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four deep, rallied and drifted in near the
sixteenth pole. SIX O'CLOCK SARAH disputed the pace outside the winner and finished willingly. STILL DOING TIME bore in leaving the starting gate,
saved ground on the turn, remained along the inner rail in the stretch and flattened out. PETITION PRAYER broke sluggishly then was forced in a bit leaving
the starting gate, was far back the opening half mile, swung to the five path in upper stretch and finished full of run. JAIMIE'S WARRIOR , slightly off the rail
chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. MAGIC IN ME raced in the two path on the turn and was not a factor.

PAY THE KID edged up between rivals early and gained a stalking spot, moved to engage the leader around the far turn, shook clear under coaxing past
the five sixteenths, spun into the lane three to four wide and widened under a steady drive. MISTER FRANK'S WAY saved ground advancing through the
backstretch run, raced in range into the far turn, chased to the inside of a rival leaving the far turn and churned on willingly be well clear of the rest. I'VE
GOTTA PLAN opened up early, set the pace two wide, was joined into the far turn, vied past the three eighths, could not match strides into the stretch then
faded in the final furlong. FUSED angled off the rail into the first turn, moved up between runners mid way through the backstretch run and had aim, chased
three wide leaving the five sixteenths then came up empty. MINT GAME ,three to four wide stalking the early pace, dropped back around the final turn. MO
AMERICAN was outrun.

Footnotes
GHOST STALKER stalked the pace outside ROARING RIVER down the backstretch, overtook that one mid way on the far turn, drifted out a bit turning for
home, was challenged on his outside in mid stretch then dug in tenaciously. MIAMI MUMBLES stalked the pace between horses down the backstretch,
circled the far turn three wide, angled to the four path turning for home, challenged for the lead in mid stretch and continued gamely to just miss. ROARING
RIVER , clear entering the first turn, set the pace near the rail, lost the lead on the far turn and weakened through the stretch. SPITBALL saved ground
around the turns, eased out entering the stretch, took aim on the lead in upper stretch and came up empty. SIR LENNY , off slowly, raced three wide on
both turns and weakened on the far turn. PERCHER trailed.

Footnotes
DREAM D'ORO sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, was guided three wide into the lane, kept on under right handed rousing past the furlong
grounds then was fully extended to last. FRANKEE MERCH edged up nearing the half mile marker, chased the winner three wide, shifted out wider in upper
stretch and continued gamely to gain. SING A VERSE , bumped at the break, was sent up between foes early and stalked, shifted in around the turn while
dropping back a bit, remained inside for the drive and found more to gain through the final furlong. COOKE BROTHERS , off the pace, raced three wide into
the lane, dropped in some and rallied between rivals. GATOR FIFTY TWO , unprepared at the break, broke a bit slow then steadied soon after, moved up in
the clear near the half mile marker, circled the turn, altered out five wide for the drive then flattened out. JUSTICE OF WAR came in at the break and
bumped with a rival, settled off the pace, angled wide for the drive and had belated action. OUTSIDE THE BOX saved ground and failed to menace.
HAZELS LITTLE MAN chased the pace, raced between rivals mid turn, failed to kick on entering the lane and retreated.

secured command in upper stretch, opened up in mid stretch and her rider briefly dropped his left rein approaching the finish. VIRGINIA BEACH bumped
with the winner at the break, stalked the duel around the turn, eased out to the four path in upper stretch and flattened out. GIFTED HEART hugged the
inner rail, disputed the pace to upper stretch then weakened. DECOUPAGE disputed the pace outside GIFTED HEART, turned for home between horses
and weakened. PHANTOM SHOT was not a factor.

Footnotes
GOLDIE'S BOY prompted the pace outside ROYALIAN, moved alongside leaving the three eighths, gained a slim lead in upper stretch, kept up the battle
from there and prevailed under a drive. ROYALIAN broke on top and set a pressured pace towards the inside, dueled from the five sixteenths, had his rider
lose the whip near the furlong grounds, kept on valiantly but wasn't quite good enough. GRECIAN PHAROAH tracked the contested pace while saving
ground, was under pressure pursuing into the lane but lacked a solid kick. JESTFUL lost ground four wide most of the way, chased the leaders into the lane,
raced on his left lead in the drive and came up empty. TRADITION , three deep prompting the pace, was under pressure past the five sixteenths, failed to
kick on in upper stretch and gave way. ROY G. BIV , between rivals early, dropped back leaving the far turn and failed to recover through the drive. GREY
GIANT , five wide around the first turn, dropped back leaving the half mile marker. PAPA LEW broke slowly, checked off heels into the first turn, angled off
the inside around the final turn and gave way.
