Footnotes
SURPRISE PARTY chased leader along the inside on the backstretch, continued to sit along the rail on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, took
aim on leader and drove past late to win clear. IMA SILVER LADY tracked leaders along the rail on the backstretch, entered turn along the rail, advanced
two wide midway through the turn, bid three wide at the top of the stretch, kept to task and finished up a willing second. WINDANSEA quickly cleared on the
backstretch, continued clear on the turn, entered stretch with a two length advantage, overtaken in deep stretch and yielded late to get edged out for
second. HUMOR ME HARPER off slow and broke out at the start, settled well of the pace outside of rival on the backstretch, entered turn two wide,
launched late bid along the rail to finish up well. MY BELLA CHICK stalked leaders off the rail on the backstretch, continued a path off the rail on the turn
and finished up one paced. DELIGHTFUL DORIS bothered by rival at the start, tracked two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, began to have
trouble cornering midway through the turn and drifted out wide into the stretch, after losing all chance on the turn rider coasted in to the finish. DIXIE LASSIE
broke well and in contention early, had awkward strides coming out of the chute and dropped back to last, after that trouble, failed to make an impact.

NORTH CROSS dueled two wide on the backstretch, continued to duel on the turn, entered stretch in the lead, entered stretch best of speed and dueled
with outside rival the length of the stretch and prevailed in a gallant effort. JOURNEY CAKE pressed leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three
wide on the turn, entered stretch three wide and dueled with winner finishing a game second. SHARP WARNING pressed leaders four wide on the
backstretch, angled in to take the turn two wide, bid three wide at the top of the stretch and stayed on well. LOST THE MINISTER tracked hot pace along
the inside, continued along the rail on the turn, eased out at the top of the stretch, split rivals in upper stretch and kept on in deep stretch to best rest.
DOHENY BEACH stalked leaders off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, launched bid along the inside and made mild late
progress. JACK COOL dueled with winner along the inside on the backstretch, entered turn head and head with rival, failed to match strides late on the turn
and yielded completely in upper stretch. CALIE VIEW tracked leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and failed to be a
factor in the stretch. JAY BOY tracked contested pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and came up empty in the stretch.
