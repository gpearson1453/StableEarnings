BANYAN BREEZE contested the lead along the rail, asked, kicked clear some and was under pressure for the win. JACOBA unhurried, saved ground,
responded inside and finished well. SMITE vied for the lead along the two path, chased and then missed the place. HONORABLE AVENUE unhurried along
the three path, four wide into the lane and made a late bid. BIJEMINI SLEW lacked early speed, three path into the turn, five wide out of it and failed to
threaten. SCORPION DYNASTY hopped a bit at the start, well placed along the three path and tired.

volleyed for the lead along the three path, two path into the lane and then was carried out late by the winner while finishing well. A DAB WILL DO unhurried
along the two path, lodged a bid inside, altered out for room nearing the sixteenth pole taking away the path of SINGLE VERSE and then finished well.
SINGLE VERSE well placed four wide into the turn, three path out of it and then took up nearing the sixteenths pole when A DAB WILL DO came out and
lost all chance. STEAL MY HEART three path on the turn and tired. A stewards inquiry was posted concerning the stretch run. Also a claim of foul was
lodged by the rider of SINGLE VERSE against A DAB WILL DO for interference at the sixteenths pole, resulted in the disqualification of A DAB WILL DO

Footnotes
BOBCAT set the pace along the two path, responded and held sway for the win. SHANGHAI NOON unhurried, gained inside into the lane and finished well.
GUSTY WIND never far back along the two path, eased out and was along for a share. AMERICAN TZAR tracked along the three path from the outset,
chased and weakened. DISCREET MISSION well placed four wide early, three path on the bend and weakened. JET SET CAT trailed without mishap.
