Footnotes
MISS ALEX showed good speed, disputed the pace between horses, vied in the two path while still between foes on the turn, led into upper stretch, drifted
out under a left-handed crop while inching clear approaching the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. SHINING COLORS brushed with a
foe at the start, contested the pace on the inside of three opponents, vied along the rail while inside of two foes on the turn, was asked at the
seven-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under strong urging, dropped back into the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. LASS was
bumped in the hindquarters at the start then stumbled, settled on the outside with the rider taking periodic peeks down to make sure everything was in order,
angled in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. THISLADYIS THE LAW bumped the
hindquarters of LASS at the start while off a half-step slow, recovered well to press the leading trio on the outside, vied outside of two foes in the three path
on the turn, was asked for more at the five-sixteenths then came under the crop, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. TIZ HER WAY was fractious in
the gate, broke out and bumped with a foe then was taken, moved well out in the track early, dropped inside MY LITTLE LULU as that foe fell back fast early
on the turn, went three to four wide on that bend and failed to respond. MY LITTLE LULU bumped with a rival at the start, disputed the pace between
horses, dropped back fast into the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
PAPA SMOOTH got bumped at the start by THE GREAT GAZOO due to pressure from D'VINICRIS breaking inwards and was hustled to the front, showed
the way lightly coaxed along just off the inside before tucking inside through the turn, came under pressure just inside the three-eighths from ON OUR WAY
BOYZ to the outside, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive safe to the eighth pole rebuffing the challenge of ON OUR WAY BOYZ
confronted by the runner up and held gamely to the finish to prevail. DAMILANO broke out at the start under hustling bumping MARC'S HUMOR into PAPA
SMOOTH before taking over that rival's path under hustling, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home,
offered up a mild kick to threaten through the final eighth but was ultimately repelled to the wire. ON OUR WAY BOYZ broke in a step at the start bumping
CHAIN BREAKER, chased three then two wide forwardly placed, advanced on the leader from the three-eighths to apply pressure through the latter portion
of the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was rebuffed inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages while safe for
the show honors. D'VINICRIS broke in at the start bumping THE GREAT GAZOO into PAPA SMOOTH and in turn MARC'S HUMOR, chased two to three
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. MARC'S HUMOR got bumped twice at the start, first due to
pressure from DAMILANO breaking outwards then from D'VINICRIS breaking inwards, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun
three wide for home and offered no response. THE GREAT GAZOO bumped between foes at the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. DISTRACTANDATTACK stumbled badly falling to his face at the start and recovered in a good
showing of agility by both horse and rider to stay upright conceding five to six lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, chased four then
three wide detached from the main body of the field, came under light coaxing midway on the turn, swung five wide for home and was unable to make an
impact. NAPOLEON COMPLEX three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing three
furlongs out, cornered four wide for home and tired. CHAIN BREAKER bumped at the start by ON OUR WAY BOYZ, who broke inwards at the start, chased
five then four wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, went six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TAPALIST five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out,
dug in knocking heads to the finish and gamely inched away to prevail. BEACH FRONT two to three wide in pursuit, advanced to take over narrow
command inside the three-eighths, knocked heads with BEATTHATFLEW trading the front through the latter portion of the turn, swung four wide for home,
dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, fought on inside to the finish clear of the rest and along second best. PIER FORTY coaxed from the gate,
chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors.
BEATTHATFLEW four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and advanced to get on near even terms for command at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off and weakened in the stretch. REVENIO broke in at the start and was
corrected coming under hustling to advanced to prompt the leader, tipped to the two path through the turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung two to three wide for home and weakened. ANZIO BEACH broke open the stall door prior to the start, vied briefly with a trio before establishing sole
command showing the way coaxed along three then two wide under some pressure from REVENIO along the inside, tucked inside through the turn and
came under challenge yielding the front just inside the three-eighths pole, swung three to four wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
RUN CURTIS RUN broke a half-step slow, chased the pace on the outside, gained to make a bid while dropping from the three to two wide early on the
turn, dueled outside of the runner-up into upper stretch, brushed with that foe coming to the furlong marker, fought gamely to the wire and narrowly prevailed
under strong urging. SURPRISE BOSS showed good speed and went clear early, vied along the rail while challenged on the turn, dueled inside of the
winner into upper stretch, brushed with that foe nearing the furlong marker, battled gamely to the wire and just missed while well clear for the place. RAW
COURAGE chased the pace on the inside of the winner, paused off heels in the two path near the seven-sixteenths then shifted to the three path, dropped
back under a drive late on that bend and lacked the needed response while no match for the top two but was best of the rest. HEART OF SAVINO was
urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. PICKERING CIRCLE was urged along off the pace, started the turn in the two
path then shifted four wide, continued four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. KHALI'S DREAM dropped back early then came out into the turn,
went three wide on that bend, drifted in near the furlong marker and was no factor. RED JET was last to commence then urged along on the outside, went
four wide early on the turn then dropped to the rail just inside the seven-sixteenths, saved ground from that point into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
A BIT O'IRISH SASS dueled from the two path with CANDY MONET to her inside down the backstretch, shook off that rival tucking inside near the
seven-sixteenths and came under confrontation by RAFFINITY advancing outside three furlongs from home, knocked heads with that rival through the latter
portion of the turn and took the inside route into upper stretch, then edged clear under a drive kept to task to the finish. RAFFINITY four wide in range of the
duel, tucked three wide into the turn and advanced to knock heads with the aforementioned foe from the three-eighths through the latter portion of the turn,
swung three then two wide into upper stretch, got shaken off at the three-sixteenths, dug in and kept on to just preserve the place honors at the wire.
EPONA'S DREAM chased along the inside from near the rear coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and ran on to miss for
the place honors while well clear of the rest. TAPPLE CIDER coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide coming under a prolonged drive with
seven-sixteenths to run, swung four wide for home and weakened. HOLY BREEZE four to five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung five wide for home and tired. CANDY MONET was away to stutter step start, dueled inside of A BIT O'IRISH SASS down the backstretch and into the
turn, got shaken off with seven-sixteenths remaining and gave chase through the bend, cut the corner into upper stretch and folded. CALI FITZ three then
two wide just off the duel down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded and went six to seven wide into upper stretch, tired and was
eased through to the finish.

UNCLE MOONLIGHT settled at the rear while between horses, was asked in the three path early on the turn, brushed with a foe leaving the backstretch,
jostled with FINAL near the three-eighths then moved four wide, chased outside into the stretch, made an outside bid under a right-handed crop at the
three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed crop while battling with two foes inside the furlong marker, went back to a right-handed crop while getting to the
front inside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. PARADE FIELD stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was
asked outside the quarter-pole, took the lead in upper stretch, was put to a left-handed crop into the final furlong, led into the final sixteenth but was caught
while clear for the place. LIAM'S FIRE was hustled to the front, showed the way through solid fractions while off the inside, went around the turn in the two
path, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the runner-up outside the three-sixteenths, fought with two opponents into the final
furlong and was outfinished while well clear for the show. KID BOURBON was moving around a bit at the start then slow into stride, moved up then was
rated off the pace, raced in the two path early on the turn, dropped to the rail while asked at the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive into the final furlong
and tired. FINGAL settled on the outside, brushed with UNCLE MOONLIGHT leaving the backstretch, went four wide while asked early on the turn, jostled
with the aforementioned rival at the three-eighths then dropped back and faltered.

Footnotes
KLICKITAT prompted the pace on the outside in the three path, turned up the pressure on the leader on the far turn, took over outside the quarter-pole,
responded well when set down into upper stretch and edged clear under strong urging. COLD HARD CASH was taken in hand early then rated while two to
three wide, came under urging late on the far turn, chased the winner in the stretch and finished willingly while second best. GHOST GIANT brushed with a
foe at the start, raced just off the pace while rated inside to the two path, was let out on the far turn then hesitantly ridden behind the winner into upper
stretch, came under a drive around the three-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the show. GOOD OLD BOY went
three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, tucked into the two path on the far turn, was roused on that bend, moved out some under a drive in upper
stretch and failed to threaten. QUIET OUT EAST was taken in hand early, saved ground on the first turn, settled comfortably towards the rear on the
backstretch, went three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SOMETHINGTOTELLYOU brushed with a
rival at the start, went to the front, showed the way along the rail through moderate fractions, came under pressure on the far turn, lost the lead to the winner
outside the quarter-pole and gave way. NUTZFORBOLTZ angled in early, settled on the inside, shifted three wide while roused early on the far turn, moved
to five wide late on that bend then came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MO FAITH went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside,
was asked with a half-mile to turn, went three to four wide under urging on the final turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and came up empty. Races
with rail setting out 35 feet are hand timed.
