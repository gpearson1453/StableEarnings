MISS BILLIE K sped to the lead at the start, set the pace through the backstretch and held firm around the far turn, was set down three wide for the drive
and pulled away. G'S DEADLINE tracked the pace outside through the backstretch, coaxed four wide around the far turn, sustained a steady five wide bid in
the lane and captured place. LIMAGE was forwardly placed around the first turn then stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, launched a three wide
bid around the far turn, stayed on with response in the lane and got nipped for place. HAPPY SONRISA was allowed top settle in early stages, picked up the
pace two wide around the far turn, sustained a steady two wide bid through the lane and just missed a share. SEE SASSY RUN raced in range along the
inside, saved ground around the far turn then flattened out in the upper stretch. TIZ ONE FEE was forwardly placed in the backstretch then weakened
entering the far turn and failed to re-gain close contention.

Footnotes
RIVETRIX dueled outside of PALAIS for the early lead while racing clear over the next pursuer, shook free at the head of the lane the pulled away under
steady pressure. PALAIS dueled inside of RIVETRIX for the early lead, battled on around the turn, could not match strides with the winner in the upper
stretch but stayed on gamely and held place. MISS PRONOUNCE raced in pursuit of the embattled top pair, saved ground around the turn, tipped out a
path at the head of the lane, sustained a steady bid and gained show. LINE OF FAITH raced off the early speed, was ridden along four wide into the lane
and lacked the needed kick for serious impact. MARCIAMARCIAMARCIA chased the top pair into the turn, stayed on three to four wide in the upper stretch
then flattened out. THEBOYZTAP lacked early foot, saved ground and lacked a needed rally. EMMAS RULER was off a step slow at the start and never
menaced.

Footnotes
GUILTY LOVER rated inside near mid-pack through early stages, waited for a clear path at the quarter pole, given cue inside at the head of the lane, roused
forward and vied with HOG WILD then drew clear. HOG WILD tracked the pace through the backstretch, coaxed three wide around the far turn, vied for the
lead with GUILTY LOVER at the eighth pole then failed to kick on with the winner. PREFERRED PROSPECT stalked through early stages, raced between
foes and lacked clear racing room at the quarter pole, angled out wider for the drive, sustained a steady bid and gained show. MY SUGAR TOWN rated two
wide through the backstretch, urged to pick up the pace around the far turn, raced three wide into the lane and had no kick. ONE HITTER hopped at the
start then settled through early stages, was ridden along four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. FLY GUY RAK led the way around the first turn,
set the pace and held firm around the final turn, vied for the lead in the upper stretch then gave way. CAJUNS GOLDEN POND raced near midpack, hustled
along five wide into the lane and flattened out. GROVER CAPOTE raced off the pace, saved ground on the final turn and had no response. LIGHTNING
LEE raced off the pace and had no response when called upon. ARLINGTON'S SHINE raced four wide around the turns and never menaced.

CAMEO DANCER tracked the pace in the opening quarter then moved up a bit closer around the turn, was set down three wide for the drive, took over the
lead nearing the eighth pole and kept clear under a driving finish. HEREWECOMETOGETYOU raced off the top two flights at the three eighths pole, was
ridden along four wide into the lane and produced a solid finish. ZION prompted the pace along the outside, launched a bid for the leader around the turn,
sustained a steady two wide bid through the lane and held a share. SABER RUN set the pace, held firm over pursuers around the turn then got collared by
the winner in the upper stretch. DAPPER DAN MAN was off awkwardly at the start, raced two to three wide into the lane and never threatened. MONEY
AND ME chased the top two leaders inside around the turn then gave way. OUR FREDDIE MAC raced off the pace, went five wide into the lane and lacked
a needed rally. OUR SEXY A. P. raced off the pace, went two to three wide into the stretch drive and failed to respond.
