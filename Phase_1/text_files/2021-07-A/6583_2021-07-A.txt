Footnotes
W W TRAFALGAR was hustled up in tight quarters to get the lead, was clear of the rest before finishing the first furlong, took the rail, allowed to relax,
roused again leaving the bend then steadily opened up in the lane while kept to a drive until the final seventy yards. LINE OF DENHAMS raced in the
second flight just outside TO THE BANK, moved clear for second on the turn, floated out some entering the stretch then could only just hold his position
late. TO THE BANK prominent from inside, could only make up minor ground on LINE OF DENHAMS deep stretch. STOSH chased from just off the inside,
improved position on the bend, swung widest for the stretch run and showed a willingness to run late. BEE ATTACK was hustled along from outside but
faded three wide on the turn.

Footnotes
MIKE'S LADY broke outward starting a chain reaction of jostling, quickly recovered to set a narrow pace in hand, was let out on the second bend, roused
leaving that turn, lengthened command upper stretch then held off BULU under steady handling. BULU jostled with MI SANDIA at the break, was kept close
from outside, came in the lane from path four, rallied belatedly but caught GRAMMAR for second inside the final sixteenth. GRAMMAR vied for the lead
outside MIKE'S LADY, floated out some entering the lane and lacked the extra needed between rivals deep stretch. MI SANDIA jostled between horses at
the start, chased from inside, rallied along the rail in the lane but was too late. INSTA GLAM soon trailed from along the rail, angled out some on the second
bend then gradually lugged in through the lane. The first quarter mile fraction is unavailable.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S SICILIAN rated on the front end inside MY WIFE IS BOSS, edged ahead on the turn, was roused with two furlongs left then steadily opened up
through the lane while kept to a drive until the final seventy yards. KLONDIKE ANNIE advanced from inside on the turn, gradually closed the gap on MY
WIFE IS BOSS in the stretch and took over second in the waning yards. MY WIFE IS BOSS disputed the pace from outside, did not stay with GHAALEB'S
SICILIAN leaving the turn, floated out some entering the stretch and slowly wore down in the late going. LADY WARRIOR pressed the early pace from
between rivals, did not keep up two wide on the bend, fanned four wide into the lane and made up minor ground on the second tier deep stretch. BIT
MONEY raced in contention from outside on the backstretch, did not keep up into the turn, took the rail and lacked a significant stretch bid. FOXIE'S
BEAUTY unruly in the gate prestart, was taken out then reloaded, was hustled along at the start and an early factor, faded three wide on the bend, swung
out further into the stretch and made up some ground the final furlong.

POCKET PLAYER well back early, though urged along from the start, picked up his pace just off the inside on the bend, fanned three wide into the stretch,
took the lead inside the last eighth and was drawing off the final sixteenth. TIZRIK broke alertly, was soon sharing the lead inside WILD FOX, moved clear
when allowed on the turn, could not hold back POCKET PLAYER inside the final furlong but was unchallenged for second. THE LAST OPTION chased from
outside, lacked a significant stretch response but pulled away for third the last eighth. WILD FOX disputed the early pace, did not stay with TIZRIK on the
turn and quickly faded through the lane.

Footnotes
ARCH FLYER broke alertly, was rated on the front end outside ASHLEY ELIZABETH, moved ahead when asked upper stretch then drew off under a drive
the final furlong. DARLIN ROSIE raced in the second flight between rivals on the backstretch, angled in nearing the quarter pole, vied for the lead briefly
entering the lane, could not stay with DIAMOND STELLAR the last eighth but was unchallenged for second. DIAMOND STELLAR bumped at the break and
in tight briefly, was hustled along from inside, gained third upper stretch, still threatened with a furlong left, leveled off in the late going but was easily best of
the others. GHAALEB'S APPEAL broke inward, bumping DIAMOND STELLAR, raced in contention from outside, three to five wide taking the turn and
flattened out for the drive. ASHLEY ELIZABETH brushed with DIAMOND STELLAR at the start, was rushed up to dispute the pace inside ARCH FLYER,
stayed off the inside on the bend, was overtaken from both sides leaving the turn, angled out upper stretch, faded and was drifting out in the late going.

Footnotes
LONG LEGGED LINDA broke on top and was hustled along to set a pressure pace just off the inside, had the rail on the bend, floated out some as she was
put to a drive leaving the turn, drew clear, began to wear down deep stretch but held on under steady handling. ALMAFUERTE well placed inside, came off
the rail some nearing the turn, did not keep up, moved back to the rail into the stretch, rallied inside the last furlong, angled out with a sixteenth left as her
path narrowed, closed well and edged ahead for second in the waning yards. LIL B QUICK forwardly placed from outside, oved clear for third three wide on
the bend, fanned out further entering the lane, also rallied inside the final eighth, fought for second inside the last sixteenth, missed but was clearly best of
the rest. KALISPELL contested the pace outside LONG LEGGED LINDA for a half mile, did not stay with that one upper stretch and flattened out between
rivals inside the last furlong. TROPHY BRIDLE bumped with AMERICAN HOLIDAY leaving the chute, chased from well off the inside, lost ground widest
through the bend but showed a willingness to run deep stretch. AMERICAN HOLIDAY bumped with TROPHY BRIDLE leaving the chute, was an early factor
just off the inside, failed to keep up along the rail on the turn, fanned out into the stretch and made up minor ground the final eighth. CAROL'S A CASE
trailed, saved ground through the bend and had little to offer the last quarter mile.
