DOCTOR K cruised to the early lead, was steered to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, remained along the rail and was under the whip in mid
stretch. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND , two wide throughout, gamely chased the winner. SAM AND SY came out at the break lightly bumping NEW YORK ONE,
hugged the inner rail on the turn, swung to the three path at the head of the stretch and was always outrun. SWING YOUR SWORD , three deep on the
turn, was fanned four wide entering the stretch and failed to be a factor. NEW YORK ONE , lightly bumped leaving the starting gate, chased the pace down
the backstretch and faltered after a half mile.

Footnotes
MR. MOX was nudged clear after a sixteenth of a mile, set the pace under a light hold while about two wide, edged away a bit after being put to strong
asking inside the three sixteenths then held firm while surrounded late. BUFF HELLO stalked two wide, was under pressure mid turn, pursued between
rivals into the lane, shifted out a bit and continued gamely to gain and earn the place. SLAATS steadied lightly while saving ground into the turn, stayed
inside to stalk, edged up along the rail leaving the sixteenth pole and kept on with good energy. POWERFUL FORCE , ridden from the gate, advanced three
deep mid turn to take aim, failed to seriously kick on near mid stretch, drifted out soon after and faded. CASA GRANDE broke a step slow and failed to
menace. GALLANT GOLD , off slowly, was outrun.

PEPPI THE HUNTER dropped in towards the rail soon after the break and settled, eased out advancing into the far turn, rolled up three wide under coaxing
and challenged approaching the stretch, kicked clear under a drive past the three sixteenths, turned away a threat from ALWAYS FORGIVEN, drifted in
towards the rail then held firm while kept to task. ALWAYS FORGIVEN , unhurried early while off the rail, circled four wide making headway into the lane,
had aim on the winner in mid stretch, failed to seriously kick on but was clearly best of the rest. FIND YOUR BOAZ lacked speed, was under pressure off
the rail leaving the far turn, circled four wide and passed faders. SHAKA STYLE bobbled at the break, rushed up early and bid outside the leader around the
first turn, rated back to stalk, came back some under a ride past the five sixteenths, failed to go on leaving the three sixteenths and weakened. BLUE
DANUBE sped clear early along the rail then took pressure past the seven eighths, kicked back clear soon into the backstretch, set the pace towards the
rail, was collared near the lane, stayed on past the three sixteenths then tired. ITGOT GRANDMA chased along the inside, stayed in range to about the
quarter pole then faltered.

BEACON HILL stalked the pace outside SUE LOVES BARBADOS, overtook that one in upper stretch and drew out with something in reserve. ARTISTIC
ENDEAVOR raced in the two path between horses around both turns, angled out in upper stretch and offered a mild rally on his left lead. BENNY HAVENS
saved ground on the turns, remained inside horses in the stretch and flattened out. JOHNG , angled in early, hugged the inner rail on both turns, eased out
for the drive and passed tired foes. CALL ME PLUCKY lacked speed between horses, swung out for the drive and passed tired foes. FERMAT , outside
horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn four wide, floated to the seven path in mid stretch and was no threat. SPEED GAME , three wide both
turns, chased the pace and gave way. SUPER E was no factor. SUE LOVES BARBADOS set a slow pace along the inner rail and faltered approaching the
eighth pole. BELTWAY BOB , squeezed back leaving the starting gate, raced wide on the far turn.

BOBBY TWO TIMES , into the race soon after the start, dueled inside under a rating hold, edged clear under a light hold leaving the far turn, turned away a
threat nearing the lane, opened up after being set down soon after, widened under a drive in mid stretch then coasted home through the final yards.
WHERE'S THE BEN'S , unhurried early while saving ground, moved up along the fence past the five sixteenths, angled three wide into the lane,
straightened and churned on willingly to gain the place. GOTTAWAY broke a bit slow, quickly recovered and advanced along the rail to track the duel,
eased out to take aim of the winner approaching the stretch, gave futile pursuit past the furlong grounds and flattened out. BIG RINNE was rated between
rivals into the first turn, dropped well off the pace after a half mile, angled in nearing the lane but lacked a rally. MARU'S RAVEN , three wide stalking the
leaders, was ridden along chasing past the five sixteenths, came five wide for the drive and weakned. ARBUTUS was used two wide dueling outside the
winner, failed to kick on nearing the five sixteenths and faltered. GHOST ON A MISSION lost ground four wide, moved up slightly into the far turn, lacked a
response past the three eighths and faltered.

Footnotes
GUNNISON lacked speed, hugged the inner rail entering the far turn, eased out approaching the stretch, swung to the five path in upper stretch, closed
determinedly on his left lead and was up near the finish. HAWKISH lacked speed, circled the far turn four deep, advanced outside horses to gain the lead
inside the sixteenth pole then tired and hung. VANZZY had a shoe fixed in the paddock, moved to a two wide lead on the backstretch, remained in front to
inside the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. MISSIN THE BIG DOG failed to keep pace down the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, eased out
in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. BALLAGH ROCKS , along the inner rail on the far turn, steadied lacking room approaching the stretch,
remained along the rail in the stretch and weakened. WORKIN ON A DREAM offered a three wide advance on the far turn then gave way. JUST WHISTLE
was done on the far turn. SARATOGA JACK taken snugly in hand soon after the break, was very rank on a rival's heels entering the first turn, remained
snugly in hand down the backstretch, was well placed outside horses entering the far turn then gave way turning for home.

Footnotes
JACKIE A settled well off the rail and off of a contested pace, circled the turn four wide, shifted five wide with run soon into the lane, rallied outside under a
drive and joined VOLTAMOUR past the furlong grounds, dueled, gained a slim advantage inside the sixteenth pole and held firm. VOLTAMOUR rated off
the pace, advanced inside mid turn, angled four wide into the stretch, bid between foes past the eighth pole, gained brief lead, dueled inside the winner and
kept on gamely. PREMIERE CHOICE had speed in hand and to the inside of a pair of rivals, handled outside pressure around the turn, shook clear in upper
stretch, could not contain rivals past the eighth pole and faded late. LOOKATLITTLEFERRIS , three deep with the pace heading to the half mile pole, bid
outside the leader mid turn, pressed to the three sixteenths then weakened late. UNCOMMON VALOR ducked in towards the gap while rank out of the gate,
dropped well off the early pace and failed to threaten. BALTIMORE BUD forced the early pace between rivals, failed to keep up past the five sixteenths then
retreated.
