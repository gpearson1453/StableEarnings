and held on well late for the win. ONE NIGHT STAND raced three wide early, stalked three wide, rallied three wide into the stretch, finished willingly but
second best. RACK DADDY tracked close up on the inside, made a rail bid at the half mile marker, was shuffled back a bit entering the far turn, then chased
on the rail and rallied mildly in the stretch. FACTS ONLY raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the far turn and lacked a rally. MISS PARFAIT stalked
between rivals, chased on the far turn and failed to respond. OUR WEST INDY dueled two wide for the early lead, then chased, raced between rivals at the
quarter pole and faded. TWO GRACES was bumped at the start, raced four wide into the first turn, settled off the pace and did not factor. MI CLEOPATRA
AND I was bumped at the start and steadied, trailed the field, moved up three wide on the far turn, then gave way in the stretch.
