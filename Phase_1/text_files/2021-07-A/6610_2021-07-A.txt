Footnotes
LIVELY LEA took over the lead after leaving the first turn and set the pace through the backstretch, held firm around the far turn, was ridden along two wide
into the lane, found more in reserve under steady pressure and held clear. SCRAPBOOK led the way around the first turn then conceded position to LIVELY
LEA in the early backstretch, tracked rival to the far turn, saved ground into the lane, raced in striking distance along the rail with a furlong left to run,
sustained a steady bid but could nor reach the winner. PHILOSOPHICALLY stalked the pacesetter through early stages, launched a bid for command
around the far turn, raced in close contention at the furlong grounds, chased on three wide and could not reach the winner. TEXAS SPRING was unhurried
out of the gate and trailed through early stages, was ridden along four wide into the lane and never threatened. PEANUT raced off the early pace, moved
into the stretch run three wide and failed to move into contention. MO STYLISH was a step awkward at the start, raced off the pace then bolted around the
far turn and eased up.

Footnotes
GOLDEN PAREE stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, let out a notch and took command entering the far turn, quickly cleared on top, saved
ground into the lane, stayed sharp and remained well clear. PINTLALA lunged at the start and trailed through early stages, remained reserved around the
far turn, swung into the lane four wide, rallied strongly along the outside and cleared second best. SHARPERTHANME raced off the early pace, hustled
along three wide into the lane, drifted out wider in the drive and got up late for show. DIALED J rated in range through middle stages, launched a three wide
bid around the far turn, gained position then flattened out in the lane. DAD'S STAR CAT stalked along the inside, angled out at the quarter pole and failed to
kick on. DREAMIT stumbled badly at the start but quickly recovered and was forwardly placed around the first turn, weakened after the opening quarter and
raced off the pace, saved ground around the far turn and had no late response. DIVIDED set the pace, got collared by the winner entering the far turn and
dropped back.
