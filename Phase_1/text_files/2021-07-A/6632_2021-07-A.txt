LOYALTY SPIRIT raced evenly rallying on the far turn giving steady surge from the seven path down the lane arriving in time. PONT DU GARD stalked the
pace pressing to lead on the far turn digging in from the three path down the lane missing to wide pressure. ATLANTIC SUN (GB) rallied on the far turn
dueling from the four path down the lane battling to the wire. THE CATMANCAN tracked evenly losing ground to upper stretch racing in contention late
lacking punch in the eight path. JUDAH gave a prompted middle move dueling along the inside through the far turn into upper stretch weakening late in the
two path. CLEANUP HITTER slow early played no factor. FINE failed to mount a credible bid. DREAMING OF FRANK rushed clear set the early pace then
stopped into the far turn.
