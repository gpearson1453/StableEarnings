Footnotes
ESTARDO was placed on the lead, edged further clear while saving ground on the turn, opened up further under a drive in the lane, and was in hand past
the sixteenth pole when still well clear. ZIDIKAI raced in the rear flight early inside of NEXT TIME YOU WIN, continued at the rear in the two path on the
turn, began to improve when urged near the five sixteenths, angled out in upper stretch, rallied past DULCE MARIA for place approaching the sixteenth pole
and finished in hand a clear second best. DULCE MARIA broke sharply and was hustled but was outsprinted by ESTARDO, tracked that leader down the
backstretch, chased while saving ground around the turn but gradually lost ground behind ESTARDO, flattened out in the lane and lost the place near the
sixteenth. NEXT TIME YOU WIN raced two wide in the rear flight down the backstretch, was pushed along from second last in the three to four path on the
turn and offered a mild bid, flattened from near the five sixteenths, was carried out slightly in upper stretch when ZIDIKAI began to angle out, and was not
persevered with late.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT FROST was urged to the lead right out of the gate, showed the way from the rail up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering
the stretch and was kept to the task to the wire. TORN JEANS tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path,
couldn't go with the winner in the stretch and chased her home, the best of the rest. PEACE NICKER raced in the middle of the pack between horses
through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path, offered a mild bid nearing the quarter pole and finished evenly. PLANTS AND
BIRDS stalked the leader on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and weakened on the rail in the stretch. LOCASH raced at the back
of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. FOX ABLE CHARLIE hopped up leaving the gate, trailed the
field on the outside from there, raced in the two and three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, drifted in sharply with a furlong to go and
was empty from there.

Footnotes
KING TITO was put on the lead, took mild pressure from MOMMAS BOY OTIS approaching the half, edged clear of that foe near the three eighths while
leading in the two path, increased his advantage when put to a drive approaching midstretch, and continued to edge further clear. SIMPLE LOGIC tracked
between horses early, took back to join the rear flight inside of POWER THROUGH after being put in tight near the half mile, improved inside from past the
seven sixteenths, carried GOOD YEGG out in upper stretch when coming out, rallied under a drive and got up for the place a sixteenth of a mile out.
MOMMAS BOY OTIS tracked four wide early, advanced to prompt outside of KING TITO approaching the half, stalked two wide past the three eighths once
that pacesetter edged clear again, chased the leader inside down the stretch while proving no match, flattened and lost the place a sixteenth out. GOOD
YEGG raced at the inside of the tracking flight early, was pushed along into the turn to track the leading pair, chased between horses past the seven
sixteenths, was carried out at the head of the stretch when SIMPLE LOGIC swung out for his bid, and weakened. POWER THROUGH settled at the rear
early, raced two wide into the turn in the rear flight, was pushed along at the rear in the four path on the turn and into the lane, and lacked the needed rally.
LAKE MILLS tracked three wide between horses early, chased the leading pair three wide around the turn, was driven three wide into the lane and emptied
out.

SMACK was fractious in the gate, broke well and raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, moved up
to challenge while racing in the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off down the lane. PRINCESS CORA saved ground
around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path approaching the three eighths pole, and
gained ground on the outside while no match for the winner. APOLLO U ANYWHERE led the field from the rail around the first turn and up the backstretch,
dueled while saving ground around the far turn, gave way entering the stretch and finished evenly. WANNA HAVE FUN saved ground around the first turn,
trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn, and gained ground mildly in late stretch. BETTER ANGELS hopped up leaving the
gate, trailed the field from the two path through the opening half mile, began to move up from the two path while racing around the far turn and was
outkicked from there. HER GOLD MINE chased the leader while saving ground around the first turn, began to drop back while racing inside up the

Footnotes
OFFLEE FUN settled at the rear, began to edge closer in the two path on the turn, swung out for a bid in earnest approaching the quarter, came four wide
into the lane, was bumped between horses in upper stretch, nonetheless kept his stride, rallied four wide, led nearing the furlong mark and drove clear.
BETWEENHEREANDCOOL tracked the leading line early, settled back near the rear as field separated approaching the half, raced three wide in the rear
flight through the turn, began to rally approaching the quarter, swung five wide into the lane, bumped with OFFLEE FUN in upper stretch, sustained his rally,
proved no match for OFFLEE FUN in the final furlong but still kept on willingly to prove second best. TRE LEE DIVINE tracked the pace between horses
early, continued to track the leading pair into the turn, tracked the leader outside of GREELEYS ICE around the bend, came into the lane three wide, came
out in upper stretch and bumped OFFLEE FUN, kept on in range to midstretch until being outkicked into the final furlong. ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS took
a narrow lead between horses early, edged clear in the two path on the turn, was driven two wide in upper stretch while on a narrowing lead two wide, got
swallowed up approaching the furlong mark and weakened. GREELEYS ICE attended the pace early inside of ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS, tracked the
leader while saving ground around the turn, was driven inside into the lane, continued in range inside to midstretch and emptied out in the final furlong.
FRENCH MINDED was forward outside early, settled back approaching the half, emptied out between horses on the turn, and was not persevered with in
the lane.

Footnotes
BEYOND PROPER settled in behind the leaders for the run up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, swung out to the four path to began
a bid nearing the quarter pole, drifted in passing the three sixteenths pole, relinquished her lead with a sixteenth of a mile to go, and battled back gamely to
get her head in front at the wire. COLOROFACLOUD raced off the pace on the outside early, angled in to save ground around the turn, swung wide entering
the stretch to gain ground on the outside, and dueled gamely through the final furlong, just missing the win. JOAN'S WAY dropped back to trail the field on
the outside in the opening stages, raced in the two path around the turn, and passed tiring horses in the stretch. MY MY MUNNY brushed with the horse to
her outside leaving the gate, recovered to duel on the inside up the backstretch, dropped behind the leaders while racing in the two and three path around
the turn, and made a mild gain of ground in late stretch. VIETNAM hit the gate leaving it, raced inside in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter
of a mile, saved ground around the turn and weakened on the rail in the stretch. HIPPIE COWGIRL dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch
and around the turn, began to drop back in upper stretch, steadied slightly when BEYOND PROPER drifted into her lane near the three sixteenths pole, and
continued to tire from there. HEAVENLY SCENT veered in leaving the gate, dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving
ground around the turn, and tired entering the stretch. TAP IT OVER brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, dueled for the lead between
horses for a quarter mile, began to drop back entering the turn, steadied slightly as she was starting to tire, was taken wide from there, entered the stretch in
the six path and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DOLLAR BLUE tracked the leading pair, was pushed along three wide on the far turn and offered a bid past the three eighths, loomed at the quarter, was
outkicked by P H FACTOR into the lane but continued his pursuit, rallied three wide in the final furlong and got up in the final fifty yards. DUCHOSSOIS
pressed outside the leader through the clubhouse turn, tracked the pace down the backstretch, reengaged to press outside of P H FACTOR around the far
turn, continued to give chase when P H FACTOR kicked clear again in upper stretch, drifted in on BARLEEWON late, was narrowly outfinished for the win
but got the nod for place. P H FACTOR set the pace while pressed by DUCHOSSOIS through the clubhouse turn, inched clear down the backstretch, was
reengaged to his outside by DUCHOSSOIS while saving ground through the far turn, kicked clear briefly in upper stretch under a drive, flattened in the final
sixteenth and was caught. JIMMY D chased two wide through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, took closer order three wide on the far turn,
was carried out in upper stretch by BOURBON TAN, and rallied mildly three wide late. BARLEEWON chased inside of JIMMY D through the clubhouse turn
and down the backstretch, took closer order at the inside of the chasing flight through the far turn, raced in range in the two path in upper stretch, kept on
with interest in range past midstretch, steadied slightly late when DUCHOSSOIS came in late, and was outfinished. BOURBON TAN hopped at the start,
raced at the rear inside of HIGH ON SUGAR early, raced in second last through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, took closer order between
horses through the far turn, came into the lane between horses, drifted out in upper stretch, kept on with interest but was outfinished. HIGH ON SUGAR
raced two wide in the rear flight early, settled at the rear into the clubhouse turn, gradually lost touch with the field down the backstretch, saved ground
through the turn and had no rally in the lane.
