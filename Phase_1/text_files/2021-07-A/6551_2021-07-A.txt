Footnotes
TIZ A QUEEN grazed the gate on the way out, was sent for speed, vied outside of GRAPEVINE down the backstretch, cleared into the turn and set the
pace in the two path, was asked into upper stretch and responded by increasing her advantage, and stayed on well clear while kept to task. GRAPEVINE
was off sharply, vied inside of TIZ A QUEEN early, tracked her in the three path on the turn, proved no match in the lane but kept on evenly late under a
drive. Z U IN MY DREAMS settled at the rear, was pushed to improve outside horses in the four to five path on the turn, came three wide into upper stretch,
and proved no match for the leading pair but best of the rest. GOLD GEM lightly bumped with LA GUERRERITA in the opening strides, chased the leading
pair three wide early, chased between horses in the three path on the turn, came into upper stretch between horses, and lacked the needed kick. LA
GUERRERITA lightly bumped with GOLD GEM in the opening strides, chased well behind the leader between horses on the backstretch, raced in the two
path at the inside of the chasing flight on the turn, was driven for a mild inside bid into the lane, but flattened out. CESSO chased well behind the leading
pair inside, took up just past the half mile mark, trailed while saving ground on the turn, and had no rally inside in the lane.

Footnotes
NICKY TWO SHOES was urged to the lead right out of the gate, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground
around the far turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off down the lane, much the best. SAVAGE pressed the pace on the outside through the
opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn, couldn't go with the winner entering the stretch, and chased that rival home, the best of the
rest. GATE CREW settled behind the leaders on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, and was outkicked in the
stretch while finishing evenly. WAVE'NDUMONI trailed the field on the outside in the early going, began to drop back further while racing in the two and
three path around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
KINGSBURY DREAM settled at the rear, was pushed along and began to improve into the turn, took closer order in the five path on the turn, was driven
three wide into the lane and then taken out five wide in upper stretch, rallied with good interest and got up near forty yards out. LION LOVE was grazed by
MANHATTAN LEGACY in the opening strides, settled near the rear, took closer order in the three path on the turn while at the rear of the field, bid in
earnest up the inside into the lane, sustained that rail rally in upper stretch, split horses past the furlong mark, drove to the lead near the sixteenth, but was
caught near forty yards out. RARE ACTION ATTACK broke inward, settled near the rear inside, took closer order as the field contracted approaching the
turn, continued to improve while saving ground around the bend, was driven two wide in upper stretch, kept on under urging while three wide between
horses past midstretch, and was outfinished in the final sixteenth. RANK AND FILE was herded inward when LAUNCH AWAY broke inward and bumped
into MANHATTAN LEGACY as a result, tracked the pace inside of LAUNCH AWAY down the chute, took the lead inside of that foe past the three quarters,
continued to set the pace in the two path on the turn, was confronted by LAUNCH AWAY past the three eighths but turned her away into the lane, continued
to lead past midstretch under a drive, but shortened stride midstretch and was caught with a sixteenth of a mile to go. LAUNCH AWAY broke inward on
RANK AND FILE, was keen to the lead down the chute, tracked the pace set by RANK AND FILE past the three quarters, continued to talk in the four path
on the turn, bid past the three eighths, loomed approaching the quarter, but was turned away into the lane, had nothing further when driven in upper stretch
and weakened. MANHATTAN LEGACY was bumped by RANK AND FILE in the opening strides and grazed LION LOVE as a result, tracked the leading
pair down the backstretch, flattened between horses in the three path on the turn, was driven between horses into the lane but proved empty.

Footnotes
ONE WAY HOME saved ground around the first turn, led the field by daylight up the backstretch, began to open up further while saving ground around the
far turn, and drew off down the lane under a drive, in command throughout. ANDREAS saved ground while trailing the field around the first turn and up the
backstretch, began a bid from the rail nearing the three eighths pole, chased the winner home down the stretch and had to settle for second best.
ANGELINO saved ground while racing off the pace in the early going, raced between horses headed into the far turn, navigated that turn from the three
path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground mildly on the outside but was no match for the top two. PENALTY SHOT raced in the two
path in the middle of the pack through the opening three furlongs, began to move up on the outside while racing up the backstretch, came around the far
turn in the two path and flattened out from there. CALL THE COLONEL raced in the two path at the back of the pack around the first turn and up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and made no bid. ZANFORCE stumbled slightly leaving the gate,
saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, began to drop back while continuing to save ground around the far turn and tired
further in the stretch.

Footnotes
NOFANSINTHESTANDS was reluctant to load, raced at the inside of the rear pair through the clubhouse turn, settled at the rear down the backstretch, was
pushed along and improved two wide on the far turn, was driven three wide into the lane, continued to improve, took the lead past the furlong mark and
rolled clear. GIRLS COUNT was fractious in the gate, bobbled in the opening strides, led inside into the first turn, was headed near the seven eighths,
stalked inside of ISABIS until the three fourths, was taken back to the rear as others bid outside the new leader, advanced again to join the inside of the
tracking flight past the five eighths, settled back again to the rear flight inside of NOFANSINTHESTANDS near the half, chased in range around the far turn,
was urged between horses in upper stretch, proved no match for NOFANSINTHESTANDS past the furlong mark but kept on inside and got up for a share of
the place. AKA LIONESS chased at the middle of a compact field early, pulled to engage outside the leader near the three quarters and prompted the pace,
switched inside of ISABIS past the five eighths after that foe floated out slightly, bid inside ISABIS just past the half and took a narrow lead into the turn, set
the pace while prompted by that foe around the bend, drove clear in upper stretch, was headed by NOFANSINTHESTANDS past the furlong pole, but was
still able to save a share of the place. BIRD KEY hopped slightly at the start, raced two wide in the rear pair on the clubhouse turn, pulled from near the
thirteen sixteenths, attended the leading flight four wide from near the three quarters, tracked outside down the backstretch, was pushed in the four path on
the turn to chase the leading pair after AKA LIONESS and ISABIS began to separate themselves into the bend, could not stave off the closers past the
three eighths, but chased on willingly under a drive in the lane to prove best of the rest. ISABIS took the lead outside of GIRLS COUNT near the seven
eighths, was engaged by several foes to her outside past the three quarters, inched almost a length clear near the middle of the backstretch but did not
clear the tracking flight, floated out slightly past the five eighths, was headed by AKA LIONESS to her inside past the half, prompted the pace two wide on
the bend, was driven to keep up past the three eighths, but proved no match in the lane and weakened. RULER DAENERYS raced keenly three wide on the
first turn, pulled to engage three wide outside the leader near the three fourths, tracked the pace until stopping at the half, faded in the three to four path on
the far turn and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
MORRISTON stumbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn,
began a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, pulled clear with a furlong to go and held that margin to the wire. NIP N TUCK raced off the pace on the inside
in the early going, began a bid while saving ground around the turn, and continued to improve position from the rail down the lane. WILL YA WIN SUM
trailed the field through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside late.
IRISH LIGHTED ROAD led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, drifted out mildly near the furlong
pole and tied between horses from there. LASTFORTINOFAMILY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back
while racing in the two and three path around the turn and continued to tire in the stretch.

Footnotes
HERO ALEXANDRA settled patiently at the rear, swung five wide for a bid on the far turn, continued to advance five wide in upper stretch, took the lead
from a reluctant BRUNELLA at the furlong marker, and kept on gamely to hold a narrow lead to the wire. BRUNELLA disputed the pace two wide through
the clubhouse turn, carried a narrow lead between horses down the backstretch, remained narrowly ahead of SIMPLY FAST and EYE ON THE FINISH to
her outside into the far turn, shook those foes off in the two path near the three eighths, dug in when confronted by HERO ALEXANDRA in upper stretch,
was headed at the eighth pole, fought on gamely inside that foe to the wire but could not wrest the lead back. ZANDREA'S chased behind the tracking flight
around the clubhouse turn, continued to chase outside of PRESENT OF HERO down the backstretch, bid five wide on the far turn, was driven in range
outside of WHITE LIES in upper stretch, proved no match for the leading pair in the final furlong but chased on best of the rest. WHITE LIES was fractious in
the gate, disputed the pace inside of BRUNELLA through the clubhouse turn, pressed the pace inside that foe to the five eighths, settled back to track
behind the leading line from there, chased while saving ground around the far turn, raced in range inside through upper stretch but flattened in the final
furlong. PRESENT OF HERO tracked the leading pair inside of EYE ON THE FINISH through the clubhouse turn, tracked behind the leading line down the
backstretch, chased three wide around the far turn, came in on EYE ON THE FINISH in upper stretch and ultimately did not have enough to be a threat in
the lane. EYE ON THE FINISH tracked the leading pair two wide through the clubhouse turn, advanced to press three wide down the backstretch, was
pushed along between horses in the leading flight into the far turn, proved no match for BRUNELLA from the three eighths while racing three wide, began to
weaken into the lane, was bumped by PRESENT OF HERO in upper stretch and was no further factor. SIMPLY FAST settled in second last through the
clubhouse turn, raced keenly two wide into the backstretch, pulled outside to join the leading flight past the eleven sixteenths, continued to attend four wide
to the three eighths, proved no match for BRUNELLA from there, stopped at the five sixteenths and was allowed to trail home.

Footnotes
ITS MY BAG BABY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid between horses approaching the three eighths pole,
entered the stretch in the three path, gained ground on the outside in upper stretch, and pulled clear in the final furlong. THE GRAY BLUR stalked the
leaders on the inside in the early going, raced in the two path around the turn and gained ground in late stretch. MISTER CHARMING raced off the pace on
the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, began a surging bid nearing the three sixteenths pole and gained ground
on the inside from there. CHANGE DIRECTION trailed the field on the inside in the opening stages, began to move up coming off the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn, raced into traffic and split horses with a furlong to go, and gained ground late. MR. ELEVENTH HOUR dueled for the lead on the
inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, continued to battle in upper stretch and weakened late. CLOUD TO GROUND dueled for the lead
on the outside early, dropped back to settle in behind the leaders around the turn, entered the stretch from the four path, made a mild gain on the outside in
upper stretch and flattened out in the final sixteenth. SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE dueled between horses up the backstretch, pushed ahead to a slight lead
from the two and three path around the turn and gave way in the final furlong. FIXICO chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, began to drop
back while racing in the three path around the turn and continued to fade from there. MAJESTIC JOHN'S trailed the field on the outside through the opening
quarter, raced in the three path around the turn while still at the back of the pack, and made no bid. TALIS PARK GRAD pressed the pace on the far outside
early, raced wide around the turn, entered the stretch in the five path and tired on the outside down the lane.
