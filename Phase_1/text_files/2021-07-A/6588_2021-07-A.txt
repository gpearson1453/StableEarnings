COWBOY COOL chased the early pace from between horses, then came three wide into the lane and tipped out four wide to make a bid to draw clear the
final sixteenth under left handed urging. COLONEL TOM chased the early pace from the inside, angled off the rail in the drive and rallied well for the place
award. OPTIMAL chased the early pace three wide and came into the drive five wide but lacked the needed bid while being along for the show award.
ROYAL BERTRANDO dueled for the lead on the inside then faded the final furlong. SIGUR ROS dueled for the lead and made a three wide bid on the turn
but weakened in the drive.

AWESOME SUNSET stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, was roused leaving the three sixteenths pole right handed,
then switched to left handed urging leaving the furlong marker, then slowly wore down the pace setter late to prove best. FRENCHIE FROU FROU set the
pace from the inside but was outfinished late while staying on gamely, clearly second best. CIAO CIAO was bumped at the start, then went up to stalk the
pace four wide on the backstretch and weakened, did come back on the inside in the stretch to best the rest. BLAME IT ON BREW chased the early pace
and was roused nearing the three eighths pole and tired. IZEONPOINT was four wide into the first turn, then moved over to the inside on the backstretch but
failed to respond.

Footnotes
PIXIE pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, drew clear in the stretch to prove best under mild urging. MY BABYS GONE was well
placed early on the inside, then eased out three wide leaving the quarter pole for clear aim on the front runners, but failed to gain on the winner despite
strong urging, second best with no apparent excuse. ADELE'S BLING dueled for the lead on the inside and faded the final furlong, bested rest.
BLUEGRASS DIXIE chased the early pace in between horses, then was four wide passed the quarter pole but had no punch in the drive.
SOUNDSLIKEAWINNER was allowed to settle early, swung out five wide for the drive but had no rally. OUTSMARTED chased the pace four wide and
weakened. ORENA STARSHINE failed to menace. CIBOLO SALLY dueled for the early lead in between horses and faltered.

clear passed the sixteenths pole but was caught late. LEMON DROP TINI was void of early speed, then advanced on the inside on the far turn, angled out
for racing room and rallied well late. XYLOPHONE was allowed to settle early while five wide own the backstretch, then was four wide on the turn and had a
mild late rally but needed more. GRAN MANNA set the pace from the inside and was headed nearing the quarter pole, fought gamely to late before fading.
FACE CARD CONTESSA was reserved early, then checked passed the three eighths pole, then came into the drive three wide and angled out in the drive
to have a belated rally. BLAME THE RED CAT checked and was rank early while keen on the first turn, finally settled into stride around the half mile marker,

Footnotes
OLD TRAFFORD was allowed to settle early and was three wide passed the quarter pole, then angled out nearing the furlong marker, closed on the outside
to get up in time. IZA DADDY was taken back early, then advanced three wide on the turn while in hand, swung out five wide to continue that bid, drifted in
once clear in the furlong grounds, hit the front late but was denied late to just miss. SINGANDCRYINDUBAI prompted the pace and made a three wide bid
entering the stretch to take over in the furlong grounds but faded late. WESTFEST chased the pace on the inside, angled out for racing room leaving the
furlong marker but needed more. THERUNAWAYROCKET set the pace on the inside and weakened the final furlong. FULL TRIGGER chased the early
pace five wide and made a four wide bid on the turn but faded in the drive while steadying in the furlong grounds. WHEN I DO was allowed to settle early
and made a mild five wide bid on the turn but had no late rally. HE'S A RANGER failed to menace. BLUE SKYE JADE chased the early pace in between
rivals then weakened. ALMA DERBY chased the early pace on the inside and weakened. THE JOCKEY ON THE #10 FULL TRIGGER CLAIMED FOUL
VERSUS THE #3 IZAQ DADDY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, THE STEWARDS REVIEWD THE REPLAYS AND LEFT THE
