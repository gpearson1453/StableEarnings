smartly but missed. SAINT'S REST raced in mid pack, chased along the rail and two-wide then angled out while closing through the stretch. SIR
GRAYVENSCROFT dueled early then forced the pace into the turn, chased three and four-wide to the stretch but evened out in the late stages. MR WILL
dueled on the backstretch, forced the issue on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely in vain. JU JITSU CAT was off slowly and settled in mid

Footnotes
MORE SAVVY raced in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide through the turn, rallied smartly and was up just in time, driving. CLASSY
N' SILENT was sent to the early lead and moved to the rail, set a pressured pace, moved clear late turn, widened upper stretch then finished all out to hold
but was caught on the wire. PENETANGUISHENE settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn and chased through the stretch. ASHA
IRONBORN stumbled leaving the gate and settled at the rear of the pack, was hustled along the rail and two-wide through the turn then finished gamely in
vain. LATER GATOR raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. MIAHSOLOMIAH moved up the rail to
challenge the leader but steadied behind that one when CLASSY N' SILENT moved to the wood, angled to the second path, forced the issue early turn,
chased into the stretch and flattened out.

BLIND TRUST stalked the pace, came three-wide through the turn, rallied gamely and was up in deep stretch, driving. DEALMAKER pulled hard to reach
the lead, set the pace and settled in mid turn, was lugging in through stretch and was passed nearing the wire. TALL WATER raced in mid pack along the
rail, rallied gamely until reaching the leader in the stretch, moved off the fence and rallied with good energy. DUNES OF NAMIBIA got away slowly and
settled in mid pack, angled from two to four-wide late turn then closed fast from the outside. SILENCIUM pressed the pace, was hustled two and three-wide
on the turn, chased into the stretch and evened out in the final 16th. SAILIN STREET raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide through the
turn but lacked a closing response. PAPA D broke in the air to the inside, closed to mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then tired in the
stretch.

Footnotes
FUN COOL chased the leaders while in the two path to the quarter pole, angled out turning for home and drove by the leader at the sixteenth pole, widening
in the final seventy yards. SASSYWITHATTITUDE stalked the leader throughout, bid in upper stretch and led at the eighth pole, lost the front at the
sixteenth pole to the winner but dug in gamely to hold the place position late. AMERICAN GAMBLE was off the pace down the backside, advanced while
three wide on the turn and continued to pick off rivals while laying in down the stretch, just failing to collar the place horse late while outside. ESSENTIAL
BELLA stumbled badly a few jumps out of the gate and dropped back, closed two to three wide on the turn, came out in the five path turning for home,
shifted inside the eventual show finisher by the eighth pole and couldn't match that one's late energy, settling for a minor award. PEARLBDANCING along
the rail and inside rivals in midpack early, dropped back through the turn, seemed to figure it out when angling off the rail in midstretch and proceeded to
close noticeably in the final sixteenth when outside. ERRATIQUE settled between rivals and off the pace down the backside and on the turn, never
menacing at any time. DIXIEWISH chased the leaders along the inside into upper stretch but faded from that point to the wire. INFINITE PASSION sat in
mid pack along the inside and rallied mildly to the furlong pole but levelled off from there to the finish. BIRD SAVVY sped to the lead, had the front until
upper stretch when on her wrong lead and running greenly, headed at the eighth pole and retreating through the field. BIRD SAVVY came back having bled.
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH hesitated at the break and broke in when she finally did come out, far behind throughout.

Footnotes
OUR FLASH DRIVE stalked the pace, closed late backstretch, lapped onto the leader early turn, bid mid turn, was clear into the stretch and held sway
under a hand ride. MUNNYFOR RO broke outward and settled off the pace, raced three-wide on the clubhouse turn, closed from the rail to three-wide on
the far turn, and finished under a determined drive. SWEET SOUPER SWEET rated in striking range, was hustled two and three-wide on th efar turn,
chased into the stretch and finished gamely in vain. CALIFORNIA LILY set the pace, was pressured on the far turn, yielded late turn, chased into the stretch
but evened out in the late stages. GOTE GO was off the early pace then closed to mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn, but did not
menace. DANGER settled off the pace, dropped back on the far turn, lacked a rally but crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
WAR MACHINE had the lead early, allowed a rival to open a clear lead into the first turn, chased down the backside and moved up to bid on the far turn,
engaged that pacesetter along with another rival to his outside turning for home, stubbornly held the front and won a head-bobbing finish with a perfect trip
runner up to his inside on the wire. SMALL TALK was bumped by a rival at the start and settle in the two path while in midpack, moved up gradually into a
perfect spot behind the trio of leaders turning for home, got over to the rail at the eighth pole when one of those three faltered and lost the head-bobbing
finish photo. MALIBU EDGE was two wide chasing early, advanced three wide outside the winner to bid nearing the top of the stretch, stayed on gamely but
was no match for the top pair, stalling in the final sixteenth but holding the show spot. GIANT WATERS carried four wide around the first turn while in
midpack, stayed wide throughout and advanced into range on the far turn, loomed up behind the leaders in the five path turning for home but levelled off in
the final seventy yards after the wide trip. ENCHANT ME was three wide into the first turn off the pace and got over to the inside coming out of that bend,
got a dream run up the rail to nestle in behind the leaders turning for home but couldn't sustain his bid and levelled off in the final sixteenth. FREE
SHIPPING trailed into the far turn, came into upper stretch in the two path and angled out for the final sixteenth, closing smartly from there to the wire.
OCELOT cleared off by open lengths into the first turn, set solid fractions to hold a big advantage but paid for it midway on the far turn, stalked and collared
by the winner turning for home, tiring and retreating in the stretch. JACK broke in and bumped a rival at the start, settled three wide in mid pack around the
turns and was nearing contention at the top of the lane but lugged in down the stretch and couldn't enter the picture. RED MERCURY sat along the rail in
midpack until drifting off the fence late on the backstretch, never hinting at any sustained bid.

Footnotes
LORENA led early, set a pressured pace from the rail, shook clear into the stretch and held under a steady drive. ASTROLOGICAL raced from off the pace,
closed three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and was all out but could not challenge. CURLIN'S CATCH settled off the pace, closed two and
three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied gamely outside. IL MALOCCHIO, also off the pace, came along the rail and two-wide through the
turn, chased three-wide into the stretch but finished evenly. BODACIOUS MISS stalked the pace while riding the rail, was still in touch at the top of the
stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE hit the gate leaving, stalked the pace, moved up to force the issue midway through the
turn, chased into the stretch but was through and faded. EL BAYERN pressed the pacesetter, dropped back on the turn and lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
MISS MARIE broke outward and settled off the pace, closed angling from the rail to four-wide on the turn, rallied outside and was up late under a drive.
EMMELINE led into the first turn, set a pressured pace, quickened midway through the far turn, shook clear into the stretch and finished all out but was
caught on the wire. CONFIDENT stalked the pace, chased hard on the far turn, moved off the fence in the final furlong and launched her bid but weakened
late. CARELESS HEIRESS forced the pace, was hustled hard to stay on the leader through the far turn, chased into the stretch and evened out in the final
furlong. ROMY raced in mid pack, closed through the far turn, chased hard into the stretch and tired. HEKLA'S AURA raced in mid pack, was hustled
three-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response. VIVID VIXEN raced in mid pack, dropped back early on the far turn, trailed home, crossed the wire
and walked off.
