Footnotes
FONZIE SCHEME moved up to be clear from between horses exiting the chute, showed the way up the backstretch by daylight, was given a breather
through the turn, drew out through the lane under a firm left handed crop. RUNNER broke back, moved closer on the outside through the turn, floated out
four wide into the lane, could do little with the winner through the lane, drew clear for the place. HICCUP chased the winner from the outset off the inside,
crept a bit closer while appearing to get out a bit late in the turn, lacked a further advance to finish up best of the rest. CLEVER PRINCE went one paced
throughout in lacking a closing response. I'M A FLASHY KID fell far back after the start, continued to lag turn, picked off a single tiring rival while never a
factor. POINT TO THE GREEN within striking distance in the early stages, was finished before a half, continued to fade through the stretch.

Footnotes
PRAY IDE SING narrowly showed the way along the inside, continued to show the way through the turn while saving ground, shook clear when straightened
for home, fully extended to hold that closest pursuer safe in the final strides. DIAMOND PALACE forwardly placed off the inside, moved closer to press the
winner through the turn, fell back off that one upper stretch, coming back to be rapidly getting back to that rival late, well clear of the others. COMBAT
COMMAND settled off the pace and the inside, three wide into the lane, proved no match for the top two in the drive, clear of the rest. ROUND QUARTER
pressured the winner early from off the inside, gradually weakened. FLASH ME BACK lacked early speed, three out to four wide in the turn, failed to rally. G
CISIVE squeezed back at the start, trailed throughout in showing little.

DRAKKAR stalked the two early leaders off the inside up the backstretch, advanced and challenged the sole pacesetter from the outside late in the turn,
dueled through upper stretch then kicked steadily clear under steady right handed urging. TACTICAL PRIORITY dueled early off the inside, briefly clear
when showing the way through early turn, responded when the winner came alongside late in the bend, second duel through upper stretch then could not
keep up, held second late. HALF OURS N STORMY outrun early after falling back after the start, saved some ground through the turn when remaining
back, steered to the outside for the drive, set down and closed willingly to be getting to the runner up. OUTLAW X. back off the early, one paced in the three
path turn, continued in even fashion through the lane in lacking a closing kick while remaining out in the course. SOUL SONG dueled early inside the runner
up, began a steady fade before a quarter. PALMY SUNDAE last away, trailed in lacking a closing response.

Footnotes
SIXTO off a step slow, trailed up the backstretch, moved closer into the turn, came three wide for the drive, rallied through traffic to be up in time. SAILING
JETT broke well, pressed the issue on the outside in the run up the backstretch, vied four wide turn, showed the way past the furlong marker, could not
contain the winner, gained the nod for the place at the wire. COMERUNNINBOYS broke back, lacked speed, four wide out of the turn, rallied while
remaining out in the strip to narrowly missed the second spot. CAN IF I CAN broke on top, set or forced the pace in the three path and between horses,
gradually weakened through the stretch. MR LEO lacked speed out in the strip, was five wide exiting the turn, improved position slightly past the furlong
marker, not a serious threat. BIG BOSS MAN with the early pace in the run up the backstretch inside, fell back through the turn when beginning to falter.
REPOSADO narrowly set the early pace while between horses, continued to contest the issue in the two path turn, gave way in the drive. GRIP TIGHT in
mid pack early, gave way in the stretch, jogged in late.

Footnotes
KING LIAM broke near the back, moved up into a forward position along the inside before a furlong, continued to save ground turn,slipped through along the
rail turning for home, took over and proved best under steady handling. CUSTOM DEELITE pressed the issue up the backstretch off the inside, vied
between horses through the turn, gave ground grudgingly through the stretch,h eld sway for the place late. OXBOW PIONEER broke back, continued to lack
speed through the turn, rallied toward the inside, getting to the runner up late. STARZIP brushed start, void of speed, continued to lag through the turn
toward the inside, moved out a bit for the drive, in tight between horses late when improving a bit. FIFTY PROTECTION within striking distance outside, four
wide when remaining in the second flight through the turn, lacked a significant closing punch. CARRY THY CROSS broke alertly, set the pace up the
backstretch toward the inside, continued to set the pace through the turn in the two path, allowed the winner the inside entering the straight then weakened
when headed by that one soon after. GOLDEN NOGUEZ remained back while racing four wide exiting the turn. QUEST FOR AVETTE a pace factor
outside, three to four wide when contesting the issue through the turn, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
MISS UNDERRATED away well, set or forced the early pace, garnered a larger advantage when straightened for home, found more to extend that
advantage a bit with a sixteenth to run, enough left to withstand the runner up in the final strides. BIND ME UP brushed, steadied at the start to trail out of
the chute, remained back while in the two path turn, shifted out for room past the furlong marker, closed well late to be getting to the runner up late.
RHETT'S RACER void of speed inside, continued to save ground when trailing through the turn, made a late run up the rail to annex the show spot. BACK
INTHAT ACTION brushed steadied at the start, raced in mid pack, remained in the second flight into the lane while three wide into the lane, lacked the
needed closing kick. LIL' SISTER LOU in the second flight early, ranged up to join the fray three wide into and through the turn, remained in contention past
the furlong marker, came up empty in the late going while between horses. FILM STUDY away well, dueled outside the winner up the backstretch,
continued to do battle while between rivals in the turn, weakened in the drive. SHE'S A FAIR CATCH off the pace while outside early, four wide through the
turn, tired in the drive.

BERTIE'S GALAXY took command just after the start, shook clear in hand turn, maintained a comfortable advantage through the lane under token
encouragement to win ridden out. WILD BERT broke with the field, fell back to trail, advanced to join the second flight while four wide turning for home,
failed to seriously threaten the winner late, dug in to earn the place. BLACK SWORD second flight along the inside, long drive for the place spot, outkicked.
LAUGHINGSAINTSSONG also in the second group, between rivals into the lane, lacked a closing response. C'MON VE broke on top, chased the winner for
a half and began to falter.

Footnotes
LUKES SECRET broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch just off the inside, clear in the two path turning for home, edged away further under
steady handling. MISS HURRYUPNWAIT chased the winner throughout off the inside, proved no match for that one in the final furlong, held the place late.
POINT OF VICTORY within striking distance early outside, came in with a half mile remaining resulting in CIRCLEOFSOUL clipping her heels and falling,
continued with contact of the leaders while three then two wide turn, moved back out a bit for the drive, gaining on MISS HURRYUPNWAIT in the final
strides. PERFECT PEACH forwardly placed in the early going, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response while remaining along the
inside. OUR LITTLE GIRL broke back, lacked speed, passed some faltering rivals while never a threat. IAM DAKOTA settled behind the early pace, had
nothing for the drive. CHARLIE SKY steadied at the start and again in the early going, stopped after a half, far back, jogged in. CIRCLEOFSOUL in the main
group early while between horses, clipped heels when POINT OF VICTORY came in with four furlongs remaining, fell and unseated her rider. FOLLOWING
A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN UP THE BACKSTRETCH, POINT OF VICTORY WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SEVENTH.
