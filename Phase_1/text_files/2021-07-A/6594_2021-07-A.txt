STORMING WARRIOR settled just off of the early pace, saved ground on the second turn, brushed CHARMING VINTAGE nearing the furlong marker while
quickly going by that rival and kicked clear in the end. CHARMING VINTAGE prompted the pace through the second turn, took the lead off of the second
turn, was collared by the winner and brushed that one as he quickly went by and was outfinished, while besting the rest. TWO PUNCH CAT broke on top
and set all of the pace through the second turn, gave up the lead heading into the lane and gave way in the stretch run. MASTER DIAMOND settled toward
the rear of the field, saved ground on the second turn while two wide and weakened in the stretch drive. WHISPERING FLAME was unhurried early, was
three wide on the second turn and lacked a rally in the stretch run. LUCKY LAGS chased the pace while four wide on the first turn, continued to track the

Footnotes
HARMON was bumped on the run into the first turn, sat just off of the early pace, was four wide on the second turn, pressured UNION DANCE off of the turn
and dug in in the final sixteenth to prevail. UNION DANCE prompted the pace by JAMMERS JUSTICE, was two wide on the second turn while gaining
ground on that one, led into the lane but tired in the final furlong and was caught, while saving the place. JAMMERS JUSTICE came over a path on the run
into the first turn, making MANILA MISCHIEF take up and bump HARMON, set the pace through the second turn, was confronted nearing the
three-sixteenths by UNION DANCE and was outkicked in the stretch run. MANILA MISCHIEF took up on the run into the first turn, settled toward the rear of
the field, was three wide on the second turn and finished evenly in the stretch drive. NOWHERE MAN was away slowly and was unhurried through the early
stages, was four wide on the second turn and trailed throughout. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN THE RUN TO
THE FIRST TURN, AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT #5 JAMMERS JUSTICE COST #4 MANILA MISCHIEF THE CHANCE AT A
BETTER PLACING AND DISQUALIFIED HIM FROM THIRD TO FOURTH. Due to a timer malfunction the mile time was omitted.

Footnotes
WARM SUMMER sat just off of the early pace of MUNN SHE'S PRETTY, slipped to the inside for the run on the turn, gained ground on the turn to take the
lead coming into the stretch and kicked clear in the end. GO SMILEY GO chased the pace into the turn while four wide, ran evenly in the stretch run and
was outfinished by the winner, while holding for second. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL settled in the midflight early, was four wide on the turn while gaining ground
and finished willingly in the stretch run to be a clear third. MUNN SHE'S PRETTY set the pace through the turn, was confronted nearing the top of the lane
by the winner and tired in the stretch drive. JEANNE B stalked the early pace while four wide, was outrun off of the turn and weakened in the stretch run.
SMILING SPIRIT settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the turn and lacked a rally in the stretch run. LIAM'S SECRET had no speed in the
early going, was three wide on the turn and was not a factor. CHIEFTAIN'S LADY was outrun in the early going, was five wide along the turn and trailed
throughout.
