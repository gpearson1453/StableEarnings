Footnotes
TUMAC MOUNTAIN was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, responded to steady urging and was up in the closing
yards. ROUGH RIDE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and yielded to the winner late.
MISO FAST was off a step slow then raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with good late energy.
COLAVITO was fractious at the gate, lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. MONSTRODAMOUS broke
sharply to chase the pace of ROUGH RIDE while racing four-wide and weakened through the final furlong. SALE' Y VALE chased the leaders while racing
three-wide for three furlongs and weakened.

HARD TO DENY dueled for the lead with STAND TO while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and held off the
closing NAVAL ESCORT to prevail. NAVAL ESCORT lagged early, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy. STAND TO
disputed the pace with the winner from the inside, gave way to that rival after going a half and stayed on well in the drive. TIME 'N TIME AGAIN lacked early
foot, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace. MY GRANDPA was off slow, moved up quickly for a contending position, raced four-wide
through the second turn and weakened in the drive.

DOWNTHEMIDDLE DAN was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by LIBERTY'S FINALE nearing the
half, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive and edged clear through the closing yards. LIBERTY'S FINALE pressed the pace of the winner while
racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the half, vied into deep stretch but could not match strides late. LITTLE BIG HOUSE was bumped at
the break, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. TOUGH ROOSTER was bumped at the start,
appeared hard to rate, lagged early, saved ground through the second turn and was not a factor. ZANOS raced four-wide through both turns, settled off the
leaders and failed to rally. SHADY DRIFTER was bumped at the start, chased the leaders while racing three-wide for a half and weakened.

HOLD ME CLOSE sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, increased that advantage into the second turn and drew off through the
lane as the easiest of winners.. POPPY'S C NOTE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, could not gain on the winner in the drive but was up for
the place. TRIUNFADOR chased the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive and gave way late for the place. STANLEY
RYDER was forwardly placed, raced three-wide through the second turn and weakened in the drive. AMANDA'S BEACH BOY lagged early, saved ground
through the second turn, angled out approaching the stretch and was not a factor. KING CHARLIE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the
second turn and did not menace.

LUCKENBACH was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, responded to steady urging and was up in the final yards.
LOOSE BALL lagged early, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled in and out in mid-stretch and finished willingly when clear. FREESTONE was
bumped at the break, chased the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin into
the lane and gave way through the final sixteenth. SPARKLING LUTE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. PREMIER
LEAGUE was bumped at the break, lacked early speed, steadied nearing the three-eighths pole, angled out and was not a factor. MARK MY WORD settled
off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and was not urged in the drive. HAYNESFIELD HIT was away in good order to set a pressured
pace from the inside and weakened after going three-quarters.

Footnotes
SHIFTY DANCER broke sharply to duel for the lead with EDDIE AND THE KING from the inside, vied with that rival into deep stretch, responded when
taken on by GUARDINGTHEMONEY late and gamely prevailed. GUARDINGTHEMONEY was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out into
the stretch and finished with a steady rally to be gaining late. EDDIE AND THE KING was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner while
racing three-wide and gave way through the final sixteenth. ON THE WINGS OF was off a step slow and bumped, lacked early foot, raced three-wide
through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with late interest. DESERT PROPHET was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide
through the second turn and weakened. JACKSON TELLER lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace. ONE TUFF
MINISTER was bumped at the start, lagged early, saved ground through the second turn and was not a factor. BERNIE was void of early foot, raced
four-wide through the second turn and did not threaten.
