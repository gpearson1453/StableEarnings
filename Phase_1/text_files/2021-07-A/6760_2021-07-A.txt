Footnotes
IT'S THE SUNRISE stalked the pacesetter into the backstretch, pressed into the far turn while in the two path, bid in mid-turn to quickly take over and clear,
widened into the lane then was all out when getting weary late. PALMER'S PASS was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the three path on the
far turn when improving position, came into the lane from the four path with momentum and was closing in to the wire. GO NUTS chased the pace from the
three path through the turns then weakened in the drive. ONE FOR THE MONEY was in the three path through the far turn when well back, moved up while
never a threat. ALIAS REX set the pace into the far turn then gave way readily. VICTOR'S MAJESTY was in the three path through the far turn when losing
ground, came into the lane from the four path and was eased to the wire and walked off. STRONG STYLE was in the two path through the turns, faltered
after straightening in the lane and slowed to a walk to the wire.
