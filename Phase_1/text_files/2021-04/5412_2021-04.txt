Footnotes
HAPPY INTEREST pressed SCIENCE from outside early, took over approaching the quarter-pole and widened under a drive. SCIENCE broke to the lead
and moved inside, was hounded for three furlongs by HAPPY INTEREST, could not cope with that one turning for hone, and ran on to hold the place.
LUCKYTOHAVEMYVICKI raced three wide with the leaders in sight on the turn, but could not gain through the stretch on her left lead. IDES OF MARCH
went along in range two then three wide around the turn, lugged in through upper stretch and wound up on the rail clearly best of the remainder.
CATIRUSIA was no factor three wide. WORKING OVERTIME broke a step slowly, and was outrun inside. WATER WIZARD broke poorly spotting the field
several lengths, put in a mild run between horses midway on the turn, but could not sustain it. BOCA GIRL was a step slow at the start, and showed little
inside. CASH UP FRONT raced widest early, and got out badly through the turn and into the stretch.

Footnotes
SIMPLIFY (ARG) rated up close two wide, took over near the seven-sixteenths pole, was soon confronted by ADDILYN who reached near even terms near
the five-sixteenths marker, vied inside of that foe to upper stretch, shook clear leaving the three-sixteenths pole and widened under a drive. ADDILYN
stumbled badly at the start, advanced inside down the backstretch, made a strong three wide move around the turn, reached near even terms outside of the
winner near the five-sixteenths pole, dueled to upper stretch, could not keep pace from there but stayed on to be a clear second. I'M A COCO PEBBLES
was reluctant to load, chased the pace four wide, lacked a rally and bested the rest. KERIK bumped with ROMANTICAL NOTE at the start, raced two and
three wide and never threatened. ROMANTICAL NOTE was bumped at the start and failed to menace while racing two and three wide. PITUFINA had early
speed three and four wide and was through after a half. GREENWOOD DRIVE vied inside the winner for half and retreated.

Footnotes
KAY'S PROJECT was unhurried early inside, swung out four wide getting in gear past the quarter-pole, collared MAMA LONGLEGS from outside entering
the final furlong and drew off. MAMA LONGLEGS set the pace inside, proved no match for the winner past the eighth-pole but ran on to hold the place.
CHISPITA tried several different paths through the run around the turn, came three wide into the lane and was along late for the show outside rivals.
HASHTAG LUCKY vied early outside MAMA LONGLEGS, moved inside getting shuffled back around the turn, and weakened late while drifting out. JULIE
BIRD (IRE) raced three wide around the turn, lacked the needed response in the stretch, and was cautiously handled as HASHTAG LUCKY came her way
near the finish. COCOTARA was forwardly placed three then two wide to the quarter-pole, and tired in the stretch. DARN TOOTIN shied out from CHISPITA
just after the break, and trailed near the two-path.

LIZA STAR set the pace along the rail, drew off around the turn and held clear under a steady drive. FREE TO FLY chased the winner three wide, drifted
wider in upper stretch and was gaining late without seriously threatening. SUBSIDIARY raced closest to the winner two wide to upper stretch and lacked a
rally. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL saved ground and failed to menace. WEDONTBELIEVEHER played no factor while racing four wide. THE GREAT KATH had
brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
HANA LIMA (GB) settled in midpack early two wide, shifted out to the three-path advancing after six furlongs, swept to the front outside STONE TOWN and
STARSHIP NTERPRISE in upper stretch and drew off under a mild drive. STARSHIP NTERPRISE raced close up in the two-path from the outset, was
under a drive between horses outside the quarter-pole, could not kick on with the winner but held for the runner-up spot. DOUBLE CHOCOLATE broke
slowly and trailed early inside, went four wide around the far turn, and rallied mildly to get up for the show. BLUE TWIRLIN led early inside STARSHIP
NTERPRISE and STONE TOWN, relinquished command to the latter soon after completing a quarter-mile, followed along continuing to save ground to the
far turn, and had no response when roused. SWEET MISSION was slow to begin, lagged well back to the far turn, steadied on the rail approaching the top
of the stretch, moved out into the lane and went by tired horses. MINGLEWOOD (GB) raced three wide and well off the pace to the far turn, moved in a path
and bumped with CHECK TWICE leaving the quarter-pole, and tired. STONE TOWN contested the early pace outside rivals, moved in clearing to the lead
entering the backstretch, and stayed on to upper stretch before giving way. CHECK TWICE raced three wide, bumped with MINGLEWOOD late on the far
turn, and tired.

PRO QUALITY was a step slow to begin but recovered quickly, set a pressured pace inside rivals for six furlongs, shook clear into the stretch and held sway
under pressure. SCAR forced the pace three wide, could not stay with the winner turning for home, and ran on clear of the rest on his left lead.
WANDERING WEST was a step slow at the start but stayed close exiting the chute, shifted out four wide with clear sailing past the quarter-pole, and
finished evenly outside. TONALISM pressed the pace from the start, battled between horses around the turn, and gave way into the stretch while staying on
his left lead. DANVILLE raced two to three wide, and tired after six furlongs. NIXON JOY (ARG) showed early speed inside, and tired around the turn. THIS
RACE WAS HAND TIMED, SEVEN-FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

SMILE BRYAN stalked the pace two wide in the clear, took over in upper stretch, drew clear in midstretch and held clear under a drive. POSITIVE PHIL
checked entering the first turn, raced well back inside, weaved between rivals around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and kicked in nicely to narrow
much of the gap. GUACO raced well back two and three wide and rallied outside for the show. BEACH TRAFFIC chased the pace three wide around the
first turn and two wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. SEA TRIDENT set a fast pace inside and tired in the drive. WISE TO LISTEN
steadied into the first turn, raced two wide and never threatened. BIG MAN BOB chased the pace inside and faded in the drive. MEMORABLE was outrun
inside. BEINFUN saved ground and made little impact.

Footnotes
COMPENSATE advanced to contention around the turn four wide, caught CRUMB BUN from outside through the furlong grounds, drifted out a bit late and
dug in for a hard-fought decision. SONAR was two to three wide and in range through the opening half-mile, tipped widest near the eighth-pole, finished
gamely outside the winner but could not get past. CRUMB BUN hustled up after the start, vied inside rivals to upper stretch, yielded to COMPENSATE
coming to the furlong marker, and had just enough to salvage the show. SOUND MACHINE saved ground outsprinted to midway on the turn, lacked room
along the rail past the quarter-pole and into upper stretch, came clear into the last eighth of a mile but could only muster an even finish. VICTORY
CRUSADE was outrun inside to the stretch, moved out and made no appreciable headway. LENZI'S LUCKY LADY pressed the early pace outside, reached
a short lead around the turn three then two wide, but faltered between horses in upper stretch. DANCE D'ORO showed early speed two wide, and retreated
before completing a half.

Footnotes
VIKING PLUNDER settled in midpack inside, angled out to bid three wide midway around the far turn, seized command in upper stretch, vied past the
eighth pole and drove clear. FEAR THE DEER was in range two wide, bid three deep into the far turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, came in
slightly soon after and pushed WARP SPEED BABY into LIGHTNING ROD CARL, was collared by the winner in upper stretch, resisted inside of that foe
past the eighth pole and yielded late. FARM STRONG raced off the pace three wide, went four wide around the far turn and had a mild rally for the show.
TONE FEELIN hesitated at the start, lagged well back inside, made progress two wide around the far turn, reached contention inside a foe near the eighth
pole but flattened out a bit and just missed third. WARP SPEED BABY stalked the pace inside, bid two wide between foes entering the far turn, briefly led
between midway around the bend, was pushed in and checked leaving the five-sixteenths pole and had no further bids. CHANNELING was hard sent from
the gate, prompted the pace two wide and was through after a half. YANKEE BATBOY played no factor while racing three and four wide. LIGHTNING ROD
CARL set the pace along the rail, was collared nearing the five-sixteenths pole then was bumped and shut off soon after and retreated inside. BRYTON'S D
J was outrun inside. BALTIMORE JACK was outrun while racing two and three wide. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER
OF WARP SPEED BABY, FEAR THE DEAR WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FIFTH FOR INTERFERENCE AROUND THE FAR
TURN.
