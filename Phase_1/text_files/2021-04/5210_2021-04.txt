EBO SPECIAL reluctant to load, was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the turn, split rivals at the eighth pole,
responded willingly when clear, surged late and was just up for win. OUR SWEET GIRL chased three wide, bid on the turn, took over entering the stretch,
drew clear, dug in gamely and was nailed on the wire. B B'S ROCKET chased between rivals, rallied four wide into the lane, bid in upper stretch and then
flattened out. STONEHARBOR BLONDE chased inside, rode the rail into the stretch and lacked a rally. SWEET SAMURAI was bumped at the start, raced
two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. EMPRESS IRENE was fractious in the gate, set the pace on the inside, dueled with OUR SWEET GIRL
passing the quarter pole and tired. FEYRE stumbled badly at the start, raced three wide off the pace and was outrun.

on for the place spot. RULES away alertly, set the pace, dueled midway on the turn, dug in gamely between rivals in the stretch drive and just missed for
second. INDIRECTLY raced off the pace inside, chased between rivals on the turn, came three wide into the lane and finished evenly. JUST ENOUGH
raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, failed to rally in the lane. BRIDLECREST was outrun early on the inside, then did not factor.
GAME CHANGER was outrun.

RIVER SONATA pressed the pace racing outside of PASSPORT REQUIRED, bid on the far turn, took charge, responded when asked, quickly sprinted
away under energetic handling and was ridden out. PASSPORT REQUIRED set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the far turn, was no
match, then dug in gamely to save the place spot. GO METRO GIRL raced off the pace, advanced on the far turn, went three wide past the quarter pole,
then rallied mildly outside in the stretch. TAYLOR'S BELLE stalked close up between rivals, continued two wide, chased on the far turn and lacked a rally.
SUPERGIRL POWER tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. VALERIE FIRST raced four wide early, then chased four wide and
faded. FREE COFFEE chased three wide and gave way. GEORGIA BONNET was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside and outrun.

inside then rallied well to gain the place. ROYALTY SALVATORE was well placed pursuing the dueling leaders, angled wide in the stretch and continued
willingly. MORE THAN STRIKING broke alertly and vied three wide to midway on the turn and faded. FORMAN THE FOREMAN dueled between rivals
early, two wide on the turn and was empty in the stretch. FORT ROYAL dropped far behind outside and was never in contention. TACTICAL PURSUIT
(IRE) trailed to the stretch then passed a fading rival. HUYA lacked speed and gave way readily.
