FAIRCHILD chased the pace early on, was on the inside into the lane, made a bid down the lane, under a long drive while between horses and prevailed in
the final stages. TRACY FLICK chased the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane, veered out and bumped ROSALITA hard, straightened out and was
under a long drive to the wire but just missed. TAYET stalked the pace early on along the inside, stayed on the rail into the lane, drew clear near the eighth
pole but was ran down in the final stages. NAKED ON THE BEACH was bumped at the start, lacked any running room along the far turn, was in the three
path into the lane, rallied down the lane, was cut off and had to alter late but continued to gain in the final stages. MAGIC RIDE raced back early on, was off
the rail into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. ROSALITA trailed the field early on, split horses while under a rally nearing the lane, was in the three
path into the lane, continued the rally but was bumped hard by TRACY FLICK and leveled off late in the drive. SEMBLE JUSTE (IRE) raced midpack early
on, was in the four path into the lane, raced widest in the stretch, was bothered and had no late gain. DEAREST KITTEN came out and was bumped at the
start, set the pace early on while two wide, was on the inside into the lane and gave way down the lane. EIDA'S STORM pressed the pace early from the
inside, was in tight into the lane and folded up down the lane. THE RIDER OF ROSALITA CLAIMED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF TRACY
FLICK FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH AND AFTER REVIEW BY THE STEWARDS, TRACY FLICK WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED
SEVENTH FOR THE INFRACTION.

CONVECTION prompted the pace two wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, kicked away from the field at the three sixteenths pole, and kept to his task to
the wire. SCREENPLAY chased along the inside, slipped through a rail opening passing the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with an outer rival at the
three sixteenths pole, then kept on well to secure place. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE lied far off of the pace along the inside early on, but pulled while being
hard to handle at the nine sixteenths pole, came out on SPEIGHT AND MALICE passing that marker, inched closer turning for home while shifting to the
three path, found traffic behind rivals in upper stretch, altered a path outwards while between horses at the three sixteenths pole, but hung on his left lead
and needed correction from lugging in, then straightened and edged show approaching the wire. SOUTHERN WILL tracked from midpack four wide around
the turn, and chased the leaders home while failing to threaten. ORB OF THE BORO tracked from midpack three wide, inched closer to striking range
turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner in upper stretch, and tired late. SPONSORED lied at the rear of the field in the four path
around the turn, and improved without menacing. BREEZY MONEY got caught in the five path around the turn while off of the pace, and faded. MR.
THUNDERSTRUCK brushed the gate then bumped with JOHN EDWARD soon after the start, saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. SPEIGHT
AND MALICE lied far off of the pace early on, shied mildly when MARVELOUSMOONDANCE got rank at the nine sixteenths grounds, took the turn in the
three path and never got involved. BOURRE' TRICK lied far off of the pace in the two path around the turn, and never got involved. ALL THE DIAMONDS
set the pace along the inside, but weakened between horses in upper stretch, and stopped. JOHN EDWARD bumped with MR THUNDERSTRUCK soon
after the start, trailed early on, was pulled up into the turn, unmounted and unsaddled almost at the five sixteenths pole, and was vanned off from there.

Footnotes
GLYNN COUNTY lied off of the pace along the inside, tracked while shifting to the three path around the far turn, rallied behind the leaders in upper stretch,
split foes at the furlong pole, and surged clear. STARTING OVER settled at the rear of the field along the inside after checking mildly in the early part of the
first turn, took the far turn in the two path while inching closer, rallied behind the leaders to split foes two wide passing the furlong pole, but was outkicked by
an outer bidding rival, then just held place. BUY ME CANDY tracked from midpack along the inside, stalked the clear leader three wide and outside of foes
around the far turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch to stay outside of those rivals, but was outkicked by an inner foe at the furlong grounds, stayed
on in the late stages with a good kick, but missed reaching STARTING OVER for place. BEACHWALKER lied forwardly placed along the inside, stalked the
clear clear leader two wide around the far turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane to stay outside of that foe, produced a bid between horses
approaching the furlong pole, but was outkicked by an inner rival passing that marker, and chased him home. EL AHIJADO stalked along the inside,
produced a rail bid in midstretch, but was outkicked by multiple outer foes, and faded late. READY SOUL tracked from midpack two wide, then from the
three to four path around the far turn, tipped to the six path at the three sixteenths pole, but lacked a kick, and leveled off. BLANKET OF ROSES trailed
along the inside, saved ground around the far turn before shifting to the five path in midstretch, then split foes late while improving. JUULSTONE switched
outside of EL AHIJADO early on, moved forward to engage that foe crossing the wire for the first time, but tugged to open up into the first turn, widened his
advantage down the backstretch, but began to tire into the far turn, held a clear margin while drifting to the three path at the quarter pole, but was swallowed
up between horses at the furlong grounds. CIBOLIAN lied off of the pace two wide around both turns, and failed to get involved. CARMEL BAY lied off of the
pace three to five wide around the turns, and was done early.

Footnotes
CLUB CAR trailed the short field while tracking the pace from the two path around the turn, smoothly shifted five wide entering the lane to set up shop
outside of the group, swept past them approaching the furlong pole, and widened under mild hand urging. PALACE AVENGER set the pace along the
inside, shifted off of the rail entering the lane while meeting a pair of bids, but offered little resistance to a wider surging rival approaching the furlong pole,
then dug in to hold place thereafter. CALL ON MISCHIEF stalked while close up to the pace along the inside, but lacked a kick through a rail opening in
upper stretch, chased outer foes home, then just prevailed over AINT NO ELMERS for show. AIN'T NO ELMERS stalked three wide, inched closer turning
for home to bid for the lead at the quarter pole while being floated four wide, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole, then kept on to
miss show. ANNA'S FAST prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, but gave way between horses in upper stretch after being floated three wide.

Footnotes
MISCHEVIOUS MEL stalked along the inside, slipped inside of foes to make a rail bid for the lead in upper stretch, scooted clear at the furlong pole, and
drew off thereafter. MY SWEET STORY saved ground at the rear of the field, rallied along the rail through the lane, surged inside of a trio of rivals in the
final sixteenth, and reached place approaching the wire. BITTEN BY KITTEN dropped the rider in the post parade, but did not run off and was remounted
without incident, vied inside early on, came out and bumped BLACK SAND (GB) into the first turn, moved forward to set the pace along the inside around
that bend, showed the way around the far turn inside of a pair of foes, but shifted off of the rail entering the lane, got headed by an inside bidding foe in
upper stretch, dug in for place thereafter, but gave way approaching the wire. BLACK SAND (GB) vied outside of BITTEN BY KITTEN early on, but was
wrangled back to stalk crossing the wire for the first time before being bumped by that foe approaching the seven furlong pole, settled in a two wide stalking
position behind the pace and from between horses, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and offered a late kick, but missed reaching place on the wire.
ROBIN'S FANTASY lied forwardly placed while caught four wide into the first turn, tucked to a three wide stalking position around that bend, prompted the
pace three wide around the far turn, but was outkicked by an inner foe at the furlong pole, chased from between horses thereafter, but was outfinished by
minor rewards late. THE GINGER QUEEN (IRE) lied off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, gained ground four wide around the far turn to bid
in upper stretch, but flattened out through the final furlong. PICASSO COLLECTION lied at the rear of the field two wide, took the far turn four wide before
swinging six wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally. DANCEFORTHEEMPIRE got fractious waiting for the gates to open, tracked from midpack in the two
path, and never got involved. JAWHARA lied far off of the pace three wide, got caught in the five path around the far turn, and never got involved. DALIDA
shied from BLACK SAND (GB) into the first turn while achieving forward position, pressed the pace three to two wide, vied between horses around the far
turn, but weakened in upper stretch.
