nearing the quarter pole while moving, was carried out entering the stretch and drew clear through the final sixteenth. COURTING JENNY wasn't far back
while outside the winner, edged out into the four path while moving on the turn, was carried wide into the stretch while taking over but couldn't keep up late.
STORMY SPELL showed speed outside, took over early on the turn, ran out while inside the top two entering the stretch and faded. ALL ABOUT REYANA

Footnotes
NEARLY MISSED began a run between rivals before a half, moved to vie in the three path on the final turn, took over entering the stretch and drew out
under urging. GIZMO'S PRINCESS ducked out into JANE leaving the gate, moved to a short lead from the outside before a quarter, stayed out from the rail
once clear early on the backstretch and couldn't match the winner in the lane. FOXY HIYA stayed outside early, raced the two path around the final turn,
angled outside entering the stretch and gained slowly. MUSICAL TIMES lagged early, improved position two wide around the final turn but failed to sustain
her bid through the lane. JANE was bumped leaving the gate, raced wide into the first turn and failed to be a factor. ARCTICA showed speed in the two path
for about five furlongs, stopped and was eased up through the lane.
