Footnotes
P JS SILVER DUKE was bumped then fell back leaving the gate, began a run along the rail after a half, steadied when blocked behind horses early on the
final turn, got clear entering the stretch then rallied to the front late. HERE'S WALDO took command at once, stayed close to the inside, ran out entering the
stretch, bumped with BLUEBERRY MASH past midstretch, faltered and finished in a dead heat for second. BLUEBERRY MASH chased the early leader
two wide, bumped with that one while dueling in midstretch and finished even for the place. PENSAMIENTO ducked out into the winner leaving the gate,
trailed while wide into the stretch then passed tired ones. TRENDING UP was no factor in an even effort. DOLLARIZATION tired two wide.

APRILNESS opened a clear lead soon after the break, fell back along the rail early on the turn, ran clear in early stretch and widened under urging.
UNOQUATROSIETE lagged into the stretch then closed outside for the place. RUN THE BLUES AWAY raced four wide with the pace into the turn,
remained prominent into the final furlong then weakened. MISS PARFAIT raced the two path in an even effort. SOUTH HOUSE was bumped around
between rivals leaving the gate, was sent early to duel then tired. BRONX CHERIE ducked out, bumped SOUTH HOUSE leaving the gate, moved to a short
lead between rivals before a quarter, raced two wide into the turn then tired. ROYAL ATHENA bobbled then was bumped leaving the gate, advanced
outside, was wide around the turn, stopped and was eased up.
