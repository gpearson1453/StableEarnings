Footnotes
COPPER CROSSING broke slightly inward, settled to track behind the leading trio, saved ground in range through the turn, was driven for an inside bid into
the lane, was put in tight near the three sixteenths when HATCHET CREEK came in, nonetheless sustained his rally, headed that foe near the furlong mark,
and drove clear. HATCHET CREEK was sent for speed, set the pace down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was confronted by HE HAS NO
FRIENDS and COLIDA to his outside nearing the five sixteenths, shook them off into the lane, put COPPER CROSSING in tight when he came in near the
three sixteenths, was headed by that foe near the furlong pole, weakened but had enough to salvage second. COWBOY HIPPIE settled at the rear, was
pushed along in the five path on the turn, continued five wide into upper stretch and went to a drive, kept on outside but missed the place. COLIDA tracked
the pace three deep down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, began his bid on the pacesetter near the three eighths, loomed near the five
sixteenths, was driven into the lane four wide, but was shaken off by HATCHET CREEK past the quarter and weakened. HE HAS NO FRIENDS tracked the
pace between horses down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, bid between horses near the three eighths, began to flatten out near the five
sixteenths, and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
Z U SOON was hustled to the early lead in the two path around the first turn, continued to show the way from the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and continued to extend his margin to the wire. DUCHOSSOIS raced in the three path around the first turn,
pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole, dueled in upper stretch, gave way with a
furlong to go and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. TORNADO BOY chased the leader while saving ground around the first turn, dropped back
slightly to settle in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a mild bid from the rail nearing the three eighths pole, and could not go with
the top two while finishing evenly. BORA BORA saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
from the two and three path and was outkicked from there. MR. MUTADDA raced between horses in the two path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch at the back of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and made no bid.

Footnotes
TWO COOKIE RULE prompted the pace outside of MAGA COUNTRY early, settled back slightly down the backstretch to track three wide, encroached two
wide on the far turn, headed the leader near the five sixteenths, held a narrow lead three wide through upper stretch, came out slightly midstretch, drove
clear past the furlong mark as MAGA COUNTRY began to weaken, drifted in slightly late and held off COCKALORUM. the latter settled in second last,
improved three wide on the far turn, was driven three and then four wide in the lane, found his best in the final furlong, and was gaining late. FLASHY
RICHIE raced outside of FINAL CALL in the tracking flight through the clubhouse turn, tracked the leader between horses down the backstretch, was
pushed along between horses on the far turn and driven between into the lane, altered slightly out midstretch when a hole between TWO COOKIE RULE
and MAGA COUNTRY closed, kept on evenly under a drive, and was taken up by his rider late when TWO COOKIE RULE drifted in while clear in front.
MAGA COUNTRY set the pace, took some pressure from TWO COOKIE RULE outside him through the first turn, edged clear for the backstretch run, was
confronted by TWO COOKIE RULE while racing in the two path on the far turn, was headed near the five sixteenths, dug in and vied inside that foe to the
the sixteenth, and weakened inside late. FINAL CALL tracked inside behind MAGA COUNTRY, was pushed along while continuing to save ground around
the far turn, went to a drive inside in upper stretch, and emptied out from the three sixteenths. YOUJUSTGOTTUPPERED soon trailed, lost further position
into the far turn, was pushed along while saving ground around the far turn, came into the lane in the three to four path, offered no rally and was not
persevered with late. THE JOCKEY OF FLASHY RICHIE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF TWO COOKIE RULE, ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN. AFTER REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

MORA VALLEY led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled for the lead while saving ground around the turn, opened up with a furlong to go and
dug in gamely in late stretch to hold off the late closers. REJOICE AN BE GLAD hit the gate leaving it, raced in the middle of the pack between horses
through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, swung wide while launching a bid entering the stretch and gained ground steadily
down the lane, just missing. KENAI COOL raced at the back of the pack early, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the three
sixteenths pole and gained ground quickly on the outside in late stretch. COUNTRY ASSETS raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and was outkicked in the stretch. ANGEL'S RUN trailed the field on the inside early, saved ground around
the turn, improved position mildly in upper stretch and then weakened late. TAPIGAL pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to
challenge and then dueled from the two path around the turn, and tired between horses in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SAY CHEESE broke in and bumped RUBY ROUND HERE in the opening strides, chased three wide down the backstretch, was pushed along three wide
into the turn to stay in range of the leading pair, tracked them in the four path around the bend, sustained her pursuit three wide into upper stretch, reeled in
the leader past the furlong mark and cleared. LADY MAGNA settled in second last down the backstretch, continued patiently in the two path on the turn,
went to a drive inside in upper stretch and responded with a bid, was taken two wide near the furlong mark, continued to rally, and got up for place late.
RUBY ROUND HERE was bumped between horses in the opening strides, tracked outside the pacesetter down the backstretch, began to encroach in
earnest while racing in the three to four path from near the seven sixteenths, took a narrow lead with three eighths of a mile remaining, was briefly clear near
the three sixteenths when BOBBIE TOO TOO began to weaken, was soon afterward engaged by SAY CHEESE, lost the lead to that foe past the furlong
mark, flattened out and lost place late. I JUANA HERO broke slightly outward and bumped RUBY ROUND HERE, chased between horses down the
backstretch, continued midpack two wide on the turn and three wide into upper stretch, and kept on evenly down the lane. BOBBIE TOO TOO was bumped
by EADS BRIDGE in the opening strides, nevertheless shook to the lead from the five eighths, was confronted by RUBY ROUND HERE near the seven
sixteenths and headed by that foe near the three eighths, fought on inside that foe to the top of the stretch but weakened in the final three sixteenths. EADS
BRIDGE broke out and bumped BOBBIE TOO TOO in the opening strides but was nonetheless away sharply, settled back inside past the five eighths,
chased while saving ground around the turn, was driven between horses in upper stretch but came up empty. DONTOUCHTHATDIAL soon trailed, was
pushed along into the turn, took closer order in the four path, came up empty from the quarter and drifted out midstretch.

MARK OF THE Z bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead from the two path up the backstretch and around the
turn, pulled clear with a furlong to go and was kept to the task to the wire, holding off a late closer. BORDINI trailed the field on the inside in the early going,
raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, began a bid near the quarter pole, and gained ground quickly on the outside down
the lane. NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) stumbled and bumped slightly with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, dueled for the lead on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn, continued to vie for the lead in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. JUST BLAZE raced off the pace
on the outside early, began a bid from the three path approaching the three eighths pole, and was outkicked from there. ONE WAY HOME raced at the back
of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. DEMAND RANSOM raced in the
middle of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and faded in the stretch. GREAT GRET chased the leaders up
the backstretch, raced between horses in the three path around the turn and tired badly in the stretch.

I'M CORFU came in and bumped THE TABULATOR in the opening strides, was sent for speed, set the pace while prompted by STRONG WILL down the
backstretch and while racing in the two path on the turn, shook off STRONG WILL past the quarter pole, went to a drive late and held sway. COLONEL
KLINK tossed his head when unprepared at the start, soon trailed, saved ground on the far turn, began to take closer order from near the three eighths,
regained touch with the field when rallying inside in upper stretch, stayed on with willingly inside to the wire but was held at bay by the winner. THE
TABULATOR was bumped by I'M CORFU in the opening strides, settled in second last, chased in the five to six path on the turn, was pushed along past the
three eighths and began to rally, kept on under a drive five wide in upper stretch, and evened out in the final furlong. OIL MONEY tracked behind the leading
pair down the backstretch and in the four to five path on the turn, came into the lane four wide, lacked the needed response when driven and flattened out.
STRONG WILL prompted outside of I'M CORFU down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, was driven into the lane but could not keep pace
with that leader and faltered from upper stretch.

Footnotes
MARESONOFAGUN raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far
turn in the three path, began a bid near the five sixteenths pole, gained ground between horses and pulled clear in the final sixteenth of a mile. COSMIC
TREASURE pressed the pace from the two path through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn still in the two path, took over entering the
stretch, was caught with a sixteenth of a mile to go and drifted out to the wire, swerving significantly in the final strides. DEJOHN raced in the three path
around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, began to improve position from the three path around the far turn, and continued to
gain mildly down the lane, while proving to be no match for the top two. IMPERIAL TEMPLE saved ground around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far turn from the two path and finished evenly. IRISH TUFF was fractious and dumped his
rider behind the gate, broke well and raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the
backstretch, came around the far turn in the four path, entered the stretch in striking position and weakened in the final furlong. DOES NOT STOP saved
ground while trailing the field around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to race on the inside around the far turn and made no bid. SMART
TRIAL led the field while saving ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the second turn and tired badly in the
stretch. INDIANA RED raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, began to drop back
while racing in the two path headed into the far turn, continued to tire from there and was eased to the wire.
