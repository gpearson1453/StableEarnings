Footnotes
GRIMGRINNIN' GHOST was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead
and held sway to the wire. ST JOE VIPER was away alertly to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by RELISHMENT
nearing the quarter, could not match strides with the winner late but finished with good courage. RELISHMENT pressed the pace of ST JOE VIPER while
racing four-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing the quarter and failed to sustain his rally. LEGACY AZTECA appeared hard to rate, raced off the rail
through the second turn and finished evenly late. KALEIDOSCOPE KID was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the second turn and lacked the
needed rally. GRAY BEAU raced four-wide through the second turn and lagged throughout.

Footnotes
SOAKING WET showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the sixteenth pole and was up late. BRIDGEKEEPER
set a pressured pace from off the rail, drifted in slightly nearing the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly to the winner. REINER lacked early foot, saved
ground through the second turn, angled out and in with a furlong to run and finished with good energy when clear. POSEIDONS MYTH was reserved just off
the leaders early, raced in tight quarters nearing the sixteenth pole and failed to gain late. MAGIC BOMB hopped at the start and was bumped, settled off
the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. ABUELO NUNO raced off the
pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. SMILES OF JOY pressed the pace while
racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. THE WILD FLYER raced off the leaders early from the inside, raced in tight quarters with a furlong
to run and was not urged late. BIG SNITCH was bumped at the break, raced four-wide through both turns while being forwardly placed and weakened in the
drive. PACIFIC LEGEND lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn and was eased through the lane. THE RIDER OF THE WILD FLYER
LODGED AND OBJECTION AGAINST BRIDGEKEEPER CONCERING THE RACING IN TIGHT QUARTERS NEARING MID-STRETCH AND AFTER
REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

in nearing the sixteenth pole and was up in the closing yards. YES IT'S FREE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into
the stretch and finished with a steady bid. SIP'N DIP pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied and gave
way late. ELLIE BE DANCING set a pressured pace, responded when challenged nearing the quarter, vied and gave way. MY DIRTY MARTINI broke out,
raced just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. KOZY VILLAGE lacked early foot, raced four-wide
through the turn, angled out into the stretch and failed to menace. PRETTY PRINCESS was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was
not a factor. CRYSTAL SKY was bumped at the break and was lagged throughout.

DIGNA chased the winner while racing five-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but finished well to be second best. MI TIA CHRISTINA threw her
head at the start, raced just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. REINA LA KELSY raced
unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly late. ALEXBABE lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and failed to menace. MAMBO DANCER showed brief speed and
weakened. ANNIE UP BUCK was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
A COTSWOLD VILLAGE broke sharply to duel for the early advantage with SMART SOLDIER, vied with that rival into deep stretch and drew clear late.
POMPEY'S RULE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good late
energy. SMART SOLDIER disputed the pace from off the rail with the winner, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive and gave way late. SWIPE LEFT
lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. YITO MACHINE was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved
three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly late. DISTINCTIVE ECHO lacked early foot, raced four-wide trough the
turn and was not a factor. ALVARADO settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. WOLFPUB showed no
early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not threaten. CLEAR WONDER showed brief speed and weakened.

four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. JOYOUS FAIRY TALE chased the leaders from the inside for a half and weakened. LEDGER chased the

Footnotes
AMERICAN OF COURSE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, responded when challenged by CHILLIN LADY into the lane and
drew off as a handy winner. CHILLIN LADY was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths pole, was
no match to the winner in the drive but clearly second best. RACHEL'S WISH chased the winner while racing four-wide and gradually gave way. V K
PRINCESS settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. DARESCA showed no early speed, raced
three-wide though the turn and failed to threaten. STARSHIP PRANKSTER raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked
the needed rally. PATRICIA H was bumped at the start, raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ENOUGH
KISSES lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. QUEEN ASHY BABY was void of early speed, saved ground through the
turn and did not reach contention. MY OWN PASSION was off a step slow and bumped, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. MARION'S
DELIGHT lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not threaten. FIDDLERSHOTPLEASUR was bumped at the break, showed brief
speed and weakened.
