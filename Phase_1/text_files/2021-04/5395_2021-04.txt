Footnotes
VINTAGE VINNIE (IRE) vaulted to the lead from the start and had a substantial lead by the time he jumped the first fence, and he extended that lead
through out the race making a few mistakes along the way and there was no horse in sight when he reached the wire. PRESELI ROCK (IRE) raced mid
pack for most of the race but still in striking distance for second, rallied after the road going to the last and prevailed for the second spot. ROCKET STAR
RED raced close to the lead of the second group, got in contention over the last two fences and dueled with PRESELI ROCK (IRE) through the stretch but
gave way in the final strides. ROYAL RUSE (s) rated in the back until the backside the final time then quietly picked off rivals one by one, rallied after the
second last to get into the mix then flattened out. JEFFERY G. settled towards the back, started losing ground on the others on the backside for the final
time then gained ground on tired rivals in the late going. SIDELING HILL raced towards the back gained some ground on the backside for the final time,
made a bid two fences from home then weakened through the stretch. DRIFT SOCIETY (IRE) raced midpack then started to give up ground on the
backside for the final time. JOSHUA G. showed the way of the second group most of the way then started his retreat four jumps from home. LE
CHEVALIER almost lost his rider at the first but the managed to stay together which shuffled him back to last, rated there until the fifteenth jump and then
started gaining ground on the leaders of the second group he gained command after the seventeenth fence after making another blunder, started opening
up on the field and had a lenthy lead over the second group when he made a mistake at the 20th jump losing his rider and walked off.
