FLEETERTHAN vied along the inside then edged away through the final furlong under moderate urging. ZECHA lacked speed, advanced on the rail to the
stretch, angled out and closed well. SEXYAMA settled inside just behind the leaders, moved wide in the stretch rallying. UNCAPTURED RUBY dueled the
winner outside to mid stretch and weakened. FRISKY FEELING lagged far behind for half a mile and closed the gap while no factor. KARABESSA prompted
the pace three then two wide and gave way. WINGS OF FURY dropped back early and stopped abruptly.

GRANDFIRE broke outward bumping a rival at the start, set the pace racing with a clear lead throughout, responded to some mild urging in upper stretch,
drew off to a long lead and was ridden out. FOX IN THE FOG raced off the pace outside a rival, moved up between horses on the far turn, rallied inside in
the final furlong and was along for the place spot. PRINCE CHAMP tracked along the inside, chased the winner on the far turn, weakened and lost second
late. FACTUM LOVE STYLE was bumped at the start, drifted out slightly on the first turn, raced off the pace inside and bested the others. REBEL
TRAVELLER raced four wide early, was steadied on the first turn, settled off the pace, went three wide on the far turn and faded. SLAM BANG was pinched
back at the break, raced inside and was outrun. OUR UNCLE DREW raced four wide on the first turn and gave way. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of
REBEL TRAVELLER against FACTUM LOVE STLYE for interference on the clubhouse turn, was dismissed.

WUSHU WARRIOR stumbled at the start, tracked the pacesetter, bid outside of that rival on the turn, responded when asked and drew clear under urging.
NICO BREE N TEEJ set the pace racing with a clear advantage, dueled with the winner passing the quarter pole, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive,
but second best. DROSSELMAGIC reluctant to load, chased close up on the inside, rallied mildly inside in the stretch and earned the show spot. THESE
BLUES raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn and bested the others. DODDSPRIVATELABEL raced three wide off the pace, then chased and failed
to rally. MANAHAWKIN raced off the rail, off the pace, three wide on the turn and did not factor. FREIBURG stalked the leaders and gave way.

Footnotes
SPRING EMPEROR raced off the pace inside, tracked the leaders, responded when asked in upper stretch, rallied inside in the final furlong and finished
willingly to win going away. BORSA VENTO showed good early speed to set the pace, showed the way into the far turn, dueled with STRONG BREEZE
passing the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and battled back late to get second. STRONG BREEZE stalked the pacesetter, moved up
midway on the far turn, bid at the quarter pole, put a head in front, dug in gamely outside in the stretch run and was outkicked late. TAP THE MARK raced
off the pace inside, moved up approaching the stretch and then finished evenly. THIS CAT CAN FLY raced three wide early, settled two wide off the pace
and lacked a rally. BOAT OVER THE HILL raced off the pace, had an inside trip and did not factor. NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ raced off the rail, off the pace,
chased three wide on the far turn and faded.

throughout, loomed a threat a furlong out but could not get by the winner. ECLIPSED MOON dropped far behind, advanced inside to the stretch and closed
well. FIST OF THOR carried out on the first turn, set the pace inside and weakened late. MIAMI TIGER raced wide just off the leaders and faded on the final
turn. FINGLAS pinched back at the start, bid wide on the final turn and was no factor. AMERICAN ROMA saved ground off the pace and proved empty in
the stretch. DELINQUENT trailed for five furlongs then passed fading rivals. DRUMMER DON lacked speed outside and steadily faded. CHRISATUDE bore
