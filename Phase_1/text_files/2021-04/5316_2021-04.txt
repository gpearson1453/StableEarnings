Footnotes
SUBSTANTIAL broke outward but alertly, showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, shook off the other speed into the stretch, increased that
advantage through the lane under steady handling. SHIP IT RED pressed the pace in the three path, proved no match in the drive, clearly second best.
DEFLATER forwardly placed along the inside, continued to race within striking distance turning for home directly behind the winner, had little left to the wire,
clear of the others. ROCK RIDGE off a step slow, raced back early, steadied along the inside into the turn, steered out to be four wide into the stretch,
improved bit upper stretch, not dangerous the final furlong. SACRED OATH fell back after the start, failed to menace while racing just off the inside.
HANSENS MISCHIEF prompted the pace while racing well off the inside, four wide into the turn, steadily faded.

Footnotes
RAM broke alertly, stalked the pace from along the inside while under restraint, let out a notch while steering out three wide midway on the final turn,
challenged three wide turning into the stretch, took over, shook clear and held that daylight advantage to the wire. HANKS dueled up front off the inside,
alternated up front in the run up the backstretch, vied between horses into the stretch, could not match strides with the winner the final furlong, proved game
for the place. AIR SHOW away in good order, set or forced the pace off the inside into the first turn, dropped in a bit when cleared in the run up the
backstretch, continued to vie when joined by the winner exiting the final turn, also could not keep up with that one the final furlong, outkicked for the place
spot while remaining closest to the inside of the first flight. BAKER'S MAN lacked speed off the inside, in the second group three wide turning into the
stretch, improved position a bit while not a threat to the top three at the end. CHROME RUN last away, lacked speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals
while not posing a serious threat. CHROME FINISH went one paced off the rail early, dropped inside 2nd turn, faded through the lane. TWIRLING ROSES
forwardly placed in traffic into the first turn, steadied, remained in the second flight off the inside the middle half then backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
TIME HEIST with the pace from the start while racing outside, got out when clear late in the turn, six wide into the lane, increased advantage under a steady
hand ride. THE BIG BLUFF void of speed toward the inside, two path exiting the turn, steered out steadily and then finished up willingly to be in time for the
place. IN THE ARCH last away, void of speed off the inside, three wide through the turn, rallied to be closest to but not threaten the winner inside the furlong
marker, flattened out a bit late, nipped late for the place. HUG THE MUNNY in mid pack off the rail, moved closer while four wide late in the turn, failed to
sustain that advance the final furlong. GREATER CAIRO broke alertly, raced forwardly and inside, remained within striking distance while continuing save
ground into the stretch, narrowly held the second spot past the furlong marker then faltered in the late going to lose a couple of positions. FUNANDFUNNY
went one paced while racing off the inside, failed to muster a closing response. LIMBO'S PROMISE off the pace and the inside, dropped to the rail late in
the turn, also lacked a closing kick. WYOMING CONQUEST vied up front in the two path, backed up in the drive. I'M A SPECIAL STAR four wide when
forwardly placed into the turn, stopped, trailed home, jogged in.

Footnotes
CATDADDY closest to the leader off the inside, roused three wide late in the final turn, collared the leader inside the furlong grounds, edged clear under
continued firm handling. RULER OF THE NILE settled off the early pace just off the inside, continued in the two path into the far turn, floated out four wide
into the stretch, late push to be up for the place. SECRET HOUSE broke well, got clear to show the way through the first turn, continued to show the way by
daylight second turn and into the stretch, called on for run nearing midstretch, weakened and could not contain the top two, narrowly lasted for the show.
INTREPID HEART hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, raced back for six furlongs, angled out sharply to be four wide into the stretch,
found best stride too late while widest through the lane. SHORTLIST one paced while three wide, continued outside, floated out five wide exiting the final
turn, went evenly in the late going. CASHANOVA off a step slow, remained always back. VANGILDER mid pack while inside, had little for the drive.

Footnotes
IMA BLING CAT broke outward but up front, dueled off the inside, three path into the lane, kicked strongly clear under a firm right handed crop. DOUBLE
BOGEY broke alertly, dueled up front inside the winner, proved no match for that one through the stretch, held the place. TWISTED DIXIE in mid pack while
off the inside, raced three wide through the turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest to be along for the show, steadily getting to runner up. LUCKY
BREAK bit fractious prestart, settled off the pace after breaking with the field, continued one paced through the lane in lacking a serious closing response.
MY LITTLE TIPSY closest to the dueling top two while in the two path for three furlongs, had little left for the drive. MACHO ROCKET MAN in the second
flight outside, raced four wide through the turn, weakened when the real running began at the head of the lane. CYBER MONDAY off a step slow, raced
back and well wide, five path through the turn, failed to muster a rally when called on into the stretch. DRIVER hopped at the break to be off slow, four wide
into the turn, remained back. ROCK CITY ROCKET made little impact while saving ground. DUCKTAIL trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
BLAME J D broke sharp, stalked the pace while racing in the three path, advanced and took over entering the stretch, drove quickly clear and was kept to
task the final furlong. MRS. BEANS settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground into the lane, shifted out past the furlong marker, proved no match
for the winner while gamely prevailing for the place. ROLLING FORK outrun in the early going off rail, three wide into the lane when moving closer, chased
the winner past the furlong marker, was outkicked in the late going for the place. GHOST STRATEGY off a step slow, lagged well back, flashed some
belated interest improve position in the late going. NAVY SEAL chased the early leader through a quick opening quarter, had little left for the stretch run.
DUSTY HILL away in good order, sprinted clear to set a clear early pace through a rapid fraction, gave way in the drive. ASPEN CLUB off the pace while
racing outside, four wide through the turn, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
MOLTO VIVACE closest to the leader off the inside, ranged up to challenge exiting the turn, extended drive while between horses, proved determined late
to be best. SAFFA'S DAY within striking distance off the inside, three wide through most of the turn, also moved to challenge turning for home while outside
the winner, vied to the wire, outkicked while remaining widest of the first flight. COLD AS HELL away well, cleared toward the inside, showed the way
through the turn, responded when confronted by the top two out of the turn, vied past the furlong marker then could not keep up, comfortably saved the
show. PLETCHER lacked early foot while off the inside, was never dangerous. LAWLESSNESS settled in mid pack inside, failed to respond when called on
for the drive. LOOKIN AT JUSTICE last to leave, trailed thoughout in showing little.

HILLARY G away in good order, prompted the winner from the outside for a half, asked along and advanced on that rival entering the stretch, challenged
past the furlong marker and spurted clear with a late burst under brisk handling. HEATED ARGUMENT broke alertly, sprinted clear soon after, continued to
show the way through the turn by daylight, briefly offered resistance when the winner came alongside in midstretch, then proved no match late, lasted for
the place. KABOOM BABY lacked early foot while outside, six wide into the turn, four wide exiting when beginning to advance, lugged in past the furlong
marker, continued with interest to the wire while remaining out in the strip to be getting to the runner up late. TYLER'S TYRONZA in mid pack while inside,
patiently handled into the turn, asked for run soon after, improved while inside of several rivals into the lane, flattened out a bit in the late going while
remaining toward the inside. HOT SPRINGS BLING void of speed after breaking a step slow, two path through the turn, also improved inside of traffic late in
the turn, one paced in the late going as well. DOLLY DIMPLE settled off the pace, two path exiting the turn, drifted out midstretch, finished up evenly in
lacking a late punch. BIG ON BROADWAY mid pack outside, in some traffic three wide into the turn, five wide exiting, went evenly through the stretch.
LADY ASTRID void of speed, behind some traffic late in the turn just off the inside, improved slightly while staying inside through the stretch. SMARTY'S
ANGEL off the pace and the inside, three wide into the lane, tired. LITTLE BURRITO within striking distance early, four wide and in traffic late in the turn,
faded through the stretch. TRIPLE HAPPY well off the pace outside, checked up in traffic while five wide early in the turn, fell back, trailed home.

Footnotes
HAMAZING WISDOM off a step slow, well back, moved out and began a strong rally four wide into the far turn, quickly reached the leader in upper stretch
and won going away in a sharp effort. ROCKTHEPULPIT five wide into the first turn when when with the second flight, continued outside, four wide into the
far turn, three wide exiting, rallied to be up for the place while no match for the winner. JAMES'S MOONSHINE broke on top, clear early, set a rather glib
pace toward the inside, offered little resistance to the winner when that one challenged a furlong out, caught late for the place. EGOMANIAC devoid of early
foot off the inside, four wide rally into the lane, finished up mildly to improve position, not a threat to the top three. LISTEN TO ROSE back off the pace,
improved while saving ground through the final turn, also was not a serious threat at the end. TROPHY DADDY in the second flight while racing just off the
inside, came up empty for the drive. GOOSE ALMIGHTY four wide into the first turn, raced within striking distance the middle half, tired in the drive. IT'S
BELLAMY TIME chased early along the inside, continued to save ground up the backstretch, brushed the rail into the far turn and weakened. DEMIGOD
back off the pace, in some traffic under restraint first turn, had nothing for the drive. FIRE TWO POINT O in the second flight while four wide into the first
turn, began a steady retreat before a half.
