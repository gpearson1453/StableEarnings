Footnotes
HEY ROXY stalked the early pacesetters from an inside pose down the backstretch, angled out to three wide nearing the five sixteenth pole and kicked
clear in the homestretch. DELETERIOUS showed reserve in the opening half while travelling the widest of all, entered the homestretch four wide and was
gaining at finish but had to settle for second best. TAPINDEED chased the early pacesetters from between rivals, maintained that stance through the turn
and passed tiring foes in the final furlong. TAYLA came away from offset a step tardy, was immediately hustled to the forefront, shared command through
the turn with LADY ABIGAIL, but weakened steadily in the closing strides. LADY ABIGAIL flashed early speed and shared the early command through the
opening half before fading rapidly.

MISS CASEY BETH broke alertly and assumed early command, led the field down the backstretch from a three wide stance and had a driving finish while
never relinquishing command. PUSSYCAT PUSSYCAT pressed the early pace as the outermost rival through the opening half, was in a striking pose at the
top of the lane, but was unable to match strides with winner in final furlong. DUCHES OF GRACE established an inside pose and stalked the pacesetter
along the backstretch and into the turn before losing ground to that pacesetter then closed with a rush to secure the show. BILLIE G pressed the pace from
between rivals then came up empty in the stretch drive. ARKANSAS INVASION gave chase as the widest of all foes and failed to threaten.
ITSAGRUFFWHIRL trailed from outset.

BELLA BLU loomed boldly from a two path pose, was sent for the drive in the vicinity of the quarter pole and drew off superbly. RIVER CHARMER set the
early pace while saving ground through the opening half, angled out just inside the quarter pole but proved no match for runaway winner. J LOVE stalked
the pacesetting duo around the first turn, closed the gap on the leaders along the backstretch, swung to three wide through far turn and finished evenly.
SMOKEY REFLECTION trailed the field through the first bend then lost ground to leaders in the far turn while travelling widest of all rivals. MS. WILD
ARGUMENT settled into second flight for the opening half and failed to threaten in crucial portion of contest.

BEAUREGARD rushed from outset to establish early command, was headed by MALIBU MO at the half pole, then came again through the final turn to
regain command and finished by widening the margin in the final furlong. HEPUTTHEACEINRACE settled as the lone rival into the second flight, was asked
for more nearing the five sixteenths pole and closed the gap on the leaders into the homestretch before finishing with courage to secure the place. YOUNG
SKYWALKER trekked along the three path throughout and earned the show with a late rally. MALIBU MO was hurried from outset, travelled three wide
through the opening turn, gained a brief command at the half pole, then steadily faded in the closing strides. JENNA'S GUN RUNNER showed reserve in
the opening half and was no threat while trekking the widest of all. HUNK OF A HIT trailed throughout while saving ground.

RAINTREE STARLET came away sharply, established immediate command and led every step to remain undefeated on the year. ZANADU showed
reserve and trekked as the widest of all rivals through the bend before earning the place with a rally. SHESOMAJESTIC stalked the pacesetter and eventual
winner from a three wide stance but was unable to sustain the bid in the final furlong. DICEY gave chase from a two wide pose and was no factor.
COUNTRY DAISY saved ground to no avail.

HONEST N LUCKY trekked three wide around the opening turn, closed the gap on pacesetter along the backstretch, was squeezed back near the quarter
pole then rallied strongly in the final furlong for the score. TIC TOC TOCCET travelled four wide early while showing reserve, was roused entering the far
turn and established a striking pose three wide at upper stretch before finishing with strong strides to win the nod for second. KOTTONCANDY KISSES
established a ground saving stance through the opening half, gained command at top of stretch, led the field at the eighth pole then gave way to late
charging rivals in final furlong. BETTY JEAN flashed early foot and led the field while travelling along the two path, was headed at the top of stretch and
failed to sustain the bid in the final strides. YANKEE PRIDE failed to threaten while trailing from outset.

MESA MOON hustled away from outset and shared command with EURAMASTER through the opening half as the innermost rival then kicked clear in the
final furlong for the victory. ONOMATOPOEIA stalked the pacesetter along the backstretch, angled three wide through the bend, was in a striking pose at
upper stretch but the winner proved too much in final furlong. TROY OUNCE settled into the second flight in opening stages, was four wide at upper stretch
and rallied mildly to secure the show. EURAMASTER weakened in the final furlong after sharing command early. VISUAL PUNCH saved ground to no avail.
PROUD MOMENTS failed to threaten from a wide stance.

FEAR THE FLASH settled into the second flight between rivals, lacked room near the quarter pole, angled out at the three sixteenths pole and finished
under a strong drive to earn the score. SATIN FINISH pressed the pace from a three wide pose and led the field at the eighth pole but was unable to fend
off the late charge of the eventual winner. RIVER RUBY hustled away from outset to share the early lead, saved ground through the bend, then gave way to
top pair in final furlong. MISS COFFEYVILLE was reserved for the opening half and improved placing with late interest. LIKE A CAT missed the break and
lost ground early to field, improved position by trekking four wide through the bend, and finished with a mild rally. EUROROPER rated well along the
backstretch as the outermost of four abreast, was three wide at upper stretch and weakened in crucial stages. GODDESS OF WONDER came up empty in
the stretch after giving chase to the frontrunners from a four path pose. GOSPEL TIZ JOY failed to threaten. SHEMINE FELINE was away a step slow and
roused for a rush to lead the field at the first call then faded rapidly in the closing portion of contest. KICKINBOTTEM trailed throughout.
