Footnotes
VISKI JONES always within striking distance while racing outside, rallied four wide through the far turn to engage the leader before the furlong marker and
proved best in a stiff drive under right handed urging. MAXIMIZER pressed the early pace two wide, made the lead before a half, set the pace under
pressure until deep stretch fought back gamely when headed but finished second best. MAGICAL EXPRESS never far back, finished with good courage in
the six path. ENJOY BASEBALL vied for the lead along the inside, shifted to the three path for racing room at the top of the stretch and finished
determinedly. CONDUCIVE set the early pace along the rail, kept pressure into the stretch and faded late. SAINTS MARCHING IN moved up three wide on
the far turn then came up empty. MALIBU WOOD trailed.

marker and drew clear under strong handling. GOLDEN AFLEET bumped at the start, sprinted to the lead, set the pace off the rail into the stretch then
couldn't handle the winner. SCHMULTZY stalked the early pace from the four path, dropped inside approaching the far turn, loomed boldly along the rail in

SYMPHONY HALL in the six path into the clubhouse turn, remained outside for a half, saved ground around the second turn, shifted back out for the drive,
closed determinedly four wide and was along in time. PABLO CREEK chased the pace from the two path into the far turn, angled out, rallied three wide to
make the lead at the top of the stretch, set the balance of the pace then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. THE NEW MIAMI pressed the pace
three wide into the far turn, dropped back a bit then came on again in deep stretch. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL was hustled from the gate to set the pace to
the top of the stretch then weakened late. BIG ANGEL was through after a half. IT'S ALL CASH had brief speed.

STRIKE APPEAL stalked the pace for five furlongs, responded readily when set down, rallied three wide on the far turn to make the lead nearing the quarter
pole then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best. GOOD ON YA pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, loomed boldly between horses
and finished clearly second best. ESKENDULCE was bumped at the start, moved closer two wide before a half, remained a sharp threat into the stretch,
drifted out late and finished with good courage in the six path. ADHHAR away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside into the far turn then weakened.
LEVANTO (ARG) failed to menace. HOMERS MAGIC was bumped at the start and through after a half. VAN DAMME bore out bumping rivals at the start
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ARMADA made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and widened through the stretch under brisk handling to win as much the best. CHOCOLATE
PHILLING pressured the winner three then two wide and was no match while well clear for second. FLAT OUT OF CREDIT bore in at the start, was
corrected, allowed to settle then had a mild late rally in the five path. FUNNY BACHELOR pressed the early pace between horses two wide and faded in the
stretch. FOREVERJUMBONMIKE had good early speed along the rail, checked when in tight at the nine sixteenths pole and dropped out of it. COUNT
BRIAN stumbled inward at the start then trailed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
