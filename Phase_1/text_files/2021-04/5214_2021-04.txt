SHERWOOD LADY broke awkwardly then rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, drifted a bit into the lane but dug
in under an all out drive to just last. ALPINE MOON settled off the pace and off the rail early on, rallied leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the three
and four paths of the far turn, steadily gained through the lane and just missed. GAB'S LIL LEAGUER rated off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole
and rounded the far turn about the four path and was along for third mid-stretch. LONGSTORYLUCY saved early ground racing well off the pace, came
through the far turn in the three and four paths then passed a rival in the lane. HOUSE OF LOVE raced off the pace inside and showed little response
through the backstretch. MARY'S LISTED NEXT entered the opening turn about the five path then stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward
the three eighths pole, though, faded at the rail on the far turn.

RULING accelerated to the front leaving the half mile pole and set the pace off the rail, came under pressure midway on the turn and was steadily handled
down the lane. KYLE was unprepared at the breakand came away awkwardly, raced well back from early contention, eased out at the three eighths pole
and started a bid nearing the quarter, came through most of the turn in the four path but angled to the eight path approaching the top of the stretch and dug
in under steady encouragement to take second under the wire. WIZARD OF ODDS gave chase through the backstretch and raced in the six and seven
paths on the turn, was carried further outward entering the stretch, dug in from that point but was nipped from second under the wire. MOUNTED COP
chased outside, raced in the six path of the turn, drifted a bit toward the top of the lane and raced evenly through the stretch. THE FORTY FACTOR gave
chase, raced four wide on the turn and finished evenly. PORT MORE gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path, angled
to the six path toward the eighth pole, was apprehensively ridden through the stretch then steadied later yards. BEARCAT KITTEN chased toward the
inside, steadied at the rail leaving the three eighths pole then weakened. ICE KAUFY gave chase, raced in the three and four paths on the turn and showed
little further. ON THIS DAY engaged in close early chase, raced in range about the three path of the turn then weakened the final sixteenth.

WHOA BLACK BETTY steadied between horses early and settled off the pace in the five and six paths the opening turn, started a bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn but was carried to the eight path approaching the top of the lane, dug in leaving the turn, took the lead
mid-stretch and held on under steady handling. LINE OF ROSES saved early ground off the pace, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and
rounded the far turn in the nine and ten paths, dueled for second past the sixteenth pole and was gaining on the winner. AZNAVOUR settled off the pace
toward the inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then finished well to take third later yards. USED TO BE FUN
stalked off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and dueled to a slim lead two deep midway on the far turn, but drifted toward the head of the lane and
flattened stride the final sixteenth. CLASSY ESCORT settled inside the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, bid past the three eighths pole, ran
in the eight path of the far turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. VIOLANE raced in the six path the first turn, showed little response through the
backstretch and rounded the far turn about the three path. AFANDI rated the early pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and was
caught at the rail midway on the far turn, then weakened the final furlong. COWGIRL NIGHT raced off the pace in the three and four paths of the opening
turn, left the turn outside and gave chase from the three eighths pole, though, weakened through the far turn. RAINBOW RIVER stalked the earlier pace in
the three and four paths, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then weakened on the far turn.

Footnotes
LUCKY PENGUIN angled in to stalk from the three path, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep approaching the quarter,
dueled clear past the pole and was steadily encouraged to widen. RUM RUNNER RED saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole
and rounded the far turn in the two and three paths, angled out leaving the far turn and dueled through the stretch for second. JACKLIGHTING raced in the
five and six paths the first turn and left the turn outside, bid toward the three eighths pole, continued in the four and five paths of the far turn then outfinished
in the stretch duel for second. BRAVE NATIVE settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid toward the three eighths pole and angled to the six path
approaching the top of the stretch, then finished well to pass rivals through the lane. THORN OF ROSE HILL ran in the five path the first turn, bid toward the
seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the seven path then passed rivals widest in the stretch. MASTER YOO raced well off the pace while
saving ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, eased out entering the stretch, but showed little further.
YESIKNOWWHOIAM saved ground close to the early pace, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three path of the far
turn, then weakened past the eighth pole. SHORT CAKE'S MAN raced well off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch. WINTER IS
HERE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail approaching the quarter, dropped back past
the pole, raced at the rail through the far turn then weakened. TURNER ASHBY bobbled leaving the gate then steadied a stride later, raced in the four path
the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened in the seven path of the far turn. This race was hand timed.
