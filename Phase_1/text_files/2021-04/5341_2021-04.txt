Footnotes
WILL KNOWS tracked the pace four wide early, engaged SACRA HOXEN into the turn, took the lead two wide near the three eighths with SACRA HOXEN
remaining in close pursuit, lost the lead again to that foe in upper stretch but stayed in close range to his outside, took the lead again approaching the
furlong pole, and cleared while ridden out in the final sixteenth. SACRA HOXEN sent for speed inside, was engaged by WILL KNOWS to his outside into the
turn, lost the lead to that foe near the three eighths but kept on to attend the pace from the inside, was driven to take the lead again inside of that foe in
upper stretch, lost the lead for good approaching the furlong mark and was no match in the final sixteenth. LONG STATION tracked the leader between
horses early, continued to track the leading pair while saving ground on the turn, swung out into the five path in upper stretch, went to a drive approaching
the three sixteenths, and chased on evenly late. MIAS MOONBEAM chased in second last early, raced in the four path on the turn, went to a drive in the six
path past the three sixteenths, but lacked the needed kick. CITALI soon trailed, saved ground around the turn, was driven in the three path in upper stretch,
and offered no rally. SERTOMAN tracked the pace between horses three wide early, weakened in the three path on the turn, was driven in the six path in
upper stretch, and had no response in the lane.

Footnotes
APOLLO U ANYWHERE was urged to the lead right out of the gate, saved ground around the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch and
around the far turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was kept to the drive to hold off a late closer. WINDY CITY GIRL saved ground around the first
turn, settled in behind the leaders on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path around the far turn, and chased the winner
homer, falling short in the final sixteenth of a mile. IMBUED saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the
backstretch, began to move up headed into the far turn, entered the stretch from the three path and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly.
HONEY MUG saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, and weakened in the
stretch after her rider dropped the crop at the three sixteenths pole. SUMMER EXPRESS was bumped and shuffled back leaving the gate, raced in the two
path around the first turn, came up the backstretch well off the pace, angled in to save ground around the far turn and improved mildly on the rail in the final
furlong. CATNIP KITTEN bumped slightly with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, angled over sharply to save ground around the first turn, trailed the
field on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. BETTER ANGELS was fractious in the
gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and was not a
threat. MAGNITUDE TEN settled in the middle of the pack in the two path for the opening half mile, raced in the two and three path around the far turn and
faded in the stretch. GOLDEN LILY raced at the back of the pack in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back further
while racing in the two path around the far turn and continued to tire in the stretch.

Footnotes
OUT ONA LIMB was away well inside, tracked the leader down the backstretch, saved ground while tracking the leading pair on the turn, switched two wide
in upper stretch, went to a drive approaching midstretch, reeled in the pacesetter past the sixteenth and drove clear. COOKIN ROSES was bumped by
SHEZ A BULLY in the opening strides but nonetheless sent for the lead, set the pace while saving ground on the turn, was confronted by SHEZ A BULLY to
her outside near the five sixteenths, shook that foe off into the lane, went to a drive approaching the furlong mark, but was caught past the sixteenth mark.
SILVER SULLY chased the leading trio down the backstretch and while saving ground on the turn, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, chased on under
a drive inside in the lane, lacked the needed kick to threaten the top two but held for show. GRAMMAR settled at the rear, raced in the two to three path on
the turn, began to improve position despite drifting out when driven in upper stretch, offered a mild rally but missed the show. FULL OF HEART broke
outward, settled near the rear, made a mild bid in the three path on the turn, drifted out while driven in upper stretch and flattened. SHEZ A BULLY was
fractious in the gate, bumped COOKIN ROSES in the opening strides after breaking inward, was sent after the leading pair into the turn, engaged COOKIN
ROSES near the five sixteenths, began to weaken in upper stretch, had no more when driven, and was allowed to fade from midstretch.

Footnotes
FUDGE BROWNIE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, got rolling
approaching the five sixteenths pole and gained ground quickly between horses to pull clear in the final sixteenth. MIDNIGHT FROST swerved slightly
leaving the gate, settled in to stalk the leaders on the outside up backstretch, was carried out to the eight path when VALE OF EVESHAM ran out midway
around the turn, was urged in front of that rival to angle in and save some ground for what remained of the turn, and improved position on the outside while
drifting out slightly in late stretch. HOODWINK led the field on the inside up the backstretch, drifted out mildly to race in the two and three path around the
turn, kicked clear with a furlong to go and was caught late. READY AT MIDNIGHT raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the early going, began a
bid from the two path near the three eighths pole, and continued to gain ground mildly through the stretch. ENGLISH raced at the back of the pack on the
inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and gained ground on the rail late. FORTHELOVEOFLYDIA pressed the pace on the outside up the
backstretch, was carried out slightly and raced in the three and four path around the turn, continued to duel in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong.
VALE OF EVESHAM was blocked leaving the gate, recovered quickly to stalk the leaders on the inside, ran out sharply around the turn, carrying MIDNIGHT
FROST with her to the nine path, fought her rider and eventually corrected course and was empty from there. CARMEN O'ELECTRA swerved out sharply
leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn and was never a factor. HOLY STAR raced in the middle of
the pack on the outside, drifted very wide while racing around the turn, entered the stretch in the middle of the track and made no bid.

Footnotes
HIGH HERO was sent for speed, set the pace inside while pressed by CAT ON THE ROOF, turned back that foe at the head of the stretch, cleared, and
held his advantage to the wire while kept to the task and drifting out slightly. W W RUSSIAN GOLD tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the
two path on the turn, was driven along the rail in upper stretch, proved no match for the leader but kept on evenly for the place. TRES GENERACIONES
settled at the rear down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, swung out into upper stretch and went to a drive, and offered a mild four wide rally.
AZUSA ST. tracked the leading pair between horses down the backstretch, continued to track the leading pair two wide on the turn, went to a drive near the
five sixteenths, came into the lane three wide, chased on in upper stretch while no match for HIGH HERO, and flattened in the final furlong. CAT ON THE
ROOF pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch and through the bend, could not keep pace with HIGH HERO when driven into the lane and faded.
MAJESTIC HERO chased four wide early, flattened in the four path on the turn, was driven five wide in upper stretch and offered no rally.

LEMON KICK was fractious in the gate, bumped mildly with the horses to either side leaving the gate, raced in the two path between horses around the turn,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, launched a bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole, bumped mildly with DOODLE TIME
a furlong out, and gained ground steadily from there to just get up in time. IM A COWBOY TOO raced in the three path between horses around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn still in the three path, launched a bid approaching the quarter
pole and gained ground quickly on the outside in late stretch, just missing. WAR CHEST pressed the pace from the three path around the first turn and up
the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn, dueled gamely down the lane and was caught in the final stride. DOODLE TIME raced in the three
path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the outside, angled in to save ground around the far turn, launched a bid
in upper stretch and ran into traffic, was blocked and forced to steady with a furlong to go, bumping slightly with LEMON KICK in the process, found room
late and gained ground from there but ran out of ground. CURLINGTON saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch,
continued to save ground around the far turn, ran into traffic near the eighth pole, angled in sharply to find room and improved position from there. TAP THE
MOJO chased the leaders while saving ground around the first turn, settled in to stalk the pace setters on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save
ground around the far turn, took over in upper stretch and gave way in the final strides. HONEST TO GOODNESS raced in the three path around the first
turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and passed tiring horses on the outside in the stretch.
PERFECTLY MAJESTIC ran into traffic and was forced to steady headed into the first turn, saved ground from there, came up the backstretch in the middle
of the pack on the inside, continued to save ground around the turn and weakened on the rail in the final furlong. AMENDED led the field from the two path
around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn, began to weaken approaching the eighth pole and continued to
fade in the final furlong. HERE COMES KYLE chased the leaders from the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside,
began to drop back while racing in the three path around the far turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
MKAR THE FAST tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and two wide on the turn, advanced when driven four wide into the lane, loomed
midstretch, was taken slightly further out near the sixteenth mark and came in time to nail the leader. IRISH TUFF tracked CLEMSON TIGER down the
backstretch and two wide into the turn, encroached on the leader near the three eighths, was driven three wide in upper stretch, got past the pacesetter near
the furlong marker, kept on under a drive but was nailed at the wire. A BOLD RYDE chased outside of BILLY NOT WILLIAM down the backstretch, lost
position in the three path on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, began to rally when driven near the three sixteenths despite drifting out further,
found his best past the furlong mark and got up for the show. MON AMI FUZZIE settled at the rear, saved ground through the turn, was pushed along from
near the three eighths, was taken four wide into upper stretch and driven near the three sixteenths, drifted out midstretch but nonetheless rallied well in the
final furlong, but was narrowly outkicked for the show. CLEMSON TIGER was sent for pace, saved ground through the turn, was confronted by IRISH TUFF
to his outside near the three eighths, continued to cling to the lead until being headed near the furlong mark, and flattened in the final sixteenth. BILLY NOT
WILLIAM chased inside early, was pushed along while saving ground on the turn, went to a drive two wide in upper stretch while in range, but emptied out
at the three sixteenths.

Footnotes
MARY OF BETHANY raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two
path around the far turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held off the late closers down the lane. DELLA FROST saved ground around the first turn,
settled in to stalk the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn, swung wide entering the stretch to began a bid near
the quarter pole, gained ground throughout the stretch and just missed. GLITTERARY raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground around the far turn and improved position in the final furlong. NURSE SADIE broke slowly,
trailed the field from the rail around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, began a bid nearing the quarter pole
and gained ground between horses late. PERFECT DIVA was reluctant to load, hopped up leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field on the inside
through the opening half mile, dueled for the lead while saving ground around the far turn and faded in the final furlong. VOL DE SOLEIL was bumped and
pinched back leaving the gate, carried four wide around the first turn, moved up from the outside on the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from
the two path and finished evenly. BIRD KEY bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, came around the first turn in the three path, continued
up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and was empty from there. COUGER hopped up leaving
the gate, raced into tight quarters while in the two path headed into the first turn, angled out to find room, chased the leaders on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and tired. HOLY SOUL saved ground around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack up the
backstretch, began to drop back further while still on the rail around the far turn and made no bid.
