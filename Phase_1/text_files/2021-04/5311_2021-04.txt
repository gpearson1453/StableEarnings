Footnotes
IRISH DECLARATION settled off of the early pace, settled through the backstretch run, came four wide on the second turn while advancing position, took
control inside of the eighth pole and kicked clear in the drive. SILVER FURY was hustled to the lead, saved ground along the inside while setting fractions,
led inside of the eighth pole, was confronted by IRISH DECLARATION and could not hold that one off, while still holding for second. UNION LEADER
settled through the early stages, maintained a three wide running position through the second turn while still toward the rear of the field, and made a late bid
in the stretch to get third. HYPERSONIC was three wide on the first turn, chased the early pace through the backstretch and run on the second turn, was
between horses three wide on the second turn, and was outfinished in the stretch. KATZUMOTO settled just off of the early pace, continued to be close to
the lead through the backstretch and run on the second turn while two wide, was asked for run into the stretch and tired late. ALLEYCAT had no speed
early, was outrun into the backstretch run, was three wide on the turn while losing ground, and stopped and eased in the stretch, and walked off.

Footnotes
WAHASHA had the best speed and set all the pace two wide to the stretch, edged away to mid stretch and held under steady urging. SNOOZY SUZY was
chasing the pace to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then was outrun to mid stretch but kept on busily for the place. WINNING APPEAL had
MISS PEG drift inward in front of her, clipped that one's heels and stumbled shortly after the start, recovered then was forced to circle five wide to the
stretch and finished in a rally. ARDTREA was stalking the winner from the rail to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch and finished evenly. HEMATITE
pressed the pace in the three path to the stretch then was outkicked by the winner to mid stretch and weakened late. LIL TINKER broke slow, was pushed
along early to get into contention, raced three wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch but was fading late. LOVELY HUSSAR also broke slow, hustled
up inside rivals but had to steady off heels at the half mile pole, came two wide to the stretch but was not a factor. GAMER BABZ had no speed, raced two
then three wide on the turn and was also no threat. MISS PEG got outsprinted to the turn, raced four wide to the stretch and did not rally. BROADWAY
BABE was chasing from the rail to mid turn then gave way.

Footnotes
TYLER'S TEK settled in the early running, saved ground through the second turn while improving position, angled out for the stretch drive, dug in for the
stretch run and held on for the win. IMPLICITLY settled toward the rear of the field early, continued to travel toward the back while four wide on the second
turn, improved position off of the turn, made a bold late rally to pressure TYLER'S TEK, and could not reel that foe in but was second best. TOUGH IT OUT
stalked the early pace through backstretch run, was two wide along the second turn while still pressuring the leader, took the lead coming into the stretch
but could not hold off oncoming challengers and held for third. PIONEEROFTHESTORM set the early fractions from a ground saving trip through the
backstretch and second turn, continued to save ground into the stretch run, was confronted by TOUGH IT OUT inside the eighth pole and tired late. FOUR
O'FIVE bobbled at the start, then was pinched leaving the gate by neighboring rivals, was three wide around the first turn, settled at the back of the field
while saving ground through the second turn, improved position along the turn but could not go on with that bid and flattened late. LIL AWECIM settled just
off of the early pace, continued to sit just off pace through backstretch and second turn while two wide, lost position along the turn and weakened in the
stretch drive. FRIENDLY OUTTHEDOR was allowed to settle toward the rear of the field early, saved ground through the backstretch and second turn and
had no response in the stretch drive.

close up, was outrun off of the second turn and was outfinished late. TIZNO'S DILEMMA settled in the midflight through the early stages, gained while four
wide along the second turn but could not go on with that bid and finished evenly in the stretch. MYBLUEBELL (FR) was four wide along the first turn, chased
the early pace in the backstretch, was three wide along the second turn while improving position, was asked for run into the stretch but could not keep pace
and tired late. ESCAPE THE CITY (GB) was unhurried early, maintained a two wide running position while trailing through the backstretch and second turn,
was asked for run into the stretch but could not mount a late bid. CREATIVE ROMANCE settled in the middle of the pack through the early stages, was
three wide along the second turn while losing position, was outrun off of the turn and had no late response in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
NEXT FLIGHT chased the leaders to the turn, circled five wide then eased out widest for the drive, responded when roused and closed fast to be along in
time. RALLY CAT stalked the pace to the turn, rallied two wide to engage for the lead in mid stretch, battled BOLD ROMAN gamely through the final furlong
but was nailed by the winner late. BOLD ROMAN dueled for the lead three wide to the stretch, responded determinedly when hooked by the runnerup, dug
in gamely and just missed. CINDERELLAS PRINCE was chasing inside to the stretch, lacked room to mid stretch behind RALLY CAT but shifted out then
could not offer the needed late response. MISTER MOJO got outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, was a threat leaving mid stretch but was
outfinished. MISTER MCLEAN attended the pace early, pressed while being fanned four wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally.
KINCAID PARK trailed while four wide, eased down the two path into the stretch but also lacked a late response. FUZZY DOLPHIN stalked the pace while
three wide to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong.
