Footnotes
RED HOT CAT pressed the pace of FLASH OF GREY while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear
margin into the lane and drew off with complete authority. RUNNING TO WIN raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out
further in mid-stretch, could not gain on the winner but finished well to gain the place. RIVER KAI was reserved just off the leaders from between foes,
moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. RULER OF ANGELS tracked the leaders from the inside, lacked racing room into the
stretch, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good courage when clear. ERRIGAL chased the leaders while racing five-wide throughout and weakened
in the drive. FLASH OF GRAY set a pressured pace and weakened after going three-quarters.

Footnotes
LINGUA FRANCA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide though the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and wore down
SOUTHEAST ASIA in the final yards. SOUTHEAST ASIA stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths
pole, gained a slight advantage, remained in control through mid-stretch but could not hold the winner safe late. GEM STATE was forwardly placed from the
inside, angled out nearing the quarter and failed to gain late. IRISH SWING was off a step slow, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn
and finished with a belated bid. CLASSY CHASIE was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. IVORIAN showed
no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and failed to offer a bid. FORT YORK sprinted clear soon after the start
and weakened after going three-quarters.

SHE SAID YES sprinted clear before going a quarter, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority.
MARZANNA raced closest to the winner throughout, was no match for that foe in the drive but clearly second best. MOONS OVER MEXICO settled off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. LADY MOHICAN was off slow, raced unhurried early and did not reach
contention. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace.

MEET MISS KITTY raced unhurried early, advanced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, wore down RAIDERETTE in the final
yards to be going away late. RAIDERETTE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, increased her margin through the turn and gave
way to the winner late. AMBER LOUISE settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, reached a striking position into the stretch and finished
evenly late. FELONY ONE was forwardly placed early, raced four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. EMPRESSIVE CAT
tracked the pace of RAIDERETTE from the inside and weakened through the final furlong. SARI'S TIGER lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn,
angled in with a furlong to run and was not a factor.

three-wide and failed to gain in the drive. THEULTIMATEPRAISE was off a step slow, lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out
further into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. ZOFFA was void of early speed, moved up four-wide off offer a bid nearing the quarter and weakened in

J T'S WATCH was checked soon after the start, raced unhurried early, advanced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch, wore
down OMPH in the closing yards and was going away late. OMPH stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid in mid-stretch, gained
a brief lead but could not match strides with the winner late. MR. PICKLES settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the second turn, angled out
from between foes nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with good courage. SEAHAWK CODY pressed the pace of THEYREMINISCEOVERU
while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. THEYREMINISCEOVERU set a pressured pace for six furlongs and weakened.
