Footnotes
SWEET QUEEN BEE pressed the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, took over command and drew clear late under a steady drive.
BERNADETTE THE JET tracked the pace early along the inside, stayed on the rail into the lane, lacked room and put in tight from the rail in the upper
stretch, altered out late but much too late. SPY A STAR raced back early on, was blocked in the turn along the rail, was off the rail into the lane and moved
up late in the stretch run. OLLIE'S GOLD set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and faltered late in the stretch drive. LETS TAKE IT IZZY stalked
the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. SLAINTE chased the pace early, was shuffled back along the turn, raced in
the four path into the lane, came again in the stretch and improved position late. ONES was through after a half. SUPER LUCY was bothered at the start,
raced along the five path into the lane. STANCHION was through after a half. SOME NIGHTS was bumped nearing the seven sixteenths pole and folded up
down the lane. READY N WAITING stumbled badly at the start, was bothered in the upper stretch.

Footnotes
SPICE IS NICE bumped with an inner foe twice at the start, lied off of the pace three wide and outside of foes around the first turn, advanced to a stalking
position while perched outside of the leaders into the backstretch, inched closer around the far turn with MARKET RUMOR to catch, ranged up alongside
that one turning for home, was fended off through upper stretch, but determinedly wore her rival down a sixteenth out under a long drive. MARKET RUMOR
stalked the pace setter from the outside around the first turn, vied with that foe into the backstretch, forged an advantage into the far turn with SPICE IS
NICE giving chase, showed the way from that rival around that bend, dug in to maintain a margin through upper stretch, but was worn down in the late
stages. MOVIE MOXY lied off of the pace two wide and between horses around the first turn, advanced to stalk from right behind the leaders into the
backstretch, tipped outside of the embattled duo around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with them entering the lane, then fended off MAEDEAN for
show. MAEDEAN exchanged a pair of bumps with an outer foe at the start, lied off of the pace along the inside, got rank into the first turn before trailing the
field around it, then took the far turn four wide, and failed to factor. STOP WAR set the pace along the inside, but gave way to a pair of outer foes into the far
turn, and weakened thereafter.

Footnotes
TOBYS HEART lied forwardly placed two wide and between horses down the backstretch, tracked around the turn before tipping outside of the leading
quartet at the three sixteenths pole, quickened passing the furlong grounds, and drove past GION' GOOD approaching the wire. GOIN' GOOD stalked three
wide, perched herself outside of the leading pair around the turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane before making a four wide bid for the lead at the
furlong pole, forged an advantage inside of that marker with TOBY'S HEART giving chase, but was worn down by that rival with thirty yards to go.
NAVRATILOVA vied for the lead outside of PHANTOM VISION, battled between horses through midstretch after GOIN GOOD ranged up alongside, but
was outkicked by that foe and another rival approaching the sixteenth grounds. PHANTOM VISION set the pace along the inside, shifted to the two path
entering the lane, which allowed NEW BOSS to attempt a rail bid dug in between horses through midstretch, but yielded through the final sixteenth.
SALVAJE dropped her head right before the gates opened, causing her to be unprepared for the start and off slowly, then lied at the rear of the field two
wide and between horses, and failed to factor. ALDA lied off of the pace three wide, shifted to the five path turning for home, but lacked a rally. NEW BOSS
stalked along the inside, attempted a bid for the lead along the rail inside of a trio of foes at the three sixteenths pole, but flattened out through the final
furlong. INAJIFFY saved ground at the rear of the field, but never got involved.

Footnotes
ANSWER IN lied off of the pace three wide and between horses down the backstretch, perched himself four wide and outside of foes into the turn, got
floated five wide while turning or home, but sustained a rally to bid at the furlong grounds, forged an advantage at the sixteenth pole, then held from an
oncharging ALOHA WEST to the wire. ALOHA WEST lied at the rear of the field two wide around the turn, came into the lane in the four path, altered
course outside of the leaders to the six path approaching the furlong pole, quickened through the late stages, surged outside of the leaders approaching the
wire, but missed. KING SNAKE chased three to two wide around the turn, shifted four wide turning for home while inside of ANSWER IN, bid for the lead
simultaneously with that rival passing the furlong pole, dug in gamely as that foe forged a narrow advantage, but was outkicked approaching the wire.
GROWL TIGER set the pace two wide early on, cleared an inner foe at the half mile pole, but stayed in the two path around the turn, met a rail bid from MY
MAN FLINSTONE and a pair of multiple outer rivals at the furlong pole, then yielded between them a sixteenth out. MY MAN FLINTSTONE lied forwardly
placed in the two path early on, tracked from along the inside around the turn, produced a rail bid through a narrow seam in upper stretch, forged an
advantage at the furlong pole while a pair of outer foes produced bids, but flattened out shortly thereafter. WILD BEHAVIOR tracked from midpack four
wide, chased the clear leader three wide around the turn, but faded between horses in upper stretch. GOZILLA pressed GROWL TIGER from along the
inside early on, allowed that foe to clear into the turn, chased from the two path around the bend, but faded in upper stretch. SCHMOOZIN saved ground far
off of the pace, but was outrun.

Footnotes
RAGING BULL (FR) tracked from midpack along the inside, rolled past outer rivals along the rail turning for home, loomed large turning for home before
tipping three wide to produce a bid entering the lane, quickly drove clear approaching the three sixteenths pole, and held sway under firm hand urging
through the final furlong. RIDE A COMET trailed along the inside, took the far turn in the three path before swinging seven wide turning for home, rallied
outside of foes through the lane, dueled for place outside of SACRED LIFE through the final furlong while chasing the clear leader, and prevailed over that
foe approaching the wire. SACRED LIFE (FR) lied at the rear of the field two wide, shifted five wide in upper stretch, stayed on between horses through
midstretch while hanging on his left lead, battled for place inside of RIDE A COMET through the final furlong, but was bested by that foe for that position
approaching the wire. FIELD PASS stalked from the two path, rallied four wide around the far turn, bid for the lead outside of RAGING BULL (FR) entering
the lane, but was swiftly outkicked passing that marker, then chased that foe thereafter before fading through the late stages. HIT THE ROAD saved ground
far off of the pace, chased from behind the leaders through upper stretch, shifted inwards at the furlong grounds to aim for a rail bid, but leveled off before
reaching contention. DARAIN (GB) lied off of the pace in the three to four path, swung six wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally on his left lead.
SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN pressed two wide, vied between horses down the backstretch, sustained vying position turning for home, but offered little
resistance to the eventual winner in upper stretch, and tired. GET SMOKIN broke a bit outwardly, set the pace inside of a pair of pressing foes into the
backstretch, showed the way around the far turn, but was headed at the quarter pole, and weakened in upper stretch. FLYING SCOTSMAN prompted the
pace three wide, but weakened into the far turn, and wilted through the lane.

Footnotes
CARAMEL SWIRL perched herself four wide and outside of rivals, swept past the leaders turning for home, quickly drew off in upper stretch, and widened
under driving pressure. FRONT STREET stalked along the inside, swung outside of the leading quartet entering the lane, proved no match for the leader in
upper stretch, but kept on to prove second best. MO DEAN stalked three wide, pressed from between horses around the turn, but proved no match for her
outer rival turning for home. MUSICAL CAT prompted the pace two wide, then from between horses around the turn, but tired in upper stretch. FINE
COTTON set the pace along the inside, felt pressure from a trio of rivals around the turn, but proved no match for the eventual winner at the quarter pole,
and tired in upper stretch. RED HOT AND BLUE trailed, swung to the six path turning for home, and passed tired foes. FLORIS hesitated briefly when the
gates opened, lied off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, and failed to factor. FROZAY ALL DAY was done early.
