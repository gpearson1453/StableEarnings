JULIET'S MUSIC slipped through inside to the lead midway on the turn then edged away driving while remaining safe. FOUR SEASONS GIRL settled
inside, angled out on the turn then closed strongly too late. DONA CAMILE dueled three wide, was outrun on the turn and flattened out in the stretch. OUR
CLAIRE BEAR chased inside at the back of pack then offered some late energy. RAGAZZA CARINA was urged within striking range then began stopping
on the turn. MRS. PHELPS led narrowly in the two path to midway on the turn and gave way. DRIVER'S LICENSE lacked speed and began fading after a
quarter mile.

RUNS FOR LUCK raced off the pace, moved up between rivals on the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside, surged in deep stretch and was up
late for the win. POWERFUL VENEZUELA raced off the pace inside, moved up nearing the stretch, rallied near the rail in the stretch run and finished
willingly late. ROCKIN COWBOY vied between rivals for the early lead, gained a short lead on the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch, began to weaken, then
drifted out late under left handed urging and bumped ASK CHUCK nearing the wire. ASK CHUCK raced off the pace, moved up inside on the turn, rallied on
the rail into the stretch, angled out, closed steadily and was bumped and forced to steady nearing the finish. MAJESTIC JAZZ vied three wide for the early
lead, chased on the turn and weakened. INCENSED steadied at the start and did not factor. SMART ROYAL T was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside
and did not factor. BOBCAT stumbled at the start, chased outside and tired. MORE THAN STRIKING vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and faded.
DIAMOND SQUARE chased outside and faded. After a Jockey's Objection, ROCKIN COWBOY was disqualified and placed fourth for interference in deep
stretch.

OUR STORMIN NORMAN settled close up inside, angled out to secure room into the stretch then wore down the pacesetter in a steady drive. TOO MUCH
JOHNNIE set the pace just off the inside, widened briefly in mid stretch but was nailed late. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE prompted the leaders three wide to the
stretch and weakened. ROYAL COUP lacked speed, advanced wide on the turn with a mild bid. REFI dropped far back in the opening quarter then showed
some late energy. HEART OF A DREAMER chased wide within striking range early then faded on the turn. WEEKEND IN COURT broke very slowly and
was never in contention. KAIROS saved ground off the pace and weakened steadily. BILL'S MAFIA dropped back inside in the opening quarter and stopped
abruptly.

determinedly late. CAPITAN FOFO chased three wide, rallied three wide into the stretch and dug in gamely outside to the wire. GREENBACK broke in
bumping a rival at the start, chased inside, angled out at the eighth pole and rallied mildly outside. FREEDOM FORCE set the pace on the inside, dueled
with the winner on the turn and weakened in the stretch drive. GRAYS THE BAR was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, came three wide into
the lane and failed to threaten. RISING STORM raced three wide off the pace and failed to threaten. FEAR NONE raced off the pace between horses and
lacked a rally. UNCLE MANNY chased between rivals and tired. NEO was bumped hard at the start, raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the turn and
