FIRST COURSE raced back early on, was off the rail into the lane for the final time, altered out four wide nearing the eighth pole under a rally and ran down
the leader in the final stages. CANDY FLOWER set the pace from the outset along the inside, stayed on the rail into the lane for the final time, opened up a
clear advantage near the quarter pole and remained clear to inside the sixteenth pole but was ran down in the final stages. TASAAMUH stalked the pace
early on, was on the inside into the lane, made a bid in the stretch from the inside, altered out near the eighth pole and finished willingly in the final stages.
SURSUM CORDA chased the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. YA BEAUTY (GB) chased the pace
early on, was in the four path into the lane and leveled off down the lane. JAZZY LADY tracked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, checked inside
the eighth pole and weakened late in the drive. TALKING BOOK raced keen into the first turn and into the second turn, was in the three path entering the
lane for the final time with no gain in the stretch run. TOOTSIE was through after a half and raced widest down the lane.

Footnotes
BLUE STEEL set the pace two wide into the first turn, cleared his inner counterpart after a quarter pole, managed a loose lead down the backstretch and
around the far turn, drew off when let out entering the lane, and was kept to task under mild urging. VALYCOVE exchanged bumps with CONGRATS THIS
passing the second wire for the first time, lied off of the pace in the two path, gained three wide around the far turn, battled outside of TRES EQUIS for place
through the lane, and edged that position from that foe through the final furlong. TRES EQUIS tracked from midpack along the inside, advanced to stalking
position into the far turn, shifted two wide entering the lane, then chased from between horses through the final furlong but was outfinished by his outer
counterpart for place. ZANESVILLE was off a step slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, and offered a mild chasing rally along the rail through the lane.
SUBDUED stalked from the three path, chased the leader two wide while being that foe's closest pursuer around the far turn, but faded between horses
approaching the furlong pole. FORECASTLE bobbled at the start, trailed along the inside, and saved ground but to no avail. CONGRATS THIS exchanged
bumps with VALYCOVE early on, tracked from midpack while four wide around both turns, and failed to factor. TILL THEN vied along the inside into the first
turn, allowed the eventual winner to clear into the backstretch, stalked while shifting off of the rail, but tired into the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
HOW IRONIC rated off of the pace along the inside, swung four wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes to bid outside of FAMILY WAY approaching
the final sixteenth, brushed with that foe, and prevailed. FAMILY WAY bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the
leaders in upper stretch, awkwardly changed leads at the three sixteenths marker as HOW IRONIC ranged up alongside, bid for the lead inside of that foe
passing the furlong grounds, got brushed between rivals at the sixteenth, and was outkicked by his outer foe while achieving place. VALLETTA stalked three
wide, inched closer into the backstretch to vie for the lead outside of NAOMI BROADWAY (BRZ), drew clear of that foe approaching the furlong pole, but
was surpassed by a pair of outer foes inside the final sixteenth. WITEZ tracked from midpack two wide and from between horses, shifted inwards in upper
stretch while chasing behind the leaders, but lacked a rail surge to produce a bid. NAOMI BROADWAY (BRZ) rushed between horses early on to set the
pace, showed the way inside of VALLETTA around the far turn, but was headed by that foe in upper stretch, and weakened in midstretch. TWEETY SHOW
lied off of the pace two wide and from between horses, swung to the five path turning for home, but lacked a rally through the lane. GAMBLIN TRAIN stalked
two to three wide around the turns, and tired entering the alne. CURLY RUTH lied far off of the pace in the two path, attempted a rally five wide around the
far turn, swung to the seven path entering the lane, but failed to rally. NICENO lied off of the pace three wide around both turns, and never got involved.
QUEEN BRIDGET bumped with an outer foe at the start, saved ground from midpack, but faded through the lane. LOVING MOMENT trailed early on while
getting very rank through the lane for the first time, trailed along the inside, and never got involved. MISS IMPERFECTION tracked from midpack three wide,
but faded around the far turn, and was done early.

STAND BY YOU was bumped an bothered by an outer foe at the start, trailed the field along the inside around the turn, swung six wide turning for home
with many lengths to find, but sustained a long steady rally through the lane to bid at the sixteenth pole, and drove clear thereafter. POETIC HONOR
pressed two wide early on, chased the clear leader around the bend, then stayed on through the lane to produce a bid at the sixteenth pole as that foe
stopped, but was outkicked by an outer foe. IN A DREAM broke inwards and bumped a foe at the start, lied far off of the pace four wide around the turn, got
floated five wide entering the lane, but lugged in on his left lead through midstretch, and achieved show late. APART OF MY CHARM stalked along the
inside, shifted three wide entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer foe in midstretch, and chased mildly. HONORABLY set the pace along the inside,
widened under his own power around the turn, but noticeably tired in midstretch, and caved a sixteenth out. BEYOND A MILLION lied off of the pace in the
three path around the turn, and failed to factor. TERMSANDCONDITIONS lied forwardly placed three wide, but tired in upper stretch. SEA SONG saved
ground off of the pace, but to no avail. OUR EVA was outrun.

Footnotes
DADDY IS A LEGEND stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the clear leader into the far turn, ranged up to that foe under mild urging approaching
midstretch, forged an advantage a sixteenth out, and secured victory under steady hand urging. WINTER SUNSET cleared off while in hand through the
lane for the first time, managed a loose lead down the backstretch and around the far turn, dug in inside of DADDY IS A LEGEND passing the three
sixteenths pole while shifting off of the rail, resisted that foe through midstretch, but was headed at sixteenth grounds, then saved place. TEMPLE CITY
TERROR lied at the rear of the field two wide and from between horses around the first turn, took the far turn in the three path before shifting four wide
entering the lane, then stayed on outside of foes to claim show, but missed reaching place. OUR BAY B RUTH tracked from midpack along the inside,
advanced to stalk from the pocket into the far turn, produced a rail bid in midstretch after the leader vacated the inside, but flattened out through the final
furlong. STUNNING SKY lied off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the two path, but only managed to chased the leaders evenly through the
lane, and failed to make an impact. FROND stalked two to three wide, but chased the leaders while hanging on his left lead through upper stretch, and
faded between rivals at the furlong pole. SALLY'S CURLIN lied off of the pace three wide around the first turn, trailed into the backstretch, and never got
involved. SUMMER IN SARATOGA stumbled at the start and lost her rider, galloped around well behind the rest of the field, was caught by an outrider
around the far turn, then walked off.

Footnotes
LADY FROSTED stalked along the inside, shifted into COAL SHAFT's path entering the lane, bumped SISTER'S GHOST three times while shifting out side
of the leaders in upper stretch, ranged up to those foes at the furlong pole, and drove clear thereafter. PETTIGO GIRL dueled for the lead two wide, led in
upper stretch, but was headed by LADY FROSTED passing the furlong pole, and proved second best. VILLAGE QUEEN dueled for the lead inside of
PETTIGO, but yielded to that foe and another outer rival in upper stretch. SISTER'S GHOST pressed the dueling leaders three wide, but was bumped three
times by an inner foe while getting outkicked by that rival in upper stretch, and chased the leaders home. COAL SHAFT advanced from off of the pace to
loom from behind the leaders two wide and between horses turning for home, but steadied in tight quarters entering the lane, and faded. HAPPYLIFE lied
off of the pace in the two path around the turn, and failed to factor. MA CHERIE lied far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, raced greenly
through the lane, and failed to make an impact. LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS hesitated at the start, and was outrun. ENCHANTED ISLAND broke outwards
multiple paths, lied off of the pace three wide, but weakened after a quarter mile, was eased through the lane, and jogged across the wire before being
walked off.
