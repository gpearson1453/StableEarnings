Footnotes
RONALD DALE established a ground saving stance and exchanged command through the opening half before refusing to lose the stretch duel to REBEL
RUMBLE , who settled behind the pacesetters along the backstretch, assumed brief command through the bend and was outdueled by the eventual winner
in the final furlong. CROSSING DIXIE showed reserve down the backstretch, hugged the rail through the bend and rallied from that ground saving stance for
the show. MIGHTY BUGSY matched strides with the early pacesetters as the outermost of three abreast, was within striking distance at upper stretch, but
was unable to sustain the bid in final stages. OUR LION KING was unhurried through the opening half and lost ground to the front runners by travelling
widest of all. WOODS OF CONGAREE rushed away from the break to dispute the early pace between rivals then backed away steadily through the turn
and passed a tiring foe in final furlong. VICTORY STRIPE was rated in the second flight for the opening half and lacked a serious bid from a three path
pose.

Footnotes
JOLLY JUMPER immediately sped away from field, led every step and finished in hand for the score. JUST CHILLIN broke sharply and was the lone rival in
the second flight the entire route but forced to settle for place honors after giving chase to the runaway pacesetter and eventual winner. YOU'REOBADBOY
come under restraint shortly after the start, gave chase from a four path stance, and rallied with the best stride late to earn the show. SWEET BAKER gave
chase to a speedy pacesetter while trekking along the three path through the turn before tiring in the crucial portion of contest. AWESOME THUNDER
established a ground saving stance, maintained that path into the homestretch then lacked a rally in closing stages. JEANO rated back and was a mild
menace. EURO SUPRISE lacked a serious bid while rating mid pack. KOBE BEAN came away in an awkward manner and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
NACOGDOCHES stalked the early pace from a three wide stance, closed the gap and was on even terms with the pacesetter at upper stretch and kicked
clear in final furlong to secure the score. TOTALLY TIGER settled into mid pack along the inside in the early going, angled out near the five sixteenths pole,
rated back at the top of stretch and rallied strongly in the final furlong to earn place honors. AWESOME K P tucked behind rivals early and established a
ground saving pose, maintained that path through the bend, and rallied along the rail for the show. MUTINEER showed reserve in the early stages from a
three wide stance, was five wide at upper at upper stretch and finished with courage to improve placing in closing strides. VALID DECISION rushed from
outset to lead the field from a two path pose, was headed in upper stretch and rapidly eclipsed in final strides. CASH KITTEN settled into mid pack through
the opening half and tired in the late going. CREAKY CRICKET disputed the early pace, was unable to sustain the bid through the bend and faded in the
homestretch.

MEGA BOND stalked the pacesetting duo from a wide stance along the backstretch, closed the gap on the leaders through the turn, gained command at
upper stretch and widened the margin in the final furlong. WHO ARE YOU hustled away from outset and shared command with INTERNET EXPRESS
through the opening half, led the field through the turn but couldn't fend off the late charge of eventual winner in the homestretch. J B'S LEGACY tucked
behind rivals shortly after the start to save ground and finished evenly. INTERNET EXPRESS disputed the early pace alongside WHO ARE YOU but failed
to sustain the bid in closing stages while tiring. DELVIN TO IT settled into the two path and passed tiring foes in the late strides. ORNERY AS HELL rated
back and failed to menace while finishing under wraps. CRAFTY HEAT was well rated through the first call, got shuffled back through the bend, and faded in
the crucial portion of contest.

SAVE THE DAY showed patience while saving ground along the backstretch, was given the cue near the seven sixteenths pole, and rallied along the rail for
the victory. E TICKET RIDE rated back through the first call then earned the place by circling rivals four wide through the turn. MYSTERY STAR stalked the
pacesetter through the opening half while saving ground and was nipped for place by E TICKET RIDE. ONE RING was unhurried in opening stages,
entered the homestretch three wide and lacked a closing kick to improve placing. CHEROKEE ROSE lunged at start and trailed the field through the
opening half before passing tiring foes in the late strides. PINK PHLOX flashed early speed and led the field through the first two calls before eclipsing in the
latter portion of contest. TOURIST LIKE ME pressed the early pace as the outermost of three abreast, maintained a striking stance through the bend, then
tired in the late going. OREO GIRL faded rapidly after rating between rivals in mid pack early.
