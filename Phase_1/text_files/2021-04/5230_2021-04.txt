Footnotes
OLIVE'S BUMPA settled off the pace while saving ground, came under pressure past the three eighths, continued towards the rail entering the lane, kept on
grinding under left handed asking, drifted out late and just got up to the inside of rivals. SEVILLA SANGRIA stalked the loose leader while three wide, took
closer order past the three eighths, bid to engage soon into the lane, spurted clear under a drive in mid stretch, drifted out late and just failed to last between
foes. YOUKNOWWHATITIZZZ , taken to rate early on, edged up between runners heading towards the half mile marker, eased out, circled five wide into
the stretch and closed steadily while drifting out late. CONGRESS HALL settled four wide, was put to pressure leaving the far turn, angled and came six
wide into the stretch, advanced some past the three sixteenths but lacked the needed finish through the final furlong. LOOKIN FOR CANDY opened up
early, set the pace two wide while under a light hold, could not fend off a challenge leaving the three sixteenths, stayed willingly to about mid stretch then
weakened. WIN THEN GRIN saved ground advancing past the five eighths, angled out around the turn, pursued into the lane then faded. CAIRO QUEEN
stumbled at the break, regrouped and moved up off the rail nearing the five eighths, failed to kick on while three wide leaving the far turn and tired.
PERFECT EXCHANGE broke awkwardly and was outrun.

stretch, was floated out and just missed. DASHING LOU chased the pace outside HAYNE'S FEVER, was three deep when challenging for the lead turning
for home and weakened in the drive. WHIRLIN CURLIN lacked speed, hugged the inner rail on the far turn and failed to rally. KING MAURO , rank when

Footnotes
BIG RINNE , in range while saving ground, moved up to the inside of rivals approaching the stretch, shifted three wide entering the lane, closed under
strong handling, secured command heading towards the sixteenth marker, eagerly kicked clear then held firm while kept alert. ALADDIN SANE stalked
outside a rival, angled out leaving the three eighths, circled five wide into the lane, straightened and churned on willingly to nab the place. MARTINI LANE
took over soon after the start, set a slow pace towards the inside, spurted away two wide and under asking nearing the stretch, failed to contain the winner
approaching the sixteenth pole, weakened late and lost the place in the final jump. SHAKA STYLE , taken to rate while two wide, moved nearing the
sixteenth marker then flattened out. TALE OF DIXIE prompted the pace outside MARTINI LANE, was under pressure trying to keep up past the three
eighths, drifted out entering the lane and weakened. STAND MY GROUND lagged inside, made a mild run along the rail in upper stretch then gave way in
the last furlong. MO AMERICAN lacked speed, angled out in the drive and failed to menace.

MARDEN , sluggish early, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, rushed up outside horses, led late and drove clear. JEEZUM JIM , never far back,
raced along the inner rail in the stretch and rallied. START WITH YES saved ground around the turn, angled to the three path in mid stretch and rallied
between horses. MYSTIC TIMES chased the pace, was well positioned in the two path between horses in mid stretch and continued willingly. DAYSTRIKE ,
between horses most of the trip, raced evenly. BOURBON STREET sped to the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drifted out when sprinting clear in
mid stretch and weakened. PASCAL CHANT , a forward factor three deep around the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and weakened. BIG
HAMBONE stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide and weakened. KEEPING THE PEACE lacked speed, drifted to the eight path in upper stretch and
was no factor. BLUE DANUBE prompted the pace two wide around the turn and weakened late. INDIAN GHOST was outrun. PROUD ENOUGH was
outrun.

Footnotes
MISCHIEF AFOOT settled in the clear as a four way duel developed near the five eighths pole, eased out leaving the three eighths, made a bold run and bid
five wide outside rivals nearing the lane, came in a bit soon into the lane then drifted in bothering DINAR past the three sixteenths, straightened on a short
lead heading to the furlong grounds, wandered outward a bit when clear near the sixteenth pole, corrected and held firm under a drive. DINAR broke a step
slow, quickly recovered and edged up to contention, dropped in and tracked the embattled leaders, eased out leaving the far turn, waited a bit near the
quarter pole, bid between foes entering the lane, was forced in by the winner soon after, battled inside foes leaving the furlong grounds and continued on
gamely to reclaim the place. V. I. P. TICKET , well back while saving ground off the dueling leaders, picked up momentum then angled out near the five
sixteenths, came six wide with a run into the lane, ranged up past mid stretch, steadied briefly while floated out some by MISCHIEF AFOOT near the
sixteenth marker then was out finished late. AWESOME D J lagged well back, saved ground leaving the five sixteenths, angled out and passed faders.
SILENT MALICE bid inside rivals to gain a slim lead after a quarter mile, dueled past the five eighths, failed to keep pace nearing the five sixteenths, shifted
out in the drive and came up empty. YOUNGEST OF FIVE , three wide between foes battling past the five furlong pole, gained a slim lead leaving the far
turn, stayed on to the top of the stretch then steadied when put in close past the three sixteenths. SHOTSKI disputed the pace two wide between runners,
inherited the inside and fought on past the five sixteenths, kept on willingly to upper stretch then gave way. GENTLEMAN JOE was sent up to bid four deep
early backstretch, contested the issue outside rivals past the five sixteenths then surrendered in upper stretch. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection
by the rider of DINAR, MISCHIEF AFOOT was disqualified from first and placed second for interference in upper stretch. An objection by the rider of V.I.P.
TICKET against MISCHIEF AFOOT for alleged interference near the sixteenth pole was not allowed.

Footnotes
CAUSE TO DREAM hugged the inner rail around the turn, angled to the two path in upper stretch, split horses approaching the sixteenth pole and drew out.
TRICKY SPIRITS , never far back while two wide on the turn, angled out a bit in upper stretch and rallied between rivals. PROPER STORM lacked speed,
was four deep on the turn, floated to the seven path in upper stretch and had a slight rally outside foes. NO CHANCE GIVEN , two wide prompting the pace
around the turn, was well spotted in mid stretch and weakened late. CELESTIAL DIVA , three deep on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and
flattened out. ASBUILT , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gave way in the stretch drive. MOSLER'S TOUCH sprinted to the early lead, set the
pace along the inner rail and tired the final furlong. NO DOWN DAYS saved ground around the turn and was not a factor. SHABANG , three wide on the
turn, was not a factor. BELLATORA was outrun. FRAME THAT DAME checked and rank near the half mile pole, bore out on the turn and was eased.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF TOMORROW , rated off the rail while not far back, edged up between foes leaving the five sixteenths, angled out to the five path entering the
lane, leveled off when put to right handed asking, moved up to threaten soon past the eighth pole, overtook LARIMAR inside the sixteenth pole and drew
clear. LARIMAR prompted the pace two wide, bid between foes near the quarter pole, moved to a slim lead past the three sixteenths, maintained command
under a drive past the furlong grounds, dug in when confronted by the winner then gave way grudgingly. SKI BUNNY stalked three wide, moved up to
challenge outside rivals nearing the quarter pole, vied from the three sixteenths to mid stretch then failed to seriously continue on. REMAIN ANONYMOUS
drafted back to last soon after the start, angled in towards the rail, rated behind foes leaving the far turn, shifted out in the drive and offered a mild kick.
AWESOME PAL stalked inside, eased out under pressure into the lane, had aim in mid stretch but came up empty. BETHABARA , four wide, steadily
advanced mid turn, was fanned six wide into the lane and gave way. DOUBLE FIREBALL sped clear early, dropped in and set the pace toward the rail, was
confronted by rivals with a quarter to go, stayed willingly to the three sixteenths then retreated. SARAH'S TREASURE , between rivals while in range early,
saw the leaders get away past the three eighths and faded.

INSIGHTFUL , three deep chasing the pace leaving the backstretch, advanced in the two path approaching the stretch, bid for the lead at the head of the
lane and drew out late. SHACKABOOM sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail, lost the lead turning for home and finished willingly to hold the place.
MY WAY OR ELSE , between horses leaving the backstretch, raced well off the rail on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside
foes. GUNS BLAZING stalked the pace two wide around the turn, eased out to the four path turning for home and weakened in the drive. MAVILUS was not
a factor. KEEPYOURSKATESON was outrun. GLORY MARCH hugged the inner rail around the turn and weakened.
