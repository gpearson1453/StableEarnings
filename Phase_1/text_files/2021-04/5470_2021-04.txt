ADDY'S LOVE stalked the early pace from the outside, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, drew to even terms midway on the turn and had
the lead into the lane, then dug in under steady handling to inch clear later yards. MEET MS BOBBI RAE was urged clear and rated the early pace, came
under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met at the rail midway on the turn, continued close through most of the stretch but relented later yards.
BELLA FEMMINA stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the turn off the rail and ran evenly through the lane.
SPUNKY ALI CAT stalked the early pace inside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the turn and weakened.

SILKEN BELLE took quick control and rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and
was steadily handled to hold on well. CASTLE OF CAYLEE rated close two deep the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn about the three path and finished well to close the gap. SENSE OF MUSIC raced in the three path the first turn and left the turn outside, bid nearing
the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the four path then flattened inside the eighth pole. GARY DOING BIZ stalked the earlier pace then
challenged nearing the three eighths pole, raced close through the backstretch but dropped back at the rail on the far turn and weakened into the lane.
WATERLOO ROSE came through the opening turn in the three path and settled off the pace entering the backstretch, though, showed little response.
KEYED UP rated close to the early pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole but faded into the far turn.

ISHIHARA stalked inside then bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced close through the far turn then dug in determinedly at the rail through the stretch to
take the lead a sixteenth away and was inching further ahead of REMYS SHOWTIME, who closed to the lead at the thirteen sixteenths pole and rated the
pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the advantage off the rail through the far turn but was caught mid-stretch and
reluctantly ceded later yards. GOLDEN APPEAL raced in the three path the opening turn then stalked into the backstretch, started a bid past the seven
sixteenths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage about the three path of the far turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement and just lasted in third.
RIDING CLOUD NINE came through the first turn in the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, continued in the
four path of the far turn, dug in down the lane and just missed third. NORTHERN RIDGE was through after a half mile. CHOCO ROCO never factored.

eased out into the backstretch, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, was carried to the seven path on the far turn, steadily progressed down the lane to take
third the final strides and was gaining on the runner-up. EXECUTIVE RETREAT rated close inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced
close at the rail on the far turn, dug in a factor through the stretch but flattened in the final strides. MARU'S RAVEN saved early ground then bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, angled to the six path rounding the far turn and finished well. SUNBRIDLED stalked inside the first turn, bid toward the seven
sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then showed little more. BYEBYE BYEBYE settled back in the two and three paths the first turn, started
a bid toward the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn then flattened stride the final furlong. EDDY DIRT raced in the five path the first turn,

THUNDER THIGHS gave chase and rounded the turn near the rail, came just outside Fullmoon Bay to take over past the sixteenth pole, drew briefly clear
then held on well. LINEAGE chased outside and raced five wide on the turn, dug in leaving the turn to take second the final yards and was gaining on the
winner. MISS OREILEY engaged in close chase and dueled to even terms two deep midway on the turn, drifted a bit into the stretch then flattened stride
later yards. FULLMOON BAY took over nearing the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, was met
midway through the turn, gave up the lead inside the sixteenth pole then flattened later yards. DOMS LADY chased from the inside, rounded the turn at the
rail and finished well. SWEET PIPER chased and rounded the turn about the three path, ran evenly through the stretch but flattened in later yards.

Footnotes
RAELYN'S STAR settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and drew to even terms past the quarter pole,
then dug in determinedly to take the nod from ORTINOLA, while that one stalked two deep the first turn and moved to even terms into the backstretch,
dueled from that point and contested even terms through the far turn, dug in gamely to the finish but ultimately gave up the nod. DEVILISH BEAUTY rated
close inside the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and dueled at a close disadvantage near the rail through the far turn, eased out
in the upper stretch and was along to take third the final strides. HONORABLE LILLY drew clear and angled to the inside to rate the pace, was met into the
backstretch and dueled from that point, raced at even terms near the rail on the far turn and remained close to late stretch, but gave way to the top three
nearing the wire. LIES AND SCANDALS entered the first turn in the four path then moved to even terms three wide into the backstretch, dueled from the
three eighths pole but dropped back nearing the quarter and weakened on the far turn. ESTHER'S FORTUNE saved ground well off the pace the first turn,
eased out into the backstretch, showed little response and came through the far turn about the five path. SECRET CASTLE bobbled from the gate and
settled back inside, showed little response through the backstretch and ran in the four path of the far turn.

Footnotes
BELLOWS raced in the five path the first turn and settled just off the pace, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the six
path, was carried wider approaching the top of the stretch but dug in under steady encouragement to take over inside the sixteenth pole and edged out
MARYLANDER to the wire, while the latter rated close about the three path then dueled from the three eighths pole to take the lead three wide past the
quarter, drifted a bit nearing the head of the lane, was caught inside the sixteenth pole and reluctantly ceded. ENVISION SUCCESS came through the
opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, started a bid approaching the three eighths, was eased to the six path on
the far turn, angled in past the eighth pole and raced close to mid-stretch, then flattened stride. THE WAYNE FACTOR settled off the pace toward the
inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole but steadied to the inside of Envision Success in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, recovered stride and
angled to the eight path on the far turn but showed little more. KATMAN QUICK rated close through the first turn then took the lead between horses past the
half mile pole, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, was caught beyond the quarter pole, continued close in the upper stretch, though, weakened
the final sixteenth. THREE TO THIRTEEN showed little response through the backstretch. BANISHMENT came through the opening turn in the five path
and took the lead approaching the seven eighths pole, was caught past the half, gave close chase from that point then weakened from the middle of the far
turn. MY EMINENCE raced off the pace about the three path, gave chase from the three eighths pole then faded nearing the far turn.
