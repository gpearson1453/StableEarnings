Footnotes
DAVE showed good speed from the inside to clear his rivals early in the turn and open a daylight lead then held the margin through the lane.
THEBOYZDELIGHT contested the early lead three wide but could not go with the winner the final quarter. COLD SNACK THIRTY rallied inside rivals
through the turn and continued to close in the lane. BETA CAPO SONG was four and five wide in the turn and had no closing bid. MY PERFECT
GRAYDAR was three and four wide and could not close the gap in the lane. STOCKED went evenly three and four wide. FREE MUSIC saved ground and
was not a threat.

Footnotes
NATTYTYME stalked the dueling leaders two or three wide, bid four wide nearing the lane and was narrowly up at the wire. WILD DRIVE broke inward,
soon joined EL DIABLO GRANDE to duel outside that one on the pace, continued well in the lane but could not keep the winner safe. KING OF ANYTHING
stalked the pace in good position inside but lacked a final closing run. EL DIABLO GRANDE dueled on the lead inside WILD DRIVE and weakened in the
drive. GOODWILLAMBASSADOR was shuffled back at the break, trailed and was eased through deep stretch.

Footnotes
BARTENDERS MISTAKE was last away and dropped back off the early pace, moved closer going to the far turn, angled four wide through that bend to bid
into the lane and slowly edged clear late. YE BE JUDGED forced the pace between rivals early, bid to edge clear into the lane then could not contain the
winner late. YAYASGOTMOREGAME moved up inside and briefly awaited room along the rail nearing the lane then could not produce the needed late rally.
KENHEDOIT was on the pace inside rivals to the far turn and weakened nearing the lane. CHARED was with the lead group three or four wide to the far
turn and tired. RAGTOP RED was not a factor. CREEDS REVENGE chased the leaders four or five wide and tired.

Footnotes
LIBERTY FLIES tracked the pace three and four wide to bid through the far turn, came out slightly midstretch but held clear under steady handling.
UNPLUCKED GEM stalked the early leader three wide, angled four wide in the turn to make a mild bid outside the winner but could not run that one down.
The rider of UNPLUCKED GEM lodged a claim of foul against the winner alleging interference in the stretch run which was not allowed. DIDI MCCURDY
moved to a clear lead along the inside, made the running to the far turn and weakened some in the lane. SEIZE IT saved ground and moved up through the
lane while not a serious threat late. TEXAS FUGITIVE stalked the pace four wide and lacked a solid bid. FANCY GI GI failed mount a rally three wide.
NEBRASKA RED followed the pace along the inside and weakened. OUR LADY BLING was not a threat. DESTINY'S EMPIRE trailed.

Footnotes
UNFADING BEAUTY stalked the early leaders four wide, rallied six wide into the lane to bid and drew off under steady handling. DEJA SUE prompted the
pace three and four wide outside NURSE LIST to bid into the lane then could not go with the winner while holding the place late. NURSE LIST moved to the
front along the inside on a short lead, was headed into the lane and continued evenly to just miss the place. DIXIE DELTA moved up three wide into the
lane and closed some ground but could not reach the top ones. LIL MISS DE BUY saved ground just off the early pace and weakened. IZE DISCREET
ROSE moved up two and three wide but lacked a solid closing bid. MISS PHOTO was five and six wide through the first turn, settled four wide and had no
rally. FINAL AFFAIR saved ground and was not a threat. SWEATY BETTY tired racing four wide.

HYPER DRIVE tracked the early leaders three wide to bid going to the far turn, moved clear and drew off under steady handling. ASTUTE WARRIOR was
five wide in the first turn, moved up four wide into the lane and continued on to gain the place. BEAR TRAPPE dropped back early, moved up four and five
wide and was up late for the show. BIG HEARTED FACTOR moved up three wide, angled in going to the far turn and continued to just miss in the photo for
minor honors. GREEN CARD tracked the early leaders four wide, moved to challenge in late backstretch then drifted some in the lane and lost position.
SPOTITUDE tucked inside going to the first turn, moved three wide on the far turn and had no rally. TAYLOR'S PRINCE showed speed inside to contest the
pace to the far turn and had nothing left. WILLOWY DANSEUR tired three wide. FERRARI ROAD chased the pace three or four wide and tired.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY JOKE settled three wide in reach of the pace, moved four wide to challenge going up the backstretch, dueled outside PANIC BUTTON through
the far turn into the lane and gamely got past that one late. PANIC BUTTON settled inside to track the leaders, bid with the winner going up the backstretch,
dueled that one the remainder and narrowly missed. GOLD NOTE settled off the pace three or four wide, rallied five wide into the lane and closed but was
too late. BREAK FREE tracked the early leaders four wide and weakened into the lane. RENVYLE was five and six wide out of the first and second turn,
settled four wide and moved up late while not a threat. BANANA PEPPER was with the early pace four wide and weakened in the final turn.
THEBOYFROMJERSEY was on the pace three wide for six furlongs and came up empty into the lane. SMOKIN B saved ground in reach of the pace and
tired. AFFIX was always back. DAY DREAMER followed the pace three or four wide and tired.
