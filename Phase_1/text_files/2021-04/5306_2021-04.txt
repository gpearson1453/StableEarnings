MANDREW was allowed to settle early, raced seven wide through the second turn, took control in mid stretch and edged clear. NONNO'S POLARIS
tracked the early pace, raced six wide into the second turn, took control at the quarter pole, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best.
ESTEEMED was unhurried early, went five wide into the second turn, angled out in early stretch and was along for third. JU JU GUY was void of any early
speed, raced four wide through the second turn and offered no rally. LITTLE BUBS chased the early pace, went five wide into the second turn and
weakened. TURNTHECLOCKTOZERO set a clear early pace, went four wide into both turns and faded.
