Footnotes
KAT'S HITMAN in the second flight off the rail and between horses, moved closer to chase the leader past the furlong marker, challenged inside that same
rival late, proved best while fully extended. ROLL DINERO ROLL bumped, bothered at the start, quickly recovered to move up and show the way into the
turn, clear through the bend and into the stretch, continued to show the way past the furlong marker while getting out a bit, responded when challenged by
the winner after that and gave ground grudgingly to that foe, remained well clear for the place. RISKY SITUATION broke back, void of speed, asked a bit for
room into the turn, improved through the bend, in traffic and four wide turning for home, finished willingly midtrack to be up for the show. STORM CLASSIC
forwardly placed outside, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, went evenly through the stretch, lacked a late punch and was nipped for the show at the
wire. LOU'S ARROW broke to the inside, raced in the second flight just off the inside early, saved some ground late in the bend, also came up empty for the
stertch run. HEROS R COWBOYS raced back early along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, failed to muster a response when called on
for the drive. MY FORTUNATE SON bothered when steadied early, raced back, two path through the turn, checked up in traffic late in the bend, made little
impact after recovering through the stretch. MOONSHINE MOMENT in mid pack while racing outside, four out to five wide turn, failed to rally. PURE IRON
shied and veered out sharply at the break to spot the field a few lengths, continued back, four out to five wide turn, failed to rally. NO CUSSING checked up
sharply in traffic the opening furlong, remained in mid pack through the turn, backed up through the stretch. ROCKET CORREDOR bothered at the start and
was bumped, steadied in traffic with five furlongs to run, stopped abruptly late in the turn, jogged in late.

Footnotes
PAYNTER PARTY allowed the pace to go early, settled three wide, bothered slightly midway up the backstretch by a stricken SEA OF HOPE halfway up the
backstretch, continued three wide into and three wide through the final turn, roused for the drive, closed with good resolve to be up in time. HANDY lacked
speed while three wide through the first turn, four wide through the second turn, rallied to be easily in time for the place, getting to the winner as well in the
late going. MY BOY GUS broke alertly, dueled past the wire the first time, dropped toward the inside when clear midway on the first turn, showed the way up
the backstretch, shrugged off a pursuing rival turning for home, clear again a furlong out, folded quickly ni the late going to lose the first two positions.
DRAW THE LINE off a step slow, raced back, saved some ground through the second turn, went evenly on in to make little impact. TURN THE SWITCH
settled off the inside, inherited the second position when SEA OF HOPE was being pulled up, crept closer to the leader midway on the second turn then
faltered in the drive. JACKS FIRE BALLS void of speed, was slammed off stride and knocked into the rail by SEA OF HOPE as that one was falling midway
up the backstretch, was pulled up soon after, walked in. SEA OF HOPE a bit rank when contesting the issue midway on the first turn, chased the leader
onto the backstretch, shortened stride and was being pulled up when he fell into JACKS FIRE BALLS with just over a half mile remaining, bled, regained his
footing afterward, walked onto the van. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE INCIDENT ON THE BACKSTRETCH, THE RESULT
WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
TYCOON dwelt at the start, continued well back, circled four wide into contention out of the turn, quickly reached the leader with a further burst of
acceleration nearing midstretch, rapidly drew clear, geared down late to win ridden out. WE BE THERE off a step slow, moved in to save some ground turn,
two path into the lane, moved out a bit further when rallying for the second spot, up late for that position while not a threat to the winner. MASTER KEV
away in good order, soon sprinted well clear through a rapid opening quarter, continued to hold a sizable advantage through the turn, offered little resistance
to the winner just inside the furlong marker, weakened late, caught in the final strides for the place. STUD PUPPY settled off the pace, saved some ground
into the lane, improved position a bit in the run to the wire without posing a serious threat. SUPER BROTHER went evenly paced throughout while racing
three wide. STREET TOLL made little impact while racing three wide. INTHEALY chased the leader for a half in the two path then gave way in the drive.
ASH FLAT off the pace and the inside, three to four wide through the turn, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
BEAR OAK away in good order, vied into the first turn closest to the inside, got clear late in that bend, continued to show the way up the backstretch and
into the far turn, responded when the runner up came alongside midway on the second bend, headed into the lane, dug in late to come back in a game
effort. CABERTOSS forwardly placed while three wide early, stalked up the backstretch, moved up to challenge outside the winner in the second turn,
showed the way past the furlong marker, outkicked in the late going. UNCLE GREGORY broke alertly, raced within striking distance while just off the inside,
fell back the middle half, staged a mild rally to annex the show. ALLEN back off the pace while toward the inside, three wide into the lane when moving a bit
closer, flattened out and lacked a late punch. DERBY CODE five wide into the first turn, four wide through most of that bend, continued outside, four down to
three wide in the second turn, went evenly through the stretch. TAPALIST lacked speed, four wide in the second turn, was not dangerous in the drive while
remaining out in the strip. HAVE A PLAN last away, trailed early, pulled while remaining back into the far turn while saving ground, improved into the lane,
failed to sustain that advance in the drive, faltered to lose some position the final furlong. CARTE BLANCHE lacked early speed, continued to race back into
the far turn, checked up in tight quarters, remained back. MAJESTIC JOHN'S forwardly placed while four wide through the first turn, gave way after a half,
trailed home.

Footnotes
ENGLANDER broke alertly, pressed the early leader from the outside, dueled into and through the far turn, drifted out when holding a narrow advantage
past the furlong marker, drove well clear llyate. FAY DAN showed the way into the first turn along the inside, rated while continuing to set the pace up the
backstretch, dueled with the winner through the final turn inside that one, proved no match late, remained well clear for the place. MEGA MAX one paced
behind the leaders inside, continued to save ground, roused for the drive, could do little with the top pair in the drive, prevailed for the show. HEROIC SONG
off a step slow, raced back, four wide turning into the stretch, improved position, not enough for the show. POWER BURST also off slowly, void of speed
while rank in the first turn, improved into the lane, flattened out in the final furlong to finish up evenly. PIZZA CHARLIE chased the two leaders off the inside
for six furlongs, weakened in the drive. MURDO off a step slow, four wide into the first turn, remained always back. FIXATION finished after half, continued
to stop, distanced after losing contact with the field through the stretch, jogged in.

Footnotes
CANDURA forwardly placed up the backstretch, advanced and squeezed through along the rail to take command early in the turn, shook clear when
straightened for home and held a comfortable advantage late under steady handling. BREAK CURFEW settled in mid pack while racing outside, three wide
through the turn, set down for the drive, finished willingly outside to be in time for the place. CROWN JEWEL broke out a bit, was straightened and
prompted the pace off the inside, continued to press 3w into and through the turn, lacked a winning response in the drive, outkicked for the place.
DRINKATTHECREEK behind the pace while just off the inside, lacked clear room behind the first flight into the lane, clear for the drive, finished up evenly.
MISS ANTIOCH off the pace and the inside, four wide through the turn, came up empty when called on for the drive. FINAL FORM broke with leaders, set
the early pace in the two path, allowed the winner the inside into the turn, chased that one into and through upper stretch then weakened final furlong. LAY
M OUT last to leave, trailed much of the way and was never a threat. CYNICAL GIRL was finished early, far back.

Footnotes
WILD COMBO broke well, raced forwardly and outside, came three wide into the lane to lose some ground to the winner into the stretch, late surge outside
to win going away. LIVINGMYBESTLIFE close from the start off the inside, dueled into the lane while remaining in the two path, put a head in front nearing
the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner in the late going. LOFTHOUSE away in good order, took command soon after, showed the way into the
turn by daylight, dueled into and through upper stretch, proved stubborn til late, well clear of the others. CHURCH SERVICE broke inward and near the
back, lacked speed, three wide into the lane, staged a mild rally to improve position, not a serious threat. MAKING PROGRESS lacked speed, encountered
some traffic while racing just off the inside early in the turn, improved slightly in the stretch while also not posing a serious threat. SHE'SSKYSTHELIMIT
within striking distance while inside, continued to save ground behind the leaders through the turn, lacked a closing response when called on for the drive.
SHES GOT IT in the second flight while racing off the inside, had little left for the drive. I'M STYLIN void of speed while racing outside, four out to five wide
late in the turn, no rally. BEAUTY CONTEST off a step slow, raced back and off the inside, 5w into the stretch, no response. VIVA VIOLENCE in the main
body along the inside, shuffled back while along the rail into the turn, continued to fade stretch. SUPER STEAMY was finished early while racing four wide.

Footnotes
W W FITZY took control soon after the start, clear late in the first turn,rated ikn the run up the backstretch, shook off the runner up turning for home, kicked
well clear. SINGITA DREAMS settled early, moved closer before a half in the three path, briefly tried the winner from the outside midway on the final turn,
proved no match for that one in the drive, remained clear for the place. FIRE CORAL forwardly placed while racing off the inside, prompted the winner into
the far turn, went evenly from there to the wire while reaming off the rail to report home best of the rest. ALTA'S AWARD fell back to lag well off the early
pace, continued bac the middle half, improved position through some traffic stretch after the issue had been decided. SARA SEA pressed early inside the
winner, fell back before four furlongs while in some traffic into the far turn, had little left for the drive. JOSIE last away, pulled early, in the second flight while
three wide through most of the final turn, had nothing for the drive. SHE'S ALL WOLFE was never a threat while racing four wide through much of the final
turn.

Footnotes
INCORRIGIBLE with the pace from the start inside, salted away the other speed into the far turn, drew strongly clear through the stretch under an
aggressive hand ride. REINSURE forwardly placed from the start outside, prompted the pace four wide through the first turn, continued to race within
striking distance on the outside in the run up the backstretch, three wide through the second turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, held sway for
the place. GEORGIA DEPUTY settled off the pace while saving ground, continued along the inside into the far turn, steered out three wide turning for home
when rallying, slowly getting to the runner up late. DAY TRIP in the main body while racing four wide through the first turn, remained outside, five down to
four wide through the second turn, improved slightly while going in even fashion through the stretch. ASTROLOGER raced in mid pack while off the inside,
three wide most of the way, also went one paced through the stretch. SHAKE IT off a step slow, trailed well back, dropped inside for the second turn,
improved position by passing mostly tiring rivals. ROGALLO within striking distance, fell back just off the inside before a half and failed to menace.
PERFECT MISTAKE three wide trip most of the way, remained back in lacking a closing response. BIG BIZ in the second flight after moving off the inside,
four wide through the second turn, tired in the drive. WINGS UP was never involved. HARD TO PARK off a step slow, five wide into the first turn, moved
inside, was always outrun. CRITIC broke alertly, dueled up front in the two path outside the winner, stopped badly midway on the final turn, fell, hit rail after
wire, returned to his feet afterward and was vanned off after walking onto the van under his own power.
