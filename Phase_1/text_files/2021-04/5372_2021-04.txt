Footnotes
MCKENZIE HONEY drew clear and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure past the half mile pole and widened off the rail through the
far turn, then proved best under steady stretch handling. THE MALLARD QUEEN settled off the pace in the three and four paths, started a bid leaving the
half mile pole, ran in the six path of the far turn then dueled through the stretch for second. PULPIT SINGER stalked the leader two deep, picked up the
chase leaving the half mile pole and raced well off the rail through the far turn, was then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. STELLA SWEEPER
rounded the opening turn in the five path and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
BIG ENOUGH settled well off the early pace and off the rail the opening turn, started a bid leaving the half mile pole and raced in the five path of the far turn,
then dug in under steady encouragement through the lane to get up the final yards. WILLING TO BURN settled just off the pace while racing well off the rail,
bid nearing the three eighths pole and moved alongside Billy K toward the quarter pole, dueled to the front approaching the three sixteenths, dug in under
determined handling and drew clear in the deep going, but was caught the final yards. BILLY K raced in the five path the first turn and took the lead past the
three quarter pole, drew clear toward the half, came under pressure into the far turn but was headed nearing the top of the lane then flattened the final
sixteenth. LUCKY STEPPER rated a short lead inside, was caught past the three quarter pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back toward the
half mile pole and faded on the far turn. NAVARONES SPARKLE raced off the pace outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the half mile
pole, came through the far turn about the five path and showed little more. MORE SMORES settled just off the pace the opening turn, faded through the
backstretch and was not asked the final three eighths.

NEVADAN engaged in close chase through the backstretch and took the lead at the five sixteenths pole, drifted a bit toward the head of the lane but dug in
to race clear past the three sixteenths and was steadily handled to turn back the stretch effort of GREAT ULYSSES, who chased well off the rail and
rounded the turn about the five path, dug in a close factor from the head of the lane but was turned back through later yards. CATS SURFIN gave chase
from the outside, raced in the six path of the turn and finished evenly. BUCKYS PICK chased and rounded the turn about the three path then passed some
rivals in an even finish. SON OF ELEANOR pressured the pace toward the inside but dropped back into the turn and flattened stride the final furlong.
PASSING was a bit reluctant to load then hustled along to set a pressured pace, gave up the lad at the five sixteenths pole but remained close through the
turn before weakening.

four wide into the stretch, dug in to recover a slim, brief late lead, but was nipped the final strides. CASEY'S DADDY chased outside and took the lead five
wide midway on the turn, dueled with the edge to the eighth pole but was met and relented the final yards. UNCONSCIOUS POWER took a quick early lead
to set a pressured pace, was headed at the seven sixteenths pole, continued in close chase after the rider lost the whip in the vicinity of the quarter pole,
dueled at even terms most of the stretch, was caught leaving the sixteenth pole then flattened stride later yards. CURBSIDE PICKUP gave chase and raced
near the rail on the turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. APPEALINGLY EASY chased, was eased to the seven path nearing the head of the
stretch and ran evenly outside down the lane. ROUGE SUNSET pressured the pace between horses and took a slim brief lead at the seven sixteenths pole,
was caught past the three eighths, raced close through the turn but dropped back into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. RENEGADE CHIEF raced
well back and lacked speed.

SUITE ALONSO gave chase toward the outside, raced in range of the lead in the four path of the turn then dug in through the lane to get up the final yards.
ONE SALTY DOG chased outside and raced in the six path of the turn, dueled to the front a furlong away, was outfinished in the final yards but held on for
second. STANLEY RYDER chased outside, rounded the turn about the seven path, finished well and was gaining on the waning runner-up. FIGHT ME
chased toward the inside, rounded the turn off the rail and ran evenly to mid-stretch before flattening stride. PAITASKA lacked speed through the
backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and ran evenly down the lane. SUNLAND STAR was only briefly close then faded past the five sixteenths
pole. RUNNERATTHECORNER took a quick early lead and set a clear pace, kept the advantage closest to the rail on the turn, but was caught a furlong
away and weakened. RIVER NORTH gave chase then faded past the five sixteenths pole.

FOUR SCORE engaged in close chase toward the outside and drew to near even terms past the quarter pole, dug in under determined handling from that
point and took the nod the final strides. RUN FOR BELLE was hustled along to set a pressured pace, raced clear through the turn, dug in gamely to the
challenge of Four Score leaving the turn, though, grudgingly relented the final strides. I'M ALL THE JEDI gave chase racing well off the rail, angled to the
seven path through the turn then dug in to take third inside the sixteenth pole. EMERALD CITY pressured the pace inside through the backstretch but
dropped back midway on the turn and weakened the final furlong. DR. MINISTER engaged in close chase outside down the backstretch, rounded the turn
about the five path then flattened the final furlong. COPLA chased outside, rounded the turn about the eight path then weakened in the lane. MAGIC
HUSSAR raced well back and saved ground on the turn. KEY MONEY was hustled along with the early pace but dropped back leaving the three eighths
pole and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
BIG ENDEAVOR stalked through the backstretch then bid leaving the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms between horses in the five path of the turn,
dropped back entering the stretch but dug in under determined handling to take the nod the final strides. BULL HOLLOW raced just off the pace outside
down the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms in the six path of the turn, and while outfinished in the stretch long duel
for the win, was just up for second under the wire. WAKE UP CALL stalked the early pace and drew to even terms past the nine sixteenths pole, contested
at a close disadvantage through the turn, dueled clear into the stretch, dug in under steady stretch encouragement, but was caught in the final yards and
reluctantly ceded. NEVER EASY settled off the pace toward mid track, came through the turn about the five path, angled to the outside entering the stretch
and passed rivals in an even finish. YHA YHA settled off the pace, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the turn then flattened
the final sixteenth. THE METAL MAN hopped from the gate and raced off the pace through the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced in
range about the five path of the turn but showed little further. BIG BUFFY took over on the chute and rated the early pace, was met leaving the nine
sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back at the five sixteenths and weakened the final furlong. EMPIRE'S SHADOW broke a step
slow, showed no speed and was eased from the three eighths pole.

Footnotes
AVALON KING surged clear and angled in early then rated the pace well off the rail, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the
four path of the far turn, was headed into the lane but dug in determinedly to inch out the game effort of VINTAGE KITTEN, who rounded the opening turn
about the three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the nine sixteenths pole, steadily progressed off the rail on the far
turn, dug in gamely at the rail through the stretch but needed just a bit more. MORE THAN A. P. was crowded early and settled off the pace, started a bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close in the five path of the far turn, dug in through the lane and finished well. DREADNAUGHT was crowded early
and rounded the opening turn about the six path, raced outside into the backstretch, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and came through the far turn in the
three path, dug in from the head of the lane and finished well. MASTER RECOVERY was crowded early and settled back through the opening turn, bid
nearing the three eighths pole, was carried to the eight path approaching the top of the stretch but closed well down the lane. GO FOR A RIDE raced in the
three and four paths the opening turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
just off the rail then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. MY GOLDEN BOY raced off the pace and well off the rail, gave chase from the half mile pole,
angled to the seven path nearing the head of the lane and showed little further. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Avalon King for
interference leaving the gate, lodged by the rider of Master Recovery, though, took no action.
