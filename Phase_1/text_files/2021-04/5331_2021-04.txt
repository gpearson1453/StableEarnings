Footnotes
ITS MY BAG BABY broke on top, showed the way into and through the first turn just off the inside, continued to set the pace through some moderate
fractions, set down for the drive, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. SPIN RATE briefly vied inside the winner past the wire the first time,
allowed that one to go before a quarter, prompted that same rival the middle half while saving all the ground, briefly boxed when creeping closer late in the
second turn on the rail, tipped out for the drive, could not get to the winner to the wire, clearly second best. TURN THE SWITCH restless in the gate, broke a
bit back, settled well off the pace inside, continued to save ground far turn, angled out sharply to be three wide into the lane, rallied to be clear of the others
while not a threat to the runner up. FAST RECOVERY within striking distance while four wide through the first turn, moved a bit closer off the inside second
turn, lacked a further response to finish up evenly. ASSUMPTION last away, raced back, fanned five wide when called on for some run turning for home,
lacked a closing punch. GEORGIA DEPUTY broke back, was never a menace while racing outside. FOXY ACE settled off the pace and the inside, retreated
through the stretch. SPEAKEROFTHEHOUSE within striking distance, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
JANET'S ROCKET broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, remained just off the inside turn, well clear past the furlong marker,
enough left to hold the next two at bay in the final strides to gain the nod. LIFE OF SATURDAYS off a step slow, advanced two out to three wide through the
turn, steered out a bit further when straightened for home, finished willingly to narrowly miss while widest of the first flight. TALLANDLONG forwardly placed
while racing off the inside, three wide into the lane, late bid while between the top two at the wire, also narrowly missed. MOONSHINE PRINCESS in the
second flight while racing out in the strip, four wide turn, bothered slightly by the runner up when that one steered out upper stretch, finished up evenly.
MERLIN'S SISTER off a step slow, raced back and toward the inside, angled out three wide turning for home, improved position while not a serious threat.
JERI DAWN settled off the pace and the inside, three wide through the turn, continued one paced through the stretch. MISS CHECKMARK back off the
pace, moved to the inside by midway on the turn, failed to muster a rally when called on for the stretch run. HEART TO BREAK remained back in failing to
threaten. PRINCESS STRATEGY pressured the winner from along the inside for three furlongs and began to give way, two path into the lane, continued to
fade. MORNING VALENTINE in mid pack and off the inside, was finished early.

Footnotes
COACH ADAMS prompted the leader from the outside up the backstretch, took over from that one midway on the turn, clear into the lane, kept to task late
to hold the runner safe late. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER within striking distance well off the inside, steered out to mid track for the drive, steadily getting to the
winner late, well clear of the others. CEEKY in the second flight toward the inside, moved out a bit far turn, in some traffic late in the turn, clear for the drive,
up late for the show while closest to the inside of the second flight. KID'S MISCHIEF last away, trailed up the backstretch, shifted out midstretch, missed
show. JOHNNY OBVIOUS within striking distance while widest, four wide exiting the turn, lacked a late punch to lose the show late. PLEASE THE COURT
remained back in failing to muster a closing response. DRIVEN TO COMPETE broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch, gave way when headed
by the winner in the turn.

Footnotes
BATTLE HERO broke sharp, pressed up the backstretch off the inside, moved up to duel through the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, held the
runner up comfortably safe under steady handling while well out in the strip. AMERICAN UNITY broke back, settled off the the pace and the inside, came
four wide out of the turn, set down, slowly getting to the winner late, clearly second best. GALILEE within striking distance just off the inside, angled three
wide and inside the runner up into the lane, lacked a closing punch. NEW DICE went one paced while racing off the inside, also came up empty for the
stretch run. DEE BO broke well, set the early pace while along the inside, gave way when headed by the winner midway on the turn. PRESTO BENCH
lacked speed, three wide off the inside, failed to menace. MAVERICK MAN saved ground to no avail while also remaining back. ENGLISH COLONY
restless in the gate, in tight when off slowly, trailed throughout in showing little.

WICKED STREET in the second flight while racing off the inside, advanced on the leader entering the stretch from the outside, wore that one down to be
clear late all the while under steady handling. ROSE MARIE B within striking distance outside, four wide through the turn, set down for the drive, could not
get to the winner late, fully extended to prevail for the place. SAILAWAY AND HIDE back off the early pace and the inside, three wide early turn, swung out
to be five wide for the drive, finished with good energy to be getting to the runner up late. VERY SPICY broke toward the front, dueled off the inside into the
turn, shook off the other speed to be clear late in the turn, continued to show the way upper stretch, briefly responded when the winner challenged past the
furlong marker, weakened late to lose a couple of additional positions late. HAMAZING LACE settled off the pace and the inside, three wide though much of
the turn, continued one paced through the lane to finish up evenly. NATURAL JEWEL off a step slow, raced back and inside, advanced along the rail turn,
steadied behind horses entering the stretch, moved out a bit, lost crop a furlong out, finished up evenly. EMERALDS R US forwardly placed early along the
inside, in traffic, waited, moved out, lacked a closing response to also go one paced through the lane. SWEET HOLINESS pinched to be off slowly,
remained back, three wide turn, failed to menace. SKADI broke sharp, cleared toward the inside in the run up the backstretch, gave way in the turn,
continued to fade through the stretch. ANGEL ARKIE broke in, was finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
IMPRESSED void of early foot, closer into turn, three wide through most of the bend, traffic into lane, hit an open seam nearing the furlong grounds,
challenged four wide and widest of the first flight with less than an eighth remaining, edged clear. TRASHTALKINYANKEE in the second flight while outside,
four wide through the turn, five wide into the stretch, lost some ground to the winner as a result, could not get to that one in the late going. NO SHIRT NO
SHOES with the pace outside, vied three wide through the turn, narrowly showed the way past midstretch, could not match the top two, lasted for the show.
CAVE RUN behind the pace off the rail, moved toward the inside late in the turn, improved position. VICE VERSA broke with the field, contested the issue
up front along the inside, continued on equal terms with the other speed into the lane, weakened. KADRI behind the pace under a snug hold into the turn,
three wide through the bend, came four wide into the stretch, lacked a closing kick to finish up evenly. GRAY ATTEMPT set or forced the pace while
between horses for a half, faltered in the drive. SHAKES CREEK off a step slow, was never a factor. CODETOWIN in the second group toward the rail for
four furlongs, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
STILLETO BOY away in good order, showed the way in the two path through the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, shook clear when
straightened for home then held the runner up at bay the final furlong while kept to pressure. CRYO broke well, pressured the winner early in the three path,
continued top apply pressure to that one the the middle half, tried a brief bid from the outside second turn, fell back off that same foe into the lane, could not
get back to the front, clearly second best. RIGHT TONE in the second flight off the inside, closest to the top two up the backstretch, headed for the third slot
turning for home, came back for that position while not a serious threat to the top two late. W W CRAZY last away, moved up to mid pack toward entering
the first turn, steered out to be three wide onto the backstretch, stalked in the second group, crept a bit closer three to four wide turning for home, flattened
out in the drive. MY FAVORITE UNCLE lacked early foot when four wide into the first turn, dropped in a bit to be three wide onto backstretch, continued
three wide through the second bend, failed to muster a serious closing response. ENID settled inside, continued to save ground throughout, also finished up
one paced in lacking a meaningful closing response. PA MA'S AMOS fractious in the gate, fell back to trail after the start, was never involved. JAMES
MADISON finished early, fell back, trailed home to be well beaten.

Footnotes
SILVER STATE unhurried early while toward the inside, began to move on the lead pack midway on the final turn, steered out four wide turning into the
lane, challenged on the outside past the furlong marker, proved best in the late going under firm handling. FEARLESS tracked the pace while along the
inside, also raced under patient handling, traffic into the lane, slipped up the inside to challenge also with a furlong remaining, outkicked to the wire while
holding sway for the place. EXPRESS TRAIN pressed the leader into the first turn inside, picked up and moved out midway that bend, prompted the pace
up the backstretch off the inside, challenged between horses turning for home, gave ground grudgingly to the top two in the final furlong. OWENDALE
lacked early foot, continued to race reserved in the run up the backstretch off the inside, advanced midway on the final turn, fanned five wide into the lane,
lodged a mild bid nearing midstretch then was outkicked in the run to the wire. WARRIOR'S CHARGE lunged prior to the start, broke on top, worked way
clear by midway on the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch under light restraint, continued to vie into the lane, allowed the runner up the rail
nearing midstretch, weakened from between horses in the late going. SILVER PROSPECTOR within striking distance in the second flight early, continued to
stalk three wide the middle half mile, moved closer and lodged a bid three wide into the lane, hung the final furlong to lose several positions. GUEST SUITE
void of speed in trailing most of the way, came in the two path for the drive, picked off one tiring rival while never seriously involved. RATED R SUPERSTAR
lacked speed in the three path, continued to race outside, fanned six wide exiting the final turn, came up empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
SEVEN NATION ARMY pushed out, bothered soon after the start, recovered to press the leader up the backstretch and into the turn, advanced on that one
and dueled into the stretch, long drive, proved unrelenting in the late going to persevere in game fashion. FULL AUTHORITY also was pushed out in the
early going, prompted the issue in the four path, challenged on the outside entering the stretch, late duel, outkicked. ENGAGE last to leave, was another
who was pushed out early, raced off the pace outside, came four wide for the drive, along for the show while slowly getting to the top two in the late going.
WELDER came out early to carry outer rivals out, was straightened to set the pace closest to but not on the inside, held a narrow advantage turn, briefly
dueled with the winner then could not keep up. HOT SHOT KID pushed out at the start, trailed, moved a bit closer when five wide turning for home, lacked a
further response. CHAMPAGNEONME off the pace along the inside, had little for the drive.

Footnotes
LETRUSKA broke a bit back, quickly recovered to take control into the first turn just off the inside, relaxed in showing the way up the backstretch remaining
in the two path, hooked up with the runner up for an extended stretch duel, headed approaching the furlong marker, came under a right handed crop soon
after, switched to a brisk left handed immediately after that, found more in the late going to narrowly prevail in an epic battle of wills. MONOMOY GIRL away
in good order, prompted the issue in the three path, continued to apply pressure into the far turn, challenged under confidant handling into the lane, put a
head in front nearing the furlong grounds, continued to hold advantage until late, outwilled in the late going while valiant in defeat, clearly best of the others.
SWISS SKYDIVER broke alertly, allowed the winner to go early inside, tracked that one up the backstretch while remaining along the rail and under firm
restraint, crept a bit closer early in the final turn, asked along late in that bend, had little for the top two when the real running began the final furlong.
GETRIDOFWHATAILESU away in good order, fell back along the inside to race in the second group, continued to save some ground through the second
bend, continued one paced through the lane while slowly gaining for the show. ANOTHER BROAD last away, remained back while moving off the inside,
three wide again 2nd turn, did not menace. CHANCE TO SHINE in the second flight off the inside, was never a factor.

under firm handling at the end. RAGATAGTAG in the second flight while well off the inside, came four wide into the lane, set down, slowly getting to the
winner late. FRILLS broke sharp, dueled up front while closest to the inside, continued to alternate for the lead past the furlong marker, weakened in the late
going , caught late for the place. SHAHARAZAD off a step slow, raced back and inside, advanced in the turn inside, steered out into the lane, finished
willingly while too late while well out in the strip. PICK UP THE FONE went one paced throughout while racing in the two path, lacked closing response.
FLEETA BELLE saved ground in the second flight, moved off the inside a bit for the drive, lacked a serious closing response. J P'S GLADYS back off the
pace, four wide into the turn, two wide exiting, no kick. FLATOYA broke well, cleared toward the inside early in setting the early pace, weakened before a
half. FLYING BUSINESS remained back while racing outside.
