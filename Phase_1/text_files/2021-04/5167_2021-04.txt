the drive and made a late bid, but was nipped on the wire by the top two. NORTH CROSS settled midpack early, advanced position along the turn, came
widest off of the turn, made a steady run in the stretch but just missed in a blanket finish. YOU SHOULD TALK sat just off of the early pace while saving
ground, continued to save ground on the turn, found running room in the three path in the stretch and made a late bid but just missed. POWERFUL

Footnotes
STORMIN GALILEO had the best speed and rated on the front end to the second turn, edged clear to mid stretch then dug in determinedly to hold. SPACE
ODESSEY was outsprinted for a half mile, got fanned four wide while rallying on the second turn then finished willingly but too late. J C EXPRESS pressed
the winner for six furlongs while in the two path, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task to the line. SOULONG was outrun for a half, raced three then
four wide to the stretch and had a mild late gain. ROARING TIGER broke out and pushed RIVER KAI into MAGIC IS FLYING, was also outsprinted to the
second turn then saved ground to no avail. COMMAND SGT MAJOR had no speed, settled to the second turn, raced four wide to the stretch and was not a
threat in the drive. DI LAURIAN settled mid pack for a half mile, saved ground on the second turn but came up empty in the drive. RIVER KAI was pushed
into MAGIC IS FLYING by ROARING TIGER at the start, lagged and was never a factor. MAGIC IS FLYING was crowded and checked at the start then had
no speed and was outrun.

Footnotes
CROI MOR was never far away to the second turn, rallied three then four wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch and drew clear driving.
ASSET attended the pace outside a rival, continued to duel two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task to get the place. POGO had
no speed, settled for a half mile, bid three wide into the second turn, swung five wide into the stretch then was not a threat to the winner and just missed the
place. SAL MAGLIE took the overland route to the backstretch, stalked to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, got outkicked by the winner and
tired late. BALIUS was stalking for a half mile, raced three then four wide on the far turn and did not rally in the drive. BELHAM hustled to contest the pace
two wide, dueled inside on the second turn but tired after six furlongs. QUAZE VIPER was allowed to settle to the half mile pole, saved ground to the stretch
but also did not rally. WHISPERING FLAME was unhurried to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response.
FROMAJACKTOAKING checked and was rank off heels into the first turn, had no speed and saved ground to no avail. TWOBITSOFIRISH had no speed,
trailed to the stretch then was eased when hopelessly beaten but walked off.

MORE BUBBLY broke alertly, set fractions while saving ground through the turn, was roused at the head of the stretch and kicked clear as much the best.
NO PARKING HERE chased the early pace from a two wide running position on the turn, was asked for run into the stretch and was outkicked by MORE
BUBBLY while still holding for second. REVEREND AL settled midpack early, was three wide on the turn, pushed up into contention at the top of the stretch
but could not mount a late rally in the stretch. PERFECT WAGER was unhurried early, moved up along the turn while two wide, but could not continue that
bid and ran evenly in the stretch. CAJUN BETTOR settled toward the back of the field early, was three wide on the turn and had no late rally. UNBRIDLED'S
SKYE chased leaders early, was outrun while three wide on the turn, and had no late response. DADDY JONES showed no early speed, was fanned four
wide on the turn, and had no late bid in the drive.

COOLCROSS pressed the pace for six furlongs, rallied two wide to the stretch, pushed to the front leaving mid stretch and held on stubbornly. K P D DAY
was outrun for a half mile, circled five wide on the second turn then responded once in the stretch, made a late surge and just missed. FINAL FINAL had no
speed, settled to the second turn, was inside then shifted two wide into the stretch, eased out for the stretch run, rallied but was outkicked late. BIG CITY
BANE also had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch then finished willingly late. BOYSON was five then four wide to the backstretch, stalked to the
second turn while easing in, saved ground to the stretch, stayed on to deep stretch then was outfinished. HE BE MOJO RISIN was chasing the pace to the
second turn, came two then three wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. MOSQUITO FLEET hustled to set the pace from the rail to the
stretch then was collared leaving mid stretch and tired. SECOND BOLD was allowed to settle to the second turn then saved ground to no avail. HULA KING
was four wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, got outrun to the stretch and did not rally. EXETER drifted six wide to the backstretch, tracked to
the second turn then was five wide to the stretch and gave out in the final furlong.
