Footnotes
POLITICAL RIOT raced well back in the two path, advanced between rivals around the far turn, angled four wide in upper stretch, kicked in outside and
drew clear. PALEMMA broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the early pace two wide, moved three wide to the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, led past the
eighth pole, was no match for the winner but fought on to hold off a rival for the place. ADMIRAL TRUFFLES tracked the duel two and three wide and was
one-paced in the lane. MAYOR REMO saved ground in midpack early, went four wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. ASCENDED dueled inside for a
half and weakened. SKYWALKING failed to menace while racing three wide. FORTY FLASH dueled two wide and faltered around the far turn. THIS RACE
WAS HAND TIMED WITH FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

ROUGH ENTRY set the pace slightly off the rail, shook off COMISKEY PARK turning for home, and shied out and in from the crop past the eighth-pole
while well clear. KHOZY MY BOY raced three to four wide around the turn, and rallied mildly. THE ICE BEAST broke a step slowly and was outrun early
inside, swung to the far outside approaching the stretch and was along for the show. COMISKEY PARK pressed ROUGH ENTRY from outside for a
half-mile, and weakened in the stretch. VALID EXCHANGE was no menace inside. BARAHIN was two wide and failed to factor.

SWIRLING CANDY set a clear pace inside and held clear under a drive. I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT chased the pace between foes down the backstretch,
brushed with FIGHTRESS entering the turn, saved ground off the pace around the bend, angled three wide turning for home, continued on the left lead to
the deep stretch and rallied for the place. TAYLOR'S IN ORBIT was off slow, steadied along inside around the turn, swung five wide in upper stretch and
rallied outside. AFFICIONADO (FR) raced off the pace two wide, fanned six wide into the lane and had a mild gain widest. FIGHTRESS stalked the pace
outside, brushed entering the turn, spent most of the bend tracking the winner two wide in the clear but faded in the lane. KATIELEIGH chased the pace
three wide and lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
LUMBERJACK went up inside UNCLE JAMO with an early move midway up the backstretch, edged away a bit through upper stretch, battled gamely
through a long drive and prevailed by the bob of a head. UNCLE JAMO bumped with DIMENNA at the start, set the early pace in the two-path, got joined
from the inside by LUMBERJACK just before completing a half-mile, stayed on stubbornly and just missed. LIGHT CRUISER saved ground outrun early,
took closer order through the middle stages while shifting to the two-path after six furlongs, went back to the rail for the drive and closed a late gap. STEAK
AND CHEESE saved ground on the turns, moved out in upper stretch and needed more. NACOZARI lagged well off the pace for six furlongs, skimmed the
rail at the top of the stretch, and improved without threatening. DIMENNA bumped with UNCLE JAMO at the start, prompted the pace outside, and faded
into the stretch. BLACK BELT was outrun three to four wide throughout. ZALINSKY broke poorly spotting the field two to three lengths, and showed little.
MAYBE AFTER LATER stopped after six furlongs, and jogged in far behind.

LITTLE DEMON settled off the duel inside, advanced three wide around the turn, steadily gained outside through the lane and wore down his foe in late
stretch. SOSOSUBTLE dueled two wide, drew clear midway around the turn, led past the sixteenth pole and yielded late. OFFICIATING raced off the pace
two wide, lacked a rally but stayed on to best the rest. MY MAXAMILLION lagged far back early and finished with belated interest. AMPERSAND broke
outwardly, was forwardly placed four wide and faded nearing the lane. AWESOME PUDDING dueled inside for a half and retreated.

MAMBA ON THREE bumped with SPEND BENJAMINS at the start, moved off the inside going past the three-eighths pole, entered the stretch in the
four-path, rallied determinedly outside and caught NITRO TIME in the closing strides. NITRO TIME sprinted to the front and moved inside after the start,
was clear to deep stretch but could not withstand the top one. HALCYON DIGEST steadied slightly behind MAMBA ON THREE early on the turn, and rallied
mildly on the rail. BREAKTHROUGH pursued the pacesetter from outside to upper stretch, and weakened. THINKABOUTIT raced three to four wide around
the turn, and could not gain through the lane. SPEND BENJAMINS hit the left side of the gate and bumped with MAMBA ON THREE at the start, and was
never close. MR TINGLES banged into the right side of the gate and was slowest away, and never recovered. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY
THE RIDER OF THINKABOUTIT FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN WAS DISMISSED. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

AWESOME ANNMARIE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace in the clear in the four path, swept to the front leaving the eighth pole and drew off
under a drive. LUANN settled off the pace along the rail, angled out in upper stretch, rallied between foes and gained the place in the final strides.
PATRICK'S LASS stalked the pace in the three path, bid between foes nearing the eighth pole, was no match for the winner from there and lost second late.
TIZ ENOUGH raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths pole and improved position. COMP'D was off a step slow, was hustled
inside to make the lead not long after, set the pace in the two path to midstretch and tired. JADE EMPRESS stumbled at the start and trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN RON pressed THE VIRGINIAN from outside, took over turning for home, edged away being merely flashed the crop past the eighth-pole, and was
geared down late to score by a measured margin. KANTHAROS' IMAGE saved ground for three furlongs, shifted out at the top of the stretch with aim
outside the leaders, gained to the finish but did not have quite enough. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR broke out bumping STAR WEAVER into KOBE FIFTY
TWO, saved ground in the second flight early, cut the corner into the lane, moved out rallying near the sixteenth-pole and finished well. THE VIRGINIAN set
a pressured pace inside, could not handle CAPTAIN RON through upper stretch, and weakened through the closing stages. KOBE FIFTY TWO got bumped
by STAR WEAVER at the start, raced three wide around the turn, and lacked a final bid. STAR WEAVER got bumped into KOBE FIFTY TWO by
SOVEREIGN WARRIOR and steadied at the break, and was no threat two to three wide. COMPLEX SYSTEM broke two lengths slow, saved ground outrun
early, and steadied behind SOVEREIGN WARRIOR in deep stretch. AN OBJECTION AGAINST SOVEREIGN WARRIOR BY THE RIDER OF COMPLEX
SYSTEM FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
BRODY'S HONOR set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. MARICOPA settled off the pace along the inside, swung four wide near the
quarter pole and ran on to gain the place. SIGNING BONUS saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the quarter pole and finished evenly. JAZZY
T stalked the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. GOTHAM QUEEN pressed the winner two wide and tired in the drive. WATERMELON SUGAR was
bumped just after the start, raced two wide and never threatened. MON PARADIS was in tight at the start and made little impact while racing two and three
wide. ST. LOUIE ARCH had brief speed two wide. DERALDINE chased the pace four wide and was through after a half. KAYLA'S TUNE was outrun while
racing three and four wide. GRACEFULLY bumped WATERMELON SUGAR soon after the start, saved ground well back, went four wide around the far turn
and was never close. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
