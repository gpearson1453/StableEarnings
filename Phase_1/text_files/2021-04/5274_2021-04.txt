Footnotes
TEMPTING VIOLET speedy, but erratic. RUNAWA RENEE bumped early, up for place, shied from lights at wire. LINDT gave chase outside, denied second.
WATAH WAGON floated out, bumped, squeezed at start. FIRST N TRU bumped sideways at start. APOLLITICAL FREEDOM shrugged off bump, no bid.
THREE SIX OCEAN DR broke out, scrambled rivals. REBAS LIL EAGLE bumped hard between, shuffled back. VEGAS PIC hopped, off poorly, bumped
rival. HARD LICK bumped early, dropped out. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED
THREE SIX OCEAN DR FROM SEVENTH AND PLACED HIM EIGHTH FOR BREAKING OUT, CREATING A CHAIN REACTION OF BUMPING
IMPACTING THE RUNNERS TO HIS OUTSIDE, PARTICULARLY REBAS LIL EAGLE.
