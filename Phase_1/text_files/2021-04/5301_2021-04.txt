Footnotes
SKYE SNOW raced in range two wide, bid between foes near the three-eighths pole, led between rounding the far turn and drew off under a drive in upper
stretch. GYPSY WIFE was a bit sluggish early, raced off the pace two wide, made strong progress four deep down the backstretch, bid three wide outside of
the winner early on the far turn, vied outside around the bend, was no match in upper stretch but stayed on to save the place. JIMMYSSMOKEDCARROT
stalked the pace inside early and two wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. STAR SWEPT bobbled at the break, saved ground in midpack,
ran up on heels and checked nearing the far turn, made some progress three wide around the turn and flattened out in the lane. LOVELY BROWN saved
ground off the early pace, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. PLAY THAT TONE had speed three wide and was through after a half.
KAYSERI set the pace along the rail, was collared near the five-sixteenths pole, checked near the quarter pole and had no further bids. RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
REAGAN'S HEART lagged well back for three furlongs, fanned widest into the stretch, rallied steadily and caught GRAN MALBEC with 70 yards remaining.
GRAN MALBEC raced two to three wide around the turn, reached the front outside APACHE BRAVE and VISION PERFECT coming to the eighth-pole,
then could not withstand the winner. MARCELINO saved ground in the second flight to the lane, and offered a mild response in the two-path. TALE OF
KANTHAROS raced two to three wide around the turn, and improved position without threatening. VISION PERFECT chased outside the pacesetter for
three furlongs, bid through upper stretch, but was outfinished. APACHE BRAVE sprinted clear early, and gave way through the stretch inside. COLONEL
TOM was outrun inside. TENACITY ZIP pursued the leaders three to four wide, and had nothing left into the lane.

Footnotes
KERIK broke outwardly, tracked the pace four wide, steadily gained through the lane, took over leaving the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a drive.
OUR WEST INDY pressed the pace in the three path, bid between foes in midstretch but was outkicked by the winner. HOT BABE bumped with BENEFIT
ST at the start, rushed up to set the pace in the two path, led to the sixteenth pole and weakened. BENEFIT ST was bumped at the start, saved ground in
range, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. FACTS ONLY broke awkwardly then was shut off at the start, lagged well back inside, raced
two wide around most of the turn, angled five wide nearing the quarter pole and lacked a closing bid. ADDI was outrun inside. TAMMANY hopped at the
start, raced five wide and made little impact. FROSTED MISTRESS played no factor while racing three wide. GOTHAM QUEEN had speed four wide and
was through after a half.

Footnotes
ABIDING STAR broke to the lead, carved out a fast pace inside, came into the stretch in the two-path and remained clear under a steady drive. BELGRANO
bumped with ZAP DADDY at the start, saved ground edging a bit closer after a half-mile, came out for room bumping MID DAY IMAGE at the top of the
stretch, rallied into second through the furlong grounds but could not reach the winner. LAHINCH saved ground outrun to the stretch, shifted to the two-path
and finished with interest. MID DAY IMAGE raced four then three wide on the turns, got bumped by BELGRANO at the head of the lane, and lacked the
needed closing response. CUESTION DE TIEMPO chased ABIDING STAR through fast fractions, and weakened in the stretch. ZAP DADDY bumped with
BELGRANO at the start, and was always outrun. VOW ME NOW got off to a stutter-step start, raced three to four wide on the turns and made no headway
in the stretch on the far outside. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

DROPPED ANCHOR set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. GEGE CONQUEST chased the winner from the rail, tipped out in upper
stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and was clearly second best. HARD GAME bumped with KHOZANDO at the start, stalked the pace two wide
between foes and lacked a closing bid. CARAMEL CHIP saved ground and failed to menace. KHOZANDO bumped with HARD GAME at the start, raced
two wide and never threatened. BRACCIO DI FERRO played no factor while racing three wide. LEASE chased the pace three wide and retreated through
the lane.

Footnotes
YES I AM FREE sped to the front with an alert getaway, shook off INTER MIAMI after three furlongs, kicked away through upper stretch and dug in late to
hold on. OLD CHESTNUT chased three wide from the outset, stayed on with good courage and was getting to the winner from outside at the finish. MAI TY
ONE ON saved ground throughout, and finished evenly. INTER MIAMI pressed the winner from outside for three furlongs, and weakened through
midstretch. CITRUS BURST was never a factor. NO NEEDS NEVER (IRE) dwelt at the start spotting the field about six lengths, and trailed. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.
