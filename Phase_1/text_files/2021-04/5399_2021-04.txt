ATOMIC CANDY set a pressured pace from the inside, shook clear on the second turn, remained clear leaving the furlong marker then held on late to prove
best under a strong drive. YOUVESAIDITALL was settled back early, advanced while four wide on the far turn, closed well on the outside but was too late.
ASTOUNDING was allowed to settle early while saving ground, angled off the rail leaving the far turn, but lacked the needed winning bid when roused.
HAWKWOOD was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the stretch to offer a belated rally. KNOWYOUROPTIONS was five wide into the first turn,
made a four wide middle move on the backstretch to press the pace four wide but weakened. NOBLE EGYPTIAN pressed the pace three wide then stopped
after six furlongs. ERASMO'S DREAM was through after a half.

DARPA was three wide into the first turn, then went on to set the pace and move over to the inside, was well handled on the front end, drew clear on the far
turn, then was kept to her task to prove best. STAR GAZE was rated on the inside, advanced on the inside on the second turn, angled out in the stretch to
rally well but could not get to the winner, clearly second best. UNDIVIDED chased the early pace, came into the stretch towards the inside but offered no
rally while gaining the show award. EUTYCHIA was allowed to settle early on the inside, then eased off the rail around the three eighths pole, came into the
stretch four wide but offered no rally. SHEZA HOT FLASH broke outwardly at the start, then was four wide into the first turn, went up to stalk the pace three
wide then tired.

Footnotes
STONE FOX was off slow, rushed to contend, stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to gain command nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
opened a clear margin in mid-stretch and held sway to the wire. TEXAS WHIRLWIND was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing
three-wide, opened a clear margin after the opening quarter, but could not match strides with the winner in the drive. KITTY'S QUEEN was reserved just off
the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner late but finished with good energy. LILLIEGETYOURGUN lagged early,
saved ground through the turn and found her best stride late. SILENT BELL settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to gain late.
KYLIE'S TWO SOX raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide tough the turn and lacked the needed rally. CLASSY BLING raced just off the leaders
from between foes, steadied and dropped back nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and did not menace thereafter. A SONG FOR MICKEY broke sharply to
chase the pace of TEXAS WHIRLWIND while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. DAVID'S DREAM GIRL lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
GURKHA GOLD (IRE) set a pressured pace from off the rail, responded when challenged by JUBELLA nearing the quarter, vied with that rival, was bumped
by that foe into the lane and carried that rival out through the final sixteenth. JUBELLA raced four-wide through the first turn, moved up three-wide to offer a
bid nearing the quarter, vied with the winner, drifted inward to bump that foe nearing the three-sixteenths pole, was carried out by that rival through the final
sixteenth and lost best chance. FASHION RAGE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position and
finished evenly late. SAPPHIRE raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. FOX APPEAL pressed the
pace of the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. CALESCENT raced off the leaders early, moved between foes into the second
turn, raced four-wide through that turn and failed to rally. PAYDIEM lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
FASHION MOON showed no early speed, raced seven-wide through the second turn and did not reach contention. SILVER DEVIL raced off the leaders
early, moved three-wide through the second turn and gradually weakened. SORORITY ROW was void of early speed, saved ground through the second
turn and did not menace. WAR FALCON showed brief speed from the inside and weakened. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING
THE BUMPING INCIDENT AT THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE AND THE DRIFTING OUT OF GURKHA GOLD (IRE) THROUGH THE FINAL
SIXTEENTH AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS DISQUALIFIED GURKHA GOLD (IRE) FROM FIRST AND PLACED HER SECOND FOR CARRYING
OUT JUBELLA THROUGH THE FINAL SIXTEENTH.

Footnotes
ABOUT OUR TIME was away alertly, went up to vie for the lead on the inside while in hand, then made a inside bid on the turn, drew clear entering the
stretch, then was kept to left handed urging to prove best. MY BOANERGES was well rated while three wide early, then came four wide into the drive to
rally well. TIZ ALLUPTOME NOW was allowed to settle early, came into the stretch four wide but offered no significant rally while getting up for the show
award. SHANNON C vied for the lead three wide, then set a pressured pace on the turn, weakened final furlong. DREAMS OF VALOR was climbing early,
then got into stride past the quarter pole while being no threat. BETA LAKE chased the early pace then weakened.

ALGEBRA was well rated early while saving ground, continued to save ground entering the stretch, rallied well up the rail to get up determinedly under a
drive. SHIFTY HENRY dueled for the lead on the inside, made a bid to shake clear past the three sixteenths pole, then angled off the rail past the eight pole,
dug in gamely but was outfinished by the winner late. GOOD JUDGMENT chased the early pace six wide, made a four wide bid entering the stretch to loom
boldly, but hung late. SHOTSOFT chased the early pace and came into the stretch five wide to offer a mild late rally. MEN OF KYLE was allowed to settle
early while four wide, came into the stretch five wide and offered a belated rally. KATS SECOND SILVER pressed the early pace four wide then weakened.
MORO SAID READY dueled for the lead three wide then was empty in the stretch. EYES ON RED was hustled along early before weakening. DAUNTLESS
PRINCE failed to menace. BEST LITTLE MAN raced from between rivals early then faded. MACHO FLYER was not a factor. TEXAS WARRIOR pressed
the early pace three wide and from between rivals then weakened.
