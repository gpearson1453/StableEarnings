Footnotes
ONE GLAMOROUS GAL was bumped at the start, set all the pace, finished full of run and won going away. RAINBOW SHIP chased the winner and
finished well clear for second while no match. RONNI'S DAY ducked in causing her rider to lose his irons at the start, he quickly got back in then passed
tiring rivals through the stretch on the outside. GLORIOUS GLITTER failed to menace. GETOUTOFTHEHAREM was no factor. I GOT HOPE had speed
through the turn then weakened. HAUGHTY PRAISE trailed.
