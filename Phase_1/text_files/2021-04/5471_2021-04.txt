ELITCH was allowed to settle early while saving ground, advanced on the far turn while on the rail, slipped through leaving the furlong marker, then was up
late to prove best under right handed encouragement. CAYMANS COBRA was sent to the front to set the pace while racing off the rail, was well handled
throughout, was sent down leaving the quarter pole, but could not hold off the winner late, good effort. MILLWOOD was rated early while three wide, made a
four wide bid and in between rivals on the far turn, but hung late, held show award. G'S TURN stalked the early pace three wide, then found himself in
between rivals from the quarter pole to leaving the eighth pole, but had no punch, hung. RUN TAPPY was reserved early, came seven wide into the stretch
to offer a belated rally under hand urging. MATHESON was well placed early and two wide then wads empty. EARNEDNEVERGIVEN was allowed to settle
early while five wide on the backstretch, made a five wide bid past the quarter pole but tired in the drive.

Footnotes
OCTOBER SURPRISE was reserved early, was six wide on the backstretch while in hand, made a five wide on the far turn, hit the front around the furlong
marker then drew clear to prove best under a drive. SHARP ROCKET was allowed to settle early while covered up, came into the stretch three wide, angled
in for racing room by the eighth pole, but could not go with the winner while being second best. GODDARD was off a step slow, then was reserved early,
then raced in between rivals while four wide past the three eighths pole, had to steady by the five sixteenths pole, then came into the stretch seven wide to
finish well late. STASIS was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the far turn to gain a short advantage leaving the quarter pole, but was empty
in the final furlong, bested rest. GO SPEED RACER GO pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the backstretch to vie for command then
gave way after six furlongs. DYNA STRIKE set a pressured pace on the inside then gave way. J J HUNDRED PROOF was well placed early on the inside
then tired. TRUE GLORY stalked the early pace and was between horses while three wide on the backstretch then stopped.
