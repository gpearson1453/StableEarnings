Footnotes
SITTIN AND THINKIN chased the early pace, was three wide along the turn while dueling for position, gained position into the stretch, made a late bid and
just got up to win the head nod on the wire. TAKES A VILLAGE chased the early pace from toward the rear of the field, was two wide on the turn while
dueling for position, pressured LUV IS ALL U NEED into the stretch, was confronted by SITTIN AND THINKIN late and could not hold off that rival, but held
for second. LUV IS ALL U NEED set a contested pace through the backstretch and turn, was two wide along the turn, was confronted inside the eighth pole
and could not hold off those foes but held for third. REGAL LADY pressed the early pace, saved ground along the turn, lost position into the stretch and tired
in the drive. FELONY ONE had no speed early,checked into the turn, was two wide along the turn and had no response in the stretch drive.

the stretch to pounce on the leader and was clear in the end. TOTALLY NORMAL had no speed early, saved ground along the second turn while still toward
the back, improved position into the stretch and made a late rally for second, though was not challenging the winner. BORN TO REIGN settled toward the
rear of the field early, was three wide along the second turn, and finished willingly in the stretch, just missing for second. OURSENSATIONALGIRL set the
early fractions for three-quarters, saved ground along the second turn while being pressured by the winner and weakened in the stretch drive. DARLING

NINA EN FUEGO went right to the front, rated on the lead for six furlongs while saving ground then responded determinedly in the stretch to hold. DOC
YCO CHEEKS settled mid pack to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch then finished willingly for the place. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN stalked the
winner to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. PERFECT STORIES trailed to the half, saved ground
to the stretch and was gaining without seriously threatening. ROSE PRINCESS tracked the winner from the rail to the stretch then also did not threaten in
the drive. ROLINGA had no speed, settled to the second turn but had little to offer in the stretch run.
