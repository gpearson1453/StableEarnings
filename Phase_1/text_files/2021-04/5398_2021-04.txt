Footnotes
SILVER CLOUD chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path approaching the three eighths pole, dueled on the
outside in upper stretch and drew clear in the final furlong. COLOROFACLOUD settled in the middle of the pack through the opening half mile, raced in the
two path around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground on the outside late. SHE'S WANDAFUL stumbled and swerved in sharply
leaving the gate, nearly hit the rail, corrected to trail the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began to improve position while drifting in
the stretch, and continued to gain ground to the wire. LUSCIOUS was urged to the lead out of the gate, showed the way from the two path up the
backstretch and around the turn, dueled in upper stretch and gave way between horses in the final furlong. WINNINGISFUN chased the leader on the inside
up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, made a mild bid in upper stretch and flattened out from there. JOAN'S WAY broke slowly, trailed the field
on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two and three path and made no bid.

Footnotes
VENETIAN DREAM was placed on the lead inside, saved ground while clear on the lead through the turn, extended his advantage when driven through
midstretch, and was kept to task until the final strides. BIG CYPRESS chased just behind the tracking flight early, improved to track the pacesetter in the
three path on the turn, proved no match for the winner when driven in the lane but kept on willingly to hold the place. RENEGADE BOB chased outside of
BIG CYPRESS early, was driven three deep in the four path on the turn, continued under a drive in upper stretch, lacked the needed kick to catch the top
two but stayed on well enough to hold for show. FLORIDA FLASH reared at the start and came slowly away, trailed down the backstretch, took closer order
in the four to five path past the three eighths, past outside tiring horses in upper stretch and ran evenly late. BERACUDA HEART tracked the leader inside
of TO THE BANK early, chased in the two path on the turn, came up empty inside in upper stretch and weakened. TO THE BANK was hard urged early but
outsprinted to the lead, tracked the pace outside of BERACUDA HEART early, faded in the three path between horses on the turn and had no more for the
drive.

Footnotes
CHINOBE dueled for the lead on outside in the opening stages, took over after a quarter of a mile, continued to extend his lead while saving ground around
the turn, and was ridden out to the wire, much the best. WHERE'D THE DAY GO raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn, launched a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. COCO BRAVADO dueled for the
lead on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, dropped back to stalk the leader while saving ground around the turn, swung wide entering the
stretch and finished evenly on the outside. SOVIET raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, launched a
mild bid approaching the quarter pole and was outkicked in the final furlong. MASTER GUNS trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the turn, made a mild gain of ground in upper stretch and flattened out from there. COPPER CROSSING was squeezed back leaving the gate and
raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. MOON FLASH hopped up slightly leaving the gate,
raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, moved up slightly from the three path around the turn, was carried wide into the stretch and made no bid.
THE WINNER SET A NEW COURSE RECORD FOR FIVE FURLONGS ON THE TURF.

LILY'S WOOFY broke well, was placed on the lead three paths off the rail, was a bit keen while clear in the two path on the turn, and steadily drew off under
mostly hand urging and occasional use of the crop. RONAN came out early and bumped WAR COLORS in the opening strides, soon trailed, took closer
order in the three path past the three eighths, swung out seven wide in upper stretch, rallied outside, never threatened the leader but proved a clear second
best. WAR COLORS was bumped between horses in the opening strides, settled in second last, chased in the three path on the turn while beginning to
improve position, swung out and was driven in the five path in upper stretch, chased between horses but was outfinished for the place. ONE FLASHY GIRL
was fractious in the gate, raced at the inside of the tracking flight, tracked the leader in the three path on the turn, was pushed along near the three eighths
to mount a bid on the leader, could not keep pace with her despite being put to a drive near the quarter, and flattened out in the two path in the lane. HEART
OF REASON broke out and bumped WAR COLORS in the opening strides, raced between horses in the tracking flight in the opening furlong, settled back
behind the tracking flight from the five eighths, tracked the leading pair in the four path on the turn, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, and faded in the
lane. LA ROSE tracked the leader outside down the backstretch, began to fade in the six to seven path from the seven sixteenths, was driven in upper
stretch and had no response.

Footnotes
U. S. CURRENCY broke quickly and opened up a sizeable lead while racing in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save
ground around the far turn, was headed at the top of the stretch, dueled on the inside the length of the stretch and held the win. SIMPLY FAST raced in the
three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, briefly
took the lead entering the stretch, dueled on the outside down the lane and just missed. SEVEN KINGDOMS raced in the two path around the first turn,
settled several lengths behind the frontrunner on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the two approaching the three eighths pole, was
outkicked in upper stretch, and drifted out in the final furlong while finishing evenly. RISKY RISKY RISKY trailed the field from the two path through the
opening half mile, continued around the far turn still in the two path and passed tiring horses on the outside in late stretch. JANE'S GOLD TOUR raced off
the pace in the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, made a mild gain coming off the far turn
and flattened out in the final furlong. IRISH HALO raced into traffic and was checked headed into the first turn, bolted out following that incident, was angled
back in to trail the field on the outside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and was not a threat. EMILY BUG saved ground
around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch on the inside, began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and continued to tire
from there. HOOK HER UP saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, dropped back while racing around
the far turn, was pulled up, walked off the turf course and then vanned off as a precaution. The seven furlong video fraction was impossible and removed
from the chart.

KIANA'S LOVE stalked the pace outside of ARCTIC MUSIC early, tracked that leader outside of LIL BE QUICK into the turn, raced in the four path in range
around the bend, swung six wide into upper stretch and went to a drive, led approaching the furlong pole, and drove clear while drifting slightly inward.
DEVIL'S ROSE settled at the rear, continued at the rear in the two path on the turn, rallied up the fence into the lane, angled outside of LIL BE QUICK near
the furlong marker, proved no match for KIANA'S LOVE but kept on willingly to get up for the place. LIL B QUICK chased midpack inside of HEY HEY early,
improved position into the turn to track the leader inside of KIANA'S LOVE, made a bid inside of ARCTIC MUSIC into the lane, led in upper stretch, was
headed approaching the furlong mark by KIANA'S LOVE, flattened out inside after being headed but held the show. HYPNOTISING settled toward the rear
between horses early, chased in the three path on the turn, was urged between horses in upper stretch, kept on while racing in tight quarters through
midstretch, kept on under a drive three wide late and missed the show. HEY HEY chased the leading pair outside of LIL B QUICK early, was pushed along
in the five path on the turn, swung out seven wide into the lane and went to a drive, rallied mildly but was outfinished through the final furlong. TINDERELLA
settled outside DEVIL'S ROSE and HYPNOTISING early, continued outside DEVIL'S ROSE in the three to four path in the rear flight on the turn, floated
seven wide into upper stretch, went to a drive, and offered no response. ARCTIC MUSIC set the pace down the backstretch and in the three path on the
turn, floated five wide into the stretch and went to a drive, was headed in upper stretch by LIL B QUICK to her inside, kept on between horses under a drive
until the furlong mark, and folded.

Footnotes
MINISTER'S GLORY was bumped by YOUNG CORBETT in the opening strides, settled toward the rear inside early, was pushed along to keep the first two
flights in his sights while racing in the two path on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied under a drive, hit the front at the furlong mark, drove
clear from there, and held safe. TIMINGISEVERYTHING was pinched back between SOUTHSIDER and COLOMBARD in the opening strides, settled well
back down the backstretch, continued in the rear flight in the three to four path on the turn, swung out six wide into the stretch, went to a drive in upper
stretch, was full of run from the furlong pole and gained to the wire. SOUTHSIDER broke outward and bumped TIMINGISEVERYTHING in the opening
strides, was sent well clear in the opening furlong, was engaged by YOUNG CORBETT near the nine sixteenths, vied outside that foe to the three
sixteenths, shook YOUNG CORBETT off at that point but was soon engaged by MINISTER'S GLORY to his outside, proved no match for that foe into the
final furlong, had no answer for the late run of TIMINGISEVERYTHING to the far outside but held for the show. YOUNG CORBETT came in and bumped
MINSTER'S GLORY in the opening strides, chased the leader inside of STUMP early, engaged inside of SOUTHSIDER near the nine sixteenths, vied
inside that foe to the three sixteenths, proved no match from there, but chased on with enough to save a minor award. STUMP raced between horses in the
chasing flight early, tracked the leading pair past the nine sixteenths and in the three path on the turn inside of COLOMBARD, proved no match for the
leading pair into the lane and flattened through the final furlong. CHARLIE IRISH settled in second last, raced in the two path on the turn, was driven inside
in upper stretch, took mildly closer order but ultimately proved no threat. COLOMBARD bumped with TIMINGISEVERYTHING in the opening strides, raced
three wide in the chasing flight early, tracked the leading pair outside of STUMP into the turn, raced in the four path around the bend, and had no rally in the
lane.
