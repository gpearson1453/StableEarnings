Footnotes
CROWN AND COKE rated a short lead inside, was prompted toward the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady
encouragement to hold on. BROTHER SKYE rounded the opening turn about the three path then settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid
toward the three eighths pole, closed the gap to the wire and finished well. LUNAR IMAGE stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase leaving the three
eighths pole but flattened near the rail on the far turn. PLEASANTLY ROYAL settled off the early pace in the three and four paths and raced outside into the
backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. RAGTIME COWBOY JOE refused to break. The
Stewards posted the inquiry before declaring this race official. In addition, this race was hand timed.

Footnotes
BANK ON CANDY stalked off the rail then bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled to the lead while between horses and made repeated contact with
Lucky Park midway on the far turn, dueled clear past the eighth pole and was steadily encouraged through the lane. STEPHANOPOULOS rounded the
opening turn about the four path then bid nearing the three eighths pole, challenged three wide past the five sixteenths pole, contested the far turn at even
terms but dropped back inside the eighth pole and settled for second. PRINCE VALESKI rated off the early pace inside then raced outside into the
backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and was along for third late. LUCKY PARK rated the early pace
inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, checked and gave up the nod at the rail while exchanging contact with Bank On Candy midway
on the far turn, then weakened. YES MEANS NO raced off the pace about the three path the first turn and was well back into the backstretch, then showed
little response. CECIL THE LION raced off the early pace about the three path and never factored. YOUCANTFIXSTUPID was through early. The Stewards
reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Bank On Candy, lodged by the rider of Lucky Park, though, took no action.

HYPOTHESIS set a pressured contested pace and maintained the edge nearest the rail on the turn, then dug in under determined handling to ward off the
game challenge of SAGEBRUSH, who came away sharply and pressured the winner, raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn and continued
gamely to the finish. AARON'S TAP gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn and finished evenly. UNRIDEABULL chased through the backstretch,
raced in the three path of the turn but was carried out and steadied into the lane and showed little more. FAIRWEATHER FRIEND chased inside, raced at
the rail on the turn, drifted into the lane then weakened. PER RULING #22 FROM THE WEST VIRGINIA RACING COMMISSION, HYPOTHESIS WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

SUSPIROS rated the pace inside, was prompted a bit at the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the far turn, then kept alert through the lane. AHMAS
stalked from the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but proved no match. GOLD CZAR became anxious in the gate then stumbled at the
break, raced well back from early contention, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and was along for third the
final strides. BLOKE stalked the early pace off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. NTH
POWER saved ground off the early pace and never factored.

SAINTE THERESE rated close inside the first turn, started a three wide bid approaching the three eighths pole and closed to the front two deep nearing the
quarter, drew clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled down the lane. MACKENZIE'S STAR saved ground off the early pace, bid from the
seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, then dug in to take second later yards. KATIE'S BAYOU rated the pace inside, was
prompted for run leaving the three eighths pole, gave up the lead at the rail nearing the quarter, dropped back midway on the far turn then flattened stride.
CATTY KRYS raced well off the pace and off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, continued off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly
down the lane. CAPTAIN ANNE rounded the first turn in the four path then settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
though, flattened about the four path of the far turn. JEAN GREY raced well off the pace and left the first turn outside, gave chase leaving the three eighths
pole and passed a rival widest in the lane. ENDUROS TIGRESS closed toward contention and stalked the early pace off the rail, gave chase into the
backstretch then faded past the three eighths pole.

GREY INVASION settled off the pace about the three path the opening turn, rallied to the front three wide approaching the five sixteenths pole, drew clear
while angling to the inside entering the far turn, then dug in under steady handling through the lane. POLITICAL DECISION was reluctant to load and came
away sharply, though awkwardly, stalked from the inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, lost momentum past the five sixteenths, ran in the three
path the far turn, dug in to take second mid-stretch and finished evenly. BURN THE SHIPS took the lead at the three quarter pole and rated the pace toward
the inside, was prompted approaching the three eighths, gave up the lead nearing the five sixteenths then dueled close in the upper stretch before
weakening. ANCHOR UP raced well back and could only improve his position. DESERT LION raced well off the pace and off the rail the first turn, started a
bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little more. BOSEY raced in the four path the opening turn and showed little
response through the backstretch. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Grey Invasion, lodged by the rider of Political Decision for an
alleged infraction past the five sixteenths pole, though found no cause for change.
