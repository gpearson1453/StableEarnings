pole and was pressured late but dug in for the win. ROCK SLINGER chased the early fractions while close up, was four wide on the turn while still close up,
came four wide into the stretch running on left lead, found more run late to pressure SMILE FOR ASHLEY but could not reel in the leader, while holding for
second. GOBSMACK settled in the early stages, improved position while five wide on the turn, continued with that bid in the stretch and rallied to get third.
GRAY GEM chased the early pace, was three wide along the turn as part of a five wide flight, vied for lead entering the stretch but was outkicked late. IRISH
TERRIER settled in the middle of the pack early, saved ground along the turn while running in the second flight, made a mild bid inside the eighth pole but
could not sustain that run and finished evenly in the stretch. DADDY JONES broke inwards at the start,had no speed early, continued to trail through
backstretch and run on turn while three wide, and had no late rally. HARDY CHISEL assumed pace through backstretch and turn runs, saved ground on
turn, kept the lead inside of the eighth pole but tired in the late stages. RED STAR settled in the middle of the pack, lost position on the turn while two wide,

Footnotes
AROUSE N GO settled just off of the early pace, continued to sit in the pocket along the turn while two wide, swung four wide for the stretch drive, made a
bold late rally and just got up in the final yards to get the win. PAPAYA chased the early pace in the backstretch run, continued to chase along the turn while
three wide, vied for the lead off of the turn, led inside of the eighth pole, could not hold off the oncoming challenge of AROUSE N GO but held for second.
ABRAA JABRAA was hustled to the early lead, set fractions while saving ground through the backstretch and turn, was confronted by PAPAYA entering the
stretch, gave up the lead to that rival and tired late while holding for third. INCREDIBLY LUCKY was unhurried early, improved position along the turn while
three wide but could not go on with that bid and finished evenly in the stretch. CIRCULODEGANADORAS chased the early pacesetter from a two wide
running position, continued to press the pace through the turn two wide between horses, was asked for run entering the drive but had no late rally. PURE
PERFECTION settled toward the rear of the field, was rank into the turn while being outrun and was not a threat in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MOON ASCENDING stalked the early pace, slipped onto the rail for the run into the turn, pressed the pace on the turn while saving ground, took the lead
inside of the eighth pole and was clear late for the win. SILLY IMAGE was allowed to settle early, saved ground along the turn while two wide and still
toward the rear of the field, pushed up four wide at the top of the stretch to find racing room and made a late rally in the drive for second. PROUD LION was
away well, then chased the early pacesetter, was three wide between horses on the turn, chased the leaders into the stretch and just missed for second.
EMPEROR'S FISC settled in the middle of the pack early, was two wide along the turn while still racing midflight, and finished evenly in the stretch drive.
FURLONGIN FOR LUV chased the early pace, kept a ground saving trip through the turn while two wide behind the leaders, was outrun into the stretch and
tired late. TRIBUNAL LOVE was away well, took control of the fractions through the backstretch and turn, was between horses on the turn, was confronted
approaching the top of the stretch and could not go on with his bid and weakened late. BLUE SUNSET was unhurried early, saved ground through the turn
and had no response late. JETTSVILLE had no early speed, saved ground into the turn, and was always outrun.

Footnotes
BIGFOOT CITY took command of early fractions while saving ground through the backstretch and second turn, continued to lead into the stretch, was
pressured late by DIRT ROAD RED but gamely dug in to prevail. DIRT ROAD RED settled in the middle of the pack through the early stages, saved ground
along the backstretch, improved position while saving ground on the second turn, angled out in the stretch to pressure BIGFOOT CITY and could not get by
that rival while still second best. STONE GROOVE hopped at the start, was five wide along the first turn while close up, continued to stalk the pace through
the second turn while two wide, lost position into the stretch and finished evenly for third. LINFIELD was unhurried early, settling at the rear of the field,
improved position on the second turn while three wide, and made a mild late bid in the stretch. AGENT ZERO had no early speed, was three wide on the
second turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. SECOND BOLD chased the early pace, saved ground through the backstretch and run on the second
turn, was outrun on the turn and was not a threat late. JUST LIKE FRED chased the early pace, was five wide on backstretch, lost position along the
backstretch, was three wide along the turn, and faded in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ALVAARO assumed command of the early pace, saved ground through the backstretch and on the second turn, was in hand entering the stretch, was
mildly asked for run in the stretch and was clear late. K P D DAY was unhurried early, advanced position along the backstretch, continued to gain while
saving ground on the second turn, looked for racing room entering the stretch, angled out for the drive and made a late rally but was not challenging the
winner while an easy second. COUNTING CARDS settled in the middle of the pack, was between horses while three wide on the second turn, was asked
for run into the stretch but was outkicked by the top two. ROUEN was allowed to settle early, lost position while four wide along the backstretch and second
turn, found running room late but could not mount a late bid in the stretch. GALLOPING MISCHIEF stalked the early pace, was two wide on the backstretch
and second turn run, continued to be close heading into the stretch but could not go on with that run and weakened late. DUB TOWN was allowed to settle
early, saved ground through the backstretch and run on the second turn, checked nearing the top of the stretch, and did not have a late rally in the stretch.
BRAZILIAN SUMMER chased the early pace, continued to chase through the backstretch run, was three wide on the second turn while losing position, and
faded in the stretch run.

NIGHT GIG settled in the middle of the pack early, sat in the pocket on the turn while saving ground, improved position off of the turn, slipped to the rail for
the drive and kicked clear in the end. SHOULD BE ILLEGAL chased the early pace, edged up along the turn while four wide and close to the pace, took the
lead entering the stretch, was collared by NIGHT GIG late and could not hold that rival off while holding for second. OUR EXPECTATION was unhurried
early, was two wide along the turn while improving position, continued that bid along the rail in the stretch and rallied for third. R M C HOOK'EM chased the
early pace, was four wide along the turn, while still close to the pace, and finished evenly in the stretch. AWESOME DUDE had no early speed, trailed
through the turn while four wide, and had no late rally in the stretch. NO PARKING HERE chased the early pace, was three wide on the turn while still close
up, lost position entering the stretch and tired late. PALALEO set a contested pace from a two wide running position, held the lead through the turn, was
headed by SHOULD BE ILLEGAL entering the stretch and gave way late. HAWK HILL pressured the early pace from a rail trip, kept that pace pressure on
through the turn while saving ground and was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
UNION DANCE never far back to the second turn, shifted off the rail and was two wide into the stretch then responded to split rivals in mid stretch, pushed
to the front and held stubbornly. SHADRACK was outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the half, circled four wide while rallying on the second turn,
pushed to the front in mid stretch then could not stall the winner. CLAIM OF PASSION attended the pace between rivals and two wide to the second turn,
dueled for the lead to mid stretch then got outkicked by the top two. SEEKING REFUGE was settled for a half mile, raced two then three wide on the second
turn but could not threaten in the drive. MORE POWER TO HIM also was allowed to settle to the half, saved ground on the second turn but came up empty
in the stretch run. READY SAY GO bobbled shortly after the stretch then trailed to the stretch and did not rally. RESPECT THE HUSTLE was a pace factor
to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then tired. DESCARTES hustled to the front, dueled from the rail for six furlongs then gave out.
