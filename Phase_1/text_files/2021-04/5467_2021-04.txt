LASTING INFLUENCE tracked the pace set by INTHEMISTYMOONLITE three and four wide, rallied through the lane to wear that one down and be along
in time. INTHEMISTYMOONLITE moved off to a clear lead inside, made the running to upper stretch and was worn down through the final sixteenth.
ULTRA CORDIAL was five wide into the first turn, remained outside and had no closing run in the drive. DIAMONDS N SPURS saved ground and could not
threaten late. DIXIE CHIP trailed the field racing three wide.

LIL MISS DE BUY forced the pace outside TRUE ALLEGIANCE, bid through the far turn to edge clear and held safe in the lane. ANWARA saved ground
behind the early pace, angled three or four wide into the lane to get nearest the winner then had her rider lose whip inside the sixteenth marker and could
not get to the winner. TRUE ALLEGIANCE made the pace to the far turn racing about the two or three path and weakened into the lane. MISS REVEILLE
stalked the leaders three or four wide and lacked a final closing bid. MISS ELLIE'S GIRL was not a threat three and four wide. TICKET TO RICHES saved
ground and had no rally. GOLD ZEPHYR followed the pace four wide and tired.

MAVALOUS MAVALOUS on the pace outside SHAY'S GLORY to late backstretch, kicked clear through the far turn then held safe under steady urging.
SHAY'S GLORY dueled inside the winner and could not go with that one nearing the lane. RUN'N DOWN A DREAM stalked the leaders four wide and could
only hold position in the lane. MS COMEDY TIME saved ground back off the early pace, swung out turning for home and moved up to narrowly miss third.
LILFEATHEREDINDIAN saved ground and failed to mount a bid. MUWAAN MAT was four and five wide through the first turn, moved up while angling in
going to the far turn and weakened. EVADE followed the pace four wide and weakened.

GIVE EM FITZ was on the early pace outside KINLEY CASH to bid into the far turn and gain a short lead, remained about the four path into the lane and
held safe under steady handling. CHEVERIE stalked the pace three or four wide, swung outside the winner into the lane but could not run that one down.
DISTINCT FLIRT was just off the pace along the inside, angled three wide on the far turn but lacked a final closing run. IRISH CONTESSA failed to mount a
bid racing two to three wide. KINLEY CASH was on the early lead about the two or three path and weakened in the far turn. INNOCENT STORM followed
the pace three to four wide and weakened. SIDEPOCKET BET was not a threat. A KISS GOODNIGHT was always back.

Footnotes
CLEARLY CLASSY dueled on the lead outside HOLIDAY CHIMES and dug in through the lane to keep that foe safe. HOLIDAY CHIMES dueled inside the
winner throughout and narrowly missed. GIVE EM SHADE was just off the leaders out from the rail and lacked a final closing run. MISS TATER TOT went
evenly three wide. RUN AND TELL DAT failed to mount a bid four wide. HANNAH'S STORM was last away, went wide in the turn and fanned eight wide
into the lane. DIXIE TRIXIE chased the leaders three wide and weakened. SWEET ECLIPSE was five wide through the turn and no factor. TOP OF THE
PODIUM was always back and fanned seven wide into the lane. BACK IN THE DAY trailed along the inside.
