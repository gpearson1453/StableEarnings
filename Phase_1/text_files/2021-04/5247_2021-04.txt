LEGAL WEAPON set a pressured early pace, went three wide into the turn, opened up and drew off as an easy winner. NEWELL pressed the early pace,
went four wide into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. BROTHER BEAUCHAMP raced in mid pack early, raced along the inside into the
turn and was along for third. CIEN POR CIEN stalked the early pace, angled out five wide out of the turn and was empty late. KEATON was reluctant to
load, was unhurried early, went five wide into the turn and never fired. CURBSIDE PICKUP was void of speed, went four wide into the turn and offered no
late rally. DEPUTY KNIGHT was taken back and was no factor. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

MUSKET POWDER tracked the early pace, went four wide into the second turn, took a brief lead, met the bid of COOL HAND LUCAS dueled with that rival
to the wire and prevailed. COOL HAND LUCAS raced in mid pack early, raced along the inside into the home turn, drifted out through the stretch, made a
bid on the winner, dueled to the wire and just missed. COURAGEOUS was void of speed, raced seven wide through the second turn, was closing late and
was up for third. BEA'S BOY was allowed to settle early from the inside and flattened out. FISHEL was unhurried early, went six wide into the second turn
and offered no rally. KENJILOOKSLUCKY was taken back early, raced between rivals into the home turn and never fired. CAPTIVE KITTEN was unhurried
early, went five wide into the second turn and was no factor. BLAISIN' EAMON followed the early pace and faded. HEAVY FAVOR set a clear early pace
and retreated.
