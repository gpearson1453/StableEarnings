in the two path then rallied well through the stretch. ANGINETTI lacked speed inside, angled wide into the stretch and showed late energy. TERPEYE broke
very slowly, moved very wide and continued willingly while no threat. ARTEMIS RISING quickly took control, led to the quarter pole then weakened. NEW
JERSEY lacked speed outside and failed to rally. STEPPING FORWARD saved ground down the backstretch then gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
ATINA SALSA away alertly to set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, shook free on her own, responded when roused in upper stretch,
then dug in gamely late to hold on. ALWAYS A QUEEN was off a step slow, raced three wide off the pace, advanced between rivals at the quarter pole,
rallied outside in the final furlong and closed well late. LORDEN'S LOVE raced two wide off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn and rallied mildly on
the rail. SWEET BLAME raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn and lacked a rally. COLLOQUIUM pressed the pace from the outside, chased on
the far turn and tired. BROAD STORM raced three wide early, then four wide off the pace and failed to threaten. MONACO PRINCESS raced off the pace
inside and was outrun. PER RULING FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, COLLOQUIUM WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

AUDIENCE OF ONE saved ground throughout, bid on the turn and edged away through the stretch under moderate urging. MY DANZIG PARTNER set the
pace outside, drew clear on the turn then weakened in the stretch. BOSTON LIGHT raced off the leaders in the two path and continued willingly. FORT
ROYAL moved eagerly into the far turn then flattened out in the lane. IRISH ROAR (IRE) raced outside, moved very wide on the turn and in the stretch.
LOUIE'S WISH lacked speed and was never in contention. TOMASCO prompted the pace just off the inside and faltered after half a mile. THE MINIT I SEE
U dropped back after the start and was always outrun. SUNRISE SATURDAY trailed early and raced far back throughout.

Footnotes
COOPER PENNY broke slowest, advanced very wide, led into the stretch, and edged off under steady drive. BARN QUEEN raced off the pace between
rivals, bid through traffic and offered a late bid. TALE OF KITTEN made a four wide move to contention before the half, led at the quarter pole.
LEFTATTHEALTAR raced close up faded on the final turn, moved wide into the stretch. LADY CARMELA saved ground just off the leaders and lacked a
rally. PAGE ELEVEN set the pace inside to midway on the final turn and faltered. WANNA BE REGAL dropped back early and never menaced. CANDY
TUNE SPIRIT lacked speed and raced far back throughout. FASHION NOVA prompted the pace under a rating hold then stopped after half a mile.
