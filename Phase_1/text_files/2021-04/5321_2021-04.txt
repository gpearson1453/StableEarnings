Footnotes
DARIA'S ANGEL set the pace under pressure to her inside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, shook clear at the five-sixteenths, extended the
advantage into upper stretch, drew off under the crop while drifting out a bit into the final furlong and proved much the best under a brisk hand ride to the
wire. VIOLENT TRICK was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back at the
five-sixteenths, shifted three wide into the stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and safely secured the place. PECAN PATTIE broke extremely
awkwardly then was taken up while ducking in, had the rider lose his left iron briefly and spotted the front many lengths, settled towards the rear, was urged
in the two path on the turn then driven three wide into the stretch, moved in near the furlong marker and earned the show. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY settled
in third position, was urged along late on the backstretch, chased in the four path on the turn and tired. PEACHES AND SPICE broke a step slow, lagged at
the rear while urged along on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
BRICCO three wide through the first turn, settled just off the pace five paths off the inside behind the cover of VODKA LEMONADE, tucked three wide three
furlongs from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took over command swinging four then three wide into upper stretch, dug in tussling with
VODKA LEMONADE to the eighth pole before edging clear to the finish kept to task. GHOSTMON three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the place honors. VODKA LEMONADE forwardly placed three
wide through the opening bend, raced five paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader advancing to take over the front half a mile from home, tucked to
the two path three furlongs out, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under pressure for the initial time and yielded command narrowly spinning two to
three wide for home, dug in under a drive battling on to the eighth pole before weakening in the late stages. JADE'S DREAM coaxed from the gate, chased
just off the inside from mid pack, tucked inside at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. BOURBON BROWN broke
out a step at the start brushing SECOND FORTUNE, raced just off the inside through the first turn before tipping to the four path down the backstretch,
tucked back to the two path through the far turn, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. LOULOVESTHERIVER just off the inside
through the first turn, went six paths off the inside down the backstretch, came under coaxing tucked four wide at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into
upper stretch and made no late headway. SECOND FORTUNE brushed at the start by BOURBON BROWN, who broke out a step, pulled on the bit early on
under rating and sputtered four wide into the first turn before settling three wide through that bend, went six paths off the inside down the backstretch behind
the cover of the aforementioned foe, tucked three wide through the far turn, continued three wide into upper stretch, lugged in straightened away and was
paused scraping the paint and offered no response. SOLAR ZEN showed brief speed establishing the front and showing the way in hand just off the inside
through the first turn and then three paths off the rail down the backstretch with rivals in close attendance, yielded the front at the half mile pole and
retreated through the far turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. BEDAZZLING along the inside through the first turn, chased three then two wide
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. LORENZEN just off the inside through the first turn, chased
five then four wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, went five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DANCING BUCK moved in early then settled on the outside while given cover, tucked into the two to three path on the turn, was roused then rallied four
wide into the stretch, took over before the three-sixteenths, kicked clear under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, switched to a left-handed crop while
still clear outside the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. DR. BLUTE was rated off the pace under tight restraint, drafted behind horses while
saving ground under a snug hold on the turn, was asked while three wide into the stretch, steadied while blocked behind horses around the three-sixteenths,
found room outside the eighth-pole, rallied in the final furlong and closed strongly but was too late while narrowly able to get the place. THREE OUTLAWS
bumped hard with a rival at the start, settled towards the inside, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, shifted four wide into the stretch,
was roused nearing the three-sixteenths, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed well to just miss the place while clear for the show. CITY MISCHIEF
bumped hard with an opponent at the start then checked, settled towards the rear, went three to four wide on the turn, was roused five wide into the stretch,
chased in striking position into the final furlong but lacked the needed kick. BARDOLINO was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the outside, vied
in the three path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, moved out behind the winner near the furlong marker and weakened. OUR
TROUBADOUR bumped hard with rivals on both sides at the start then steadied while pinched back, settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn, swung
six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BIG WONDER was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the inside of a rival then two foes late on the
backstretch, vied along the rail while still inside two opponents on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and capitulated. HALF RIGHT
tracked the leading duo early, moved up to make a bid between those foes inside the half-mile pole, vied between horses in the two path on the turn,
dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
THE GREAT DANSKY coaxed from the gate, established the front after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure through the
presence of a pair to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole under threat, dug in under a drive dueling
through the final furlong to the finish and gamely clung to command to prevail on the wire. HONORABLE SERVICE four then three wide in aim of the front,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced to intensify the pressure through the latter portion of the turn issuing a challenge swinging three
wide for home, dug in under a drive dueling through the final eighth latched on to the aforementioned foe to the outside but was ultimately denied at the end.
MINE THE COIN lunged at the start getting away a beat slow, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. HERO'S HOPE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked to the rail half a mile from home,
came under coaxing midway on the turn, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. CLIFFY led early on before
prompting the pace from the outside three then two wide between foes, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got shaken off near the quarter pole and
went three to four wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. FIRE MISSION walked out of the gate brushing the near side stall and quickly grew
detached from the main body of the field while put to an off side stick and hustled, chased three paths off the rail down the backstretch before tucking inside
through the turn, went three wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

GIANT SHOES pinched back at the start due to mostly pressure from MY FIRST GRAMMY coming inwards under coaxing, chased four to five wide down
the backstretch from near the rear, began to advance nearing the turn and tucked three wide through the bend ranging up to take command at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone growing threat to the outside and
held safe to prevail. MILLEAN bumped at the start by PROFUSION, who broke inwards, raced briefly inside before tipping two then three wide as MY FIRST
GRAMMY tucked inwards from the outside, got eased back once more as rivals shifted five furlongs from home, came under coaxing three wide at the
three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and offered up a good finish to come charging late latching on the aforementioned foe as he hit the
finish. PROFUSION broke in a step at the start bumping MILLEAN, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three wide into
upper stretch offering up a mild bid, couldn't sustain the move and weakened in the late stages while along clear for the show honors. MY FIRST GRAMMY
coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace from the two path, tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into
upper stretch and weakened in the late going. END ALL GET ALL showed the way in hand five then four wide, tucked to the two path through the turn and
came under coaxing at the three-eighths under pressure from flanking rivals, yielded near the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and weakened.
LITTERBOX five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. TRUE
PALACE chased along the inside in aim of the front, bounced off the rail inside the half mile pole and paused, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths,
took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. CURLIN'S KNIGHT coaxed from the start, chased four paths off the inside in range of the leader,
tucked to the two path through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, lost his action a bit nearing the eighth pole and was placed to a protective
hold and eased through to the finish walking across the wire at the end, and was subsequently walked off.

Footnotes
DEVIOUS MO brushed with a rival at the start while hustled, was well placed just behind the leader, moved forward on the turn, took the lead inside the
three-eighths, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole then was asked at the top of the stretch, was put to a right-handed crop just inside the
three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, drifted out some late then was straightened by the rider and held sway. SINFUL
DANCER brushed the inside of the gate at the start, was taken in hand early, steadied while swerving out behind another steadying rival outside the
five-eighths then jostled with that foe, settled on the outside, was asked while five wide on the turn, dropped to the three path late on that bend, pursued the
winner in the stretch, gained on that foe late but missed while well clear for the place. IT'S GRAVY settled off the pace, was urged along while inside to the
two path on the turn, moved out under a drive outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. MARKET ALERT
tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. LOBSTA was loaded into the six stall well prior to
post time to adjust the bridle then was backed out, came away in good order from the outside post, showed the way down the backstretch, came under
pressure in the two path on the turn, lost the lead outside the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated. WRITER'S REGRET brushed
with a rival at the start while hustled, raced just off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and faltered. PAPA
SMOOTH steadied outside the five-eighths then jostled with a foe while dropping back, went six wide on the turn and also faltered.

Footnotes
HARD LOVE forwardly placed along the inside early on and through the first turn, tipped to the two path down the backstretch as the leader took to the
inside and tracked that rival in closest aim latched on to the outside, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three
wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, dug in under a drive knocking heads with ORIGINAL taking narrow command a furlong from home, then
edged away to the finish kept to task. IT'S A GAMBLE tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. ORIGINAL established command shortly after the start and showed the way just off
the inside through the first turn before tucking to the inside into the backstretch briefly safely clear of HARD LOVE, got attended by that rival to the outside
facing little pressure save for that foe's presence until the five-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch let out for the drive, dug in head to head and was collared a furlong from home, then weakened in the very late going. EXTRASEXYBIGDADDEE
chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MINUTEMAN (GER) saved
ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no kick.
SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and offered no
rally. SIFTING SANDS (GB) settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to go, angled three to four wide into
upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
SASSY MELISSA settled comfortably off the pace, moved from three to five wide on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole, rallied on the outside, closed
fast to get the lead nearing the furlong marker and held off the fast closing runner-up under strong urging. TALES I WINIT settled near the middle of the
field, went around the turn in the two path, shifted four wide into the stretch then moved further out from behind horses, rallied outside into the final furlong
and closed determinedly to just miss while clear for the place. MILL STONE CREEK showed good speed, disputed the pace down the backstretch, vied
along the rail on the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked while able to get the show.
WILLOW GROVE settled under some urging, went three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and finished willingly while improving position but
lacked the needed kick. REELEY PSYCHED bumped with a rival at the start while last away then was taken up, was urged along at the rear, went two then
three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished with late energy. DOYOUKNOWWHOIAM showed good speed, disputed the pace on the
outside then in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. ORMA was carried out at the start then bumped
with a foe, stalked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the four path on the turn, chased into the stretch under the crop, dropped back into the final
furlong and tired. MENZAMENZ broke out at the start, was well spotted just off the pace, saved ground while asked on the turn and came up empty. LA
REINE ROUGE was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. CALL ME CARMELITA broke in and bumped with an
opponent, was urged along on the outside, dropped back five wide on the turn and also failed to respond. MS. GUCCI GIRL bumped with a rival at the start
then dropped back, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor.
