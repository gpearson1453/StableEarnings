Footnotes
AUSSIE MIST quickly moved clear inside, controlled the pace, repelled a strong challenge in mid stretch and edged away again. FLASHING DIAMOND bid
in the two path on the turn, reached near even terms but was outfinished. CANOOCHEE dropped well back inside then offered some late energy. LINDA'S
BALLET stalked the pace wide early, angled to the rail on the turn and faded. MISS STAR LO prompted the leader three wide through the opening quarter
then stopped. MRS. CREWS lunged badly at the start unseating her rider. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race.

stretch, rallied. NOBLE KENT moved closer outside after half mile, led at the quarter pole then tired late. KID MAC COOL chased the loose pacesetter
inside and proved empty in the stretch. CASTLE CASANOVA raced in closest pursuit of the leader to midway on the turn, steadied briefly tiring. WORTH
HIS SALT hustled to the front inside, vied through the final turn then faltered. A claim of foul by the rider of CASTLE CASANOVA against the rider of NOBLE
KENT for interference near the top of the stretch was dismissed.

IT'S SO EASY stalked two wide, moved up nearing the far turn, bid two wide on the turn, quickly took charge, pulled away and widened through the lane,
handily. JUSTIN TIME set the pace on the inside, opened up a clear lead, could not go with the winner on the far turn, then dug in and saved the place spot.
MY QUEEN MICHELLE raced off the pace, advanced three wide on the far turn, rallied mildly and earned the show award. TOKYO raced four wide on the
first turn, stalked four wide on the backside, moved up near the inside on the far turn and weakened in the lane. RIVER SONATA raced three wide on the
first turn, stalked three wide on the backside and tired. JANELLE DREAMS raced off the pace, three wide on the far turn and did not factor. NATOMA
steadied after the start, pulled entering the clubhouse turn, then tracked inside, chased and gave way.

CELTIC TREASURE pursued his stablemate outside, vied through the final turn then edged away late under steady pressure. ECLIPSED MOON trailed
well behind, advanced wide on the final turn and stretch and closed strongly. FLATEXCEL hustled from the gate, angled to the rail after the quarter, led and
tired in the final furlong. TRILOGY prompted the leaders three wide, dueled on the turn and finished willingly. LUVINMEISEASY lacked speed outside, was
asked for run on the final turn but had no rally. LEGAL GUMP was reserved inside for half a mile then gradually faded. DRUMMER DON injured himself in
the paddock and was ordered scratched by the stewards.

SHERO stalked close up in the two path, bid on the far turn, took over, drew off under right handed urging and then was taken in hand for the final yards.
ALWAYS A QUEEN raced off the pace, moved up inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch and was well clear for the place spot.
SQUAN'S KINGDOM raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn, was carried out wide at the quarter pole, then gained mildly outside. MIA BELLA
ROSSA raced three wide off the pace, moved up on the far turn, came two wide into the lane and lacked a rally. EVIL WOMAN raced off the pace between
rivals, chased on the far turn, was carried out wide passing the quarter pole and failed to threaten. OCEANO ROSSO raced three wide early, set the pace
on the inside, dueled briefly with the winner on the far turn, drifted out bothering rivals at the quarter pole and tired.

SWIFT FACTOR took control early, drifted in deep stretch and remained safe to the finish under steady handling. PRETTY PANTS unseated her rider and
ran off prior to the start, bid wide on the turn then raced greenly through the stretch. CHRISTINE'S COSMO chased inside to mid stretch, altered course
outside and was edged for the place. LADY RYAN broke slowest, raced far back then showed some late energy. ONE FOR SURE bumped from the outside
at the start, raced wide and was no factor. VICTORIA BELLE flashed speed down the backstretch and stopped abruptly. A claim of foul by the second
finisher against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.
