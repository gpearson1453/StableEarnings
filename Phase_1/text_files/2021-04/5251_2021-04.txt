JUNGLE BOY stalked the pace while saving ground two wide through the turn, collared the pace setter heading into the drive and kicked clear late. LUCA'S
RIDE settled midpack in the early stages, was still midpack while chasing the leaders three wide on the turn, angled out for the drive and while running on
his left lead made a late bid for second. BACKSTREET'S BACK stalked the early pace, three wide on the turn while still close up, swung widest into stretch
and was just nipped on the line by LUCA'S RIDE for third. SIZZLING INDIAN set early fractions while saving ground, began to tire heading into the drive and
had no late response in the stretch. BLOOD RED MOON was off a step slow leaving the gate, had no speed through the early stages while saving ground,
and was not a threat in the stretch run. TEXAS BOB settled toward the back of the field early, saved ground on the turn while still toward the rear, and had
no late rally in the stretch run.

Footnotes
WARM SUMMER broke alertly, then chased the early pace through the backstretch run, was three wide along the turn while still chasing the pace,
confronted CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP nearing the sixteenth pole, wore down that rival and held on for the win. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL was unhurried early, three
wide along the turn while still at the rear of the field, found running room at the top of the stretch and put in a bold late move in the final stages to pressure
the winner, while holding on to second. THIS IS THE ONE stalked the early pace from a two wide position along the turn, was headed by two other rivals at
the top of the stretch, was asked for run and was nipped late for second. HABOBANERO chased the early pace while saving ground, lost position while still
saving ground along the turn, mounted a mild late bid in the stretch but could not go on with that run and was outkicked late. TONI TWO POCKET was
pinched at the start by neighboring horses, settled toward the rear of the field, moved up to be close to the lead nearing the eighth pole and weakened late.
CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP set fractions from a ground saving trip early, was pressured on the lead by THIS IS THE ONE, was asked for run entering the
stretch, was confronted by WARM SUMMER nearing the sixteenth pole and tired in the late stages.

ANNIE GRAHAM had good speed to press the pace outside of TIL I FOUND YOU, was four wide to the stretch then responded determinedly and wore
down that one to prevail. TIL I FOUND YOU hustled to the front, set the pace three wide to the stretch, resisted the winner to inside the furlong grounds then
was an easy second. CHEATER'S WALTZ had no speed, saved ground to the stretch then was offering a mild bid late. SHOUT IT OUT chased the top two,
had to swing out five deep into the stretch but failed to threaten. THE GREAT HAYNES also had no speed, was four wide to the stretch then did not rally.
STREET DANCING was chasing to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch but weakened through the lane. LAST INNING got outsprinted, was three wide to
the stretch then gave way. LOCHMARA broke awkwardly and was always outrun. BOWLMAGEDDON was through early, stopped, was eased in the stretch
and walked off.
