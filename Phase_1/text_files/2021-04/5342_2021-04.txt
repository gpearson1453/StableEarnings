Footnotes
BAYTOWN FROSTY broke sharply and set the pace along the inside, inched clear turning for home before being roused at the three sixteenths pole, hung
on his left lead through upper stretch before changing inside the furlong pole while shifting to the two path, then safely fended off TEJANO TWIST's rail
charge, and lasted from OVERBORE's belated rush. TEJANO TWIST lied off of the pace along the inside, tipped two wide at the five sixteenths pole before
shifting back inwards at the three sixteenths marker, pinched and bothered ASK THE UMPIRE in the process, but sustained a rail rally to attempt a late bid,
but was fended off and just held place. OVERBORE hopped while off a step slowly at the start, then bobbled behind soon after, trailed the field around the
turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, then to the five path at the three sixteenths pole, produced a stout kick and unleashed a furious rally through the
final furlong under hand urging, but ran out of ground to catch the leaders. OFFALY FAST pressed two wide while under steady urging, chased the leader
through upper stretch, and faded through the late stages. TREBBIANO tracked from midpack three wide, came into the lane between horses while chasing
the leaders, and failed to rally. LA FLECHA saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. ASK THE UMPIRE stalked along the inside, but failed to keep
pace with the leaders turning for home, steadied when put to tight quarters by TEJANO TWIST at the three sixteenths pole, and was protected thereafter.
FLEET KISS lied far off of the pace two wide, and never got involved. STORM SEQUENCE tracked from midpack four wide, but faded on his left lead in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
HEY KITTEN stalked the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane, split horses near the three sixteenths pole then shot to the lead, drifted out entire drive
and cleared the field further in the final stages. HAT TIP was bumped at the start and trailed the field early on, was in the seven path into the lane, rallied
down the lane, made a bid inside the eighth pole but hung in the late stages. TEMPEREYA raced back early on, was on the inside along the far turn, swung
into the six path entering the lane, rallied in the stretch and moved up in the late stages. MY CANDY GIRL tracked the pace early on, was in the three path
into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. CAMELLIA GAL came out and bumped foe at the start, raced back early on, raced in the five path into
the lane, was bothered nearing the eighth pole and weakened late in the drive. ARTISTIC JEWLER was in the four path into the lane and improved position
down the lane. FASHION ICON was bumped at the start, chased the pace early, was in the six path into the lane and empty in the stretch run. LADY
JENNEVIERE was never a threat. THUNDER BUGGY broke awkwardly and was bumped at the start, was rushed up along the first turn widest, took over
and had a clear lead along the backstretch, raced along the inside into the lane and folded up in the stretch drive. SKYVALUE set the pace along the first
turn but was quickly overtaken, raced in the three path into the lane, was in tight and bothered once in the stretch and tired down the lane.

THE CONNECTOR broke outwardly and brushed a rival, set the pace along the inside, stayed a path off of the inner railing around the turn, met STAR OF
KODIAK's rail bid at the three sixteenths pole while inching away from his outer pressing counterpart, repulsed that foe inside the final furlong, and held
firmly to the wire. OAK HILL was brushed by an inner foe at the start before bumping an outer rival soon after, recovered to rush early on to prompt the pace
setter from the outside, got kept in the three path around the turn by that foe, but failed to keep pace with him approaching the furlong pole, chased
thereafter, and caught STAR OF KODIAK on the wire to reclaim place. STAR OF KODIAK stalked along the inside, produced a rail bid at the three
sixteenths pole, but was turned away by the leader approaching the final sixteenth, then lost place close to the wire. AMERICAN MANDATE stalked two
wide from the three path around the turn, tipped outside of the leaders to the four path passing the quarter pole, but lacked a kick and faded. KINGPIN took
a bump from an inner foe soon after the start, lied off of hte pace in the two to three path around the turn before swinging five wide turning for home, but
failed to rally. SHACKLEFORD'S JOY trailed early on, took the turn in the four path and outside of foes, got floated six wide entering the lane, and failed to
factor.

Footnotes
MR. WALSH was off a step slowly, lied off of the pace in the four path into the turn, gained five wide turning for home to bid for the lead in upper stretch,
forged an advantage at the furlong pole, and drew clear thereafter. STRUTTINBUCK rated far off of the pace in the two to three path into the turn, attempted
to split rivals entering the lane, but clipped heels in tight quarters at the quarter pole causing a stumble, shifted out to the five path after the incident, rallied
while shifting back inwards in midstretch, and split foes to achieve place approaching the wire. CANT STOP THIS MAN was off a step slowly, tracked along
the inside under snug restraint, saved ground from midpack along the inside around the turn, altered course four wide in upper stretch, and stayed on for a
minor share. GOLDEN SPOKE lied close up along the inside, rated back to stalk from the pocket into the turn, tipped outside of the leader to produce a two
wide bid at the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage in upper stretch as MR WALSH ranged up alongside, but was headed by that foe at the furlong
pole, and tired. EPIMYTHIUM tracked from midpack five to four wide into the turn, but was brushed and faded at the five sixteenths pole. SOVEREIGN
CHANGE set the pace two wide, cleared to the rail into the turn, met a pair of bids entering the lane, and weakened in upper stretch. WHISKEY PLANK
prompted the pace three to two wide and from between horses, then faded turning for home. KICK SOME TALE was bumped at the start, and outrun.
PITAMAN broke outwardly and bumped a rival, lied forwardly placed four to three wide and from between horses, but brushed his outer rival while
weakening at the five sixteenths pole, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
NEVISIAN SUNRISE stalked along the inside, awaited racing room entering the lane, shifted outside of the leader at the three sixteenths pole, rallied to bid
passing the furlong grounds as COMMANDERS PALACE ranged up alongside, received a solid bump from that rival to be knocked off stride while forging
an advantage at the sixteenth grounds, and safely held from that foe late. COMMANDERS PALACE was off slowly, lied off of the pace in the two path
around the turns, shifted four wide entering the lane, rallied through midstretch while drifting inwards, produced a bid outside of NEVISIAN SUNRISE
approaching the sixteenth grounds, but severely bumped that foe at that marker, and was denied by that rival to the wire. FAYETTE BLUE set the pace
along the inside, shook clear at the three sixteenths marker, but met a pair of bids passing the furlong pole, and yielded to those rivals in the final sixteenth.
MS TEMPTATION tracked from midpack in the two to three path around the first turn, held stalking position around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with
the leaders in upper stretch, then kept on to save a minor share. CONFIDENT was slow into stride and lagged behind the field early on, saved ground
around the turns, then improved through the lane. MARIA'S REVENGE took both turns in the three path while far off of the pace, and failed to factor.
SWEET WORKOUT pulled around the first turn to vie for the lead three to two wide, maintained vying position while staying a path from his inner
counterpart around the far turn, then faded at the three sixteenths pole. TAKE A PEAK prompted the pace two wide into the first turn, rated back into the
backstretch to stalk from between horses, but weakened in upper stretch. KITSIE tracked from midpack in the three to four path around the first turn, but
faded five wide in upper stretch. EMPIRE TROLLEY lied off of the pace along the inside, but was done early. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF
COMMANDERS PALACE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF NEVISIAN SUNRISE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG, BUT IT
WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.
