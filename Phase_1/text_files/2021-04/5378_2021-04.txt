Footnotes
NAPA SPIRIT (IRE) chased the pace early on, was in the five path into the lane, rolled up to the leaders three wide near the eighth pole and after putting
away both foes inched clear in the final stages. JACK BACKED tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid from between horses
but hung in the late stages and lasted for place at the wire. CREATIVE KID chased the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the
lane and just missed place at the wire. CHEYENNE WIND raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run.
MAGNILOQUENT set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, remained clear in the upper stretch but was quickly overtaken near the eighth pole and
faltered in the final stages. CODE CLEAR was a bit slow at the start and trailed the field early on, was in the four path into the lane and improved position
down the lane. ON SPOT raced a bit rank early on and was no factor. BAYTOWN WARRIOR was a bit slow at the start then was rushed up along the
inside, raced off the rail into the lane and faded in the stretch drive. GRUMPA was never a threat. LIVERYMAN was a bit slow at the start, steadied into the
turn and was tired down the lane.

Footnotes
HEADLINE REPORT was a beat slow from the gate then rushed up to vie for the lead two wide, raced in the three path into the lane, was confidently
handled down the lane and cleared the field in the final stages while ridden out. CONAGHER hopped at the start, stalked the pace early on, was in the four
path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but was no match for the winner in the late stages. LA BELLEZA NEGRA set the pace from the inside, was off
the rail into the lane and gave in down the lane. CACHIRULO chased the pace from the outside, was in the six path into the lane and weakened late in the
stretch run. WARRIOR WORRIER was done early and raced in the five path into the lane.

Footnotes
FLORIFORM bobbled at the start, tracked the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch and won the nod at the wire.
CELLIST was a bit slow at the start, made a middle move along the backstretch, cleared the field nearing the lane, was put under a long drive down the lane
and was out-nodded at the wire. CREW DRAGON was steadied along the first turn, chased the pace, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the
stretch but flattened out late in the drive. BLUE CAT was bumped at the start, chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and moved up in the
stretch run. PRIVATE ISLAND tracked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. CATMAN chased the
pace early, was off the rail into the lane and faded down the lane. KOBLA MAS was bumped at the start, raced in the three path into the lane. SHADY
MCGEE (IRE) was keen into the first turn, fought restraint along the first turn. DONEGAL BAY set the pace for a half then folded up.

Footnotes
PUYE TIMING took a bump from an outer foe into an inner foe at the start, recovered to set the pace along the inside, felt mild pressure from ILL MAKE IT
COACH down the backstretch, drew clear turning for home, and held sway under driving pressure. SPEIGHTFUL CHARGE stalked along the inside, but
failed to keep pace with the clear leader turning for home, then chased that rival home well through the lane. I'LL MAKE IT COACH broke inwards and
bumped a rival at the start, prompted the pace setter from the outside while applying mild pressure, but failed to keep pace with that foe at the five
sixteenths pole, and chased between rivals through the lane. CELESTIAL SPIN lied at the rear of the field two wide, progressed three wide around the far
turn to a stalking position entering the lane, but leveled off in upper stretch. MY BETS saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. ANN IN THE MIDDLE
was bumped and forced inwards at the start by an outer rival, tracked from midpack two wide early on, but faded into the far turn and was done early.

Footnotes
BAKERS BAY comfortably stalked along the inside, shifted out from behind the leaders to the four path approaching the three sixteenths pole, rallied to bid
for the lead outside of the trio of leaders inside the final furlong, dueled outside of KENTUCKY GHOST approaching the wire, and prevailed. KENTUCKY
GHOST saved ground from midpack, awaited racing room while contemplating angling out entering the lane, but decided on a rail rally passing the quarter
pole as the leader vacated the inside, slipped inside of that rival to produce a bid at the furlong pole, forged ahead in the final sixteenth to sustain a duel
inside of the bidding BAKERS BAY, but was outfinished. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE set the pace along the inside, shifted off of the rail in upper stretch to resist
BOTSWANA's bid, but met KENTUCKY GHOST's challenge in the process, dug in through midstretch between those foes, but was outkicked by his inner
counterpart and an outer rallying rival at the sixteenth grounds, then held show. CONVICTION TRADE lied far off of the pace three wide around both turns,
gained while swinging five wide turning for home, and sustained a rally for a minor share. BOTSWANA prompted the pace two wide, vied three wide through
midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer foe and an inner rival passing the furlong grounds, and tired late. CURRENT saved ground off of the pace, but to
no avail. STANFORD (IRE) lied off of the pace two wide around both turns, but failed to make an impact. BATTALION stalked two wide, shifted four wide in
upper stretch, but faded. OUR CLOSURE trailed early on, got rank between horses crossing the wire for the first time, and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
SIBELIUS dueled for the lead inside of SAMS TIME, shook clear of that foe at the quarter pole, and held firm through the lane. CASUAL AFFAIR lied off of
the pace, gained four wide around turn, then sustained that rally through the final furlong, but ran out of ground to reel in the leader. SAMS TIME bumped an
outer rival in the opening furlong, dueled for the lead outside of SIBELIUS, but failed to keep pace with that foe passing the quarter pole, and kept on well
through the lane. YEARN FOR VICTORY was bumped by an inner rival early on, stalked four wide, retreated to midpack into the turn, took the bend in the
three path, then stayed on to surpass tiring foes for a minor share. BUFFALO SHUFFLE received a bump between horses in the opening furlong, prompted
the pace three wide, but faded into the turn. BAYOU GEM was bumped between horses early on, tracked from midpack two wide, but was shuffled back
behind a tiring foe around the turn, but failed to rerally. TALL TIMBER was off slowly, advanced inside of foes to midpack around the turn, but flattened out
through the lane. MAJESTIC SUMMER lied far off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and failed to make an impact. SUPPRESSOR lied forwardly
placed along the inside, but weakened between horses into and around the turn, and was done early. KOLSCH saved ground far off of the pace, but to no
avail. NEVER EXPLAIN lied far off of the pace in the five path around the turn, and never got involved. NIAGARA SKYLINE got caught six wide around the
turn while at the rear of the field, and was outrun.

Footnotes
WAR LIKE GODDESS saved ground while rating far off of the pace, smoothly tipped off of the rail turning for home before swinging five wide in upper
stretch, produced an electrifying turn of foot when let out passing the three sixteenths pole, blew past the group of leaders at the furlong pole, drew clear
approaching the final sixteenth, and was wrapped up. DELTA'S KINGDOM tracked from midpack in the two path, inched forward four wide around the far
turn, sustained that rally to bid on her left lead at the furlong pole, but was outkicked by an outer foe at that marker, then held place. PASS THE PLATE lied
at the rear of the field along the inside, then two wide into the second turn, shifted out four wide in midstretch, and rallied to miss place on the wire.
KALIFORNIA QUEEN (GER) saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, and stayed on late. DALIKA (GER) stalked three wide,
got keen under firm restraint through the lane for the first time, maintained striking position outside of the leading pair around the far turn, bidi n upper
stretch, but was outkicked by outer rivals at the furlong pole. DOMINGA stalked two wide, vied around the third bend, sustained vying postion between
horses in upper stretch, then weakened through the final furlong. THREE FLAMINGOS set the pace along the inside, vied inside of a rival around the far
turn, then weakened inside of a group of rivals in upper stretch. MARGARET'S JOY lied off of the pace two to three wide around the turns, but failed to
factor. ENGLISH AFFAIR lied at the rear of the field two to three wide, and failed to factor. COURT RETURN lied far off of the pace two to three wide, then
four wide around the far turn, but never got involved. CAMBELIZA saved ground while forwardly placed around all turns, but faded through the lane.
