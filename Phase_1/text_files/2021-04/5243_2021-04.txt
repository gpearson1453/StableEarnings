Footnotes
SHE'S FIRE AND ICE behind the pace while inside, patiently handled while continuing to save ground through the turn, slipped through inside the leader
when straightened for home, put a head in front just inside the furlong grounds and kicked clear under steady handling. AWESOME INDRA broke on top,
set the pace in the two path, narrowly showed the way out of the turn while allowing the winner the inside upper stretch, could not match that one late, held
sway for the place. SUGAR LOVE prompted the pace while racing four wide, remained in a striking position exiting the turn, came up empty for the stretch
run, outkicked for the place. BLINKERS forwardly placed while outside the runner up, between rivals turning for home, gave way.

Footnotes
CLEARLY MAD in the second flight in the two path, tipped out when called on for a bit of turn, late in the bend, engaged the leader from the outside in
midstretch and wore that rival down under steady handling. TOIL AND TROUBLE broke alertly, dueled up the backstretch and into the turn, put a head in
front early in the turn, put the other speed away just as the winner was challenging on the outside nearing the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to that
rival, clearly second best. TALKTOEACHOTHER dueled up front while racing in the two path and outside the runner up, could not match that one when
straightened for home, comfortably held the show. HONIARA off a step slow, saved ground off the pace, went evenly in the drive to pose no threat to the top
three. MAJESTIC DAY fell back to trail after the start, four wide through the turn, passed some tiring rivals while also not a serious threat. SAMURAI SAINT
lacked speed while racing three wide, failed to menace. CONFESS within striking distance while racing outside, began to fade before a half. MYSTIC
PHAROAH off a step slow, then was bothered, moved up to improve early, had little for the drive just off the inside.

Footnotes
FABULOUS GIRL closest to the leader early, went after that rival far turn, took over, shrugged off a second foe turning into the lane, kicked well clear under
steady handling. BIG TINY settled off the pace while saving ground, continued inside, angled out around a tiring rival turning into the stretch, finished
willingly from between horses to be up for the place, rider rode well past the wire. HUSH Y'ALL lacked speed, came three wide into the stretch, rallied
outside the runner up, outkicked by that one for the place spot. INDIAN BELLA settled off the pace, moved closer three wide outside the winner midway on
the final turn, flattened out in the drive. SANTA ANA WINDS off slowly, trailed early, raced three wide when making a mild advance into the stretch,
improved position without posing a serious threat. MONKEY MIND void of speed, trailed early, improved position into the stretch, failed to sustain that
advance through the stretch. VEILAZIG settled off the pace and the inside, moved out four wide in the far turn, failed to muster a rally in the drive. JULIE
ARKANSAS broke on top, sprinted clear soon after, set a lively pace and stopped when headed midway on the final turn.

TANGO CHARLIE broke on top, sprinted clear. maintained daylight into the lane, kept to task with a left handed crop, drifted out slightly then lost said crop
late, held runner up safe in the final strides. MEGATAP forwardly placed while off the inside, moved a bit closer to the winner turning for home, drifted out
steadily past midstretch, failed to do much with that rival late. GOLD MONEY last away, trailed early inside, continued to save ground through the turn,
proved no match for the top two. AWESOME LAUNCH turned in an even effort while racing four wide. ARE YOU HAPPY lacked speed, dropped to the
inside early in the turn, saved ground to no avail. MEGA CHARLIE chased the winner in the early going, began a steady fade before a half.

Footnotes
YOU SPLIT TENS forwardly placed early along the inside, steadied midway up the backstretch when covered up along the rail, continued to save ground
while in the second flight through the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, dropped back to the rail late, finished with good energy up the inside to be clear late.
MINE MY TIME within striking distance off the inside, challenged between horses outside the early leader, continued to vie past the furlong marker, proved
no match for his entrymate late, prevailed for the place. UNSCATHED away in good order, vied up front while closest to the inside, continued to battle for
the pace, past the furlong marker, then proved stubborn to the end. IMPRESSIVE STUDENT prompted the pace while racing three wide, continued within
striking distance exiting the turn, came up empty for the drive. TENTWELVEFOURTEEN off the pace while well out in the strip, came four out to five wide
into the lane, managed little in the way of a late gain. REPLETE in mid pack while also well out in the strip, raced five out to six wide turning for home,
improved slightly without posing a serious threat. LOUDEN'S GRAY back off the pace while in the three path, remained three wide and in some traffic
through the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. RECOUNT within striking distance in the second flight toward the inside,
tired through the stretch. BAQUERO FLIES fell back after the start, lagged well back off the rail, failed to muster a response in the drive. GHOSTLY WHO
main body while widest, 6-7w late turn, remained back.

BASIC CHANCE broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, was given a breather through the turn, shook well clear in the drive
under steady handling. I BELONG TO BECKY forwardly placed inside and behind the winner, moved out for the drive, proved no match for the winner in the
drive, held sway for the place. JACK VAN BERG closest to the leader while off the inside, continued to pursue that one through the turn, proved no match in
the drive, was flat late, caught late for the place. SOMETHING SUPER fell back to trail, came in the two path into the stretch, staged a mild rally while inside
of several rivals. BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS in the second flight early, dropped inside for the run through turn, lacked late punch to finish up evenly. HE'S NO
BULL hopped at the start to spot the field a couple of lengths, raced back and outside, three wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick. HE'S MEANT TO
BE in mid pack for a half just off the inside, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
BAYSHORE FOXES never far back off the inside, crept closer three wide turning for home, dueled past the furlong marker, shook clear then held late under
brisk handling. SILVER'S YORK raced back off the pace and the inside, closer three wide in some traffic turning for home, roused when clear, finished
willingly to be up for the place. EDEN void of speed inside, steered out steadily to be three wide by late in the turn, rallied for the show, getting to the runner
up late. MUSIC APP broke sharp, dueled up front while racing in the two path, disposed of the other early speed by midway on the turn, weakened when
headed by the winner nearing the furlong grounds. WHAT'S NEWS away in good order, raced in mid pack while in the two path, continued one paced
through the stretch in lacking a closing response. GOLDEN EYED QUEEN moved up inside to help set a quick opening quarter, headed turn, continued to
falter through the lane. EVERYOTHERWON within striking distance outside, raced four wide through the turn, faded through the lane. BLAME THE RED
CAT last away, remained always back in showing little.

Footnotes
UNDECIDEDCERTAINTY broke back, moved boldly toward the front while in traffic turn, waited briefly late in the turn, moved out three entering the stretch,
took over, quickly clear, kept to task. KALLINIKI last to leave, trailed early, moved closer in traffic and inside the winner, also waited briefly, moved out wider
for the drive, finished willingly to be well clear for the place. MS FALSETTO forwardly placed off the inside, vied three wide and between foes turning into the
stretch, offered little resistance to the winner and runner up past the furlong marker, comfortably held the show. SING ALONG SUZY lacked speed, three
wide through the turn, steered in nearing midstretch, improved position while not a serious threat to the top three. COLLUDE broke in, back off the pace and
the inside, in some traffic midway up the backstretch, came six wide out of the turn, improved upper stretch only to flatten out the final furlong. BETWEEN
THE HEDGES broke alertly, vied up front while off the inside, between horses turn when holding a narrow advantage, faltered in the drive. WHOVILLE
broke well, with the pace along the inside, gave way in the drive. DIXIELAND DREAM within striking distance outside, five wide into the turn, four wide
exiting, gave way. JUSTATAPIN forwardly placed, staged a steady retreat off the inside.

Footnotes
WILLFUL WOMAN within striking distance, moved out three wide when advancing late in the final turn, engaged the two leaders when straightened for
home, finished with good energy to win going away at the end. TRUMPET LILLY chased the early leader, moved on that one midway on the second turn,
took over approaching the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner in the late going, held the place late under steady handling. EXOTIC WEST broke
with the field, worked way loose up front the opening quarter, rated snugly in the run up the backstretch, responded when the runner up came alongside in
the second turn, vied past the furlong marker, little left late, outkicked for the place spot, clearly best of the rest. SARIAH SARIAH void of speed, saved
ground through the final turn, had little left for the top three in the drive, finished up evenly. SHASTALOO settled in midpack, lacked a response in the drive.
ABSOLUTE ANNA off a step slow, trailed most of the way, picked off one tiring rival while never a factor. SISTER ANNIE finished early, stopped, fell far
back, jogged in.

Footnotes
BAILESTON LASSIE broke on top despite being bumped lightly at the break, vied early, cleared to inside into turn, shook clear, maintained daylight to the
wire under firm handling. FRENCH CHARM in mid pack while racing outside, four wide through much of the turn, rallied for the place while not a threat to
the winner. SUMMER LOVIN broke back, angled in a bit into the turn, three wide into the lane, mild interest, nod for show. TIGER BAIT forwardly placed
inside, shuffled back a bit late backstretch along the inside, continued to save ground turn, moved out a bit for the drive, showed some interest while
narrowly missing the show. ABRAMAX settled off the leaders and the inside, one pace three wide in lacking a closing response. BIG AFFAIR vied up front
early along the inside, fell back a bit into the turn, traffic late in the turn, had little for the stretch run. CITY GONE COUNTRY was never a threat. ALL IN
BRONSON off a step slow, remained always back. STYLIN UPTOWN prompted the pace for a half, gave way in the drive. LA PAQUITA finished early,
raced wide.
