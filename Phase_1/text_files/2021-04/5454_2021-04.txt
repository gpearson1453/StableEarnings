GRAND WISER set a clear pace in the two path and widened under a drive. KATHERN'S JOY chased the pace in the two path, angled three wide near the
quarter pole and was along late for the place. DR. ROGER was pulling while up close inside down the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn,
continued on the left lead in the lane and lost second late. MARISA'S MISSION failed to menace while racing four wide. JUGUETE stalked the pace four
wide and came up empty in the lane. WILD TEXAS TOM prompted the pace three wide between foes and retreated after a half. UNDER FIRE played no
factor while racing two wide. TESTATRIX lost contact, was pulled up around the turn and walked off. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH FRACTIONS
UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ESKIMO'S BOSS alternated for the lead inside KATIESDREAMGIRL for six furlongs, spurted away with some shakes of the reins into the stretch, and
stayed clear late under a mild drive. KATIESDREAMGIRL vied inside ESKIMO'S BOSS through easy early fractions, got shaken off once straightened away
for the drive, and had enough to save the place. FORBIDDEN DREAM raced two to three wide on the turns, bumped with CHICA BOOM while keeping that
one bottled up through the furlong grounds, and finished evenly. ART OF LAW saved ground and made no impact. CHICA BOOM fought rating inside first
time through the stretch, followed along saving ground to the top of the lane, bumped with FORBIDDEN DREAM while inside that one and behind
KATIESDREAMGIRL through midstretch, and was never set down in earnest. STARSHIP NUGGET was no factor two wide.

Footnotes
JESSICA set a rated pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch and widened under left-handed urging. ALIZEE was slammed at the start then
steadied soon after, advanced outside down the backstretch, made progress five wide around the turn but was no match for the winner in the lane.
INFATUATING prompted the pace three wide between foes, could not keep pace in upper stretch but churned on to save the show. LEVY LAND broke
inwardly and slammed ALIZEE at the start, saved ground off the pace and lacked the needed rally. HOLD THE APPLAUSE settled off the early pace
outside, bid four wide between foes nearing the lane and tired in the drive. AVENIDA MANANA was outrun in the three path.

Footnotes
SMOOTH PEBBLE hit the left side of the gate and bumped with TAMI'S ORCHID coming out, then bumped with GARNER STATE PARK, was reserved
early two wide, bid outside KARENVILLE at the top of the stretch, edged away a sixteenth out, swapped back to her left lead nearing the finish and
prevailed all out. KARENVILLE bumped with GARNER STATE PARK at the start, moved in from the three-path coming away with the lead on the first turn,
dug in when challenged turning for home and yielded grudgingly. TOURING EGYPT advanced three then two wide midway on the far turn, but could not
sustain the rally. GARNER STATE PARK bumped with KARENVILLE at the break, then bumped with SMOOTH PEBBLE a stride later, raced three to four
wide on the turns, and finished evenly. STARRY HOPE saved ground and failed to seriously menace. TAMI'S ORCHID was a step slow at the start, and
never reached contention. AWILDAS TREASURE eased back as KARENVILLE went by to grab the lead on the first turn, moved outside to follow along up
the backstretch, steadied getting shuffled back between horses midway on the far turn, and dropped far back through the lane. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
HOT BABE set a clear pace in the two path and held firm under a drive. FACTS ONLY chased the winner inside early, angled into the three path near the
three-eighths pole, stalked in the clear from there, could not seriously gain on the winner but was clearly second best. TRINNI GIRLS chased the pace four
wide, lacked a rally and bested the rest. OKALANI failed to menace while racing four and five wide. DANCING EMPRESS had brief speed three wide.
PARTY SWAGGER played no factor while racing two wide. TRAFUL was bumped at the start, had some speed four wide and retreated. SENORITA SALSA
was bumped at the start, had some speed inside and was through after a half. HOLY SECRET hopped at the start and made little impact inside. ADDI was
bumped between foes at the start, raced well back inside, swung five wide near the quarter pole and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
DIAMONDS ENJOY sped clear soon after the start, extended the advantage turning for home slightly removed from the rail, and continued to widen while
kept to a drive. IT'S A RISK pursued DIAMONDS ENJOY from outside, could not keep pace into the stretch, and had enough to hold on for second.
WICKED TEMPTATIONS raced four wide around the turn, and lacked the needed closing bid. STRONG ENDING was outsprinted through the opening
half-mile, moved to the far outside for the drive and improved for the last major share. SAINT LARNED bumped solidly with NIMBLE BEAST at the start,
saved ground outrun for a half, altered course outside in upper stretch, went back to the rail near the sixteenth-pole and posed no threat. NIMBLE BEAST
bumped solidly with SAINT LARNED at the start, rushed up early in the two-path, saved ground staying in range into the stretch, and tired. MR. CESCO
shifted out four wide midway on the turn, and tired. HANDSOME PRINCE raced three wide, and was through approaching the stretch.

REBELDE settled off the early pace inside, was drive along three wide nearing the three-eighths pole, moved to the front between foes near the quarter pole
and drew off under a drive. CREA'S BKLYN LAW raced off the pace four wide, bid outside of the winner nearing the quarter pole but proved no match for
that foe in the lane. CREATE AGAIN pressed the pace two wide, had a brief lead near the five-sixteenths pole and tired in the drive. IL FARAONE lagged
well back inside and passed tiring rivals. EXAMINER set a pressured pace inside an wilted nearing the lane. LIKE YOU stumbled at the start, chased the
pace four wide and was through after six furlongs.

Footnotes
MITZRAYIM settled in the middle of the field early, entered the stretch in the two-path behind the first flight, got through on the fence inside OUR STUIE
leaving the eighth-pole and kicked away late under a mild drive. CALL BROS moved off the inside around the first turn, followed behind the leaders waiting
for an opening on the far turn, shifted out for clearance with a bid in the four-path through the furlong grounds, and was outkicked by the top one. OUR
STUIE set the pace inside, drifted to the two-path in upper stretch, and was overtaken from both sides. COLTONSTHEADMIRAL came out at the break and
was slow into stride, advanced after a half-mile three then four wide, and rallied mildly outside for a slice. RANGER UP tracked outside the leaders three
wide, and tired in the stretch. BODIE CODY pressed the pace two wide, and steadied between horses while weakening in deep stretch. QUINTO SOL
saved ground early, moved out four wide near the quarter-pole, and made no headway. LITTLE TEQUILA was outrun two to three wide. GIMMEABREAK
broke awkwardly spotting the field a couple lengths, and remained at the rear.
