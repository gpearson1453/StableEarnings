to the inside, the rider lost his whip at the sixteenth pole when it was struck by the whip of the winning rider and just missed in a game effort. HILLBILLY
RICH unhurried early, closed fast four wide through deep stretch but was too late. DREAM PRIZES unhurried early, offered a strong bid along the rail into
the stretch, altered course three wide at the sixteenth marker and finished with good courage. KISS ME COWGIRL was outrun. THE MAN CAN hit the gate,
bore in and unseated his rider at the start. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

DREAM ON JILLY allowed to settle, closed willingly three wide in the six path through deep stretch and was along in time. WEE MONIE CREEK pressed
the pace two wide into the stretch, drew on even terms for the lead, bumped near the sixteenth pole, led late then couldn't handle the winner. MISS
SURPRISE away alertly, set a pressured pace into the stretch, shook clear, bumped with the winner up then was outfinished. JILLY FROM JERSEY failed
to menace. LADY KIM stalked the pace through the turn then faded. PUNAHELE was no factor. STONE ZONE was no threat. ROLLIN SO WICKED was
unprepared for the start, broke in a tangle and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ANGEL'S SASSY never far back, closed with a burst of speed along the rail to make the lead in upper stretch and drew off under right handed urging. LOVE
YOU GOODBYE away alertly, set the pace off the rail to upper stretch then was no match for the winner. CARMEN OHIO shifted to the six path soon after
the start then went evenly. GERTIE CAT failed to menace. HIGH CUPPER trailed into the stretch then passed tiring rivals along the rail. BEEBLEGEE was
no threat. MY PINK BABY BIRD was no factor. A SMILE A DAY chased the winner into the turn, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole,
remained a sharp threat into the stretch then was eased through the final furlong. UNIQUELY had brief speed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY
SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
