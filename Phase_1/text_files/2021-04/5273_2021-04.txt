Footnotes
PROUD VICTORIA behind the pace while racing three wide, slowly advanced on the lead pack late in the turn while angling out four wide, challenged into
the lane, wore the runner up down under steady handling. JOY IN THE JOURNEY with the pace while racing three wide, shook off the other speed to be
briefly clear exiting the turn, responded when the winner came alongside soon after, proved stubborn until late, clearly second best. FIVE QUEENS off the
pace and the inside, steered out to be three wide turning for home, finished up best of the rest while not a threat to the top two. SAVEDBYANANGEL with
the pace along the inside after breaking in good order, continued to contest the issue through the turn closest to the rail, gradually weakened through the
stretch. MANY SWEET TREATS vied up front while between horses, gave way in the drive. LUCKY ROAD was finished early while saving ground.

Footnotes
CHEWY CHEWY GOOD dueled up front in the two path through the first turn, shook clear before a half, steadily increased advantage while under steady
handling. FADED MEMORIES lacked early foot while four wide through the first turn, continued back the middle half, advanced while once again four wide
in the second turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, up late for the. CALL DISH dueled up front closest to the rail and inside the winner early,
chased that one up the backstretch, bit closer turning for home, proved no match in the drive, caught late for the place. DIAL DISH fell back to trail after the
start, continued to lag up the backstretch, moved out a bit to split foes leaving the second turn, improved position in the drive. EASY SILENCE came out into
the first turn, continued outside, advanced five wide second turn, got out wider late in that bend, evenly in the drive in lacking a closing response. SOLEMN
OATH in the second flight off the in side, three wide final turn, came up empty for the drive. FREEDOM BOUND off step slow, moved up to mid pack, began
to fade after a half.

Footnotes
TWIRLING MAMBA broke sharply, dueled up front closest to the inside through some glib fractions, shook off the other speed into the lane, enough left to
withstand a late run from the runner up. POLAR WIND off a step slow, trailed for a half, swung out to be five wide turning for home, finished willingly while
too late for the winner, determined for the place. GENERAL TREV forwardly placed toward the inside up the backstretch, continued in traffic through the
turn, lacked clear room entering the stretch, roused when clear, hooked up with the runner up soon after, outkicked for the second spot by that rival, clear of
the others. MAJOR ATTRACTION turned in an even effort while saving ground. HIDDEN PROMISE fell back after the start, continued to lack speed into the
turn, improved position, not a real threat. LULLABY BLING lacked speed, moved outside, four wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive. TAKE
CHARGE NOW chased the dueling leaders early, had little left for the drive. ENERGIZER in mid pack for a half, weakened through the stretch. DREW away
in good order, dueled outside the winner for a half and stopped.

BEE BIT stalked the leader off the inside, engaged that one from the outside midway on the final turn, floated out turning into the lane, dueled past the
furlong marker then kicked clear late under steady handling. LULUMARU broke alertly, got clear early, set the pace toward the inside, came out a bit to float
the winner out turning for home. KALALOU lacked speed off the inside, three wide second turn when moving closer, proved no match for the top two late,
clear of the others. BOSSY BRIDE last to leave, trailed most of the way in making little impact. INDAWIN evenly paced along the inside, continued to save
ground through the final turn, backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
WRAPPER RULE off a step slow, raced back off the pace, swung out four wide turning for home, finished with good courage down the middle of the strip to
win going away. GRAVITRON broke alertly, vied early off the in side, larger lead in the turn, responded when challenged again late in the turn, dueled past
the furlong marker, failed to contain the winner in the late going, proved game for the place. FOREVER HOME within striking distance along the inside,
behind the first first flight while working way out to be three wide into the stretch, along for the show while not a threat to the top two. I'M BOSSY broke
alertly, pressed the runner up early from along the inside, dueled through the turn while remaining closest to the inside, continued to contest the issue past
the furlong marker, weakened late, caught for the show. DIVINE CHOICE lacked early foot, three wide through the turn, improved position while not a
serious threat. PERFECTIONTODETAIL within striking distance off the inside, three wide in the turn when making a bid, vied past the furlong marker then
faltered late. KOWGIRL KIRBY back off the pace, dropped to the inside late in the turn, failed to muster a rally. WINNING MANDATE off a step slow,
remained always back. PLAYFULMISSSAMURAI in mid pack early, steadily faded.

Footnotes
YOUNG BULL in the second flight well out in the strip, came four wide and in some traffic into the lane, moved out a bit to bother a couple of tiring rivals in
upper stretch, set down for the drive, finished well with a late burst to be up in time. IZA DADDY back off the pace and the inside, angled out entering the
stretch, finished with good energy while well out in the strip, too late. HOONANI ROAD in the second flight well wide, five wide late in the turn, bothered
when the winner steered out a bit into the stretch, managed a mild rally after being clear but was outkicked by the top two. WEAST HILL broke alertly,
helped set the pace while between rivals, fell back off the leader in weakening past the furlong marker. BRAVURA CREEK with the pace from the start
inside, continued to vie along the rail turn, shook clear nearing the furlong marker and also weakened the final furlong. FIVE O ONE broke with the leaders,
fell back quickly through traffic, three wide out of the turn, improved position. SIR BRAHMS broke in mid pack, went one paced throughout while four wide
out of the turn. BLANCO BRONCO in the second flight while racing toward the inside, had little for the drive. HEISFANCY off a step slow, trailed well back,
swung five wide out of the turn, picked off some tiring rivals while not a serious threat. PRIVATE LAKE failed to menace outside. R V T THUNDER ROAD
broke back, was fanned six wide into the lane, failed to rally. SOUIXPER CHARGER with the pace while racing three wide, was giving way turning for home
when bothered by the winner, continued to fade.

Footnotes
NOVEL SQUALL back off the pace just off the rail, got through an opening entering the stretch along the inside, briefly clear then held the runner up safe
late under steady handling while drifting out slightly. FOUNDER'S DAY in the second group while also racing toward the inside, steered three wide for the
drive, bit closer a furlong out, clear for the place. DANA'S BEAUTY forwardly placed off the inside, continued to prompt the pace through the turn, came five
wide out of the turn, could not match the the top two in the final furlong, narrowly held the show. MISS TWENTY lacked speed outside, five out to six wide
turning for home, lacked the needed closing kick. FOUETTE narrowly set the pace along the inside, came off the inside to allow the winner the rail turning
for home, faltered the final furlong. EMERALD PRINCESS dueled up front off the inside, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
LONE ROCK prompted the leader for a mile, took over in hand far turn, drew out as he pleased through the stretch while being kept to task. YOU'RE TO
BLAME settled in the second flight toward the inside, steered out to be three wide out of the final turn, finished well to be up for the place, no threat to the
winner. HARPERS FIRST RIDE in the second group while racing off the inside, continued to track the leaders onto the backstretch the second time, moved
closest to the winner out of the third turn, nothing for that one to the wire, kicked down late for the place. CAMPAIGN fell back to trail soon after the start,
continued to lag well back, displayed some modest late interest while never a threat. CARLOS L. got clear to set the pace inside, continued to show the way
through the second turn, offered little resistance to the winner when that one came alongside in the third turn, faltered when headed. CHANGI lacked speed,
fell further and further back the final half mile, jogged in.

Footnotes
RACHIE RACH broke in good order, stalked the early leader off the inside, took over from that one turning for home, drew well clear through the stretch
under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. DENALI ROCKET broke out, tracked the two leaders off the inside, set down for the drive, up late for the place,
no threat to the winner. TAPIT RIGHT broke alertly, sprinted clear toward the inside soon after, offered little resistance to the winner turning for home,
continued to weaken a bit, caught late for the place, remained clear for the show. COUVERTURE in mid pack while off the inside three wide through the
turn, staged a mild late interest to improve position. HADLEYS HERO bothered both sides at the break, well back early as a result, moved out, three out to
four wide turn, improved position with some mild belated interest. WISH FOR CANDY broke in, settled off the pace toward the inside, came up empty for the
drive. SPILLED PERFUME bothered at the start then steadied to be back early, passed tiring rivals while never a threat. CYBER SNEAKER back off the
pace and the inside, four wide through the turn, failed to respond in the drive. NO DIRECT MATCHES in mid pack in the early going, faded. CYBER AFFAIR
was never involved. MORO MAGIC in the second flight for a half, stopped through the stretch.
