Footnotes
LEWIS CAL got bumped in a chain reaction soon after the start, prompted the pace outside ROYAL WAR, took over entering the final furlong and drove
clear. DOUBLE BLESSING got bumped between horses and steadied after the start, raced in the second flight to the far turn, came four wide into the lane
and rallied outside rivals to get up for second. ROYAL WAR broke outward, set the pace inside, and weakened through the late stages. CAMPEADOR
bumped with DRUM AND DRUMMER at the break, then veered out bumping FIVEFINGERDISCOUNT into rivals and had the rider briefly lose the right iron,
alternated between the rail and two-path on the turns, and finished evenly. DRUM AND DRUMMER bumped with CAMPEADOR at the start, saved ground
and lacked the needed response. SETTE STELLE was no factor inside. ADMIRAL TRUFFLES broke a step slow, steadied on the first turn, and was never
in contention. FIVEFINGERDISCOUNT got bumped between horses and steadied soon after the start, checked on the first turn, and was no factor two wide.
NOT SO EASY broke slowly, raced four wide early, and faded in the stretch. SANDY DUDE got bumped between horses and steadied after the start, and
was through after a half-mile. IAN DUNROSS was forced out by ROYAL WAR at the start, and trailed. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE
RIDER OF DOUBLE BLESSING FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START WAS DISMISSED. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
RESIDENT angled in to the set the pace along the rail, had his heels clipped nearing the seven-eighths pole, drew clear nearing the far turn and widened
under left-handed urging in the lane. SWING WEST stalked the winner in the clear two wide and was clearly second best. DARK AGES was bumped early,
saved ground in range, couldn't keep pace around the turn and stayed on for the show. STARSHIP ARAMIS broke inwardly and bumped
ROBINTAKINCHARGE into the inside runners, clipped the winner's heels nearing the seven-eighths pole, angled four wide soon after and never
threatened. JANUARY WON settled off the pace outside, made some progress three and four wide around the turn and faded in the lane.
ROBINTAKINCHARGE was bumped between foes at the start, raced in range three wide and came up empty in the lane. MONMOUTH DR was very rank
at the start, was bumped between foes multiple times down the chute and played no further factor. TAKEDOWN was bumped several times in the chute,
steadied into the far turn and retreated. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE pursued SMOKE ALARM from outside around the turn, challenged for command through the furlong grounds and edged away
under a drive. ROMARIO broke a step slow, advanced four wide leaving the turn, and was up for the place despite attempting to lug in. AMOR LEJANO
(ARG) slipped through on the rail to join the leaders in upper stretch, but could not sustain the bid. SMOKE ALARM set the pace in the two-path, and
weakened between horses in deep stretch. HONEY WON'T broke a step slowly, and was outrun.

MY MANE MAN set the pace two wide, drew clear around the turn, was headed nearing the eighth pole, fought back inside of that foe and drove clear late.
MADDY'S DREAM broke in a tangle to race far back early, made strong progress inside down the backstretch, advanced three wide around the turn, put a
head in front of the winner nearing the eighth pole but was outfinished from there. ALONZO broke inwardly, raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide
near the quarter pole and was along for the show. SCRAPPY ARTIE was in tight at the start, made some progress four wide around the turn and weakened
in the lane. HONESTO steadily faded three wide. TWICE TOO MANY had his head turned at the start to be away quite slowly, made some progress five
wide around the turn and came up empty in the lane. FINANCIN OUR DREAM was outrun while saving ground and swinging five wide near the quarter
pole. NUREYEV'S DREAM led early, chased the winner inside and retreated after a half.

GRAINGER COUNTY vied outside POSITIVELY AWESOME early, cleared off around the turn, and was kept busy to remain well in command. KING OF
ROCK broke slowly and was outsprinted early, saved ground into the stretch and rallied on the fence to get up for second. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR raced
three to four wide around the turn, and lacked a solid closing bid. GOING FOR GOLD was on hold early inside, shifted out four wide through the turn, and
improved position without threatening. COOL HAND COOP chased two to three wide for three furlongs, and weakened in the lane. FRANCO'S TEAM broke
two to three lengths behind the field, and was never prominent. POSITIVELY AWESOME dueled inside the winner to the turn, and faded steadily. ZORB
was two to three wide on the turn, and empty into the stretch.

Footnotes
LIVIN AT THE BEACH worked her way into ideal early position tracking the leaders in the clear, waited briefly inside on the far turn, got through in the
two-path between horses turning for home, bumped with MAP EM UP while taking over from that one in midstretch, and moved clear under a very mild
drive. COURTED advanced three wide after six furlongs, finished willingly but was no real threat to the winner. SHE FLED THE SCENE lodged a mild bid
four wide coming off the far turn, then flattened out through the last eighth of a mile. MAP EM UP broke out into EIGHTY SEVEN NORTH, set a sharp pace
hounded by COFFEE BUZZ BUZZ, and bumped with LIVIN AT THE BEACH while weakening a furlong out. PRETTY RACHEL raced four then five wide
approaching the stretch, briefly loomed a threat outside but was outfinished. ALOHA KITTEN raced in the second flight three wide early, and never
menaced. SMIRKOTCH bumped with EIGHTY SEVEN NORTH at the start, and was never close. MY MISS MIRACLE was outrun early inside, moved out
four wide on the far turn and could not gain. EIGHTY SEVEN NORTH bobbled at the break and was bumped into SMIRKOTCH by EIGHTY SEVEN
NORTH, and lagged far back. COFFEE BUZZ BUZZ tugged her way forward pressing MAP EM UP from outside, and was done after six furlongs. SPIN
YOUR PARTNER threw her head and lunged out of the gate two lengths behind the next-to-last horse, and was outrun. LEYENDA was four wide early, and
always far back. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
TAITA lacked early speed, advanced two wide around the turn, split rivals three wide in upper stretch, seized command nearing the sixteenth pole and
powered clear. ROAD TO SUCCESS was in range inside, angled out near the quarter pole to bid between rivals, drifted out in upper stretch, drifted back in
leaving the eighth pole, brushed with MR. BRIGGS and held off that foe for the place. MR. BRIGGS set the pace in the two path, angled in nearing the lane,
led past the eighth pole, was brushed late and was outfinished for the place. BILLY YANK stalked the pace in the three path and weakened in the lane.
EMPEROR'S CAUSE went evenly inside. SWING LOW broke through the starting gate prior to the start but was never out of the grasp of the assistant
starter, raced three and four wide and never threatened. GLOBAL EMPIRE was outrun outside. BEN COPENHAGEN was in range four wide and retreated
through the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
PROJECTED (GB) was briefly in tight early, settled into easy striking range inside as things opened up on the first turn, maneuvered out three wide at the
head of the stretch, responded well and edged away under pressure. PHILO banged into the right side of the gate and was last away, raced four to five wide
throughout, and finished gamely. NOTSOSUBTLE was a step slow at the start, went three then four wide on the far turn, and gained late on the far outside.
MYSTICAL MOON raced in midpack to the stretch near the two-path, encountered traffic through the furlong grounds and improved willingly.
YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY bumped with CASH CALL KITTEN at the start, tracked the leaders three wide to the stretch, and needed more late.
LAUDERDALE set the pace inside, and faltered through the final furlong. CASH CALL KITTEN bumped with YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY at the start, raced
in the second flight three wide to the far turn, came five wide into the lane and made no headway. TRAFFIC PATTERN prompted the pace outside
LAUDERDALE, bid between horses turning for home, but gave way through the late stages. UHTRED raced two to three wide on the turns, and tired. ALL
GOOD gained mildly into upper stretch, but could not sustain the bid. DOCTOR D J trailed throughout. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

raced off the pace two wide and finished willingly to gain the place. RUNNING FOR RIZ pressed the pace two wide, briefly led near the quarter pole,
succumbed in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the lane and saved the show. UNCORK THE BOTTLE bumped with LUDINGTON at the

ADVANCED STRATEGY settled in striking range two wide to the far turn, shifted to the four-path for clear sailing into the stretch, rallied steadily outside
rivals and took a late duel from MYSTIC LANCELOT to get the decision. MYSTIC LANCELOT saved ground just off the early leaders, moved to the
two-path after six furlongs, went back inside with a rail bid to take over from EVERYONELOVESJAMED in midstretch, and was edged out late. OCEANS
MAP broke slowest , began to advance around the far turn inside, lacked room and steadied in traffic a sixteenth out, and was up for the show.
EVERYONELOVESJAMES set a sharp pace to upper stretch, and was overrun from both sides into the final furlong. CAIRO CAMPAIGN raced three to four
wide, and lacked a closing response. LIGHT FURY saved ground to the stretch, and steadied in heavy traffic through the late stages. DUNDALK pressed
the pace outside to the stretch, and faded. KAUFY BEAN was four wide early, stayed in range three wide after six furlongs, but faded in the stretch. KING
SLEW (ARG) was a step slow to begin, raced three to four wide to midway on the far turn, then moved in while empty into the lane. RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
GREEN GAL pressed the pace two wide, took the lead nearing the far turn, angled in to set the pace along the rail round that bend and drew off under a
drive in the lane. STARSHIP MISHKA was soundly bumped just after the start, was shut off soon after, saved ground well back early, circled five wide
around the far turn and finished willingly to gain the place. HARDLY SOCIAL stalked the pace inside, briefly went two wide to pass a foe midway around the
far turn, stayed on through the lane but was outfinished for the place. METAFORA checked early, was rank inside around the first turn, went four wide
around the far turn and had a mild stretch gain outside. NOBLE NAME was off a bit slowly, raced in range two wide and lacked a rally.
DONTMESSWITHTESS was forced in early, repeatedly checked through the opening furlong, raced three and four wide around the first turn, advanced
three wide between rivals around the far turn, bid near the quarter pole but weakened through the final furlong. RAISON THE GLASS was bumped and shut
off just after the start, saved ground and never threatened. TIME SENSITIVE steadied early, raced off the pace two wide, made a four wide move into
contention around the far turn, was in a bit tight in upper stretch and faded. LADY TAPATIA came in at the start and pushed DONTMESSWITHTESS in,
sped off to set the pace along the rail, was collared late on the backstretch, checked entering the far turn and again midway around the bend and had no
further bids. SECRETS KEPT tracked the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn and tired in the drive.
