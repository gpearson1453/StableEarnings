Footnotes
WHERETHEMONEYWENT settled off the early pace while off the inside, moved through the three path on the turn when pressing the pace, continued in
close proximity into the lane, engaged the leader when straightening then drew clear and widened to the wire. BOLD FIGURE chased the pace from the two
path into the turn, moved to the lead in mid-turn, engaged with the winner into the lane then was no match through the final eighth and kept on to save the
place. DOUBLE DAWN was in the two path through the turn, continued to chase the top two through the lane while moving off the inside, finished evenly
while gaining on the place spot. DROP O' CHOCOLATE was never a threat while in the four path through the turn. LADY PREACH was along the inside
through the turn, came off the rail entering the lane and tired. ABSOLUTE ANGEL hustled to the lead before the first call, continued on the diminishing led
until mid-turn then faded.

Footnotes
ROCK N JUNE BUG set the pace at once while saving ground, continued on a clear lead into the lane and was kept to the task to the end to maintain the
advantage. COMPASS POINT chased the winner through the turn while in the three path, continued with good aim on the the leader inside the eighth pole
and continued to remain close up under left-handed urging to the end. GALILEO'S ROCK was in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane
from the four path and finished evenly. SENT FOR HIS GLORY chased the winner into the turn while in the two path, continued in the two path into the lane
with aim on the leader then weakened. FOREVER A CHAMP raced in the two path through the turn when in mid-pack and lacked a closing response
through the lane. ALTERNATE NIGHTS was never a factor while near the inside into the lane. FLEETSTER was last away, raced in the two path into the
turn, was asked for more in mid-turn and lacked a response.
