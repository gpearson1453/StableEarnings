Footnotes
STONE SECRET off the pace while racing outside, five wide into the turn, ranged up four wide to challenge late in the turn, shook clear nearing the furlong
ground, enough left under a firm right handed crop to last. CONFESS behind the first flight, prompted that group into and through the turn, lacked room
exiting the bend, dropped to an open rail in upper stretch, finished willingly up the rail to be getting to the winner. ACE GILFORD broke alertly, vied up front
in the run up the backstretch, continued to contest the issue through the turn, weakened a bit when unable to match strides with the top two, saved the show
late. TOIL AND TROUBLE last away, raced back and three wide early, swung out five wide into the lane, improved position to be gaining for the show.
HANEY BOYS in the second flight while racing four wide, came five wide into the lane, went evenly through the stretch. SQUARED STRAIGHT with the
pace closest to the inside, vied through the turn, was tiring when bothered midstretch, continued to weaken. SCYNTZ set or forced the pace while widest of
the first group, gave way entering the stretch, drifted in midstretch and continued to weaken. THAT DUDE remained back while racing just off the inside.

Footnotes
CHICORY BLUE in the second flight off the inside, in some traffic midway up the backstretch and into the far turn, advanced three wide when challenging in
upper stretch, drifted out a bit when taking control inside the furlong marker, enough left to hold off the runner up late. GRAY HOPE in the second flight
while inside, continued to save ground into and through most of the final turn, steered out three wide for room turning into the stretch, floated out by the
winner the final sixteenth, not enough late to miss. KID'S MISCHIEF broke well, dueled up front while racing off the inside, disposed of the other speed to be
clear late in the final turn, offered brief resistance to the top two with less than a furlong remaining, faltered the final sixteenth. SKYCRAFT off step slow,
trailed much of the way just off the inside, steered three wide when advancing out of the final turn, showed some late interest to improve position. LUCKY
BE A LADY broke on top, dueled up front inside, weakened late in the final turn, finished up evenly. WITCH DOCTOR in the second flight while racing four
wide, continued on the outside, three wide through the second bend, tired in the drive. POP LIFE off the early pace, steered four wide out of the final bend,
made little impact through the stretch. FULL OF RUN off a step slow, lacked speed, floated out five wide exiting the in the final turn, failed to muster a rally
through the stretch.

Footnotes
SHES GOT IT within striking distance in the run up the backstretch, advanced through the turn, challenged between rivals late in the turn, put a head in front
entering the stretch, edged steadily clear the final furlong while being kept to task. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED broke sharp, narrowly set the pace inside,
continued to set or forced the issue closest to the inside the lane, gave ground grudgingly to the winner in the late going, gained the nod for the place.
CRESCENDO BLING away in good order, contested the pace while racing three wide and outside, equal terms with the winner into the stretch, weakened a
bit the final furlong while proving no match for that one, missed the nod for the place. WICKED CHOCOLATE evenly paced along the inside, lacked a
serious closing response. B REWARDING off the pace and the inside, three wide through the turn, improved only slightly through the stretch. I PICK
PHOEBE with the pace off the inside early, fell back in the turn, continued to weaken through the stretch. PLAYFULMISSSAMURAI mid pack pack early
toward the inside, had nothing for the drive. CARRILLO STREET last away, four wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. SUPER STEAMY broke back, was
never close, gave way completely in the drive, distanced, jogged in.

Footnotes
ABRAMAX bobbled at the start, forwardly placed while racing outside, came three wide when moving to challenge turning for home, narrowly showed the
way past the furlong marker, larger lead late, narrowly held the runner up at bay late in a determined effort. BEAUTY DAY back off the pace, in the two path
when off the pace through the turn, dropped to the rail for the drive, lodged an inside bid late, denied. JOY IN THE JOURNEY broke alertly, allowed the
leader to clear early early, vied through the turn between rivals, weakened in the drive, narrowly saved the show. TIGER BAIT back off the pace and the
inside, came four wide out of the turn, roused, not enough for the show on the outside late. LUCKY EVERY DAY away well, cleared to the inside before a
quarter, narrowly showed the way through the bend, faltered in the drive. FRENCH CHARM last away, trailed early off the inside, three wide late turn,
improved slightly while making little impact through the lane. LIL TATER in mid pack early inside, weakened. RED LINGERIE was finished early, far back.

Footnotes
NISI PRIUS forwardly placed from the start, advanced on the leader three wide late in the turn, took over past he furlong marker, kicked well clear under
intermittent pressure. CANDY RUNNER away well clear, sprinted well clear soon after, daylight early turn, dueled into the lane with the winner, proved no
match for the winner, held sway for the place. BOBBIN TAIL back off the pace and the inside, moved closer in traffic late in the turn, waited briefly then
shifted out three wide entering the stretch, rallied outside and finished willingly while lugging in to be rapidly getting to the runner up late. BLAME THE RED
CAT chased the leader off the inside, moved slightly closer late in the turn, went flat in the drive to finish up evenly. MAKING PROGRESS settled off the
pace, saved ground turn, also went one paced through the lane. I'M BOSSY behind the leaders, four down to three wide turn, lacked closing kick.
SHE'SSKYSTHELIMIT remained always back. LIGHT SHIFT in the second flight outside, four wide through much of the turn, tired in the drive. STORMY
MATTIE off a step slow, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ROCKTHEPULPIT behind the pace inside, continued to save ground through the turn, rallied up the inside, narrowly gained the advantage late and proved
best in a determined effort. AFRICAN WARRIOR off the early and the inside, three wide into the lane, challenged on the outside soon after, put a head in
front to lead past the furlong marker, outkicked in the late gain. SMELLIN CANDY lacked early foot, four wide into the stretch, challenged outside the top two
late, not enough the final strides. PAY DIRT broke on top, cleared early, showed the way through the turn, faltered in the final furlong from between horses.
GOOSE ALMIGHTY pushed out start, lacked speed, saved ground through the turn, improved slightly in the drive, no real threat. FIRE TWO POINT O
within striking distance off the inside, came up empty for the drive. THORNISH void of speed, trailed early, passed tiring rivals while not a serious contest.
IT'S BELLAMY TIME broke out, bothered settled off the early pace, finished before a half. DEMIGOD chased the early leader off the inside, gave way in the
drive. RUSTY CAGE in tight, bothered at the start, was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
SIANARA forwardly placed off the inside, prompted the issue in the two path through the turn, ranged up three wide to challenge into the lane, extended
drive to the wire, proved narrowly best late under frim handling. MINER'S QUEEN with the pace from along the inside, dueled through the turn, held a
narrow advantage past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner. BERRY GOOD back off the pace and the inside, moved closer in traffic
past the furlong marker, steered out, finished well clear of the others. NORTHERN DIAMOND moved up to contest the issue up the backstretch, continued
to duel through the turn outside the runner up, weakened the final furlong. SATIN ROSE off a step slow, remained always back while fanned 5w into lane,
no real kick. MUSIC APP forwardly placed while three wide, began a steady fade late in the turn. MORE ROMANCE off a step slow, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
KABOOM BABY off a step slow, back off the pace toward the inside, angled out sharply to bump PROUD VICTORIA into the stretch, set down, closed
resolutely to prove narrowly best while remaining far out in the strip. BYE BYE J within striking distance off the inside, steered out four wide for room into the
lane, challenged late while inside the winner, briefly led, outkicked late to miss. TOO PRETTY prompted the pace from along the inside, continued to save
ground turn, lacked a winning response to prove no match for the top two late, held the show. HILLARY G closest to the leader, crept closer late in the turn,
also lacked a knockout punch to be outfinished for the show spot. HISSY MISSY off the rail and the pace, three wide and in some traffic late in the turn,
went evenly through the stretch. MATAPAN in mid pack while toward the inside, continued one paced throughout in lacking a response in the drive.
WILLOW MOON sprinted clear soon after an alert break, set the pace in the two path, gave way from between rivals just inside the furlong marker. PROUD
VICTORIA off the pace well out in the strip, bumped, forced wide by the winner turning into the lane, came up empty for the drive. SATTERSFIELD broke
back, three wide when trailing through the turn, not a threat in the drive. OOCHIE in tight, bobbled start, remained always back in the three path. PRINCESS
LILLI BUG broke alertly, shortened stride abruptly into the turn, gradually pulled up through the bend, vanned off.

Footnotes
TAILORBESWIFT prominent from the start, off the inside, dueled through the turn in the two path, salted away the other speed into the lane, drew steadily
clear under intermittent pressure. FAST SOPHIA in the second group while off the inside, moved out to be three wide into the lane, set down for the drive,
extended drive for the place spot, up late for that position while not a threat to the winner. JANET'S ROCKET broke alertly, showed the way up the
backstretch, dueled through the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, nipped late for the place. WARM BEAUTY lacked speed while toward the
inside, saved ground through the turn, improved position a bit in the drive without proving a serious threat. DENA'S BOLD MOVE fell back to trail after the
start, bothered slightly inside of a stricken rival three furlongs out, found best stride late to improve position. FIVE RIVERS settled in mid pack toward the
inside, two path turn, went in even fashion through the lane in lacking a closing response. GOLD N SEXY forwardly placed along the inside, weakened.
LINE OF FAITH failed to menace while racing off the inside. LADY PRIEST tired while racing three wide. AUNT SUNSHINE in tight at the start, was racing
back when he appeared to take a bad step into the turn, shortened stride, pulled up, vanned off.
