Footnotes
TEA OLIVE was away alertly from the gate and set the pace from the outset, opened up a clear advantage nearing the lane, was off the rail into the lane,
remained clear near the eighth pole and held safely in the final stages. ANOTHERWORLDINSIDE was bumped and bothered at the start, chased the pace
early, raced in the three path along the turn, stayed in the three path entering the lane, made a bid in the stretch and was gaining in the late stages. GUNITE
raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane with a belated gain in the final stages. TWENTY FOUR MAMBA chased the
pace early on, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the five path entering the lane and flattened out in the stretch run. LT. FINN tracked the pace
early on, was off the rail into the lane and faded in the stretch drive. ELI steadied into the turn from the rail, was off the rail into the lane and moved up in the
stretch run. THELONIOUS was a bit slow at the break, was in the six path into the lane with no bid down the lane. BIG REDWHITEBLUE checked hard into
the turn along the rail, was in the five path into the lane and was lugging in down the stretch. VIDAL broke very awkwardly from the gate, was rushed up and
eventually spent.

Footnotes
KEEP YOUR DISTANCE set the pace along the inside while feeling mild pressure from GIANNA'S GIFT, drew off when let out in upper stretch, and was
ridden out under steady hand urging through the final furlong. GIANNA'S GIFT stalked two wide, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, and
gamely fended off CENTERFOLD ANGEL through the final furlong for place. CENTERFOLD ANGEL tracked from off of the pace two wide while in the three
path around the turn, shifted four wide turning for home to commence a rally, but only produced a mild kick, ranged up outside of GIANNA's GIFT to bid for
place passing the furlong pole, but was denied that position by that rival. RADIANTRITHYM chased along the inside, but tired through the lane. SOLAR
KITTEN lied off of the pace along the inside while a path off of the inner railing around the turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, but failed to factor.
MY WYNTER ROSE was outrun. LIL MISS HOT MESS stalked three wide, but weakened in upper stretch.

BORRACHO set the pace along the inside while LUCK OF THE DRAW pressed from off his outer flank, shook off that foe entering the lane and drew clear,
then held sway through the final furlong under driving pressure. LEADER OF MEN stalked along the inside, saved ground around the far turn, then gained
along the rail to catch LUCK OF THE DRAW for place a sixteenth out, but failed to threaten the winner. LUCK OF THE DRAW pressed the leader from the
outside, but came under a drive at the three furlong pole to keep pace with his inner counterpart, but failed to do so entering the lane, and tired thereafter.
CHASIN CHARLIE was outrun. FUTILE lied off of the pace two wide, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
SET PIECE (GB) rated well off of the pace along the inside while staying a bit off of the inner railing around both turns, patiently awaited racing room
entering the lane before swinging four wide for clear sailing at the three sixteenths pole, rallied to bid for the lead outside of a pair of rivals a sixteenth out,
and cleared before being wrapped up at the wire. SNAPPER SINCLAIR tracked from midpack in the two path, decisively advanced to a three wide stalking
position approaching the half mile pole, sustained that spot around the far turn, chased GRAY'S FABLE through upper stretch as that foe kicked clear,
grinded away at that foes margin in midstretch as SET PIECE (GB) rallied along side, bid for the lead simultaneously with that foe a sixteenth from home,
but was outkicked, before achieving place at the wire. GRAY'S FABLE set the pace inside of SAYYAF early on, tugged keenly around the first turn to
maintain an advantage, settled approaching the half mile pole, inched clear of that rival entering the lane, held that clear margin through midstretch, but met
a pair of bids inside the final furlong, was surpassed a sixteenth out, then got nailed on the wire for place. SUGOI stalked along the inside, but chased
evenly through the lane, and failed to produce a bid. LOGICAL MYTH lied off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path around the far turn while
attempting to find racing room inside of SPECTACULAR GEM, did so by shifted four wide turning for home, but lacked the needed kick, and failed to factor.
CAPTIVATING MOON trailed around both turns, and passed tired foes without menacing. SAYYAAF prompted the pace setter from the outside while pulling
keenly around the first turn, sustained pressing position around the far turn, but gave way between horses in upper stretch. SPECTACULAR GEM lied off of
the pace two wide, advanced outside of foes to a four wide tracking position down the backstretch, but tired while being floated five wide entering the lane,
and weakened thereafter.

Footnotes
SKINNY DIP prompted the pace three wide, inched closer to bid entering the lane, dueled outside of BREAK CURFEW through upper stretch, but bested
that foe approaching the furlong pole, and drew off under driving pressure thereafter. BREAK CURFEW set the pace along the inside, clung to an
advantage entering the lane from a pair of outer bidding rivals, dueled inside of SKINNY DIP through upper stretch, but failed to match strides approaching
the furlong marker, and safely held place. PRIMACY broke inwards and was last away, trailed the field along the inside into the turn, commenced a mild rally
after switching out two wide at the five sixteenths pole, but only managed to chase the leaders home. LISTEN UP vied for the lead two wide and from
between horses, but weakened in upper stretch. BOURBINA stalked along the inside, but was outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch, and failed to
produce a bid before tiring. TAPPIN INTO SUMMER tracked four wide around the turn, but was done early.

Footnotes
INTO MYSTIC stalked along the inside, slipped through a large rail opening entering the lane to inherit a lead under her own power, drew clear in upper
stretch, and held sway from CHANGE OF CONTROL through the final furlong under driving pressure. CHANGE OF CONTROL stalked two wide while in
the three path around the turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, quickened approaching the furlong pole with a clear INTO MYSTIC to catch, then chased
that foe home well through the final furlong, but proved second best. WINNING ENVELOPE was pinched back soon after the start, lied well off of the pace
in the three path around the turn, swung six wide turning for home, and stayed on for a minor share while hanging on her left lead. SHE'SONTHEWARPATH
saved ground far off of the pace, and improved inside of foes through midstretch. OLEKSANDRA (AUS) was off a step slowly and trailed the field along the
inside into the turn, swung seven wide turning for home to set up shop outside of rivals, but only produced a mild kick, and improved past tiring foes in the
final furlong. YES IT'S GINGER prompted the pace setter from the outside, got kept in the three path around the turn by that foe, then tired between horses
in upper stretch. FOXXY BELLE tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted to the two path entering the lane, but failed to menace and faded. LADY
GRACE tracked from midpack two wide, but was outmoved by outer foes turning for home, shifted five wide in midstretch, and failed to make an impact.
ELLE Z set the pace inside of YES IT'S GINGER, stayed a path off of the inner railing around the turn, but allowed for ample racing room along the rail
entering the lane for the eventual winner, got headed by that foe at the quarter pole, and yielded in upper stretch before further weakening through the final
furlong. A BIT OF BOTH broke awkwardly, lied off of the pace three wide while in the four path around the turn, shifted to the five path turning for home, but
failed to mount a rally.

Footnotes
LEMON AND DIEM tracked three wide, inched closer four wide turning for home to bid in upper stretch, drove past the leader approaching the furlong pole,
and drove clear. NO OBLIGATION stalked along the inside, but was slightly shuffled back behind the tiring leader turning for home allowing him to be
outmoved by an outer foe, shifted two wide entering the lane and produced a bid inside of the leading pair passing the furlong pole, but was outkicked by an
outer rival, then held place. BOLD ADVENTURE prompted the pace two wide, took over at the three furlong pole, showed the way from the three path
around the turn, but proved no match for an outer bidding rival approaching the furlong pole, and tired. SOUTHERN WILL took solid bumps from rivals on
both sides at the start, lied off of the pace along the inside shifted four wide into the turn, then five wide into the lane, and stayed on while hanging on his left
lead. STUD PUPPY bumped an outer foe at the start, trailed around the turn, and improved without threatening. EAGLE CAP bumped an inner rival at the
start, lied far off of the pace two wide, and was outrun. DESOTO'S WAR set the pace inside of BOLD AVENTURE, but was headed by that foe approaching
the three furlong pole, faded turning for home, and was eased through the lane.
