Footnotes
LUCKENBACH pressed the pace of ATTA BOY BILLY while racing three-wide, angled out further into the stretch, reached the fore inside the furlong marker
and drew off with little need of urging. ATTA BOY BILLY set a pressured pace while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-eighths pole
and yielded to the winner through the final furlong. CIEN POR CIEN pressed the pace while racing four-wide throughout and finished with some late interest.
UNCONSCIOUS POWER showed brief speed, weakened and was eased through the lane. STREET BULL was off slow, lagged throughout and was eased
through the lane.

Footnotes
WINE AT NINE was reserved just off the leaders early, advanced five-wide through the second turn, responded to steady urging and wore down BIG
BARREL in the closing yards. BIG BARREL stalked the pace of AVALON KING while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter,
opened a clear margin but could not resist the winner late. ALL UNDER CONTROL raced unhurried early from off the rail, reached a contending position
into the stretch but failed to gain late. THETRAILERGUY lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not menace. OLYMPIC
EXPRESS was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. AVALON KING sprinted clear before going a quarter,
raced three-wide while setting the pace, weakened after going six furlongs and was eased through the lane.

ANGEL CREEK pulled clear after going a quarter, raced five-wide while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. BRING IT settled
off the leaders early, moved eighth-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished with good energy. ALLERGIC TO LOGIC
lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. NEW YEAR'S CHIC pressed the pace from the inside for a
half and gave way. ITAINTEASYBEINGRAY lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and failed to menace. BODE'S BEST
was away in good order to press the pace while racing three-wide and gradually weakened. TOSSAPENNYDOWN showed brief speed from the inside and
weakened.

Footnotes
RED NOVA stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up in tandem with HOLY MUCHACHO to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with that rival
and drew off through the closing yards. HOLY MUCHACHO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up with the winner to offer a bid nearing the
quarter, vied with that foe, could not match strides late but finished well to hold the place. LOOSE BALL lagged early, raced five-wide through the second
turn and finished with good late energy. TEQUILA BLANCO raced five-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the second
turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. RIDE FOR GLORY raced off the leaders from between foes, moved four-wide through the second
turn, offered a bid into the stretch and failed to sustain his rally. IRISH CHARLIE raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved
seven-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed bid. CAPTAIN RED raced off the pacesetters from between foes, moved six-wide through the
second turn and was not a factor. AUTISM SAVANT was away in good order to open a clear lead before going a quarter, raced four-wide while setting the
pace and weakened after going five furlongs.

Footnotes
GENTLE PRINCE raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the tureen, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and held off the closing ALBANY
FRONT to prevail. ALBANY FRONT settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good
late energy. CATS TOUCH was off a step slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the tureen, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a late
bid. DUDLEY STUDLEY sprinted clear at once, raced four-wide while setting the pace and gave way through the final sixteenth. DIZZY DANCER lacked
early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and found his best stride late. SUCCESS RATE raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn
and finished evenly late. UNION BROTHER raced off the leaders throughout and lacked the needed rally. BUCKLEY BAY chased the leaders while racing
four-wide, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. GEORGIAN ROAD chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after
going a half.

ROCK pressed the pace of the winner while racing five-wide and failed to gain on that rival in the drive. DIIACHI settled off the leaders early, moved
seven-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. ME was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing
response. OUT FOR JUSTICE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. PLANET NINE lacked early foot,
raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BUBBA BAY lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. DON'S FINAL
FINAL raced just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. THE KOHEN showed no early speed, raced eighth-wide through

with a late rally. POLAR ROUTE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly.

Footnotes
PARLEY STREET settled off the leaders early, advanced six-wide through the turn, responded to steady urging and wore down A NEW TREND to be going
away late. A NEW TREND dueled for the lead while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run but could not match strides with the winner
late. MR VIEW pressed the pace from the inside and gave way in the drive. PASSED BY PAUL disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way
after going a half. KONA SKYE settled off the leaders from the inside and lacked the needed closing response. GIMME SPACE lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and was not a factor. KODIAK KING lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not
menace. DUKATI raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. COLONEL GOTHAM showed brief speed
and weakened. REIGN ON (GB) lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TOP ROCKET was void of early foot, raced
three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
