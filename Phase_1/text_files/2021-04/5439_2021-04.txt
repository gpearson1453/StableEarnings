Footnotes
DR CHAPPELL kept close early racing outside engaging abreast foe on the far turn dueling to upper stretch edging away late in the three path. JULIE'S
FERRARI sent clear was pressed on a narrow lead down the backside then through the far turn into upper stretch ceding late in the two path. OAK ROOM
prompted the pace chasing on the far turn, lost ground into upper stretch weakening in the eight path moving back to contention on a tiring front end late.
MAN DOWN slow early was never in the hunt passing tired ones to improve. PERFECT BLEND tracked the early pace then faded on the far turn.
PHARAOH'S KITTEN was never involved. BEEBE'S BEST BET hustled early would give way abruptly on the far turn.
