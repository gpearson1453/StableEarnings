Footnotes
DROWNINGNDIAMONDS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly
drew off. SPECTACTICAL disputed the pace from the inside, angled out into the stretch, re-bid and finished with good courage. STARWARD vied for the
early advantage while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and gave way through the final furlong. EUROBADGUY
showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with some late run. FETCHUM KETCHUM
broke sharply to duel for the lead from between foes for the opening quarter and weakened. PLAY AT THE PLATE was off a step slow and lagged far back
throughout.

Footnotes
FLY TO THE BANK was away in good order to press the pace of SHIPMAN'S SONG while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin into the stretch and drew off with complete authority. SHIPMAN'S SONG broke sharply to set a pressured pace
while racing three-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. CRIMINAL raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the
turn, reached a contending position into the lane and finished evenly late. KIPPER lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out nearing
the quarter and was not a factor. VALENTINE GUY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive.

yards. BLING SPRINGSTEEN was void of early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, gained command nearing the five-sixteenths marker, opened a clear
lead into the stretch but could not resist the winner late. LITTLE VALLEY GIRL was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and finished with a steady bid. SALACIOUSACUSATION was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and finished with a
belated bid. SKIPPERLITTTLEGIRL lagged early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and found her best stride late. BROOKLYN

Footnotes
DEJA CREW sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. JUSTINS OMEN raced unhurried early, moved
five-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished with a steady bid. EL CHIHUAS chased the leaders while racing four-wide
throughout and failed to gain in the drive. SPIKED CIDER chased the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way.
FROGGY was off slow, raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. POPPY'S OATS lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. OKLAHOMA LINE tracked the leaders from the inside for a half and weakened. KAY'S GRAY was void of
early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. LETSPLAYAGAME showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the turn and
weakened.
