Footnotes
VOY A TI vied through the opening quarter, quickly drew away and maintained a big advantage under moderate urging. FIELD OFFICER lagged far behind,
advanced wide on the turn, angled back in stretch getting up for place late. DEL PO stumbled at the start, led early and continued willingly. GO HUSKIES
saved ground off the pace then proved empty in the stretch. JUNGLIST prompted the pace briefly then stopped abruptly on the turn. SUNSHINE TOMMY
broke sluggishly and was always outrun. WISEMAN'S SECRET began fading into the far turn trailing his field.

GREENBACK dueled outside, took over nearing the quarter pole and edged away while kept to his task. CALL FITZROY allowed to settle far back, rallied
on the final turn, angled out in the stretch with a mild bid. UNCLE NED well placed behind the dueling leaders but flattened out in the stretch. COURT SKY
dwelt at the start, raced far behind then showed some late energy. SPIRIT WOLF vied along the inside for three quarters and proved empty in the stretch.
FLORIDA ENDEAVOUR saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally. I SAY I PLAY chased within range for a quarter mile then stopped losing contact with
his field.

Footnotes
YES I'M LOOKING stalked the pace three wide, bid into the stretch and finished determinedly to get up in time. MIRACULOUSBLESSING pursued the
loose pacesetter, led into the stretch, drew clear briefly but was caught near the wire. MAGICALLYDELICIOUS saved ground close up and continued
gamely to the finish. SHIRLEYTHESHOPPER chased off the pace, split rivals on the turn then moved wide with her stretch rally. MISS PHILLY DILLY
lacked speed inside and made a gradual late gain. BAHAMA BREEZE broke very slowly, rushed to the front inside and stopped in the stretch. OUI
MADAME lagged far behind throughout. DIAL A LADY dropped out of contention early and gave way readily.
