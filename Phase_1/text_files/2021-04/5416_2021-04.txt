turn, weakened in upper stretch fading near mid track. BEING THERE was never involved. WE WILL SHINE set the early pace then faded along the inside

SHE'S APPLES pressed the pace through the turn shaking clear along the inside in upper stretch widening under a drive. QT BLIEGH went evenly through
the turn coming five wide in upper stretch rallying late to clear for place. WILD OATSSE brushed at the break would lag through the turn coming six wide in
upper stretch gaining late position. PRECARIOUS HOUR chased the pace to upper stretch wearing down there. NATIVE VALLEY a step slow early played
no factor. GREAT JAZZ pressured the pace through the turn then wilted in upper stretch. TOURIST ATTRACTION was never involved. MONEY ON RED
brushed at the break would fold up on the turn.
