Footnotes
KAVOD was asked leaving the gate, settled under some urging on the inside, moved off the rail under a strong hand ride around the five-sixteenths then
shifted three wide, was driven four wide into the stretch under the crop, gained to make a bid near the three-sixteenths, took the lead into the final furlong,
fought with the runner-up into the final sixteenth then moved clear under strong urging. POPPY FLOWER settled at the rear of the field, pulled under
restraint while behind horses in the two to three path early on the turn, continued in hand until the five-sixteenths then shifted five wide, was asked six wide
into the stretch, gained to make an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, fought with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get
the place. ACTION POTENTIAL was restless in the gate, came away in good order, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the
turn, was roused while on even terms for the lead coming to the quarter-pole then turned into the stretch under the crop, battled under a drive into the final
furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened then just held the show. SPEAK UNITY pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path
on the turn, drew even with the leader passing the five-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and tired
then just missed the show. DREAM FLY broke out and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, moved up on the outside then chased four wide through
the turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
AGENT CREED bumped at the start by A COLT NAMED SUSIE, who broke outwards, settled three to four wide near the rear of the field and in the clear
down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and making headway, swung five wide into upper stretch,
came under an off sided stick rallying and came inwards bumping B C GLORY DAYS into SARATOGA FLASH which in turn forced the backing away BIG
LITTLE RISK to clip that rival behind and bobble, got corrected immediately to a near sided stick and issued a challenge through the final furlong taking
command just inside the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the finish to prevail. CLEVER FELLOW three then two wide in pursuit, went three wide
through the far turn placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung three then two wide into upper stretch straightening away to take over command,
edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing lone threat to the outside and was collared just inside the sixteenth pole, ran on clear of
the rest to be along second best. B C GLORY DAYS stumbled at the start getting away last, tracked the pace along the inside from near the rear of the field,
came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, got bumped by AGENT CREED nearing the eighth pole and in turn
bumped SARATOGA FLASH, showed good courage to improve position to the finish. SARATOGA FLASH tracked the pace along the inside from just off
the pace, tipped to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
and was bumped by the aforementioned foe due to pressure outside from AGENT CREED and took over the lane of the backing away BIG LITTLE RISK
getting clipped behind by that foe, then weakened in the late stages. NOBLE CONQUEST saved ground in pursuit from mid pack coming under coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, offered up a bid taking the inside route into upper stretch, couldn't sustain the move and flattened out in the final furlong. A COLT
NAMED SUSIE broke out at the start bumping AGENT CREED, chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled out five to six wide
into upper stretch and offered up no kick. BIG LITTLE RISK established the front crossing to the inside out of the chute into the backstretch, spurted away in
hand along the rail patiently handled settling into a comfortable rhythm, came under increasing pressure through the far turn as the field took closer order,
spun just off the inside for home, yielded the front straightened away, was backing away between rivals when SARATOGA FLASH got bumped directly in
front, clipped heels with that back of that rival bobbling nearing the eighth pole, then continued to tire to the finish. TALES OF SARATOGA two to three wide
in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and tired. Please note the temporary rail is set at 9 feet down both the
backstretch and stretch but extends to 18 feet through the far turn.

Footnotes
MISS BRAZIL went straight to the front, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, drew off under a
brisk hand ride into the final sixteenth then was geared down while much the best. SLAM DUNK was taken under a hold early then rated off the pace,
stalked four wide while let out on the turn, was roused nearing the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch and safely secured the place while
no match for the winner. INVALUABLE tracked the winner on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, chased
into upper stretch and tired while best of the rest. TRUTH HURTS settled on the outside, was caught five wide early on the turn then dropped to the three
path, moved to the two path before the three-eighths and failed to threaten. PRAIRIE FIRE settled at the rear of the quintet, was urged along while inside
early on the turn then moved to the two path and failed to respond.

Footnotes
GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR tracked the front just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into
upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command inside the sixteenth pole, then edged away to the finish. NEURO two to
three wide in pursuit leading the main flight in behind a widening away pair, remained patiently handled until set down angled four wide into upper stretch,
rallied to take command a furlong from home, dug in under threat and was collared inside the sixteenth marker, ran on clear for the place honors. OCALA
DREAM just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
BAR FOURTEEN away to the front, led very early on before easing off to concede the front to AMERICAN PIPER, tracked that rival two to three wide in
closest aim before advancing five furlongs out to duel with that rival, widened away as a team through the bend taking narrow command half a mile from
home, swung three then two wide into upper stretch shaking off his main pace rival, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, weakened in the late
stages. BERNARDINO three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered
up a mild bid to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. MULTIPLE EXPANSION three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. BOLGHERI tracked the pace just off the inside until tucked inside at
the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing midway on the turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. AMERICAN PIPER coaxed from the gate,
ranged up to take command shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under threat to the outside from BAR FOURTEEN
five furlongs from home and dueled with that rival through the turn widening away from the rest and headed narrowly half a mile out, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off and tired. LUCKY BRODY three wide in pursuit, went five wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
Please note the temporary rail is set at 9 feet for both the backstretch and stretch straightaways but set at 18 feet through the far turn.

Footnotes
OVERDRESSED made solid contact with a foe at the break, settled nicely off the pace, was asked with a half-mile to run, started the turn in the two path,
shifted three then four wide later on that bend, rallied under the crop to make a bid inside the furlong marker, took the advantage into the final sixteenth and
prevailed under strong urging. BUSTINMYGROOVE stumbled at the start but recovered quickly, tracked the pace down the backstretch, made a bid in the
two path early on the turn, took a narrow advantage outside the quarter-pole, inched clear while put to the crop in upper stretch, lost the lead into the final
sixteenth and missed while clear for the place. B B'S ROCKET stalked the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, was asked outside the
three-eighths, chased under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. INVESTMENT GRADE was away alertly from the
inside post, showed the way down the backstretch, came under pressure along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole, dropped
back into upper stretch and gave way. TRIPLE DIGIT bumped soundly with a rival at the start then dropped back, settled at the rear, rounded most of the
turn in the two path, was roused while shifting four wide late on that bend, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. STAY HOME
MAMA settled outside under some urging, dropped back while four wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

VIRGINIA JOY (GER) just off the inside through the opening bend near the rear of the field, tracked the front along the inside down the backstretch before
tipping back to the two path through the far turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and angled out to swing four to five wide into upper stretch
loosely following her barn mate, offered up a good kick to to rally through the final furlong taking command a sixteenth out shaking away in the final jumps to
the finish. CAPITAL STRUCTURE (GB) tracked just off the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch, tipped three wide through the far turn
coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and advancing on the front, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch taking over command, dug in
under a drive under threat to the outside, got collared a sixteenth from home and ran on willingly clear of the rest for the place honors. CRYSTALLE along
the inside through the first turn, chased two then three wide from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced angling three to
four wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish to secure the show honors well clear of the rest. WAR CANOE two to three wide in pursuit, got
coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. FLASHING RED established the front and showed the way
along the inside past the stands and into the first turn before being taken under a rating hold into the backstretch, backed the pace down while along the
inside and came under challenge nearing the five-eighths and was displaced from the front by a pair, tracked those rivals just off the inside through the far
turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. KILKEA along the inside through the first turn, tipped out to the four
path into the backstretch taken under reserve, then advanced on the front given some rein to work with nearing the five-eighths and overthrew the leader in
concert with KISSING FROGS at that station, knocked heads through the far turn and got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got displaced in tandem
with her main sparring rival near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home loosely between foes and tired. KISSING FROGS forwardly placed just off the
inside through the first turn, tracked the leader in reserve until given some rein as KILKEA ranged up to the outside nearing the five furlong marker, took
over command at that juncture narrowly and knocked heads with KILKEA through the far turn placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got displaced from the
front near the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch still prominent, then faltered in the drive.

CROI MOR was eased back off the pace then rated in the front half of the field, began the turn in the two path, shifted four wide near the five-sixteenths,
was roused five wide into the stretch, rallied outside under the crop into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up in the final sixteenth. THAT QUALITY
went to the front under a snug hold, extended the advantage down the backstretch, traveled around the turn in the two path, responded well when asked at
the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, led determinedly under the crop into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place.
RE CREATED settled off the pace, moved in near the three-quarter pole, settled towards the front, saved ground on the turn, was roused with three furlongs
to run, came three wide into the stretch under the crop and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. ULTIMATE IRONY moved in at the rear,
settled towards the back, went around the turn in the three path while between horses, dropped in while put to a drive in upper stretch and improved
position. Z'FINALE settled comfortably off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was given his cue outside the quarter-pole then driven three wide into the
stretch, moved out around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. SUPER WICKED CHARM settled off the pace, was asked while four wide
on the turn and also lacked the needed response. A VOW OF BEAUTY was rated off the pace, went three wide between horses on the turn, was asked
nearing the quarter-pole then came five wide into the stretch under the crop and failed to rally. WHICHWAYTOMALIBU stayed well wide leaving the chute
and onto the main course, followed the solo leader down the backstretch, went around the turn in the three path, was asked outside the five-sixteenths and
lacked the needed response. I SEE THE STARS settled towards the rear, rounded the turn in the two path, was put to a drive in upper stretch and failed to
threaten. GLENN LIKES GIN was reserved towards the rear, moved to the outside around the half-mile pole, brushed with a foe at the three-eighths, went
five wide on the turn, dropped in under a drive in upper stretch and was no factor. OHYOUDIDNTKNOW was reserved towards the back, brushed with a foe
near the three-eighths, went four wide while between horses on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and also was no factor. ALLIED INVASION

came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive holding well to the finish kept to task. WUDDA U

coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive chasing the winner home willingly to the finish.
BIG ENGINE coaxed from the gate, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from
three furlongs out, went three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages while preserving the show honors. RUNNINGWSCISSORS five then
four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. CAPTAIN BOMBASTIC
coaxed along three paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened.
WINNERS LAUGH grew fractious tossing and turning his head to the near side just as the latch was sprung getting away very slowly and hitting the off side
stall at the start conceding eight to nine lengths to the front, chased three then two wide detached from the main body of the field, got coaxed along through
the turn and made some ground, went four to five wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start focusing on
WINNERS LAUGH before the result stood and the race was declared official.

PUBLIC INFORMATION was well placed near the inside while traveling comfortably, moved out around the five-sixteenths then was roused near the
quarter-pole, rallied on the outside into upper stretch, closed strongly to get the lead into the final furlong then powered away under steady handling.
JARREAU was a bit reluctant to load, stalked the pace on the outside while racing in the three path, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, took a short lead
under a drive into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner entering the final furlong and proved no match while able to get the place. STAND WITH
MO went to the front, set the pace on the inside with some company to his outside, was asked near the quarter-pole then lost the advantage into upper
stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. FUTURO settled while saving ground, was roused on the far
turn, came out into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. CRACKER BOX PALACE dropped back while taken up while coming in off heels at the
start, settled at the rear in the two path, shifted four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DECLAREATRUCE went three to four wide on the turns and
was no factor. LOTSNLOTSOFCHROME settled on the outside, was urged four then five wide on the far turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop and
failed to respond. MACLEAN'S LEGACY was rated off the pace, came up empty in the three path on the far turn and faltered.
