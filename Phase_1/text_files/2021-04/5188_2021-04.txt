Footnotes
DRINK never far back, closed willingly in the six path through deep stretch and got up in the final strides. MIGHTY FAST stalked the pace from the inside,
shifted out, surged two wide to make the lead midway on the far turn, set the balance of the pace and just missed hanging on. NOBLE BEHAVIOR settled
mid pack along the inside, shifted out to the six path entering the stretch then passed tiring rivals. SMASH was hustled from the start to set the pace along
the inside into the second turn then gradually weakened. GILES saved ground to no avail. TROPICAL CYCLONE was no threat. INHERITTHEWIND was no
factor. WATCH YOUR STEP chased the pace for a half then stopped.

POLE SETTER prompted the pace three then two wide into the stretch, dug in determinedly under right handed urging in the four path, made the lead in
deep stretch and drew clear under strong handling. ROSKILDE away alertly, set a pressured pace into the stretch, shook clear before the furlong marker
then couldn't handle the winner in the final stages. D'MONEY HONEY trailed into the turn then closed fast late in the three path. DAD'S YANKEES pressed
the early pace, along the inside, steadied and shifted out near the seven sixteenths pole then went evenly. KHALFANI well placed, failed to respond. TIO
PERICO was no factor. CROCKETTS BLUFF was no threat. GIANT BOO BOO stalked the pace from the inside for a half, suffered and injury entering the

the winner. FRIDAY never far back, finished well along the inside. CARINA close up, rallied three wide on the far turn, made the lead in upper stretch then
was outfinished. CHECK SIX failed to menace. LA CAFETERA made the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside for six furlongs then
weakened. POWER BANKER stalked the early pace, rallied two wide on the far turn, led briefly near the quarter pole then came up empty. PURDY BIRDIE

Footnotes
ISOLATOR broke alertly, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and maintained his advantage under brisk handling. CALIFORNIA MARTINI chased the
winner and finished well clear for second in the four path. MANDATORY MASK chased the pace along the inside and faded in the stretch. AWESOME OX
failed to menace. ON TEMPLE HIGH passed tiring rivals. POWER IMAGE had brief speed. CHOCOLATE SOLDIER was no factor. NAMATH was outrun.
