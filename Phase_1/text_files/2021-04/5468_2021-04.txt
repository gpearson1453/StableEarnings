Footnotes
INCREDIBLE CHAMP stalked the early pace of FINE RED RESERVE, kept pressure on the pacesetter through the second turn while two wide, vied for the
lead entering the drive, wore down the pacesetter in the last sixteenth, and held on over late pressure from ERRIGAL. ERRIGAL had no speed early, was
three wide along the second turn while still toward the rear, and made a late rally in the stretch to mildly pressure INCREDBILE CHAMP while holding for
second. FINE RED RESERVE set the pace through the second turn, saved ground, was confronted entering the stretch by INCREDIBLE CHAMP and could
not hold that foe off and tired in the stretch but held on for third. RUNNING TO WIN bobbled at the start,settled in the middle of the pack, was three wide
along the second turn while improving position but could not go on with that bid and finished evenly in the stretch. RIVER KAI settled toward the rear of the
field, was two wide along the second turn while dueling for position, lost ground off the turn and had no late rally in the stretch. TRIBUNAL LOVE chased the
early pace, lost position along the second turn while two wide and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
TROUBLE N PARADISE settled just off of the early pace, was two wide along the turn while close up, drifted out entering the stretch, then kicked on under
right handed encouragement to be clear late. SWANEE set the pace through the backstretch and turn, was two wide along the turn, was confronted by
TROUBLE N PARADISE inside the eighth pole and could not hold that foe off but did hold for second. BEE EINSTEIN collided with CHARGING HOME at
the start, pressed the pace from a ground saving position, was still close up entering the lane but was outfinished by the top two. CALIFORNIA COMET was
allowed to settle early, improved position along the turn while three wide, but could not go on with that run and finished evenly in the stretch. CHARGING
HOME collided with BEE EINSTEIN leaving the starting gate, settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide along the turn, and tired in the stretch run.
CLOCHARD STREET settled in the middle of the pack, lost position along the turn while saving ground, and weakened in the stretch run. INCREDIBLY
LUCKY had no early speed, was four wide along the turn while trailing and had no late response in the stretch drive.

two path for the drive and had a late kick to prevail. WILD WAGER was allowed to settle early, saved ground along the second turn, improved position into
the stretch but was outkicked by the winner while still second best. ASSET settled in the middle of the pack, improved position along the turn while three
wide, but could not continue that bid and was outfinished by the top two. LUCA'S RIDE dueled for pace duties with PAPA'S HONEY through the second
turn, saved ground along the second turn, was confronted into the stretch and weakened late. WALKING WITH DINO chased the early pace, lost position
along the backstretch, saved ground along the second turn, and had no rally in the stretch. PAPA'S HONEY dueled for pace duties with LUCA'S RIDE
through the second turn, lost position into the stretch and gave out in the drive. BLUE SUNSET broke inward at the start, was unhurried early, was three

RESPECT THE HUSTLE was well placed pressing the pace to the second turn, moved up to engage for the lead in upper stretch, inched to the front a
sixteenth out and held determinedly. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) trailed to the second turn, circled four wide then was widest for the drive and closed steadily
in the middle of the course. SOBERANO (FR) tracked the pace to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch then finished willingly but was bested late.
SIZZLING JAMIE had no speed, settled to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. MO BOB (IRE)
hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail for six furlongs then was overtaken in mid stretch and weakened. TORPEDO AWAY stalked the pace from the
rail to the second turn but tired in the drive.

GAYLES EVENING was sent from the start, set the pace through the turn, was pressured late by KITTY'S CANDY but held on to prevail. KITTY'S CANDY
had no speed early, sat behind foes while two wide on the turn, swung out for racing room into the stretch and made a late rally, but could not quite reel in
the winner. AUSTRIAN NAVY stalked the early pace, was three wide between horses on the turn while close up, gained into the stretch and was an easy
third. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN settled in the middle of the pack, was two wide between horses on the turn while close up, but could not go on with that run and
tired in the stretch run. POINT BREAK chased the early pace, saved ground along the turn while close up, lost position into the stretch and weakened in the
late stages. BOLD MISTRESS had no speed early, came four wide along the turn to contend, but could not go on with that run into the stretch and gave out
in the drive.

Footnotes
SHARMEL was bumped off stride by JUMPING JILL FLASH, pushed up to chase the pace three wide, shifted out for room once in the stretch, rallied when
clear and closed steadily to prevail. TIM'S STREET GIRL stalked the pace to the turn, was four wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid stretch but
could not stall the winner. JUMPING JILL FLASH broke inward, bumped the winner at the start, had no speed, trailed while saving ground to the stretch then
finished willingly but too late. PERFECT EDITION attended the pace off the rail to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. A CARD SHORT
hustled to contest the pace outside of PERFECT EDITION, was three wide to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch but the runnerup and also weakened.
AFTER SUNDOWN had no speed, raced two wide on the turn then swung out for room into the stretch but came up empty. ICE KITTY was outsprinted to
the turn, raced four wide to the stretch, also swung out in upper stretch but lacked a closing response. SUPER BUNNY chased the pace three wide, swung
widest for the drive but did not rally.
