SAPPHIRE SILK led contested pace along the rail on the backstretch, continued to lead entering the turn, shook free from rival entering the stretch, and
stayed clear in the lane. SOME ROYALTY chased leaders two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch in the two path and
kept to task to get up for second. TRUTH PREVAILS broke in and dueled with rival two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide pressing the pace,
proved no match for rival entering the stretch and saved show. GODDESS APHRODITE bobbled at the start, went to rail stalking the pace, continued along
the inside on the turn, looked full of run entering the stretch and found a seam along the rail, prompted by rider and failed to make enough progress.
MONGOLIAN SUNRISE chased leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered stretch in the four path and failed to make
enough progress.
