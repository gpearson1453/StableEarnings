NEWS BREAK chased the pace early on, was in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane, had a late surge while three wide and just up at the wire.
CANE CREEK ROAD set the pace early on, was on the inside into the lane, inched clear down the lane, slightly drifted out near the eighth pole, carried on
and was nailed at the wire while between foes. SUMMER PALACE stalked the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane, made a bid in the stretch, altered
inward near the eighth pole, had a late bid but missed in the final stages. EXULT was bumped at the start and raced back early on, was on the inside into
the lane, made a bid in the stretch from the rail but hung in the final stages. CASANOVA KITTEN broke through the gate in the pre-start, chased the pace
early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid down the lane, the rider lost the whip late and flattened out in the final stages. FIELDSTONE raced back
early on, was in the six path into the lane with a mild gain in the stretch run. A. K. SAFARI was in the seven path into the lane and raced evenly. MAJESTIC
RO chased the pace early on, raced four wide along the far turn, was in the five path into the lane and weakened late in the drive. THE HUMONGOUS ONE
was never a factor. KILLER BEE tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
DERBY DATE bumped with an outer foe at the start, pressed the pace three wide, bid at the three furlong pole, drew away from his inner counterparts at the
five sixteenths pole, widened to a clear margin in upper stretch, met PLEDGOFALLEGIANCE's rail challenge in the final furlong, and just held.
PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE was bumped by rivals on both sides at the start, tracked from midpack along the inside while under steady, but mild, urging,
shifted three wide turning for home, split foes in upper stretch with a clear DERBY DATE to catch, rallied to produce a bid inside of that foe approaching the
wire, but just missed. CAPTAIN HANK lied off of the pace in the three path around the turn, swung five wide entering the lane, and stayed on for a minor
share. DIAMOND STATE vied along the inside, but quickly failed to keep pace with DERBY DATE approaching the five sixteenths pole, and faded through
the lane. MAGICIAN'S HOLIDAY set the pace outside of an inner vying rival, but proved no match for an outer bidding foe at the five sixteenths pole, and
weakened between horses in upper stretch. JERRY'S SECRET bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked from midpack four wide around the turn, but
failed to make an impacct. COFFEE BREAK was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
BROOKE MARIE was chirped at through opening furlong to achieve an inside forward position early on, stalked the clear leader while shifting to the two
path into the turn, bid while being floated to the four path at the quarter pole, dueled while being subtly herded outwards through upper stretch by her inner
counterpart, but forged an advantage passing the furlong marker, and inched clear thereafter. CHILI PETIN cleared early on, showed the way around the
turn, shifted to the three path at the quarter pole while meeting BROOKE MARIE's bid, drifted out slightly while digging in and sustaining a duel, but was
headed by her outer foe passing the furlong grounds, and proved second best. VIOLENZA lied far off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path
while awaiting racing room behind traffic at the quarter pole split foes in midstretch, and stayed on for a minor share. SONG RIVER tracked from midpack
three to four wide around the turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane to stay outside of the leaders, but drifted outwards passing the three sixteenths
marker while trying to commence a rally, and chased the leaders home evenly. MORE got caught five wide around the turn while in midpack, and stayed on
mildly outside of foes through the lane, but failed to threaten. NO WAY JOSE (IRE) lied far off of the pace in the two to three path around the turn, split foes
while improving in midstretch, but failed to menace. HEAVEN ESCAPE trailed around the turn, swung to the five path entering the lane, then the seven path
in upper stretch, and improved without factoring. READY FOR CHANGE stalked two wide, got kept on the three path by an inner foe, then hung on his left
lead through the lane while fading between horses. STRONG ODOR maneuvered to the rail while off of the pace down the backstretch, then saved ground
around the turn, but to no avail. NOTORIOUS R B G lied forwardly placed three wide, but faded at the three furlong pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
SOUTH BEND settled far off of the pace, rallied five wide around the far turn before getting floated six wide entering the lane, but sustained his field-circling
advance through the lane to bid for the lead a sixteenth out, and drove clear. EMPTY TOMB took a bump to his hind quarters a few strides out of the gates,
tracked from midpack three wide, inched closer to prompt the pace outside of a pair of foes into the far turn before bidding for the lead at the five sixteenths
pole, sparked a duel entering the lane, hung on his left lead through midstretch while sustaining the battle, but was outkicked by an outer rallying foe a
sixteenth out, and prevailed for place. MIGHTY HEART was bumped by an outer rival into an inner rival soon after the start, recovered to set the pace into
the first turn, cleared off into the backstretch, but met a pair of bids into the far turn, showed the way from those foe entering the lane, dueled gamely inside
of those rivals through the stretch, but yielded approaching the wire. ROYAL MESA stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading trio entering the
lane, grinded away at their advantage while between horses, but was outkicked by an outer rival a sixteenth out, then stayed on to miss reaching show.
TOP SEED had a visible layer of sweat on his neck during the post parade and leading to the gate, stalked two wide, came under coaxing to bid for the lead
into the far turn as EMPTY TOMB forced his hand, vied between horses around that bend, sustained the duel through midstretch, but gave way a sixteenth
from home. FINAL JEOPARDY lied off of the pace in the two path around the first turn, took back to shift outside of foes down the backstretch, took the far
turn in the four path before drifting to the five path entering the lane, but failed to rally. CODE RUNNER was outrun.

SAY THE WORD tracked from midpack in the three path, tugged into the backstretch to a three wide stalking position, bid for the lead outside of CHANNEL
CAT at the five sixteenths pole, dueled with that rival through upper stretch, but forged an advantage from that foe at the furlong pole, and edged clear
thereafter. CHANNEL CAT lied forwardly placed from the two path, inched closer into the far turn, bid for the lead inside of SAY THE WORD at the five
sixteenths pole, clung to an advantage from that one while dueling through upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong pole, gave way, but held place.
CRAFTY DADDY stalked along the inside, then from the two path around the third turn before shifting to the four path entering the lane to be outside of the
dueling leaders, chased them well through the lane, gained ground on place through the late stages, but missed reaching that position on the wire.
FANTASIOSO (ARG) saved ground at the rear of the field through the opening two turns, gained mildly three wide around the far turn, swung six wide
entering the lane while sustaining his advance, but leveled off through the lane, and chased the leaders home. NORTH DAKOTA lied off of the pace along
the inside and from the two path around the turns, came into the lane in the four path while attempting to swing outwards, but decided to shift inwards
instead in upper stretch, but lacked a rail rally. RED KNIGHT lied at the rear of the field two to three wide, mildly gained around the far turn before swinging
five wide entering the lane, but flattened out and faded between horses in upper stretch. TIDE OF THE SEA prompted the pace two wide, vied around the
second turn, showed the way down the backstretch, shifted inwards into the far turn before meeting a pair of bids at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened
entering the lane. EPIC BROMANCE set the pace far off of the rail early on, showed the way in the two path around the first turn while TIDE OF THE SEA
pressed, vied inside of that foe around the second turn, pressed that foe into the backstretch, but faded at the half mile pole, and was eased through the
lane. PER THE KENTUCKY RACING COMMISSION, FANTASIOSO (ARG) HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
HIGH FIVE COTTON lied forwardly placed four wide, rallied through the lane to wear down the clear leader in the final sixteenth, and safely held from CANT
SAY NO to the wire. CAN'T SAY NO lied far off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, swung six wide turning for home, rallied to produce a
gaining bid approaching the wire, but did not have enough to catch the leader. NORTH ELKHORN was reluctant to load, but broke sharp and cleared early
on, shifted to the two path entering the lane, repelled NICE WORK's bid in upper stretch, held an advantage to the final sixteenth, but was nailed in the final
stages. LOOPALLU tracked from midpack along the inside, saved ground turning for home before attempting a rail bid through the lane, but flattened out.
KATE'S GOLDEN DUDE lied off of the pace three wide around the turn, and improved through the lane. RED BLUE AND TRUE tracked from midpack while
caught five wide around the turn, but hung on his left lead through the lane and failed to produce a bid. NICE WORK stalked along the inside, shifted outside
of the clear leader into the turn, but failed to keep pace with that rival in upper stretch, and tired. CELTIC MISCHIEF lied forwardly placed three wide and
from between horses, but faded passing the quarter pole. RIVERS OF LITE lied far off of the pace along the inside around the turn, and failed to make an
impact. STATE TREASURER bumped with an inner foe at the start, and never got involved. FINNEGAN (IRE) chased two wide, but weakened into the turn,
and was done early. MY GIRL ROCKET was outrun throughout, and showed little.
