LARGE was urged dictating the pace on a narrow margin inside rivals to the backstretch, repelled a rival's challenge on the far turn, edged clear racing into
upper stretch and just held IT'S MANDATORY to the end under firm left handed pressure. The latter was bumped at the start, settled last racing to the first
turn, switched outside foes on the backstretch, steadily advanced on the leaders three wide through the far turn to upper stretch and continued willingly to
the end to challenge the winner nearing the wire. BLACK V. K., in touch prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, briefly pressed that rival racing
into the far turn but weakened in the drive. BATTLE CREEK tracked off the leaders outside a rival to the backstretch and offered no rally. RED HOOD was
urged to a forward placing three wide tracking just off the leaders but steadily faded racing into the far turn. FLEETRIDGE broke outwards bumping IT'S
MANDATORY, was righted to track the leaders along the inside to the backstretch but retreated early.

Footnotes
EASY DAY tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside, switched out nearing upper stretch, took over leaving midstretch and kicked away under some
right handed pressure. DRAMA CHORUS broke sharply, set the pace along the inside, went clear nearing upper stretch but proved no match when
confronted by the winner. RILEYS DUDE, in touch prompting the pace to the turn, faded into upper stretch. SANDY KISS angled inwards to track off the
second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. FALLEN EMPIRE tracked off the second flight, was fanned five wide into upper
stretch but made no real impression. IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted four wide into the lane and
gave way. FOGGY ALBION was always outpaced.

JUSTAHOLIC broke inwards bumping JAZZY TIMES forcing him into the path of WHERE'S JORDAN, was righted, then urged to the lead along the inside
setting the pace on a narrow margin, shook clear racing into upper stretch, was roused to midstretch and widened late while being taken in hand in the
closing stages. JAZZY TIMES, bumped at the start, was rated along the inside tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance racing into the turn
and continued with interest into the lane to prove best of the others. FIREMAN OSCAR settled last along the inside racing to the turn, switched off the inside
in upper stretch, then split foes in the closing stages while finding his best stride late to prevail for a share. WHERE'S JORDAN, bumped at the start, angled
to the inside tracking well off the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. ARCADIA CALLS tracked the
pacesetter between foes in the opening stages but faded between foes leaving midstretch. OUR MAN LUKE settled outside foes dropping off the second
flight racing to the turn and failed to menace thereafter. POSEIDON'S PASSION angled inwards while being urged prompting a rival's pace racing to the
turn, gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
INTO PARADISE broke sharply, angled to the inside setting the pace on a clear margin, held sway on a commanding advantage racing into the stretch and
was kept to firm encouragement. TRADITION tracked off the second flight near the inside racing to the turn, split foes racing into upper stretch and proved
best of the others. OUR GREY GHOST tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight, angled to the inside entering the turn and finished evenly in
late stages. MEETYOUATTHEDELTA tracked the pacesetter inside foes in second flight, switched out racing into the turn while making brief pursuit of the
winner but faded into upper stretch. PAPA HONOR tracked the leader four wide, then three wide racing into the turn in second flight, was fanned four wide
nearing the lane and faded into upper stretch. PACIFIC LEGEND tracked off the second flight three deep between foes, angled to the inside on the turn but
lacked a rally. SARATOGA DANCER was outpaced early and proved no threat. WICKED MOMENT tracked off the second flight four wide on the
backstretch and soon dropped out. CHINA BEACH was through early.

Footnotes
HAIL TO THE KING, reserved outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, advanced four wide racing through the far turn and produced a solid
closing response to reel in STOPIT in time under firm handling to prevail. The latter, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the pacesetter, shifted in on
the backstretch advancing to press the issue into the far turn, went well clear racing into upper stretch but couldn't fend off the winner. ESTILO PELIGROSO
settled inside foes in the last flight to the backstretch, switched outside rivals entering the far turn and continued with a steady effort three wide into the lane
to edge rivals for a share. SILENT MISCHIEF, unhurried three deep between foes in the opening stages, improved position between rivals into the lane.
DEBDURITE tracked the leaders between foes from well out of striking distance, lost some position after a half but continued evenly between foes into the
stretch to regain some position while no real threat. COURTING MOONLIGHT settled between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn,
was fanned six wide into upper stretch but passed only tiring rivals. MONEY HOUSE, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter to the
backstretch, steadily faded into the far turn. OUTSTANDING DEBT tracked the leaders from out of striking distance along the rail and faded early. FREE
FLAYME sprinted to the lead along the inside, set the pace to the far turn and abruptly gave out entering the lane. BLAME BISHOP, forwardly placed
between foes tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
OPULENT WAYS, forwardly placed along the rail prompting the pace into the backstretch, was eased back off the pace after a half, tracked just off the
pacesetter along the inside racing into the far turn, switched out nearing upper stretch while being roused to advance in the three path and continued
grudgingly in a protracted skirmish while being carried out in the last furlong to wrest a narrow advantage in time under firm handling. THATS ALL
SHEWROTE broke readily, forced the pace outside the eventual winner racing to the backstretch, went clear after a half, dictated the pace to upper stretch,
then resisted the winner's bid to the end while drifting out markedly in the closing stages. PATSY'S BIG GIRL, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off
the leaders to the backstretch, continued willingly just outside those foes to the end while edging rivals for a share. FIRST GOLD, cut off at the start, settled
last along the inside racing to the far turn, switched out in upper stretch to split foes three wide in the closing stages but continued with interest to just miss
for a share. WHAT A KNOCKOUT, bumped at the start, angled inwards to track just off the first flight between foes racing to the far turn, angled to the rail
racing into upper stretch but had no final kick. DANCING IN FIRE, reserved along the inside early, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch while being
roused to advance but had no closing bid. NO VALLA, caught in tight quarters, then taken up racing into the first turn, never regained contention. WATCH
ME TANGO ducked out at the start bumping a rival, was rank under restraint between foes while being carried out on the first turn and offered no rally.
CLAP FOR ME tracked just off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch but faded early. TWO DRINK MINIMUM, reluctant to load, was forced wide
racing into the first turn and was through after a half.

Footnotes
ALABAMA SLAMMER broke readily, angled inwards leaving the chute disputing the pace inside rivals racing to the turn, pressed the issue nearing the lane
to gain a clear advantage in upper stretch, then came under strong handling to just hold LIGHT US UP on even terms at the wire. The latter angled inwards
in the opening stages, tracking the first flight from out of striking distance, shifted out on the turn to advance on the leaders four wide into upper stretch, then
continued with a steady late response to collar ALABAMA SLAMMER on the wire to share the win. SHOO SHINE, forwardly placed four wide in the opening
stages attending the pace, pressed the pace three wide on the turn but flattened out in upper stretch. COMMITTEEMAN switched out leaving the chute to
press the pace between foes through the backstretch into the turn and gave way leaving midstretch. BEAR BRIAN, forced in at the start, was settled out of
striking distance and never gained contention. PIRATE PARADE was a brief factor between foes prompting the pace but faded early. CROSS OF GALILEE
broke inwards bumping BEAR BRIAN, was pulled up on the backstretch but walked off the course under his own power.

Footnotes
DOMAIN was settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch, gained some position inside foes entering the far turn, swung out five wide in upper
stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling, then was taken in hand nearing the wire. I AM THAT I AM
settled between foes in the last flight racing to the far turn, shifted out to split foes three wide midstretch to bid for command, gained a brief advantage
between calls late and held grudgingly for second. OBIWAN tracked off the first flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance on the leaders angling out four wide in upper stretch and continued with interest between foes in that path while being outkicked for second.
WINTER'S WONDER tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, angled out nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance,
then shifted out of close quarters while being fanned six wide late but had no late kick. LAST PROMISE sprinted to the lead while angling to the rail racing to
the first turn, held sway on a clear margin to the far turn, dueled inside foes into the lane and gave way leaving midstretch. CADET CONNELLY, forwardly
placed tracking just off the pacesetter, switched out prompting that rival racing into the far turn, dueled between foes to midstretch and gave out late. IDLE
TIME, forwardly placed three wide, pressed the issue on the far turn and gave way between foes leaving midstretch. RECORDER tracked off the second
flight outside foes to the backstretch but offered no rally. LIZ MORE BOY tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, but was through after a half.
FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF WINTER'S WONDER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF OBIWAN ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

HIGHTIME VALENTINE tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening stages, was prompted to gain position three wide between foes racing
through the turn, moved to split rivals challenging for command racing past the furlong marker and edged forward in late stages under firm left handed
pressure. NURSE JUDY, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the turn, moved to challenge for command in that path
racing into upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid but was outkicked late. BUMBLELICIOUS tracked off the second flight outside foes on the backstretch,
advanced on the leaders four wide through the turn to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. JADA'S KINGDOM tracked off the second flight along
the inside, saved ground on the turn, then switched out four wide racing through the stretch while finishing evenly. ATLANTIC PRINCESS, urged to a
forward placing along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, bid for command inside foes nearing the lane but faded leaving midstretch.
SMOKIN CLASS sprinted to the lead outside foes, angled inside once clear setting the pace racing into the turn but gave way between foes entering upper
stretch. CHERRY ROCK BRIDGE settled outside foes in the last flight, was fanned five wide into the lane and proved no threat. MAGIC SOLUTION settled
between foes in the last flight, shifted out four wide racing into the lane but never menaced. TWIN BRIDGES, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter
into the turn, gave way early.

Footnotes
CULTURAL MANDATE joined the pace three wide just after the break, angled to the inside while being prompted to gain a clear advantage nearing the turn,
forged clear racing into upper stretch and widened under pressure. MERMAID KISSES tracked just off the first flight outside a rival racing into the turn, was
fanned four wide into the lane but continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors. FIFTYSHADESOGRAYCE, urged between foes pursuing the
pacesetter from the outset to upper stretch, weakened late. FIELD LETTERS was rated off the second flight along the inside, switched out racing into the
turn and made an effort to gain position between foes in late stages. SOME SAY SO was steadied a bit avoiding tight quarters along the inside in the
opening stages, tracked the leaders along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch but proved empty in the drive. BURBANK
ROAD worked his way to the inside dropping off the second flight, saved ground to the lane but had no closing bid. LIGHTS DOWN LOW hopped at the
start, settled outside foes racing to the turn and failed to menace. TREASURED INFO broke inwards bumping THE OTHER CAT, was caught four wide
tracking the leaders in second flight and gave way racing into the turn. THE OTHER CAT, bumped at the start, settled between foes and failed to menace.
GIPSEY SORCERESS dropped out early.
