crop then held the runner-up behind horses, gained the advantage under a strong drive into the final furlong, disposed of DAZZLE TIME into the final
sixteenth and moved clear under steady urging. LEMON DROP ROAD was well spotted just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused inside the
five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path then was kept in behind the leader by the winner, dropped to the inside then was put to the crop,
altered out inside the furlong marker and finished willingly for the place. DAZZLE TIME was hustled from the start, set the pace under pressure to his
outside, shook clear in the two path on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for
the show. ABSOLUTE COURAGE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved out then advanced outside under urging, chased in the four path
on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired. OVEREXAGGERATE dropped back while lacking speed under urging on the outside, went
four wide on the turn and was no factor. ISLANDMAN moved out early then was urged along off the pace, dropped back on the turn and faltered.

GRINGOTTS coaxed from the gate, dueled two to three wide with MEBS WEB to her outside taking slight advantage five furlongs from home, tucked inside
through the turn and had an additional pair advance outside and vied inside a trio through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths when
displaced from the front, took the inside route into upper stretch, came again inside to poke a head in front nearing the eighth pole, dug in under threat from
a pair knocking heads with those foes through to the finish growing a bit weary from slugging it out, came out under a near sided stick inside the final
sixteenth herding LOTTIE'S MISSION out two paths while holding a slim advantage, got corrected to straighten course and gamely held on at the wire.
LOTTIE'S MIZZION five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide and advanced in tandem with JARA to her outside through the turn to
vie between foes placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, took narrow and brief command swinging four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was
directed inwards just inside the eighth pole to look the aforementioned foe in the eye between rivals as JARA continued on the outside, dug in under an off
sided stick and had GRINGOTTS come outwards and was herded two paths inside the final sixteenth fighting on gamely while growing a bit weary to the
wire but was ultimately denied at the end. JARA six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide into the turn advancing to vie outside a trio
through the bend put to coaxing three furlongs from home, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive knocking heads through the final eighth
with the aforementioned pair battling on game all out and growing a bit weary but ultimately missed at the end. MANI PEDI chased three then two wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MEBS WEB hustled from the gate, dueled three
then two wide with GRINGOTTS to her inside, tucked to the two path through the turn and was joined outside by a pair and vied between foes through the
turn coaxed along from midway, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away and weakened. MICROMILLION hustled from
the gate, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside for home and trailed throughout. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into deep stretch as well as a Jockey's objection by the rider of LOTTIE'S MIZZION
alleging interference against GRINGOTTS in deep stretch, After review, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

when set down in upper stretch, drifted out some late and held gamely under strong urging. GIRAMONTE bumped with a rival just after the start, showed
speed on the inside of foes then was eased back and rated just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole, moved
out inside the three-sixteenths then bumped with a foe, chased into the final sixteenth, gained on the winner late and just missed while able to get the place.
ME 'N SAP stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was bumped by the runner-up in upper stretch, chased the winner to the wire
and was outfinished while able to get the show. UNLIKELY bumped with a rival after the start, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn,
pursued the leader in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. ROGUE LEADER was urged along early then taken in hand near the nine-sixteenths, went
three wide while let on the turn, was driven into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. FREUDIAN ANALYST was urged along on the outside, went
three wide on the turn, was driven into upper stretch, raced between horses in the final furlong and gained some but failed to menace.
SIMBASALLTROUBLE moved out near the five-eighths, settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, steadied some under extra left-rein guidance
outside the quarter-pole, was put to a drive in upper stretch, moved out inside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. DREAMPOINT broke a bit slow then
dropped back, went four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and also failed to threaten. JACK'S DREAM broke a bit slow then dropped
back, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. RESILIENT KINDAGUY was ridden along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and failed to respond.
KISS'N MISSION was taken back early then angled in, drifted out near the five-eighths, went three wide on the turn, came three wide into the stretch,

Footnotes
INDIAN COUNSELOR coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside in aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three wide into
upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, dug in under threat under an off sided stick, struck the whip from the hands of his main danger
inadvertently in the final strides and held game to the end. TAPIZEARANCE five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
angled out five wide into upper stretch and rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong, came under a near sided stick latched on the top one
through to the finish briefly getting his whip stuck on the rider of INDIAN COUNSELOR before dislodging it only to have it struck from his left hand strides
from the finish and was ultimately denied at the finish. TRI SAINT LORENZO chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path half a mile from home,
came under coaxing midway on the turn and swung five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to secure the show honors. SOCIAL GROUP
prompted the pace four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, weakened in the final furlong while passing a tired
rival for minor spoils. LIAM'S FIRE established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from the aforementioned foe
and coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, got collared a furlong out and weakened in the late going.
LATIN LOVE BUG four then three wide in pursuit, tucked to the two path through the turn and got placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.

MANDATE was hustled leaving the gate, went three wide on the first turn, settled comfortably in second position, ranged up in the three path on the far turn,
rallied to the lead under a drive in upper stretch, fought with TIME TO TESTIFY until near the sixteenth-pole then drew clear under strong urging. BAD GUY
was taken up while in tight after the start, was reserved off the pace in the two path, departed the backstretch under tight restraint while just off heels, moved
to the three path while let out midway through the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the place. TIME TO TESTIFY moved in
while going to the front, set the clear pace in the two path, was set down into upper stretch, lost the lead inside the three-sixteenths, battled with the winner
until the sixteenth-pole then proved no match and lost the place while narrowly able to get the show. PERCEIVED brushed with a rival on the initial
straightaway, settled on the outside while four wide, was roused on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and weakened. LIFE ON TOP went three wide on
the first turn, settled towards the rear, moved out while traveling a bit awkwardly late on the backstretch, went four then five wide on the far turn, was driven
into upper stretch, paused between horses late and missed the superfecta. FUTURE VICTORY was taken up while in tight after the start, settled towards
the rear, went around the turns in the two path and came up empty. SHOOTIN THE BREEZE jostled with a foe on the initial straightaway, went two to three
wide while pulling under a hold on the first turn, was rated off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two to three path, was roused into upper stretch and came
up empty. SIMPLY saved ground at the rear of the field, came out into the stretch then moved further out and was no factor. MR. KRINGLE jostled with a
rival on the opening straightaway, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the far turn then driven five wide into the
stretch and failed to rally. THE SINNER IS YOU jostled with foes on both sides on the opening straightaway, went three to four wide on the turns, came five
wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to respond. ANZIO BEACH was asked leaving the gate, settled on the inside, came up empty on the
final turn and faltered.

AJHAR six paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit from mid pack, tucked four wide through the turn and came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, got brushed at the three-sixteenths by SAVOY who tipped out a path from the inside, dug in rallying in
tandem with that rival to issue a challenge through to the finish getting bumped by SAVOY a sixteenth from home as CONTINUATION came out forcing
SAVOY to steady between, held firm to his path absorbing the contact and was up in the final jumps to prevail. CONTINUATION broke out at the start
bumping COUSIN ANDREW, dueled four wide with GOLDENITE to his inside before tucking to the two path into the turn, knocked heads with GOLDENITE
through the bend taking over narrow command just before swinging three to four wide into upper stretch, inched away under a drive getting out near the
eighth pole before being corrected, dug in under threat from a trio and came out a sixteenth from home forcing SAVOY to bump AJHAR before steadying,
got clipped behind in the process under danger and was nailed in the final strides. ROYAL REALM brushed the near side stall and bobbled at the start,
chased five wide down the backstretch getting taken under a firm hold off heels six and then five furlongs from home when pulling a bit eager, went four
wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, closed in under a drive angling in a path a sixteenth out and
missed at the end. SAVOY three then two wide in pursuit, came under a ride at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, tipped out a path at the
three-sixteenths brushing AJHAR, rallied in concert with that rival to threaten inside the final furlong, attempted to lean out on AJHAR bumping that rival
when CONTINUATION came out a sixteenth from home in front and was denied the move and forced to steady clipping the back heels of CONTINUATION
at that station getting shut off and paused, recovered to finish under his own power clear for the last major share. COUSIN ANDREW bumped at the start by
CONTINUATION, who broke outwards, chased just off the inside and pulled a bit eager being taken under a hard held six furlongs from home and then
once more inside the five-eighths before being wrangled off heels of the leader at the nine-sixteenths, tucked inside through the turn, cut the corner into
upper stretch under urging and weakened. GOLDENITE established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside knocking heads with
CONTINUATION to the outside, tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front and spun just off the inside for
home, then weakened in the stretch. OR'EFFICE showed brief speed five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn and
began to fade from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch as well as a Jockey's
Objection by the rider of SAVOY alleging interference against CONTINUATION at the sixteenth pole. After review, it was deemed that CONTINUATION had
interfered with SAVOY at the sixteenth marker and CONTINUATION was disqualified from second and placed fourth before the race was declared official.

Footnotes
WINTERS BACK went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, was well rated while setting the pace on an easy lead as several foes were under
vigorous restraint, picked up the tempo while inside on the far turn, spun into the two path entering the stretch then responded well when asked for his best
and held under strong urging. BODECREAM brushed with a rival at the start, was placed under a very snug hold early, went three wide on the first turn,
stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, chased three wide into the stretch, pursued the winner under a drive and finished
with good courage for the place. PRICE TALK was rated on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and
finished willingly for the show. GOOD GOVERNANCE (GB) was restless in the gate, came under a tight hold early, was rated off the pace while three to four
wide, ranged up on the far turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch, chased outside in the lane and was out-kicked then just missed the show. EMARAATY
(GB) was taken under a tight hold early, went four wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, moved closer while four wide on the far turn, was roused
five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. MALTHAEL brushed with an opponent at the start, was taken under a vigorous hold early, tugged very
hard at the bit under stout restraint while keen between horses, went two to three wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace while continuing to fight
restraint amongst foes, dropped back near the three-eighths, was asked in the two path on the far turn and came up empty. DANNY CALIFORNIA was
taken back between horses leaving the chute then angled in, settled towards the rear while saving ground, was roused on the far turn, moved out in upper
stretch and failed to threaten. ACKER rounded the first turn in the two path, was unhurried at the rear, raced three wide on the far turn, came four wide into
the stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and was no factor.

ON THE MUSCLE chased along the inside down the backstretch near the rear of the field, tipped to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, angled out to swing seven wide into upper stretch, closed well outside getting joined by THRUSTER near the sixteenth marker to
overthrow the top pair just inside seventy yards to go and just got the nod on the wire by a sliver. THRUSTER bumped at the start by CENTURION, who
broke out a step, chased three wide from near the rear coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch following the
aforementioned foe before tipping out slightly straightened away, offered up a good finish to close well outside that rival and overhauled the top in concert
with ON THE MUSCLE just inside seventy yards from home, then just missed on the line by the slimmest of margins. LOADED JOE coaxed from the gate,
angled in to chase two to three wide in aim of the leader, made steady progress through the turn and was set down four wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive battling head to head with KENTUCKY KNIGHT from the eighth pole until poking head in front seventy yards from home before being over
taken by the top pair, fought on to the finish to preserve the show honors. KENTUCKY KNIGHT coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, narrowly, dug in knocking heads from
that station to the final seventy yards when relenting command and was along for the last major share when outfinished in the final jumps to the wire.
CENTURION broke out at the start bumping THRUSTER, chased three then two wide from mid pack coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out
five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. SIXTEEN TONS got brushed at the start by CAMOUFLAGED KISSER, who broke inwards a step,
chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled four wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. CAMOUFLAGED KISSER broke in a step at the start brushing SIXTEEN TONS, chased four then three wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and weakened in the late stages. CONFECTIONER chased just off the inside until tucked inside
at the seven-sixteenths, came under a ride three furlongs from home, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish but was
outkicked. BOURBON RISING chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
RATCHET broke out at the start and was corrected, got lightly coaxed along to establish the front and showed the way safely free of any rivals latched on
through swift splits, got let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat straightened away and was collared a furlong from home,
then weakened in the late stages. OUCH OUCH OUCH hustled from the gate, chased along the inside under motivation from the three-eighths, cut the
corner into upper stretch and weakened. MATTY'S MARAUDER four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, went eight wide at the head of
the stretch and offered no kick.
