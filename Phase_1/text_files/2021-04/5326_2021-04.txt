Footnotes
DEANO chased the frontrunner on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the path nearing the three eighths pole, dueled in upper stretch and
prevailed on the outside in the final furlong. RIPE ATTACK was urged to the lead out of the gate, continued to show the way while saving ground around the
turn, dueled gamely on the rail in upper stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth of a mile, the best of the rest. HELLOFAGUY raced at the back of the
pack early, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground on the outside in late stretch. COME ON DOVER chased the leader on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked while finishing evenly on the rail. R H SMOAKEM raced in the
middle of the pack up the backstretch, began a mild bid from the three path around the turn and flattened out in the final furlong. WILLOW RIDGE trailed the
field the entire way around the oval, saved ground around the turn and was never involved.

Footnotes
NYOMAN reared in the gate shortly before the start but came away without incident, chased midfield early, improved position to track outside of MAGI past
the nine sixteenths, tracked the leader two wide on the turn, edged closer past the five sixteenths, raced into the stretch between horses, drifted out while
driven from upper stretch, nonetheless took the lead from POWER CRY approaching the furlong mark, stayed on under a drive and held STORMY PACIFIC
at bay. The latter was bumped by MAGI in the opening strides, settled toward the rear down the backstretch, came into the turn in the rear flight inside of
SPLASH FOR GOLD, began to rally from the seven sixteenths, tipped three wide near the five sixteenths, was carried out in upper stretch as NYOMAN
drifted out, kept on under a drive while drifting further out late but could not get to NYOMAN. POWER CRY was sent clear, set the pace while saving ground
on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch as NYOMAN and STORMY PACIFIC loomed to his outside, was headed approaching the furlong pole,
weakened but still held safe for the show. MAGI broke in and bumped STORMY PACIFIC in the opening strides, tracked the pace early, settled back to
chase in the four path on the turn, came into the lane in the five path but proved empty for the drive. SPLASH FOR GOLD hit the gate and bobbled at the
break, settled at the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, dropped inside in upper stretch, but had no response when asked.

CLOSE TO ME saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, began a bid passing
the three sixteenths pole and closed quickly on the rail to pull clear in the final furlong. VEGAN GOES BEST opened up a commanding lead from the two
path around the first turn, continued to lead up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, dug in entering the stretch, was caught with a
furlong to go and was second best. BE AUTHENTIC bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far turn in the three path and improved position while drifting in
mildly in the stretch. WOOD NOT MIND raced in the two and three path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, angled in to save ground
the far turn, and gained ground mildly between horses in the final furlong. BODEMAX saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up
the backstretch, began a bid from the rail passing the three eighths pole, improved position in upper stretch and flattened out from there. CHOLLA bumped
with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader from the two path through the opening half mile, began to move up headed into
the far turn, entered the stretch in the two path and then faded. KARA'S ANGEL saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the
inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
HALF OF MANHATTAN tracked the leading pair, raced under a tight hold down the backstretch, was pushed along two wide on the far turn to keep the
leading pair in his sights, swung three wide into the stretch for his rally, loomed through midstretch, led two wide approaching the sixteenth mark and held
sway between horses. RIVER EVANGELIST was off a bit slow and settled second last, raced at the rear of the main group into the backstretch, began to
improve three wide from near the five eighths, pulled into second position near the half mile pole, encroached on the leader in the three path on the far turn,
led near the three sixteenths, was driven to maintain that lead near the furlong mark, could not match HALF OF MANHATTAN from the sixteenth but found
just enough to hold a share of the place inside. TAKE THAT FOR DATA chased two wide through the first turn and into the backstretch, was shuffled back
to the rear of the main group near the five eighths, chased two wide around the far turn, swung six wide to upper stretch, rallied while gradually angling in,
and finished well enough to get up in time for a share of the place. ANGELINO chased in the two path midfield, swung three wide into upper stretch,
responded with a rally between horses when put to a drive, but was narrowly outkicked three wide for the place. CONTRACTION was placed on the lead
inside, set a pressured pace through the first turn and into the backstretch, was headed near the nine sixteenths, and gradually flattened out around the far
turn and after swinging five wide into upper stretch. ZANFORCE prompted the pace two wide through the first turn and while racing keenly down the
backstretch, advanced to lead near the nine sixteenths, set the pace in the two path on the far turn and into the lane, was headed at the three sixteenths
and tailed off inside. HIGH ON SUGAR broke a bit slowly, soon trailed, was pushed along into the far turn, raced in the two path on the far turn, swung into
the lane four wide and went to a drive in upper stretch, and offered no response.

Footnotes
PENALTY SHOT led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, kicked clear
entering the stretch and drew off down the lane. SHOBIZ STAR chased the leader from the two path around the first turn, continued to stalk him up the
backstretch, began a bid from the two path approaching the five sixteenths pole, could not go with the eventual winner and chased that one home, the best
of the rest. MR. LUV MAKER saved ground around the first turn, stalked the frontrunners on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around
the far turn and gained ground mildly on the rail in the stretch. HINTON bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate, raced in the two path around
the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid nearing the quarter
pole and gave way in the final furlong. FORGOT TO FORGET bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the
first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, came around the far turn in the two path and was outkicked from there. SATURDAYS HANGOVER
brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, moved while saving
ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch. YOUNG CORBETT brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first
turn, raced at the back of the pack up the backstretch, began to drop back quickly while saving ground around the far turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
ANGELCENTS was placed on the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, cleared further into the lane, and kept on well clear under a hand ride.
BELLE BREZING chased inside behind the tracking flight, was pushed along from midpack in the two path on the turn, was driven through horses from
upper stretch, and ran on best of the rest while never challenging the winner. SENSE OF SELF settled toward the rear, was pushed along near the five
sixteenths while racing in the two path, swung out six wide in upper stretch, rallied under a drive and got up late for the show. BRUNELLA trailed after
coming slowly into stride, continued patiently in the two path on the turn, was taken six wide into upper stretch and put to a drive, came out even further
approaching midstretch, and made a belated outside rally. GET NONE tracked the pace between horses, proved no match for ANGELCENTS into upper
stretch, and weakened inside of foes in the final furlong. CHROME ATTACK settled toward the rear, continued patiently in the two path on the turn, was
driven inside in upper stretch, and passed tiring horses. TIZ SUSAN ANN tracked the pace three wide early, was urged for a bid into the turn, chased
ANGELCENTS around the bend while racing in the four path, was driven while floating five wide into the lane, but came up empty. WINNAGER chased
three wide down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, swung out and was driven six wide in upper stretch, but lacked the needed rally and
flattened out late. PRETTY SWEET chased between horses, began to lose ground while racing in the three path between horses on the far turn, was driven
four wide in upper stretch, but continued to weaken while drifting out. GET N TIPSY settled in second last down the backstretch, raced in the three to four
path around the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, and offered no bid while drifting in. TIZALADYBUG was hustled up to show pace inside but could
not outsprint ANGELCENTS to the lead, tracked the leader into the turn, chased while saving ground around the bend, was driven in upper stretch, and
emptied out inside foes.

Footnotes
RICHIESGOTSWAGGER brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from
the two path nearing the three eighths pole, dueled in upper stretch and pulled clear while drifting out mildly under a drive. VALIANT VINNY opened up a
two length lead on the field for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, dueled for the lead in upper stretch, was caught and gave way
while drifting out in the final sixteenth of a mile. LOST IN MANHATTAN chased the leaders up the backstretch on the inside, raced in the two path around
the turn and finished evenly while never threatening the top two. BABA LOU raced inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a mild
bid entering the stretch and was outkicked. MEXICO MEMORIES raced off the pace on the inside early, navigated the turn from the two path and passed
tiring horses in the stretch. TALIS PARK GRAD brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the
run up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, swung out entering the stretch, improved position slightly in upper stretch and faded in the
final furlong. TOWN AGENDA trailed the field on the rail up the backstretch and around the turn, gained some ground entering the stretch and was never a
threat. THIRTYMINUTEMASS stalked the leaders on the outside in the opening stages, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn,
and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
FRONTIER CHARLIE soon raced clear on the lead, saved ground through the far turn, floated out into the four path in upper stretch, came in midstretch as
HE'S RECKLESS encroached to his inside, was quickly corrected by his rider, drove clear of HE'S RECKLESS inside the furlong marker, and narrowly held.
ZARMAE settled toward the rear of the main group, began to improve inside of horses down the backstretch, sustained that rally in the three path on the far
turn, angled out five wide for the drive, kept finding while all out and gained on the leader to the wire. HE'S RECKLESS tracked the pace two wide,
continued to stalk in the two path on the far turn, was driven for a rally inside of FRONTIER CHARLIE in upper stretch, steadied when put in tight near the
furlong mark, but nonetheless kept on willingly for the show. MAGA COUNTRY chased inside of MANGO TREE, was pushed along in the two path on the
far turn close behind the leading pair, went to a drive in upper stretch but was no match for the leading pair there, nonetheless continued to give chase
under a drive while drifting out, took slightly closer order late but was outfinished. MIKE'S LADY settled at the rear of the main group inside of LORD
BOLSTON, took closer order inside into the far turn, raced in the two path toward the rear around that bend, was driven inside in upper stretch and offered a
bid, but evened out in the final furlong. WAR TRAIL chased midpack early, raced between horses toward the rear into the far turn as other horses started to
make their runs, was urged in the five path around that bend, and driven between horses in upper stretch, and passed tiring horses. MANGO TREE floated
six wide into the clubhouse turn, chased outside of MAGA COUNTRY into the backstretch, began to flatten out from the half mile mark, raced in the four
path around the far turn, floated into the stretch in the six path, and continued his gradual fade. A HINT OF GRAY hopped at the break, soon trailed, took
closer order down the backstretch while still bringing up the rear, raced at the rear in the two path on the far turn, was driven inside into the lane but lacked
the needed rally. LORD BOLSTON hit the gate and was awkwardly away, raced keenly while floating five wide into the first turn, settled outside of MIKE'S
LADY at the rear of the main pack, raced three wide into the far turn, and emptied out in the six path around the bend. EL LAY tracked the leader outside of
HE'S RECKLESS for the first half mile, stopped, faded in the five path around the far turn and was allowed to trail home. BOTH THE JOCKEY AND
TRAINER OF HE'S RECKLESS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF FRONTIER CHARLIE, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.
UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.
