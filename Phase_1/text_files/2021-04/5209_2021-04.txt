THE GREATEST EAGLE stalked the pace along the inside into the far turn, made the lead, set the balance of the pace, drifted to the middle of the racetrack
and drew off under right handed urging. MUTADARRIB never far back, offered a bid in the middle of the racetrack into the stretch and finished clear for
second. PRINCE AMADEUS broke in front, set the pace into the far turn then weakened. DR CHAPPELL offered a mild bid along the inside into the stretch
then failed to sustain that bid. DERBY MODEL was outrun. RESTITUTION pressed the pace into the far turn then stopped.

EXPRESS BOY prompted the pace along the rail into the stretch, was bumped hard while making the lead a furlong out knocking him off stride, dug in
determinedly and proved best in a game effort. IDOWHATIDO made the lead on the four path on the first turn, set a pressured pace two wide, edged clear
on the second turn , drifted to the five path entering the stretch, ducked in when struck with a right handed whip bumping hard with the winner at the eighth
pole then was outfinished. TRUENO stalked the pace from the inside for six furlongs, altered course to the five path entering the stretch and was steadily
gaining ground late. BREVET OFFICER bumped at the start, gained rapidly in the three path into the stretch then came up empty. THE DRAKE failed to
respond. ROBERTOS TICKET bumped at the start then failed to menace. GOLDENPENCE with the second flight two then three wide, inched closer on the
far turn then flattened out. FAST FAIRY had speed along the inside for six furlongs then wilted. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT
TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
LARSA made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best under a strong hand ride. DE BOLT
LIGHT chased the winner and finished well clear for second. GLORIOUS GLITTER allowed to settle, passed tiring rivals late. CONCORDSDIFFERENCE
had speed from the start, inched closer along the inside nearing the turn then came up empty. I GOT HOPE stalked the early pace and was through after a
half. GOOSEISONTHELOOSE had brief speed. KITTEN'STINKINRICH was no threat. VOLUME BY DAISY was outrun. MYSTIC MAGIC was no factor.
PERFECT ILLUSION was through early.
