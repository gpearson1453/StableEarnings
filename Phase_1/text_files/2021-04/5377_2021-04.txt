Footnotes
MR. MAZZA vied outside EXTRACTION WILL for six furlongs, took over turning for home and was all out to stay clear. SOCIAL EQUALITY saved ground
early near the back, swung four wide rallying off the far turn, and finished well to best the others. KOLOHE PRINCE tracked the pace four then three wide
on the turns, lacked a closing bid and just saved the show. MAXI MOON saved ground in range early, moved out two then three wide on the far turn, and
had only a mild response just missing the show. EXTRACTION WILL contested the pace inside MR. MAZZA for six furlongs, and gave way. GEOMETRICO
raced in the second flight, and drifted out late. GRAN PATRON was strung out five wide on the first turn, and was through early. COLLIERY broke slowly,
was outrun for six furlongs, and stopped.

ALEJANDRO'S TEAM settled off the pace while racing three wide, came four wide into the lane, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. NEW YORK
STYLE dueled outside of RALSTON past the sixteenth pole, won that battle but was caught in the final strides. OMEGA MOON stalked the duel three wide
and was one-paced through the lane. RALSTON dueled inside past the eighth pole and weakened. HANDSOME PRINCE tracked the pace inside and came
up empty in the lane. CHIPSHAPE lunged at the start, lost contact early, was eased and jogged across the finish line. ENANO ASTRAY stopped, was pulled
up in the stretch and walked off.

BABY BOOMER set the pace inside, shook off a trio of pursuers around the turn, kicked clear through upper stretch, then held off TROPICAT under a
steady drive. TROPICAT was outsprinted early, shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, finished with good energy but could not seriously menace the
top one. BELGRANO pressed the pace between horses three then two wide, got shaken off leaving the turn and weakened. KOBE FIFTY TWO was outrun
near the inside. LEGAL DEAL pursued outside the early leaders four wide, got outpaced around the turn and gave way. MONTE NE pressed the pace two
wide between horses, and dropped out of it after three furlongs.

Footnotes
FRANKIE'S GIRL was bumped at the start, saved ground well back, swung six wide in upper stretch, closed down the center of the track and was up and
clear in deep stretch. FOXTROT SEVILLE settled two wide in midpack, rallied between foes through the stretch and gained the place late. TWIRLING
GRACE stalked the pace from the rail, took the lead inside of the pacesetter nearing the sixteenth pole but was outkicked from there. CARELESS HEIRESS
was bumped between foes at the start, raced off the pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, bid between foes nearing the sixteenth pole
but was outfinished. ALEXANDRA AM I set the pace in the two path, led past the eighth pole then weakened. IRAZU was bumped at the start, saved ground
in midpack, made progress nearing the lane but lacked room through most of the stretch. LOOK WHAT I FOUND prompted the pace in the three path,
continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. LUCY'S CAKES FLY hit the starting gate to get away well last, raced two wide and never threatened. SHE'S
SO SERIOUS chased the pace four wide and retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
BETWEEN DREAMS was a step slow to begin, hustled through between horses to stay close early, shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, rallied
steadily and drew clear through the last 70 yards. QUEEN ABARRIO saved ground early in striking range, switched out three wide at the head of the
stretch, bid between horses and had enough to get the place in a three-way photo. PINK FIZZ broke a step slowly and was outrun early inside, moved out
five wide late on the turn, rallied on the far outside and just missed second. DANCING DESTROYER vied for command outside LYRICAL to the stretch, and
weakened through the last eighth of a mile. LYRICAL dueled inside DANCING DESTROYER from the start to midstretch, and gave way.
TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE raced two wide and lacked the needed response. NOBLE MARIA was no factor three wide. MYSTIC COMIN HOME was a step
slow at the start, and showed little at the back. GO GATOR GIRL GO tired four wide around the turn.

drove clear. SALUTE THE COLONEL sped to the front, objected vociferously to rating tactics around the first turn, was allowed to clear nearing the
clubhouse turn, settled down while setting a clear pace inside from there, repulsed a bid from BASHA midway around the far turn, got out badly from the
quarter pole, straightened out in the ten path in midstretch and stayed on willingly to regain second late. BASHA set the early pace in the two path, settled
into a clear stalking position nearing the clubhouse turn, bid two wide near the five-sixteenths pole, inherited the lead in upper stretch when SALUTE THE
COLONEL got out but was outfinished. PLEASECALLMEBACK was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled out near the quarter pole and
had a mild gain. COWTOWN failed to menace while racing three wide. GO POKE THE BEAR was bumped at the start, saved ground well back, angled out
nearing the lane and never threatened. MR TITO'S raced three wide in midpack early, saved ground around the far turn and faded in the lane. RUN-UP

Footnotes
MUSTANG CAT came away alertly, rated along on a measured lead inside, shook off bids from TAAMER and DEVOTED KITTEN around the turn, and dug
in to keep TRAPPEZOID at a safe distance through the stretch. TRAPPEZOID stumbled badly at the start, recovered to stay in range up the backstretch,
moved menacingly four wide around the turn, could not get to the winner through the lane but was clearly second best. DEVOTED KITTEN pressed the
pace three wide, got shaken off after six furlongs, and ran on to secure the show. PLEASE SIT DOWN raced three to four wide around the turn, and could
not reach contention. TEXTPECTATION saved ground to no avail. AYCAPOTE saved ground to the turn, and moved out three wide fading near the
quarter-pole. TAAMER pressed the pace outside MUSTANG CAT, was under a drive between horses by the five-sixteenths, and came up empty.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL MISSION raced off the pace three wide, swung six wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. OUTSHINE advanced
two wide around the first turn to the lead, cleared and angled in early on the backstretch, set a clear pace from there and led until deep stretch. TIMMY M.
was strung out five wide entering the first turn, angled in midway around the bend, ran up on heels late on the turn, raced two wide between foes in midpack
from there and rallied between rivals to gain the show. DUROCHER lagged well back inside, swung out near the eighth pole and rallied belatedly.
PROLIFERATE saved ground in range and lacked the needed rally. GOLDEN DECISION settled off the early pace two wide, made progress down the
backstretch, went four wide around the far turn, remained in contention between foes to midstretch then tired. FIG JELLY led early, stalked two wide and
came up empty in the lane. GEMONTEER tracked the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. PIONEER MAN was washy pre-race and failed to menace
while racing three wide. GO MIKE was fractious in the gate and outrun inside.

Footnotes
MISS LAMARR dueled inside BAHAMIAN RHAPSODY from the start, and edged clear through the last 70 yards. BAHAMIAN RHAPSODY broke out and
took the worst of a bump with FLAT OUT COOL, recovered to vie outside MISS LAMARR, and was bested through the late stages. LA DAME raced two
wide off the battling leaders around the turn, and could not gain through the stretch on her left lead. ART ROCK walked out of the gate, lacked room toward
the inside entering the turn, moved out four wide past the quarter-pole, and improved mildly for the last major share. WINNIPEG WONDER saved ground
around the turn, and had no rally. SASSY CAT raced three wide around the turn, and faded through the drive. FLAT OUT COOL bumped with BAHAMIAN
RHAPSODY at the start, and was outrun in the two-path. CIDSTAYINURLAINE brushed the left side of the gate and was slow into stride, was floated out
five or six wide outside SILVER PACKAGE midway on the turn, and made no headway. EMPEROR'S SONG was four wide early in range, got out six or
seven wide midway on the turn, and tired. SILVER PACKAGE was four to five wide entering the turn at the back, and remained outrun.
