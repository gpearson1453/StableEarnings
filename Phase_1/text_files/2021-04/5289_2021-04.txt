Footnotes
ARROWWOOD rated just off the pace and off the rail, challenged nearing the five sixteenths pole and dueled to the front two deep midway on the far turn,
then dug in under determined handling to inch clear. CASTLE REVIEW stalked inside the first turn then rated close through the backstretch, started a bid
leaving the quarter pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, angled three wide into the stretch and dug in to take second the final strides. ELLIES LIL
CASTLE closed to the front nearing the three quarter pole and rated a slim lead two deep, came under pressure past the five sixteenths pole and contested
at the rail into the far turn, gave up the nod midway through the turn but continued gamely close to mid-stretch before relenting. TIZBIT raced in the three
path the first turn and settled just off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, though, faded in the four path of the
far turn. SONDE AFFAIR angled to the inside early then eased out with a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but showed little response.

final yards. TUESDAY'S ROSE steadied on the chute then angled to the outside to give early chase, raced just off the rail on the turn, angled to the five path
into the lane then closed steadily to take third the final strides. INDIAN FIBER set a pressured early pace but was headed toward the five sixteenths pole,
continued close between horses on the turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. GLORIOUS MYSTERY chased toward the outside, raced in the five

PARTY LIFE closed to the front while angling to the inside and rated the pace, was given rein leaving the three eighths pole, came under urging at the
quarter pole, steadily widened through the turn and proved much the best. JUST NOD AND SMILE saved ground well off the early pace, bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the five path, but drifted wider into the stretch and proved no match. SCOTTISH MAN raced well back
saving early ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was carried to the six path approaching the top of the lane and raced evenly to late stretch.
BABY WHITE SOX broke a bit awkwardly, though sharply, and settled close, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened in the three path of
the far turn. BLACK STEEL raced just off the pace about the three path the first turn, though, faded past the three eighths pole. BUSCH LATTE raced well
off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
ENGLISH HONOR broke outward then surged to the lead and angled in to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, widened at
the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled down the lane. BRANANX stalked off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the
rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on for second. ORIENTATED rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths then bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the five path and was along for third inside the sixteenth pole. DON CICCIO steadied lightly at the
break then saved early ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little further.
DUNLUCE CAISSLE rounded the opening turn about the six path and raced well back into the backstretch, rounded the far turn off the rail then lost ground
nearing the top of the stretch. HOLY BOLY broke out to make contact with FOR ARTS SAKE then rated just off the early pace inside, picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn, while the latter, was jostled at the break and raced well back. CLUTCH PLAYER raced
well off the pace and showed little response down the backstretch. RHYTHM GUITAR broke in to make contact with For Arts Sake, raced outside into the
backstretch, was eased nearing the five sixteenths pole, though, walked off post race. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of English
Honor, lodged by the rider of Don Ciccio, for an alleged infraction at the start, though, found insufficient reason for change.

pole, came through the far turn still about the five path, dug in to take third later yards and raced clear nearing the wire. REATA'S CASTLE stalked into the
backstretch then challenged toward the three eighths pole, dueled to a slim brief lead inside the sixteenth pole but was caught later yards. CHAMPAGNE
JAM raced well off the pace in the four and five paths the opening turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the five path of the far turn, drifted
into the lane but steadily improved to take third the final strides. BULL MEECHUM angled in and raced with the early pace then took the nod past the nine
sixteenths pole, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, drew clear at the quarter but was met into the stretch, continued at even terms through the
upper stretch then weakened the final sixteenth. LET'S GET STARTED saved early ground, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced
two deep on the far turn and showed little further. STRINGFELLA rounded the opening turn in the four and five paths then stalked four wide into the
backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, but faded on the far turn. MR. SNAP raced with the pace inside then stalked past the nine
sixteenths pole, gave chase through the backstretch but faded past the five sixteenths. EXECUTIVE PRIZE raced well off the pace. ISLAND CADGER
steadied between horses approaching the opening turn, raced in the four path through the turn but showed little.

Footnotes
EARNED THE SHOT saved ground off the pace the first turn, angled out with a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, progressed in the four path of the far
turn and dug in under steady stretch encouragement to get up the final strides. UNCUT raced with the early pace inside then stalked into the opening turn,
took over approaching the seven sixteenths pole and was pressured from the three eighths to turn back Polished Copper, dug in under a steady drive
leaving the far turn but was caught in the final strides. BIRD TRAFFIC settled off the pace two deep the opening turn, bid with the winner leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and raced in the six path of the far turn, entered the stretch widest and finished well to get third inside the sixteenth pole. ADIOS HILLARY
raced in the three path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the five path and ran evenly down the lane.
DAH PHILLY saved ground the first turn and was well off the pace into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail
but flattened stride the final furlong. POLISHED COPPER rated close off the rail the first turn then stalked three wide into the backstretch, bid toward the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then weakened. PUT POSITION settled off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn, entered the
backstretch outside, bid toward the three eighths pole and ran in the four path of the far turn, though showed little more. SHALL WE DANCE was not a
factor. SOLID AS A ROCK raced with the early pace two deep and took the nod at the five eighths pole, was caught toward the seven sixteenths and faded
readily.
