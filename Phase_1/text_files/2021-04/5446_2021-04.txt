MUSICAL MILLIE pressed the pace four wide through the opening turn, was well rated in a tightly bunched pack nearing the half pole, trekked three wide
through the second bend, then shook clear of all rivals in final furlong. A FAST BROAD led the field from outset while saving ground, relished command
near the half pole, lacked room inside midway through the bend, swung wide at upper stretch and rallied back for the place honors. SUNDAY'S VISION
failed to sustain bid after stalking the front runners from a three path pose. KEENA hustled from outset to exchange command through the opening half,
trekked the two path at the conclusion of the backstretch, then faded in closing strides. SISTER KITTEN trailed the field from outset and saved ground the
entire way.

U S HERO broke alertly and shared command with OTSEGO along the backstretch, maintained an inside stance through the turn, and kicked clear in the
homestretch. WEST COAST BROKER was unhurried in opening stages, circled rivals five wide through the turn nearing the quarter pole, was five wide at
upper stretch and earned the place with a late charge while gaining on the leader at finish. WRITTEN PERMISSION showed reserve through the opening
half, swung wide at upper stretch and rallied mid track for the show while finishing full of run. ETTERBAY UCKLAY lacked a closing kick after pressing three
wide at conclusion of backstretch and swinging to four wide at upper stretch. RUNFORUSRUN disputed the early pace froma three wide pose then tired in
the crucial portion of contest. OTSEGO flashed early speed and exchanged command through the opening half from a two path stance but faded in the
homestretch. RED FLASH failed to menace while trailing the field from outset.

RIVER RULER established a two path stance and shared the command through the opening half, was given the cue for more run through the final bend and
inched away in final furlong. ABSAROKA rushed from outset and secured a ground saving stance while exchanging command with RIVER RULER, had the
slightest of leads at upper stretch but was unable to match strides with that rival in the closing strides. SHANGHAI SKIPPER settled along the inside in the
second flight and was closing fast at the finish. CLIFTON PARK failed to threaten while giving chase from a two path pose. DAK DA MAN trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GOSPEL MARGIE talked the frontrunner through the opening half from a three path pose, awaited options along the backstretch, maintained that line past
the quarter pole and wore down the leader in final furlong for the score. MARKANTONY'SQUEEN was unhurried through the first turn, advanced along the
rail under urging just inside the half pole and through the second bend, led the field at the eighth pole and was caught in final strides. YOLONDA settled into
the second flight for the opening half, angled out through the far turn and was widest of all at upper stretch before earning the show with a god late run.
OLIVE COUNTY rushed from outset but lacked room and was squeezed back entering the first turn, gave chase from a two path pose and lacked a closing
rally. ARKANSAS INVASION menaced mildly while gviing chase from a wide rated position. JOLLYVILLE loomed the pacesetting duo while trekking the
four path through the opening half, then steadily retreated in the crucial stages. CLASSICAL HOTTIE hustled from outset and set the pace through the
opening half before eclipsing in the late going.

Footnotes
GOSPEL TIZ JOY ws unhurried along the backstretch, hugged the inside through the bend and rallied strongly along the rail for the score. TAYLOR'S
VISION rated mid pack for the opening half, trekked the three path through the turn, split rivals at the eighth pole with the best stride late to earn place.
RIVER RUBY pressed the pace along the backstretch, was close up at the quarter pole and four wide entering the homestretch, and finished grudgingly to
hold the show. MISS COFFEYVILLE pressed the pace three wide, had a slight advantage over the field nearing the eighth pole but couldnt fend off the late
charging rivals in final furlong. SATIN FINISH broke alertly and established a ground saving stance, was given the cue nearing the five sixteenths pole, then
angled out in the homestretch but was unable to match strides with rivals in final sixteenth. MINI MAGS gave chase while travelling the two path and had no
response to urging in the crucial portion of contest. SHEMINE FELINE flashed early foot and led all rivals through the opening half but quickly faded in late
going. GOTTA ROLL settled into mid pack, closed the gap on the front runners mid turn, then tired in the final furlong. FAST EMMA J menaced mildly from a
back rated pose. VALENTINA LIL failed to threaten while trailing the field.
