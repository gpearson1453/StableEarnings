Footnotes
MY FUNNY GAL was reserved just off the leaders early, advanced five-wide through the turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths pole and quickly
drew off. CALL YOUR BLUFF bobbled at the start, quickly recovered to alternate for the early lead, moved four-wide through the turn, could not match
strides with the winner but held on for the place. TOMORROW'S MINE pressed the pace from between rivals, dropped back nearing the half, angled out into
the stretch and finished with good late energy. TIZ SIMPLY AWESOME was forwardly placed from off the rail and weakened after going a half. ME FIRST
alternated for the early lead while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. DOLLIYS GOLD was off a step slow, lagged far back early, moved
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TILLTHELUVRUNSOUT alternated for the early lead and weakened after a half.

Footnotes
ICE POP dueled for the lead with BELLA'S BACK while racing four-wide, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear margin into the lane and
drew off with complete authority. DELIGHTFUL HIPS settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy to
gain the place. BELLA'S BACK disputed the pace with the winner from off the rail and gave way to that foe after going a half. JAMAICAN CENTS was off a
step slow, raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished willingly. HIT IT TWICE showed no early speed, raced six-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. BRITE LILY was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not threaten. CELEE'S TE lacked early
speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM pressed the pace of NO HARBOR IN SIGHT while racing four-wide, moved up to gain command nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
opened a clear lead and held sway to the wire. WE'RE JUST SAYIN lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, could not reach the
winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. LIFELINE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and
finished with good courage. BOB'S ALL IN settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. NO
HARBOR IN SIGHT was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. CHECK AND RAISE
showed no early speed, raced seven-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. INCREDIBLE LUCK chased the leaders while racing five-wide and
weakened after going a half. Due to to a timer malfunction the half time is unavailable.

REDACTION lagged early, raced eight-wide through the turn, wore down ROBIN'S LEGACY in the closing yards despite losing whip and was going away
late. ROBIN'S LEGACY stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole, gained command with a furlong to run,
opened a clear margin but could not match strides with the winner late. EXILED pressed the pace while racing five-wide, drifted out nearing the quarter,
responded to steady urging and finished willingly. MONTANA JACK settled off the leaders early, reached a striking position into the stretch but lacked the
needed late response. SIR LAUGHALOT bobbled at the start, pressed the pace while racing six-wide, was carried out further nearing the quarter and
finished evenly late. EL DORADO STORM raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and failed to rally.
TIGER'S SONG set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, drifted out into the lane and gave way through the final furlong. REBEL ROAR was void of
early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SEMI SWEET raced unhurried early, advanced seven-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew off. KILLARNEY
LASS stalked the pace of SHANGHAI KEELY while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths marker, opened a clear lead
with a quarter to run but could not resist the winner late. SENORADIABLO was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled in
nearing three-sixteenths pole and finished willingly. WISE RACHEL settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and did not
menace. MONGOLIAN LOTUS raced four-wide through the first turn, was forwardly placed, moved five-wide through the second turn and weakened in the
drive. SHANGHAI KEELY sprinted clear at once, appeared hard to rate, angled out nearing the quarter while retreating and continued to weaken in the
drive.

REDHAWK was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths pole and quickly drew
off. MERRY MARIE stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, could not match strides with the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly second
best. DADDY HEAT was off a step slow, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished with a late bid.
FULLY COMPLIANT was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished a belated bid. DR. MINISTER settled off the leaders from
between foes, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. OLD WEST dueled for the lead while racing four-wide and gave way through the final
furlong. COUNTRY CLASSIC raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and did not menace. SOUTHSIDE CAROLINE disputed
the pace while racing three-wide and gradually weakened. PARKERS BLACK LADY showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not

CHIEFTAIN'S LAD was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with WED O'S CHAMP while racing four-wide, disposed of that rival after going
five furlongs, was taken on by TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT soon after, vied with that foe and edged away through the closing yards. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT raced
five-wide through the first run, settled off the leaders early, moved up five-wide to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths marker, vied with the winner but could
not get by that foe in the drive. JU JU GUY raced five-wide through the first turn, was positioned just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the
second turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. NONNO'S POLARIS was off a step slow, raced off the leaders from between foes and
finished evenly late. BLUES RAPPER showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. ESTEEMED lacked early foot,
raced ten-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. JAMASON raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to
rally. THAT DOG WILL HUNT showed brief speed and weakened. WED O'S CHAMP dueled for the lead while racing three-wide and weakened after going
five furlongs. RI' PIN SNAP was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened in the drive. Due to to a timer malfunction
the half time is unavailable.

Footnotes
GONE QUICK dueled for the lead while racing three-wide while between rivals, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with little need of urging.
ALWAYS FOR MONEY settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. COPPER WINGS was off slow,
lagged early, raced six-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished evenly late. WATCHFUL EYE was forwardly placed early, moved
five-wide through the turn and failed to gain late. TIME TO BEE QUICK dueled for the lead while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong.
GOLDSHAFT lacked early foot, raced seven-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BAINE THE BULL was void of early speed, raced three-wide
through the turn and did not menace. HAYNESPUN disputed the pace from the inside for a half and weakened. FAITHMEISTER raced off the pacesetters
early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.
