WORKIN ON A DREAM took command heading to the first turn, set a rated pace towards the rail, kept challengers at bay leaving the far turn, lost command
past the three sixteenths but did not give in, stayed on to battle under stout left handed asking, regained the lead inside the sixteenth marker and was
resolute to the line. HANALEI'S HOUDINI settled in the clear while not far back, angled out leaving the half mile marker, circled four wide making progress
into the lane, took over past the three sixteenths, dueled outside the winner through the final furlong but wasn't quite good enough. AWESOME D J , off the
pace while saving ground, angled out mid way on the final turn and churned on with some interest. WEATHER WIZ lacked speed, raced two to three wide
into the lane, angled out but lacked a solid kick. PRINCE JAMES , a bit rank early on, tracked three wide into the far turn, was under urging pursuing past
the five sixteenths, failed to keep pace into the lane, shifted in and faded. TATTOOED lacked speed and was taken outside early, lost ground four wide mid
way through the backstretch run and failed to respond. LADDIE LIAM prompted the pace two wide, tried to go after the winner leaving the far turn, was
under a hearty ride pursuing past the five sixteenths and faltered.

Footnotes
EXTRA MEDIUM hugged the inner rail around the turn, angled to the two path in upper stretch, closed inside horses and was up late. COBH chased the
pace, gained a short lead between horses in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. BOURBON STREET stalked the pace, circled the turn four deep, bid for
the lead in mid stretch and hung. START WITH YES , steadied in close quarters near the four and half furlongs pole, remained inside horses in the stretch
and rallied late. BLUE DANUBE sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and weakened. MYSTIC TIMES raced in the two path around the
turn and failed to rally. KEEPING THE PEACE was no factor. PROUD ENOUGH , wide on the turn, was not a factor. TOM TERRIFIC raced in the three path
between horses on the turn and gave way. SUPER BUDDY trailed.

Footnotes
XANTHIQUE , a bit headstrong while saving ground nearing the five eighths, steadied briefly off heels leaving the far turn, regrouped and pulled her way
forward to follow CRYSTAL CLIFFS (FR) with an inside run into the lane, eased out for room past mid stretch, closed relentlessly under right handed asking,
drew alongside in deep stretch then put a nose in front in the final jumps to narrowly prove best. CRYSTAL CLIFFS (FR) , taken to rate while saving ground,
took closer order leaving the far turn, responded when asked and moved through along the inside entering the lane, took over inside rivals soon after,
spurted clear under a drive in mid stretch, dug in when collared past the sixteenth marker, dueled late and just missed in valiant effort. VIGILANTES WAY
relaxed three wide a a forward position, took up chase past the three eighths, ranged up four wide approaching the stretch, battled for command soon into
the lane but failed to match strides in the final furlong. ELEGANT DE DOMINO vied outside LAGOM early on, moved clear through the backstretch and set
the pace, entered the lane two wide while engaged from both sides, stayed willingly another sixteenth then gave way. FED UP FIRED UP , off the pace
while saving ground, eased out in mid stretch but lacked a solid kick. LAGOM vied inside through the opening quarter, rated back to stalk, came back three
wide under a ride past the five sixteenths, chased between foes into the stretch then gave way. DON'T BLAME JUDY , three wide, gave way. YLIKEDIS
settled off the pace, raced two wide into the lane but failed to menace. FIONNBHARR was outrun.

Footnotes
LAKI broke alertly, chased the pace while in the two path around the turn, eased out at the head of the lane, drifted out inside the three sixteenths pole,
closed outside the leader and overtook that one in mid stretch then was kept under urging in the drive. LEBDA , sent to the early lead, set the pace along
the inner rail, was challenged in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. EASTERN BAY , unhurried down the backstretch, circled rivals on the turn, was four
deep entering the stretch and offered a slight rally. ARTHUR'S HOPE , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, raced on his left lead in the drive and
weakened. ABSENTEE raced in the two path between horses on the turn and was never a factor. PRESS MY BETS lacked speed, raced between horses in
the stretch and passed tired ones. FACTOR IT IN stumbled when appearing to clip the heels of WHERESHETOLDMETOGO near the five eighths pole then
failed to menace. SILENT MALICE was outrun. WHERESHETOLDMETOGO had his heels clipped when he came in in front of FACTOR IT IN near the five
eighths, hugged the inner rail, gave way in mid stretch and was eased late. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run down the backstretch but no
action was taken.

Footnotes
CORELLI , unhurried early while saving ground, eased out while edging closer past the five sixteenths, shifted out five wide into the lane, rolled up and
joined PIXELATE from his outside with a sixteenth to go, dueled under a drive, gained a slim lead late, and narrowly prevailed. PIXELATE was lightly
steadied while saving ground mid way on the first turn, angled out and stalked three wide, responded and advanced four wide to engage the dueling leaders
into the lane, gained command under a drive soon past the three sixteenths, dug in when confronted by CORELLI with a sixteenth remaining, battled nose
to nose and just missed in a sharp effort. DREAMS OF TOMORROW was taken back off the lead soon after the break, settled outside a rival, swung six
wide for the drive, moved up past mid stretch and kept on willingly. EONS found himself well back heading to the first turn while saving ground, picked up
some momentum past the three eighths and advanced along the inside into the lane, eased out, split foes past the sixteenth marker and finished with good
energy. NINETY ONE ASSAULT , taken to rate in about the two path, moved outside foes leaving the far turn, advanced in mid stretch but failed to seriously
sustain. DOC BOY , off the rail, dropped back some leaving the far turn, waited briefly nearing the lane, gained between rivals nearing the sixteenth pole
then flattened out. BALLAGH ROCKS prompted the pace outside PAPAL LAW, drew alongside after a half mile, dueled on near even terms into the lane,
gained a slim lead soon after, kept on willingly to the sixteenth pole then gave way. PAPAL LAW went clear early, set the pace towards the rail, dueled into
the lane then faltered through the final furlong. DINAR steadied off the leaders into the first turn, saved ground stalking the pace for nearly six furlongs then
gave way.

MISS LESLIE , squeezed back after she hopped at the break, steadied in tight quarters along the inner rail entering the first turn, rated well behind rivals
down the backstretch, began to pick up momentum on the far turn, swung to the five path for clear sailing turning for home, closed nicely outside foes, led
late and drove clear. OLIVIAOFTHEDESERT , along the inner rail around both turns, eased off the rail approaching the eighth pole, challenged for the lead
between horses approaching the sixteenth pole and finished gamely. LITTLESTITIOUS , in the two path the first turn, lightly bumped with HYBRID ECLIPSE
near the three eighths pole, had a mild four wide move leaving the far turn, was well positioned in upper stretch and flattened out. EXOGEN , three wide the
first turn, chased the pace down the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn, remained prominent to the eighth pole then weakened.
MOONSAFE came out leaving the starting gate, sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and tired in the drive. HYBRID ECLIPSE , two wide the
first turn, stalked the pace, bumped with LITTLESTITIOUS near the three eighths pole and gave way.

Footnotes
EXCELLORATOR , keen behind the leaders while saving ground past the seven eighths, stalked towards the inside past the five eighths, eased out and
gave hard chase as a duel developed past the three furlong marker, ranged up four wide and took command near the three sixteenths, kicked clear, came
out after being roused left handed in mid stretch, corrected with right handed asking, dug in when meeting an outside bid from THE REDS and grimly
prevailed. THE REDS , sluggish from the gate, was shaken up soon after and edged up off the rail, steadied when rank from the seven eighths to the three
quarter pole, worked between rivals while under a ride leaving the far turn angled out and advanced five wide into the stretch, ranged up then was floated
out by EXCELLORATOR soon past the eighth pole, shifted in some to battle through the final sixteenth but just missed. ROYAL NUMBER settled off the
pace, angled out leaving the far turn, circled six wide making a run into the lane, ranged up in mid stretch, lost momentum when carried out soon after,
recovered and churned on with some interest. HELLO HOT ROD , taken to rate while saving ground, gained towards the rail past the five sixteenths, eased
out continuing progress near mid stretch but failed to seriously sustain. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU prompted the pace outside SHACKLED LOVE, moved
alongside leaving the far turn, dueled to upper stretch, drifted in some near mid stretch and weakened. SHACKLED LOVE gained clear advantage into the
first turn, set the pace towards the rail, got engaged in a duel from the far turn to about the three sixteenths, steadied briefly when MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU
drifted in then gave way. ZERTZ stalked the early pace off the rail, was under asking three wide leaving the far turn and tired. TIZ MANDATE hesitated at
the break, lagged well back, failed to respond around the final turn, was eased late and walked off. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the rider
of THE REDS, EXCELLORATOR was disqualified and placed second for causing interference in the stretch. Objections against EXCELLORATOR and THE
REDS by the rider of ROYAL NUMBER claiming alleged interference in the stretch were not allowed.

Footnotes
COMPLETED PASS broke well, stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up three wide on the turn, took a short lead in upper stretch, responded to
urging and was edging clear at the finish. FRANCATELLI broke alertly and quickly sprinted clear, set the pace in the two path around the turn, lost the
advantage in upper stretch and dug in tenaciously in the drive. FAIR CATCH hugged the inner rail, chased the pace and faded. LOVE YOU MUCH raced in
the two path between horses turning for home and finished evenly. ROBEY'S BOY raced between horses throughout and failed to menace. DENDROBIA ,
wide, was not a facor. BLESSED ARION was no factor. SO STREET was not a factor. NEWSTOME had a mild three wide move between horses leaving
the turn then weakened. WILLISTON WAY , wide, weakened.
