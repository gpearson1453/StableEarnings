SEAHORSE D'ORO five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn and advanced coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took over command and swung three wide for home, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone late threat and held on
to prevail. LEMON TAFFY coaxed from the gate, chased four wide until tucked to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun three wide for home and offered up a mild kick to threaten through the final sixteenth but was ultimately repelled. CALIDAD chased four then three
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and stayed on one paced through to the finish. SCOTT ALAIA coaxed from the start,
raced forwardly placed just off the inside before fading through the turn put to coaxing midway, angled out six wide into upper stretch and came again to
pass tired foes through to the finish. QUIET TYPE chased just off the inside until tucked inside five furlongs from home, got coaxed along at the
seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. HEY RED five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. IDAKA established the front and showed the way lightly coaxed three paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to be along the inside through the turn coming under urging at the three-eighths, came under pressure and yielded the front near the
quarter pole, spun just off the inside at that station into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
NO LIME bumped soundly with a foe at the start but recovered quickly then strolled to the front, was well rated while setting an uncontested pace off the
inside, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, powered away under a left-handed whip into the final
sixteenth then was eased up in the final strides while much the best. ICY DUDE brushed with a rival at the start while hustled, settled under some urging,
came under stronger encouragement midway down the backstretch, moved from the inside to the three path on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch,
moved into second under a left-handed crop into the final furlong, drifted out some outside the sixteenth-pole then was switched to a right-handed crop and
finished willingly for the place while no match for the winner. TRAPPEZE ARTIST settled on the outside, moved closer under urging while four wide on the
turn, was driven into upper stretch and came up empty while best of the rest. BETA moved out under tight restraint early, stalked the pace on the outside,
was given his cue in the three path on the turn, chased into upper stretch and tired. FOTIS brushed with a foe at the start, was coaxed along off the pace,
went two to three wide under stronger encouragement on the turn and failed to respond. KINGFISH broke out and bumped soundly with a rival, settled at
the rear, went three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
YEROSILVERBIZ prompted the pace from the outside three then two wide advancing to take command near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper
stretch set down for the drive, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held on to prevail. WARFRONT FIGHTER coaxed from the gate,
chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to threaten late but was
ultimately staved off. MISTER J T bobbled at the break, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. SINASHACK broke in at the start and was corrected, showed the way in
hand along the inside under some pressure from YEROSILVERBIZ to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got displaced from command
near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. JAILBREAKER chased four to five wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths and trailed.

Footnotes
SCILLY CAY tracked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, chased four wide into the stretch,
gained alongside the runner-up to make a bid coming to the furlong marker, battled with two foes into the final sixteenth, dueled while drifting in a bit late
and gamely prevailed. BRONX BOMBER brushed with a foe just after the start, settled nicely off the pace, was asked while inside to the two path on the
turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, closed well on the inside of the winner to make a bid approaching the furlong marker, fought with two opponents into
the final sixteenth then dueled with the winner while drifting in a bit late and was denied but clear for the place. STEAM ENGINE brushed with a foe just after
the start, was well rated while setting a clear pace, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, was asked after straightening into the stretch then came
under a drive, led into the final furlong then was headed by the top two, battled into the final sixteenth then was out-kicked while clear for the show. DARK
MONEY brushed with foes just after the start then was grabbed with the left-rein, settled under some urging, went five wide under stronger encouragement
on the turn and came up empty. BEARS MAFIA was urged along at the rear, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. SEVEN LILIES
settled outside under some urging, came under stronger encouragement while four wide on the turn and failed to respond.

the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied through the final eighth the outermost of four latched on a sixteenth out and fought on to the
finish to secure the show honors. MALIBU PRO prompted the pace three then two wide, advanced to take over near the quarter pole, swung three wide for
home set down for the drive, inched away to the eighth pole, dug in under threat from a flanking trio and was overwhelmed at the sixteenth marker, battled
on but was outfinished in the late stages. AMERICAN LINCOLN four then three wide in aim of the leader, came under a drive midway on the turn, angled
four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. LEGIT devoid of speed early on, grew detached from the main body of the field and chased three to four
wide, went four to five wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. AJNADEEN coaxed from the gate, showed the way lightly coaxed along
just off the inside under pressure from a pair, tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front near the quarter
pole and cut the corner into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
WILD BANKER chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn advancing along the rail and coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong knocking heads with the
runner up through to the finish and just got the nod on the wire. JUST RIGHT chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, advanced on the
embattled pace dispute midway on the turn and emerged with a narrow command five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in
under threat, dueled through the final furlong with the aforementioned foe to his inside trading light bumps and leans and lost the bob on the line. COLD
HARD CASH eighth paths off the inside down the backstretch, vying for command among a quartet, tucked five then four wide through the turn advancing to
take command three furlongs from home, got headed at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and dug in under a drive running on to secure
the show honors. DANNY CALIFORNIA chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung two to three wide for home, offered up a mild
bid to the eighth pole, then flattened out in the late stages. DADDY KNOWS vied from the five path with a trio down the backstretch, tucked three then two
wide into the turn requiring off sided stick work appearing to want to remain out through the bend, came under coaxing at the three-eighths between foes
headed for command, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. PATEGORY ONE vied briefly between foes from the seven path before being
shaken off at the nine-sixteenths, tucked three wide through the turn and faded, swung five wide for home, tired and was eased to the finish. EL HERMANO
vied from the six path between foes among a quartet, tucked four then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, faded through the
latter portion of the bend and went four wide for home, tired and was eased through to the wire.

Footnotes
MADERA was hustled to the lead then well rated on an easy lead, dictated terms while inside on the turn, responded well when asked some near the
quarter-pole and drew off under a mild hand ride to win ridden out. VITANZA tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn
and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. GENTLE ANNIE settled off the pace, was urged four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch
under a drive and failed to respond while best of the rest. MEBS WEB was well placed just off the pace, chased in the two path on the turn and came up
empty. HAPPY SOPHIA settled on the outside, dropped back five wide on the turn and had nothing left.
