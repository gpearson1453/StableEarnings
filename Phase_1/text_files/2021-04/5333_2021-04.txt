Footnotes
NERVES OF STEEL prompted the pace from outside, headed rival past the three-eighths, dueled around the far turn and into the lane, gained command in
upper stretch, put away PLAY CHICKEN and held gamely over the the runner-up. GOLDINI reserved in the early stages, traveled two wide then tipped out
at the top of the plane, closed from outside but could not get by. PLAY CHICKEN set the pace from inside with NERVES OF STEEL applying pressure,
dueled with that rival around the far turn and into the stretch, fought back from along the inside to deep stretch and yielded late. SWIFT AS I AM bumped by
rival into the first turn, stalked outside that same foe to the far turn, angled in on that turn, chased within striking distance through the drive but could not
summon the needed late kick. DIVA'S FINALE off a bit slow to begin, drifted out and bumped rival into the first turn, tracked from inside then two wide into
the lane and came up empty.

LOVESICK BLUES set the pace on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, led clear to the sixteenth pole and held gamely. RAGING WATERS angled out
early, closed in four wide through the turn, rallied outside the winner in deep stretch but got denied. KENNEBEC stalked off the rail, raced three wide and
outside a rival around the turn, lacked the needed late bit but kept on to edge ME LIKEY for the show honors. ME LIKEY away quickly from outside, up
close early outside the leader, chased two wide through the turn, could not rally in the final furlong and got edged for the show. MY CHILD SBUD crowded
between rivals early, chased from inside into the turn, dropped back around the bend, injured at the three-sixteenths and was vanned off.

ALBIZU chased off the rail, took aim three wide into the stretch, headed the runner-up at the eighth pole and won clear. JOE DON LOONEY broke out and
bumped rival at the start, dueled from inside then inched ahead leaving the backstretch, cleared in upper stretch, headed by the winner with a furlong to go,
yielded but stayed on to finish a clear second. THELUTEISMINE bumped at the start, dueled for the lead from outside, pressed rival around the turn, lost
contact at the top of the stretch, flattened inside the furlong grounds but saved the show. RECKONING DAY tracked outside rival, went four wide into the
stretch and lacked a rally. GABBY HAYES got knocked into rival and shuffled back at the start, took the turn four then five wide and proved no menace.
MUSICAL GEM chased the speed along the inside and tired.

the place. SUPER CLASSIC traveled in the two path on the clubhouse turn, moved to the inside on the backstretch, angled out around the second bend,
came three wide into the stretch and got up for the show. WESTERN SMOKE vied from inside early then chased into the backstretch, lost ground around
the far turn, then grinded out the the final furlong but got edged for the show. BAM BAM AGAIN threw head and came away a bit slow, tracked between
runners then off the inside, entered the stretch three wide and flattened out. ZORICH chased three deep or four wide on the first turn, remained four wide
through the second bend and lacked further response. TEJON vied three deep on the clubhouse turn then chased outside a rival or off the inside, started to
weaken around the far turn, eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
CONSTANTIA settled at the back, raced along the inside into the turn then two wide into the drive, bumped with LEGGS GALORE and split foes at the top
of the lane, drew alongside the runner-up approaching the sixteenth pole and drove clear. SUPERSTITION pressed the pace from outside, challenged
around the turn, cleared in upper stretch but could not fend off the winner. BIDDY DUKE bumped at the start, tracked off the rail then moved inside, tipped
out at the top of the lane, brushed with the winner in upper stretch and finished willingly for the show honors. SHE'S SO SPECIAL tracked outside a rival
then angled out on the turn, took aim four wide into the stretch but flattened in the late stages. ANNANGEL (IRE) broke inward, had good early speed from
inside, set the pace inside of SUPERSTITION, fought with that rival around the turn, lost command leaving the bend and weakened. LEGGS GALORE
broke in and bumped BIDDY DUKE, was forwardly placed outside the top pair, bid three deep leaving the turn, bumped with the winner at the
three-sixteenths, got crowded at the eighth pole and faded.

and reeled in the runner-up. BIG WELL bumped with ACHILLEUS at the start, was up close early outside the pacesetter, lost a bit of ground into the far turn,
angled to the outside and took over at the top of the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch and got caught in the closing moments. MOUNT PELLIAR broke in
and bumped rival at the start, bumped with that same foe into the first turn, was caught six wide around the first turn then angled down to the three path,

flattened in the late stages but stayed on for a minor award. COASTAL KING up close early outside the top pair, bid alongside around the far turn, took over
near the five-sixteenths but weakened in the drive. BIG DISCOUNT settled along the inside, took closer order up the backstretch, came off the rail into the
stretch and weakened. TODAY MATTERS got bumped leaving the gate, bumped again into the first turn, traveled five wide while outside a rival on that
bend, came four to five wide into the stretch and never made an impact. CALL NINE ONE ONE went four wide around the first turn, dropped back on the

CE CE settled inside, moved closer leaving the backstretch, waited for room leaving the turn, slipped through along the fence and surged clear. MISS
STORMY D sped to the front and moved inside, met the bid from HAPPIER into the stretch, held that foe at bay but could not match the winner in the final
furlong while clearly second best. HIMIKO tracked off the inside, took the turn four wide and was along for the show. HAPPIER up close early outside the
pacesetter, bid into the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. BELLA VITA stalked off the rail, went three wide through the turn and failed to produce a
bid. QUERIDA DUBAI (ARG) went three then two wide around the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
ROYAL SHIP (BRZ) showed early speed alongside the leader first time through the stretch then stalked from outside, challenged around the far turn and
headed rival at the quarter pole, bumped with COUNTRY GRAMMER inside the eighth pole and dug in late to best the runner-up. COUNTRY GRAMMER
set the pace from inside, met the challenge from ROYAL SHIP around the far turn, bumped with that rival past the eighth pole, fought gamely to the wire but
had to settle for second best. INDEPENDENCE HALL stalked off the inside, coaxed around the far turn, urged right-handed into the stretch, could not
summon the needed response and finished a clear third. MAGIC ON TAP tracked outside a rival then two wide to the stretch and tired. GROWTH ENGINE
pulled around the clubhouse turn along the inside, dropped back on the far turn and came off the rail, eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
LA V. stalked off the inside, bid three deep around the turn, took over in upper stretch, cleared near the eighth pole and held safely in the closing moments.
SWEET SONNY chased three wide early then two wide into the turn, bid between rivals leaving the turn, was a bit tight entering the stretch, tipped outside
the top pair and finished willingly gain the place and close the gap on the winner. ROWANGOESHOLLYWOOD bumped inside rival at the start, tracked off
the rail then two wide into the turn, moved to the rail then back out into the two path exiting the turn, summoned a mild rally and earned the show. BAY
WITCH sped clear from inside, showed the way up the backstretch, tested past the five-sixteenths pole, relinquished control in upper stretch and tired in the
final furlong. BEST OF SHOW bumped with outside rival leaving the gate, sat far off the pace, entered the turn three wide, angled in leaving the turn and
finished well along the inside. BOTTLE NECK chased four wide through the turn and lacked a serious bid. MY GIRL PEARL raced in mid-pack through the
early stages, entered the turn five wide, moved into the four path around the bend and could not rally. LADY DOC lacked early speed, traveled four then
three wide around the bend and never made an impact. ELA CALIMERA MOU chased off the rail then moved inside, saved ground then came two wide into
the drive and never threatened. LADY BEYONCE chased outside a rival then three to four wide on the turn and weakened. HUMOR ME HARPER traveled
along the inside then two wide into the lane and was never a factor. IRISH SOUL stumbled at the start, dropped back up the backstretch, angled in on the
turn and came up empty.
