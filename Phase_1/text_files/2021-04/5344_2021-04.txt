Footnotes
LAUTREC away in good order, stalked the pace off the inside, asked along into the stretch, challenged the leader from the outside nearing the furlong
grounds, drove clear then held the runner up safe late. MR. PETERKIN settled off the pace and the inside, three wide second turn, moved closer past the
furlong marker then could not match the winner, clearly second best. LITTLE CHIEF cleared toward the inside into the first turn, set a soft pace, briefly stole
off to a larger lead exiting the final turn, could not contain the top two the final furlong, well clear of the others. MAJESTIC DAY one paced while racing in the
two path, lacked a closing response. WESTERN PHAROAH broke alertly, fell back off the pace, had nothing for the drive. WHEREVER HE IS off a step
slow, moved out three wide, never a threat while four wide through the second turn.

Footnotes
REDIVIVUS off a step slow, lacked speed while racing three wide, came four wide into the lane when advancing, continued to close with good resolve to be
up in time. PAPA STAR in the second flight outside, three wide turn, advanced to challenge in the three path entering the stretch, put a head in front just
inside the furlong grounds, led late, caught in the final strides. ROLL DINERO ROLL broke well, dueled up front in the run up the backstretch closest to the
inside, fell back off the other speed late in the turn, rebid along the inside midstretch then could not contain the top two, well clear of the others. BRASKA
broke in and slowly to spot the field a couple of lengths, asked along the inside early turn, improved position into the lane while continuing to saved ground,
no real threat to the top three late. MY FORTUNATE SON off a step slow, raced back while off the inside, passed tiring rivals while also not a serious threat.
STOMPING HOTROD away in good order, dueled early off the inside, shook clear late in the turn, caved in final furlong when confronted. MY LITTLE TIP
faded while racing along the inside. PRIVATE TRUTH in the second flight while off the inside, stopped in the turn, jogged in to finish far back.

second turn, came between foes into the lane, proved no match for the winner late, gained the nod for the place. BOATHOUSE VIEW off the early pace
while three wide in the first turn, continued outside, four wide through the second bend when moving to challenge, vied upper stretch, also proved no match
for the winner late, missed the place. FIERY LADY in the second flight off the inside, raced three then four wide into the lane, lacked a closing punch. DIXIE

Footnotes
AZTEC EMPIRE last away, trailed into first turn just off the inside, continued to lag up the backstretch, swung out to be five wide turning for home, finished
with good energy down the middle of the strip to kick down the leader in time. KATZARELLI broke well, closest to the leader off the inside, went after that
rival and collared him turning into the stretch, clear past the furlong marker, continued to lead by daylight late, caught final strides. REINSURE settled within
striking distance off the inside, crept closer three wide turning into the lane while inside the winner, flattened out in the late going but managed to be up late
for the show. MY BOY GUS away in good order, got clear in the first turn, set all the pace until headed by the runner up entering the stretch, gradually
weakened through the stretch, lost the show late. PAYNTER PARTY laciked ealry foot, lost irons between rivals backstretch, picked off a couple of tiring
rivals late while never a serious threat. WILD UNION failed to menace, tired drive. FRA MAURO settled in mid pack early, was finished after five furlongs.

Footnotes
EXULTING forwardly placed while four wide into the first turn, continued to prompt the issue from the outside, three wide bid midway on the second turn,
narrowly showed the way into the stretch in the two path, clear, maintained daylight late while being kept to task. HONORING MAJOR settled off the pace
and the ins inside, advanced three wide late in the final turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker under brisk handling, could do little with that rival
late, clearly second best. KURILOV (CHI) last away, trailed much of the way, swung four wide out of the final turn, staged a mild rally to be along for the
show. CANADIAN GAME vied up front along the inside, saved ground far turn, tired, caught late for the show. KNIGHTS KEY lacked speed while racing
outside, failed to muster a rally. BOBBY BABY vied early off the inside, took over in the two path, showed the way into the far turn, weakened when headed
by the winner soon after. MEISTERMIND finished after a half, stopped, fell far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
JACKMAN broke well, dueled early, disposed of the other speed into the lane to be clear, increased that advantage steadily to the wire while kept to
pressure. SOUTHSIDE SWIG broke sharp, dueled up front outside the winner, could not match that one in the drive, clearly second best while remaining
well off the inside. ALL EYES WEST in the second flight while off the inside, proved no match for the top two in the drive, edged clear for the show.
HOOKED A GOODWIN back off the early pace, dropped inside turn, staged a mild rally to improve position. CHICKEN TRUCK lacked speed well off the
inside, four wide through most of the turn, improved position through the stretch with some modest late interest. JINGLE off a step slow, raced far back,
three wide turn, also picked off some rivals late with some belated interest. F F ROCKET settled behind the pace off the inside, three wide out of the turn,
came up empty for the drive. NILES CHANNEL broke in the air, fell far back, picked off a few faltering rivals well after the issue had been decided.
SHANGHAI'S DREAM void of speed while widest up the backstretch, five wide early turn, four wide late, did not fire in a dull effort. RISE UP REDHAWK
broke in, straightened to raced in the second flight while closest to the inside, gave way in the drive. LOVE MY RIDE in mid pack early, steadily backed up
before a half, far back, jogged in.

QUEENS GIFT unhurried early, two path through most of the turn, angled out sharply entering the stretch, challenged on the outside of the lead pack
approaching the furlong marker, drove steadily clear. O K BABY with the pace while off the inside, between horses through the turn, challenged, briefly led
upper stretch, no match for the winner late, held sway for the place. JUST LIFE broke out, was straightened to race off the pace and outside, four wide into
the lane, up late for the show. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED broke on top, narrowly set the pace along the inside, weakened in the drive. W W VALID pressed
the issue three wide through the turn, weakened in the drive. INCLUDEANATTITUDE off slow, continued to race sluggishly, fell far back, galloped in.

Footnotes
HISSY MISSY off the pace while toward the inside first turn, moved closer along the rail into the far turn, tracked the pace through that bend, squeezed
through a narrow opening along the inside turning for home, shifted out when approaching the leader in midstretch, took over, well clear at the end under
steady handling. ZANSHOES broke alertly, showed the way through the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to hold a daylight
advantage into the stretch, could not contain the winner, well clear of the rest. SUPERSTAR BEA lacked early foot off the inside, moved a bit closer in the
second turn, came three wide into the lane, continued that moderate rally to be clear for the show at the end, no threat to the top pair. TOO PRETTY
prompted the pace from the two path much of the way, had little left for the drive. STARRGARITA in mid pack while racing outside, three out to four wide
exiting the final turn, went one paced to the wire in lacking a closing punch. SATTERSFIELD saved ground to no avail in an even effort. FLORIDA BIRD four
wide when forwardly placed in the first turn, remained within striking distance for six furlongs then tired in the drive. FLATOUTANDFOXY broke back, lacked
speed and failed to menace. TIDDLY last away, angled out to be four wide and improve a bit midway on the final turn, went flat in the drive. DUTCH TREAT
remained always back with a three wide trip. BETTYANN prompted the early pace off the inside, stopped far turn, jogged in.

challenged when straightened for home, kicked clear under steady handling. MOCHA KISS settled off the pace and the inside, two path when moving a bit
closer late in the final turn, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, clearly second best. COMPETITIVE FIRE void of speed in trailing for five
furlong, advanced and circled seven wide into the lane, rallied well out in the strip to be in time for the show, not a threat to the top pair. JEWEL AZUL within
striking distance just off the inside, shuffled to lose position inside of considerable traffic second turn, two path into the lane, dropped inside, improved
position late up the inside. LONGNTALL settled in mid pack toward the inside, in some traffic and three wide into the stretch, improved position a bit while
not a serious threat. WILD ESCAPE slight bother start, moved closer after a half, four wide through the second turn when within striking distance, came up
empty for the drive. I'M EXCEE raced in a forward position for six furlongs three wide, had little for the drive. UNBURNT bobbled, broke out and steadied,
pulled early when well back, continued to lack speed, six wide into the lane, lacked a serious closing response. AMELIA'S BONNET off a step slow, trailed
into far turn, saved ground through much of that bend, traffic into the stretch, failed to threaten. SHOOT ME STRAIGHT took command from the outside first
turn, showed the way up the backstretch then gave way when headed midway on the final turn. IKE LIKES pressed the issue early inside, stopped.
