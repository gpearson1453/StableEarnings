Footnotes
STAY HYDRATED settled inside, bid into the stretch then wore down the leader in the final stride. LIAR SIDE CHAT set a clear pace off the inside,
remained clear in mid stretch but was nailed at wire. POLPIS pursued the pacesetter three wide and continued willingly to the finish. PAINT MUSIC FOR
ME rated behind the early leaders then made a gradual late gain. JUDICIAL RESTRAINT trailed early, made a brief bid before half a mile then faded.
PETER G. FOX stumbled at the start, raced far back and lacked a rally. FOXBOROUGH chased wide and gave way readily.

HEART OF A DREAMER stalked wide for half a mile, bid to the front on the final turn, moved clear in the stretch then just lasted. SUPERHIGHWAY settled
inside, angled out into the stretch, moved back inside and rallied too late. KNOKKE BY THE SEA trailed inside early, rallied into the stretch then flattened
out. INCLUNATION chased in midpack between rivals and continued willingly. MY AMANJENA raced wide throughout, made a brief bid on final turn then
faded. GENERAL prompted the pace three wide and gave way after three quarters. BILL'S MAFIA saved ground close up, angled out before the half then
faded. MIDNIGHT WHISKEY set a clear pace for five furlongs then stopped abruptly. DRUMMOND dropped back early and was never in contention.

outkicked. JAMMIN JIMTOWN tracked early on, then vied inside at the half mile marker, dueled inside on the far turn, took over, drifted out at the quarter

tired late . FLAT OUT FLASHY saved ground off the leaders, moved closer before the half, angled wide then tired. BORSA VENTO hustled to the front
