ROCK THIS BAR bobbled slightly at the start, was hustled into contention to set early fractions while saving ground, continued saving ground into the drive
and kicked clear as much the best. DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI stalked the early leader through the backstretch run, saved ground while two wide on the turn,
was roused for the drive and was outfinished by the winner though still second best. NACHO VICTORY was unhurried early, gained position along the turn
while saving ground, and made a steady bid in the stretch to get third. BUBBLES IS ON FIRE settled toward the rear of the field in the early stages, was
widest on the turn while improving position, but could not muster a late rally in the stretch. RUN IT TO WIN chased the early leaders through the backstretch
run, lost position along the turn while two wide and was empty for the stretch run.

shoulder once inside the eighth pole and kicked clear, while running on her left lead through the finish. MISS SUPER SAINT settled midpack through the

STATEFOREST settled early, saving ground through the backstretch and onto the second turn, was two wide on the turn while nimbly navigating traffic and
angled out for the stretch drive where she dug in and wore down HOLY CATHOLIC for the win. HOLY CATHOLIC sat just off of the early pace, was two
wide between horses while advancing position, took the lead into the drive, was confronted by STATEFOREST and could not hold that one off late. SASSY
EINSTEIN was unhurried early, settling at the rear of the field through the backstretch and onto the second turn while saving ground, swung out for the drive
and made a late bid for third. BIG AWARD chased the pace early, then settled midpack through the backstretch run, was four wide on the second turn and
tired in the stretch run. ANGELS HOLIDAY took control of the early pace, saved ground through the backstretch and onto the second turn, lost position off of
the turn and tired in the drive. ABIGAIL ALDEN settled toward the back of the field early, improved position along the backstretch while chasing the pace,

for the win late. AMERICAN FARMER was unhurried early, settled at the back of the field through the early going, three wide on the second turn, advanced
position off of the turn, was outfinished by the winner but was second best. CONO set early fractions from a ground saving running position, was two wide
into the backstretch and second turn, was confronted by INDIAN PEAK at the top of the stretch and had no late rally. INDIAN PEAK settled in the midflight
early, was three wide on the first turn, advanced position along the backstretch, was four wide along the turn, led at the top of the stretch but weakened in
the drive. SACRED RIDER pressed the early pace of CONO from a ground saving position, vied for the lead along the turn while saving ground, was
headed at the top of the stretch and tired late. ENCODER chased the early pace, lost position along the backstretch, was two wide along the turn and
flattened out late. JAMMERS JUSTICE settled toward the back of the field in the early stages, was four wide along the first turn, improved position along the
backstretch, was five wide along the second turn and was empty in the drive.

Footnotes
POINT BREAK pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but responded in the final furlong and closed fast to prevail.
EXQUISITE LEGACY stalked the pace in the three path to the stretch, was also outrun to mid stretch but kept to task and finished well to tag
BEAUTYINTHESKY for second. BEAUTYINTHESKY The latter set all the pace from the rail to the stretch, edged clear to mid stretch then was tiring and
was nabbed for second on the line. FAST TO FORTUNE chased the pace to the turn, was three wide to the stretch then eased out and was gaining late.
TIGER'S WISH also chased to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response. SHARP CURVE broke a bit slow, had no speed and
was not a factor. PERFECTLY JULIE also had no speed, took up after VELOCEMENTE went wrong nearing the quarter pole then came up empty.
VELOCEMENTE had no speed, was very wide on the turn then went wrong, lost her rider and was vanned off.
