IMAGINE WINNING , urged soon after the break, hugged the inner rail the first turn and down the backstretch, was taken to the three path approaching the
far turn, bid for the lead outside MARTINI LANE mid way on the bend, dueled through the stretch and drove clear late. MARTINI LANE , right to the early
lead, set the pace along the inner rail, dueled through the stretch and was out finished. ROCKIN RON , two wide on the turns, swung to the four path
approaching the stretch and passed tired rivals. CLASSY SOLUTION prompted the pace to the far turn then weakened. TALE OF DIXIE , along the inner
rail throughout, weakened. FINE N DANDY , shuffled back soon after the break, failed to be a factor and was eased late. STAND MY GROUND trailed.

Footnotes
MOONROCK , off last, rushed up outside horses leaving the backstretch, gained the lead outside ABOVE THE LIMIT mid way on the turn, opened up in mid
stretch and held sway under steady handling. ABOVE THE LIMIT broke alertly to make the early lead, raced near the inner rail, lost the advantage into the
stretch, angled out in upper stretch and finished willingly. EYE OF THE NEEDLE lacked speed, swung three wide leaving the turn and had a mild rally. I
LOVE MAGEL bobbled at the break, hugged the inner rail around the turn and failed to rally. DIAMOND IN THE SUN raced in the two path on the turn and
gave way in the stretch.

RATIFY , well placed in the two path between horses down the backstretch and on the far turn, eased outside approaching the stretch, swept to command
in upper stretch and drew out late. WICKED PRANKSTER sprinted to the early lead, angled in entering the first turn, set the pace along the rail, lost the lead
in upper stretch but dug in stubbornly to hold the pace. MIAMI MUMBLES , steadied in traffic approaching the first turn, raced three wide on the first turn,
chased the pace outside WICKED PRANKSTER and flattened out in the stretch. AND SEEK raced inside horses much of the trip, failed to menace and
passed tired ones. DA CHROME , four wide the first turn, raced three wide the far turn and lacked a rally. ICE RAIN lacked speed, came out and bumped
with MINE NOT MINE when eager to go leaving the backstretch, steadied on a rival's heels near the quarter pole then failed to sustain his move. CLAW
weakened. MINE NOT MINE broke sluggishly, lacked speed, bumped with ICE RAIN leaving the backstretch then came up empty.

Footnotes
ZIP THE LIP sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and prevailed under steady urging. JACKIE A raced in the two path between horses on
the turn, swung to the four path entering the stretch and rallied outside horses while racing a bit greenly in the drive. COSA MAS LINDA , in the two path
around the turn while chasing the winner, lugged in near the eighth pole. CHARLIE POTATOES , bumped by INJECT THE LIGHT leaving the starting gate,
raced in the two path between horses on the turn and offered a mild rally inside rivals. FLASH LIGHTENING bumped with PEPE AND HEYWOOD at the
start, angled five deep turning for home and passed tired foes. PEPE AND HEYWOOD bumped with FLASH LIGHTENING leaving the starting gate, chased
the pace while three deep on the turn and gave way. RAEFORD , fractious in the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor.
INJECT THE LIGHT bumped CHARLIE POTATOES when bearing in at the break, circled the turn three deep, gave way in upper stretch and was eased
late.

ABUELO PAPS hugged the inner rail disputing the pace, opened a clear lead in mid stretch, then drifted out inside the sixteenth pole, bumping and herding
FAST BREAK. FAST BREAK stalked the duel to mid turn, eased out to the four path approaching the stretch, reached contention near the sixteenth pole
then was bumped and herded out by ABUELO PAPS. ROYAL CRUSADER saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch, swung to the
four path near the sixteenth pole and rallied on his left lead. MOOSE LODGE lacked speed, swung wide in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. FLAT OUT
FLYING , steadied leaving the starting gate, was not a factor and raced four deep on the turn. HONOR RUN disputed the early pace between horses and
weakened in upper stretch. BEAR TREASURE was not a factor. INSIDE RISK showed speed three deep, gave way in upper stretch and was eased late.
Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of FAST BREAK, ABUELO PAPS was disqualified and placed second.
