RUN BUBBA RUN a step slow through the turn emerged in upper stretch taking aim abreast rival rallying up in the final stages. CAT HEAT stalked the pace
through the turn rallying past a tiring pacesetter into upper stretch being hooked from the outside late ceding grudgingly under brisk left hand urging. NEVUS
off slowly lagged through the turn losing ground to upper stretch responding after the fact at mid track. GOES TOO FAST tracked the pace racing evenly to
upper stretch lacking a contending move there. MACADOOOO KID faded on the turn. HOME RUN POWER rushed clear led through the turn then wilted on
the rail into upper stretch. NOTHINLASTSFOREVER was always outrun.

Footnotes
DANCIN' ROSIE broke sharply nursing a narrow lead under pressure through the turn, had rival measured in upper stretch edging to daylight holding sway
to wire. STATUS SYMBOL sent hard pressured shadowing rival through the turn, ceded daylight to foe in upper stretch remaining very willing though no
match late. FORTUNATE GINA tracked the pace coming under a stiff drive in the four path down the lane making no headway while holding position.
ADVENTURE LAND pressed then chased on the turn fading wide in upper stretch. MY BELLE MICHELLE slow early played no factor. CHECK OUT LINE
saving ground throughout was never involved. MISTY MOONLIGHT played no factor. GIFT FROM MOM was always a step slow.

Footnotes
QUIET DAWN tracked evenly through the turn bidding four wide in upper stretch edging up gamely abreast foe late. PRECIOUS ARCH saved ground
surging on the rail in upper stretch dueling gamely to wire. OSPREY COURT squeezed back at the break raced a step slow through the turn came five wide
into upper stretch finding best stride too late. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL raced mid pack rallying between horses into upper stretch being crowding lacking
room from the eighth pole. HONOR BAR slow early played no factor. MISS MAC pressed then chased on the turn wresting the lead in upper stretch wearing
out on the inside late. FLAT OUT APPEALING set the pace clearing on the turn then wilted in upper stretch. CASCABELL QUEEN stumbled after the break
losing the rider, walked off.
