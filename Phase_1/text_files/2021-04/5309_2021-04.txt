late, but was best of rest. AKIANE'S SOLDIER dueled for the early lead, raced outside around the second turn and weakened. APHRODITES REVENGE

HARLANS WARRIOR sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task. HONEST WOMAN lacked early speed, came around the
final turn on the outside, made a wide bid and got up late for second. OLD FASHION AMOUR pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a
late kick. PROMISE TENDER raced within striking distance, made a mild bid and hung. COSTA SUGAR raced near the middle of the field, finished wide
and put forth an even effort. MISS GURETTA raced near the back, came around the first turn on the outside and was never close. MONEY SUNK always
raced near the back and showed little. BRAHMS' REGAL GAL raced within contention, saved ground and made a steady retreat.

Footnotes
DARPA challenged for the early lead, took command around the final turn, pulled away and proved the best. KODIAK SKY void of early speed, moved up
on the outside around the final turn, made a four wide bid and got up for second. ORB'S SOUL raced near the middle of the pack, saved ground and was
caught late for second. MEMORY MAGIC hesitated, hopped at the start, racing in the rear, made a steady gain and put forth a game effort. GEORGIA
DAWN pressed the early pace, eased back, saved ground around the final turn, moved up, but was no factor. KRIS T. pressed the early pace and faded.
SUNDEREYA raced near the back, came around the first turn wide and was never a threat. WENEEDTOTALK always raced near the back and showed
little. BONITA SPRINGS vied for the early lead and was finished early. HOLY SONG dueled on the front end, stopped and was eased.

Footnotes
DATA LOAD pressed the pace, drove clear around the final turn, pulled away and was ridden out. COMMON LAW CAT dueled for the early lead, forwardly
placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. POPPI IS SMILING unhurried in the early part, racing near the middle of the
field, made a bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. VALIANT DEFENDER lacked early speed, raced outside around the first turn, made
a mild bid, but was no factor. LIGHTNING LEE raced in the back of the field in the early part, came around the second turn wide, showed late interest, but
was no real threat. LIL BIT OF JUSTICE raced within contention, saved ground around the second turn and weakened. CH BERN raced evenly near the
back and was outrun. GRAND LITTLE MAN raced in the middle of the pack and dropped back. JR'S SAUVAGE dueled on the front end, saved ground and
tired.
