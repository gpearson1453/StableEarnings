FEARLESS ANNA chased the two rival duel through the turn while in the three path, asked for more entering the lane, caught the leader near the eighth
pole then edged clear through the final sixteenth. MARINA NIGHT vied for the early lead two wide into the turn, cleared in late turn and into the lane, was
caught by the winner near the eighth pole then yielded to that one while keeping on for the place spot. JUMP RIGHT IN vied for the lead along the inside
though mid-turn, lost ground into the lane, re-engaged outside the eighth pole then could not keep up the momentum. HITCHED was in the three path
through the turn, angled to the rail entering the lane and never was a threat. JULIPS HOLD was never a factor while near the rail through the turn.

Footnotes
IVORYSGOLDTREASURE was brushed and forced out a bit at the start, raced off the inside into the backstretch, bid three wide approaching the far turn,
gained the lead at once, cleared through mid-turn and widened through the lane while unchallenged and being ridden out. TRADITIONAL ARCHER was
squeezed and shut off at the start, raced in the back into the backstretch, moved up in late turn while near the inside, came further off the rail for the drive
and passed a rival to gain the distant place spot. OMI TEN was along the inside through the first, raced in the three path into the far turn to get nearest the
winner, chased that one into the lane and lacked a closing bid while losing the place spot inside the eighth pole. GUCCI GAL stepped out start, moved to set
the pace into the backstretch, continued on a short lead approaching the far turn, could not keep up through the turn and continued to lose ground. LAKE
SENSE pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch and was done in mid-turn. MAJESTIC RAJ was moving up between rivals approaching the far
turn, put in tight, checked, dropped back and was done. AN INQUIRY TO THE START OF THE RACE DID NOT RESULT IN A CHANGE OF ORDER.

Footnotes
CACAHUETE stalked the pace from the three path down the backstretch, bid into the far turn, quickly cleared, maintained the margin into the lane, was
asked for more and extended through the lane while being kept to the task to the end. WILDCARD PRADO trailed for three-quarters, was asked for more in
mid-turn while coming off the inside, swung into the five path for the drive and moved up to be clear for the place spot. DOX FOLLY chased the pace from
the inside into the far turn, was shuffled as others made their bids, continued in the two path into the lane and was up for show spot while not a threat.
PENTIMENTO raced in the three path into the far turn when never far back, was asked for more near the three-eighths pole, hard ridden into the lane from
the five path then flattened out. PEGASUS ON THE GO set the pace while near the rail for half, could not go with the winner through the turn, continued to
chase that one into the lane then gave way once straightened. EASY DOER was jostled between rivals at the start, raced in good position into the far turn
while in the three path then lacked a response.

Footnotes
CASH LOGISTICS stalked the four rival pace down the backstretch, continued in the five path into the far turn, bid four wide leaving the turn, hooked up with
the runner-up when straightening then inched up to the wire. BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN vied for the lead while in the two path, continued under pressure
from several rivals, lost the lead into the far turn, regained the top spot into mid-turn, shook off two challengers into the lane, engaged with the winner and
could not hold that one safe after a game effort. NOT VERY GENTLE was bothered at the start and settled back, raced near the inside into the far turn,
hustled up the inside in late turn, cut the corner into the lane and became a contender, could not go with the top two but stayed on well to be clear for the
show spot. BAYOU CAT was in the four or five path through the turns, bid five wide into the lane, was a serious threat entering the lane from the six path
then flattened out. WILD WEEKEND pressed the pace from between rivals through the turn then weakened in the stretch run. ARTEMUS EAGLE was never
a factor while along the inside. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER pressed the pace from between rivals into the far turn then was done.

inside, angled four wide into the stretch and closed inside the winner. MATERS N TATERS was clear early but was caught. CIELO AZUL was off
awkwardly, raced inside, bid in early stretch but faltered. HERE COMES TREY pressed the early pace, bid at the half-mile pole, led inside and drew off
under mild urging. EL BOHEMIO stalked in the four path, then gave way in the stretch. S S TROOPER saved ground, then had no late bid.
BETSDOWNLETSRIDE raced evenly.
