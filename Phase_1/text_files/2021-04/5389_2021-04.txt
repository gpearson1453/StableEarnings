ANNIE'S BOY broke sharply with the lead and rated the pace, came under pressure past the three eighths pole, dug in under an all out drive through the
stretch and just lasted. RAMBLIN' MAN stalked the early pace then gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close in the five path of the turn,
steadily progressed through the lane and just missed. TWO THE PUNCH settled close to the early pace then picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the six path of the turn, was along for third inside the furlong pole and finished evenly. HEY PILGRIM raced off the early pace
toward the inside, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and rounded the turn just off the rail, had range on the winner entering the stretch but lacked
further. MYSTIC REALITY raced off the pace outside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the turn about the six path, angled back
toward the inside entering the stretch, though, showed little more.

BEAT THE HEAT settled off the pace about the three path, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, angled
four wide leaving the turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and drew away the final sixteenth. MONUMENTAL SEVEN stalked inside then bid into the far turn,
dug in at the rail from the head of the lane and was determined in the duel for second. ARIZONA JEREMY stalked off the rail, bid into the far turn and raced
close three wide through the turn, drifted a bit into the stretch and remained close to mid-stretch, then outfinished in the later duel for second. FAMOUS
ROCK STAR took the lead shortly after the start and rated the pace inside, came under pressure into the far turn, dueled with the edge through the upper
stretch but was caught mid-stretch and weakened the final furlong.

bit through the stretch and held on. KID CAT stalked toward the outside then challenged leaving the three eighths pole, appeared a factor through the turn
and dug in close down the lane, but needed more while gaining steadily late. SEVEN POINTS stalked through the backstretch then bid leaving the three
eighths pole, raced in the five path of the turn and came along for third past the eighth pole. BONITA BALLARD stalked inside, dropped back leaving the
three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the turn then flattened stride into the lane. GLIMPSEDINTHEMIST dwelt at the break, raced well back and came

rated the pace well off the rail, continued the advantage firmly in hand in the five path of the far turn, came under riders' pressure mid-stretch but was caught
at the sixteenth pole and relented. STEPHEN JAMES raced in the four path the first turn then challenged toward the three eighths pole, remained close in

ARIZONA SUN rated a slim lead outside, raced with the advantage in the three and four paths of the turn, came under pressure into the stretch and drew off
under steady handling. MY CRAFTY GAL stalked the winner toward her inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and angled to the five path to
come around that one into the stretch, though, proved no match and had to settle for second best. SHOE GAME settled back outside through the
backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the turn about the seven path and was along for third the final strides. OUTSIDE
THE LAW stalked from the inside early on then gave chase leaving the nine sixteenths pole, rounded the turn about the four path, angled back toward the
inside entering the stretch but weakened inside the eighth pole and was nipped from third under the wire. SIERRITA raced well back and well off the rail.

Footnotes
SASHAYING SIS accelerated to the front and raced clear toward the half mile pole, then dug in determinedly under steady stretch encouragement to hold
off the late arrival of DANCES FOR KAMIA and the next two finishers, while the latter, settled off the pace through the backstretch, bid nearing the five
sixteenths pole and raced in the five path of the turn, then dug in through the stretch to take second the final strides. HAIL ON HOOFS gave chase from the
half mile pole and raced close in the four path of the turn, dueled through the stretch but was outfinished for second the final strides. SHESAHEATWAVE
raced well back toward the inside early on, bid leaving the nine sixteenths pole and improved off the rail on the turn, raced close through the stretch but was
outfinished for second and third the final strides. SUPAH SISTA gave chase outside and drifted extremely wide nearing the top of the stretch, dug in when
straightened away and finished well; widest. UH OH SEVEN was not a factor and rounded the turn about the six path.

the quarter pole, dueled clear mid-stretch and widened the final furlong. YO Y ME closed to the front past the nine sixteenths pole and rated a slim lead,
came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was caught toward the quarter, dropped back a furlong away and flattened stride. DIMERA gave chase
toward the outside through the backstretch, entered the turn in the five path, angled to the seven path toward the head of the lane and dug in through the
lane to take third a sixteenth away. RUNNING FOR GUS came away slow and raced well off the pace through the backstretch, started a bid approaching
the three eighths pole, was stranded in the eight path nearing the head of the lane then outfinished for third. MAXX EFFORT raced off the pace inside, bid
nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the turn just off the rail, then flattened out inside the eighth pole. I B EZ raced with the early pace and gave
chase from the nine sixteenths pole, dueled close in the four path of the turn, angled to the six path approaching the top of the stretch but showed little
further.
