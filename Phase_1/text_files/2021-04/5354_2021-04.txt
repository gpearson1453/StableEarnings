Footnotes
CARMELTINI raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far turn, rallied three wide into the lane, took over past the furlong marker and drew clear
under urging. CONNOISSEUR was off a bit slow, moved up to set the pace, opened up a clear lead, showed the way on the far turn, drifted out some
entering the lane, then dug in gamely in the two path and earned the place spot. PASATIME stumbled at the start, pulled in the early stages along the rail,
then tracked, chased on the far turn, angled in behind CONNOISSEUR entering the stretch, rallied mildly on the rail, then angled back out and finished
evenly. MINESHAFT MAGIC raced four wide early, settled off the pace, went three wide on the far turn and had no rally. BETTER BEGIN was outrun.
RUNNING GIRL stalked two wide and gave way.

ALGORIX saved ground in the second flight, angled out in the stretch and drew away through the stretch. PRINTER lacked speed inside, moved wide on
the final turn and rallied mildly. RINGS OF JUPITER raced off the pace outside, bid on the final turn then flattened. EDEN RIDGE lagged far behind then
passed rivals while no threat. BANKER'S ISLAND alternated for the lead inside then gave way after three quarters. ARRIVEDERCI broke slowly, chased
wide and weakened steadily. BLINDING prompted the pace outside and faded after five furlongs.

PENANCE reluctant loading, forced the pace outside, took over midway on the final turn then drew off while kept to her task. ROSE OF DUBLIN well placed
off the dueling leaders, bid midway on the final turn but proved no match for the winner. GALILEO'S AFFAIR lagged far behind inside then rallied mildly
through the stretch. GATOR GIRL hustled to the front inside, was collared into the far turn and weakened. ANISSA lacked speed and was never in
contention. VOLODINA prompted the pacesetter inside to the three eighths pole and faded.

moved up three wide on the turn, rallied mildly and bested the others. I'M THIRSTY stalked outside, chased on the turn and tired. MORISSETTE raced off
the pace inside and failed to threaten. ATLANTIC AVENUE raced three wide off the pace, came wide passing the quarter pole and tired. ROCHELA chased

CONGRATS ANSWER outrun early, split foes advancing on the turn, swung wide in the stretch and eagerly pulled away. IWASBORNAWINNER dueled
between rivals in the opening quarter and continued willingly holding on for the place. VALERIE FIRST dropped far behind inside then offered some late
energy. ALEDA LUTZ prompted the pace inside and flattened out in the stretch. SWEET LILLY FACTUM earned a narrow lead between rivals, moved clear
briefly on the turn and came up empty late. CONGAREE ROSE urged close up four wide down the backstretch and gave way. WILLTHISSHIPSAIL lacked
speed racing wide and was always outrun. BELLAMY CAT lagged far back and lost contact with her field.

Footnotes
CARTOUCHE set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid from SOLID GOLD DANCER on the turn, drew off in the lane, widened and was ridden out.
POWWA OF LOVE raced off the pace, chased on the turn, rallied on the rail in the final furlong and was just up for second. HEY DEWZPOTS chased
inside, moved up on the turn, rallied mildly between horses and just missed for the place spot. OUTLINE chased between rivals early, raced two wide on the
turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. SOLID GOLD DANCER showed good speed outside, made a bid on the turn and weakened.
UNFORGETTABLE KISS was off a step slow, raced off the pace and did not factor. CORBALLY was outrun.

Footnotes
OUR SWEET GIRL set the pace inside, moved clear on the turn and remained safe under steady handling. UNION RALLY chased close up inside and
finished willingly as second best. MIRACULOUSBLESSING broke sluggishly, rushed up inside, angled out into the stretch then flattened out. AEGEAN SEA
dropped far behind, swung extremely wide into the stretch. ORIGINALY FROM DOT lacked speed and was never in contention. BAHAMA BREEZE
prompted the pace wide to the stretch and weakened. OUR DIXIE BLUE forced the pace outside, had her heels clipped at the quarter pole causing an injury
to a rear leg, was eased and subsequently vanned off. HAY NINETEEN made a menacing move between foes at the quarter pole where she clipped heels,
bobbled badly and lost her rider.

Footnotes
FIFTY showed good early speed to set the pace, dueled with SAMADI SKY turning for home, dug in gamely inside of that rival in the final furlong, battled
back determinedly and prevailed late. SAMADI SKY chased four wide early, made a bid nearing the quarter pole, rallied to a short lead outside of FIFTY,
then dug in gamely to the finish. DON'T MAKE IT EASY was off a bit slow, chased inside, raced inside on the turn, angled out entering the stretch and
rallied mildly. BOB'S MY UNCLE chased between rivals and was in a bit tight near the half mile marker, moved out for the drive and finished evenly in the
final furlong. E J'S REVENGE raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn and failed to rally. VERY COLORFUL raced three wide off the pace, came
wide for the drive and passed tired rivals. WUSHU WARRIOR raced off the pace between horses, went four wide past the quarter pole and failed to
threaten. INKY DINKY DO raced off the pace, four wide on the turn, continued four wide at the quarter pole and did not factor. THOMAS KNIGHT raced
three or four wide throughout and did not factor. THE POOCH chased three wide and faded.
