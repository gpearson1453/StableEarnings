Footnotes
PERFECT PIRATE was sent to share the lead two wide, moved ahead when asked midstretch, was clear with a sixteenth to go and held off COME ON
DOVER. The latter was rated off the early pace, angled out some on the bend, came into the lane from path five, closed well but was too late. YABA DABA
DOO without early speed, advanced from inside on the turn, angled out three wide nearing the furlong marker, threatened but leveled off in the waning
yards. ROSKI dueled for the lead from inside to midstretch then began to wear down. GREAT GRET pressed the early pace, floated out to path four
entering the stretch and began to wear down. EL CAMINANTE was a brief factor but began to yield from between rivals on the bend.

Footnotes
TRAVEL WEST stalked the pacesetters three wide, went for the lead with three furlongs left, soon moved clear and held sway while under a drive until the
waning yards. DAVKA shared the lead outside a rival for three furlongs then lacked the extra needed to stay with TRAVEL WEST. JOEY B displayed early
speed from inside, was no match for TRAVEL WEST when set down for the drive and began to wear down the last furlong. TOCCETIVE JAC saved ground
and only passed a couple tired rivals. JAGUAR RIDGE raced in contention from outside for six furlongs then began to wear down. WOOD NOT MIND
chased from just off the rail, angled out leaving the turn for a clear path but came up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
LAURA ATTACK was quickly clear, showed the way in hand, was put to a drive into the lane and kept to task to the waning yards. BOWS N LACE bobbled
a bit at the break and started a chain reaction of bumping, advanced four wide on the turn, rallied belatedly in the lane but was clearly second best.
DIAMOND STELLAR chased from between rivals, lacked a serious stretch bid but pulled ahead for third late. BEZEL SET advanced from inside on the bend
but failed to have a stretch bid. PINCH MINE raced closest to the pacesetter from just off the rail but flattened out the last eighth. THE MORE I BURN
squeezed shortly after the break, was just off the inside taking the bend and had no late bid. FADED ROSE was squeezed as well between horses after the
start, chased from between horses and failed to menace. KARMA REIGNS was squeezed back soon after the start, angled in, swung out for the stretch run
and had little to offer. AFFIRMANCE also squeezed early, was shuffled back from close quarters nearing the quarter pole and empty for the drive.
CAUSELUCK showed little.

MEGAN'S HONOR rated off the early speed, took over when asked and drew away under urging the last furlong. RICHIESONARAMPAGE soon took the
lead, showed the way just off the rail, proved no match for MEGAN'S HONOR but was unchalleneged for second. B SALTY raced in contention toward the
outside, was three wide on the bend and fought for third through the lane. PRANCIPANTS chased from just off the rail, dueled for third in the stretch but did
not have enough left. BUMPTYBUMPBUMP saved ground through the bend, angled out deep stretch but lacked a significant response. JUST RUN just off
the inside taking the turn, angled out four wide upper stretch but had little to offer. PRINCE ABUBU was never a factor.

DIAMONDS AND BOOTS moved ahead for a clear lead on the backstretch, was headed upper stretch but did not relent and came in the waning yards to
edge ahead. DOLLY'S LINE was kept close, came to DIAMONDS AND BOOTS leaving the turn, had a slight advantage midstretch, fought gamely to the
wire but had to settle for second best. CREAL DREAMER pressed from between rivals, floated out to path four into the stretch and rallied belatedly to gain
third. MY PERFECT WINGS came into contention from inside on the bend, angled out three wide for a clear path upper stretch, had every chance the last
eighth but finished evenly. DIAMOND GUCCI pressed from outside for two furlongs then gradually yielded. ABBMAR was prominent between horses but
began to tire with three furlongs left. CHRISTY ATTACK failed to menace.

KIPPER DOODLE broke on top and was urged clear, challenged from outside on the turn, took the rail into the lane and gradually shook off LOUIE P while
under a drive. LOUIE P pressed from outside, was crowded and brushed by LIL BIT TIPSEY into the bend, went to KIPPER DOODLE nearing the quarter
pole, was no match for the latter in the lane but proved easily second best. LIL BIT TIPSEY pressed from inside, angled out some nearing the bend to gain a
wider path, brushed with LOUIE P, waited for room on the turn, angled out three wide at the top of the lane then gave way. SPICE IT UP moved to the
outside early on and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
RUBY LEES SONG showed the way in hand, was roused at the top of the lane and steadily opened up while kept to a drive until the final seventy yards.
DON'T HOLD QUEENS bumped with REJOICE AN BE GLAD shortly after the break, was settled toward the outside, four wide on the turn, fanned to the
middle of the track for the drive and gained second late. TROPHY BRIDLE void of early speed, angled to the inside entering the turn, steadily advanced
along the rail in the stretch and was narrowly outfinished for the place. W W PUT AND TAKE in contention early from outside, angled in some into the bend,
progressed three wide, floated out slightly upper stretch, fought for second briefly inside the last eighth then leveled off. MIZ CLIPPER bumped from both
sides shortly after the start, was steadied when her path was taken into the turn, angled out, advanced four wide, came out further for the stretch run, was
crowded briefly by W W PUT AND TAKE upper stretch and also leveled off in the waning yards. WAY TOO SMARTE chased from inside, gradually angled
out through the lane trying to gain a clear path but failed to have the extra left in the late going. REJOICE AN BE GLAD also bumped on both sides in the
early going, came into the stretch from path four and had no late bid. PRAISEM bumped shortly after the break, was hustled along to be a brief factor but
faded between rivals after two furlongs. SEE GRACE FLY BY pressed RUBY LEES SONG from just outside, proved no match for that one when set down
for the drive and gave way between horses inside the final eighth.
