Footnotes
MELTECH stalked two deep then challenged nearing the three eighths pole, took the nod approaching the quarter, contested the advantage in the three
path of the far turn, dueled clear through the upper stretch and was steadily handled to widen. LUCKY PENGUIN saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the
three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then came along to take second later yards. AUBURN MILL rated a slim lead inside, came under
pressure leaving the three eighths pole and gave up the nod toward the quarter, remained close near the rail on the far turn then flattened stride inside the
eighth pole. MAN OF THE NIGHT stalked the earlier pace about the three path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn
about the four path, though, showed little more. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE was outrun. KITE SURFER rounded the opening turn about the five path and raced
outside into the backstretch, showed little response and it appeared as if the rider lost his balance and fell off nearing the wire. The Stewards posted the
inquiry prior to declaring this race official.

engaged in close chase two deep while between horses down the backstretch, dropped back approaching the quarter pole, drifted outward toward the top of
the lane but dug in to recover second late. FLUENT IN SARCASM gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened stride. CASH FOR THE SOUL
gave chase outside, rounded the turn in the six path and ran evenly through the lane. THAT'S HISTORY engaged in close early chase three wide then
faded through the turn. SOUL MACHEN gave chase inside and never factored.

Footnotes
C V'S CAMPFIRE settled off the early pace while saving ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and closed to the front past the quarter, lost ground
approaching the top of the stretch but dug in under steady encouragement to hold off the late arrival of C V'S POWERPAK, who raced in the three path the
first turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid with the winner leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, was carried
out toward the head of the lane, dug in to become a close late threat, though, ran out of ground. WEST VIRGINIA PAM rounded the opening turn about the
three path, challenged nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead at the five sixteenths, but was caught past the quarter, raced at the rail on the far
turn and remained close in the upper stretch, though weakened inside the sixteenth pole. DIAMOND TRAIN raced well back saving early ground, bid toward
the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn near the rail then angled to the five path toward the top of the stretch and improved her position. BELLA
FEMMINA rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened on the far turn. CLUBIN TILL DAWN took over
toward the three quarter pole and rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was caught at the five sixteenths and faded
readily at the rail.

ZAP MAMA took immediate control to rate the pace, came under pressure past the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and dug in under
steady stretch handling. MOLLY BOLTS raced well off the early pace about the four path, eased out into the backstretch and bid approaching the seven
sixteenths pole, steadily progressed in the three path of the far turn, came along for second later yards and was gaining on the winner. BOTTLE COURAGE
saved ground off the pace, bid approaching the three eighths pole and raced in range of the lead off the rail on the far turn, flattened stride leaving the
eighth pole then gave up second later yards. CHERISH YOUR DREAM stalked off the rail early then dropped back through the second turn, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then weakened. TURKISH ANGEL raced off the pace about the four path and showed little
response. KATIE FALOONA came through the opening turn in the four path, stalked from the three quarter pole and gave chase past the nine sixteenths,
but faded down the backstretch. BORROWED ANGEL stalked three wide early then faded on the second turn.

NICE N' BROAD chased two deep, drew close nearing the top of the stretch and dug in under steady encouragement to take the nod the final strides.
GOOD KARMA angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, dug in to steady stretch encouragement but
was nipped the final strides. THREE BOPS chased toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn and finished well. UNDENIABLE TOUCH chased, rounded
the turn off the rail then flattened out. SUNDAY IN L B C gave chase and came through the turn about the three path then passed a rival in the lane.
WINDSOR'S CHAMPION chased the early pace toward mid track, raced in the four path of the turn and showed little more. DISTORTED SPLENDOR gave
chase and rounded the turn about the five path. GREEK SONNET gave chase toward mid track and never factored.

Footnotes
WEAVING YOU BEHIND rated a slim lead inside, dug in to pressure leaving the three eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn,
drew clear in the upper stretch and held on well with steady handling. ROCKET COLONY rounded the first turn in the three path then bid approaching the
three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dropped back past the eighth pole, though held on for second. COCKY
WINCHILL hopped at the break and raced well off the early pace while saving ground the first turn, eased out with a bid into the backstretch, ran five wide
on the far turn and was gaining late on the runner-up. EMPEROR PENGUIN rated close through the opening turn then picked up the chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and ran evenly through the lane. ASK ME HOW IKNOW settled off the early pace and off the rail,
gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, angled to the four path toward the top of the lane then flattened stride. ANOTHER MOVE stalked two deep then
challenged toward the three eighths pole, engaged in close chase most of the backstretch then faded off the rail on the far turn. SUN AND SALT was
hustled toward contention early and rounded the opening turn about the four path, though, showed little response through the backstretch.
