Footnotes
RUSSIAN ROULETTE broke readily, angled inwards dictating the pace on a narrow margin, forged clear entering the turn, then steadily widened the
advantage under pressure. MY GIRL ANNIE tracked off the first flight three wide in early stages, was prompted to gain position racing in the four path
through the turn to upper stretch and edged a rival for the place honors. INEDATEQUILA, in touch attending a rival's pace racing to the turn, faded into the
stretch. SHALL RETURN tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and faded nearing the lane. MARMALADE tracked just off the first flight inside
rivals racing to the turn and gave way into upper stretch. PLUIE D'AVRIL settled last, raced wide into the turn and proved no threat.

Footnotes
DRAPES was urged between foes to gain a forward placing attending a rival's pace to the backstretch, was urged to challenge for command in tandem with
several rivals leaving the midway point of the far turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage while angling inside entering the lane and held sway to the end
under firm encouragement. JEAN V'S LEGACY broke out, bumping STREAKING GREY, was righted to track off the second flight outside foes to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance while caught five wide nearing upper stretch challenging for command, then edged rivals for the place honors while
failing to match the winner. TREASURE TAILS switched outside rivals racing to the backstretch tracking off the second flight, was prompted to advance four
wide between foes on the far turn, was taken up out of close quarters nearing upper stretch, then shifted out five wide entering the lane while producing a
second effort to regain some position while prevailing for a share. TAKE TO THE SKIES tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening half, shifted
out to bid for command three deep between foes nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. BUNNY PRINCESS was rated well off the leaders
along the inside to the backstretch, switched out racing into upper stretch and made an effort to gain some position four wide between foes late.
CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight, was urged to lodge a brief bid between foes nearing upper stretch but came up
empty in the drive. STREAKING GREY, bumped at the start, was quickly righted while angling to the inside early, pulling a bit against restraint tracking off
the second flight but couldn't produce a closing response. FYVIE, urged to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and
gave out abruptly racing into upper stretch. AGELESS ARTIST proved no factor.

Footnotes
BOURBON TAN, held up out of tight quarters at the start, settled last racing to the backstretch, gradually gathered momentum racing into the far turn while
shifting to the outside, split foes five wide entering upper stretch and rallied to the front in time under firm handling. D'CRAZINESS, angled to the inside
tracking the leaders inside rivals in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch briefly awaiting an opening, came through along the rail to challenge for
command leaving midstretch but was just outkicked. IMPERIAL BREW, reserved off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted
outside foes nearing upper stretch to bid five wide for command midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair. CANDY COVE switched off the inside tracking
off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, was urged to advance when presented an opening three wide between foes nearing upper stretch
but had no final kick. ENGLISH LAUGHTER broke outwards bumping BOURBON TAN, was rated well off the leaders to the backstretch, was fanned six
wide leaving the far turn and offered, no rally. HERECOMESYOURMAN, off a bit slowly, raced unhurried along the inside to the far turn, switched out
entering the lane but lacked a rally. MY COWBOY, urged to terms with the first flight three wide prompting the pace to the backstretch, dueled for command
outside a rival through the far turn into upper stretch and gave way. NOTORIOUS NICK was urged between foes prompting the pace to the backstretch,
dueled for command inside rivals on the far turn into the lane and gave way. SIESTA MOON tracked off the first flight outside foes to the backstretch, was
prompted to lodge a brief, three wide bid on the far turn, drifted out markedly nearing upper stretch and quickly gave way. CALL ME HANDSOME, urged
inside foes pressing the pace to the backstretch, was through after a half.

Footnotes
FLAMING INDY broke sharply, was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin, widened the advantage into upper stretch and held sway
to the end under firm encouragement. PLAY THE MAX, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter from the outset to the stretch, proved only second best.
PURPLE SCOOTER, forwardly placed three wide between foes racing to the turn, continued willingly in that path to close the gap on the top pair. MI
CLEOPATRA AND I, urged to contend four wide tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance racing to the turn, continued evenly in that path into
the lane. RISEN CHANGE hopped at the start, settled into stride, switched out five wide racing into the lane but offered no rally. DRILL'S VALENTINE
angled to the inside early tracking off the first flight racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. ARNOLD'S PATSY trailed throughout.

Footnotes
EXCHEQUER, caught four wide between foes racing into the first turn while prompted to contend, continued with a steady gain racing three deep into the
far turn to challenge for command nearing upper stretch and edged clear late under firm handling. IRISH VALOR was rated along the inside in the last flight
racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced inside foes racing into the far turn, switched out four wide entering upper stretch and continued with interest to
close the gap while edging a rival for the place honors late. LITTLE MAZZY, urged inside rivals prompting the pace to the backstretch, pressed the issue
gaining a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid to late stages but yielded to the top pair late. PLATO, caught five wide racing
into the first turn while being prompted to contend, raced outside foes in the last flight on the backstretch, then continued willingly three deep between foes
in the closing stages to improve position. TOUPHA, reserved between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, dropped out last after a half, was
prompted to advance while angling to the rail nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. NEW JERSEY JOHN, urged between foes forcing the
pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch. PRAETORIAN briefly contested the pace three wide between foes to the backstretch but
faded after a half.

Footnotes
SCHATZI was reserved while angling nearer the inside racing to the first turn dropping well off the second flight, switched outside foes nearing the far turn
while steadily gathering momentum, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch continuing with a steady late response to wrest a clear advantage under
firm encouragement. THREE COINS tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the
pacesetter in tandem with SUNNYMEDE DREAM on the far turn, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch, then was floated out contesting the issue past
midstretch but couldn't contain the winner while edging a rival for the place honors late. SUNNYMEDE DREAM, forwardly placed tracking just off the
pacesetter racing to the backstretch, conceded some position under patient handling racing to the second bend, advanced along the rail on the far turn to
challenge for command inside the pacesetter nearing upper stretch, drifted out leaving midstretch disputing the issue but couldn't contain the top pair.
ANDIAMA tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but had no late bid. NANIE'S TREASURE sprinted to the lead
racing to the first turn, opened a comfortable advantage racing a bit off the rail into the far turn, but gave out between foes entering upper stretch. DINNER
FOR TWO worked her way to the inside early but never gained contention. LA GUATEMALTECA tracked the leaders outside rivals in the second flight to
the backstretch but faded after a half. J'S BAILEY ANN, held up out of tight quarters when bumped at the start, failed to menace thereafter. LADY MIDAS
broke inwards bumping J'S BAILEY ANN, was settled last to the backstretch and proved no threat. JUST LIKE INDY was firmly rated to drop off the second
flight along the inside racing to the first turn and retreated early.

Footnotes
NICOLE MUNNINGS was urged to dispute the pace inside foes racing well off the rail in the opening quarter, dueled for command in the two path racing
into the turn, edged clear racing into upper stretch and just maintained the advantage to the end under firm right handed pressure. ROLLER angled to the
inside tracking off the first flight racing through the backstretch, steadily gained position along the rail entering the lane, then switched outside the leader to
close the gap nearing the wire. THE GREAT LOUDINI tracked off the second flight between foes racing into the turn and continued with an even effort three
deep between rivals to prevail for a share in the closing stages. ONE STOP SHOP settled along the inside dropping well off the leaders on the backstretch,
saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position. AMERICA'S SIMMARD, bumped, then forced in just after the start, switched
outside rivals racing into the turn and continued with some late interest to gain position five wide in the closing stages. BEYOND STREETSMART tracked
the leaders outside rivals in second flight, was prompted to advance four wide to upper stretch and flattened out in the drive. CIRCLE AWAY settled outside
foes in early stages and failed to menace thereafter. OSKAR BLUES, urged forcing the pace outside the eventual winner racing into the turn, gave way into
upper stretch. FIVE STAR CREEK swerved early bumping AMERICA'S SIMMARD, was held up while dropping out last and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DENY angled to the inside while being urged to dispute the pace leaving the chute, forged clear racing into the turn, opened a commanding advantage and
was kept to firm left handed pressure. NO RENOVATIONS, forwardly placed four wide tracking just off the first flight, was prompted in pursuit of the leader
in the three path through the turn to upper stretch and proved best of the others. TINKER'S PAL tracked off the second flight racing to the turn, raced four
wide to upper stretch and continued well enough to gain a share. SUNNY SAINT, unhurried between foes racing to the turn, was prompted to improve
position three wide between foes late. VILLAGE PREACHER tracked off the second flight between foes, angled five wide nearing upper stretch and
continued evenly. NEW SOUTH tracked off the second flight three wide between foes racing to the turn and faded into the stretch. ODESSA GOLD, held up
avoiding tight quarters in the opening stages, passed only tiring rivals. IMMERSION tracked off the second flight inside foes and faded into the stretch.
BLAZING ISLAND proved no factor. NOT INVENTED HERE angled to the inside early tracking the leaders in second flight but gave way nearing the lane.
NELSON LEGEND, urged prompting a rival's pace, gave way early.

LORD EDDARD STARK tracked the leaders in second flight outside foes in the opening half, advanced four wide on the turn to upper stretch, shifted about
under pressure entering the lane but continued with a sustained response to wrest a clear advantage late under right handed pressure. DREAMING OF
GERRY, urged disputing the pace inside rivals racing a bit off the rail, went clear entering the turn, held sway past midstretch but failed to sustain his
momentum. TESTIMONY TIME, a bit unruly in the post parade, tracked off the second flight in early stages, gained position between foes racing into the
turn, angled to the rail racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share. MCRAGS switched outside rivals when appearing to dislike
the kickback in the opening stages, continued five wide into the turn to upper stretch and gained some position in an even effort. PERFECT SILENT CAT,
forwardly placed between foes in the opening quarter, dropped out last racing into the turn, then produced a second effort switching outside foes entering
the lane to regain some position. CANDENZA joined the pace three wide racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes to the turn and
gave way. LAST INVESTMENT settled outside foes early and failed to menace. MOMENT OF SILENCE, urged between foes prompting the pace, pressed
the pacesetter into the turn and gave way after a half. RESIST THE DEVIL tracked off the second flight along the inside, was prompted to advance nearing
the turn but faded early. AGENT MULGANNON proved no factor.
