Footnotes
BODENSEE chased the pace four wide into the turn, continued in the three path through the turn and into the lane, took aim at the leader after straightening
then determinedly inched up on that one and was up in time. BARBALOOT set the pace while near the inside through the turn, shook clear entering the
lane, widened the advantage inside the eighth pole then could not hole the winner safe. SHARP JUSTICE chased the pace from the three path through the
turn, entered the lane from the three or four path, drifted into the rail inside the eighth pole and finished evenly. CARLEXA was in the two path through the
turn and into the lane then moved up while not a serious threat. NO KITTEN was three wide and a serious contender through the turn and into the lane then
faded after straightening. GLOBAL QUEEN COCO chased the pace from the inside into the lane then was empty.

Footnotes
DULCIMER DAME settled behind pacesetters through the turn while in the four path, bid five wide nearing the quarter pole, gained the lead when
straightening in the lane then drew off through the final eighth. CUPP OF CLASS stalked the pace four wide through the turn, came into the lane a serious
contender, was passed from the outside by the winner, could not keep up with that one through the final eighth but kept on well to be clear for the place
spot. PABLO'S MINX was in the three path and two wide through the turn, was a contender when straightening but lacked a closing kick. CARRY ON was in
the two or three path through the turn when never far back, angled into the six path for the drive and moved up while not a threat. ANCHORETTE set the
early pace while in the two path, chased the pacesetter into the lane then was empty. WHATAROCKET steadied at the start, angled to the inside and
rushed up through an open rail down the backstretch, gained the lead into the turn, continued on the lead while racing near the inside then was empty after
entering the lane. OXBOWINDY was always outrun while off the inside.

DARK HONEY vied for the early lead while in the three or two path, cleared into the turn, remained on a clear lead into the lane, was shook up when
straightening and drew off while being ridden out. WIN OR CELLAR chased the pace from the three path through the turn, was no match for the winner
while finishing well clear of the show rival. PIONEER'S CANDY was in the two path through the turn, was asked before the quarter pole and kept on to gain
the show spot while not a threat. KHOZYS CROWN vied for the lead early on, relinquished the lead to chase the winner through the turn then faded after
entering the lane. BE PATIENT was never a factor while in the four path through the turn.

NINJA KITTEN pressed the pace three wide through the turn, bid two wide into the lane, edged to the front and held on gamely. MISS BETTE LUTE was
unhurried early while off the inside, came into the lane from the three or four path, moved to the winner near the eighth pole then could not get past while
well clear off the next rival. SPEIGHTY SHIRL set the pace from the two path, came into the lane with a short lead then could not hold the top two safe.
MEADOWBROOK ROAD raced in the two path through the turn and raced evenly through the lane. BEACHSIDE BUNNY was near the inside through the
turn, came out into the five path for the drive and never was a serious threat. A MERRY PRANKSTER was close up along the inside through the turn then
weakened. WANTA BALLERINA never a factor while in the three path. PERTINACIOUS TIZ was outrun while saving ground.

SKY JUDGE vied for the lead two wide into the turn, gained the lead entering the turn and cleared soon after, remained on a clear lead into the lane,
dropped closer to the inside and continued clear to the eighth pole and was not seriously threatened thereafter. STRONG WORDS chased the pace from
the three path through the turn, bid into the lane and appeared to be a serious threat then could not gain further and settled for second best. CIELO BLU
was in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path, drifted in nearing the sixteenth pole and stayed on to gain the minor share.
AMAZING TIZCAT vied for the early lead into the far turn, continued in close contact into the lane then weakened. THUNDERBOLT ZEUS was never a
menace while in the four path through the turn. ROYAL ICING steadily faded while along the inside. RED LICORICE was off slowly and spotted the field
several lengths, raced in the two path through the turn and was never in it. DADDY'S BACK was done after a half from the inside. LITTLE JOHN COLONY

Footnotes
PERUVIAN BOY was unhurried while three wide through the turn, moved into the lane from the four path, caught the leaders under minor urging then
quickly cleared and was kept to the task to the end. SECRETARY AT WAR vied for the lead three wide through the turn, gained a short lead with a furlong
to run then was no match for the winner. DILETTANTE was off awkwardly, raced along the inside through the turn and into the lane then needed more late.
BOOM FIVE THOUSAND raced close up through the turn, gained a short lead entering the lane then weakened after straightening in the lane. MUSIC TO
MY EARS vied for the lead two wide and between rivals through the turn then weakened in the drive. NIAGARA CHARLIE was never a factor while saving
ground. ROUGHIN THE CITY vied for the lead three wide early then faded.

Footnotes
SHY MONEY settled early, moved through the three path into the turn, gained quickly on the leaders, gained the lead leaving the turn then quickly cleared
and was ridden out to the end while not under a threat. DANCE MONEY was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, gained momentum once
straightened and finished fastest of all to be clear for the place spot. STRONG ILLUSION raced in the four path through the turn and into the lane, moved
closest to the winner with an eighth to go but could not stay with that one and kept on to be best of the rest. EXPRESS LADY was in the four or five path
through the turn and into the lane and never was a serious threat. AMERICA RULES was in the two path through the turn, angled into the seven path for the
drive and showed late interest through the final eighth. STARLET EXPRESS set the early pace while under pressure then gave way entering the lane. MISS
DEPUTY STAR was close up for three-eighths while near the inside then faded. BEAUTILICIOUS raced in the five to the four through the turn when never a
factor. FRENCH VANILLA was close up into the lane then was empty. PORKETTA steadily faded while in the two path. NATTY NORA was never a factor
from the inside.
