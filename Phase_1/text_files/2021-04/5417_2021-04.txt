Footnotes
BLACK KAT TAPS off a step slow, raced back, rallied three wide out of the final turn, drifted out briefly under a left handed crop with a furlong remaining,
was straightened and closed with good resolve to be up in time. CREATIVE LEGACY moved out to be three wide in the first turn, raced unhurried the
middle half, remained in the three path when advancing on the leader late in the final turn, collared that one a took over from the outside inside the furlong
grounds, led late, could not contain the winner, well clear of the rest. CHEWY CHEWY GOOD away in good order, vied past the wire the first time, was clear
before quarter, showed the way up the backstretch under restraint, continued to hold a daylight advantage second turn, narrowly showed the way past the
furlong marker, weakened when headed late, saved the show. AREEMAA went one paced throughout while saving ground, no late punch.
DADDYMADEMEDOIT raced back, was fanned four wide into the lane when moving a bit, flattened out in the drive. UNEXPLAINABLE closest to the leader
for five furlongs, gave way abruptly in the far turn, quickly fell back, jogged in.

CATHOLIC GUILT broke alertly, got clear through the first turn, dueled into and through the final turn, clear again, stretch, enough left to hold the next two
safe late. HANDY settled off the pace and the inside, moved a bit closer far turn, saw that progress stall a bit late in that bend while in some traffic, two path
into the lane, switched to the far outside and was rapidly getting to the winner late. QUARTERBACK DAK last to leave, moved outside, three wide into the
far turn, loomed a threat four wide turning into the stretch, flattened out in the drive, lost the place late. ENGLANDER chased the winner early, dueled
outside the winner the middle half mile, weakened in the drive. VASARIANO away in good order, forwardly placed in the early going, had little left for the
drive. FIRST RATE broke back, trailed throughout in failing to menace.

Footnotes
ASH FLAT broke in good order, sprinted clear in the two path, maintained daylight through the turn, not seriously threatened through the lane while being
kept to task. HONIARA behind the pace outside, came four wide out of the turn, rallied on the outside for the place, not a serious threat to the winner.
MAJOR CHANCE chased the winner in the three path up the backstretch, could not keep with that one into and through the stretch, caught late for the place
spot. BANDY'S MAP saved ground to no avail in turning in an even effort. SUPER WISE lacked early foot, four wide into the turn, dropped toward the inside
midway on the turn, lacked a closing kick. MYSTIC PHAROAH lacked early foot, three wide through the turn, made little impact through the stretch. LOW
TIDE WARNING off a step slow, remained back.

Footnotes
MOON IN THE SKY behind the pace, shifted out late first turn, three wide into the far turn, fell back off the dueling leaders midway on that bend, roused,
altered course to the outside past the furlong marker, finished well to win going away at the end. CYBER MONDAY sprinted clear to be well clear in the first
turn, showed the way up the backstretch in hand, allowed a rival the inside into the far turn, dueled with that foe through the second turn, briefly regained the
advantage from that with a furlong remaining, proved no match for the winner late, continued to hold sway for the place. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY dropped inside
in the first turn, closer along the rail before a half, put a head in front far turn, dueled into the stretch, weakened, comfortably saved the show. RIANTE SKY
dwelt at the start, continued to lag far back, trailed into the far turn, five wide into the lane when advancing, continued to improve position while not a serious
threat. MY FORTUNATE SON settled in mid pack while four wide through the first turn, moved down to the two path for the second bend, went evenly
through the stretch. UNBRIDLED SHOES chased the runner up through the first turn in the three path, fell back the middle half, swung out to be four wide
for the drive, also went one paced through the stretch to finish up one paced. HEROS R COWBOYS five wide into the first turn, raced back, two path
second turn, failed to rally as well. CYBER SHOES in the second flight early, continued in mid pack up the backstretch, backed up in the drive. HADLEYS
HERO remained always back.

Footnotes
DERBY CODE broke with the field, raced back, swept up with a five wide move late in the final turn, put a head in front when widest of the first flight when
straightened for home, drew clear. ALLEN within striking distance off the inside, advanced and challenged three wide midway on the final turn, vied with the
winner upper stretch, could not match that one the final furlong, determined for the place. CABERTOSS settled along the inside within striking distance,
angled out in traffic four wide turning for home, in tight quarters past the furlong marker, outkicked for the place. MAJOR ATTRACTION broke with the field,
spurted well clear late in the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch in hand, offered brief resistance when challenged by the runner up late in the final
turn, faltered when headed by that one into the lane, continued to gradually weaken in the run to the wire. URBANITE settled off the pace and the inside,
raced four wide through the final turn, lacked a serious closing response. ROAR OF THE LION forwardly placed and inside, swung out five wide into the
stretch, failed to muster a closing response. BULLION closest to the early leader inside, fell back, in traffic and three wide late in the final turn, steadied, fell
back and failed to respond. JUSTIN'S QUEST finished after a half, fell back, vanned off after the wire. CARTE BLANCHE trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE TIPSY raced behind the pace while racing outside, came five wide out of the turn, set down, finished with good energy to win going away
midtrack. ROCK CITY ROCKET within striking distance off the inside, raced three wide when moving slightly closer in the turn, proved no match for the
winner in the drive, edged clear for the place. MY LITTLE TIP in the second flight while along the inside, saved ground turn, along for the show while not a
serious threat to the top pair. BRASKA off a step slow, raced back and inside, improved position up the rail while also never a serious factor. STOMPING
HOTROD moved up after the start to set the pace inside, showed the way through the turn, gave way when headed by the winner into the stretch. MACHO
ROCKET MAN in mid pack while off the inside, failed to muster a rally. DRIVER pressed the issue off the inside, backed up in the drive. RUBIGINOUS off
slow, four out to five wide through the turn, remained back to always be outrun. GENTLE KNIGHT off slowly, pulled up soon after, vanned off.

Footnotes
BATTLE BLING set the pace toward the in side, shrugged off a foe turning for home as that one was getting out, maintained a daylight advantage to the
wire under steady handling. MARION FRANCIS settled off the pace toward the inside, began to advance far turn, floated out to be six wide into the lane,
finished willingly to be well clear for the place, slowly getting to the runner up. DREAM PRINCESS thrashed then broke in the air to spot the field a few
lengths, raced back, three wide into the lane, some traffic past the furlong marker, rallied for the show. WEST SIDE GIRL within striking distance while
racing along the inside, came up empty for the drive. ABSOLUTE ANNA lacked speed, continued back while off the inside, four wide turning for home, failed
to menace. CODE NAME KATE pressed the leader from the outside early, dueled the middle part, got out turning for home and gave way. ZOOM UP lacked
speed, was never a threat.

Footnotes
CANDURA in the second flight early inside, traffic late in the turn, shifted out slightly, split foes past the furlong marker, dueled the final eighth, proved game
in the final strides to prevail. TRUE CASTLE forwardly placed while well off the inside, three wide into the stretch when moving to challenge, put a head in
front nearing midstretch, dueled to the wire outside the winner, outfinished in the late going. COMPELLING SMILE void of early foot while along the inside,
angled out to be five wide into the lane, finished with good energy to be up for the show while closing the gap on the top two. CLICKBAIT back off the pace
and the inside, four wide into the lane, mild interest, not enough for the show. PERFECT HAPPINESS sprinted well clear after the start, continued to show
the way by daylight early turn, faltered when headed by the top two when straightened for home, gave way. READY TO RUNAWAY forwardly placed in the
second flight just off the inside, gave way in the drive.

MOCHA KISS lacked speed toward the inside, began a steady advance in the two path far turn, collared the leader into the stretch, kicked clear under
steady handling. JAMES'S MOONSHINE broke on top, dueled early off the inside, shook clear before a half, saved ground second turn, responded when
the winner came alongside late in the final bend, dueled upper stretch, proved no match for that one in the late going, clearly second best. EAST MOON
LAKE settled in midpack into the first turn inside, moved off the rail a bit onto the backstretch, improved through the second turn and into the lane, had little
for the top two in the drive. LISTEN TO ROSE void of speed, lagged in trailing for six furlongs, angled out to be six wide when advancing into the lane,
continued to pick off a few rivals while well out in the strip, too late for the top three. DESTINEDTOBEASTAR void of speed just off the inside, three wide
into the lane, also improved with some mild, belated interest. ARLINGTON'S SHINE broke back, raced outside, five wide far turn while remaining in mid
pack, three wide into the lane, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. EGOMANIAC four wide into the first turn, remained outside, four
to five wide through the second bend, lacked a closing response. CINCO CATALINA dueled early inside the runner up, chased the middle half mile, gave
way in the drive. TROPHY DADDY off a step slow, moved up to mid pack early, backed up after a half. KAT'S HITMAN in the second flight while three wide,
gave way.
