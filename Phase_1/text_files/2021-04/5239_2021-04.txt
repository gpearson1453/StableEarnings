Footnotes
KUKULKAN took quick control of a clear pace, widened on the turn and increased his lead under steady stretch urging. FIFTY FIFTY chased toward the
outside, raced in the four path of the turn and settled for second best. FIRST CLASS FLIRT gave chase inside, raced near the rail on the turn and showed
little more. ONE BAD KAT chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn and proved empty in the lane. STRONG SAFETY became a bit edgy in the gate,
broke a step slow and rounded the turn in the five path. TWISTED SUNSET gave chase outside and raced in the six path of the turn.

Footnotes
BINN GOODE angled to the inside, drew clear toward the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, widened at
the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled down the lane. KATMAN QUICK settled close about the three path, picked up the chase approaching the
three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, though, settled for second best. WISH IN THE CASTLE raced in the four path the opening turn and
settled close into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, maintained the four path on the far turn and was along for third later yards.
FEISTY AND SASSY came through the opening turn about the three path and settled just off the pace into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, steadied in tight while still at the rail toward the eighth pole and flattened stride. SET'EM UP JOE raced off the rail the
first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, showed little response and rounded the far turn about the six path.

CHOCO ROCO settled off the rail the opening turn and rated close into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep at the
quarter, drew clear while drifting toward the top of the stretch, lugged in through the upper lane, widened and was in hand later yards. MADDEYE MOODY

and dug in to take second later yards. TWENTYTWENTY rated close inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, then
flattened inside the eighth pole. CATFISH contested the pace through the front stretch then rated in front into the first turn, came under pressure nearing the
three eighths pole, was met at the rail at the quarter pole, dropped back toward the top of the stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. CAYATANO came
through the first turn in the three path and raced well off the pace entering the backstretch, bid past the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn
and showed little more. ALLOVERBUTTHECRYIN saved ground well off the pace, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then rounded the far turn
at the rail. STRONG LIL KOKORO contested the pace through the front stretch then drifted into the first turn, raced outside into the backstretch, picked up

LADY VALENTINA quickly took over and rated the early pace inside, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn
and was steadily handled through the lane. WEDDING DAY KITTEN saved ground well off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved
near the rail on the far turn, then dug in to take second past the sixteenth pole. PIMM AND PROPER settled just off the early pace inside, bid past the three
eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. COMPLETE SURPRISE stalked two deep the first turn,
picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened the final furlong. C'EST MARDI raced well off the early
pace while saving ground, bid approaching the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the three path and showed little further. COOL MO came
through the opening turn in the three path, showed little response down the backstretch and ran in the five path of the far turn. SHE GIVES ME FITS raced
in the four path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded in the three path of the far turn. BOOM BOOM GONE was not a

came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, drifted into the stretch and was steadily
encouraged through the lane, but gave up the nod at the wire. WINNING SCHOLAR stalked from the three path then challenged toward the seven
sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep while between horses on the far turn, drifted toward the top of the lane then flattened the final
sixteenth. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE was shuffled back early and raced well off the pace while saving ground, eased out with a bid toward the seven
sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five path then flattened later yards. EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR rated close to the early pace, picked up the
chase toward the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, angled to the five path into the stretch but flattened stride. ELOQUENCE checked
into the first turn and raced in the four and five paths of the first two turns, then showed little response down the backstretch. BLAZED UP stalked the earlier
