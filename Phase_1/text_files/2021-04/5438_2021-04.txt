was joined soon after by the winner, stayed with that one to inside the eighth pole then could not keep up but kept on to save the place spot.
BEAUTILICIOUS was put in tight soon after the start, steadied and settled back along the rail, continued to trail the short field into the lane then finished with
good energy while along the rail but had to settle for the show spot. NATTY NORA vied for the lead three wide through the turn, continued to duel for the top
spot into the lane then was empty after straightening. FRENCH VANILLA vied for the lead between rivals into the turn, was steadied slightly when in tight
near the seven-sixteenths pole, moved into the four path in late turn, entered the lane from the six path and was done. The half-mile time was omitted due to
a timer malfunction.

Footnotes
BOW MAKER broke outward and bumped rival, moved to press the pace two wide into the far turn, bid near the three-eighths pole, went with another into
the lane while near the two path, shook clear of that one outside the eighth pole and widened to the wire. LILIBET was bumped at the start, moved to stalk
the pacesetters down the backstretch and into the far turn, bid three wide near the three-eighths pole, dueled with the winner into the lane then could not
keep up while settling for second best. THIRST TRAP was unhurried while near the inside, came into the lane from the three path and offered a mild gain for
the show spot. THREE BIRDS was along the inside throughout and never was a factor. CLAIRESSENCE was in the two or three path through the far turn,
moved into the lane from the four path then flattened inside the eighth pole. CUTIE PIE set the pace along the inside into the far turn, was headed in
mid-turn and was done soon after. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF #4 LILIBET AGAINST THE RIDER OF #3 BOW MAKER FOR INTERFERENCE
NEAR THE QUARTER POLE WAS DISALLOWED.

JOSIE set the pace from the outset, raced on a clear advantage while in the two path, came into the lane from the three or four path, was shook up with the
reins once straightened then ridden out while not ever seriously threatened. FOLLY stalked the pace from the three path through the far turn, bid into the
lane from the four path, could not gain on the top one but kept on well to be well clear for the place spot. SPARTANKA was in the three path through the far
turn, asked coming into the lane, could not gain on the top ones and finished well clear for the show spot. OXUM POWER tracked the pace along the inside
through the far turn then lacked a response. KIMBERLEY DREAM was never a factor while near the rail.

no late bids. PASSING ON BY broke sharply, stalked in the three path, then gave way in the stretch. RODSSILVEROAK stumbled hard and was bumped at

Footnotes
MUSIC TO MY EARS chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, caught the leader inside the eighth pole, cleared
and widened to the end. GAWKIER pressed the pace two wide into the turn, gained a short lead in late turn, continued on the front end inside the eighth
pole, was no match for the winner then was all out to just save the place spot. PASS THE BISCUITS was in the four path through the turn and into the lane
when never far back, stayed on well, was closing in on the place spot and just missed. WING AND WHEEL was in the three or four path through the turn,
came into the lane from the six path and moved up. HERE'S CARLOS was along the inside through the turn, came off the inside after the eighth pole and
needed more. UNSCATHED vied for the lead into the turn, continued close up into the lane then faded. WICKED SLIDER never a factor while in the three
path. DEACON was off awkwardly, raced on the inside into the lane and never was a factor. DOCKTARRI raced in the two path turn and finished tired.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED VICTOR pressed the pace in the three path, bid at the quarter pole to be clear and held sway under steady drive. BENNY BOO BOO was off
awkwardly, stalked the pace between foes, bid but couldn't get to the winner. STRONG WORDS stalked in the four path, bid at the sixteenth pole, then
couldn't close late. ACTUALITY stalked while five wide but had no late bid. BENNY'S LEGACY had a mild late bid inside. SACRED SKY stumbled and was
bumped at the start. STYLISH LIE passed tired runners outside. VICTOR'S SECRET led inside, then faded in the stretch. MY BUCKAROO was not a factor
outside. VICTOR'S MAJESTY stalked inside, then faded in the stretch.
