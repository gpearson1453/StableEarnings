Footnotes
MAMBO DANCER, held up conceding some position four deep between foes in the opening stages, switched out five wide nearing the turn while being
prompted to advance, continued with a steady effort to challenge for command in that path racing into upper stretch and edged forward in time under firm
handling. PASZ THE PEPPER, urged to a forward placing four wide racing to the turn, continued with a steady gain between foes nearing the lane but was
outkicked. TEE UP angled inwards while moving to wrest the advantage after the opening furlong, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage between foes
into the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch remaining a bit off the inside but weakened in the drive. MI TIA CHRISTINA tracked off the first flight in
early stages, was prompted to gain position between foes midway through the turn, lost some momentum when racing in tight quarters past the quarter mile
marker and had no final bid. HEATHER HILLS switched outside the pacesetter in the opening stages, prompted that foe three wide into the turn between
rivals and faded in late stages. OURHANDSOMEGAL settled outside foes and never gained contention. INFINITY SKY proved no threat. PINK MAMA broke
sharply to gain a brief advantage nearest the rail, tracked the pacesetter along the inside into the turn, lost some momentum when caught in tight quarters
nearing upper stretch, came up empty entering the lane and was vanned off the course after the race. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF MI TIA
CHRISTINA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY BUT NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
VILLAGE PREACHER, caught five wide racing through the first turn, settled out of striking distance on the backstretch, commenced a steady advance four
wide racing into the far turn and continued with a sustained response to just collar IMMERSION in time under firm handling. The latter was urged to the lead
racing to the first turn a bit off the rail, held sway on a comfortable margin to midstretch and just missed. ROGUE RAGE raced four wide between foes to the
backstretch, continued to make steady progress three wide racing into upper stretch but had no final kick. VALEROSO, urged to a forward placing tracking
just off the pacesetter racing to the first turn, continued in pursuit of that rival to upper stretch and gave way. BLAZING ISLAND tracked the leaders from just
out of striking distance along the inside, saved ground to the lane and faded late. ODESSA GOLD settled outside foes in the last flight to the backstretch
and passed outside tiring rivals late. CUP GAME settled between foes in the last flight and proved no threat. AND THE OSCAR GOES tracked the leaders
between foes to the backstretch and faded after a half. LUCKY TOM settled along the inside early and proved no threat. ADIOS BOBBY dropped out early.

Footnotes
WOODBINE WAY broke outwards brushing the gate, was urged setting the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail into the turn, then held sway in
that path to the end under firm handling. SHE DAZZLE tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and edged rivals
for the place honors in late stages. FAN FAN, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn, faded in late stages.
MOLLY'S ANGEL, bumped at the start, was settled last, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. NURSE JUDY
broke outwards bumping MOLLY'S ANGEL, was righted to track just off the second flight racing into the turn but had no rally. EAST WING was rated off the
second flight near the inside early, angled five wide entering the lane but proved no threat. MONEY AND HONEY, urged along four wide, then three deep
racing into the turn pursuing the pacesetter to upper stretch, gave way entering the lane.

Footnotes
LUNA QUEEN was urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, shifted out entering the lane and turned back a challenge
leaving midstretch to prevail under brisk handling. BRYCENS GOLD angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, advanced
along the rail to bid inside the pacesetter nearing midstretch but proved no match. WRITTEN IN RED settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled
to the inside nearing the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch gaining position and split foes just off the inside in the closing stages to prevail for a share.
SLEWYS CHOSEN ONE, in touch with the pacesetter attending the pace, pressed the issue into the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way.
MAGIC FINNISH settled off the second flight racing to the backstretch, gained some position three deep between foes nearing the lane, lost momentum
when caught in traffic entering upper stretch, then angled out five wide late. WILD NORTH, reserved while angling inside, shifted out nearing upper stretch,
then continued evenly while angling inside late. REMARKABLE SILVER, urged to a forward placing three wide, tracked off the first flight outside a rival to
the far turn, was prompted to make a brief bid nearing the lane but was empty in the drive. PEARLS FOR JOSIE angled inwards to track off the second flight
between foes and faded in the drive. HOITY TOITY threw her head while breaking slowly and never gained contention. GET BACK HOME settled outside
foes to the backstretch and failed to menace. CHERRY ROCK BRIDGE, urged to contend racing four wide through the first turn to the backstretch, was
spent after a half. BIZ MAKER settled along the inside, dropped back abruptly while falling racing past the seven sixteenths marker and was vanned off the
course. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND THE INCIDENT NEARING THE FAR TURN BUT
TOOK NO ACTION.

CRAFTY CITY, urged inside foes disputing the pace into the turn, shook clear in upper stretch and just lasted in a brisk drive. LA LUISA tracked off the first
flight four wide in early stages, angled to the inside racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap inside foes. GONE DREAMING, urged
three wide prompting the pace, dueled for command outside the winner to the lane and continued grudgingly. PASS THE SALSA tracked off the first flight
along the inside, angled out four wide in upper stretch and steadily faded. MALIBU LIFE, held up along the inside avoiding a fallen rival in the opening
stages, failed to menace thereafter. SUNDANCE PEAK, urged between foes pressing the pace into the turn, gave way abruptly into the lane. LYING
KAREN jumped a fallen rival in early stages and raced wide to the stretch while proving no threat. SCENT OF HEAVEN, held up avoiding a fallen rival in
early stages, trailed the field thereafter. S K FLYER angled inwards just after the start, clipped heels, then fell to the track dislodging her rider and was
vanned off the course. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE BACKSTRETCH BUT

Footnotes
STARSHIP GODDESS was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, angled out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with
a steady late response to wrest command in time under firm hand urging. TROPICAL FROSTY was urged to the lead, then angled to the rail, dictated the
pace on a clear margin past midstretch but was collared nearing the wire. KELCIE'S MANDATE broke slowly, settled between foes to the backstretch,
swung out five wide racing into upper stretch while roused to advance and continued willingly to close the gap. SUGAR BRITCHES angled to the inside
tracking the pacesetter in second flight and continued evenly to late stages. TIZ HERSELF tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch and
continued evenly four wide into the stretch. WHISPERING WANDA, urged to a forward placing three deep, tracked the pacesetter in second flight to the far
turn and emptied out. BOASTFUL CONTESSA passed tiring rivals. OHMYMY, caught four wide racing into the first turn, tracked off the second flight to the
far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. CAPTUREMENOW worked her way to the inside early, but offered no rally. BET YOUR BANKROLL settled
between foes to the backstretch and dropped out early. BONSAI BENNY settled outside foes in the last flight and retreated early.

Footnotes
PHARAOH'S FASHION shifted off the rail setting the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, forged clear on the turn and steadily widened
the margin under firm encouragement. BEASTIE GIRL tracked just off the second flight racing to the turn, shifted in to split foes racing into upper stretch and
continued with interest to edge rivals for a share. LA BELLA VITA tracked the leader three wide in second flight racing into the turn and continued in that
path to the stretch while outkicked for second. TRULY A DREAM angled to the rail in early stages, tracked the pacesetter inside foes in second flight to
upper stretch but faded late. PALOMA MIA tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane but had no rally. SO MOXIE, pinched
back at the start, passed only tiring rivals. SENA THE DUCHESS tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing to the turn but emptied out
early. SOLDAT TEMPTATION dropped out early.

Footnotes
FLEETRIDGE, forwardly placed along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, conceded the lead after a half to track inside the
pacesetter to the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch and produced a solid second effort to wrest the advantage inside the pacesetter in time under
strong handling. DREAMIN OF SEVILLE tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch to bid for
command in late stages and just missed. DISCO'S BRIDGE, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace, edged forward to a clear advantage after half, held
sway into upper stretch but was collared late. RED SORRELL tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, angled out racing into the far
turn to advance four wide into the stretch and continued to make a mild gain. MR. SARCASTIC tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight, shifted out of
close quarters, then was urged between foes on the far turn but lacked the needed final kick while drifting late. YADI tracked the leaders three wide in
second flight, was fanned wide into the lane and faded. EXIT RIGHT broke out bumping at the start, was reserved near the inside early and proved no
threat. HUSBAND IN LAW, bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight along the inside but lacked a rally. PAPA RALPH J settled between foes to the
backstretch and proved no threat. VERY REPLACEABLE settled outside foes and was caught wide throughout. IRISH MAIL settled outside foes racing to
the backstretch faded into the stretch.
