Footnotes
STAR SUNDAE broke well and led field along the rail, entered turn along the inside of rival, shook free from rival late on the turn, and drew off in the stretch,
under steady urging. VIDALIA tracked duo along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the rail on the turn and made bid along the rail in the stretch,
kept to task late and earned second. MADAME JEANETTE contested pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, drifted out three
paths into the stretch and kept on to get edged late for second. SLIGHTLY tracked leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn,
tried to go around drifting out rival and came into the stretch in the four path, and finished up one paced. MISS NAPPER TANDY tracked leaders in between
rivals on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, lost ground throughout the turn and lacked rally in the lane. SECRET OF WAR stalked pace along
the inside, continued to save ground throughout and failed to threaten.
