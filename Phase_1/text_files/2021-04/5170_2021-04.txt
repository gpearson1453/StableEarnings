eighth pole then drew off in the final sixteenth. TIZ SPLENDID NEWS set a clear pace early on, was in the five path into the lane, had the lead overtaken
near the eighth pole and was no match for the winner in the final stages. DIVINE COMEDY raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane and
moved up in the stretch run. ALEXANDRIA chased the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, made a bid in the stretch and weakened late in the stretch
drive. HINDSIGHT was a bit slow at the start and trailed the field early on, raced along the inside into the lane and improved position. BEAUTIFUL
MEMORIES was through after a half and eased down the lane.

Footnotes
GEAR JOCKEY was restless and popped the gate during the pre-start, tracked the pace early along the inside, was steadied slightly near the five sixteenths
pole, stayed along the inside and slipped through entering the lane, took over command once in the stretch, drew clear near the eighth pole, opened up a
clear advantage and held off a fast moving rival at the wire. FALKIRK raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane, was flying
in the final stages but was just too late. FORTUITY was unhurried early on, raced off the rail into the lane, rallied in the stretch with a belated gain in the final
stages. LA LA LAND (IRE) chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch run. SOUNION stalked the pace early
on, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. WIN D'ORO was reserved early on, raced along the three path into the lane with a
mild gain in the stretch. BULLSEYE BUN set the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and faltered late in the stretch. INHALATION (GB) broke
slowly, chased the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but faded late in the drive. BRIEFCASE BULLY was never a threat.
LAKE NAKURU was unprepared and lunged at the start, no factor. AZRAEL tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and empty down the
lane. ROUGHIN THE CITY was through after a half.

Footnotes
SA FORADADA tracked from midpack two to three wide, tipped five wide turning for home, rallied to bid outside of MAGIC QUEST approaching the
sixteenth pole, and edged past that foe late. MAGIC QUEST vied three wide, forged an advantage approaching the furlong grounds, dug in inside of SA
FORADAD passing that marker, and was out-edged by that foe approaching the wire. STAND BY YOU took a significant bump from an outer foe at the
start, trailed, saved ground while advancing around the turn, rallied behind the leaders through midstretch, and chased those rivals home well. CHRISTMAS
POEM stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the trio of leaders entering the lane, brushed the tiring HARD TO ACCESS in the process, but lacked a
kick to produce a bid, and faded through the late stages. BAHAMA MISCHIEF vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened through the
final furlong. SHOSHONI MOON bumped between horses at the start, lied off of the pace three wide around the turn, swung six wide turning for home, but
failed to menace. LOVEMESOMEME lied far off of the pace while caught four wide around the turn, and failed to factor. MINER'S QUEEN set the pace
inside of a pair of pressing foes, but gave way approaching the furlong pole. HARD TO ACCESS chased two wide, shifted four wide turning for home, but
was brushed between horses while fading in upper stretch. DISTORTED VERVE was never involved. ALYDIVA saved ground while tracking from midpack,
but caved through the lane. SUCHADA was done early.

Footnotes
CHASING ARTIE hopped at the start, trailed under patient handling along the inside around the turn, swung six wide in upper stretch, rallied through the
final furlong with a strong late kick under mild urging to stroll past the leader inside the final sixteenth. FAUCI tracked from midpack two wide, loomed
amongst traffic while patiently awaiting racing room right behind the leader through upper stretch, split foes approaching the furlong pole to forge an
advantage passing that marker, but was worn down with little resistance by his stable mate inside the final sixteenth. UNITEDANDRESOLUTE lied forwardly
placed three to four wide, chased outside of the leaders through midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival before proving best of the rest.
BLAMEWORTHY came in at the start, lied far off of the pace in the two path, and improved without threatening. LOOKIN FOR LOKI saved ground off of the
pace, shifted five wide in upper stretch, but hung his left lead thereafter, and failed to make a bid. BODENHEIMER pressed along the inside, shifted outside
of his outer counterpart passing the half mile pole, stalked that foe from that outside around the turn, bid in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner foe
at the furlong grounds, and faded. J C'S CHAMP lied off of the pace three wide, and failed to factor. LOCK UP set the pace two wide, cleared passing the
half mile pole, shifted off of the rail entering the lane, and weakened in midstretch. SMOKIN' JAY chased from the two path, then along the inside around the
turn, but was put to tight quarters along rail approaching the furlong pole, and faltered.

Footnotes
TWENTY CARAT pressed the pace three wide, forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, and held sway safely through
the final furlong from an inner chasing SLUMBER PARTY. SLUMBER PARTY was void of early speed without incident at the start, advanced under her own
power to an inside stalking position into the turn, got mildly shuffle back behind the tiring leader at the five sixteenths pole, shifted to the three path entering
the lane after TWENTY CARAT kicked clear, then chased that foe from along the inside through the final furlong. AMALFI PRINCESS stalked from the two
path, shifted to the four path turning for home while failing to keep pace with the eventual winner, then kept on thereafter for a minor share. LADY
TRAVELER trailed the field in the four path around the turn, and improved for a minor reward through the late stages. FARSIGHTED vied two wide and from
between horses, got outmoved by her outer foe turning for home, held chasing position through upper stretch, but gave way at the furlong grounds. CILLA
failed to factor. MY GIRL RED rushed along the inside after a bit of a flat-footed start, set the pace inside of a pair of pressing rivals, but weakened at the
five sixteenths pole, and was eased through the lane.

SCARLETT SKY sat well reserved at the rear of the field, swung six wide into the lane, rallied outside of foes through the late stages, and got up
approaching. PALAZZI rated far off of the pace two wide, swung five wide into the lane, rallied inside of SCARLETT SKY through the final furlong to produce
a late bid, but was outfinished by that foe. FIRE AT WILL set a soft pace along the inside under mild pressure from an outer rival, inched clear in upper
stretch, dug in as BARRISTER TOM made a mild rail bid at the furlong pole, shrugged off that rival approaching the sixteenth pole, but had little resistance
for a pair of outer oncharging foes in the late stages. BARRISTER TOM stalked along the inside, attempted a bid inside of the pace settter passing the
furlong pole, but flattened out at the sixteenth marker. EARLS ROCK (IRE) was off slowly, inched forward to a stalking position outside of the pace setter
into the first turn, but faltered between horses entering the lane. BREADMAN tracked from midpack three wide, gained turning for home to attempt a mild
bid, but flattened out in upper stretch, and weakened between horses at the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
ILLIOGAMI lied at the rear of the field along the inside, gained mildly in hand while tipping off of the rail around the far turn, swung four wide entering the
lane, and rallied to reach the tiring leader approaching the wire. PRECIPITATE set the pace along the inside, drew clear turning for home, held that clear
margin in the late stages, but was nailed on the wire by an outer rallying rival. QUEEN BOURBON tracked from midpack along the inside, gained two to
three wide and from between horses around the far turn to achieve place entering the lane, but only managed to chase the leader home while not matching
strides with an outer counterpart. TEMPER MINT TWIST lied off of the pace two wide, got caught four to five wide around the far turn, and improved for a
minor share. SUKI trailed two wide early on, then improved past tiring foes through the lane without menacing. WAITING ON WILLIAM was never involved.
BE LIKE WATER was fractious in the gate, threw her rider and required to be backed out pre-race, then tracked three wide, but faded around the far turn.
CHIONE pressed two wide, but weakened around the far turn. GIGI B. stalked along the inside, but faded around the far turn.
