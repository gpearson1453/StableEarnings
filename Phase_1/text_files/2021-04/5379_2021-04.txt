Footnotes
CLAY'S MOON STONE was well placed early on the inside, edged out on the second turn to make a three wide bid entering the stretch, hit the front near
the furlong marker then slowly edged away to prove best under a drive. LA ROSA DRIVE set the pace while racing near the rail, was headed entering the
stretch, stayed on gamely but could not go with the winner late, clearly second best. BELLA BELLE was rated early and was four wide throughout, offered
no gain while being up for the show award. CHEROKEE SUMMER was void of early speed, then was six wide past the quarter pole, came widest into the
stretch to offer a belated rally. STALEMATE offered no rally while five wide. WITT NINE stalked the pace three wide then tired. WILD PROSPECT dropped
back. SENORITA COMETA failed to menace.

Footnotes
GEE SHE SPARKLES was reserved in the early stages, moved up five wide nearing the eighth pole and finished well to get up under strong
encouragement. LADY AVE pressed the early leader from the outside down the backstretch, raced three deep in the drive, led inside the eighth pole but
couldn't hold off the winner late to finish second best. TRUE RUNNER was allowed to settle early, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and showed
good late interest. EMPRESSIVE REWARD was unhurried early on, moved up between rivals around the far turn, angled to the inside in the upper stretch
and flattened out. JAIME'S LIL FEAR stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, raced three deep at the eighth pole and had no late response.
DOC'S DENITA stalked the pace, raced in tight quarters at the three sixteenths pole and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. GREAT AFFECTION
showed good speed to set the pace along the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
GUERO DINERO was away alertly to set an uncontested pace, then was sent down when straightened for the drive, then was kept safe to prove best under
a drive. BOORNAZIAN was rated early on the inside, angled out three wide entering the stretch for clear racing room, was getting to the winner late, second
best. SHINE MY BLUE MOON was off a step slow, then raced on the inside on the turn, angled out in the stretch, rallied. MORO MISCHIEF was allowed to
settle early, came five wide into the stretch, offered a mild late rally. POLICY LIMIT stalked the early pace three wide, was roused past the five sixteenths
pole, but was empty. CRAZY RIDGE failed to menace. MY COMBAT BOOTS was off a step slow, not a threat. RED ECLIPSE was not a factor.

Footnotes
LIFE ON THE ROAD stalked the early pace, moved up five wide through the stretch and finished strongly to be well clear late under strong handling.
RADIANT KITTEN tracked the leader while racing two deep down the backstretch, challenged the leader into the upper stretch, led briefly but couldn't
match strides with the winner late to just hold the place position. FIRST STRING stalked early on, raced four wide past the eighth pole and made a good late
gain. LAUGHING LATINOS showed good early speed to set all the pace and weakened while racing along the inside through the drive. SWITCHERONIMO
was unhurried early on, raced four wide past the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. UPTAKE was slow early, raced three wide in the lane,
improved his position but never was a real threat. NO EXAGGERATION was reserved in the early stages, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never
was a factor. MY TRUE REWARD settled towards the middle of the pack early, raced five wide past the three sixteenths pole and had no response. MULE
SKINNER raced up close in the early stages and tired while racing four deep. SCHOENHARDT raced five wide around the first turn and showed little.
ISTAN WARRIOR dropped back early, raced five wide around the first turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
TELLURIDE QUEEN dueled for the early lead on the inside, was roused approaching the furlong marker and responded well to draw clear, game score.
SCARLETT O'HANNA dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid on the turn, led leaving the quarter pole, but flattened out in the final furlong,
saved place. STAR IN THE SKY stalked the early pace four wide, then came into the stretch needing a winning bid, was reluctant to switch leads, switched
leads in deep stretch to be gaining late. REALLY LUCKY was slow into stride, made a five wide middle move to be in contention but was empty in the drive.
BLUEGRASS DIXIE was reserved early on the inside, eased out on the turn to come five wide into the drive, offered a belated rally. ROMA'S CHOICE
chased the early pace from between horses then weakened. O. K. SOCKS chased the early pace on the inside then tired.

Footnotes
NAUTICAL GEM pressed the leader while racing two wide early on, took a narrow lead around the far turn and edged clear late under strong
encouragement. APPOLINA raced up close early on, raced five deep into the upper stretch and finished second best. RIZZI'S HONORS was slow early,
raced four wide past the three sixteenths pole and showed good late interest. EREBUNI showed good early speed along the inside and weakened in the
drive. SIDASTA settled off the early going, raced six wide at the eighth pole and had no late response. LUCKY FLASH stalked the pace, raced four deep
nearing the eighth marker and never was a factor. A FILLY CAN DREAM broke awkwardly, raced six wide in the lane never threatened. MIMI'S SONG
dropped back early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor.

Footnotes
BORDEAUX RED tracked the pace setter from the outset, made a three wide bid leaving the turn, wore down that rival the final hundred yards to prove best
under a drive. MISTER MMMMM was hustled early to set the pace while clear, remained clear leaving the furlong marker, but was caught late while being
clearly second best. SAY IT AIN'T SONI chased the early pace, then was four wide past the quarter pole, drifted in through the stretch while having some
gain. TEMPTED MISSION offered a belated rally. BATTLE OF WILL had no rally while four wide. TUCUM chased the early pace on the inside then
weakened. PAYNTED LOVER broke in the air at the start, failed to menace. TIZTRUCULENT was away alertly, then raced five wide before tiring. REK K
was not a threat. BAY MAMBA was not a factor.
