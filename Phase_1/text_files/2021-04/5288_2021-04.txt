Footnotes
RACE CRAFT raced within striking distance, moved up around the second turn, took the advantage entering the stretch and pulled away under steady
urging. BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL dueled for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second, while racing
on the rail. PIPES AND DRUMS bumped, stumbled start, raced near the back, made a late gain and missed second. BIG POWER RED lacked early speed,
gained ground, but was no factor. LEROY JENKINS broke in, bumped rival, raced in the back, had a wide trip and passed tired ones late. DIXIELAND
MUSIC vied for the early lead and faded. POWERSHOT raced near the back, came around the first turn wide and put forth an even effort. THE BIG
IRISHMAN raced within contention and was finished early. BOTTOMLESS raced in the middle of the field and stopped.

MAJESTIC EDGE raced within contention, was close throughout, rallied down the lane and got up late. I'M ALL MIXED UP sprinted to the front, drove clear,
saved ground, was caught late, but proved best of others. WISH FOR INTEREST raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside, made
a bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for show. GET DIRECTIONS raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid and was outfinished for
third. SHE'S THE BOSS raced within contention, saved ground around the turn and weakened. CHEROKEE BLESS void of early speed, improved position,
but was no factor. PERFECT JUSTICE raced evenly near the back, finished wide and lacked a bid. MATT'S PRIDE lacked early speed and was never
close. WRINKLED ROSE always raced near the back and showed little. CARLETTA raced within striking distance and dropped back.

Footnotes
JEWELED CROWN sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won under steady urging. SUPER LEGS unhurried in the beginning, came around
the second turn wide, made a late bid and gained ground. CHARMING FLIRT raced within contention, made a bid and lacked a late kick. GOLDEN
EXPRESSO pressed the pace, raced outside around the final turn and lacked a finish. CLOCKED IN TYME broke poorly, racing in the rear, showed late
interest, but was no factor. CAUGHT HIS EYE raced in the middle of the pack, made a bid and hung, while racing on the inside. SWEET MILAGROS void of
early speed and showed little. HANGING LAKE raced in the middle of the pack and faded. SHREW GRIT raced within contention and dropped back.
ENVOY'S GUILT always raced near the back and showed little.

MORRICONE dueled for the early advantage, drove clear and was kept to the task. WISE ANCHOR raced in the middle of the field, came around the final
turn on the outside, couldn't catch the winner, but was best of others. JANETS JAY JAY lacked early speed, made a steady gain, saved ground around the
second turn, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. COACH KENNY raced near the middle of the field, had a wide trip, made a mild bid and
finished evenly. SY MICHAEL raced near the back in the beginning, moved up, finished evenly and was no threat. GALLANT STAR void of early speed,
improved position, but was no threat. BUNKIE'S SONG challenged for the early lead and was finished early. PERFECT PERIGEE raced within striking
distance, dropped back and was no threat late. SMITTYS PATRIARCH showed early speed, raced wide around the first turn and retreated.

Footnotes
TIGERBEACH vied for the early lead, saved ground, drove clear and was kept to the task. YOUNG PHILLIP challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed
throughout, proved no match for the winner, but held off BEAUTY BOY for second. BEAUTY BOY raced near the rear in the early going, came around the
turn on the outside, made a wide gain and missed place. ZMOR ARISTOCAT broke in, bumped rival, raced in the middle of the field, made a bid and hung.
SUNNYONASTORMYDAY broke out, bumped rival, raced near the back, moved up, but was no factor. ROYAL REALITY showed early speed and faded.
BLUE WINGS pressed the early pace, saved ground and dropped back. RIDE TO THE WIRE bumped at the start, raced near the back, came around the
turn wide and was never a threat. HOMEVIEW bumped start, raced in the rear and showed little.

GOTTA GO stalked the leaders in the beginning, moved up around the final turn, rallied down the lane and drove clear. HIGH CRUISE sprinted to the front,
drove clear, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of others. BISTRAYA had an awkward start, racing in the rear, made a steady gain, finished
wide and got up for third. DEBONNAIRE DUDE raced within striking distance, made a bid and was outfinished for third. LADDIE BOY raced in the middle of
the pack, saved ground around the second turn, made a bid and hung. FORESTDUNGONE pressed the early pace and faded. CAYMANS COBRA void of
early speed, had a wide trip and was never close. OUTOFTHISGALAXY raced near the back, came around the first turn wide and was outrun. FAST
VERDICT always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
CANTRELL HILL stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up on the inside entering the final turn, took command, pulled away and proved the best.
MOMENT showed early speed, raced wide around the first turn, couldn't keep up with the winner late, but was best of others. DREWPOWER raced near the
middle of the field, made a late bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. PATRIOT'S WAR lacked early speed, raced outside around the
second turn, made a wide bid and missed third. BUXTERHOOTER raced in the middle of the pack, made a bid and hung. THREE RUN HOMER went to the
front, drove clear and faded. ZING ZANG lacked early speed and was never a threat. PURIM KING raced in the rear and showed little. MISTER INTUITION
raced within striking distance, saved ground and dropped back. HONORARIAN showed early speed, retreated to the rear, lost contact and was eased to
wire.
