Footnotes
HOLY MEISTER broke alertly, settled within striking range two to three wide for a half-mile, bid outside COUNT DOWN around the far turn, got the best of
that rival a furlong out and drove clear. COUNT DOWN broke to the lead, yielded to FINDING MISCHIEF on the first turn, rebid outside that foe after a
half-mile and moved inside as HOLY MEISTER came calling, drifted out under left-hand pressure in midstretch unable to cope with the latter, and ran on
clearly second best. MAURO'S TEAM saved ground to the far turn, moved to the two-path going by FINDING MISCHIEF, could not seriously threaten and
ran on best of the remainder. ON THE ENGINE broke a step slow, and was no factor two to three wide. AESTHETICALLY broke a step slowly, and was
always outrun. FINDING MISCHIEF rushed up to take over outside COUNT DOWN on the first turn, sped off up the backstretch, yielded readily entering the
far turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
WEDONTBELIEVEHER set the pace in the two path, drew clear around the turn and widened under a drive. MARKISTAN lagged well back in the two path,
swung five wide near the five-sixteenths pole, was along late for the place and was vanned off. TREVESS chased the pace inside, was no match for the
winner and was outfinished for the place. LET'S BE HONEST had her head turned at the start, raced two wide between foes, angled out and bumped
SALSA RITA in upper stretch and lacked a rally. SALSA RITA prompted the winner in the three path, was bumped in upper stretch and faded. WHIP ME
INTO SHAPE chased four wide and retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
COMISKEY PARK sped clear early inside, widened steadily under a drive through the furlong grounds, and was geared down the last sixteenth of a mile.
DIVERT raced four to five wide throughout, rallied mildly off the turn and ran on a distant second. TRINNI JOHN was outsprinted two wide for a half-mile,
and offered a mild response to best the remainder. EXONERATED PREZ pursued the winner toward the inside to the stretch, and faded. JUGUETE
steadied between horses near the nine-sixteenths pole, and moved out four wide tiring near the stretch. PERSONAL MEADOW chased three wide for a
half, and tired. AIKMAN broke awkwardly spotting the field two lengths, was in tight up against the rail heading to the turn, and dropped far back. CITY
GLORY showed little inside. PARTY OF NO was finished early three to four wide. TENUEM broke two lengths slow, and was never close.

POR QUE NO set a rated pace inside, kicked clear nearing the lane and held clear under a drive. HONEY PANTS tracked the pace from the rail, angled
three wide near the quarter pole and finished willingly to be clearly second best. SWEET PEARL saved ground off the pace, tipped two wide near the
quarter pole and ran on for the show. FLIGHT TO SHANGHAI pressed the winner two wide and weakened in the lane. MRS FRANKEL (IRE) broke
outwardly, was in range three wide and came up empty in the lane. ORBS BABY GIRL was fractious in the gate, raced two wide and lacked a closing bid.

Footnotes
PERFECT ENOUGH settled off the pace for six furlongs, was roused near the quarter-pole shifting out four wide, rallied steadily through the lane and
overhauled TONE FEELIN from outside to win going away. TONE FEELIN bumped with COLLIERY after the start, then was clipped behind by that rival a
couple strides after that, moved swiftly three wide on the far turn, took over and moved inward drawing clear through upper stretch, but could not hold the
winner safe. VIKING PLUNDER bumped with COLLIERY soon after the start, steadied along inside behind the leaders on the first turn, raced two wide
around the far turn in range, and rallied mildly for the show. GUN OF GLORY steadied in tight between horses on the first turn, continued with little
maneuvering room shuffled back after a half-mile, advanced two wide after six furlongs, and was no late threat finishing one-paced. BEYOND THE CALL
prompted the pace outside, reached a brief lead approaching the top of the stretch, but could not sustain the bid and faded. COLLIERY was bumped
between horses soon after the start, then clipped heels behind TONE FEELIN and stumbled badly, and never reached contention. WESTERLY WIND was
four wide into the first turn, advanced after a half-mile, but was finished soon after that. EL TABERNERO ONE raced three wide on the first turn, and retired
after a half. UNIMPEACHED set the pace inside for six furlongs, and folded up.

NICOLE PRINCESS stalked the duel in the clear inside, angled three wide nearing the quarter pole, swept to the front turning for home and held sway under
a drive. PINK FIZZ advanced three and four wide around the turn, steadily gained outside through the lane but could not reel in the winner. GONE TO
CABO dueled inside to upper stretch and held well enough to preserve the place. LIGHTS ON GIRL dueled outside of GONE TO CABO to upper stretch
and weakened. FLORADO failed to menace while racing four wide. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE was outrun outside.

UNCLE FUN lagged well back early, began taking closer order after six furlongs while moving out three wide, rallied through a large opening toward the
inside past the furlong marker and was just up at the wire. BIG BLUE steadied along the inside through the stretch the first time, rallied four wide
approaching the stretch, swapped back to his left lead a sixteenth out and just missed on the far outside. KARTANO saved ground to the far turn, switched
out three wide at the top of the lane, loomed through the furlong grounds but was outfinished between horses. FUEGO CALIENTE edged closer after six
furlongs three then four wide, rallied to a short lead in midstretch, then weakened while drifting out. HALCYON DIGEST cleared to the early lead, set a

Footnotes
KAHIKO rated inside, swung four wide nearing the quarter pole, surged to the front nearing the eighth pole and drew off while ridden out. STARRY HOPE
prompted the pace three wide around the first turn, bid two wide into the far turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, led to midstretch but was no
match for the winner from there. EASY ON THE SUGAR raced three wide in midpack, made progress three deep around the far turn but was no match for
the top two in the lane. ESTELLINA failed to menace while racing two wide. ALEXANDRA AM I set the pace inside and tired in the lane. TREASURED
NIKKY steadied along while up close inside and faded nearing the lane. UNMARKED MONEY was outrun inside. KICK OUT THE JAMS was bumped at the
start, saved ground early, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. ALL'S FAIR was bumped at the start, raced three wide and lacked a
rally. SEAMIALAUGH had early speed two wide and retreated three wide around the far turn. BACKSPARK played no factor while racing two and three
wide. BORN ON THE SUN was bumped at the start and played no further factor while saving ground.
