Footnotes
SAYWARD pressed the early pace, went six wide into the turn, took control late and held for the win. TRES TAURUS was void of speed, raced between
rivals into the turn, was closing late and needed more ground. ADULTING set a pressured early pace, went three wide into the turn, drifted in and
weakened. TUFFENOUGHTOSTART raced in mid pack early, went seven wide out of the turn and finished belatedly. KEANNA was taken back early, raced
eight wide out of the turn and offered a mild late rally. PERKY BRUNETTE tracked the early pace, went five wide into the turn and was empty. FILTHY was
reserved early from the inside and offered no rally. RED NOVA was unhurried, was bothered by loose horse into the turn, angled out far wide out of the turn
and never fired. YATAHEY ducked in at the gap, lost the rider and walked off.

Footnotes
QUANDARY tracked the early pace, went six wide through the turn, was gaining late and was up in time for the win. KEEPONROCKINMEBABY set a
pressured early pace, went three wide into the turn, angled in, opened up, couldn't hold off the winner and just missed. LIS LA VICTOIRE was outrun early,
went four wide into the turn, angled in and offered a mild late rally. TICO TIME raced in mid pack early, went six wide into the turn, angled out and finished
belatedly. ADRIENNE'S PROGENY was reserved early, raced seven wide through the turn and never fired. FAITHMEISTER pressed the early pace, went
five wide and faded. NOWORRIESTODAY was unhurried early, went three wide and had no rally. BONITA BALLARD was allowed to settle early, went eight
wide in the turn and was empty. JOIE LA VICTOIRE was void of any speed and was no factor. SOUTHSIDE CAROLINE was taken back, angled out nine
wide out of the turn and was no threat.
