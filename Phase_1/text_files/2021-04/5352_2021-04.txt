Footnotes
EUROROPER motored to front immediately after break, established a ground saving stance and led every step on the way to the score. GODDESS OF
WONDER trekked three wide, led the second flight through the bend, but proved no match for winner in final furlong. PLINKY rallied mildly to earn the show
after giving chase to frontrunner from a three wide pose. FIRST AT THE SCENE settled mid pack through the opening stages and asked for a rally at upper
stretch, but was unable to run down rivals. RARE WARRIOR pressed the pace from between rivals and gave way to late charging foes in closing strides.
OUR JEANO gave chase from a two path stance and was no threat. EUROTIGRE failed to menace. FOCUS ON POLLY rated back and was no factor.

hand ridden. OBSTRUCTED VIEW set the pace then was challenged on the second turn but was clearly second best. CLASSY MELODY was unhurried
early then steadily advanced but had no late response in the drive. SMOOTH OPERATOR stalked the pace from the inside but failed to menace. FAR LEFT

trailed the field from the inside but was not a factor. CAPTAIN COMEBACK was disqualified from first to last per OHRC ruling 21-WRD-024.

Footnotes
ROCKIN RONI awaited options along the backstretch, closed the gap on the leaders through the bend, circled rivals four wide at upper stretch and got up
for the score. MYSTICAL MATILDA pressed the pace while saving ground but was unable to fend off the late charge of ROCKIN RONI in final furlong.
GOSPEL DEWEY hustled away from outset and led the field through the first two calls from a two path stance, then was unable to sustain the bid in closing
strides. AMERICAN PAYDAY disputed the pace as the outermost rival of three in the early going, maintained that path into the homestretch but came up
empty in crucial portion of contest. DOWNEASTER ALEXA lacked a needed rally after showing reserve through the opening half. MISS KESHAR menaced
mildly while giving chase from a back rated stance. MISSY QUICK trailed from outset.

LOVE TO LEARN stalked the pace from the inside and took command in the final furlong to draw clear under a drive. DESTINY'S LOVE set the pace from
the two path but was caught in the final furlong and was no match for the winner. WHEW was allowed to settle in the two path then drifted out in the stretch
drive but was able to make a late rally for the show. GOODNIGHTSUGAR chased the leaders but lacked the late response needed to gain on the leaders.
TAPINDEED stalked the pace from the three path but weakened in the stretch drive. FLYRTIE ROCKETTE was unhurried early and was never a factor.
BRIGHTEST was off a step slow then moved to contention off the pace but tired into the stretch.

Footnotes
WESTPORT hustled to assume immediate command, widened the margin through the opening half and was ridden out for the victory. ROSIE'S OUTLAW
showed reserve along the inside before rallying strongly to earn the place but no match for runaway winner. WENT settled into the two path along the
backstretch, swung four wide through the turn, maintained that line into homestretch and finished gamely for sow honors. HEADEDTOTHESTARS lacked a
rally to end a three path trip. ULTRA SPECIAL was unhurried early, traveled widest of all through the bend and into upper stretch before finishing evenly.
MEDICINE MAN flashed early speed and contested the pace through through the opening half before fading rapidly in the late going. SHADES OF GLORY
rated back in the early stages then passed tiring foes. LITTLE MAD MAX saved ground to no avail. STEPPIN SHEP failed to menace.

GUIDED MISSILE stalked the pace from the inside then angled out on the second turn and caught the leader at the eighth pole and drew clear.
ROCKPORT KAT set the pace for three quarters then was caught at the eighth pole and had no final kick. CHOCOLATEICECREAM was well placed in the
two path made a mild bid on the final turn and held the third spot. DONT TELL NOOBODY vied for the lead from the two path and gave way. SHINING
SOURCE was allowed to settle while racing four wide made a mild bid on the second turn but was empty in the stretch drive. SHANGHAI SKIPPER trailed
the field and showed little. TIMELY REPLY was unhurried early and was never a factor.

Footnotes
TRUSTWORTHY exchanged command as the widest of four pacesetters and scored the victory by refusing to lose the stretch duel. FORMIDABLE FORCE
settled into second flight, angled out nearing the half pole, circled rivals through the second bend and lost the lengthy stretch duel. MACHA'S REWARD
showed reserve through the opening half, and rallied in the late going to earn the show. LINDANTE rated in the second flight for the opening half with a four
wide stance, trekked wide through the second turn while gaining a brief lead at the quarter pole, then gave way to rivals in final furlong. JOHN ALLEN failed
to sustain bid after setting pace from a ground saving pose. ARCHRIVAL rushed from outset to contest the pace from a three wide stance, maintained that
path all the way and tired in crucial portion of contest. PLUMBAGO improved placing with late interest after trailing the field in early stages. LORD
STRATTON was hurried through the opening turn, shared command along the backstretch, then eclipsed in the homestretch. ROLLS ROYCE DEAL failed
to threaten from a back rated stance.
