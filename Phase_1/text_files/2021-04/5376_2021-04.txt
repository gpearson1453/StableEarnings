quarter pole, battled with TRISTRAM SPEAKER through the stretch and prevailed late. TRISTRAM SPEAKER set early fractions, was two wide along the
second turn, was confronted nearing the quarter pole by HYDROGEN, gamely battled with that rival through the stretch but could not fend him off, while
besting the rest. DON'TTEASETHETIGER saved ground through the early stages while settling just off of the pace, continued on the rail along the second
turn, was asked for run in the stretch but had no late rally. TERRYS TOM CAT had no speed early, was four wide along the second turn and was not a
threat.

IMA HAPPY CAT took command of the early fractions, saved ground while two wide along the turn, was confidently handled into the stretch and kicked
clear as much the best. SING IN THE WIND chased the early pace, was two wide along the turn while chasing the leader, and made a steady run in the
stretch for second, though was not challenging the winner. MARILYN'S SMILE had no early speed, was two wide on the turn while toward the back, and
was outfinished in the stretch. LEFT ALONE (GB) chased the early pace, improved position along the turn to stalk the pace while three wide, could not go
on with that bid and tired in the stretch run. SPRING HEAT stalked the early pacesetter, was outrun on the turn while saving ground, and flattened out in the
stretch run. MOLLIE O ' MCEVOY saved ground through the turn and was always outrun.

CARTELLATE stalked the early fractions of QUICK AND SILVER, kept a two wide running position through the turn, took the lead entering the stretch and
was clear late. CONCUR chased the early pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out for racing room into the stretch and made a late bid though was
not challenging the winner. UNBRIDLED'S SKYE broke outward at the start into DESERT DUDE, chased the early pace, was three wide along the turn, and
was outfinished in the stretch drive. NOLONGERAHOBBY was unhurried early,improved position along the backstretch and the turn while three wide, was
close up entering the stretch, but weakened late. QUICK AND SILVER set fractions from a ground saving trip, was confronted entering the stretch by
CARTELLATE and tired in the drive. ARNO'S MANE MAN chased the early pacesetter, lost position while two wide along the turn, and could not muster a
late rally. DESERT DUDE chased the early pace, was four wide along the turn while improving position, but was outrun off of the turn and weakened late.
CAJUN BETTOR settled in the middle of the pack early, was outrun onto the backstretch, was three wide along the turn, and gave out late.

Footnotes
INFATUATE was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack early, improved position along the backstretch, came four wide along the second turn while
pressuring the pace, collared DRASARIO (IRE) in the stretch and was clear late. POGO chased the early pace then settled in the midflight, saved ground
through the second turn, improved position into the second turn and was outkicked in the stretch though still second best. DRASARIO (IRE) stalked the
early pace, was two wide between horses on the second turn, took the lead along the second turn, led into the stretch but could not hold off the top two in
the drive. QUAZE VIPER settled in the middle of the pack early, was five wide along the second turn, and finished evenly in the stretch.
FROMAJACKTOAKING was unhurried early, made a steady move through the backstretch and on the second turn while three wide, but could not go on
with that bid and tired in the stretch drive. MOOGIE CAT set the early fractions while saving ground, was confronted by DRASARIO (IRE) along the second
turn, kept up with that rival to the head of the stretch and weakened late. ASSET stalked the early pace through the first turn and backstretch, was three
wide between horses on the second turn while losing ground, and tired in the stretch run. GEE GEE WHIZ was allowed to settle toward the rear of the field
early, was two wide along the second turn while losing position and had no late rally. STORMING WARRIOR settled in the midflight early, saved ground
through the second turn while losing position and was not a threat in the stretch drive. BELHAM was unhurried early, was five wide on the second turn while
