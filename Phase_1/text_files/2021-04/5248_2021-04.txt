Footnotes
SCUTTLEBUZZ settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied on the outside under a right-handed crop and
closed strongly to get up late. DISCIPLANARIAN established a good position just off the pace, was asked while two then three wide on the turn, spun four
wide into the stretch, chased the pacesetter under a drive on the outside into the final furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, gained a short lead
inside that pole, fought with the winner late and missed while able to get the place. OUR DESTINY displayed good speed, showed the way down the
backstretch, raced inside on the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, led under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken but held
the show. RED MULE was off a touch slow then brushed with a foe after the start, angled in towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, shifted out in upper
stretch, gained under a drive into the final furlong and finished willingly for the last spot in the superfecta. AMISTAD broke a bit slow, was urged along at the
rear of the field, traveled around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch, moved out near the three-sixteenths and improved position.
FALSE ALARM came out at the start then was corrected by the rider, settled off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response. FUTURE BOOK settled on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and
also lacked the needed response. HALSTAAT settled on the outside towards the rear, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the turn,
moved out in upper stretch and gained late but failed to threaten. HUDSON OVERPASS tracked the pace on the inside of a foe, chased in the two path on
the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into upper stretch and weakened. DANG IT broke a bit awkwardly then was taken in hand early, moved up under
some urging to stalk the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the turn and tired. FLORIDA ENDEAVOUR was taken under a tight hold early then
settled off the pace, dropped back in the two path on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
CREATIVE CAIRO bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way, tracked the pace just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive lugging in on her wrong lead straightened away and near the eighth pole hopping tracks
on the course and almost to be in behind the leader at that station, got corrected and rallied surging late to just get up in the final jump to prevail. MISS
BONNIE T showed the way in the very early stages along the inside before conceding the front to LITTLE NUTTER tipping out to the two path as that rival
took to the inside past the stands for the first time, tracked that rival in closest aim two then three wide leading the main flight down the backstretch as the
leader briefly slipped away, took closer order into the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and steadily advanced to take command just
outside the quarter pole before spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat
and was nailed at the finish. GABBY SQUARED broke in a step at the start and was corrected, tracked the pace along the inside, remained patiently
handled until called upon near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. ZOIKES
(FR) broke in at the start bumping CREATIVE CAIRO, then got pinched between that rival and WOW due to pressure inside from HARLEM HEIGHTS,
chased two then three wide from near the rear of the field coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung three then two wide into upper stretch
straightened away and kicked on belatedly through the stretch. MO GIRL saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from
home, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and passed tired foes. LITTLE NUTTER established the front past the stands for the initial time and
tucked inside once in the clear, showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits widening away from the rest of the field briefly midway down
the backstretch before the field took closer order into the far turn, came under coaxing approaching the five-sixteenths as MISS BONNIE T steadily
advanced and began to apply pressure, yielded the front near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch running on prominent to the furlong grounds
before weakening in the late stages. WOW three wide through the opening bend, chased four then five wide in the clear on the outside, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. HARLEM HEIGHTS broke out at the start bumping CREATIVE CAIRO in
concert with ZOIKES, who broke inwards, raced three wide through the first turn just off the pace before settling three then four wide in pursuit down the
backstretch and through the far turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, went four wide for home and weakened. STRONG POINT tracked the
pace along the inside from mid pack under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered no kick.

Footnotes
ROMP settled towards the rear of the field, was urged four wide on the turn, passed the quarter-pole under a right-handed crop then came five wide into the
stretch, switched to a left-handed crop outside the three-sixteenths, rallied on the outside, closed well while lugging in a bit, had the rider stand up in the
saddle as he cruised to the lead just inside the sixteenth-pole and was eased up in victory. PURPLE HEARTED settled comfortably on the outside, moved
closer late on the backstretch, ranged up three then four wide on the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch, chased while fighting on well in the final
furlong and finished with good courage to get the place. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN showed good speed, disputed the pace while near the middle of the
track, moved in leaving the backstretch, shook clear while three then two wide on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then put to a drive in upper
stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while well clear for the show. RESPECT FOR ALL was urged along towards the front, dropped back
late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to rally. BLU GROTTO broke out and
bumped with a foe, settled at the rear of the field, raced inside early on the turn then angled out, reached the six path before the five-sixteenths and was no
factor. JIMMY THE KID bumped with a rival at the start, contested the pace down the backstretch, vied inside early on the turn, dropped back at the
three-eighths then shifted three wide, chased into upper stretch then moved in under a drive and weakened. CENTAVO bumped with rivals on both sides at
the start, settled off the pace, moved out leaving the backstretch, was urged three wide on the turn and failed to respond. RE CREATED settled towards the
rear, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went two to three wide on the turn and was no factor. ECHOES OF DESTINY settled on the outside, was
urged five wide on the turn and also failed to respond.

Footnotes
GUARDIAN MOON prompted the pace four then three wide patiently handled and advancing on the front to take narrow command swinging three wide into
upper stretch, had the rider peek back over his right shoulder before rousing his charge at the three-sixteenths, drew clear under a drive kept to task to the
finish. SNICKET coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. MOANA'S TALE three wide in pursuit under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four
wide into upper stretch and kept on for the show honors. FRESCO three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. MORE GLITTER coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace from the two path between rivals
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the late stages. IFIHADACHANCE chased along the inside
under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. LUNE LAKE hustled from the gate, established the front shortly after
the start and showed the way under light coaxing and under pressure from a pair, got headed near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and
weakened. CARAMOCHA chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch, got out into the turn to be five wide and came under a firm near side grip
before being coaxed along at the three-eighths, went three to four wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
HOROLOGIST came away in good order, went around the first turn in the four path, stalked the pace on the outside while in hand, inched closer in the three
path on the far turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole then was put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop near the furlong
marker then drifted out, was quickly switched back to a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. MRS. DANVERS
went to the front, was well rated while setting an uncontested pace towards the inside, came under urging when confronted at the five-sixteenths, lost the
advantage to the winner at the quarter-pole, fought on well under a left-handed crop in the stretch but missed while narrowly able to get the place. LUCKY
STRIDE broke awkwardly and was off a couple of lengths slow, went three wide on the first turn, settled nicely on the outside, was asked with a half-mile to
run, went four then five wide under urging on the far turn, gained late on that bend, chased outside in the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the place
while clear for the show. QUEEN NEKIA tossed her head early and was taken up briefly, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved at the rear of the field,
started the far turn in the two path then dropped to the rail, was roused at the five-sixteenths then driven three wide into the stretch, pursued the vanguard in
the drive and lacked the needed kick. THANKFUL went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged three then four wide on the far turn,
dropped back five wide into the stretch and capitulated. FLASHNDYNAMITE was rated inside to the two path on the first turn, settled off the pace down the
backstretch, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, moved from the rail to the three path on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and had
nothing left.

Footnotes
VETTORI KIN (BRZ) just off the inside through the first turn, tracked three paths off the inside near the rear of the field, tucked back to the two path through
the far turn and got let out taking the inside route into upper stretch, had CASTAGNO float to the two path straightened away and rallied up an open rail
seam to issue a challenge and take command near the sixteenth marker, dug in and held safe from a late closing rival to prevail. NOBLE THOUGHT broke
in a step at the start brushing with KING OF SPADES, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung two to
three wide into upper stretch, tipped out a path nearing the sixteenth pole while offering up late foot to latch on the winner as that foe hit the finish.
GEARHEAD along the inside through the first turn, chased three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn advancing on the front before being set
down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive heads apart for command to the sixteenth marker when overtaken in tandem with the
leader by the eventual winner, ran on willingly for the show honors. CASTAGNO forwardly placed three wide through the first turn latched on to the outside
of the early leader, took over command nearing the five-eighths pole and tucked to the two path, showed the way coming under pressure through the
presence of BETA to the outside, tucked inside through the far turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch,
came off the rail straightened away digging in under a drive under threat, got collared near the sixteenth pole and was outfinished in the late stages. KING
OF SPADES brushed at the start by NOBLE THOUGHT, who broke in a step, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. CHIEF KNOW IT ALL just off the inside through the first turn, got
bumped into the backstretch by HERO'S HOPE when four paths off the inside, continued four wide through the far turn placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and offered no response. BETA forwardly placed two then three wide in aim of the front, advanced to apply
pressure through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened after straightening away.
MANIFEST DESTINY showed brief speed from the two path before yielding command near the five-eighths pole, faded steadily through the field placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. HERO'S HOPE three wide through the first turn, bumped with CHIEF KNOW IT ALL
into the backstretch and went five paths off the inside, then three wide through the far turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, swung six wide for home
and tired.

Footnotes
FAMILY BIZ was hustled from the start, showed early speed then was well placed just off the pace, passed the half-mile pole under coaxing, was urged
along in the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop, gained to make a bid into the final furlong, took the lead outside the sixteenth-pole
then moved clear under steady urging. ARHAM settled on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn, chased
outside in the stretch and finished willingly for the place while no match for the winner. YANKEE DIVISION stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the
pressure on the leader in the three to four path on the turn, took the advantage just inside the three-eighths, shook clear into the stretch, lost the lead to the
winner outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened but was well clear for the show. TEXAS SWING tossed his head early, settled near the back, moved from
three to five wide on the turn, dropped in inside the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. KID BOURBON settled near the rear, was asked
leaving the backstretch, moved from the inside to the three path on the turn, shifted out while asked for his best in upper stretch and failed to rally.
ANANROAD showed good speed, set the pace with some company to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked nearing the three-eighths then
lost the advantage, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop and stopped then was eased late but walked off.

DELAWARE (GB) bumped at the start by HIERONYMUS, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, angled five
to six wide into upper stretch, offered up a good kick to close with a rush running down the once clear leader to get up in the last jumps and prevail
establishing a course record. RINALDI established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, edged
clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing lone threat and was nailed in the final strides to the finish. DECORATED INVADER tracked the
pace along the inside, got let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and was paused in traffic unable to tip out on wait until gaining clearance a
furlong out, then offered up a mild bid to secure the show honors. PENALTY two to three paths off the inside near the rear but among rivals after the start,
clipped the back of ANALYZE IT as that rival was taken in reserve past the wire for the first time near the seven-eighths pole and bobbled, then got checked
off the heels of that same rival six and a half furlongs from home before tucking inside at the tail of the field through the first turn, grew detached from the
main body of the field down the backstretch tipped two to three wide, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went eight wide into upper stretch and
kicked on belatedly showing good courage after the rough going early on. TIBERIUS MERCURIUS coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace just off the inside
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. HIERONYMUS broke in at the start
bumping DELAWARE and got coaxed away, raced just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got let out spinning just off the inside for home and
weakened in the late going. ANALYZE IT two to three wide past the stands the initial time forwardly placed, got placed to a rating hold and backed up
getting clipped behind past the wire the first time by PENALTY before forcing that rival to check off his heels a second time with six and a half furlongs to go,
went three wide through the first turn before settling just off the leader down the backstretch, continued three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing
near the quarter pole, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong, then was reported to have bled.

Footnotes
PAVE IT bumped with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained
the lead inside the three-sixteenths and drew clear under strong urging. KIKKERLAND bumped with a rival at the start, was well placed in third position,
came under urging in the four path on the turn, chased outside in the stretch and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. JOEY LOOSE
LIPS was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied near the rail on the turn, was asked just inside the three-eighths, turned into
the stretch under the crop, lost the advantage to the winner inside the three-sixteenths and proved no match then lost the place while narrowly able to get
the show. FLIPPING FUN was fractious in the gate, raced off the pace while urged along, bumped with a foe near the nine-sixteenths, went three wide on
the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and finished with late energy to just miss the trifecta. HOTEL CHARLIE broke in at the start, settled at the rear,
went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. MICRO ME brushed with a rival at the start then was taken in hand, was urged along on the
outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. ROYAL KAZ was urged along off the pace, went two to three wide
on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and came up empty. HANGOUT brushed with an opponent at the start, settled off the pace, bumped with
a foe near the nine-sixteenths, went four then five wide on the turn and showed little.
