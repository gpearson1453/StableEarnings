Footnotes
I'LL DO IT FOR YOU away quickly then sprinted clear around the first turn, inched away at the quarter pole, increased the lead under right-handed urging
then held safely in the closing moments. LOOKINTOGETEVEN unhurried in the early going, looked to advance but lacked room and steadied at the quarter
pole, stayed inside then moved out in upper stretch, surged late and was closing fast on the winner. UNDISTURBED put in tight quarters and checked into
the first turn, saved ground to the stretch, lacked a serious bid and held the show. CINNTE WINNTE (IRE) was off slow to begin, reserved early from inside,
crept closer up the backstretch, waited for room with a quarter mile to go, steered off the rail in upper stretch and finished evenly. CRAZY SPEIGHTY drifted
out into the first turn then came back to the three path, moved out on the backstretch, entered the far turn five wide then exited in the four path and never
threatened. SHEZAGHOST chased off the inside, went outside rivals on the second bend, came three wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. LADY
CROCKER stalked two wide around the first turn then moved out into the three path on the backstretch, angled back into the two path around the far turn
and weakened. PUSHINGUPDAISIES had early speed outside the winner then was taken in hand to a stalking position, chased two wide to the stretch and
faded.

Footnotes
KING ABNER dueled from inside with ZESTFUL throughout, continued to battle down the stretch and dug in late to prevail. ZESTFUL dueled outside KING
ABNER to the lane, battled with that rival through the final furlong, finished gamely to the wire but had to settle for second best. KERSHAW took the first turn
four then three wide, settled off the pace, went outside a rival on the backstretch, came three wide into the stretch and kept on for a clear third. PUBILIUS
SYRUS trailed through the early stages, moved out and split foes at the quarter pole, exited that bend three wide and improved position. MONGOLIAN
WIND stalked the top pair from inside, lost ground around the far turn, entered the stretch a bit off the rail and flattened out. GRAY MAGICIAN traveled
mid-pack off the inside, went four wide around the second bend and weakened. PRODIGAL SON went five then four wide around the first turn, raced off the
rail then angled in entering the far turn, saved ground to the stretch and failed to menace.

line. CITY RAGE stalked off the inside, took the turn two then three wide, rallied widest, four deep at the sixteenth pole and missed. I WILL NOT bumped
with RAGER and steadied early, chased between rivals then moved to the rail around the turn, bid outside the leader and challenged three deep with a
sixteenth to go and got outkicked by the top pair. BEST CHANCE got bumped twice at the start, trailed early, went two then three wide around the turn,
altered out when BEDROCK steered out at the eighth pole and closed belatedly. BEDROCK crowded between rivals and checked hard early, moved back

crossed over, remained unchallenged to the furlong grounds and got caught nearing the sixteenth pole. ABSOLUTE UNIT stalked three deep to the turn,

three-sixteenths, drifted out a bit and won going away. TODAY'S FLAVOR came away a bit slow, placed well behind the top pair while on the inside, steered
out into the stretch, closed well and bested the rest. PATRON D'ORO up close outside the top pair, bid three deep on the turn, lost contact with the winner
in upper stretch, flattened out late but saved the show. BOBBY BO broke in and bumped rival at the start, dueled for the lead outside rival, vied between

Footnotes
GOING GLOBAL (IRE) bumped both sides at the start, tracked two wide or outside a rival, ranged up three wide around the far turn, took over in upper
stretch, drifted inward and held gamely. CLOSING REMARKS stumbled and was bothered by IVY LEAGUE in the beginning, angled to the inside early,
saved ground into the stretch, rallied up the fence but was not enough. SENSIBLE CAT away quickly from inside, set the pace through the early stages,
held a diminishing lead into the lane, was overtaken in upper stretch, could not match the top pair inside the furlong grounds but stayed on to secure the
show. IVY LEAGUE came in soon after the start, settled off the pace, raced two wide then angled four wide into the drive and showed a mild response to
improve. QUATTROELLE (IRE) bumped with outside rival at the start, traveled along the inside then angled three wide leaving the far turn, put in tight
quarters when ROYAL ADDRESS shifted out at the three-sixteenths, shifted inward in upper stretch and could not rally. ROYAL ADDRESS (IRE) bumped
with inside rival at the start, forwardly placed in the two path, shifted out at the three-sixteenths pole and faded. DERBY QUEST got bumped on both sides
at the start, dropped back early and was always outrun.

the pace along the inside, lost command at the five-sixteenths, chased the winner into the stretch and held the show. LIBERAL (IRE) tracked from inside,

Footnotes
ROCK YOUR WORLD vied for the lead into the first turn then assumed control and set a pressured pace, cleared outside rival into the far turn, saved
ground into the stretch, urged right-handed in the drive and drew away. MEDINA SPIRIT up close early outside the top pair, chased three then two wide into
the stretch, could not threaten the winner in the final furlong but finished willingly for the place honors. DREAM SHAKE stalked the pace from inside, coaxed
along at the three-eighths, cut the corner into the stretch and flattened to third. DEFUNDED traveled five then four wide around the clubhouse turn,
remained well off the rail then angled to the three path nearing the far turn, advanced outside rivals around that bend and kept to task in the lane to earn a
minor award. LAW PROFESSOR tracked two wide, shied from rival around the first turn, went between rivals on the backstretch, lacked room and checked
around the far turn, angled out and kept on to improve position. PARNELLI vied for the lead into the first turn, then pressed into the backstretch, lost contact
into the far turn, dropped back around the bend and faded. THE GREAT ONE went five then four wide around the first turn, raced off the rail in range then
outside rivals, chased between foes at the quarter pole, tipped out upper stretch and weakened. BACK RING LUCK bumped with OTTOTHELEGEND soon
after the start, unhurried in the beginning, came three wide into the lane, eased in the drive and walked off. OTTOTHELEGEND bumped with BACK RING
LUCK soon after the start, sat off the pace, dropped back around the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
CHARMAINE'S MIA sped to the front, set the pace inside, inched away in upper stretch and held well over the late charge from the runner-up. DOGTAG
settled along the inside in mid-pack, checked at the three-eighths pole, waited for room leaving the far turn, tipped out and split foes nearing the eighth pole,
closed well and was gaining on the winner to the wire. WARREN'S SHOWTIME tracked two wide then three wide into the stretch, was four deep at the
furlong marker and needed to find more in deep stretch. TAPWATER raced off the pace in the two path, steered five wide leaving the final turn, kept to task
in the final furlong and filled out the superfecta. LAURA'S LIGHT up close early outside the pacesetter, took aim two wide into the stretch, chased between
foes at the eighth pole and flattened. RAYMUNDOS SECRET tucked inside early, saved ground stalking the pace and could not find the needed response.
RIDEFORTHECAUSE unhurried in the early stages from inside, moved into the two path around the far turn, came back to the rail in the stretch and never
made an impact. IPPODAMIA'S GIRL chased three wide or outside rivals, exited the far turn four wide and tired.

Footnotes
QUIET SECRETARY stumbled leaving the gate but recovered quickly to taken the early lead, cleared inside rival around the first turn, set all the pace to the
stretch and drew away in deep stretch. CASSIE BELLE showed early speed then chased the leader from inside then moved off the rail, took aim two to
three wide into the stretch but could not match the winner late but proved second best. APPLECROSS (IRE) tracked from inside moved into the two path
around the first turn, between rivals up the backstretch, tipped out in upper stretch, went between rivals at the eighth pole and gained the show. ALMOST A
FACTOR settled near the back of the pack on the inside then moved out on the backstretch, entered the stretch two wide then angled out and finished
willingly for a minor award. GOOD ON PAPER stalked the pace along the inside, bumped with ALL QUALITY entering the stretch and lacked the needed
bid. ALL QUALITY chased two wide then between rivals, bumped with inside rival into the stretch and flattened out. COVER VERSION sat off the pace,
raced outside rivals on the backstretch, angled four wide around the far turn, came out in upper stretch and failed to rally. ARCTIC ROLL (GB) went two
wide into the first turn then settled inside, hugged the rail into the stretch and never threatened. NOBLE HEARTED stumbled at the start, raced three deep
up the backstretch, angled out upper stretch and weakened. LAVENDER (IRE) hopped slightly at the start, traveled near the back of the pace, angled out
and raced eight wide in upper stretch and was never a factor. NICE ICE traveled three wide into the first turn, remained off the rail and three wide into the
drive and weakened.

Footnotes
THE CHOSEN VRON tracked off the rail, bothered by rival nearing the half-mile marker, angled inside that rival then to the rail on the turn, entered the
stretch two wide, steered outside the top pair, drew alongside the leader and got bumped mid-stretch, then drew clear late. GOOD WITH PEOPLE dueled
for the lead from outside, cleared foe in upper stretch, drifted out and bumped THE CHOSEN VRON mid-stretch and got outkicked. LETSGETLUCKY
dueled for the lead from inside, lost contact in upper stretch and weakened in deep stretch. FOUND MY BALL shifted in at the start, chased off the inside
then came in and caused rival to check twice approaching the half-mile pole, took the turn two wide and improved position. MISTER BOLD tracked outside a
rival up the backstretch, went four wide through the turn and offered no response when called upon. SABUDA stalked near the inside then angled out on the
turn, exited the turn three wide and weakened. NONE ABOVE THE LAW bothered by rival and checked twice nearing the half-mile pole, entered the turn
along the inside, angled three wide leaving the bend, moved out further in the stretch and flattened out. CARGO chased outside, dropped back while three
then two wide around the turn and weakened. BIG FLAME raced four wide into the lane and was never a factor. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED FOUND MY BALL FROM FOURTH TO SEVENTH FOR DRIFTING IN EARLY AND CAUSING NONE ABOVE THE LAW TO
CHECK TWICE, COSTING HIM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING. HAND-TIMED.
