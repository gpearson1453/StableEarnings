Footnotes
OCEAN LILLY rated with the pace inside then challenged and took the lead nearing the three eighths pole, drew clear toward the five sixteenths, widened
on the far turn and was only briefly asked into the lane, then hand ridden to the finish. GAB'S LIL LEAGUER rounded the opening turn in the three and four
paths then settled off the pace saving ground, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, steadily progressed near the rail on the far turn, though, ultimately settled
for second best. LADY MADISON rated a slim lead off the rail, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths pole, was caught toward the three eighths
pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back approaching the five sixteenths and faded through the far turn. LONGSTORYLUCY raced well off the
pace and off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths pole and passed a rival. SHE FIGURES stalked about the three path, bid nearing the seven
sixteenths pole then faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
THAT'S FOR SURE gave chase from the outside and contested the turn at a close disadvantage while two deep, dueled at even terms through the upper
stretch, took the nod a sixteenth away and edged clear late yards. ASK ME HOW IKNOW angled to the inside to set a pressured pace, contested the edge
nearest the rail on the turn, was met leaving the turn and dueled at even terms through the upper stretch, gave up the nod a sixteenth away then relented
late yards. STERLING GLADIATOR gave chase while angling in nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the turn off the rail, drifted nearing the head of the
lane and closed the gap. ANOTHER MOVE gave chase well off the rail, raced in the three path of the turn and passed a rival late. IRON HENRY chased the
leaders inside, rounded the turn at the rail then weakened. EIGHT OF DIAMONDS was bumped leaving the gate then angled to the outside to give chase,
raced in the five path of the turn and showed little more. CRYPTOBLUE ducked in to make contact with Eight Of Diamonds leaving the gate, raced greenly
while lacking speed early on, but steadily improved the final three eighths.

Footnotes
AZZURRA rounded the opening turn about the three path and settled outside into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, steadily
improved to take the lead four wide leaving the far turn, dueled clear in the upper stretch and widened the final sixteenth. LADY MACHO rated off the pace
and off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in range of the lead in the three path of the far turn, dug in through the stretch and won a
later duel for second. LADY VALENTINA stalked off the rail from the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths and took a brief lead two
deep nearing the quarter pole, but was caught entering the stretch and relented second in a later duel. DAZZLE ME saved ground through the opening turn
then eased outward into the backstretch, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, angled outward through the
upper stretch and finished evenly. KINGSTON TIME raced in the four path the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole then flattened in the four path
of the far turn. GOLD AND STRIKE took the lead past the three quarter pole and rated a short lead, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and
was caught approaching the quarter, continued close at the rail on the far turn then weakened. MIKE'S GIRL was not a factor.

JESS'S RESERVE chased and raced close three wide on the turn, dueled to the front nearing the sixteenth pole and raced clear past the pole. RUNAWAY
CROWN gave chase and raced close off the rail on the turn, then dug in from the head of the lane to take over second later yards. MORE LEVEL surged
clear and angled to the inside to set the pace, raced with the advantage nearest the rail on the turn but was caught mid-stretch and flattened stride the final
sixteenth. THREE BALL gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and ran evenly through the lane. CHAMPTOWN HOPE chased inside, raced
near the rail on the turn then weakened. FINAL TRIBUTE chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little more.
SUPER JODY was not a factor. FIRST CLASS FLIRT chased the leaders and rounded the turn about the seven path.

GOLDDIGGER'S DREAM bobbled at the break and settled off the early pace, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced in the five path of the turn,
was carried wide toward the head of the lane but dug in leaving the turn and took the nod through the final strides. DON'T DARE ME set a pressured pace
through the backstretch and entered the turn two deep, bore out nearing the eighth pole and left the turn in the five path, dug in under steady stretch
encouragement through the stretch but was nosed out the final strides. GRAN WILDROCKY engaged in close chase through the backstretch, raced in the
three and four paths of the turn, dug in down the lane and finished evenly to recover third later yards. FASHIONABLE chased, raced near the rail on the turn
and finished evenly. FIFTY FIFTY pressured the pace inside, dueled at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn then weakened inside the eighth
pole. BULLY DANCER was not a factor. AKTHAM chased off the rail but was taken up nearing the five sixteenths pole and walked off while appearing a bit
sore.

Footnotes
SARAH BELLUM raced in the four path the opening turn and took the lead leaving the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure approaching the three
eighths, rounded the far turn near the rail and was steadily handled to hold on. BABY MELISSA broke inward to make contact with BUSINESS CLASS and
stumbled causing the rider to lose an iron, settled off the pace and off the rail on the opening turn, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced in
the three path of the far turn and was gaining steadily on the winner, while the latter was bumped at the break and steadied off the heels of rivals into the
first turn and kept in check while lacking room through the turn, settled close into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
near the rail then flattened stride the final sixteenth. PLAY CHARADES had her heels clipped shortly after the break then stalked off the rail leaving the nine
sixteenths pole, gave chase from the seven sixteenths and rounded the far turn off the rail, though showed little further. UNEXPECTEDLY broke outward to
make contact with Business Class then clipped the heels of Play Charades and dropped well back to save ground, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths
pole, came through the far turn four wide and showed little more. CHOSEN MISS rounded the opening turn in the four path, raced outside into the
backstretch and never factored. FORT ZANNA came through the first turn about the five path and rated close into the backstretch, picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole, but weakened into the far turn. CHROMATIC bobbled at the break then took over toward the three quarter pole and angled to
the inside, but was taken up past the nine sixteenths pole and vanned off post race.
