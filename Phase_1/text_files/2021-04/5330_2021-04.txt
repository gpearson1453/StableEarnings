Footnotes
OL' L B checked behind rivals near the nine sixteenths pole, shifted out five wide, advanced steadily on the turn, battled the length of the stretch and proved
best under right handed urging two wide. LITTLE BLAKER bore out t the start, rallied three wide to engage the leaders on the turn, dueled with the winner
the balance of the trip along the inside and finished second best. CANT BUY COOL stalked the pace and went evenly. OBSESSIONSOPTIMIST broke
slowly, lacked racing room along the inside into the turn, shifted out to the six path and finished with good courage. REBEL'S REVENGE dueled for the early
lead two wide, led through the turn then weakened late inside. TANCAHUA was no factor. CAPTAIN RILEY was no threat. IRON MEN OF METZ contested
the early lead along the inside, stopped in upper stretch and was eased to the wire.

turn, drifted out at the top of the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. MAKE THE RULES offered a bid two wide through the far turn, was in tight at the top
of the stretch between horses causing his rider to steady then dropped back. IRISH PROUD failed to menace. KNOCKOUT RANGER was no threat.

RIDGE WEST never far back, split horses two wide through deep stretch and proved best by the narrowest of margins while fully extended. EXPRIMIR
dueled for the lead two wide in the three and four paths, led late and just missed hanging on. TALE OF LACEY stalked the pace into the stretch then lacked
the needed response. QUALITY MAN well placed, moved up four wide through the turn then failed to sustain that bid. EL MARRO battled for the lead along
the rail until deep stretch then weakened. POWERS OUT vied for the lead five wide and was through after a half. KANDY CHARGE was no factor.
KINGDOM DIAMOND was outrun. SPIN DOCTOR reared at the start and unseated his rider. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK

Footnotes
AMIGO'S AFFAIR battled for the lead along the inside through the turn, drifted to the three path, shook clear late and just lasted. KRAMMY BOY unhurried
early, swung wide, closed fast in the middle of the racetrack and just missed. D'MONEY HONEY trailed into the turn then closed determinedly five wide late.
KEYED ON TOP never far back, was gaining ground late along the inside. PACIFIC IMAGE close up, loomed boldly three wide nearing the top of the
stretch then was outfinished. LOCK ON never far back, finished with good courage in the six path. ODIE pressed the pace three then two wide into the
stretch then faded. ANECHOIC was through after a half. ROSKILDE contested the lead two wide into the stretch and weakened late. ARTAVIA was no
factor. JUNIOR GILLIAM was outrun.
