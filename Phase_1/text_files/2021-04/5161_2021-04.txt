Footnotes
WILD ESCAPE three wide into the first turn, settled middle half, advanced, bid in the two path second turn, long duel to the wire, proved narrowly best in a
determined effort. CHEWY CHEWY GOOD pressed the early leader off the inside, advanced and took over from that one into the far turn, dueled inside the
winner the length of the stretch, proved stubborn to the end. GREAT IN RED three wide into the first turn, moved inside while forwardly placed the middle
half, continued to save ground final turn, could do little with the top two in the drive, well clear of the others. OMI TEN broke out to bother SOUPER
CAPACITY, one paced while in mid pack, lacked a closing response. SOUPER CAPACITY settled off the pace, continued in mid pack, improved slightly
while not a serious threat. SISTEROFTHEMOON void of speed, passed tiring rivals while not a serious threat. LYRICIST bothered at the break to be off
slowly, raced back, moved out three wide for the second turn, made little impact in picking off a couple of tiring rivals. INNERVOICE settled off the pace
inside, had little for the stretch run. QUIET SURPRISE five wide into the first turn, remained always back. B REWARDING showed the way into the first turn,
dueled briefly the second quarter then stopped in the far turn.

Footnotes
BODE'S MAKER allowed the pace to go early inside, off the inside in the run up the angled out to range up and challenge in the four path late in the final
turn, drew clear under his own courage and steadily increased that advantage the final furlong to win ridden out. CASHANOVA last to leave, void of speed
while along the inside, continued to save ground into the far turn, tipped out late in the final turn, finished well but was not match for the winner, clearly
second best. CATDADDY dueled up front closest to but not on the inside, continued to alternate in the two the middle half while in hand, offered little
resistance to the winner or runner up the final three sixteenth, prevailed for the show over fellow pacesetter. DEFENDER alternated up front while racing off
the inside, weakened in the drive, outfinished for the show. COAL TRUTH broke back, failed to menace. IRISH HOKIE finished early, fell further and further
back, jogged in.

Footnotes

front past the furlong marker, drove clear. DESTINEDTOBEASTAR broke back, raced well off the early pace inside worked way out to be three wide into the
lane, steered out further, finished full of run to be clear late for the place, no real threat to the winner. SMELLIN CANDY within striking distance out in the
strip, ranged up four wide to challenge late in the turn, vied into the lane, brushed with BOO BE RIGHT nearing the furlong marker, weakened the final
furlong. BOO BE RIGHT with the pace three wide, continued to do battle while between horses into the stretch, brushed with SMELLIN CANDY nearing
midstretch then was outkicked by that rival for the show. TEN BUDS broke alertly, vied up front while between rivals, gave way in the drive.
ROCKTHEPULPIT lacked speed well off the inside, three to four wide late in the turn, not dangerous through the stretch. GOOSE ALMIGHTY lacked speed,
four wide late in the turn, failed to muster a rally. IT'S BELLAMY TIME raced in mid pack, two path through the turn, faded through the stretch. RUSTY
CAGE fractious in the gate prior to the break, broke in good order, vied up front along the inside for a half, faltered in the drive. DEMIGOD broke through the
gate prior to the start, fell back to trail after the start, showed little.

Footnotes
UNIDENTIFIED MAN outrun early inside, pulled in the run onto the backstretch, steered out to be five wide turning for home, closed with good resolve to be
up in time. HANKS bobbled slightly at the start to break back, was used to move up and press the issue three wide before a quarter, took over and was
clear turning for home, continued to hold the advantage late, gave ground grudgingly in the final strides to the winner. CONTACT TRACING settled in mid
pack off the inside, moved closer three wide turning into the stretch, chased the runner up past the furlong marker, flattened late between the top two, saved
the show. CAPTAIN FANTASTIC forwardly placed off the inside, also lacked a closing kick. GAINER lacked speed off the inside, came three wide and a bit
closer into the lane, went one paced late to also lacked a winning response. WICK void of speed, continued back, passed a couple of tiring rivals while
never a threat. SLEIGHT OF HAND settled in mid pack early, tired. DISTRACTANDATTACK broke alertly, set or forced the pace, gave way. FLAT
REWARD last away, back off the early pace in some traffic first turn, lodged a middle on the outside to reach a striking position before a half, stopped far
turn, finished far back in jogging in.

Footnotes
BACKGATE BELLE void of speed toward the inside, three out to four wide when still well back turning for home, still had a lot of work to do the final furlong,
closed big gap late to be up in time. TALLANDLONG chased the leader, took over from that one turning into the lane, held a large advantage late, fell apart
in the final strides to be nipped at the wire. COURTNEY FAY four wide into the first turn, settled off the pace and the inside, three wide when one paced into
the lane, finished best of the rest. VERY SPICY broke on top, set all the pace while racing inside, faltered when headed turning into the lane, continued to
give way to lose a couple of more positions in the final sixteenth. ALITTLEBITOFSMARTY broke out, bumped, off the pace into the first turn, bounced off the
rail early in that bend, went evenly thereafter in lacking a closing response. SPOT'S MAINE GIRL carried out six wide into the first turn, continued well wide
to be four wide onto the backstretch, four wide through the second turn, passed tiring rivals to improve position a bit in the stretch. PRECIOUS TINKLE
bumped, pinched back start, raced in mid pack the middle four furlongs, had little left for the drive. NO DIRECT MATCHES forwardly placed for four
furlongs, retreated. FEMININE ALLURE carried out seven wide into the first turn, angled in a bit through that bend, failed to muster a response in the drive.
CADDO QUEEN got out into the first turn, stopped and finished far back while jogging in.

KASSERINE PASS off the pace and the inside, continued to track the leaders while saving ground turn, tipped out two wide entering the stretch, bid
between foes, long drive, all out. JETS A GINNIN steadily cleared to the inside opening quarter, showed the way through the turn, remained clear upper
stretch, responded when confronted by the winner soon after then proved stubborn to the end. LIL MISS HOT MESS in the second flight while racing
outside, came four wide into the stretch, not enough in the late going for the top two while remaining outside that pair. FLEETA BELLE last to leave, saved
ground to no avail to finish up evenly. SACRED STORM chased the runner up for a half off the inside and gave way. WAR BALLAD trailed throughout in
showing little.

MELTING SNOW in the second flight up the backstretch off the inside, three wide when challenging into the lane, edged clear under firm handling.
SIMONA'S CHOICE forwardly placed while off the rail, challenged in the two path late in the turn, showed the way into the lane, responded when challenged
by the winner soon after, gave ground grudgingly to that rival, clearly second best. CREDIT ENHANCEMENT bothered slightly at the break, raced outside
and back off the pace, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, no match for the top two late. BOSSY MOMENT broke back, raced well off the pace inside,
continued to save ground through the turn and improved into the lane, could not get to the top three late, finished up evenly. FACTUAL in mid pack while
racing off the inside, three wide through the turn, lacked a signficant closing response. SECRET MISTRESS forwardly placed for a half along the inside, in
some traffic turning for home, came up empty for the drive when clear. DOUBLE DARE YOU broke alertly, cleared early, offered little resistance to the
runner up when that one challenged late in the turn, steadily weakened in the drive. SCAT FOR THE CAUSE failed to menace. PARKIN IN THE REAR
unprepared at the start, broke outward and into the gate with head turned, unseated rider.

Footnotes
ROYAL DAAHER with the pace off the inside, raced three wide when vying the turn, dueled out of the bend, shook clear under pressure, geared down a bit
late in a sharp effort. LYKAN void of speed off the inside three out to four wide turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive while rallying for the place.
FULL AUTHORITY within striking distance outside, three wide out of the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, lacked a closing punch and was
caught late for the place. MO'S MOJO allowed to settle while racing off the inside, in the two path through the turn, continued in even fashion through the
lane in lacking a closing kick. PLANE TALK broke sharp along the in side, dueled up front inside the winner for four furlongs, faltered in the drive. WAR
DETONATOR shuffled back in the early going, failed to menace. STURGILL broke a step slow, moved up to race in the second flight, had nothing for the
drive. SKOL FACTOR finished early, gave way completely late in the turn, jogged in.

Footnotes
HAMAZING SONG behind the pace while off the inside, steered out three wide for room in some traffic turning for home, set down, finished willingly to be up
in time. MRS. BEANS bothered at the start to be off slowly, raced back and inside, closer along the inside of traffic into the lane, moved out a bit for room
the final furlong, finished well while once again in traffic to narrowly miss. PRINCE LEO within striking distance along the inside and in hand, closer while
continuing just off the inside for the drive, moved back to the rail with a furlong remaining, loomed a threat to challenge late but was found lacking in the final
strides. ASPEN CLUB prompted the early leader off the inside, prompted the early leader in the two path, took over from that one entering the stretch,
showed the way past the furlong marker then faltered late to lose several positions. AFRICAN WARRIOR off the pace and outside, four wide into the lane,
five wide turning for home, went evenly to the wire while remaining widest in the drive. PAY DIRT broke sharp, soon sprinted clear and to the inside, faltered
in the late going. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP lacked speed, three wide turning for home, never menaced. THORNISH fell back off the pace, four wide trip, never
a factor. CHICKEN HAWK forwardly placed early, three to four wide turn, steadily faded.
