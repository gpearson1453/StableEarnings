Footnotes
DEREK'S BOY gave chase and drew alongside EPIC WEST two deep approaching the top of the stretch, then dug in under steady encouragement to take
the nod the final stride, while the latter angled to the inside early and set the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, contested the
advantage nearest the rail on the turn and dug in under steady stretch encouragement, but was nipped the final stride. R BOY EVENS steadied off the heels
of Epic West leaving the chute then picked up the chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, dug in under steady handling down the lane,
finished well and just missed. FIREBIRD was crowded and steadied while making contact with Dynamic Day leaving the chute then picked up the chase,
rounded the turn off the rail, angled to the five path approaching the head of the lane and finished well. INDIAN SOUND gave chase, raced off the rail on the
turn and showed little further. DYNAMIC DAY was bumped early, picked up the chase through the backstretch, raced in the three and four paths of the turn
then weakened. FERNWOOD DRIVE gave chase while racing wide. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Epic West for interference
leaving the chute, lodged by the rider of R Boy Evens, determined that the infraction also affected the progress of Firebird and disqualified Epic West to
fourth place.

Footnotes
AUTS REVOLUTION took the lead into the first turn and moved to the inside to rate a clear pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole,
widened at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled down the lane. ROSAS WAY stalked the earlier pace then bid nearing the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail but ultimately settled for second best. ASTRO RIDER rated off the pace in the three and four paths, bid nearing the
seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. CAMPARI raced well off the early pace while saving ground then
eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and passed a rival. NEW AFLEET raced off the
early pace about the three path, bid toward the three eighths pole but faded near the rail on the far turn. COMPROMISO showed no response while saving
ground.

Footnotes
BANNER MAN was hustled along with the early pace, pulled himself clear past the quarter pole then dug in under steady stretch encouragement to widen
the final sixteenth. BECOMING SMITTY gave chase off the rail and dug in through the lane to retain second. MINDYOURPSANDQS engaged in close early
chase, raced four wide on the turn and finished evenly at the outside flank of the runner-up. HENRY STANDINGBEAR gave chase outside, raced five wide
on the turn then flattened stride. STOLEN BIZ chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail, eased out into the lane but had little left. WINDSOR'S FUN was
hustled with the pace inside, but dropped back past the quarter pole and weakened at the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
SPUNMAN rounded the first turn about the four path then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead three wide approaching the top of the stretch,
dueled clear mid-stretch and was steadily handled to widen the final sixteenth. SLEW THE TURN raced in the five path the first turn and settled off the pace
into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the three path and dug in through the lane to take
second later yards. MORGAN COUNTY stalked off the rail the first turn and took the nod past the half mile pole, dueled with the edge through the
backstretch and most of the far turn, but was caught approaching the top of the stretch, dropped back a sixteenth away and flattened out. NORTHERN
RIDGE settled back off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then passed some rivals in the lane.
SPANGLISH rated close to the early pace about the three path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then weakened at the rail on the far
turn. FLASHY READY RICK surged to the lead and angled to the inside to set the early pace, was met and gave up the nod leaving the half mile pole,
dueled near the rail from that point but dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened. ANY WAY NOW raced well back from contention, gave chase
from the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path.

Footnotes
BRIGINTINE ISLAND tapered in to stalk about the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole and took the lead three wide approaching the quarter pole,
drew clear through the far turn and was steadily encouraged to draw off. SEE YA MANANA settled just off the pace while saving early ground, bid leaving
the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, then dug in through the lane to hold onto second. MALIBU SPLASH settled off the pace
and off the rail the opening turn, bid from the seven sixteenths pole, drifted to the six path on the far turn and finished evenly to take third mid-stretch.
POWER FORWARD rated off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn six wide and passed a rival in the lane. CAMERON STREET
raced well back from early contention then eased out into the backstretch, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, drifted into the
stretch and passed rivals in an even finish. ALPINE MOON raced off the pace about the three path the first turn and showed little response down the
backstretch. AMELIA BEDELIA rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, gave up the advantage approaching the quarter,
raced at the rail on the far turn then weakened. SHERWOOD LADY stalked two deep then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled from that
point but weakened midway on the far turn. LADY MADISON became anxious in the gate and raced well back. ADDY'S LOVE settled off the pace in the
three and four paths the first turn then showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
TIZEZZY broke a step slow, steadied early and dropped well off the early pace, bid leaving the half mile pole, steadily improved and rounded the far turn five
wide, dug in widest leaving the turn and took the lead the final strides under a hand ride. BELLOWS settled just off the early pace off the rail then stalked
three wide into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole and dueled at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn, dug in to take a slim brief
lead deep stretch but was outfinished through the final strides. CAVALLOTTO rated close to the early pace inside, challenged leaving the three eighths pole
and took the lead two deep toward the five sixteenths, contested the advantage off the rail on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane but was caught
flattening stride the final yards. GUNS OF STEEL moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and gave up
the nod toward the five sixteenths, then dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened. GOODBYESEEULATER checked off the heels of
rivals and angled four wide into the opening turn, left the turn outside and bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, continued four wide on the far turn then
flattened the final furlong. THREE TO THIRTEEN saved ground the opening turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened at the
rail on the far turn. BAY HILL rated off the pace about the three path the first turn and was four wide into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole then weakened off the rail rounding the far turn.
