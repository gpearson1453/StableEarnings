Footnotes
MAKE ME BLUSH stalked the pace of BARBARA'S CHAMP while racing four-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a
clear margin with a furlong to run and drew off as a handy winner. MAKE GOOD CHOICES raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, could
not gain on the winner in the drive but finished with good late energy. MAD CATTER was forwardly placed throughout, moved four-wide through the turn
and finished with some late run to gain the show. BARBARA'S CHAMP sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and gave way through
the final furlong. CHUCKIES CHANCE was never far back, raced five-wide through the turn, moved up for a striking position nea4ring the three-sixteenths
pole and gave way in the drive. BOOZYMILKSHAKEBAR lacked early foot, raced seven-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LUCKY CARLENE was bumped at the break, tracked the pace of DOMESTICATION from the inside, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and wore that
rival down in the closing yards. DOMESTICATION was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run but could
not resist the winner late. LITTLE MISS BELLE pressed the pace of DOMESTICATION while racing three-wide and gave way after going three-quarters.
TIPARILLO raced four-wide through both turns, settled off the leaders throughout and finished evenly. MS SALLY was bumped at the start, steadied nearing
the seven-eighths marker, moved three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. SUNRISER raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide
through the second turn and failed to rally. REALREALGOOD was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and did not menace.

PACIFIC SILENCE was away in good order to duel for the lead with SWEET REGARDS from the inside, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and
drew off with complete authority. RUN FOR BELLE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached a striking position into
the stretch, could not match strides with the winner but finished well to gain the place. SWEET REGARDS disputed the pace with the winner while racing
four-wide and gave way after going a half. LUCKY SOCKS was forwardly placed from the inside throughout and failed to gain in the drive. R ALLIE lacked
early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CHICKA LINA was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not
menace. LOVELY LEGEND veered in at the start, hit the rail and was pulled up.

Footnotes
SHARPSHOOTINGEORGE raced four-wide through the first turn then was allowed to settle, advanced six-wide through the second turn, responded when
set down for the drive and was up with a rush to prevail in the closing yards. HERDSMAN settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second
turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run but could not resist the winner late. PLEASE DO TELL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the second turn, offered a bid in tandem with HERDSMAN nearing the sixteenth pole but could not match strides late. SIZZLING EVENING set a
pressured pace from off the rail, responded when challenged nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. OUT ON SATURDAY raced off the
pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a belated bid. THE KOHEN pressed the
pace from the inside for five furlongs and weakened. GERDA'S GONE raced off the leaders early, moved seven-wide through the second turn and was not
a factor. DON'S FINAL FINAL pressed the pace while racing four-wide, offered a bid nearing the three-eighths marker and weakened soon after. STARSHIP
CHEWY was off slow, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. GIMME SPACE was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the
second turn and did not menace.

ONTHEWINGSOFADREAM broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the stretch and held off the closing
VIDAKS BACK to prevail. VIDAKS BACK settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with a steady gain. TRES CHIFLADOS
lacked early foot, raced seven-wide through the turn and showed good late energy. VIVID FEVER was reserved just off the leaders early, steadied nearing
the half, moved five-wide through the turn and finished willingly. NOVA was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the
needed late response. ZOMBIE ALAN raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. HERMANO was off slow then
allowed to settle, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TOWARDS THE LIGHT disputed the pace while racing four-wide for a half and
weakened.
