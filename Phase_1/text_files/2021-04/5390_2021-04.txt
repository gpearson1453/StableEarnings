Footnotes
FIRST CAPTAIN along the inside briefly, chased just off the inside in aim of the front before tipping three wide through the turn coming under light coaxing,
got paused in behind rivals at the three-eighths before being re-engaged by the rider near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a
drive and got on track nearing the final sixteenth to close well through to the finish taking command in the final jumps to the wire to prevail. MAHAAMEL
established the front shortly after the start showing the way in hand from the two path, had REPO ROCKS advance into the turn and was headed for
command nearing the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, took back the front with
three-sixteenths to go and edged away under a drive inside the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat and was caught in the final strides to the finish.
REPO ROCKS coaxed from the gate, raced three wide in range albeit near the rear of the compacted field, advanced at the nine-sixteenths between rivals
to issue a challenge for command and took over narrowly with three furlongs to go, continued three wide into upper stretch under threat, dug in and was
displaced at the three-sixteenths, weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. BODE O forwardly placed six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, went four to five wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened. PIPELINE chased four
to five wide striding a bit greenly through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and weakened. ONE
WHIRLWIND RIDE away well and to the front, prompted the pace of MAHAAMEL from the outside in the five path early on before tucking four wide through
the turn, began to get shaken off and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, faded and went four wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.
GHOSTCONQUEROR coaxed from the start, chased briefly inside before tipping to the two path shortly after, came under coaxing midway on the turn,
angled out six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CLASSIC COLORS dropped to the rear, was unhurried at the back under reserve while racing three wide, continued at the rear while patiently ridden on the
far turn, was roused while swinging seven wide into the stretch, rallied on the far outside, closed strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then
moved clear under good handling. ENGLISH BREEZE was last to commence, became keen under tight restraint early, tugged hard at the bit onto the
backstretch, was reserved under a snug hold while racing two to three wide, came under urging outside the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper
stretch while being passed by the winner and finished with good energy for the place. MAGNETIQUE was taken in hand early, raced inside early on the
initial dogleg leaving the chute then moved to the two path, stalked outside under a hold on the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the three path, was
asked at the quarter-pole then took the lead into upper stretch, inched clear nearing the furlong marker, was collared outside the sixteenth-pole then
outfinished while just able to get the show. PANDAMOM was taken in hand early then rated three to four wide, remained patient under restraint through the
far turn, was asked after straightening for the drive, pursued the leader into the final furlong and was out-kicked then just missed the show. SKY KITTEN
dropped from the two path to the rail on the initial run out of the chute and onto the backstretch, was well rated while setting the pace through moderate
fractions, vied inside on the far turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole then lost the advantage into upper stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final
furlong and weakened. CARA'S DREAMER went four wide on the initial dogleg out of the chute and onto the backstretch, settled on the outside, rounded
the far turn in the four path, was given her cue outside the five-sixteenths then driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
DESTINATIONWNRSCIR dropped from the two path to the inside on the slight bend out of the chute, was rated off the pace, saved ground on the far turn,
was roused outside the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch in the two path, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong, ducked out under a left-handed
crop in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and failed to respond. TEMPORARY RAIL WAS SET AT NINE FEET WITH THE EXEPTION OF THE FAR TURN
WHICH WAS SET AT EIGHTEEN FEET

Footnotes
THE QUEENS JULES three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home and cornered three wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive offering up late foot to close stoutly outside and was just up in the shadow of the wire to score. MR PHIL hustled from the gate, showed the
way early on under pressure from LATIN CASINO to the outside, tucked inside through the turn and had that foe advance knocking heads while widening
away from the rest through to the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to inside the eighth pole, dug in growing a
bit leg weary under lone late threat to the outside and was nailed in the very last jump to the finish. MISTER WINSTON six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
belated bid to be along for the show honors. LATIN CASINO coaxed from the start, prompted the leader from the outside while four to five paths off the rail,
tucked to the two path through the turn and advanced to duel through the bend shaking away from the rest of the field as a team, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off, grew leg weary drifting inwards and then outwards near the furlong
grounds and weakened through to the finish. SOMEBODY four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and offered no response. THIN WHITE DUKE fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch
before tucking to the rail through the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PUBLICATION tucked from the four path to the three path under tight restraint on the first turn, pulled hard on the bit while keen under a snug hold onto and
early on the backstretch, was reserved on the outside while given some cover, went two to three wide on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole,
rallied four wide into the stretch, closed strongly to make a bid outside the furlong marker, took the lead inside that marker and prevailed under strong
urging. HIGH OPINION brushed with a foe shortly after the break, was unhurried at the rear while saving ground, swung three wide into upper stretch while
put to the crop, moved out under a drive approaching the furlong marker and finished with good energy but was too late while able to get the place.
STOLEN HOLIDAY went to the front while inside on the first turn, showed the way a bit off the inside down the backstretch while inside of a rival, continued
inside that foe in the two path on the far turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, switched back to her inside lead
under heavy threat coming to the furlong marker, lost the advantage just inside that marker and was outfinished but earned the show. PRINCESS FAWZIA
prompted the pace on the outside in the three path, was the first of the front two to be asked outside the quarter-pole, battled on even terms for the lead in
upper stretch, fought with two foes into the final furlong then the winner until near the sixteenth-pole and weakened. I HEAR YOU dropped from the three
path to the rail on the first turn, settled comfortably off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was roused inside the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed
response. CHEROKEE SONG brushed with a foe after the start then tossed her head while taken back, was reserved near the rear, went three then four
wide on the far turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths then driven five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong to take command inside the final

inside the sixteenth marker, ran on to preserve the place honors. HAMMERIN AAMER bumped at the start by ROAMING UNION, who broke inwards,
chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home,
got paused in behind rivals at the three-sixteenths before being re-engaged by the rider as room opened up, then offered up a mild kick to miss for the place

outside five paths off the rail, tucked to the two path through the turn getting put to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, got on near
even terms for command at the three-sixteenths, then weakened in the late stages. ROAMING UNION broke in at the start brushing the gate and bumping

inside for home, yielded the front nearing the eighth pole, fought on briefly before weakening to the finish. KUMAR bumped at the start by CHIEF KNOW IT

Footnotes
SHAFTESBURY established a good position towards the front, settled into a comfortable stride, moved closer while inside on the far turn, was asked
outside the quarter-pole then shifted three wide into the stretch, rallied to the lead at the three-sixteenths, shook clear into the final furlong and proved best
under strong urging. MUTASALLEM settled towards the middle of the field, went three wide under urging on the far turn, swung six wide into upper stretch
and finished willingly for the place. CAMBI LION settled towards the rear on the outside, was roused while four wide on the far turn then came five wide into
the stretch, shifted out eight wide near the three-sixteenths and finished with good energy to just miss the place while up for the show. CAVEAT EMPTOR
settled nicely off the pace while off the inside, was roused in the two path on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick
then missed the trifecta. HOMBRE was taken up after the start, settled at the rear of the field, moved from three to five wide on the far turn, gained seven
wide into upper stretch but flattened out and lacked the needed response. NEWSWORTHY was asked leaving the gate, went to the front then was taken in
hand, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked in the vicinity of the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the
winner under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. FLYING WITH ANGELS bumped with a rival at the start then came
inward, settled well back in the field, moved from the two path to the four path on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and failed to threaten.
BAIL OUT settled on the outside, went four wide on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole then came five wide into the stretch and had nothing
left. MANDATORY stayed out seven wide leaving the chute and onto the backstretch, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the far
turn, dropped back under urging late on that bend, came four wide into the stretch and tired. WELSHMAN showed early speed on the inside then was taken
back off the pace, settled near the middle of the field down the backstretch, saved ground while roused on the far turn and failed to respond. RUDY ROD

Footnotes
LOOKING AT BIKINIS two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, tipped out with
three-sixteenths to go three paths for clearance and closed well to issue a challenge inside the final sixteenth taking command forty yards from home and
edged away to the wire to prevail. AMERICAN POWER established the front and showed the way lightly coaxed just off the inside under pressure from
SOUPER STONEHENGE to the outside, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive stubbornly holding command until collared in the late
stages. WICKED TRICK four to five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the
finish to secure the show honors. MIHOS broke through the gate prior to the start inspiring SOUPER STONEHENGE and T LOVES A FIGHT to do the
same, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing into the turn and got put to a drive three furlongs from home, swung four wide to five wide into
upper stretch and improved position by tired foes. SOUPER STONEHENGE broke through the gate just after MIHOS and was reloaded, broke out at the
start and got corrected, prompted the leader four then three wide from the outside and was set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive prominent to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. T LOVES A FIGHT broke open the gate just after a pair of rivals broke through the
gate, then lunged his way from the hands of the assistant starter to jog his way along with that pair before being reloaded, broke out at the start and was
corrected, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no kick.

Footnotes
CASA CREED was reserved towards the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, was roused while shifting three wide into the stretch, moved out under a
drive in pursuit of the leading quartet into the final furlong and closed determinedly to get up in the final strides. FRONT RUN THE FED brushed with a foe at
the start, was rated on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was given his cue at the quarter-pole, made an outside bid in upper stretch, battled outside
of three foes into the final furlong, gained a short lead late but was denied while narrowly able to get the place. VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) was rated just
off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader while inside to the two path on the turn, was asked after turning into the stretch then awaited room
behind the leading trio, squeezed through in very tight quarters to make a bid between foes into the final furlong, bumped with PROVEN STRATEGIES
while fighting still in crowded quarters between foes outside the sixteenth-pole, fought gamely to the wire and just missed while narrowly able to get the
show. TELL YOUR DADDY stalked the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was asked after straightening for the drive, fought on well on
even terms for the lead between horses into the final furlong, battled determinedly to the wire and just missed. OLYMPIC RUNNER brushed with an
opponent at the start, settled at the rear of the field, went around the turn in the two path, was roused outside the quarter-pole, swung six wide into the
stretch and finished with late energy. THERAPIST was rated off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was given his cue outside the quarter-pole
then was driven four wide into the stretch before moving further out and lacked the needed kick. PROVEN STRATEGIES came away in front, showed the
way down the backstretch, vied inside of a foe while along the rail on the turn, was asked after turning into the stretch then came under a drive, lost the
advantage just inside the furlong marker, bumped with a foe outside the sixteenth then checked and weakened. SEISMIC WAVE settled on the outside,
went three to four wide on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths then driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. TEMPORARY

near side stall at the start before bumping MED SCHOOL MICHAEL, chased four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued four wide into
upper stretch and kept on through to the finish to secure the show honors. FLIPPING FUN chased four then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs
out, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and kept on through the stretch. FREUDIAN ANALYST chased three wide until tucked to the inside half a mile
from home, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. STRONG DESIRE broke in at the

at the start and got away last conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home
and made no impact. MED SCHOOL MICHAEL got bumped at the start by RATCHET who broke inwards, then got bumped just after by CANYON OF

came under challenge nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front with about three-sixteenths to run and tired. ALITE
