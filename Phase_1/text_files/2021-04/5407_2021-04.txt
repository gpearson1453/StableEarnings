Footnotes
INTERNET OF THINGS tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing the far turn while being prompted
to advance, steadily gained on the leaders in a prolonged drive into the stretch and edged forward under right handed encouragement. WHISTLE ME
HOME was urged disputing the pace on a narrow advantage inside rivals racing a bit off the rail to the far turn, dueled between foes through the second
bend to midstretch and weakened late. TIP SHEET, forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, tracked just off the leaders while angling to the
inside nearing the far turn, pressed the issue inside foes through the far turn past midstretch but weakened late. BRANDT tracked off the second flight while
racing three wide into the far turn and continued evenly into the stretch. SHAKEM N BREAKEM settled inside a rival as part of the last flight, shifted out
racing into upper stretch but lacked a rally. UNSPOILED MOMENTS settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch and never seriously
menaced. TRULY STELLAR, urged prompting the pace three wide racing to the backstretch, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
AKSARBEN SUMMER broke sharply, tracked the pacesetter outside a rival racing through the backstretch, continued with a steady bid to press the issue
on the turn, shook clear racing into upper stretch and widened the advantage under pressure. SENORITA AURORA, forwardly placed between foes in the
opening stages, angled inwards tracking just off the pacesetter to the turn, switched out nearing upper stretch and continued in pursuit of the winner while
proving only second best. MILENITA, off slowly, gathered some momentum outside foes on the turn, was fanned to the six path nearing upper stretch but
continued with some late interest to improve position. UNITEDTORUN settled outside foes in early stages, angled to the five path nearing upper stretch
while being prompted to gain some position but had no final kick. WORTH IT broke slowly and never gained contention. MIAMI GOLD, urged to the lead
racing a bit off the rail racing to the turn, contested the issue inside the winner and gave way into upper stretch. KITTENS MISS MOJO dropped out early.

Footnotes
VANA GRAND was urged inside foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, went clear after a half, dueled
inside foes entering the far turn, was headed nearing upper stretch but continued resolutely to turn back her rivals and go clear through the stretch under
firm handling. DREAMINOFDASIES tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, conceded some position while easing outside foes racing into the far
turn, then continued four wide in the closing stages to edge a rival for the place honors late. A FOOLISH FANCY tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in
second flight in early stages, gained some position along the rail racing into the far turn, shifted off the inside entering the lane but had no late kick. CSILLA
settled outside foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to gain some position while being fanned five wide into the lane but
continued with interest in an even effort. VAN KHOZAN tracked off the first flight three deep to the backstretch, advanced in that path to lodge a brief bid
outside the winner on the far turn but flattened out nearing midstretch. HIGHRHYTHMDIXIE, caught a bit wide racing to the first turn, angled to the inside
racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. R D BLESSING, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace to the backstretch, faded from
contention early.

Footnotes
ROSE'S CAUSE was rated along the inside dropping well off the second flight in the opening half, gained some position inside foes nearing upper stretch,
shifted out three wide entering the lane, then was roused to take charge and go clear under firm handling. CHARLITA settled last while angling inside racing
into the backstretch, was prompted to advance while angling out four wide racing through the stretch and narrowly prevailed for the place honors in time.
SAYOH angled to the rail tracking off the first flight under rating to the backstretch, tipped out nearing upper stretch to press the pacesetter into the lane but
yielded to the top pair late. DONYA'S MAGIC, urged to the lead along the inside leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn,
dueled inside foes to upper stretch and gave way. AIR FORCE PINK settled outside a rival dropping off the second flight to the backstretch and lacked a
closing response. LIMONATA angled inwards racing to the first turn while being urged prompting the pacesetter to the far turn, gave way into the lane.
RACE DAY SPEED tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight to the far turn and came up empty nearing the lane. VIKING QUEEN tracked off the
second flight in the opening half, raced three wide into the far turn and faded early.

Footnotes
R BOY BODE, urged to the lead while angling inwards racing to the turn, held sway on a narrow margin through the turn, was roused to widen the
advantage entering upper stretch but drifted out late while holding BETWEENHEREANDCOOL on a safe margin. The latter tracked off the second flight
while angling to the inside racing into the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch advancing on the pacesetter, but altered course inside the winner when
momentarily losing his path in the closing stages. SECRET LIFE STYLE settled outside foes dropping off the second flight racing to the turn, swung out five
wide in the lane and continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair. CITY STORM was rated along the inside dropping well off the leaders into the turn,
saved ground to upper stretch and continued to improve position. SOLITARY JACK settled last while angling to the inside, swung out six wide racing into
upper stretch but offered only a mild rally. CHIEF WHITE SOX angled inwards to track the pacesetter outside foes in second flight, continued outside a rival
to the lane and faded in upper stretch. STRIKING HEIR, urged to a forward placing along the inside racing just off the pacesetter, steadied momentarily in
tight quarters entering the bend, continued along the inside to upper stretch and quickly came up empty. ARCHIVERO made brief pursuit of the pacesetter
between foes, was taken up avoiding tight quarters leaving the half mile marker, drifted out racing into the lane and steadily faded. FOLLOWING THE
RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
PUDDING, in touch with the leaders three wide between rivals attending the pace through the backstretch, pressed the issue in that path entering the turn,
dueled for command outside a rival into upper stretch and edged forward to a narrow advantage under firm handling. LORD BARNA, urged inside rivals
prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch, resisted the winner to late stages but proved only
second best. WELD was settled last along the inside in the opening half, saved ground on the turn gathering momentum nearing upper stretch, tipped out
and continued with a steady late effort between foes to prevail for a share on the wire. MR. WHO, urged between foes dictating the pace on a narrow margin
to the turn, dueled between foes to the lane and gave way near midstretch. ELGAR, forwardly placed four wide tracking just off the first flight, continued in
pursuit of the leaders in that path into the turn and gave way into the stretch. DIVINE AMBITION tracked just off the first flight between foes and faded early.

Footnotes
VIGO was rated off the first flight between rivals racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling into the far turn, shifted out four wide racing
through the stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest a clear advantage under firm handling. ONE MOST WANTED tracked off the second flight
racing to the backstretch, split foes while being prompted to advance with a sharp move racing into the far turn, moved to challenge three deep entering the
lane but couldn't match the winner's kick. MONITOR MILLS broke readily, angled to the inside setting the pace to the backstretch, was urged clear into the
far turn, dueled inside foes into upper stretch and yielded to the top pair late. BIG POLO angled inwards to track just off the first flight racing to the
backstretch, gained position along the inside racing into upper stretch but had no final kick. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA, forwardly placed three wide attending the
pace, couldn't match the pacesetter entering the far turn and gave way into the stretch. BEACH BANDIT settled along the inside, angled out racing into
upper stretch but had no rally. UNCLE ARMANDO settled outside a rival in the last flight and passed only tiring foes. NOTHIN REALLY tracked the leaders
inside rivals in second flight and faded early. BLACK LIMO tracked the leaders three wide in second flight to the backstretch and faded into the far turn.
TOLL GATE, urged to a forward placing between foes, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
OPTIMAL COURAGE hopped at the start while breaking last, was urged between foes to gain a forward placing in the opening stages, tracked the
pacesetter from out of striking distance into the turn, shifted to three path in upper stretch and continued with a steady late effort to wrest command and go
clear under firm handling. STERLING ICE broke readily, sprinted well clear of the field a bit off rail racing into the turn, held sway on a commanding
advantage into upper stretch but faltered late. VET'S GIFT tracked the pacesetter outside a rival as part of the second flight, shifted inwards racing into the
lane and continued evenly late. SWAMP WATER tracked off the second flight along the inside to the turn but offered no closing bid.
NEVERENOUGHCOCO tracked off the second flight three wide racing into the turn and faded into upper stretch. DISTINCTIVE LAD, bumped at the start,
was righted to track off the second flight between rivals but came up empty nearing the lane. DIALED IN GOLD broke outwards bumping a rival at the start,
settled well off the leaders and proved no threat. PLEASANT WISH was outpaced early, trailed the field into the stretch, fell to the track after the race when
appearing to suffer the effects of heat stroke, then was vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
DRILLOMATIC raced between foes in second flight leaving the chute, angled to the inside on the first turn to track just off those rivals, steadily advanced to
contention along the rail racing to the far turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch to challenge for command and went clear under firm left handed
encouragement. BEE MAJOR stalked just off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out three wide leaving the half mile marker to advance
on the leaders, pressed the issue between foes on the far turn past midstretch but proved only second best. KING ANDRES was rated off the second flight
while angling inside to the backstretch, angled out four wide in upper stretch and continued with interest while just outkicked for second. BROADWAY
PETE, urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset, dueled for command inside foes into the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. A GIRLS
BESTFRIEND settled outside foes to the backstretch and passed between tiring rivals late. UNCLE PIP settled along the inside and never gained
contention. SIMMARDSTRIKE was urged forcing the pace outside a rival in the opening half, dueled between foes into the far turn and gave way into upper
stretch. UPPER CROWN tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, was fanned four wide into the lane and steadily faded. BARREL OF
STOUT broke slowly, settled last to the far turn, was fanned five wide into the stretch and proved no threat. ALLGORILLA tracked the leaders three deep in
second flight racing to the backstretch and retreated after a half.
