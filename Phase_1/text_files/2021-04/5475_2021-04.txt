Footnotes
BRUTUS , four deep in attendance of the pace heading to the seven eighths marker, dropped in a path and prompted outside foes past the five eighths,
emerged in a duel outside GLENGAR leaving the far turn, moved to a clear lead while under mild coaxing past the five sixteenths, responded when set
down past the three sixteenths and held firm. GLENGAR set a pressured pace towards the rail, dueled inside the winner from the far turn to about the five
sixteenths, saw that one get away a bit in upper stretch but battled back gamely to regain the place. CHARGING LION broke a step slow, edged up and
stalked three wide outside rivals, lost a bit of grounds leaving the far turn, came back three to four wide in upper stretch to have aim on the winner but
flattened out late. DASHING LOU prompted the pace between rivals early on, had the leaders get away past the half mile marker, chased around the final
turn but came up empty late. LECTRIC CHOKE saved ground, was hustled along into the far turn but failed to respond. IN HIM WITH HIM , with the pace
between runners into the first turn, steadied back off of foes soon after, was urged along into the far turn, dropped back a bit soon after, shifted out but failed
to generate a stretch kick. WHIRLIN CURLIN , reluctant to load, raced between runners early, dropped back after a half mile, swung five wide approaching
the stretch but had no rally.
