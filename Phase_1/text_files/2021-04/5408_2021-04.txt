Footnotes
SAUCY LADY T broke a beat slow when hesitant at the start and came under hustling coming out and bumping KANPAI, chased four wide through the turn
advancing on the front to confront LANDSLID five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch straightening away in the two path and seizing
command, drew clear under a drive and prevailed under vigorous hand urging to the finish. LANDSLID hustled from the gate, dueled three wide with
MIDSUMMER NIGHTS to her inside lightly coaxed along, began to shake off that rival when confronted by the top one at the five-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch under threat, yielded the front straightening away to the inside, chased the winner home clear of the rest and along second
best. MIDSUMMER NIGHTS hustled from the start, dueled from the two path with the aforementioned foe to her outside, got shaken off with five-sixteenths
to go, took the inside route into upper stretch and tipped out to the four or five path after straightening away for home and weakened. KANPAI broke a beat
slow at the start and was bumped after the start by SAUCY LADY T, chased three wide coaxed along at the tail of the field, swung four wide into upper
stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FIRST LINE was urged early to establish position then coaxed along just off the pace on the outside, pursued the leading duo in the four path on the turn,
spun five wide into the stretch, gained to make an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, fought outside of two foes under a drive into the final furlong, drifted in
some outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under strong urging. SHANGHAISCHOOL was hustled from the start, stalked the pace on the outside,
turned up the pressure in the three path on the turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, was roused nearing the quarter-pole then came under a drive in
upper stretch, fought on well in the final furlong but was outfinished while able to get the place. THERISASTORMBREWIN displayed good speed, showed
the way down the backstretch under some pressure to his outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was headed under some urging at the
five-sixteenths then roused for more approaching the quarter-pole, fought inside the top two under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back into the final
sixteenth and weakened but was clear for the show. ICY DUDE settled well behind the rest of the field under some urging, went four then five wide on the
turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. NOT THAT BRADY was sent hard from the start then coaxed along on the
inside, chased inside to the two path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. TRI SAINT LORENZO settled outside under some urging,
went three wide while ridden on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and faltered.

Footnotes
PATTY O'MARC was ridden along on the far outside, went six wide under strong encouragement on the turn, rallied outside nearing the quarter-pole, closed
strongly to make a bid in upper stretch, kicked clear into the final furlong and drew away under strong urging. NIGHT ESCORT made contact with a foe at
the start, settled under some urging, went four wide on the turn, gained under the crop into the stretch then made a bid near the three-sixteenths, lost touch
with the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while narrowly able to get the place. GO CASH GO came away in good order then was sent hard,
pressed the pace on the outside, vied outside of a foe in the four path on the turn, took the lead with three furlongs to run then moved clear at the
five-sixteenths, dropped to the three path shortly thereafter then turned into the stretch under urging, was challenged by two opponents around the
three-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner into the final furlong and also proved no match then just missed the place while clear for the show. LORENZEN
dropped back at the start, was urged along at the rear of the field, went four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. INTERSTATE was hustled from the start
then urged along towards the rear, angled in late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. THEITALIANAMERICAN was
ridden along off the pace, went five wide on the turn and failed to respond. BEING ME bumped with a rival at the start, established a good position down the
backstretch, was urged in the two path on the turn, dropped back nearing the quarter-pole and capitulated. UP FOR ADVENTURE veered in at the start and
was last to commence, rushed up to take the lead then set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the three path while inside of a foe on the turn,
lost the advantage at the three-eighths then dropped back fast and stopped.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT OBSESSION broke in and bumped with an opponent, settled in third position, dropped back under coaxing with six furlongs to run, came under
stronger encouragement before the five-eighths, went two then three wide on the turn, rallied four wide into the stretch under a left-handed crop, drifted out
approaching the furlong marker then was switched to a right-handed crop and closed well to get up in the final sixteenth under good handling. ICED LATTE
easily went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch with some company to her outside, vied in the two path under increased pressure on the turn,
was asked outside the five-sixteenths, came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, shook off TEETOTALER into the final furlong then switched to a
left-handed crop, drifted out while still in front into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while well clear for the place. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN broke out
and bumped with a foe, settled at the rear, went three wide under urging early on the turn, dropped to the two path around the five-sixteenths then the rail
shortly thereafter and lacked the needed response while up for the show. TEETOTALER was taken back early then moved out, stalked then pressed the
pace on the outside, vied in the three to four path on the turn, was asked late on that bend then turned into the stretch under the crop, dropped back into the
final furlong and weakened. DOLLAR MOUNTAIN was bumped on both sides at the start then steadied while pinched back, settled on the outside, was
urged along passing the five-eighths pole, went five wide on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
FUNNY BONES FLAG established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, shook away through the latter portion of
the turn, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, drew off in hand and was given the slightest urge just past the three-sixteenths opening up while under
wraps thereafter to prevail comfortably on the wire. MAKE OR BREAK hustled from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
continued three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. LOVE ME TOMORROW coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from
the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. AFLEETING GLANCE six
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. HEBAT away well from the gate, chased four
wide down the backstretch and through the turn, swung six wide for home, weakened while passing tired foes. MAGNIFICENT MAGS three wide in pursuit,
got coaxed along three furlongs from home, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. ROSIES SURPRISE just off the inside in pursuit and under
coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. HAPPYCREST five wide in pursuit under coaxing from midway on
the turn, tipped five to six wide at the head of the stretch, made no impact.
