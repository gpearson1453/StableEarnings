TOUGH LOVE tracked the pace early from the rail, was blocked nearing the lane to the three sixteenths pole, was altered out to the four path then
unleashed a rally, had a late surge three wide and nailed foe at the wire. HAUNT stalked the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane, drew clear of
the field from the eighth pole to the sixteenth pole but was nailed at the wire. WENT WEST chased the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane,
made a bid down the lane but did not have enough in the late stages. AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and
faltered late in the stretch run. LITTLE MENACE was bothered and put in tight early on, chased the pace, was in the five path into the lane and faded late in
the stretch drive. THE SOUND was a bit keen along the backstretch and through after a half.

Footnotes
CAUGHT LOOKING stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading trio turning for home, bid entering the lane, quickly drew away passing the three
sixteenths pole, and widened under hand urging through the final furlong. MAMA LOU stalked three wide, prompted the dueling leaders around the turn, bid
turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer bidding rival in upper stretch, and kept on well to prove second best. FORTUNA ADIUVAT set the pace
inside of BETHY, clung to an advantage from a trio of foes entering the lane, but proved no match for a pair of outer rivals in upper stretch, then held show
from BETHY to the wire. BETHY vied two wide, dueled between horses around the turn, but gave way to outer bidding foes in upper stretch, and got
outdueled for show. LA PULCINELA lied forwardly placed four wide, tracked from midpack in the three path around the turn, but failed to produce a bid.
RUN COOKIE RUN saved ground while off of the pace around the turn, but to no avail. DELTA TRAVELER tracked from midpack three wide and from
between horses early on, but got a bit keen among rivals at the five furlong pole, tracked from midpack in the two path around the turn, shifted to the four
path in midstretch while chasing, and failed to factor. SPY A STAR leaned inwards and bumped the gate when it opened, lied far off of the pace along the
inside, shifted to the six path in midstretch, and improved without threatening. FOREVER HOME took the turn in the three path while off of the pace, but
failed to factor. FROZAY ALL DAY tracked from midpack five wide, but weakened when shifting to the four path into the turn and was done early.
IMPRESSIVE ONE tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, but got shuffled back behind FROZAY ALL DAY into the turn, and was done early.
SWEET MISS PABLO was outrun and showed little.

KIND WAYS set the pace along the inside, shook clear of a pair of pressing foes into the far turn, and widened under driving pressure through the lane.
MEET THE BEAUTY pressed the pace two wide while staying in the three path around the first turn, vied between horses after LIPSTIKLIESNLOVERS
ranged up along side, but came under a drive at the half mile pole to keep pace with his inner counterpart, only produced a mild response to sustain chasing
position through the far turn, and proved second best. SUM KINDA PRETTY stalked along the inside, faded around the far turn, then regained stride in
upper stretch, and rallied for show through the final furlong. LIPSTIKLIESNLOVERS trailed early on, gained ground in the four path and outside of foes
around the first turn to prompt the pace into the backstretch, but tired around the far turn. ZAWADI was outrun.

HE'S IN CHARGE dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, inched clear of those foes in upper stretch, and held well from THE BIG KAHUNA to the wire.
THE BIG KAHUNA vied three wide, chased his inner most counterpart through upper stretch after that foe scooted clear, determinedly sustained his rebid
under a long drive to inch closer to that foe through the final furlong, but was denied. ONCOMING TRAIN lied off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the
three path in upper stretch, stayed on inside of READY TO ANSWER through the final furlong, and prevailed over that foe for show. READY TO ANSWER
tracked from midpack four wide, then stayed on giving a mild chase through the lane, and failed to threaten. ON YOUR MARK dueled for the lead two wide
and between horses, but failed to keep pace with those rivals in upper stretch. MY MAN FLINTSTONE stalked along the inside, chased through upper
stretch while aiming to split foes two wide at the furlong grounds, but lacked that kick, and faded. QUIXOTIC trailed in the four to three path around the turn,
and failed to factor.

Footnotes
AVERLY JANE stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the clear leader into the turn, ranged up to that foe while being floated to the four path entering
the lane, chased her under a long drive after shying mildly in midstretch, but reached that rival a sixteenth out, drew clear, and was wrapped up. VODKA N
WATER steadied behind AVERLY JANE when trying to achieve position in the opening furlong, settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three
path in upper stretch, and rallied through the final furlong to nail BOHEMIAN FROST on the wire for place. BOHEMIAN FROST cleared off early on,
managed a clear margin around the turn with AVERY JANE in pursuit, shifted to the three path entering the lane to meet that foe's bid, fended her off
through midstretch, but was headed a sixteenth out, flopped back to her left lead, weakened, and was nailed on the wire for place. SHESGOTATTITUDE
bobbled a bit at the start then got rank when altered outwards soon after, gained mildly from off of the pace in the three path around the turn, shifted to the
five path in upper stretch, but failed to menace. AMERICAN BOUND stalked two wide down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with the leader and an
inner rival into the turn, chased those rivals from the two path around the turn, but weakened along the inside through the lane. BAYTOWN FROSTY lied far
off of the pace along the inside, but got rank inside of a rival into the turn, saved ground around that bend, but to no avail. BODE BY YOU took the turn two
wide while trailing, and failed to factor. PER RULING FROM THE KENTUCKY RACING COMMISSION, AVERLY JANE WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR
POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
BEAR ALLEY cleared off early on, managed that clear lead while well in hand, was let out approaching the three sixteenths pole as a pair of rivals
attempted to range up alongside, but swiftly shrugged those rivals off at the furlong pole, and held well to the wire. BAMALAMA stalked the clear leader two
wide, came under a drive at the three furlong pole to inch closer, did so entering the lane and produced a mild bid, but was turned away at the furlong pole,
and proved second best. COOL RAGS tracked from midpack along the inside, advanced to a stalking position into the backstretch, tracked the leader
around the far turn before swinging three wide entering the lane to attempt a bid, but only managed to chase through upper stretch, flopped back to his left
lead at the furlong marker, weakened thereafter, but just saved show. SPHEROID lied far off of the pace along the inside, and improved through the lane to
just miss catching COOL RAGS for show. NIANGUA lagged well behind the field around both turns, and improved through the lane without factoring. BOLD
MINISTER saved ground from midpack, but faded around the turn. SOMETIMES ALWAYS lied forwardly placed three wide, but was done early.
