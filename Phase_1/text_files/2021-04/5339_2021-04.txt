Footnotes
HOT SOCKS pressed the early pace, continued to keep pressure on the pacesetter while two wide on the turn, collared DREAMER'S REALITY
approaching the eighth pole and was clear in the end. DREAMER'S REALITY assumed command of the early pace, saved ground through the turn, was
confronted by HOT SOCKS and could not hold off that foe but held to be second best. QUIPO chased the early pace while saving ground on the turn, was
asked for run into the drive and finished evenly in the stretch for third. PAPER BOY was off a step slowly, then was unhurried through the turn while two
wide, slipped onto the rail for the stretch run, and made a late rally on the fence to get fourth, though not challenging the top two. LUCK IS MY NAME settled
toward the back of the field early, saved ground through the turn while still toward the back, and could not mount a late rally in the stretch. SHARP
WARNING chased the early pace, was two wide on the turn while losing position, and weakened in the stretch drive. RUNAWAY KRISTIN chased the early
pace, lost position on the turn while three wide and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
COLD BREW KELLY was allowed to settle early, saved ground through the backstretch run, improved position on the second turn while saving ground,
angled out for the stretch drive and put in a bold late kick to prevail. NEW WAYS TO DREAM settled in the middle of the pack early, was three wide on the
first turn, continued to be wide through the backstretch, improved on the second turn while three wide, took the lead entering the stretch but was caught late
by COLD BREW KELLY while still second best. YOU'RE ALL TALK bobbled a bit at the start, then took command of the early fractions, continued to lead
while saving ground through the backstretch and second turn, was headed by NEW WAYS TO DREAM entering the stretch and tired to third late.
PRINCESS ALMA was unhurried early, continued to travel towards the rear through the backstretch, was two wide along the turn while improving position
and made a late rally in the stretch, though not challenging the top three late. IN THE WIND was three wide along the first turn, chased the early pace,
continued to be close while chasing the leaders through the backstretch, slipped to the rail while improving position along the second turn but could not go
on with that bid and weakened in the stretch. SHE'S EXPENSIVE chased the early pace, improved position on the backstretch, was outrun into the second
turn while two wide, lost position into the stretch and was empty late. CLARE'S IRISH EYES stalked the early pacesetter, continued to be close up during
the backstretch run, dropped back on the second turn while two wide and was outrun in the drive. LADY OF THE HOUSE went wrong soon after the start,
was pulled up and was vanned off.

and wore down DAMN THE TORPEDOES late. DAMN THE TORPEDOES The latter pressed the pace to the second turn, pushed up two wide to take over,
responded to mid stretch then could not hold off the winner but saved second. MOART hesitated and broke about four lengths last, trailed to the second turn
while four wide, was three wide into the stretch then closed with a rush but too late. KOKO'S MOM hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail for five
furlongs then was overtaken and gave way.

fractions, saved ground through the backstretch and run on second turn, shook off SHE'S A LIL FLIRT approaching the eighth pole, then dueled
RIGHTEOUSLY to the line but could not get past that foe for the win, while still a clear second. MADE IN KAROO was unhurried early, trailed through the
backstretch run, was still toward the rear on the second turn while five wide, and made a late rally in the stretch to get third. NORTHERN GEM was allowed
to settle toward the rear of the field, improved position along the backstretch and along the second turn while three wide, and made a mild late bid in the
stretch run. SHE'S A LIL FLIRT was four wide on the first turn, chased the leaders through the backstretch while improving position, pressured the leader
along the turn while two wide, was asked for run into the stretch, had to take up a bit nearing the eighth pole and tired in the stretch run.

second turn, was outrun off of the turn and had no late rally in the stretch. GRAZEN ROAD stalked the early pace from a ground saving position, lost

kicked clear late under left handed urging. RANGER MOLLY contested the early fractions by LA VIKINA, maintained a three wide running position through
the turn while keeping pressure on the pace, was confronted by CANAM GAL entering the stretch drive and could not fend that one off while holding for
second. LA VIKINA set early fractions from a two wide running position, was pressed through the turn, lost position entering the stretch and tired late,
though holding for third. JANERO ROSE settled in the midflight early, was three wide on the turn while chasing the contested pace, lost position into the
stretch and weakened late. KATE BOSS was bumped at the start by JANERO ROSE, settled in the midflight early, improved position along the turn while
saving ground,was outrun off of the turn and had no late rally. RED BETTE saved ground through the backstretch and run on the turn and was always
outrun.

A CARD SHORT stalked the early pace, was three wide along the turn while still close up, continued with a stretch bid, reeled in HOLY CATHOLIC then NIP
NAP and prevailed late. HOLY CATHOLIC stalked the early pace from NIP NAP, was two wide on the turn while applying pace pressure, was put under
right handed urging in the stretch, closed the margin on NIP NAP but could not hold off the winner. NIP NAP was hustled to set the early pace, saved
ground through the turn while being pressured, was tiring in deep stretch when passed by the winner and just missed for second. SILVER LYRIC was
unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, improved position into the stretch, and finished evenly. DIVALICIOUS settled toward the back of the field
early, was between horses three wide along the turn, and made a mild late bid in the stretch. AUTUMN ISABELLA settled in the middle of the pack early,
was two wide along the turn, was outrun off of the turn and was outfinished late. GREY ABBEY had no speed early, was four wide along the turn, gained
position into the stretch but could not continue that rally and finished evenly in the stretch. MIA SOLINA chased the early pace, lost position on the turn while
three wide, and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
NOWHERE MAN had no speed, raced in the rear while settling, came two wide to the stretch then shifted out for room, rallied once clear and closed
determinedly to prevail. THE BLACK ALBUM (FR) also had no speed, was asked three wide on the far turn, swung widest for the drive and closed fast and
grabbed second. FULL OF LUCK (CHI) tracked the pace from the rail to the second turn, pushed up to engage for the lead to mid stretch then stayed on
gamely late. COLOUR ME HAPPY (GB) pressed the pace early, edged up to duel outside of SMILEFORME two wide to the stretch, dug in willingly through
a long drive and just missed. RIVER ROSE was well place off the leaders for a half mile, bid three wide to join the leaders into the stretch, dueled gamely to
deep stretch then was bested. SMILEFORME was on the pace from the outset, saved ground to the stretch, dug in to deep stretch but weakened late.
FUENTE (GB) was also chasing the pace to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch, tried to rally between rivals in mid stretch but lacked room,
steadied hard and lost any chance. OF GOOD REPORT had no speed, trailed to the far turn, was three wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late
response.

Footnotes
SIZZLING INDIAN was sent for speed, set the pace in the two path to the stretch then responded determinedly and just held. PROOF OF PARANOIA was
chasing to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, eased out for the drive, made a strong run in the final sixteenth and just missed. MIDNIGHT JUDGE was
also hustled along early, pressed the winner inside to the stretch then briefly had room inside nearing the furlong marker, had that opening cut off, steadied
off heels to the sixteenth pole and was finished evenly. LUCKY CAUSE stalked the leaders to the turn, bid three wide to loom a threat to mid stretch, stayed
on to deep stretch then weakened. BUBBLES IS ON FIRE was outrun to the turn, raced four wide to the stretch and was gaining in the late stages. MAGIC
IS FLYING had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch and made a belated rally. CAPACITOR got outsprinted early, made a run three then four wide on
the turn to loom a threat into the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. WALKING WITH DINO hit the gate coming out, lost about four
lengths, trailed three wide and was not a threat. STARK MARK got outsprinted early, raced four wide into the turn, eased in to the stretch but also did not
rally.
