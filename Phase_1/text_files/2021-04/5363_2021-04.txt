Footnotes
SATURDAY SERVICE was within striking distance for a half then made a bid on the final turn from the three path and battled down the stretch but was able
to prevail late. E TICKET RIDE stalked the pace from the two path then lacked room to make a move on the turn so angled out at the head of the stretch to
challenge SATURDAY SERVICE but couldn't match strides with the winner. FAVORITE SISTER was unhurried early from the two path then made an
outside rally in the stretch drive to be up for show. MYSTERY STAR vied for the lead from the three path and weakened. GOSPEL JOSY JAN set the pace
for the first half from the inside and tired late. SWIFT JUSTICE trailed from the inside made a mild bid on the backstretch but gave way.

the two path then made a late rally but was unable to catch MACHOS VISION for the place. ZAPIT pressed the pace from the two path and started to
weaken on the turn. DAKAMO ROSE was within striking distance in the three path angled in slightly to make a bid on the turn and gave way at the head of

YOU'REOBADBOY set the pace from the inside drew clear while in hand and held sway. MONSTER RIVER was forwardly placed racing in the two path
and was able to gain on leader slightly in the final turn but was clearly second best. E Z TAPIT was allowed to settle on the inside but was no match for the
top two. MAKE MY YEAR had an awkward start then move to the inside after the first turn and improved position. SITUATENSHADY was well placed but
gave way after a half. WILD AND GOLDEN chased the leaders from the three path made a mild bid on the final turn then took a bad step at the head of the
stretch then was pulled up and vanned off.

MEGA BOND was well placed in the four path then made his bid on the turn and drew clear late in the stretch drive. BACKSTER BALL was unhurried early
then made a late rally from the three path in the stretch to be second best. WRANGLERED stalked the pace from the four path then lacked room on the turn
when making a mild bid but was able to hold on to show. SOLDADORES DOS set the early pace from the two path was headed after a half came again but
failed to sustain second bid. WINNERS LUCK led briefly from the inside then gave way. GO DRAG UP was forwardly placed from the two path and
weakened after a half. COACH DAN raced in the middle of the pack on the inside and failed to menace. ARTIC EXPRESS raced in the middle of the pack
and was never a factor. A FLICKER OFSILVER pressed the pace for a quarter then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
BARNACLE BOY shown reserve along the backstretch, awaited options entering the turn, tucked to inside near the quarter pole and rallied strongly along
the rail for the score. BEAR DEN was unhurried through the first call, angled out near the three sixteenths pole and had strong response to urging in the final
furlong for place honors. FROGGY stutter stepped and lost ground to the field shortly after start then earned the show with late flying strides in the
homestretch. TIME TO FIGHT rushed from outset to set the pace as the innermost rival of four abreast, maintained a two path stance through the bend and
led the field at upper stretch before being caught in final furlong. EL CHIHUAS rated amongst the pacesetters while trekking five wide at the conclusion of
backstretch, was well within striking distance at the top of the lane before failing to match strides with rivals in closing portion of contest. LOGAN MAN CAN
saved ground to no avail. RUBBER BANDMAN passed tiring foes after rating back through the opening half. GOSPEL JOHN rushed from outset to share
command along the backstretch, traveled three wide through the turn and had a strong bid at five sixteenths pole but eclipsed in crucial stages. OKLAHOMA
SWING flashed early speed and led the field between calls before fading rapidly in the homestretch.
