Footnotes
COLONELSDARKTEMPER vied for the lead outside of SOLOMONIC, dueled with that foe turning for home, forged an advantage approaching the furlong
pole, and drew clear thereafter. SOLOMONIC showed the way inside of COLONELSDARKTEMPER, dueled inside of that foe turning for home, but yielded
a furlong out, and held place to the wire. MISSISSIPPI was off a step slowly, trailed the field to the far turn, took that bend three wide, then stayed on for a
minor share. KADESH lied off of the pace along the inside, stalked the leading pair down the backstretch, but weakened around the far turn.
CHARLIE'SARCHANGEL stalked three wide, but faded down the backstretch and was done early.

POLISHED GEM set the pace inside of ROCK STAR PARKING, shook clear of that foe in upper stretch, and held sway under driving pressure. SUNNY
ISLE BEACH stalked from along the inside, shifted outside of that dueling leaders entering the lane, but ducked in at the three sixteenths pole due to the
rider asking for a lead change, straightened quickly afterwards to take aim, and stayed on to reach place at the wire. ROCK STAR PARKING vied outside of
POLISHED GEM, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, gave way, and was nailed on the wire for place. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME lied off of
the pace two wide and between horses, but faded around the turn. ARTIE'S ROSE lied off of the pace three wide, but came under an all out drive to sustain
chasing position turning for home, failed to respond, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MISTY VEIL vied inside of a pair of rivals around the first turn, cleared off from those foes down the backstretch, maintained a loose margin around the far
turn, met YOUENS's bid entering the lane, repelled that foe at the furlong grounds, and held sway thereafter. YOUENS tracked from midpack two wide,
advanced outside of foes into the far turn to be the closest pursuant to the clear leader, inched closer to bid entering the lane while staying a path from her
inner counterpart, but was repelled by that rival at the furlong grounds, and chased her home. VOLNAY trailed along the inside, shifted two wide inside the
three furlong pole to commence a gain, then chased from behind the leaders through the lane. WRINKLES YOUR NOSE resisted restraint crossing the wire
for the first time, settled in an inside stalking position around the first turn, but faded turning for home. SIMPLY BEGUILED lied off of the pace two wide, but
was shuffled back behind the stopping TONE MY BETTY into the far turn, shifted out four wide passing the three furlong pole, and failed to threaten
thereafter. TONE MY BETTY vied for the lead two wide and from between horses around the first turn, but wilted through the field into the far turn. ZEBRA
CAKE hopped a bit at the start, prompted the pace three wide, but was done into the far turn, then was eased up through the final furlong, and walked
across the wire before walking off.

KNOPFLER pressed the pace setter from the outside while being kept in the three path by that foe around the first turn, rated back to stalk outside of a pair
of foes into the far turn as the leader shook clear, produced a rerally in upper stretch to re-bid for the lead inside of COMMAND CENTRAL at the furlong
pole, and gamely fended off that rival to the wire. COMMAND CENTRAL tracked from midpack three to four wide, rallied in upper stretch to bid for the lead
outside of KNOFLER at the furlong pole, but was denied by that rival. AWESUMMER broke a bit outwardly , lied off of the pace two wide, split foes into the
far turn to achieve a stalking position between rivals, but was outkicked by outer foes approaching the furlong pole, and only managed to chase those foes
home. RUSHINGUY came in soon after the start, set the pace in the two path around the first turn, managed a clear margin around the far turn, but was
headed by a pair of foes passing the furlong pole, and gave way. CULTURE ICON saved ground off of the pace, swung five wide in upper stretch, but
lacked a kick to produce a bid. BOONE'S SPIRIT stalked along the inside, but got keen and tugged on the rider into the backstretch, stalked inside of
AWESUMMER around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with that foe entering the lane, remained minorly blocked behind that rival in upper stretch,
lacked a kick inside of that foe, then faded. BANE was always outrun.
