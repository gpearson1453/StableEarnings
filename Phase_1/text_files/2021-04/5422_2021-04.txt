Footnotes
BELLA SERENA broke readily, angled inwards dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, was prompted to widen the margin entering the turn and held
sway to the end under pressure. BOURN WILD AGAIN, in touch with the pacesetter between foes attending the pace, continued with a steady effort into the
stretch but proved only second best. CROSS THE MERSEY tracked just off the first flight between foes racing into the turn, and continued with interest to
gain some position along the inside. DAWNDETTI, urged to a forward placing three wide in early stages, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter in that path
into the turn and faded in the drive. LADY MIDAS, unhurried outside foes tracking just off the leaders in early stages, steadily faded racing into the turn.
AWESOME GAP, urged to contention along the inside, was going a bit erratically midway through the backstretch and quickly dropped out.

LIL ANNIE ROSE, urged inside rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage a bit off the rail racing into the turn, was headed leaving the midway point of
the bend but continued resolutely to turn back foes and go clear in late stages under firm left handed pressure. LALOBA FEROZ, roused to contend just
after the start, tracked just off the first flight in the opening stages, advanced three wide on the turn to press the issue nearing upper stretch, dueled outside
rivals past midstretch but came up second best. DEFENDANT, in touch with the pacesetter prompting that rival through the backstretch, dueled for
command between foes on the turn to upper stretch and weakened in the last furlong. AS IT SEEMS tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the
turn but faded early. SMOKING FOX was soon outpaced.

VOLADOR, raced three deep to the first turn gaining a contending position, then eased a bit off the leaders to track outside a rival to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance three wide on the far turn, moved to terms with the pacesetter in upper stretch while being floated out by that rival and continued with
a steady response to wrest the advantage and go clear under firm handling. PAYNTER FEST broke sharply, angled inwards dictating the pace to the
backstretch, held sway on a narrow margin to the far turn, resisted the winner's bid while shifting well off the inside racing into upper stretch but proved no
match late. BABIE MONSTER broke slowly, settled outside rivals to the backstretch, then continued with interest to improve position outside foes to late
stages. CROWN OF JOY tracked off the first flight a bit off the rail inside the eventual winner to the backstretch, then continued evenly into upper stretch.
LAPULGA tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch and offered no rally. HOLY DIVER switched out early while being briefly urged to
prompt the pacesetter into the backstretch and gave way on the far turn.

LOGSDON angled inwards gaining a forward placing just after the start, was rated dropping off the first flight on the backstretch, shifted out entering the
turn, steadily gained on the leaders three wide between foes racing into upper stretch and edged forward in time to prevail under strong handling.
OUTSTANDING DEBT broke outwards bumping MR. EDGAR while breaking last, settled outside foes in early stages, advanced to contention four wide
through the turn, loomed outside foes in that path nearing midstretch but was just outkicked. CHINOMADITO, held up avoiding tight quarters along the
inside in early stages, dropped out last racing to the turn, angled to the six path entering the lane and continued with some interest to prevail for a share.
MR. EDGAR, bumped at the start, was quickly righted, then angled to the inside disputing the pace inside rivals through the backstretch into the turn,
continued to press the issue into upper stretch but weakened late. MIKADO, in touch with the first flight three deep prompting the pace, pressed the issue on
the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum. SAVAGE MUSIC, urged between foes pressing
the pace, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
ROUGH NIGHT, angled to the rail in the opening stages prompting a rival's pace to the backstretch, dueled for command into the far turn, edged forward
nearing upper stretch, ducked inwards nearing the furlong marker, was immediately corrected under left handed pressure and went clear under firm
handling. KING LEONARDO was rated stalking just off the first flight while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, came through inside the pacesetter
to challenge for command nearing midstretch, was steadied when momentarily caught in close quarters racing past the furlong marker, then came under
pressure to close the gap but couldn't gain terms with the winner. NEW JERSEY JOHN broke readily, forced the pace outside a rival racing to the
backstretch, dueled for command with that foe to upper stretch and weakened in the drive. MISSION DRIVEN, off slowly, then bumped at the start, settled
outside a rival to the backstretch, angled inwards on the far turn and improved position inside rivals late. GO HIPPO GO tracked off the second flight along
the inside, angled out four wide racing into the stretch but offered no rally. IRISH MAJOR broke in bumping MISSION DRIVEN, was righted to track the
leaders outside a rival in the second flight racing to the far turn but gave way into upper stretch. TAPSOLUTE dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE
THE RIDER OF KING LEONARDO LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST ROUGH NIGHT ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH WHILE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED ROUGH NIGHT
FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM SECOND..

Footnotes
THEUNCAPTUREDLADY broke readily, dictated the pace along the inside to the backstretch, turned back a rival's challenge to regain a clear advantage
racing into upper stretch and maintained that advantage under pressure. DR KAAK tracked off the second flight under rating in the opening half, then
steadily gained position between foes racing into the lane to prove best of the others. AGELESS ARTIST tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight
to the backstretch, shifted three wide after a half while being prompted to advance, moved to press the issue outside the eventual winner on the far turn,
dueled into upper stretch, then drifted out racing through the lane while giving way. PRINCESS KYLISE settled last near the inside racing to the first turn,
angled out racing into upper stretch and made some belated progress. WHISTLER DIXIE, forwardly placed prompting the pacesetter to the backstretch,
gave way after a half. MARIMBA tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and faded in late stages.
JASIRA angled to the inside early while dropping well off the leaders, ducked out entering the backstretch and quickly dropped out. SUMMER SPIRIT,
caught a bit wide racing to the first turn, was held up momentarily avoiding JASIRA racing into the backstretch and quickly dropped out.

RUBY LEE angled inwards while being rated off the first flight in the opening stages, shifted out four wide entering the turn steadily gathering momentum,
moved to challenge for command midstretch and went clear late under firm encouragement. THAT IS KEY, off slowly, was settled last to the turn, angled
outside foes to race in the five path entering upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail narrowly for the place honors at the wire. DON'T EATTHE
APPLE vied for command four wide through the backstretch, shook clear nearing the turn while angling inwards, set the pace into upper stretch and gave
way once headed by the winner. PASSIONFORTREASURE, urged between foes prompting the pace, was held up avoiding close quarters nearing then
turn, then continued to gain some position while angling to the inside racing into the lane. J'S SILKY, urged prompting the pace three wide between foes in
the opening stages, continued in pursuit of the leaders into upper stretch and gave way. LA WAPA tracked off the first flight five wide, then four wide racing
into the turn while making brief progress but flattened out entering the lane. DREAMS STILL WILD, urged inside rivals prompting the pace in the opening
stages, dropped out early. SMOOTH AS GLASS, caught six wide tracking off the first flight racing through the backstretch, gave way early.

INDEPENDENCE LAW broke readily, sped clear while angling to the rail, held sway on a comfortable margin into the lane and was kept to firm
encouragement. HAPPY THOUGHT tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the leader
entering upper stretch, couldn't gain terms with that foe but held grudgingly for the place honors. THREE COINS tracked off the second flight while angling
to the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and made some late progress nearest the rail while just outkicked for second. FARCICAL reserved while
angling inside early, switched outside rivals after a half, made brief progress to advance four wide nearing upper stretch but faded in the drive. REALLY
LIKE LAURA settled outside foes to the backstretch and never gained contention. BROOKSIDE BELLE tracked the leaders along the inside and faded from
contention early. HEY HOTTIE, urged to forward placing along the inside, emptied out racing through the far turn. RENEESINHEAVEN ducked at the start
dislodging her rider, but walked off the course under her own power after being collected by the outrider.

match the winner late. SNAP HOOK gained a forward placing while angling to the inside to track off the first flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out three
wide entering the lane and continued willingly between foes to prevail for a share. THE CURT FOX (GB) settled near the inside racing to the backstretch,
was prompted to advance between foes on the far turn, was fanned four wide in upper stretch and continued with a mild bid. JOY CITY broke inwards
