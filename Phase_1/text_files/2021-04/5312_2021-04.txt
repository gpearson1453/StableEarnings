Footnotes
FLIPPING FISH pressed EL ZOPILOTE from outside, reached the front between that one and CONSTITUENCY after a half-mile, shook clear and moved
inside through upper stretch and held under a drive. FIRST RULE brushed the left side of the gate coming out, then bumped twice with NAHUATL soon
after, waited behind the leaders in the two-path a quarter-mile out, got bumped by CAMP PENDLETON at the top of the stretch, moved further out and
finished well. CONSTITUENCY ranged up three wide to loom a threat outside the leaders after a half, got shaken off by the winner turning for home and
was outfinished for second. CAMP PENDLETON was boxed in along the rail on the turn, clipped the heels of EL ZOPILOTE and stumbled sharply bumping
into FIRST RULE, had the rider recover through upper stretch and regrouped to finish with good courage all things considered. DR. ROGER was under a
drive three wide before going a half, and made no late headway on the far outside. EL ZOPILOTE set the pace near the inside, got clipped behind by CAMP
PENDLETON outside the three-sixteenths, and gave way steadily. NAHUATL bumped twice with FIRST RULE just after the start, and was outrun
throughout. INVISIBLE GHOST broke slowly and was always far back. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE TOP OF THE
STRETCH BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

LAKI LIO sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace just off the rail and held well clear under a drive. MERLIN chased the winner two wide, never
threatened that foe but dug in inside KITODAN to hold second. KITODAN raced three wide in midpack and had a mild gain while held off the place. RAYO
chased the pace inside and faded through the lane. WOW TAPIT failed to menace while racing four wide. BROADWAY BELLE was outrun while racing
three wide. NOBLE PRESENT was outrun inside.

Footnotes
LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN was unhurried early, waited behind the front flight in the three-path going by the quarter-pole, tipped widest in upper stretch and
kicked in to run past the leaders and draw clear. JOSEFA set an even pace inside to the far turn, came into the stretch in the two-path and stayed on well.
AIZU moved in early, saved ground in range to the stretch, then had little maneuvering room on the fence inside JOSEFA through the last sixteenth of a mile
and could not be set down. DADDY'S JOY bumped with FIERCE SCARLETT at the start, raced four then three wide around the first turn, remained out in
the course taking closer order after a half-mile, but lacked a solid closing response. GHOSTLY BEAUTY saved ground early, moved out three then four
wide on the far turn, and could not threaten with an even finish. COPPER prompted the pace outside, came under a ride between horses approaching the
quarter-pole, and did not have enough through the lane. FIERCE SCARLETT bumped with DADDY'S JOY at the start, and was outrun inside. AN
OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF AIZU AGAINST JOSEFA FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

RUNNING MEMORIES was off a bit slow, had speed inside, angled out to stalk the pace in the clear three wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole, moved to
the front near the eighth pole and drew off under a drive. HEADLINE HUNTER was off the pace inside, steadied entering the turn, angled three wide soon
after, swung widest nearing the lane and finished well to gain the place in the final strides. EXACT was soundly bumped at the start but still away quickly,
dueled two wide to midstretch, was no match for the winner from there and lost second late. THIRD TIME AROUND dueled along the rail to the eight pole
and weakened. DONTPUSHYOURLUCK was not a threat while racing two wide. SUNSHINE CITY broke out and bumped EXACT at the start, raced three
wide and played no further factor. IMAGERY failed to menace while racing two and three wide. BOURMA was outrun inside.

Footnotes
ONE EYED JACK was forwardly placed from the outset, loomed three wide after six furlongs, got brushed by PROSPECT PROJECT once straightened
away for the drive, battled between the latter and EXCALIBUR and proved best late. EXCALIBUR tracked from close range outside, bid four wide into the
lane, reached a short lead outside rivals through the furlong grounds but was edged to the wire. PROSPECT PROJECT slipped through on the rail with a
bid leaving the turn, came out brushing ONE EYED JACK into the stretch, and yielded late inside the top two. HARPER GO LUCKY raced three then four
wide around the turn, and finished evenly outside. ALASTOR set the pace near the inside for six furlongs, and was overhauled from both sides turning for
home. POINT WINNER was a step slow to begin, and failed to reach contention inside. GIMMEABREAK became unruly tossing his head around leaving the
gate, and was outrun three wide. RACK GIN was never prominent. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE TRAINER OF EXCALIBUR FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS QUICKLY DISMISSED.

OMAHA CITY bobbled at the start, was off the pace three wide around the turn, closed determinedly outside and was up in deep stretch. DR. DUKE set the
pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and led until the final strides. U. S. STEEL bumped with NO QUE NO not long after the start, saved ground
in range and finished willingly inside. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) broke in a tangle, raced three wide and had a mild belated rally. NO QUE NO was bumped
between foes not long after the start, hit the rail entering the turn, angled four wide soon after and never threatened. NACO pressed the pace two wide, bid
nearing the quarter pole but faded in the lane. DASSULT MIRAGE was soundly bumped not long after the start, steadied entering the turn, saved ground
and lacked a rally.

C'MON KAREN advanced outside rivals after a half-mile, drew a bead on BRIELLA through upper stretch, and reeled in that rival with a sixteenth to go
while drifting out steadily. BRIELLA bumped with PULLING STRINGS at the start, hustled clear along the rail through sharp early fractions, grew leg weary
past the eighth-pole and could not contain the winner, but ran on clearly second best. PULLING STRINGS bumped with BRIELLA at the start, pursued the
latter from outside while well ahead of the others, then gave way past the quarter-pole while moving inside. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL raced three to four wide,
and never factored. THE BIGGEST ONE gave chase two to three wide early, and tired. THINK IT THRU showed little trailing throughout.

Footnotes
TIL THE END settled off the pace while racing two and three wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, closed outside, came in a bit under steady
right-handed urging leaving the sixteenth pole and was up in deep stretch. KROY stalked the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole and led
to deep stretch. DOMINATE THEMOMENT saved ground in range, angled two wide nearing the lane, made some progress then checked when in tight late.
FREEDOM MATTERS had some speed three wide, rated back down the backstretch, continued three wide around the far turn, bid between foes nearing
the eighth pole then checked when in tight in deep stretch. ZERO GRAVITY saved ground off the pace, swung out near the eighth pole and never
threatened. TREASURE RUN set the pace along the rail and retreated nearing the lane. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION
FROM THE RIDER OF FREEDOM MATTERS, TIL THE END WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE
STRETCH. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED AND FRACTIONS WERE UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
MUMBAI chased outside WHAT A TRICK from the start, moved to the three-path leaving the turn, stayed on task and forged past through deep stretch
under a drive. WHAT A TRICK bumped with ELUSIVE UNCAPTURED at the start, sped clear inside, came off the turn in the two-path, dug in when
challenged by MUMBAI, and yielded grudgingly. BREEHAZEL banged into the right side of the gate at the start, chased two to three wide, could not keep up
with the leaders into the stretch and ran on best of the remainder. THAT'S MY BABY brushed with WISE MEMORIES at the start, checked behind ELUSIVE
UNCAPTURED a few strides later, and raced evenly unable to reach contention. MADEIRA WINE was outsprinted three wide to the stretch, and made no
progress on the far outside. ELUSIVE UNCAPTURED bumped with WHAT A TRICK at the start, and faded through the stretch inside. WISE MEMORIES
broke inward, and trailed near the inside.
