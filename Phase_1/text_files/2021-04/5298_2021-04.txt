Footnotes
CRYPTO CASH dropped towards the rear of the field early, went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the back while unhurried, was roused in the
two path on the far turn, swung out into upper stretch then drifted a bit further out before being straightened by the rider, rallied outside under a left-handed
crop and closed strongly to win going away. THE LAST ZIP was asked leaving the gate then taken in hand early, saved ground on the first turn, was rated
just off the pace, came under urging leaving the backstretch, went around the far turn in the two path, shifted four wide into the stretch, made a bid outside
of two foes under a drive, gained a brief lead outside the sixteenth-pole but was overtaken while able to get the place. LARCENY broke very fast and went
straight to the front then was taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the four path, contested the pace on the outside, vied two to three wide on the far
turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked while clear for the show. RHYTHM SECTION broke
out and hit the gate, went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved under a tight hold, saved ground while asked on the far turn, was put to a drive
in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. NINJA DUST was taken in hand early, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, rounded
the far turn in the two path, swung four wide into the stretch then was carried further out and failed to rally. YOU ARE AWESOME contested the pace
towards the inside, came under a drive in upper stretch, battled into the final furlong and weakened. KID CHOCOLATE went three wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch then dropped back into the far turn, went four then five wide on that bend, moved out in
upper stretch and failed to respond. ORAZIO was asked leaving the gate then taken in hand early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was rated
just off the pace, came up empty while three to four wide on the far turn and faltered. ARITHMETIC dropped well behind early, saved ground on the first
turn, lagged at the rear under urging, went around the far turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor.

WAR TERMINATOR bumped at the start by THUNDERBIRD CAFE due to pressure from MR. BUCKLEY breaking inwards, chased just off the inside until
tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, began to tip out near the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying through
the final furlong to overthrow a duel seventy yards from home taking command at that juncture, then prevailed going away at the end. SHERIFF BIANCO
got bumped at the start by MR.BUCKLEY and in turn bumped THUNDERBIRD CAFE into WAR TERMINATOR, vied from the two path inside a pair before
tucking inside through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in dueling through the stretch and was collared seventy yards from home in
tandem with his main pace rival, then bested that foe for the place honors. KING ANGELO brushed at the start by SCHERZANDO, who broke outwards,
vied four then three wide with a pair coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dueled through the stretch to the finish
getting collared by the top one in concert with his main pace foe, then got bested for the place honors. THUNDERBIRD CAFE pinched at the start,
conceded four lengths to the front, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and
improved position, then made no late headway. NOBLE CONQUEST brushed at the start, chased five to six paths off the inside until tucked to the two path
into the turn, swung three wide for home and passed tired foes. SCHERZANDO broke out at the start, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. MR. BUCKLEY broke in at the start bumping SHERIFF BIANCO, came under coaxing and vied
three then two wide between foes under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. NAPOLEON COMPLEX five to six
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home

Footnotes
BRATTLE HOUSE moved out in the early going then dropped back in around the three-quarter pole, settled in third position, ranged up while shifting from
the two path to the four path on the turn, made a bid with three furlongs to run, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole, drew away under a drive into the final
sixteenth then was eased up late while much the best. PENDOLINO moved out nearing the three-quarter pole, settled in second position, chased four to five
wide on the turn and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. PLEASURE LUCK settled off the pace, went four wide under urging on the
turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and narrowly missed the place while clear for the show. CHEATHAM HILL raced well back in the field, passed the
nine-sixteenths in hand, went three wide while roused on the turn and lacked the needed response. MABEL ISLAND showed good speed and set the pace,
vied two to three wide on the turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and tired. FAIR LASSIE was urged along at the rear, went five on the turn and failed
to respond. LA KARA MIA broke out at the start, settled on the outside, dropped back five wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BETSY BLUE four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch, dug in under an off sided stick and was
directed inwards a furlong out to get a good look at the leader CHEROKEE SONG, dug in under a drive steadily whittling away at that rival to just get up on
the wire. CHEROKEE SONG coaxed from the gate, dueled two then three wide with PRINCESS PINKY to her outside, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch shaking off that rival, dug in under a drive under growing threat to the outside clinging stubbornly to the
lead until nailed in the very last jump to the finish. PRINCESS PINKY dueled three then four wide with the aforementioned foe to her inside, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away and weakened. POSITIVE POWER chased two to three
wide under a ride from three furlongs out, spun three wide for home and trailed.

Footnotes
CHOOSE HAPPINESS broke out and bumped lightly with a foe, settled comfortably off the pace, saved ground in dead aim of the leaders on the turn,
moved out under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, rallied into the final furlong and closed well to get up in the final sixteenth under good handling. LOVE
ME TOMORROW displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside of a foe in the two path on the turn, shook clear into upper
stretch then came under the crop, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. MISTY TASTE broke out at the start,
settled just off the pace on the outside, chased five wide on the turn while put to the crop, was driven hard into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick
while able to get the show. MAKE OR BREAK broke awkwardly then bumped with a foe, settled on the far outside, dropped back while urged six wide on
the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop and failed to rally. BEYOND BROWN bumped with a rival at the start, stalked the pace on the outside,
turned up the pressure on the leader late on the backstretch, vied in the four path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened. WEAR MY
RING bumped lightly with foes on both sides at the start, was well spotted just off the pace, passed the nine-sixteenths under urging, went three wide on the
turn then came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. GAGLIANO bumped lightly with a rival at the start then dropped back quickly,
was urged along at the rear, went three wide on the turn and was no factor.

leader before advancing through the turn on that rival in concert with SECRET LOVE, took over narrow command spinning three wide into upper stretch,
inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held sway to prevail. SECRET LOVE broke in at the start brushing MY ROXY GIRL and was
corrected, chased five then four wide advancing on the front midway on the turn, swung five wide for home and offered up a mild kick to chase the winner
home securing the place honors on the wire. SINGULAR SENSATION seven to eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile
from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and ran on to procure the show honors. FOREVER

through the turn and came under threat from a pair midway on the turn, yielded the front at the quarter pole and went four wide for home, then weakened in
the stretch. WAILIN JOSIE got bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then
three wide through the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. FIGHT ON LUCY seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, chased
five wide through the turn and into upper stretch under coaxing from the three-eighths and made no impact. DUBLINORNOTHIN broke out at the start

Footnotes
VELVET CRUSH went to the front then moved clear early, was well rated while setting the pace well off the inside, controlled the tempo in the three path on
the turn, responded well when set down into upper stretch, was given two cracks of a right-handed crop approaching the furlong marker, switched to a
left-handed crop then was given one crack nearing the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best while placed under a brisk hand ride to the wire. STAND
FOR THE FLAG settled comfortably off the pace, was roused while inside on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop, moved out behind the leader
inside the furlong marker and proved no match while well clear for second. MAIDEN BEAUTY moved out entering the main track, tracked the pace on the
outside, was asked in the four path on the turn, chased under a drive into the stretch and tired. MY SWEET WIFE angled out sharply in the early going,
settled at the rear, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went five then four wide on the turn and faltered.

went clear under a drive kept to task. SHAMALAMADINGDONG five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to kick on belatedly for the place honors. WRITE
THIS DOWN chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch, improved position to secure the show
honors a furlong out and kept on one paced to the finish. KREESA LA WROTE four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. HANDLE THE TRUTH chased three

SOCIAL WHIRL five to six paths off the inside forwardly placed down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, faded through the turn and went four wide for home, then tired in the stretch. FASTELLE seven paths off the inside in aim of the leader down
the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and gave way. SPUN
