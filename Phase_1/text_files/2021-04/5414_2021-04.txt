Footnotes
MORO TRUMP was well rated early, came into the stretch three wide, then closed well under left handed encouragement to get up late to prove best.
TENACIOUS LION was sent to the front to set the pace from the inside, was still clear leaving the furlong marker, but had nothing left late and was caught in
deep stretch while saving the place. IMPERIAL FLYER stalked the pace three wide but lacked the needed winning bid while besting the rest. PRINCE
PERFECT had no rally while saving ground. AUTHENTIC ARCH chased the early pace three wide then stopped.

Footnotes
CYPRESS POINT was away alertly and crossed over to the rail to set the pace, then drew off to prove much the best under mild left handed urging. FOR
REEF'S SAKE stalked the early pace and made a three wide on the turn but proved to be no match for the winner while second best. SUGARLICIOUS
chased the early pace three wide, angled out five wide in the stretch to be up for the show award. ENJAY'S BRASS chased the pace on the inside but
lacked the needed rally while saving ground throughout. GRILLIN raced evenly. DELICIOUS PURSUIT checked after the start, failed to menace.
SHACKLELACKALACKA was allowed to settle early, was four wide past the quarter pole while not being a threat.

DIEM NOW stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide entering the stretch, drew clear in the final furlong to prove best, driving. LINDA GOT
LUCKY was reserved early, made a five wide move on the far turn, continued that bid in the stretch but hung late. HOPPING JITTERBUG was well placed
early on the inside, then was boxed past the quarter pole, lacked room in upper stretch, angled out past the eighth pole for racing room, rallied. REPO GIRL
dueled for the early lead three wide, made a bid on the turn but was empty late. OH MY OH was void of early speed, then advanced on the inside on the
turn, then had a belated rally towards the inside. IAMINTERESTING was allowed to settle early, then was six wide past the quarter pole, found best stride
late to offer a mild late rally. RUN ON GIRL dueled for the early lead on the inside then weakened. STONE TOP was off slow, then hustled four wide then
tired. FAITH AND FIRE was allowed to settle, then was on the inside by the quarter pole, weakened. ROBYNS LUCKYLIZARD was through early.

Footnotes
STILLCHARGINGMARIA was restless in the gate, came away in good order, opened clear to dictate terms, was collared into the second turn, turned back
the bid of FLOWERS FOR K K entering the stretch, shook away to score with something left. The latter shadowed the leader three deep, took aim at that on
midway through the second turn, was unable to go on with STILLCHARGINGMARIA but toiled on to preserve the runner up spot. MARLOW settled in hand,
looped into the stretch four wide and continued on fairly well through the lane. XYLOPHONE broke a step slow, was allowed to settled while saving ground,
shifted out a bit into the stretch and finished with a belated improvement. INDY LOVER was close up off of the inside for six furlongs and caved. BAD GAL
RIRI was slow into stride and was never a factor. JIMENA saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
ROCKO'S WHEEL set the pace from the inside, was well handled on the front end, repelled the bid of TIZ SHOWBIZ past the five sixteenths pole to shake
clear when straightened for the drive, then kept that rival safe to prove best in a game score. TIZ SHOWBIZ stalked the winner throughout, tried that rival
three wide on the second turn but could not get past that rival while staying on for the place. DEANOS CAPE tracked the pace from the inside down the
backstretch, eased out and came three wide into the stretch, offered a mild late rally but needed more. CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT was allowed to settle early,
came four wide into the stretch to have a late rally. CAMPS BAY was reserved early, came into the stretch while saving ground to offer a belated rally down
on the inside. SWEEPING EDGE was allowed to settle while four wide then tired on the far turn. POMPEYANO failed to menace. ARMCHAIR JOCKEY was
not a factor.

Footnotes
BOBBY BRINKLEY was sent to the front and crossed over to the rail entering the first turn, was uncontested on the front end on the backstretch, then was
headed past the quarter pole, responded well when roused to draw clear past the eighth pole, then remained clear to prove best. AKTULGALI was four wide
on the first turn, went up to stalk the pace three wide down the backstretch, made a four wide bid on the far turn to vie with the winner, but could not go with
that rival in the lane while saving the place. FIRST AVENUE was reserved early, advanced nicely along the rail on the far turn, angled out in the stretch for
racing room but hung late. PIRATE JUNCTION stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the far turn to vie for command, then was in between
rivals past the eighth pole but was empty late. BLING'S BELLWETHER chased the early pace then weakened. FLAT OUT AVENGER failed to menace.
GAMMA RAY showed little. The stewards posted the Inquiry sign concerning the running in the stretch, but after reviewing the replays they deemed to be no
change.

RAGING GOLD DIGGER was away alertly to set the pace while moving to the rail, was well handled on the front end, responded well when sent down
entering the stretch, then held on late to prove best under a drive. MARTZ'S MAE reserved early, came five wide into the stretch, closed with a rush to just
miss. NO MAS TEQUILA was four wide into the first turn, rated along while still four wide down the backstretch, made a four wide move leaving the far turn,
but hung late. BELIEVE IN BEAUTY (IRE) was rated along while in between rivals, angled in past the three sixteenths pole for racing room, but failed to
gain. LEA'S PRINCESS was well placed on the inside, was boxed on the second turn, but lacked the needed winning bid once clear. HAPPY SONRISA was
allowed to settle early, had to circle six wide past the quarter pole for racing room but lacked a serious rally. SHIRLEY'S TEMPLE was rated along and
made a four wide bid but was empty in the final furlong. FASTED stalked the pace three wide then tired. Fraction times were unavailable for this race.
