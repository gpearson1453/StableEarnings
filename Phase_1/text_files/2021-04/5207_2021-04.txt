Footnotes
CORVETTE SPIRIT unhurried in the early part, made a steady gain, moved up outside around the final turn, made a late bid, seven wide and drove clear
before the wire. RAMAAH lacked early speed, moved up on the inside around the second turn, angled out entering the stretch, split rivals and finished
willingly. QUANA DUDE raced near the back in the beginning, made a late rally and was outfinished for second. OPTIMISTIC vied for the early lead, drove
clear and weakened down the home stretch. VELVET RIDGE challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed until late, lacked a finished and faded down the
home stretch. WAR PLAYER raced within contention, made a bid, weakened and finished evenly. PRINCE LOKI raced within striking distance, dropped
back and was no threat late. SAILING JETT was an early factor, raced wide around the first turn and retreated. AND YET ANOTHER void of early speed
and trailed throughout.

gained ground, finished wide and was outfinished for second. QUEEN BINDALA broke out, bumped rival, dueled for the early lead, saved ground and hung
down the stretch. QUEEN SHASTA vied for the early lead and faded down the home stretch. AREYOUINABAND broke in, bumped rival, flashed early
speed, saved ground and was finished early. ROSE RUNNER raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. FLASH COPY void of early speed,

Footnotes
MOSTLY AWESOME stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up around the final turn on the outside, made a rally, four wide, drove clear and won
under steady urging. STAR GAZE bobbled at the start, raced near the middle of the field, made a bid, drove clear, proved no match for the winner late, but
was a clear second. NANA'S JOY lacked early speed, made a late gain, proved no match for the top two, but got by LIL ALLIE DANCER for the show
position. LIL ALLIE DANCER pressed the pace, had an outside trip and was caught for third. BELLA MOON showed early speed and weakened late.
AMELIA MADELYN lacked early speed, raced wide around the second turn and was never a factor. A J'S GRAND raced within contention, faded and was
no threat late. AUBREY reared at the start and was never close. GRACE OF DAVID went to the front, saved ground and dropped back.

SOCIAL GALAXY dueled for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drove clear and was kept to the task. AUDACIOUS GIRL raced within contention,
came around the turn wide, rallied and got up for second. MY HONEY'S MONEY was fractious in the gates, bumped at the start, raced near the back,

around the final turn, gained ground down the home stretch, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. CHAOSMOS pressed the early pace,
saved ground around the second turn and weakened. LIP SERVICE void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. TWO MIKES N DOC G
lacked early speed and passed tired ones. LUCKY INFERNO raced near the middle of the field, came around the final turn on the outside and faded.
