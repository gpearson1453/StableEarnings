Footnotes
GOTTA GO MO showed good speed then moved clear coming to the nine-sixteenths, was challenged late on the backstretch, vied inside of a foe while in
the two path on the turn, was asked while being headed at the quarter-pole, responded well then quickly regained the advantage, disposed of VIOLENT
POINT outside the sixteenth-pole and held off the runner-up under strong urging. SILKY BLUE settled comfortably off the pace, was roused in the three path
on the turn, chased under the crop in the stretch, gained some on the winner late and finished willingly for the place. SCREAMIN' BY settled on the outside,
moved in with a half-mile to run, saved ground on the turn, moved out under the crop in upper stretch and improved position to just get the show.
DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was urged three to four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive and just missed the show. VIOLENT POINT showed speed on the inside of the winner then was eased back, switched out outside the
half-mile pole then moved up to press the pace, vied in the three path on the turn, took a narrow and brief lead at the quarter-pole then lost the advantage
back to the winner, battled with that foe under a drive into the final furlong and weakened then lost the superfecta. VIP NATION leaned out at the break and
was last away, angled in at the rear of the field, went around the turn in the two path, turned into the stretch under the crop and failed to threaten. DOLL
settled off the pace, was given her cue while inside on the turn, came under the crop in upper stretch and lacked the needed response.

even terms, then ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. ROSEY'S PEACH chased just off the inside under coaxing from
the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. TAP THE BARREL chased just off the inside under

Footnotes
OUR LITTLE JEWEL was taken in hand early, set a slow pace in tandem with a rival while outside in the three path, shook clear outside the quarter-pole,
responded well when set down in upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop into the final furlong then was switched to a right-handed crop, drifted in
late and maintained a safe advantage under steady urging. POSITIVE SKEW broke out and bumped with a foe, was taken under a tight hold early, saved
ground on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear despite the slow pace, saved ground while let out on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch
then was put to a drive, dropped in some near the furlong marker and finished willingly for the place. JEN'S BATTLE was taken in hand early, settled in the
two path, was roused four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. SKY KITTEN bumped with a rival at the start, became
keen when taken under a vigorous hold early, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved under tight restraint, went three wide while let out on the far
turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MICROMILLION went to the front while placed under a vigorous hold, had the saddle
slip forward under a very strong hold as the rider put his feet in the dashboard, saw the saddle continue to slip forward while inside on the first turn, set the
pace in tandem with the winner while difficult to control along the rail, dropped back late on the far turn and gave way. PATRONA went around the first turn
in the two path, settled at the rear, raced three wide on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, floated seven wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten.

Footnotes
SANCTUARY CITY got bumped between foes and pinched back at the start conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased
along the inside from the tail of the field early on, tipped two then three wide through the turn placed to coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, angled out six
wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command just outside the sixteenth pole, then edged clear to the finish to
prevail. DISCRETIONARY MARQ three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung two to three wide
for home, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in under threat and was collared near the sixteenth marker, ran on to preserve the place honors. BIG
PACKAGE broke out a step at the start and was corrected, chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick. GHOST GIANT broke out at the start bumping SANCTUARY CITY in concert with ON THE COUCH, who broke inwards
and pinched that rival back between them, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. VALMONT fractious in the gate prior to the start, got away well and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under
pressure near the quarter pole, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and relented a furlong from home, then weakened
in the late going. ON THE COUCH broke in at the start bumping and pinching back SANCTUARY CITY in tandem with GHOST GIANT and was bumped
herself from the pressure inside coming from GHOST GIANT, chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, went two to three wide for
home and weakened. QIAN B C three to four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ALTAF settled towards the rear of the field, tucked into the two path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, shifted four wide outside the
quarter-pole, rallied into upper stretch, closed well under a hand ride to get the lead inside the furlong marker then moved clear late under measured
handling to prevail. LOVE AND LOVE was away alertly then switched to the outside early, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the
three path on the turn, took lead at the quarter-pole, was put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop into the final furlong, lost
the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole then went back to a right-handed crop and was outfinished but well clear for the place. FIRENZE
FREEDOM settled at the rear of the field, was urged along midway down the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn, dropped in under the crop
into upper stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. RISK MODEL was hustled to the front, showed the way down the
backstretch, vied in the two path early on the turn then dropped to the inside, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the runner-up at the
quarter-pole and gave way. ELOQUENT SPEAKER bumped with a rival at the start, was rated on the outside, came under urging in the four path on the
turn, moved to five wide outside the quarter-pole, chased into upper stretch and had nothing left. HALO CITY settled on the inside, dropped back leaving the
backstretch, saved ground under urging on the turn and failed to respond.

SHAKER SHACK hustled from the gate, knocked heads briefly with LAURA'S BELLAMY before easing off to prompt that rival from the outside three paths
off the rail, advanced in tandem with SHESADIRTYDANCER into the turn on the leader taking brief command inside the seven-sixteenths before being
headed by the runner up near the three-eighths, tucked to the two path at that station, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three wide into
upper stretch taking narrow command straightened away, dug in under threat dueling through to just inside the sixteenth marker before shaking away in the
late stages kept to task. SHESADIRTYDANCER four paths off the inside in range of the leader, advanced in concert with SHAKER SHACK to her inside to
overthrow the leader just inside the seven-sixteenths, took over command three furlongs from home, came under coaxing through the latter portion of the
turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, got headed for the front straightened away, dug in under a drive dueling through to just inside the sixteenth pole,
then got shaken off in the late going while clear of the rest to hit the finish second best. BUSTIN BAY broke in at the start bumping JILL'S A HOT MESS,
then got bumped herself by LAURA'S BELLAMY, who broke inwards, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for
home and improved position to procure the show honors. LAURA'S BELLAMY broke in at the start bumping BUSTIN BAY, came under coaxing and went
head to head briefly with SHAKER SHACK before establishing sole command to show the way in hand from the two path while under pressure from that
rival to the outside, came under threat from a pair into the turn and succumbed the lead inside the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing inside the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the stretch. JILL'S A HOT MESS bumped at the start by BUSTIN BAY, who broke inwards,
came under hustling and chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and
weakened. LAOBANONAPRAYER away a half a beat slow, chased inside briefly before tipping out to be five paths off the inside, went five wide through the
turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths and continued five wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BUBBLES ON ICE (IRE) angled in at the rear of the field early, went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved at the back, went three then four
wide on the far turn, passed the runner-up late on that bend and got first run, rallied six wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead outside the
furlong marker and held determinedly under strong urging. FLUFFY SOCKS was taken under a tight hold early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved
towards the rear behind tepid fractions, rounded the far turn in the two path while still in reserve, was beaten to the punch by the winner late on that bend,
swung five wide behind that foe into the stretch then moved to the outside, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed fast to just miss while clear for the
place. SLEEK LYNX (GB) rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, traveled around the far turn in the three path, was asked for her best in
upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while just up for the show. OYSTER BOX went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused
while four wide at the five-sixteenths, gained to make a bid in upper stretch but proved no match for the top two then narrowly lost the show. INGRASSIA
was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the rail on the far turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, raced behind horses past the
three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. BRAVO REGINA established a forward position early, raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the
pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path on the far turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole then came under a drive into upper
stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the furlong marker and weakened. FROST ME was asked to take the early lead, set the pace on the inside
through tepid fractions, was asked under heavy threat at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and faded.
