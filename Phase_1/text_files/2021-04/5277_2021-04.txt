Footnotes
EASTSIDE BOY raced within striking distance, came around the first turn on the outside, made a bid entering the home stretch and proved the best late.
CARRIER PIGEON challenged for the early advantage, took command around the second turn, couldn't hold off EASTSIDE BOY for the win, but was best
of others. SILVER KING pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. SILENT FORCE dueled on the front end,
saved ground around the final turn and faded. TONIGHTS STAR lacked early speed, had an outside trip, moved up and finished evenly. CHARMING
BULLET raced in the middle of the field, finished wide, while putting forth an even effort. FRANK THE MAYOR had an awkward start, racing in the back,
improved position, but was factor. TALKOTHTOWN void of early speed and was never close. OVERLYAPPEALING raced in the middle of the pack,
dropped back and was no threat late. MAN BEHIND THE BAR showed brief speed and dropped back.

Footnotes
HALFGLAMOROUS pressed the pace, being reserved, came around the final turn three wide, dueled down the stretch with INAWIC and prevailed for the
win. INAWIC raced within contention, saved ground around the second turn, dueled down the lane, was outfinished for the win, but was best of rest.
STEPH'S SPIRIT went to the front, drove clear and lacked a finish. KENYA STRIKE void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. MIDNIGHT
TRIP pressed the pace, saved ground around the second turn and tired. MAGGIE'S RETURN raced evenly near the back and was never a threat.
STREAMER had a tight start, raced in the back and was outrun.

at the wire. FRIDAY'S BEST pressed the pace, raced wide around the turn, ran a game third and was outfinished by the top two. LAST APPEAL vied for the
early lead, saved ground and hung. ANDIAMO GIACOMO lacked early speed, made a wide gain, but was no factor. BLAZING FIRE raced within striking
distance and faded. STRONG RULES raced near the middle of the field, saved ground and put forth an even effort. HOT LE ROY always raced near the
back and was never a threat. YES BAB raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn wide and retreated. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE void of early

Footnotes
WAR SONG sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task. TEN BUDS raced within striking distance, made a late bid, couldn't
catch the leader, but was a clear second. ALAN'S ARGUMENT pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and was a clear third at the wire. TRAELEE
raced in the middle of the field, came around the final turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was no factor. THIRSTY KAT lacked early speed, improved
position, but was no factor. ROUND QUARTER raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. CHEVEYO void of early speed and was never close.
YAMANO MAKER (JPN) raced within contention in the early part and made a steady retreat. COUNTACH always raced near the back and showed little.
BETTIN ON BRYAN raced in the middle of the pack, saved ground around the second turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
THETRASHMANSCOMING unhurried in the early part, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a wide bid and proved the best late. ICE
CRUSH raced in the middle of the field, came around the second turn wide, took command, but couldn't hold off the winner late. HONOR MY SPEED went
to the front, drove clear, saved ground and couldn't keep up with the top two down the lane. JOHNY'S BOBBY void of early speed, made a late gain, but
was no factor. COOL INDIVIDUAL raced near the middle of the field in the beginning, eased back and passed tired ones. LIAM SKYE vied for the early
lead, forwardly placed until late, lacked a finish and faded. SUPER FACTOR pressed the early pace and dropped back. SUCH raced within contention and
made a steady retreat. HE'S A CLIMBER had an awkward start and was never close. OUR BERMUDA raced within striking distance and stopped.
