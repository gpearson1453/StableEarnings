Footnotes
INDY RIDE, in touch prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue outside that foe to upper stretch, was floated out in the closing stages but prevailed under
firm hand urging. PREFERRED OUTCOME, urged inside a rival disputing the pace racing into the turn, shifted out in the closing stages carrying out his rival
contesting the issue to the end but was outfinished. OX TROT tracked just off the leaders along the rail racing to the turn, faded into upper stretch but
continued well enough to edge a rival for a share. D'URBAN PARK tracked off the first flight three wide in the opening stages, was prompted to lodge a brief
bid in that path on the turn but flattened out in upper stretch. DISCREET HEAT switched outside foes early tracking off the second flight racing in the four
path through the backstretch but offered no rally. BETWEENHEREANDCOOL tracked the leaders between foes, shifted out four wide entering the lane and
quickly came up empty.

Footnotes
DOHKO, reserved near the inside in early stages, shifted out splitting rivals after a half advancing to contention, steadily gained on the leaders angling to the
rail on the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then drove through nearing the furlong marker to wrest command and go clear under
firm encouragement. NO TIME TO YAWN, urged along the inside disputing the pace a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, dispatched a rival entering
the far turn, dueled between foes leaving the far turn into upper stretch but proved no match for the winner in the last furlong. BIJEMINI SLEW tracked off
the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide steadily gaining on the pacesetter entering the far turn to bid for command
nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. GOT FASHION broke awkwardly, was urged outside foes into the first turn to gain terms with the pacesetter
prompting that foe into the backstretch but gave way racing into the far turn. DOMINATOR tracked off the first flight three, then four wide into the backstretch
and steadily faded after a half. MR. SARCASTIC settled off the second flight off the inside and offered no rally. YADI dropped out early.

QUIET NO MORE, a bit outpaced despite some prompting in early stages, gathered some momentum outside foes on the turn, steadily advanced on the
leaders four wide into upper stretch and produced a sustained response to wrest the advantage and go well clear under firm handling. MI TIA CHRISTINA,
in touch with the leaders three wide between foes in the opening stages, prompted the pace three deep racing into the turn, pressed the issue past
midstretch and proved best of the others. LEDECKY tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out five wide racing through the
stretch and continued to improve position while prevailing for a share. TEE UP, urged between foes prompting the pace, dueled into upper stretch and gave
way in late stages. MAMBO DANCER, forwardly placed four wide in the opening stages, was eased off the first flight to track those foes outside a rival
racing into the turn but had no closing bid. I'LLMAKEYOUSMILE, urged inside rivals disputing pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way leaving
the furlong marker. GLOVANNA dropped out early. HEATHER HILLS hopped, then ducked out at the start, dislodging her rider, but walked off the course
under her own power.

Footnotes
HIGHRHYTHMDIXIE gained the advantage along the inside racing to the first turn, conceded the lead entering the backstretch, switched outside the
pacesetter after a half while readily advancing on that foe in the three path entering the far turn, took over racing in the four path nearing upper stretch and
widened the advantage late under firm handling. MAY BEAU tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the first turn, settled dropping back entering
the backstretch, was prompted to advance splitting rivals nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors between foes
nearing the wire. MONAD, off a step slowly, tracked off the second flight along the inside to the far turn, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch and
continued with an effort to improve position while missing for second. DARESCA tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, advanced on the far turn
to bid between rivals just off the inside nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. CROSS THE MERSEY, caught five wide tracking off the second flight
racing to the backstretch, made brief progress in that path on the far turn to gain striking distance but steadily faded in late stages. GRANDMARY, caught
four wide in second flight racing through the first turn, faded between foes racing into the lane. BOURN WILD AGAIN settled outside foes and failed to
menace. UNIQUE GIRL, urged to force the pace outside a rival racing into the first turn, went clear midway through the backstretch but emptied out abruptly
racing into the far turn. DAWNDETTI tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch and faded entering the far turn.

Footnotes
GIRL DAD broke outwards making contact with HEAT OF THE NIGHT, was righted, then rated between foes tracking just off the leaders into the
backstretch, angled inwards on the far turn while gaining striking distance, split foes just off the inside entering upper stretch, took over leaving the furlong
marker and kicked away under firm handling. HIGHLY NOTED, urged to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, turned back a rival's challenge
nearing upper stretch, dueled inside the eventual winner to midstretch and held for second while proving no match late. DELAWARE DESTROYER settled
off the second flight along the inside racing to the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and continued with interest between foes to prevail for a share. HEAT
OF THE NIGHT, off awkwardly, then bumped at the start, recovered to take up a position three deep in second flight racing to the first turn, was forced wide
nearing the backstretch avoiding FREELANCE momentarily, continued three deep into the second bend while being prompted to lodge a brief bid but faded
in the drive. WESTWARD LOOK was rated inside rivals in second flight racing into the far turn and faded in the drive. FREELANCE, urged to a forward
placing outside the pacesetter, drifted out on the first turn momentarily impeding a rival, shifted in on the backstretch to prompt the pacesetter to the far turn
and gave way abruptly into the lane. KAYAKER, caught in tight quarters at the start, settled outside a rival off the second flight racing to the backstretch but
offered no rally.

MAGIC SOLUTION, reserved between foes off the second flight in the opening stages, split foes, then steadily gained position just off the inside racing into
the bend, shifted out three wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady bid to wrest the advantage and edge clear in time under firm handling.
DIAMOND SLEW tracked the leaders four wide as part of the second flight in the opening stages, continued outside the eventual winner on the turn and
finished with interest to edge a rival for the place honors late. KISSMELIPS ducked out at the start, was quickly righted to attend a rival's pace under light
rating while conceding some position entering the turn, moved to press the issue nearing upper stretch gaining the advantage, briefly resisted the winner's
bid racing past midstretch but yielded to the top pair late. S K FLYER, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival in the opening stages, gained a brief
advantage racing into the turn and gave out leaving midstretch. BODACIOUS BLEND settled off the second flight while switching off the inside and
continued evenly to late stages. HONEY BEEST tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and faded into the stretch. GENERAL GINNY angled to
the inside early but soon dropped out.

SILVER TUNES broke sharply to gain the advantage, angled inwards dictating the pace on a narrow margin just off the rail racing into the turn, maintained
that margin into upper stretch, drifted inwards midstretch under right handed pressure crossing the path of PROPER MANNERS but held sway to the end
under pressure. The latter broke inwards bumping WISHFUL, was quickly collected off that foe while prompted to a forward placing along the rail stalking
just inside the pacesetter racing to the turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, was urged to challenge inside the leader entering the lane,
then was taken up and altered course outside that foe leaving midstretch, but narrowly prevailed for the place honors while failing to gain terms with the
pacesetter. PUGILIST angled to the inside tracking just off the second flight racing into the bend, shifted off the inside to split foes midstretch and continued
willingly to close the gap while just outkicked for the place honors. MOON ME AGAIN was urged prompting the pacesetter racing through the backstretch
into the turn, was fanned three, then four wide racing past midstretch and faded late. PROBABLY GRACE angled inwards while being rated just off the
second flight between foes racing into the turn but faded in the drive. WISHFUL, bumped from both sides at the start, switched outside foes to race four
wide into the turn and had no rally. U KNOW I B LION ducked out at the start bumping WISHFUL, was righted while switching out to race three deep
between foes in the last flight on the backstretch and soon dropped out. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF PROPER MANNERS LODGED A
CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SILVER TUNES FOR INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A
CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE INCIDENT, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SILVER TUNES FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING
HER SECOND.

Footnotes
HIDE THE DEMON angled to the rail in the opening stages, stalking just off the first flight, saved ground on the bend, swung out four wide entering upper
stretch while being prompted to challenge, took over leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm handling. PRENDIMI, urged to terms with the
pacesetter three wide between foes prompting the pace into the bend, pressed the issue between foes into upper stretch and edged a rival for the place
honors late while failing to match the winner. ASTRONAUT OSCAR broke sharply, shifted off the rail dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing into the
turn, dueled for command inside foes past midstretch but weakened in late stages. TUDOX EXPECTATIONS settled last while switching off the inside
racing to the turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. ARCADIA CALLS, urged between foes prompting
the pace from the outset to upper stretch, gave way in late stages. ZIPPING joined the pace four wide racing through the backstretch and gave way nearing
the lane.

Footnotes
NANCY WORK angled to the inside to track off the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued along the inside into the second bend, swung out four
wide in upper stretch and produced a solid closing response to wrest the advantage and go clear under firm handling. ESTILO ELEGANTE, caught in tight
quarters at the start, was reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, angled outside foes in upper stretch and produced a steady late response to
edge rivals for the place honors at the wire. IMPETUOSITY, a bit restless prior to loading, was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing to the first turn,
went clear on the second bend, held sway past midstretch but failed to sustain that momentum. V K STAR, bumped by TABLE ONE just after the start,
tracked just off the leaders inside foes racing to the first turn, switched out racing into the backstretch prompting the pace, lost some ground to the
pacesetter on the far turn, then angled inwards entering the lane but had no late bid. ABUELA CORI tracked off the second flight three deep racing to the
backstretch, was urged to make brief progress between foes nearing the far turn but came up empty in the closing stages. SIP'N DIP, caught three, then
four wide in second flight racing to the backstretch, continued in brief pursuit of the leaders outside foes to the far turn and emptied out. TABLE ONE ducked
out just after the start bumping V K START, was urged to contest the pace along the inside to the first turn, then into the backstretch and faded after a half.
C'EST PARTI tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, switched out racing into the backstretch and emptied out early. AWESOME GAP settled
outside foes racing to the first turn and failed to menace thereafter. STILLHER dropped out early.
