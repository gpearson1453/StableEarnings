ONE FABULOUS BOY keen, best late. SIR VYVAL dueled well inside winner. BP CK EAGLE broke in, drifte din, impeded foes. JM CORONA 08 clean trip
outside. SHESA LITTLE BIGTIME never factored. JESS RIDE MY WAGON shied, tightened foes. EAGLE LIT broke very slowly. PAINT YOUR LEGACY
fractious in gate, broke in, hopped, bumped foe, crowded partway, checked. LA NINA DE ORO broke very slowly, altered course outside. BLAZIN
MAGICIAN bumped early, shut off at rail, checked sharply, lost action. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE EARLY STAGES OF THE
RACE AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED JESS RIDE MY WAGON FROM SIXTH AND PLACED HER LAST FOR MOVING INWARD, CAUSING
PAINT YOUR LEGACY AND BLAZIN MAGICIAN TO CHECK SHARPLY.
