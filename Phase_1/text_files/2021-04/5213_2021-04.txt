Footnotes
CRIMSON ZIP vied for the early lead, drove clear, was all out and held off a late running FLAT OUT LOVE for the win. FLAT OUT LOVE raced in the middle
of the field in the early going, made a late rally, was gaining on the leader and needed more ground. LAURIANO challenged for the early lead, saved
ground, raced close throughout, while putting forth a game effort. FLASH ME BACK lacked early speed, made a late mild bid, racing wide and was no
factor. FAST DUDE raced near the back in the early part, came around the second turn on the outside, moved up racing wide and was no threat. EXTRA
DOUGH raced within striking distance, came around the second turn on the outside and weakened. BLUEWATER CAT had a tight start, raced near the
back and was never a threat. G CISIVE raced in the middle of the pack, came around the first turn on the outside and faded. DIPLOME always raced near
the back, finished wide and was outrun. INDICATIF pressed the early pace and retreated.

COOL SPRING dueled for the early advantage, drove clear and held on under steady urging. MISS OCEAN EXPRESS raced near the back in the early
part, moved up on the outside around the turn, was carried wide by UNTETHERED SOUL coming out of the turn, rallied and was getting to the winner.
UNTETHERED SOUL raced within contention, drifted out entering the home stretch, made a mild bid and got up for show. POOPSIE DOOPSIE raced
within striking distance, saved ground around the turn, made a bid and hung. TIZ THE TIME dueled on the front end, saved ground and faded. HARLONS
COMMISION had an awkward start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LIGHTHAWK hopped at the start, racing in the rear, moved up inside around the second turn, angled out, dueled down the lane and prevailed for the win.
GO GET THAT sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground, dueled down the lane and was outfinished for the win. TOP BRASS raced contention, came
around the first turn on the outside, proved no match for the top two and followed them to the wire. APPLEWOOD lacked early speed, entered the final
stretch wide, made a mild bid, but was no factor. I'LL RAISE YOU lacked early speed, entered the final stretch wide and put forth an even effort. SUMMER
APPEAL always raced near the back, wide into stretch and was never a threat. BYE BYE BIRDSTONE showed early speed and dropped back. THE
TRAINER OF #3 GO GET THAT LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #2 LIGHTHAWK FOR INTERFERENCE DOWN THE HOME STRETCH. AFTER
VIEWING REPLAYS STEWRDS TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
DECEMBER SEVEN went to the front, led throughout, pulled away and was ridden out. ITS A WRAP pressed the early pace, raced outside around the first
turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. TAPAGE vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top
two. MAROON MANIAC void of early speed, moved up, but was no factor. NIPPY RED raced near the back, came around the final turn on the outside,
made a bid, faded and was no threat late. HOUR CITY raced evenly near the back and showed little. STEPHEN'S ANSWER raced within contention, saved
ground and faded.

ROSE CROWN raced within striking distance, drove clear down the stretch and finished well. LOUISIANA'S HOPE vied for the early lead, forwardly placed
throughout, drove clear around the turn, but proved no match late for the winner. BIND ME UP had a tight start, racing near the back, made a steady gain
and got up for show. CARONDELET raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid, but was no factor. SWEET PRAYERS pressed the early pace, raced
wide around the first turn and weakened. AMORE'S PRAYER lacked early speed, finished wide and passed tired ones late. SUMMERTIME BANDIT
challenged for the early advantage and faded. BUILDING HOME dueled on the front end and was finished early. LAST DESTINY void of early speed and
was never close. FORT PIKE raced near the back and showed little.
