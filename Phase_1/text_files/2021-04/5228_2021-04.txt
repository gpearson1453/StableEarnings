Footnotes
SMOOKIE angled to the inside to set a pressured early pace then gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, drew to even terms leaving the eighth
pole, took the advantage mid-stretch and held well with steady encouragement. DOMS LADY was brushed lightly on the chute, closed to the lead between
horses approaching the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, dug in at even terms leaving the eighth pole, gave up the lead mid-stretch but stayed
on gamely to the finish. LINEAGE chased the early pace inside, came between horses leaving the quarter pole and left the turn three wide, then finished
well to close the gap. NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE came out to make light contact with Doms Lady on the chute, steadied behind a narrowing opening
approaching the three eighths pole then raced wide on the turn. J C THE DESTROYER gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn and showed little in
the lane. PAINT ME PRETTY chased the pace and raced close in the three path of the turn but bore out nearing the head of the lane and weakened.

steady stretch encouragement. TRUE PURPOSE took the lead between horses at the five sixteenths pole then gave chase past the pole, dropped back
midway on the turn, though, finished well in second. SILKEN BELLE chased the earlier pace inside, angled to the four path into the stretch, came along for
third mid-stretch and finished well. SISTER ANNA set a pressured pace the opening quarter mile then gave chase from the five sixteenths pole, continued
close at the rail on the turn but weakened the final furlong. JUNA chased toward the outside, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little more.
ALPHARDINI chased outside and raced wide on the turn.

TRIPLE GALA rated off the pace toward the inside, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced off the rail most of the turn, angled to the five path into the
lane and dug in under steady urging to get up the final strides. HOLLYWOOD BROWN pressured the pace and dueled close in the three path of the turn,
dug in for the lead later yards but lugged in under right handed urging, was steadied, and caught, the final strides. I'M A TOTAL DIVA was hustled to the
lead inside and took over at the seven sixteenths pole, set a pressured pace from that point, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn but was
caught flattening stride later yards. VINTAGE SPARKLE chased through the backstretch, raced in the three path entering the turn, angled to the five path
toward the head of the lane and finished well while gaining on I'm A Total Diva. MY PRETTY EYES chased the early pace toward mid track, rounded the
turn off the rail and finished well. ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY broke awkwardly then chased toward the inside, raced close at the rail on the turn but flattened
stride inside the sixteenth pole. CASTLE'S TUFFY raced wide on the turn. FIGHT LIKE CERSEI was not a factor.

TALKTHETALK rated off the early pace about the three path, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep midway on the far turn, raced
clear at the eighth pole and held well, driving. ESTHER'S FORTUNE raced well off the pace and off the rail the first turn then eased out into the backstretch,
picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded most of the far turn off the rail, angled out toward the head of the lane and dug in to take
second later yards. FINDER ANGEL R V F saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then
weakened in the stretch duel for second. COOL ENOUGH angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, gave
up the lead at the rail midway on the far turn, dropped back leaving the turn then faded in the lane. ROSALENE raced well off the pace mostly saving
ground. WHYCANTTHISBELOVE settled off the early pace in the two and three paths then showed little response through the backstretch.

ROCK BREAK took over nearing the half mile pole and rated a slim lead, came under pressure into the turn, contested the edge at the rail through the turn
then dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. NOCASHREFUNDS chased through the backstretch and rounded the turn off the rail, dueled for
second past the eighth pole and was gaining on the winner. CHARITABLY GIFTED engaged in close chase and contested the turn two deep, but drifted to
the five path approaching the top of the stretch and flattened stride. GOLDEN METTLE gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly down the
lane. WESTBURY ESTATES gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn and showed little more. CROSSTHEBAY chased through the backstretch,
rounded the turn in the four and five paths then weakened. SUN AND SALT brushed the gate on exit and raced well back.

NORTHERN RIDGE took over leaving the gate and rated a slim lead, kept the advantage over NAZCA MYSTERY through the backstretch, was urged clear
past the quarter pole then steadily handled down the lane, while the latter ran with the early pace then challenged at even terms from the half mile pole,
engaged in close chase through the backstretch, but dropped back at the quarter pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and was steadily encouraged to
hold on for second. DEPUTY JAMES rated close about the three path the first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch, came through the far turn off
the rail, angled to the four path leaving the turn and was gaining on the runner-up. MAN OF THE NIGHT steadied at the start and settled off the pace,
picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then weakened. RUCKER rated close to the early pace inside, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded while losing ground on the far turn.

BE BE BOP chased inside through the backstretch but lost momentum off the heels of IMPETUOUS through the turn, came inside that one at the rail and
took the lead past the eighth pole, dug in determinedly from that point and inched clear under the wire, while the latter, took over nearing the seven
sixteenths pole and kept the edge over Vic's Pick through the backstretch, contested the rail on the turn, was caught past the eighth pole and dueled close
to late stretch before reluctantly yielding. COMMAND THE CAT chased from the outside, rounded the turn about the five path, dug in for third inside the
sixteenth pole and finished well. YOU GO BOY chased outside, rounded the turn in the six path and finished well to pass rivals outside.
MYWALKTOFREEDOM chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened. SHACKLED gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about
the four path and showed little more. VIC'S PICK pressured the pace from the seven sixteenths pole, raced close in the three path of the turn then faded
through the lane.

FLOATING BY rounded the opening turn in the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, steadily progressed to take the lead at the quarter pole,
widened on the far turn and continued to increase her margin under steady stretch handling. LIKE ME OR NOT was hustled along through the front stretch
then rated a short lead inside from the five eighths pole, came under pressure at the three eighths, drew briefly clear from the five sixteenths but was caught
at the quarter pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, proved no match for the winner and just lasted in second. FRENCH NOUGET rated off the pace inside
the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, dug in leaving the eighth pole and just missed
second. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW rated close off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole and stayed in range of the
lead through the backstretch, came through the far turn about the three path then flattened stride. LADY'S CORK saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the
seven sixteenths pole and was eased to the five path of the far turn, but showed little more in the lane. MIDNIGHT CROSSING settled off the pace into the
