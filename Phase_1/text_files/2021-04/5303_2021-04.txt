Footnotes
MIDNIGHT TEA TIME tracked from midpack along the inside, swung five wide turning for home, rallied through the lane to take aim on BYE BYE MELVIN
inside the furlong pole, and edged past that foe a few strides before the wire. BYE BYE MELVIN stalked three to two wide, bid for the lead in upper stretch,
forged an advantage approaching the furlong pole, but was nailed by an oncharging rival approaching the wire. ARGENTELLO (IRE) was taken back off of
the pace while a bit keen from restraint passing the wire for the first turn, settled far off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn two wide, altered out
from behind traffic to the five path passing the furlong pole, and surged approaching the wire, but ran out of ground to catch the leaders. IMPERADOR
(ARG) bobbled slightly at the start, lied off of the pace two wide around the turns, came into the lane three wide, then stayed on well through traffic while
chasing from behind the leaders through the final furlong. GREYES CREEK tracked from midpack two wide, then four wide around the far turn, grinded
away through upper stretch to attempt a bid at the furlong pole, but was outkicked by an outer foe passing that marker, then tired through the final sixteenth.
SPANISH KINGDOM lied off of the pace along the inside, got rank and was hard to handle around the first turn, settled down approaching the five furlong
pole, then saved ground thereafter, but to no avail. ARTIE'S RUMOR trailed, took the far turn four wide before swinging six to seven wide in upper stretch,
but failed to make an impact. SPLIT THE WICKETS hopped at the start, lied far off of the pace three wide, swung five to six wide entering the lane, but
lacked a rally on his left lead. PERFECT SPEIGHTY stalked two wide around the first turn, then from along the inside around the far turn, but chased
through upper stretch without progressing, and weakened between horses through the final furlong. TROUBLING MOON tracked from midpack three wide,
inched closer to a stalking position down the backstretch, but faded through the lane. SUMMER ASSAULT set the pace along the inside, but was headed at
the three sixteenths pole, and weakened.

Footnotes
FRENCH TOAST stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, inched closer to bid for the lead approaching the final
sixteenth, and drove clear. SOMETIMES ALWAYS stalked two wide, bid for the lead turning for home, dueled as his inner counterpart dug in, but was
outkicked by an outer rival a sixteenth out. ABDAN set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist SOMETIME'S ALWAYS's bid entering the lane, dueled
through midstretch, but gave way with a sixteenth to go. BUGLER trailed early on, rallied three wide around the far turn to a tracking position entering the
lane, but flattened out in upper stretch. KNOPFLER lied off of the pace in the two path around both turns, but never got involved. DEVOTED TO YOU
tracked from midpack two wide, but came under a drive into the far turn, and weakened passing the five sixteenths pole. PLUTONIUM tracked from midpack
along the inside, but weakened into the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
MAVEN broke sharp and cleared off early on, maintained that clear margin in hand around the turn, was let out approaching the three sixteenths pole with
BOLDOR in pursuit, responded well, and safely held sway from that rival to the wire. BOLDOR stalked two wide, inched closer to the clear leader in upper
stretch while on his left lead, but failed to reach that foe before being repelled in the final furlong, but stayed well clear of show. JOKER ON JACK lied off of
the pace three wide around the turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and stayed on to achieve show at the sixteenth marker. GUILDSMAN (FR) tracked
from midpack two wide, forged show while shifting three wide passing the quarter pole, but lost that position at the sixteenth marker. BAD BEAT BRIAN lied
off of the pace along the inside, took the turn in the two path, swung five wide in upper stretch, but failed to factor. SMART REMARK tracked from midpack
along the inside, but never got involved. ANOTHER MIRACLE was off slowly, trailed, and was outrun. EDGEMONT ROAD stalked along the inside, chased
around the turn, and faded turning for home. DUE TO THE BEAM FOR THE HALF MILE TIME BEING OBSTRUCTED THE HALF MILE TIME WAS
HAND-TIMED..

Footnotes
INJECT stalked along the inside, shifted to the three path approaching the five sixteenths pole to be outside of the clear leader, produced a bid entering the
lane while getting floated to the four path by that foe, sparked a three pronged duel in upper stretch as MISCHIEFFUL made a rail bid, battled under a long
drive, and prevailed over that foe at the wire. MISCHIEFFUL broke a step slowly, saved ground off of the pace, hugged the fence while advancing turning
for home, produced a rail bid inside of a pair off foes in upper stretch, dueled inside of those rivals before forging a narrow advantage approaching the final
sixteenth, but was nailed on the wire by her outermost counterpart. R WORKING GIRL cleared off early on, maintained that clear advantage while staying a
path off of the inner railing, shifted to the three path entering the lane while meeting INJECT's bid, fended off that foe through upper stretch while meeting
MISCHIEFFUL's rail challenge, dueled between those rivals passing the furlong grounds, but gave way to those foes a sixteenth out. DEALING JUSTICE
chased two wide while in the three path, got floated to the four path at the five sixteenths pole, then to the five path entering the lane, but faded in upper
stretch. SA FORADADA trailed early on, saved ground far off of the pace around the turn, but to no avail. MISS MARLEY tracked from midpack in the three
path around the turn, but faded. CHOCTAW BINGO lied off of the pace two wide, but was done early.

Footnotes
COASTANA tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted to the two path turning for home, tipped out three wide at the three sixteenths pole, rallied
through the final furlong, and edged past the leader late. FLIPPANT was keen to place early on, settled far off of the pace in the two path, shifted ground to
the five path while searching for racing room behind a wall of rivals in upper stretch, steadied behind that traffic before tipping out six wide in midstretch, and
sustained a rally through the final furlong to reach place. SHUSH set the pace along the inside, inched clear from a pressing rival in upper stretch, dug in
passing the furlong marker, but was bested approaching the wire. CURLY WURLY stalked along the inside, attempted to rally inside of COASTANA in
midstretch, but was outkicked by that foe at the furlong pole while shifting off of the rail, then chased that rival home from between horses late. COLONEL
ABY B saved ground off of the pace, split foes at the furlong pole while improving, but failed to menace. KIND WAYS tracked from midpack two to three
wide, but faded five wide in upper stretch. BALLYMORE STAR (IRE) lied off of the pace in the three to two path around the first turn, came under a drive at
the five sixteenths pole, swung six wide in upper stretch, but failed to rally. MAID OF HONOR vied for the lead two wide, but failed to keep pace with her
inner counterpart in upper stretch, and weakened between horses at the furlong pole. ADMAA stalked three wide, but faded between horses in upper
stretch. ZZA ZZA ZOOM was rank early on, trailed throughout, and was outrun.
