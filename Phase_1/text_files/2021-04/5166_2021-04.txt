Footnotes
SWIRLING CANDY set the pace along the rail, turned back a bid from the runner-up in midstretch and widened under a drive. TRUE HEIRESS stalked the
winner from the rail, angled two wide near the quarter pole, bid in upper stretch but was no match in the final furlong. AFFICIONADO (FR) raced off the pace
two wide and had a mild rally to gain the show. I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT became erratic and was checked leaving the half-mile pole, raced two wide around
the turn and rallied belatedly. SWEETLY MAID prompted the winner two wide and faded. FIGHTRESS failed to menace while racing three wide.
WEDONTBELIEVEHER checked leaving the half-mile pole and made little impact inside.

Footnotes
SYSTEMATIC saved ground well within range early, ranged up outside the leaders three wide after six furlongs, dueled outside OGLALA through the last
eighth of a mile and was all out to prevail. OGLALA lunged and veered out at the start spotting the field several lengths, recovered three wide into the first
turn, bid between horses with five-sixteenths remaining, battled inside SYSTEMATIC past the eighth-pole and stayed on stubbornly. CHICA BOOM tracked
outside AWILDAS TREASURE for a half-mile, took over and moved inside briefly getting clear into the far turn, came under fire from two challengers soon
after that, and yielded on the rail in upper stretch. DANZATALE raced two wide on the turns, and failed to seriously menace. TIZOFADEAL steadied along
inside under a firm hold early, and was empty when roused. AWILDAS TREASURE vied inside CHICA BOOM for a half, and retired. RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.

I'M A COCO PEBBLES was reluctant to load, stalked the pace two wide, advanced three wide from the three-eighths pole, seized command outside of foes
in midstretch and drew clear under a drive. MARICOPA was fractious in the gate, stalked the pace three wide, took the lead leaving the three-eighths pole,
drew clear around the turn, drifted out in the lane and yielded leaving the eighth pole. HOLY SECRET set a rated pace inside and weakened in the lane.
BRODY'S HONOR was away alertly but shut off near the six and half furlong grounds and dropped back to last, made progress four wide around the turn
but came up empty in the lane. CAPTURED LIGHT pressed the pace two wide and was through after a half. QUEEN ASHY BABY was outrun in the two
path.

YELLEN raced close up three wide to the stretch, wrested command outside ZIP IT JESS entering the final furlong and drove clear. COOKIE COVE was
outsprinted two then three wide around the turn, finished willingly and was up between horses for second. ZIP IT JESS pressed PRINCESS CORO from
outside early, took over after three furlongs, then was outfinished. MAJIC FLASH was outrun early, came four wide off the turn, and was no late threat on
the far outside. SMACK saved ground in range early, entered the stretch with little maneuvering room behind the leaders, then was outfinished when clear
past midstretch. PRINCESS CORO set the pace inside for three-eighths of a mile, and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
DR JACK pressed the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, quickly drew clear, drifted out a bit under mostly hand urging and held clear.
MYSTERY MO stalked the pace inside, angled three wide to split rivals nearing the lane and finished willingly to narrow the gap. GRAN RUNNER tracked
the pace three and four wide and was one-paced in the lane. MAYBE AFTER LATER raced four and five wide in midpack and lacked a rally. PROUD
CONTENDER stumbled badly at the start and never threatened while racing two wide. CPOWER set the pace along the rail and retreated from the
five-sixteenths marker. RAVE ON trailed inside.

Footnotes
PEARLESCENT tracked the pacesetters outside, bid three wide outside the leaders after six furlongs, and bested HURRICANE BREEZE after a struggle
through midstretch. HURRICANE BREEZE took command early, rated along inside through an even clip for six furlongs, dug in when confronted by two
challengers turning for home, and ran on stubbornly. I'LL DO IT MY WAY prompted the pace outside HURRICANE BREEZE, bid between that one and
PEARLESCENT near the quarter-pole, stayed on her left lead through the furlong grounds and weakened. LA RUSIA was two wide early and in range,
moved inside entering the far turn, and lacked the needed closing response. NOBLE MARIA was no factor two wide. OBSTINATE saved ground to the far
turn, swung four wide coming to the top of the lane, and made no headway. GREENWOOD DRIVE lacked room after the start brushing with MILLEFIORI,
and never reached contention. MILLEFIORI had her hind end brushed by GREENWOOD DRIVE shortly after the start, raced three to four wide, and moved
inside tiring on the far turn. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

DIAMOND PLAY settled off the pace two wide, angled three wide in upper stretch, closed outside and was up and clear late. ROSA STAR disputed the
pace inside, regained command leaving the eighth pole but could not hold off the winner late. I'M LISTENING tracked the early pace inside, bid three wide
into the far turn, took the lead two wide near the five-sixteenths pole, led to midstretch then weakened. SHORT POUR was wide into the first turn, angled in
to race two wide in midpack around most of that bend, edged closer three wide around the far turn but lacked a closing bid. WHAT A BEAUT was outrun
inside. SAMMY'S TOWN got out a bit entering the first turn, angled in soon after to move to the lead two wide, cleared off early on the backstretch, led
inside into the far turn and tired. PERSPIRE had brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
ONE FAST sped to the front early inside, widened the advantage around the turn, and was kept to a steady drive while drifting out through the stretch. I
KICKN broke in bumping BABY BROTHER, moved out five wide late on the turn, and rallied mildly outside to go clear for the place. FRANK ALONE
pursued ONE FAST from outside for a half-mile, weakened in the stretch but was best of the remainder. WICKED TEMPTATIONS posed no threat four wide
throughout. IT'S A RISK faded steadily inside. FLAMING HOT hung a left turn leaving the gate and veered in brushing the rail several lengths behind the
others, moved back outside up the backstretch and remained far back. BABY BROTHER was bumped by I KICKN at the start, raced two to three wide and
was through early.

Footnotes
BLUE LOU BOYLE (IRE) set a pressured pace along the rail, was headed midway around the far turn, battled on inside and edged clear late. THREE
AMIGOS (FR) pressed the winner two wide, took a short lead midway around the far turn, dueled past the eighth pole but was outfinished in the final
sixteenth. LUMBERJACK settled off the pace three wide, advanced three deep rounding the far turn, bid nearing the lane but could not match strides with
the top two in upper stretch. LIGHT CRUISER bumped with ASTROTURF at the start, saved ground in range and finished evenly. INDOCTRINATE tracked
the top two two wide and lacked a rally. ASTROTURF was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace early, went three wide around the far turn and
never threatened. DUNKLE failed to menace while racing two wide. SEVRIANO trailed inside. THE RUN-UP WAS UNAVAILABLE.
