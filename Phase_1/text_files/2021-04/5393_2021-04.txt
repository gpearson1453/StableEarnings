SAMURAI PRINCE set the pace from the onset, managed a clear advantage in the two path around the turn, and held well through the lane from a chasing
rival. BIG UNION stalked the clear leader from the outside, and chased that foe well through the lane. MAHOMES MONEY lied forwardly placed along the
inside, but tired through the lane before producing a bid. CITI CHARM lied off of the pace two wide, and never got involved. CUMBERLAND AVENUE broke
inwards and was last away, then trailed around the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
READY N WAITING established a clear margin early on, widened that advantage in upper stretch, then tired a bit through the late stages, but held safely.
JAIL HOUSE CODE lied far off of the pace three wide, gained four wide turning for home, sustained the rally while chasing the clear leader to duel for place
outside of VIDA YELLOW through the final furlong, and prevailed over that foe approaching the wire. VIDA YELLOW trailed along the inside, slipped inside
of foes entering the lane to claim place in upper stretch behind the clear leader, chased that rival into the final furlong as JAIL HOUSE CODE rallied
alongside, dueled for place inside of that rival through the late stages, but was bested. HALF LEGEND lied off of the pace in the two path around the turn,
and failed to factor. STANCHION chased the loose leader from along the inside, shifted off of the rail entering the lane, then tired between horses at the
furlong grounds. MENZEL stalked two wide, but weakened turning for home, was done early, and eased through the lane.

RELENTLESS DANCER prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, forged an advantage passing the three sixteenths pole, and edged clear
thereafter. BIG BELLA BROWN set the pace along the inside, showed the way inside of RELENTLESS DANCER around the turn, but was headed by that
foe inside the three sixteenths pole, yielded at the furlong marker, and tired through the late stages. LASTCHANCEATGLORY chased along the inside, but
failed to keep pace with the leading pair into the turn, shifted to the three path entering the lane while inside of LAND BATTLE, and fended off that foe for
show. LAND BATTLE lied off of the pace two wide, got floated to the four path entering the lane while attempting a bid for show, but hung for that position,
and failed to factor.

MY DARK SECRET lied off of the pace along the inside, chased the leading trio entering the lane, altered course out from behind those foes at the three
sixteenths pole, rallied to bid passing the furlong pole, edged an advantage a sixteenth out, and drove clear. MISS PINKERTON broke a bit awkwardly,
gained outside of foes down the backstretch to stalk the leading pair into the turn, inched close to bid for the lead entering the lane, dueled outside of
ISABELLE'S JOY through midstretch as MY DARK SECRET ranged up alongside, forged an advantage passing the furlong pole, but was headed by her
outer rival at the sixteenth pole. ISABELLE'S JOY stalked two wide, vied between horses around the turn, sustained the duel through midstretch, but yielded
a sixteenth out. SACRED STORM set the pace along the inside, vied inside of a pair of rivals around the turn, then gave way approaching the furlong pole.
LA NEGRA NOCHE chased the leader from the two path under heavy hand urging early on, but was done early. MY GIRL ROCKET was outrun.

Footnotes
LAUNCH PAD shied inwards at the start, lied off of the pace along the inside, gained three wide into the far turn, then sustained an extended rally under a
long drive through the lane to wear down the leader approaching the wire. PARROT HEAD vied three wide into the first turn, cleared inner foes into the
backstretch, loped along with low head carriage while maintaining that clear margin, kept well clear through upper stretch while hanging on his left lead,
changed leads at the furlong pole with LAUNCH PAD in pursuit, and was worn down by that foe inside the final sixteenth. MUSK trailed, took the far turn in
the four path, and stayed on outside of foes to claim show late. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK broke inwards at the start, vied inside of foes into the first turn,
rated back to stalk passing the seven furlong pole, saved ground inside of rivals around the far turn, but only managed to chase the leaders home without
progressing before fading. MR. FLATTERY vied two wide and between horses early on, allowed his outer counterpart to clear into the backstretch, but failed
to handle the wet going and required coaxing to keep pace, came under an all out drive at the half mile pole to sustain position between horses, then
weakened entering the lane.
