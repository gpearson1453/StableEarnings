Footnotes
DATA STORM broke alertly, cleared to the inside before a quarter, continued to show the way through the turn along the inside, held the runner up
comfortably safe the final furlong under steady handling. PAPA STAR chased off the inside, moved a bit closer in the turn, lost contact with the winner when
straightened for home, could not get back to that one while narrowly prevailing for the place. LUCKY BREAK forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch,
shuffled back along the rail with four furlongs remaining, second flight turn, rallied up the rail through the lane to just miss the second spot. SKYPED off a
step slow, remained back while saving ground through the turn, moved out for the drive, improved position with some late interest. TWISTED DIXIE went
one paced throughout while racind three wide. GENTLE KNIGHT broke back, asked along four wide in the turn, lacked a closing response. STOMPING
HOTROD within striking distance in some traffic, steadied in tight quarter just before a quarter, faded through the stretch. ONLY ICON was finished early.

Footnotes
ALEX'S STRIKE settled off the pace toward the inside early, swung to the outside exiting the turn to be four wide into the lane, closed full of run while well
out in the strip to be up in time. GOLDEN TIGER broke alertly, cleared to the inside, larger advantage through the turn, shook well clear by midstretch but
could not contain the winner. IMPUNITY settled within striking distance off the inside, crept closer three wide late in the turn, flattened out in the drive.
CARDIAC KITTEN chased the winner toward the inside, two path into the stretch, weakened in the drive. WICKED CITI settled off the pace and the inside,
three wide exiting the turn, failed to muster a closing response. NIALL lacked speed, was three out to four wide in the turn, also remained back when the
real running began at the head of the lane. HURRICANE JAKE fell back to trail soon after the start, fell further and further back in a dull effort.
COLLECTION ducked sharply just after the start, unseated rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, THE RESULT WAS
ALLOWED TO STAND.

MONTGOMERY PARK broke on top, showed the way into the turn along the inside, continued to hold a narrow advantage past the furlong marker,
shrugged off nearest pursuer soon after, clear late, fully extended to hold off the runner up in the waning strides. AIDANIKE in the second flight off the
inside, set down for the drive, closed well on the outside to be rapidly getting to the winner late. NORTHERN DIAMOND closest to the leader off the inside,
continued to press that one through the turn, lodged a brief bid from the outside in upper stretch then could not keep up. RIGHT TRAPPE broke back off the
winner, moved up and moved outside, three out early turn, asked along and came four wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. WHATS UP SWEETS
remained back throughout in failing to menace.

Footnotes
RAGGEDY ANNIE outrun for a half toward the inside, angled out to be four wide for the drive, set down, closed with good resolve to be in time. CANADIAN
GINGER bobbled and broke out to tighten up MISS MOON PIE, was straightened to move up inside to contest the issue into the turn, long drive, held a
narrow advantage late, proved stubborn to the end. CATECHISM with the early pace, vied between rivals into the lane, fell back off the issue a bit while
remaining between horses, battled back in game fashion to earn part of the place late. ZANSHOES in the second flight off the rail, moved up to contest the
issue three wide late in the turn, long drive, not enough in the late going for the second spot. COULD YOU forwardly placed while racing just off the inside,
had little left for the drive. MISS MOON PIE in tight at the start, raced back, steadied after a quarter toward the inside, stopped in the drive and trailed home
far back.

FAST SOPHIA in midpack early, raced three wide and in traffic when moving a bit closer late in the turn, engaged the leaders past the furlong marker, late
duel, proved best in a determined effort. EMERALDS R US moved up to duel after the start, continued to alternate up front through the turn, shook off the
other speed into the stretch, responded when joined from the outside by the winner soon after, proved stubborn to the end. HAMAZING LACE behind the
pace while racing toward the inside, boxed in along the rail late in the turn, got through, along for the show, not a threat to the top two. MOONSHINE
PRINCESS broke back, raced outside, came five out to six wide into the stretch, improved upper stretch, raced closest to the top two past the furlong while
remaining well out in the strip, outfinished for the show. CANCAN SAREE back off the pace toward the inside, two path through the turn, improved slightly
without posing a serious threat. MARCIAMARCIAMARCIA bobbled at the start to be last away, continued to lack speed, four out to five wide turning into the
stretch, staged a mild rally to also improve position a bit. TOMS MAXIMILLIAN away in good order, dueled up front along the inside, began to weaken
turning for home. HEART TO BREAK void of speed in trailing for a half, picked off some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. ALLOFOURDREAMS
prompted the pace while racing three wide, gave way. PRINCESS STRATEGY in mid pack while off the inside, steadily faded. CANDYSSONGDANCE
forwardly placed early just off the inside, stopped before a half.

ABROGATE broke with the field, with the pace between rivals, long drive, dug in late to prove best in a determined effort. JOYFUL CADENCE with the
leaders the opening quarter outside, pressed four wide into the end, vied three wide out, lost some ground to the two to her inside in falling back a bit in
upper stretch, trying to get back to the winner late, not enough in the late going while prevailing for the place. WINDMILL broke on top, narrowly set the pace
along the inside, dueled with the winner into the lane, proved stubborn until the late going while remaining closest to the rail of the first flight. DEVILISH WIT
last to leave, fell well back in trailing, saved some ground into the lane, picked off a tiring rival in the run to the wire while make little impact. SOUTHERN
GRAYCE prompted the pace in the three and and between horses in the run up the backstretch, fell back off the first flight in the turn while remaining three
wide, backed up through the stretch to trail home. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO A MALFUNCTION WITH THE TIMING SYSTEM.

BEST YOU EVER SEEN allowed the pace to go early while racing outside, swept up three wide to challenge turning for home, drew strongly clear under a
brisk hand ride. NEWS FLASH broke sharp, set the early pace, vied three wide into the turn, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner while inside that
one turning for home, proved no match in the run to the wire, clearly second best. DRILL'S LI'L MAN raced off the pace and the inside up the backstretch,
dropped to the rail late in the turn, proved best of the rest by being along for the show late, no threat to the top pair. PADDY O'DINI broke back, dropped
inside to save some ground into the turn, steered out to be three wide for the drive, improved position slightly without posing a threat. HERE COMES DOC
last away, trailed for a half, picked up a couple of tiring rivals while never a serious factor. UNDERCOVER LOVER moved up inside the runner up the

Footnotes
MALIBU MARLEE off a step slow, back, advanced through traffic in the second turn to reach contention, challenged the leader nearing the furlong marker
and wore that rival down under steady handling. INTO VICTORY forwardly placed while saving ground first turn, tracked the leaders onto the backstretch,
squeezed through along the rail to challenge with less than a half mile remaining. CREATIVE LEGACY in the second flight while between rivals through the
second when slow to settle and rank, settled in the run up the backstretch, fanned four wide into the lane, rallied, finished willingly to narrowly miss the
place. FLATOUTANDFOXY void of speed while three wide through the first turn, continued outside, dropped to the rail in the second bend to improve into
the lane, lost crop with a furlong remaining, finished up evenly in lacking a further response. FLASHY BIZ four wide in the first turn when off the pace,
continued four wide into the far turn, fanned five wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. DUTCH TREAT pressured the pace off the inside, had little left.
LETTERS TO BELLE broke on top, set the pace off the inside for a half, allowed the runner up the inside late backstretch, vied with that one then gave way
turning for home.

Footnotes
DRENA'S STAR away well, got clear and to the inside before a quarter, continued to maintain daylight through the turn, steadily expanded that advantage
through the lane while being kept to task. NIFTY behind the first flight toward the rail, rallied three wide out of the turn to reach closest to the winner upper
stretch, chased that one past the furlong marker, proved no match for that one, clear for the place. HURRICANE HIGHWAY settled off the pace inside,
came in the two path for the drive, brushed with MADISION'S LUNA past the furlong marker, outkicked that one for the show while not a serious threat to
the top two. MADISON'S LUNA lacked speed, came three wide when called on for run out of the turn, brushed midstretch, outkicked for the show.
NUCLEAR OPTION stalked the pace while three wide, moved closer on the turn then flattened out in the drive. GRAY ATTEMPT closest to the winner,
dropped inside midway on the turn, had little left for the stretch run. GORDY FLORIDA broke in a tangle, was never close.

CAVE RUN behind the pace inside, patiently handling while continuing to save ground turn, got through into the lane, protracted stretch drive, headed inside
the furlong grounds, battled back in game fashion and proved best under firm handling. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK in the second flight off the inside, tipped
out to be four wide turning into the stretch, set down, bid. IMPRESSED back off the pace, in some traffic late in the turn, waited while continuing in tight
quarters upper stretch, shifted out slightly, finished willingly to be getting to the top two late. BREAKING NEWS void of speed, improved through inside
some traffic late in the turn, bothered nearing the furlong marker, finished up evenly to be no threat to the top three. PRINCIPE GUILHERME last away,
raced back, behind traffic into the lane, improved a bit when clear the final furlong. TRASHTALKINYANKEE lacked early speed while well out in the strip,
four out to five then six wide turn, went evenly in the drive. WELL CONNECTED away well, narrowly set the pace for a half in the two path, faltered in the
drive. PALVERA forwardly placed outside, was beginning to tire when floated out five wide into the lane, continued to falter through the stretch. BUTTERED
NOODLES pressed the issue for a half in the three path, was giving way when he lugged in nearing the furlong marker to bother BREAKING NEWS,
continued to falter. DEFLATER broke back, was used early to move up to a forward position four wide into the turn, gave way while five wide late in the

Footnotes
PAULINE'S PEARL broke with the field, four wide into the first turn, angled in a bit, continued to track the pace three wide in the run up the backstretch,
ranged up to try the leader from the outside turning for home, extended drive, wore that rival down under steady handling. AVA'S GRACE broke on top,
showed the way into the first turn, rated through some legitimate fractions the middle half, put her closest pursuer away midway on the second turn,
responded when the winner challenged soon after, gave ground grudgingly to that rival down the stretch, lasted for the place. COACH unhurried early, crept
a bit closer in the second turn, angled four wide into the lane, steadily getting to the runner up late while remaining out in the strip. TAKE CHARGE LORIN
pressed the runner up into the first turn in the three path, moved closer to challenge into the far turn then could not keep up, gradually weakening in the two
path in the run to the wire. SYLVIA Q within striking distance along the inside, came up empty for the drive. WEST SIDE GIRL fell back to trail after the start,
failed to muster a response.

Footnotes
GREEN LIGHT GO moved up to be clear into the first turn, dueled in the run up the backstretch in the two path, headed second turn, extended stretch
battle, proved narrowly best late in a determined effort. BRUDER BOB moved up to press the issue through the first bend, dueled the middle half, put a
head in front midway on the final turn, long drive, outkicked in the late going while prevailing for the place. TRIDENT HIT settled off the pace just off the
inside, moved a bit closer in the second turn, tipped out to be three wide into the stretch to lose some ground to the top two, set down getting back to that
pair late. BEAVER HAT settled in the second flight off the inside, remained within striking distance turning for home, blocked in some traffic past the furlong
marker, altered course to the outside, displayed some modest late interest to close some of the gap on the leaders late.. PROVERB forwardly placed,
continued to stalk into the far turn, floated out four wide turning for home, went evenly through the stretch. MO MOSA one paced while three wide, lacked a
finishing kick with an even effort. FAST BREAKIN CASH last away, trailed early, remained back. MURALIST was never a threat.
