Footnotes
SHES OUR FASTEST dueled for the early lead on the inside, shook clear entering the stretch, then drew off in the final furlong to prove much the best
under a mild drive. ZARELDA was allowed to settle early, angled out in the stretch for racing room, rallied well for the pace reward. IMA DISCREET LADY
dueled for the early lead in between rivals, then faded in the drive while saving the show. HEAVENLY RHYTHM was allowed to settle early, came into the
stretch six wide, offered no rally while passing the faders. BOERNE dueled for the early lead three wide then weakened. GONE BABY GONE failed to
menace. DUSTWHIRL WONDER was not a threat. HAPPY SAILOR chased the early pace and tired.

Footnotes
RISKEY TRICKEY pressed the early pace three wide, made a bid past the quarter pole three wide, shook clear, then drew off final furlong to prove much
the best. K C TIZ MORO dueled for the lead on the inside, proved to be no match for the winner while being second best. PROUD TO SERVE came in to
the stretch three wide but offered no rally while being up for the show. BONHAM made a middle move before flattening out. DOC'S GOLD chased the pace
on the inside but weakened. HANDSOME LAD failed to menace. WITT'S TAQUITO was not a factor. ON THE HONOR ROLL chased the early pace in
between rivals then weakened. CHACHING BLING was not a threat. PAPAWS BOY stopped.

Footnotes
UPTOWNBLINGITHOME advanced along the inside into and through the turn, tipped out and took over with three-sixteenths to run, shook clear, was kept
to task and held. CHIKARA was allowed to settle off of the inside, took closer order through the bend, angled out four wide into the lane, kicked on and was
just up to earn the place. QUICK QUICK QUICK settled in hand, ranged up to make a bold bid three deep leaving the turn, but flattened and settled for the
minor award. STORMIEIS BLUE was unhurried off of the inside, looped four wide into the stretch and finished with a mild improvement. SAINT MOON
tucked in to save ground, moved up on the turn, shifted out and around a tiring rival in upper stretch, dropped back to the rail, offered a mild bid but failed to
sustain the drive. RAIDER lagged at the tail of the field and failed to make headway. ALOHA BETTY sprinted clear, set a cracking pace through the turn and
stopped.

TEXAS CROSSBOW was well rated early, made a four wide move on the turn, hit the front entering the stretch, then drew off to prove much the best under
a drive. WINGS FOR ENO vied for the early lead on the inside, proved to be no match for the winner while saving the place. FIRST BUMP RIDGE was
reserved early, came five wide into the stretch, rallied well. MOONSHINERBOY was allowed to settle early on the aside, swung out four wide for the stretch
drive to have a belated rally. COWBOY RIDGE was well placed on the inside, awaited room on the inside by the quarter pole, but offered no bid. RUSH
THE COLORS pressed the early pace in between rivals then weakened. TWO STEPPING DISCO failed to menace. GOOD AMERICAN was lugging out on
the turn then weakened. CAPTAINS COVE broke in a tangle, no threat. MORO JETSETTER pressed the early pace three wide, went bad approaching the
quarter pole and was pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
BUBBLE LINE prompted the pace to the outside of WITT'S GIRL to the turn, settled off of that one on the bend, reengaged entering the lane, wore that foe
down and edged clear. WITT'S GIRL set the pressured pace along the inside, opened clear on the turn, fought on through a long drive, was unable to go on
the winner but dug in for the runner up spot. EUROSTREET was allowed to settle, advanced between rivals on the turn, worked through traffic in the drive
and kept on well. WIMBLEDON'S GOLD settled into stride, circled six wide to make a mild bid but failed to sustain the drive. OUTSMARTED settled saving
ground, got through but failed to make headway through the drive. AMANTE DE SARA contended along the inside to the stretch and weakened.
SOUNDSLIKEAWINNER was unhurried, angled to the far outside entering the stretch and finished with a belated improvement. DUCHESS OF ZMOR
moved to the outside into the turn and failed to threaten. NOT ENOUGH BLING was close up three deep, but faltered between runners on the turn and
retreated. MAKATEA made a middle move four wide but stopped after a half. CASTING PEARLS showed little.

Footnotes
SCARLETTSBLACKJACK was well placed early on the inside, made a inside bid to duel for the lead on the inside, then finished on even terms for the win
after a long drive. PICKENS set the early pace while racing off the rail, then dueled for the lead while three wide on the turn, drifted out final furlong,
prevailed late to finish on even terms for the win position. ST. LOUIE GUY chased the early pace three wide, then came into the drive four wide, was gaining
late but needed more. JACK'S ADVANTAGE chased the pace on the inside but lacked the needed winning bid. SAMURAI CAUSE was reserved early, then
was three wide by the quarter pole, belated rally. KOWBOY KARMA failed to menace. CROSSTIME raced towards the inside before tiring.

Footnotes
REVELATOR was sent to the front to set the pace, then remained clear to prove best while being kept to task. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE was off a step
slow, advanced on the far turn, came in to the stretch widest, closed well. WHITE TAIL DEER stalked the early pace three wide, lacked the needed stretch
bid, held show. GRAPHYTE was well placed early on the inside, was shuffled back on the turn, then had a belated rally. TURBULENT SKY was reserved
early, swung out seven wide for the drive. BURNZ DA BOSS was allowed to settle early, had to alter course in stretch, but offered no significant. OSWALD
COBBLEPOT was allowed to settle early and was wide throughout, came in and bumped a rival in the stretch while coming up empty. OXFIRE was allowed
to settle early, came four wide into the drive, was bumped hard leaving the eighth pole, tired. STRATEGIC AFFAIR failed to menace. SCHEMER tracked the
pace four wide then gave way. The stewards posted the inquiry sign concerning the stretch run, after viewing the replays they deemed to be no change.
