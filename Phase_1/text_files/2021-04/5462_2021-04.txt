Footnotes
HEY HEY chased the leaders in the opening stages, dropped back to settle in the middle of the pack for what remained of the backstretch, began a bid from
the three path nearing the three eighths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew off under a drive to the wire. KENAI COOL trailed the field on the inside
up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began to gain ground between horses in upper stretch, and drifted out mildly in the final furlong. LADY
EXPRESS trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained
ground on the outside down the lane, while proving to be no match for the winner. CAN SHE SCOOT dueled for the lead on the outside through the opening
three eighths of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn, began to drop back entering the stretch and continued to fade from there. R MARIE dueled for
the lead on the outside up the backstretch and into the turn, saved ground around the turn, and tired entering the stretch. THE QUARTER MILE TIME WAS
ELECTRONICALLY RECORDED AND THE CORRECT TIME IS AS SHOWN ON THE CHART AS OPPOSED TO THE REPLAY.

Footnotes
IRISH LIGHTED ROAD was placed on the lead, set the pace clear while saving ground into the turn, floated out three wide into the lane and increased his
advantage when pushed along in upper stretch, was driven midstretch and was always in command. CHARLIE'S HEIR was bumped by OFF TO THE
BEACH in the opening strides, tracked the pace inside of HATCHET CREEK early, tracked the leading pair past the middle of the backstretch, was carried
out by DISTINCT THUNDER approaching the half, dropped in to save ground while tracking the leading trio around the bend, was driven inside into the
lane, responded with a rally, proved no match for IRISH LIGHTED ROAD but kept on second best. DISTINCT THUNDER chased midpack down the
backstretch, was taken out approaching the half mile mark, took closer order in the three path on the turn, was driven three wide into the lane, kept on
willingly while drifting out and was outfinished for the place. ROCKET RIDE settled near the rear, continued well off the pace in the two path on the turn,
swung out four wide into the lane under a drive, took mildly closer order, angled in past the furlong mark, but chased on only evenly late. WHITE MIST
chased midfield down the backstretch, and two wide outside of ROCKET RIDE on the turn, floated five wide into the lane and went to a drive, but lacked the
needed kick. EL FEFO bobbled in the opening strides, settled in the rear flight inside of OFF TO THE BEACH, raced in the two path on the turn while still
toward the rear, was pushed along inside horses in upper stretch, and failed to muster the needed rally. OFF TO THE BEACH came in and bumped
CHARLIE'S HEIR in the opening strides, settled at the rear outside of EL FEFO, was hard urged in the three path on the turn, but lacked the needed
response. HATCHET CREEK tracked the leader outside of CHARLIE's HEIR early, continued to track the leader in the two path on the turn, proved no
match into the lane, was driven between horses in upper stretch, and faded.

CAN'T HIDE FROM ME chased the frontrunners between horses in the early going, angled out entering the turn to race on the outside, began a bid from the
three path approaching the three eighths pole, kicked clear entering the stretch, and drew off while drifting mildly in the final furlong. CONTRACTION broke
sharply, dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, backed off the pace while racing in the two path around the turn, moved up to duel on the
inside in upper stretch and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. LONG STATION trailed the field on the inside through the opening quarter of a
mile, navigated the turn from the two path, swung wide entering the stretch and improved position on the outside down the lane. SI ES GOYA was hustled
out of the gate to duel for the lead on the inside, took over while saving ground around the turn, and tired entering the stretch. MR. LUV MAKER trailed the
field on the outside up the backstretch, moved up slightly while racing in the three path around the turn and made no bid.

CHICKS FOR FREE down the backstretch, continued at the rear of a tight field while racing in the three path on the turn, kept on under a drive in the lane,
proved no match for the winner in the final furlong but persisted to get up in time for place over MIND YOUR OWN BIZ. The latter was fractious in the gate,
sent for speed inside, set a pressured pace down the backstretch and into the turn, was engaged by LOST IN MANHATTAN near the three eighths, vied
inside of that foe into the lane and to midstretch while all out, proved no match past the furlong mark, weakened inside and lost the place. CHICKS FOR
FREE tracked the leading pair inside of TALIS PARK GRAD, continued in the pocket just behind the leading pair on the turn, was driven near the five
sixteenths, proved no match for the leading pair under a drive into the lane, and lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
SMOKIN' JAY bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled in to stalk the leaders up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a
bold inside move nearing the three sixteenths pole and got up under the drive. ALPHALFA trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two
path around the turn, began to improve position in upper stretch and continued gaining to the wire. MERLIN'S SONG trailed the field on the outside through
the opening half mile, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground on the outside late. VALIANT VINNY dueled for the lead on the outside up
the backstretch, pulled clear to lead the field from the two path around the turn, and weakened in the final furlong. PALIO raced in the middle of the pack on
the outside up the backstretch, began to move up from the three path around he turn and flattened out in the stretch. OIL MONEY bumped with the horse to
his outside leaving the gate, pressed the pace on the inside early, dropped back to race in the two path around the turn and continued to tire from there.
AGGRESSIVITY stumbled and lost his rider leaving the gate, chased the field around the oval and walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE
REGARDING THE START. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
CAMMACK tracked the leading pair inside of CANDY STORE, continued patiently behind the leading pair while saving ground around the far turn, tipped
three wide near the three sixteenths under a drive, rallied while drifting out slightly, led past the sixteenth and drove clear. TAP THE MOJO tracked the pace
outside of THE GREEN MO'STER, raced keenly into the backstretch and briefly pressed outside of that foe during the backstretch run, engaged THE
GREEN MO'STER in earnest approaching the five sixteenths, wrested a brief lead from that foe approaching the sixteenth pole, had no answer to
CAMMACK past the sixteenth pole, but outgamed the pacesetter for place. THE GREEN MO'STER soon led inside, took some slight pressure from TAP
THE MOJO down the backstretch, cleared again approaching the turn, was engaged by TAP THE MOJO approaching the five sixteenths, carried a slim
lead past the furlong mark, was headed approaching the sixteenth pole by TAP THE MOJO, and was narrowly outfinished by that foe for the place. CANDY
STORE was hung four wide into the first turn, dropped in to chase just outside of CAMMACK, continued in that position down the backstretch and two wide
through the far turn, was driven approaching the lane, and offered a mild gain late. MEMORY BANK settled in the rear flight inside of BROTH, saved ground
through the far turn, was urged inside into the lane and offered a brief bid, but ran only evenly late. BROTH settled outside of MEMORY BANK in the rear
flight, continued two wide through the far turn, was driven in upper stretch, but lacked the needed rally.

WINDY CITY GIRL saved ground around the first turn, settled in behind the leaders on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid while saving
ground around the far turn, gained ground on the inside to get up for the lead and held off a late closer in the final strides to save the win. KINGSBURY
DREAM bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the
pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, and gained ground between horses down the
stretch, to just miss the victory. SUNDAY SCHEMING was away from the gate slowly, trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the
backstretch, began to improve position while racing in the three path around the far turn and continued to gain ground on the outside late. VEGAN GOES
BEST bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field from the rail through the opening half mile, continued to show the
way while saving ground around the far turn, was caught with a furlong to go and gave way late. ARCH FLYER raced in the two path around the first turn,
chased the leader up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and was outkicked in the final furlong. ROMANTIC ATTACK saved ground
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, made a bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole, raced in
contention in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. CATNIP KITTEN stumbled slightly leaving the gate, trailed the field on the inside around the
first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and made no bid. SUMMER EXPRESS raced in the two path around the first turn,
came up the backstretch between horses at the back of the pack, saved ground around the far turn and was empty from there. DUE TO A TIMING
MALFUCNTION, NO TIME IS AVAILABLE FOR THE SEVEN EIGHTHS SPLIT.

Footnotes
DUCHOSSOIS was bumped by RIO SECO in the opening strides, chased outside of OVERPRAISE through the clubhouse turn, chased the leading trio
down the backstretch, rallied three wide into the far turn, was driven from upper stretch to chase HONEST TO GOODNESS as that foe kicked clear into the
lane, kept on doggedly, reeled in HONEST TO GOONESS near the sixteenth and drove clear. HONEST TO GOODNESS was shut off in the opening
strides, settled at the rear, began to take closer order outside of CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT into the backstretch, launched a bid three wide into the second
turn, swept up sharply to engage the leading flight four wide approaching the quarter, kicked clear into the lane, but was caught approaching the sixteenth
and flattened late. UPHAM broke slowly and hopped at the start, chased outside of CAMPIONI around the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, was
pushed along three wide into the far turn and began to rally, came in on OVERPRAISE into the lane, chased on while all out in the lane and missed the
place. THE GRAY BLUR cleared to the lead, was engaged by RIO SECO to his inside down the backstretch, vied two wide into the far turn, continued two
wide between horses in the leading flight around that bend, was no match for HONEST TO GOODNESS into the lane, chased him inside to midstretch and
flattened out. CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT broke outward, settled in second last inside, was relegated to the rear into the far turn, raced in the three to four path
around that bend, swung five wide for the drive, and passed tiring horses. CAMPIONI chased midpack while saving ground, continued patiently around the
far turn, altered out in upper stretch, and chased on mildly while drifting out. RIO SECO cut inward and bumped DUCHOSSOIS into the first turn, tracked
the leader through the clubhouse turn, engaged inside of the pacesetter down the backstretch, vied into and through the far turn at the inside of the leading
flight, took up when in tight near the quarter pole, and weakened. OVERPRAISE tracked the leading flight while saving ground, was behind traffic
approaching the quarter pole as HONEST TO GOODNESS began to kick clear from the leading flight, steadied past the quarter pole when UPHAM came
in, and had no rally in the lane.
