Footnotes
ITSGOTTABEMYWAY was unhurried after a slow break, began a run along the inside after a half, came out wide on the final turn, reached the front nearing
the final sixteenth and drew out. BRANDYWINES SECRET stalked outside the early leader, moved two wide to a clear lead before three-quarters, took a
bad step approaching the wire, suffered catastrophic injuries to both front legs then was walked into the horse ambulance. PRIDE IN THE BIZ wasn't far
back along the inside for about six furlongs then weakened. STEADY ROCK improved position three wide between rivals around the final turn then flattened
out. STRAW HAT lagged early then made a late run past tired ones. RAISETONEW HEIGHTS raced two wide and tired. SWEET MAGIC MOMENT was
outrun. GRACEYGAB was caught wide around the first turn then stopped. JEWELS AND PEARLS was very wide around both turns and stopped.
UNPARALLELED was hustled to the front early on the first turn, made the pace to the far turn, stopped and was eased up.

Footnotes
PARANOIA stalked inside, moved to the front leaving the furlong grounds and held stubbornly. GIZMO FLASH took command at once, made the pace two
wide into the final furlong and continued with good courage. MISS DILLINGHAM was fractious in the gate, broke slowly, was sent up the rail early, came out
three wide on the turn to vie but lacked the needed closing. BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD wasn't far back outside to the turn then weakened. INTROSPECTION
stayed inside and made up some ground. KITTEN'S PEEBLES was no factor. VENUS RAMEY broke slowly, made a run three wide into the turn then
flattened out. TIZ PROMISING RVF was outrun.
