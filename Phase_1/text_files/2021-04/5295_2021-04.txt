Footnotes
ORNERY ANGEL was away in good order to press the pace of STARSHIP REINA while racing four-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing the
quarter, vied with that foe through a prolonged drive and edged away through the closing yards. STARSHIP REINA set a pressured pace while racing
three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the quarter, vied and gave way grudgingly through a vigorous drive. NOWITNA RIVER
lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. BUSTIN HEARTS tracked the leaders from the inside and gave way in
the drive. HOLIDAY CURLS was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EXCEED THE GOAL settled off the leaders early, advanced five-wide to take command into the stretch and drew off with complete authority. MARCHING
IN pressed the pace of NOTHINS FREE while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled out further in mid-stretch,
could not match strides with the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. NOTHINS FREE set a pressured pace from off the rail, gave way to
the winner after going a half, stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly. HOLY DIVER lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished
evenly late. BABIE MONSTER was forwardly placed from the inside throughout and lacked the needed late bid. ROSALDA showed brief speed and
weakened. PASZ THE PEPPER was off slow and lagged throughout.

to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths marker, gained a brief lead and gave way in the drive. POMPEY'S RULE chased the leaders while racing three-wide
and weakened after going a half. LINGUIST hesitated at the start, lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not menace. DISTINCTIVE
