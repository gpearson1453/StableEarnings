Footnotes
BASTET broke out at the start bumping DESPEIGHT ALL ODDS, raced four wide in aim of the front down the backstretch before advancing tucked three
wide through the turn to prompt the pace, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch heads apart for
command, took over the front with three-sixteenths to go and drew clear under a drive finishing under a vigorous hand ride to the wire. MY DELICIOUS
away well, led briefly before knocking heads briefly for the front, than chased along the inside coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, angled out
three to four wide into upper stretch in behind a pair of rivals and improved position to secure the place honors. DESPEIGHT ALL ODDS bumped at the
start by BASTET, who broke outwards, chased three wide before advancing tucked to the two path into the turn to prompt the pace between foes coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MATOULA broke in at the start and came
under hustling, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and offered no response.
ARTYISTHEPARTY brushed the near side stall at the start and came under hustling to establish the front after a brief tussle with MY DELICIOUS, showed
the way lightly coaxed in the two path, tucked inside half a mile from home and came under increasing pressure from a pair, yielded the front inside the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. ODEMGOLDENSLIPPERS chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch, faltered and was eased to the finish. Please note that ODEMGOLDENSLIPPERS wore a mask.

clear under a drive to prevail. SHE'S AN ALPHA established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half
a mile from home and came under increasing pressure, yielded the front near the quarter pole, proved no match for the top one while running on to just

GREAT WORKOUT six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five
wide for home, dug in under a drive to get up in the last jumps and prevail. BAR FOURTEEN showed the way in hand just off the inside, got set down
spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive coming out under a near sided stick and a taut off side rein to force NEMO'S FORTUNE to alter
course a sixteenth out, then got nailed in the final strides. NEMO'S FORTUNE bumped at the start by ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE, who broke outwards, then
got checked sharply as BAR FOURTEEN veered directly in front, lost two lengths of ground and position, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a
mile from home, took the inside route into upper stretch, angled out to rally between foes and was forced to alter course a sixteenth from home as BAR
FOURTEEN came out from his inside and ran on the finish to secure the show honors while well clear of the rest. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE broke out at the
start bumping NEMO'S FORTUNE, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened in the late
stages. VIKING ZIM hustled from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, cornered just off the inside for home and
weakened. TICKET TO ANTIGUA five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry as well as a jockey's objection by the rider of NEMO'S FORTUNE alleging
interference against BAR FOURTEEN. After review, BAR FOURTEEN was disqualified from second and placed third having been deemed to have
interfered with NEMO'S FORTUNE before the race was declared official.

SEARCH RESULTS forwardly placed from the start, went three wide through the opening bend under a rating hold attending the leader from the outside,
raced three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and through the far turn advancing to take command under mostly her own power
five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch in command, got roused at the three-sixteenths taking to near the inside, edged clear under
a light drive, had the right peek back and was geared down through the final sixteenth to the finish the outcome in no doubt. MARACUJA coaxed from the
gate, raced just off the inside through the first turn before tipping four paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the far turn placed to
coaxing three furlongs out, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to close in securing the place honors clear of the rest. ARMY WIFE
coaxed from the gate, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, had ALWAYZ LATE tip out
near the three-sixteenths directly in front and was checked off that rival's heels and THE GRASS IS BLUE, altered out inside that station and showed good
courage to regain some momentum and offer up a mild bid to procure the show honors. THE GRASS IS BLUE three wide through the first turn, chased four
wide under a ride from the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch and weakened. ALWAYZ LATE established the front shortly after the start
and showed the way in hand two to three wide, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and yielded the front at that station, swung two to three wide for
home, tipped out near the three-sixteenths when weakening forcing ARMY WIFE to check off her heels at that station and tired through to the finish. MIA
MARTINA saved ground through the first turn at the tail of the field, came under light coaxing and advanced down the backstretch into brief contention
nearing the half mile pole, continued along the inside through the far turn and began to retreat, angled out at the top of the stretch, tired and was eased to
the finish.

BOURBONIC saved ground at the tail of the field growing detached from the main body while loping along at his own pace, tipped off the inside nearing the
nine-sixteenths to the three or four path and continued three to four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, angled four
to five wide into upper stretch, closed well through the final furlong issuing a challenge through the final sixteenth and was just up in the last jumps to the
wire to score. DYNAMIC ONE four then three wide through the first turn, settled six than five paths off the rail down the backstretch in mid pack, went five
wide through the far turn advancing steadily under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the
eighth pole, dug in under a drive under late threat and was nailed in the shadow of the wire. CROWDED TRADE just off the inside through the opening bend
settled near the rear of the field, tipped to the five path down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the
three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. WEYBURN reluctant to load prior to the start,
raced three wide through the first turn in closest aim of the leader, attended that rival to the outside five paths off the rail down the backstretch before tucking
three wide through the far turn, remained patiently handled steadily whittling away at the leader to take command nearing the quarter pole, got set down
three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared near the eighth pole, fought on inside to the sixteenth marker, then got outfinished in the
late stages. BROOKLYN STRONG broke out at the start under coaxing and was corrected, tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack coming under
coaxing three furlongs from home, cut the corner into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. PREVALENCE away well, raced just off the inside through the
first turn ending up behind the cover of the leader, tracked the pace three to four wide down the backstretch just off the pace, tucked to the two path half a
mile from home, came under coaxing just past the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch still behind rivals, gained clearance near the
eighth pole and weakened to the finish. RISK TAKING bobbled at the start, chased two to three wide in pursuit from midpack in and behind rivals, came
under coaxing tipped four wide at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MARKET MAVEN hustled from the gate,
established the front and went four then three wide into the first turn before establishing position in the two path, marshaled the field two to three wide down
the backstretch in hand, came under coaxing at the three-eighths as the pressure intensified, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the
inside for home and weakened. CANDY MAN ROCKET three wide through the first turn, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four
wide through the far turn and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
MICHAEL'S BAD BOY three then two wide through the first turn, tracked the pace three then four wide from mid pack, advanced through the far turn put to
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and drew clear under a drive to prevail. WICKED GRINCH saved ground through
the first turn at the tail of the field, tipped out four then five wide down the backstretch, tucked back to the two path three furlongs from home placed to
coaxing, angled out five wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to secure the place honors while never threatening the winner. LOULOVESTHERIVER
saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid.
VOLIERO chased two to three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and kept on to secure the last major share. EIGHT
WEEKS LONG two to three wide near the rear of the field, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside
route into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly through the stretch to pass tired rivals. ALITE showed the way in hand along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, got collared near the three-sixteenths and weakened in the late stages. WICKED
KARMA chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. WAR OF THRONES tracked
the pace along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. YOU'VE GOT
MALE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside for home and tired. MOON'S EDGE three wide through
the first turn, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went four wide for home and made no impact. RUMDUM BYDA SEA broke
a half a beat slow, chased two to three wide coaxed along from three furlongs out, swung three to four wide for home and tired.
