Footnotes
MISS GHISLAINE raced off the early pace three wide, cruised up in hand three wide down the backstretch, drew clear nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
angled in and widened under moderate urging. BELLE'S KINGDOM was in range inside, went three wide around the far turn, could not threaten the winner
but outfinished foes for the place. TAMI'S ORCHID stalked the pace three wide, could not match strides with the winner around the turn, battled on for the
minor awards and held third. SAINTE MERE EGLISE saved ground in midpack, angled three wide near the quarter pole and never threatened. LEARNT
failed to menace while racing two and three wide. PRINCESS MERIDA chased the pace two wide, went four wide around the far turn and faded. KAMALA
dueled two wide and retreated in the lane. DISPENSE dueled inside and faltered nearing the lane.

Footnotes
HERCULES prompted the pace outside AMPERSAND for a half-mile, challenged for command between that one and SOSOSUBTLE coming to the
quarter-pole and poked a head in front, battled outside AMPERSAND through the stretch and narrowly prevailed. AMPERSAND hustled to the early lead
slightly off the rail, fought back when faced with two challengers around the turn, dug in stubbornly inside HERCULES through a long drive and yielded
grudgingly. SOSOSUBTLE had his hind bumped by SEAZAN a stride from the gate, ranged up in the four-path to loom a threat outside the leaders
approaching the stretch, but could not sustain the bid. SEAZAN broke awkwardly and bumped SOSOSUBTLE coming out, moved out four wide late on the
turn, and lacked a closing response on his left lead. CHIPSHAPE tired after six furlongs, then lugged in dropping far back through the final furlong.

Footnotes
GREY STREAK settled well off the pace inside, went two wide around the far turn, angled four wide in upper stretch, split rivals nearing the eighth pole,
kicked in leaving that marker and was up and clear late. ALONZO MOSELY prompted the pace two wide, reached even terms between foes near the
three-eighths pole, dueled inside around the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and led until deep stretch. JEALOUS EYES raced three wide in midpack,
made progress three deep rounding the far turn and evened out in the lane. MOONSHINE NOW steadied entering the first turn, raced in range two and
three wide and was one-paced in the lane. FARM STRONG raced off the pace two wide, went four wide around the far turn and improved position widest in
the lane. FEAR THE DEER was in range inside and lacked closing bid. MUTAKAAMIL stalked the pace three wide, reached even terms near the
three-eighths pole, dueled two wide around the turn and weakened in the lane. NAVAJO CREED threw his head at the start, saved ground and made little
impact. FLEX played no factor while racing two wide. SLEEPER RYAN S set the pace along the rail and stopped around the far turn. THE RUN-UP WAS
UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ENANO ASTRAY lost his footing and broke out, quickly recovered to a forward position, took over outside HAPPY CHAMP after five furlongs, drew clear in
the five-path turning for home, and kept MR TITO'S at bay through the lane. MR TITO'S advanced outside around the turn, had aim outside ENANO
ASTRAY in the six-path leaving the three-sixteenths, but could not cut into the margin while best of the others. RANGER UP put in a mild run on the turn
while shifting out four wide, could not gain through the last eighth of a mile but was well ahead of the remainder. HAPPY CHAMP vied inside BACH early,
was no match for ENANO ASTRAY late on the turn, and folded up. PERUVIAN DANCER got floated out a bit by ENANO ASTRAY at the start, and faded
around the turn two to three wide. BACH contested the pace outside HAPPY CHAMP for a half-mile, and gave way on the turn. QUICK STEP ED stayed in
range early inside, and stopped before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
BUXOM BEAST set the pace along the rail, drew clear nearing the lane, continued on the left lead through the stretch and held clear while ridden out.
WINNIPEG WONDER raced off the pace two wide, tipped out nearing the eighth pole and rallied between foes to gain the place. PRINCESS TERESKA
pressed the winner two wide and weakened in the lane. EMPEROR'S SONG was in range inside and lacked a rally. NEVE broke a bit awkwardly, checked
early, saved ground well, swung out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. FLAT OUT COOL chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane.
QUID PRO GLOW failed to menace while racing four wide. ODALEA broke in a tangle and made little impact while racing two wide. WATER WIZARD was
outrun while racing four and five wide. HASHTAG LUCKY had some early speed inside, checked entering the turn, angled three wide soon after and had no
further bids. BRYNBELLA played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
SOMETHING MAGICAL took control immediately, rated along inside to the far turn, was roused mildly to repel a bid from BEAN COUNTER through upper
stretch, and moved away hand urged. BEAN COUNTER tracked the pace three then two wide, was under a drive attempting to get past the winner after six
furlongs, got shaken off into the stretch and had enough to hold second. NYMUE'S TREASURE saved ground forwardly placed to the stretch, and lacked a
closing response. HOPONTHEBUSGUS raced in the two-path on the turns, and failed to menace. GENERIC MARK raced mostly three wide for six
furlongs, and made no progress widest through the lane. SAND DRIFT hugged the rail throughout, and offered little. DIXIE PRINCESS was slowest to
begin, and remained in arrears. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
GANGLY stalked the pace inside, angled two wide leaving the three-eighths pole, put a head in front approaching the quarter pole, drew clear in upper
stretch and held clear under confident handling. STAR JUANCHO raced off the pace three wide around the turn and finished willingly inside of foes.
NORTHERN chased the pace between foes and lacked a rally. MAN OF VISION was in range four wide between foes, dropped back a bit under a drive
nearing the lane and passed some tiring rivals in the lane. NICHOLAS ROSE made some progress five wide around the turn and faded in the lane.
MAJESTIC LUNA clipped heels early and made little impact while racing two wide. UNPUBLISHED set the pace along the rail and retreated through the
lane.

Footnotes
CHARLIECANDO went along in the three-path within range, bid between horses approaching the stretch, dueled late inside COACH PAUL and took a
narrow decision. COACH PAUL raced three to four wide in midpack early, joined the leaders approaching the stretch, had aim outside CHARLIECANDO
through the furlong grounds and just missed. MY COUSIN JOE was in some traffic midway on the far turn, shifted out four wide into the lane, and offered a
mild response to pick up the show. FORTY FLASH grabbed the lead with an alert start, showed the way near the inside to the far turn, got hooked into the
stretch and weakened. REINOANIMAUX got bumped by UNCUT GEM at the break and was slow to get going, went four wide around the first turn at the
back, put in a mild run coming off the far turn three wide, but did not have enough to threaten. MAYOR REMO pressed the pace outside for a half-mile, and
lacked the needed response. INACEPTABLE was strung out five wide on the first turn, moved up to force the pace outside into the backstretch, but
weakened on the far turn. OUTDOOR DINING was no factor inside. UNCUT GEM broke out bumping REINOANIMAUX at the start, and was outrun. GRAN
PATRON was never prominent. UNDER FIRE broke slowly and was always outrun. ARMALITE was four wide early, and retired after a half.
