Footnotes
MASTER PIECE (CHI) settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted off of the rail turning for home before swinging four wide entering the lane, offered a
good kick to rally outside of the leaders through midstretch, and edged past ADMIRALTY PIER in the late stages. ADMIRALTY PIER cleared off through the
lane for the first turn, held a clear margin around both turns while in hand and with his ears pricked, responded to coaxing passing the quarter pole to inch
away from chasing rivals, shifted outwards at the furlong grounds, met MASTER PIECE (CHI)'s bid passing that marker, but was bested in the late stages
by that foe. BANDUA stalked from the three to two path around the first turn, saved ground behind the leader around the far turn before shifting three wide
entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer foe in midstretch, chased from between rivals thereafter, and held show. TALK OR LISTEN (IRE) trailed,
took the far turn two to three wide before getting floated five wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally and failed to threaten. JAIS'S SOLITUDE stalked the
clear leader from the outside, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, chased to the late stages, then faded late.

Footnotes
RED GHOST stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail turning for home before tipping outside of the dueling leaders entering the lane, pursued WORA
through upper stretch before producing a bid at the furlong pole, and subsequently drove clear. WELLMAN trailed early on, gained two wide around the turn,
then sustained his advance along the rail through the lane to reach place approaching the wire. WORA pressed the pace four to three wide into the turn, bid
for the lead outside of THERIDEOFALIFETIME turning for home, forged an advantage while shifting to the four path passing the quarter pole, drew clear in
upper stretch with RED GHOST in pursuit, but was tested by that foe at the furlong pole, then bested by that rival a sixteenth out before losing place
approaching the wire. ETCHED IN STONE got caught four wide around the turn while midpack, shifted to the six path entering the lane, and stayed on for a
minor share. MEDICINE TAIL lied far off of the pace three wide, shifted ot the five path entering the lane, and failed to factor. SHACKLEFORD STRONG
prompted the pace three wide and from between horses, but failed to keep pace with those foes into the turn, and was done early. BE HERE set the pace
inside of a trio of pressing rivals early on, but faded inside of pair of rivals passing the three furlong pole, and continued to weaken thereafter. SUBSIDIZE
was outrun along the inside. THERIDEOFALIFETIME vied two wide and from between horses, forged an advantage at the three furlong pole while inside of
WORA, but was headed by that foe at the quarter pole, then caved while encountering mild shoulder taps from the rider, and was eased through the final
furlong.

Footnotes
GHOSTING KIM rated well off of the pace along the inside, came into the lane in the two path while chasing behind traffic, altered out five wide in midstretch
to commence a rally, offered a good kick and surged through the late stages, and got up a few strides before the wire. GIRL NAMED PATSY lied off of the
pace along the inside, shifted to the two path turning for home, split foes at the three sixteenths pole to commence her rally with many lengths to find, shifted
four wide at the furlong grounds, sustained her rally while hanging on her left lead, but was outkicked by an outer rival in the final sixteenth, then achieved
place on the wire. SENORA ROMA set the pace inside of a pressing LEXINTONIA while staying a path off of the rail through the turn, repelled that foe's bid
and another rival's rail challenge approaching the final sixteenth, but tired in the late stages, and was nailed a few strides out. NEVER FORGET hesitated at
the start lied far off of the pace three wide around the turn, shifted six wide entering the lane, and stayed on outside of tiring foes for a minor share. SISTER
OTOOLE trailed around the turn, shifted seven wide in upper stretch, and improved through the final furlong. SOUTHERN MAMA stalked along the inside,
attempted a bid along the rail through the lane, but failed to reach even terms before tiring in the final sixteenth. ZERO TO SIXTY took the turn in the two
path well off of the pace, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and passed tired foes. LEXINTONIA pressed the leader from the outside while kept in the three
path around the turn by that foe, but failed to reach even terms through the lane with that foe before weakening with a sixteenth to go. OLHO DE MEL lied
far off of the pace in the two path around the turn, and never got involved. DAWN'S DANCER tracked from midpack while caught four wide around the turn,
but hung on her left lead through the lane and weakened in midstretch. VERUCA lied forwardly placed three wide and from between horses, chased the
leaders through the turn while failing to keep pace, and continued to fade through the lane. JADES GELLY stalked two wide and from between horses, then
faded into the turn.

Footnotes
BONNY SOUTH tracked from midpack two wide, progressed three wide into the far turn to bid outside of GRACEFUL PRINCESS at the five sixteenths pole,
forged a narrow advantage in upper stretch as ROYAL FLAG inched closer along her outside, dueled between those foes through the final furlong, and
prevailed. ROYAL FLAG settled off of the pace along the inside, rallied four wide and outside of foes around the far turn to bid for the lead outside of a pair
of rivals in upper stretch, dueled with those foes through the final furlong, but was denied victory and achieved place. GRACEFUL PRINCESS set the pace
along the inside, showed the way from a bidding BONNY SOUTH around the far turn, dug in to resist that foe in upper stretch as ROYAL FLAG ranged up,
sustained the duel inside of those foes through the final furlong while battling on gamely, but was bested. ERES TU stalked along the inside, but was
outmoved by a pair of outer foes while failing to keep pace with the leader around the far turn, and chased them home without menacing. HIGH REGARD
trailed two wide around the first turn, saved ground off of the pace around the far turn, but failed to factor. SPEECH pressed the pace two wide, but came
under a drive into the far turn, failed to respond and wilted through the field at the three furlong pole, then was eased through the lane, jogged across the
wire, then walked off.

Footnotes
SCARLET FUSION broke inwards, stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the dueling leaders entering the lane, rallied to range up outside of RUSTLER
inside the furlong pole, and wore that foe down with a sixteenth to go. RUSTLER set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a vying MUBTADAA
around the far turn, scooted clear of that foe at the three sixteenths pole, but was worn down a sixteenth out. MUBTADAA stalked two wide, pressed down
the backstretch, vied around the far turn, but was repelled by her inner rival in upper stretch, and weakened late. ALPHA PREDATOR tracked from midpack
three wide, chased off of the leaders' flanks around the far turn, but was outkicked by an inner foe in upper stretch, then stayed on late. PRINCE MAIOR
broke a step slowly and shied from an outer foe into an inner foe at the start, lied off of the pace along the inside, swung to the five path turning for home,
but lacked a rally. BEOCCA broke outwardly and a step slowly, lied at the rear of the field two wide, pulled into the backstretch, attempted a five wide rally
around the far turn, but failed to do so, and played no factor. UNCLE DUKE was off a step slow and bumped by an outer rival at the start, lied at the rear of
the field three to four wide, and was outrun.
