Footnotes
PADDY'S PRINCESS was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with complete
authority. CLASSY BUT SASSY tracked the winner from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, failed to gain on that rival in the drive but was clearly
second best. LILY CHASER pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. LADY TIZMO was forwardly placed
early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole, and lacked the needed closing response. MY SUPER SALLY
was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, failed to be a factor and was reported by the stewards to have bled. SOUTHERN GALAXY
lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, did not threaten and was reported by the stewards to have bled. TRIVATI showed no early speed, raced
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HE'S ORIENTATE stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up in tandem with BAKENEKO to offer a bid with a furlong to run, vied with that rival
and proved best in a hard drive. BAKENEKO settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, offered a bid with the winner in mid-stretch, vied
with that foe and just missed. UNCOMMON VALOR checked from between foes nearing the half, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the
turn, angled out with a furlong to run and finished with good late energy. SEBASTIAN lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further
in mid-stretch and finished evenly. MR. MIMS dueled for the lead with GOLDEN G while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. GOLDEN
G disputed the pace with MR. MIMS from the inside and weakened after going five-eighths. SURFING broke outward, showed no early speed, raced
five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

BELFOUR was away alertly to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and drew off through the lane with complete
authority. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and could not match strides with that rival in the drive.
UNEQUIVOCAL lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with a late bid. IN HIM WITH HIM settled off the
leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn and lacked the needed late response. FAST MASTER settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly late. ALWAYS FORGIVEN was bumped at the start, showed no early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and did not menace. LUCKY JUNIOR showed brief speed and weakened. INVEST was off
slow and bumped, rushed to contend, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. MO ZONE lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DINOSAUR BEN stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up nicely three deep on the turn, swept to command turning for home and drew off while
kept to his business. BERNIE'S ON FIRE , a forward factor two wide down the backstretch and around the turn, bid for the lead entering the stretch, was no
match for the winner in the drive but remained clear of the others. FAST CASH , in the two path between horses around the turn, swung four wide in upper
stretch and lacked a serious rally. SIR BACK IN BLACK had a mild, three wide move entering the stretch then weakened in the drive. BOUNCING AROUND
, along the inner rail on the turn, eased out to the two path turning for home and failed to menace. ROMANOFF sprinted to the early lead, hugged the inner
rail and faltered in upper stretch.
