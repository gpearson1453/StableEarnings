Footnotes
PRINCIPLED STAND (GB) strolled to the front, was well rated while setting the pace through glacial fractions, controlled the tempo in the two path through
the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole then came under a strong hand ride, was put to a left-handed crop at the furlong marker and was
fully extended to last under a continued left-handed crop. RED STORM RISEN was taken in hand early then rated under a tight hold, went three wide while
in hand behind a foe early on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths then shifted four wide, pursued the winner under the crop in the stretch, gained
on that foe late and just missed while clear for the place. SO HIGH (GB) was taken in hand early then rated under a vigorous hold, went three wide on the
turn, was roused around the five-sixteenths then came under a drive into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. AASR was
taken under a hold early, stalked the pace on the inside of the leader, was asked while inside to the two path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and
came up empty. AMERICAN RULE was taken in hand early then reserved off the pace, moved from the inside to the two path on the turn, was given his cue
at the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. FAME TO FAMOUS was reserved on the outside, came under urging near the three-eighths, went four wide on
the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
ALWAYS SUNSHINE went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace in the two path on an uncontested lead, controlled the action in the two path
through the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, came under a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker and proved much the best under
steady urging. SQUARE SHOOTER settled nicely while just off the pace on the outside, came under coaxing in the three path on the turn, was roused for
more at the five-sixteenths, chased the winner under the crop into the stretch and proved no match while well clear for the place. CLENCH brushed with a
foe at the start, tracked the pace down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was asked with three furlongs to run and came up empty while best of the
rest. THE SICARII dropped back under some urging early then settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn and failed to respond. ZEALOUS was
coaxed along at the back, went three wide under urging on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and also failed to respond. FED FUNDS settled on the
outside, was urged four wide on the turn, passed the three-eighths under the crop and faltered. PROMO CODE broke out then brushed with an opponent,
settled on the inside, saved ground under urging on the turn and also faltered.

Footnotes
MAXWELL ESQUIRE settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, tucked inside through the turn and was patiently handled, had to briefly be taken in
hand when FAST GETAWAY shied and propped nearing the five-sixteenths directly in front, angled out three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive,
offered up a good kick to charge home getting up in the final jumps to prevail. QUARKY bobbled at the break, prompted the leader along the inside, cut the
corner into upper stretch taking over command, spied wind driven debris along the inside nearing the eighth pole and altered out two paths, dug in under
threat from a pair and was caught in the final strides to the finish. BATTLE STATION just off the pace four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked
to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on
threatening altered out in concert with QUARKY due to the blowing object, was shaken off inside the final sixteenth when weakening in the very late stages.
SMOOTH B brushed the near side stall at the start, chased two to three wide patiently handled until roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch,
weakened in the drive. ARISTOCRATIC showed the way in hand four paths off the inside under pressure from QUARKY to his inside, tucked to the two path
through the turn and came under light coaxing nearing the quarter pole, got displaced from the front and took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.
FAST GETAWAY tracked the pace just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn, was moving comfortably when suddenly shied and propped near the
five-sixteenths and was taken hold of and guided outside, forcing MAXWELL ESQUIRE to be taken briefly in hand in behind, angled out at the quarter pole
and propped once more ducking a bit inwards and tossing the rider from the saddle, then did so sans rider near the three-sixteenths and was apprehended
by outrider and walked off. There was a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the incident with FAST GETAWAY before the result stood and the race was declared
official.

HIGHER TRUTH (IRE) was taken under a hold on the initial straightaway, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer with a
half-mile to run, stalked three wide on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, gained to make a bid between horses in upper stretch, took the
advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. LISHEEN saved ground on the first turn, settled comfortably off the pace, moved
closer with a half-mile to run, went two then three wide on the final turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, closed fast to make a bid on the outside at the
three-sixteenths, took a short lead near the furlong marker, lost the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with that foe to the wire but
missed while able to get the place. COALITION BUILDING went around the first turn in the three path, was rated while tracking the pace on the outside,
engaged the leader on the far turn, took the advantage before the five-sixteenths, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch,
lost the lead near the furlong marker and was outfinished while well clear for the show. COMMUNITY ADJUSTED was well placed just off the pace on the
inside, saved ground through the far turn, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. SPATIAL moved in on the long
run into the first turn, tucked into the two path on that bend, settled on the outside while near the middle of the field, moved closer around the half-mile pole,
rounded the far turn in the two path, was roused at the five-sixteenths and came up empty. CEANT went to the front, traveled around the first turn in the two
path, set the clear pace through sensible fractions, was challenged while inside on the far turn then lost the advantage prior to the five-sixteenths, dropped
back into the stretch and capitulated. FIRING CAROL was last to commence then taken in hand, went three wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace,
dropped back while inside on the final turn and showed little. IMPEACH ME saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, dropped well behind on the
backstretch and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
AUNT KAT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn patiently
handled, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch roused straightened away, drew off under a light drive and was geared down to finish in hand through
the final sixteenth prevailing comfortably on the wire. WHISPERING PINES broke out at the start and was corrected before any contact could be made with
SARATOGA AFFAIR, chased just off the inside from the tail of the field, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home
and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors while never threatening the top one. PLEASANT ORB chased
along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages while along for the show
honors. RUVIES IN TIME three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late
going. SARATOGA AFFAIR just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, got placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper
stretch and weakened. SHE'S A BLACK BELT four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
NEBO settled in the back half of the field, went four wide early on the turn, swerved six to seven wide to avoid the spill inside the five-sixteenths, rallied
outside into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead just inside the furlong marker then moved clear late under good handling. MAZAL EIGHTEEN settled
just off the pace on the outside, went four wide on the turn, brushed with a foe at the five-sixteenths, rallied five wide into the stretch, took the lead around
the three-sixteenths then drifted out before being straightened by the rider, was headed by the winner just inside the furlong marker, fought with that foe until
near the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for the place. MONDEUSE stalked the pace on the outside, jostled with a foe near the
nine-sixteenths, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied five then four wide on the turn, led past the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive into the final
furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. WISH FOR MAGIC was hustled from the start then bumped with a foe shortly thereafter, raced just off the
pace while between horses, jostled with a foe around the nine-sixteenths, went four then three wide while making a bid on the turn, had a foe clip her heels
at the five-sixteenths, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. TRICK THE UNIVERSE was asked to establish early position then rated just off the pace,
saved ground on the turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, drifted out outside the furlong marker and weakened. BELLAMY'SPARTYGIRL
broke out then bumped with a foe, was urged along near the back, checked to avoid the spill late on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch under urging
and was no factor. NEW YORK BANKER bumped with a foe just after the start, showed good speed and set the pace under some pressure, vied in the two
path early on the turn then dropped to the rail, was headed nearing the quarter-pole and gave way. LASS was slowest into stride, saved ground near the
back, checked badly to avoid the spill late on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and was eased but walked off. MADAME ROSE was hustled from the
start, settled under some urging, dropped to the rail on the turn, checked badly to avoid the spill late on that bend and was also eased but walked off.
SPORT MODEL was rated just off the pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, dropped from the three path to the two path on the turn, clipped heels at
the five-sixteenths then stumbled badly and unseated the rider. UNDETECTABLE was bumped at the start and forced out, settled off the pace, went three
wide on the turn, brushed with a foe at the five-sixteenths then collided with another foe who had clipped heels directly in front and fell but returned to his
feet before being subsequently walked off. SAILOR'S TREASURE was off slow then taken up, raced at the rear, collided with a fallen foe late on the turn
and fell but returned to his feet before also being subsequently walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE SPILL ON THE TURN, NO
CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH
