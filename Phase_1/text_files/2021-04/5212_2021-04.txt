moved up four wide at the three sixteenths pole but had no final winning bid. JUST BUBBA was off slowly, raced at the back of the pack early on, saved
ground throughout and never was a factor. A FLICKER OFSILVER vied for the early lead while racing two wide and gave way. COACH DAN was slow early
on, raced four wide in the lane and never was a factor.

Footnotes
RYDER ROCKET raced five wide around the first turn, settled towards the back of the pack in the early going, moved strongly around the far turn, raced
four wide at the three sixteenths pole and finished well to edge clear late under steady handling. HEPUTTHEACEINRACE stalked the pace, raced along the
inside throughout, dug in inside the eighth pole but couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish second best. ROSIE'S CITY BOY raced up close
early on, raced three wide in the drive and weakened a bit late. IM JUSTA BACHELOR tracked the leader from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a
mile. IMALITTLESILVER was slow early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. RICK'S RAIDER was quick to begin, was getting out
around the first turn, continued to race off the inside while attempting to get out down the backstretch, raced the six to seven wide into the upper stretch as
he attempted to get out throughout. HIGHLIGHT REEL broke awkwardly, saved ground and never threatened. NOT FADE AWAY raced far back and was
eased up on in the stretch. Not Fade Away walked off the track under his own power.

DIXIELAND CANDY stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, continued to save ground through the far turn into the upper stretch, raced well
off the inside deep stretch and was clear under strong handling. GOSPEL MARGIE stalked the early pace, moved up four wide nearing the eighth pole but
was no match for the winner. YOLONDA was slow early, saved ground throughout, improved position through the lane but had not enough. CLASSICAL
HOTTIE settled to the middle of the pack, raced five wide at the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. CALL OF LOVE was off slowly, saved
ground and never threatened. SHEZALITTLEHAZEY showed good early speed while racing two wide and tired readily. FLAT QUICK stalked early on and
failed to sustain a bid.

DAAHER'S SUCCESS was forwardly placed early on, raced in the three path through the lane and finished well to get up under strong handling. MAN U
was unhurried early, moved up to challenge the leader nearing the eighth pole while racing five wide but couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish
second best. NOW MIND YOU stalked the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. COVINGTON QUALITY
showed good speed from the inside and gave way. TACKSON was slow in the early stages, raced six wide at the three sixteenths pole and never was a
factor. SWAGATTACK raced far back and never threatened.

EUROEXIT was forced to check sharply midway around the first turn, stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, moved up four wide through
the lane and got up in a determined run under strong encouragement. OKIE UNION showed good early speed to set all the pace, raced just off the inside,
dug in late but couldn't hold off the winner late to be second best. FINAL BURBANK stalked the early pace, was forced five wide around the first turn, moved
up four deep at the three sixteenths pole and kept on willingly to the wire. KHOLA raced a bit rank early, moved up four wide through the lane and had no
final bid. SPIRIT OF SPOATIE showed good early speed while racing four deep down the backstretch, raced off the inside in the stretch and faded. CATCH
THIS STAR failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
DRAMACIDE stalked the early pace, moved up five wide through the stretch and finished well to edge clear late under strong handling. INTERNET
EXPRESS showed good early speed to set all the pace, raced off the inside in the stretch, dug in nearing the sixteenth pole but couldn't match strides with
the winner late to be second best. SMOOTH OPERATOR was unhurried early, made a rail bid around the far turn through the stretch to improve position but
had not enough for the top pair. RAINBOWS TREASURE was slow in the early stages, moved up six wide at the three sixteenths pole and showed late
interest. NATALIE'S BOY stalked the pace, raced five wide into the upper lane and had no late response. CONTINENTAL COWBOY was slow early, raced
four wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. CALEBS TIGER stalked the pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and weakened. SWAY BACK
WHEN was void of speed early, raced five deep in the lane and never threatened. SANDMAN'S LEGACY raced towards the inside throughout and never
was a serious factor. RUN FREE raced up close early on along the inside and tired the final quarter of a mile.
