Footnotes
MADY ROSE angled in to stalk the early leader two deep, took the lead past the nine sixteenths pole and maintained the edge through the backstretch,
gave up the nod toward the quarter pole but continued close at the rail through the far turn, recovered the advantage a furlong away and dug in under
determined handling to inch clear of JAMESTOWN ROAD, who raced inside early then angled three wide to stalk midway on the opening turn, challenged
toward the five sixteenths pole, took a slim lead approaching the quarter and contested the edge two deep on the far turn, and while headed at the eighth
pole, dug in gamely before relenting; reluctantly. MY EMMALLY saved ground off the pace, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far
turn then dueled through the stretch for third. NAJWA angled to the inside to set the early pace, was caught leaving the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase
through the backstretch but dropped back toward the five sixteenths pole and yielded third in the lane. KATALIMA settled off the rail the first turn, bid
nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response.

Footnotes
IN THE GOSPEL gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail then angled three wide into the lane and dug in under steady left hand
urging to get up the final strides. STRONG SAFETY maintained the edge over PRINCE LOUIS through the backstretch but was met nearing the quarter
pole and gave up the advantage midway on the turn, recovered the lead at the eighth pole and dug in determinedly to outmaneuver that one, while getting
nipped from the win the final stride, while the latter, engaged in close chase through the backstretch and drew to even terms nearing the quarter pole,
dueled to a slim brief lead midway on the turn, gave it back at the eighth pole but continued on gamely to the wire. CLASSY SMITTY chased, raced in the
four path of the turn and finished evenly. STERLING GLADIATOR gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and showed little more. EIGHT OF
DIAMONDS raced well back then rounded the turn in the three and four paths. IRON HENRY raced well back and raced near the rail on the turn. PER
RULING #23 FROM THE WEST VIRGINIA RACING COMMISSION, IN THE GOSPEL WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A

Footnotes
SCHLOSSER took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, was met past the seven sixteenths, recovered the
advantage leaving the five sixteenths, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, drew clear under steady handling toward the top of the stretch,
then taken in hand past the sixteenth pole. SUNMAN rated close toward the inside the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the
far turn and finished evenly. LASER LOOP rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid leaving
the seven sixteenths pole then dug in through the lane to take third later yards. THE WAYNE FACTOR settled off the earlier pace in the two and three
paths, bid nearing the quarter pole but lost ground on the far turn, entered the stretch in the seven path and passed a rival. FLY E DUBAI stalked off the rail
then closed to even terms leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead nearing the three eighths, was caught past the five sixteenths, contested the far
turn two deep but dropped back nearing the head of the lane and weakened the final furlong. DYNAFORM raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase

BI BI CARPE angled in to set the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, rounded the turn at the rail and was steadily encouraged through the
stretch. GRANDPA MUNSTER steadied at the seven sixteenths pole then resumed the chase past the pole, challenged into the turn but dropped back
entering the stretch and settled for second best. TRUTH SERUM chased outside, rounded the turn about the four path, dug in through the lane and got up
for third the final yards. I'D LIKE TO KNOW gave chase then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. FUDGE chased through the backstretch, angled to
the seven path on the turn and passed some rivals. JUST GO WITH IT gave chase then weakened in the three path of the turn. TANELEER chased toward
the outside, raced in the six path of the turn then weakened. THISISTHETIMETOWIN saved ground.

Footnotes
MISS MORGANTOWN raced with the pace down the backstretch and dueled to the lead two deep midway on the turn, then dug in under steady stretch
encouragement to inch clear of DYLADDIE the final yards, who was hustled along at the rail to take the lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole, gave
up the edge nearest the rail midway on the turn but dug in gamely to late stretch before reluctantly yielding. REAL APPEAL chased outside, rounded the
turn about the three path then dueled through the stretch for third. HANDSOME JOANIE pressured the early pace two deep while between horses, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the turn near the rail then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. SISTER JOANN steadied at the break then
picked up the chase leaving the chute, angled to the six and seven paths on the turn and ran evenly down the lane. WHISKEY TALKING chased, raced
near the rail on the turn, angled to the five path into the lane but showed little more. WOODSONG'S CASTLE saved ground on the turn. STONES ROAD
gave chase outside then weakened about the six path of the turn. REVEIRS MINUTE broke a step slow and raced well back.

turn, dueled to the front mid-stretch and drew clear later yards. SHAMELESS RISK stalked two deep then challenged nearing the three eighths pole,
contested at a close disadvantage through the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and took second from the fading ROCKET APPEAL in the final

under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, drew clear into the stretch but was caught flattening
stride mid-stretch. CAPE LOOKOUT came away awkwardly and made light contact with Rocket Appeal, rounded the first turn about the five path and raced
outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. K W CAPTAIN FLINT raced off the

Footnotes
TRUE CROSSING angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and dug in
under steady stretch handling to hold on well. BOUNDTOBEGOOD stalked from the two and three paths early on then picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, was steadily encouraged down the lane but couldn't improve significantly. CHARITABLE VISIT raced off the
pace in the three path the first turn then left the turn outside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the four path of the far turn and dug in down
the lane to take third later yards. AMEN CORNER saved ground off the early pace then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, came through the far turn
in the four path but flattened stride the final furlong. SUNBRIDLED raced off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, then weakened. FRANKEE MERCH rated close to the early pace inside, picked up the chase from the
three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. G MAN saved ground through the opening turn then faded through the backstretch.
