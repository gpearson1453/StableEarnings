VISUAL ARTIST stalked the pace while circling the turn three wide, bid for the lead outside horses in upper stretch and drove clear. MORE TWIRL , well
placed two wide around the turn, was taken to the four path near the eighth pole, remained on his left lead and rallied nicely. DISPUTED NOTION hugged
the inner rail around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and had a mild rally to finish in a dead heat for third. SO DIALED IN prompted the pace
two wide on the turn, challenged for the lead near the five sixteenths pole and finished willingly. START THE PARADE , in close quarters leaving the starting
gate, was fanned six deep entering the stretch and failed to rally while trying to get in. DISTANT THUNDER set a pressured pace along the inner rail and
weakened the final furlong.

CONFUSION BABY BOY broke sharply, prompted the pace two to three wide outside FIFTY SEVEN CHEVY, garnered a slim lead after a half mile, dug in
when confronted from his outside entering the lane, exchanged a brush near the three sixteenths, dueled under right handed rousing then edged away late.
KISSEDTHEGIRLS , four wide shadowing the leaders, bid to engage entering the stretch, battled in close proximity soon after, stayed on his left lead and
was out finished in the final seventy yards. IMAGINE WINNING saved ground off the early pace, was put to a strong ride mid turn, angled five wide pursuing
into the stretch but could only muster up a mild late response. NIC NIC BOOM , in a bit close at the break, raced outside a rival nearing the turn and failed to
respond. FIFTY SEVEN CHEVY was sent up to the inside of rivals early on and gained a short lead, set a pressured pace towards the rail, dueled leaving
the three eighths, failed to go on with the top pair past the three sixteenths then retreated.

HAD THE NOTION broke inward, was straightened and hard sent to take over after about a furlong, set the pace in the two path, wandered out a path or
two entering the lane, drifted out under left handed asking in mid stretch, was corrected and held firm under a drive. PROMENADE PRINCESS , brushed at
the break, settled off the pace and outside a rival, angled out near the five sixteenths, swung seven wide into the lane, moved up past the furlong grounds,
shifted in and continued on with good energy to gain the place in the final jumps. MILLIE CHILD rated forwardly towards the inside, edged up under
pressure in mid stretch, pursued past the sixteenth pole but lacked the needed finish. BEAN INDISCREET prompted the winner three wide, was floated out
some into the lane, gave willing pursuit past mid stretch, dropped in some and faded. SACRED LADY , hustled along three wide, angled out in the drive and
offered a mild response. LONG POINT BEACH had her head turned slightly as the gates opened and was away last, was guided towards the rail and put to
asking, moved up some past the five eighths, chased while remaining inside but came up empty late. ELOQUENT LADY , four wide stalking the pace,
drifted out under pressure into the lane and weakened.

out in upper stretch and weakened. MONEY FROMHEAVEN bumped with ELLANATION leaving the starting gate, was four wide leaving the turn and failed
to be a factor. ELLANATION bumped with MONEY FROMHEAVEN at the break, was four deep entering the turn and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MALIBU BEAUTY relaxed three wide stalking the pace three wide, bid three deep past the five sixteenths, responded when shaken up soon into the lane,
forged clear in mid stretch then held firm under a solid drive. LIV AND LET LIV , away well inside, checked repeatedly when being taken back off the leaders
through the opening quarter mile, finally settled leaving the far turn, tracked behind a trio mid turn, swung out five wide into the lane, advanced between foes
heading towards the sixteenth pole and finished well to gain the place. KEWPIE DOLL rated off the pace four wide, angled six wide into the lane, moved up
outside rivals leaving mid stretch then hung late. VANQUISHER broke slowly then ducked in, regrouped and settled nearing the rail, appeared to nearly
graze the inner rail around the far turn, eased out to be about three wide into the lane, dropped back in, steadied with some run near the sixteenth pole then
continued with interest. PRETTY LORI was nudged to the front , set a pressured pace towards the inside, had to deal with two challengers past the five
sixteenths, drifted out when ceding command soon into the lane, drifted back in and out then weakened. TRITONE GAL prompted the pace two wide,
applied more pressure past the three eighths, sparred between rivals into the lane then faded in the last eighth.

WHISKEY AND YOU stalked the leader off the inside, took closer order mid turn, came under pressure soon after, entered the lane about four wide, made a
grinding run under strong handling and got up between rivals. TORCH OF TRUTH settled off the pace and saved ground leaving the far turn, eased out and
raced three wide in upper stretch, closed between runners, drifted in very late bumping with PIANZI and got the place. CAREY TIMES pulled his way clear
early on, set the pace off the rail into the lane, came under a ride soon after, wandered outward near mid stretch and gave way grudigngly. PIANZI , off the
pace while saving ground, remained inside through the drive, closed inside rivals in deep stretch then was jostled just prior to the wire. W W SPRINGTIME ,
in close at the break, settled off the inside, made a mild wide run in upper stretch then came up empty.

BANDOLINI stalked the pace, advanced outside horses leaving the turn, took the lead entering the stretch, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and dug in
tenaciously. SING A VERSE lacked speed, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied nicely outside winner. AUDACIOUS QUALITY , shuffled back
leaving the backstretch, swung out, was under urging four deep entering the turn and faded in the drive. GATOR FIFTY TWO saved ground around the turn,
remained along the inner rail in the stretch, moved up to mid stretch and failed to sustain the bid. MARU'S RAVEN , three wide on the turn, was in hand
awaiting room leaving the turn then failed to rally. REDACTED REPORT , sent to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and gave way through the
stretch.
