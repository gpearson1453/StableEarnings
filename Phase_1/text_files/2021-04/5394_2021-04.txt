Footnotes
FRANKI D ORO tracked the pace four wide while never far back, rallied through the lane and continued determinedly to just hold late from HOBBS HOPE.
HOBBS HOPE stalked the pace four wide, rallied through the lane and closed late to narrowly miss. LIVELY SPELL made the pace on a short lead inside
rivals and was worn down through the lane. TRUE ALLEGIANCE prompted the pace from between rivals to the far turn and weakened into the lane. SHE'S
SO BOSSY followed the pace three wide, angled in going to the far turn but lacked a solid closing bid. MEMORIES GALORE failed to mount a rally three
and four wide. MISS REVEILLE was just off the early pace two wide and weakened. HALEYS HEIST reared to come away well behind the field and trailed.

Footnotes
ZYXYZ settled off the pace three wide, angled out through the far turn to rally five wide into the lane and closed well to be going clear late. DISTINCT
APPROVAL was on the pace inside rivals and could not contain the winner's late run while just holding the place. DIVA'S DIVA dropped back off the pace
four wide, rallied six wide into the lane and closed but came up short. MY DARLING SOFIA prompted the pace three and four wide, bid through the far turn
but was outfinished for position in the drive. TAYLOR'S BEAUTY stalked the pace four wide, bid through the far turn but could not hold position in the drive.
SHIVERHERTIMBERS saved ground and made a mild late run as the field bunched through midstretch. DISTINCT FLIRT saved ground just off the early
pace and weakened into the lane. T. P. RIGHT LANE prompted the pace between rivals to the far turn and weakened into the lane.

Footnotes
MAVALOUS MAVALOUS was on the pace outside CHIRON ECLIPSE early, was joined by TICKER into the far turn and headed nearing the lane then
rallied back to go clear through the final sixteenth. TICKER stalked the pace three wide to bid through the far turn and show in front turning for home but
could not sustain the run. OMAHASETGEAUX moved up four wide but could not threaten in the lane. CHIRON ECLIPSE contested the pace inside the
winner to the far turn and weakened. SPLITS N STRIKES moved up three and four wide going to the far turn but had no late rally. LAINE'S PEACH angled
three wide into the far turn but did not threaten. BELLA'S BLUFF saved ground and was not a factor. SWEET ECLIPSE chased the pace two and three wide
and tired. BRIGHT SPIRIT broke into the side of the gate, followed the pace three to four wide and tired.

Footnotes
FEISTY BIRD showed the most early speed to cross over and gain the lead out from the rail, kicked away from the field into the far turn then held safe
through the lane under steady handling. HALO JAX rallied three and four wide through the far turn to get nearest the winner and finished well but could not
run down the winner. DOUBLE ONE SHOT was carried out in the first turn as a rival got out, remained outside. SHATTERED DREAMS moved up four wide
in the far turn but lacked a solid closing rally. I C WELL was four and five wide in the first turn, angled in turning up the backstretch and did not threaten late.
MINCO HONEY saved ground and tired. HAS THE GLORY lunged at the break then got out over heels into the first turn and dropped back. BABE TRUTH
chased the winner three wide and tired. ALIMONY MAN gave way early and was eased to the wire.

PHLASH DRIVE was on the pace outside PICKELJUICE through the opening half mile, edged clear nearing the lane to shake off a bid from JUDGE ON
THE RUN then held safe the remainder. SUPER CHARLIE settled off the pace three wide and rallied through the lane to gain clear for the place. JUDGE
ON THE RUN move four wide to get nearest the winner in the far turn but weakened in the drive. NAME THE PRICE lunged into the side of the gate to get
away last, moved four wide and lacked a final closing run. PICKELJUICE contested the early lead inside the winner while out from the rail and weakened in
the drive. L B GOLD failed to mount a rally three wide. WANT TO BE COWBOY followed the pace in good position two or three wide and weakened. GO
GOLD failed to mount a bid racing inside. DEE'S LUCK was always back and went five wide in the far turn.

Footnotes
MR. MIKE stalked the leaders three wide in good position, bid into the far turn then held well in the lane and kept safe to the wire. DOBY checked between
rivals late in the first turn, ranged up three wide to bid in the far turn but could not handle the winner late. WARRIOR'S LULLABY settled back off the pace
three or four wide, fanned seven wide into the lane and closed but was too late. MONYDONTSPENITSELF ranged up four wide outside the leaders to bid in
the far turn but could not sustain the rally. DANCE DOCTOR moved three wide to make a mild bid in the far turn then went evenly in the lane. BUBBAS
DIXIE tucked inside through the first turn, moved up in the far turn but could not produce the needed late run. AWESOME EMMIT chased the early leaders
two to three wide and weakened. DANZ A REBEL was four and five wide through the first turn and lacked a final closing bid. DROP THE GLOVES was not
a threat. BLABIMIR moved off to a clear lead racing out from the rail and had nothing left in the final turn.
