Footnotes
BIG AL'S GAL broke out at the start bumping EMPRESS LUCIANA in tandem with TOURRISTA, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, advanced nearing the quarter pole and spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths, inched clear under
a drive kept to task. REMOANE coaxed from the gate, established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked to the rail at the
nine-sixteenths, came under pressure from CHARLOTTE WEBLEY to the outside three furlongs out, remained patiently handled knocking heads with that
rival through the latter portion of the turn and got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front with three-sixteenths remaining and
ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest. CHARLOTTE WEBLEY hustled from the start, chased three wide down the backstretch before
tucking to the two path into the turn and advancing on the leader to issue a challenge three furlongs out, got on near even terms under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch briefly between foes, had BIG AL'S GAL come inwards safely in front and tipped out a path nearing
the eighth pole and weakened. HEY IT'S TATI four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch
and tired. TOURRISTA broke in at the start bumping EMPRESS LUCIANA in concert with BIG AL'S GAL, chased four wide under coaxing from three
furlongs out, continued four wide for home and tired. EMPRESS LUCIANA got bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way, chased four to
five wide under a ride from midway on the turn, went five wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DURKIN'S CALL settled nicely off the pace, raced inside early on the turn, moved to the two path under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths then the three path
around the three-eighths, rallied under the crop into the stretch, closed well to make a bid outside the pacesetter into the final furlong, took the advantage
into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. BIG MOUNTAIN angled in while going to the front, showed the way on a clear lead into the strong
headwind, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner into the final furlong,
fought with that foe to the wire and missed while clear for the place. VICAR'S LEGEND broke a step slow, dropped well behind while showing no speed,
saved ground on the turn and improved position to get the show. SICILIA MIKE broke a bit slow, was urged along on the outside, moved from three to five
wide on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch under the crop and also improved position. FINANCIALSTABILITY settled on the inside of a foe, was
urged along in the two path on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out in the final furlong and lacked the needed response.
BLINDWILLIE MCTELL settled on the outside, was urged four then five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. DADDY KNOWS was hustled from the start,
chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back while three then four wide on the turn and also lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
Through a stout wind emanating from the west, MUSICAL HEART established the front and showed the way in hand three wide through the first turn before
settling just off the inside down the backstretch and into a comfortable rhythm, remained patiently handled safely in front and had the field take closer order
three furlongs from home, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in
under growing late threat holding well to the wire to prevail. AJAAWEED along the inside through the opening bend, raced three then two wide in pursuit
from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a good finish to close
stoutly through the final furlong latching on the aforementioned foe as he hit the finish. ROCKETRY just off the inside through the first turn, chased four then
three wide coming under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. ZOOMER
four wide through the first turn forwardly placed, went to the five path into the backstretch briefly chasing isolated between the leader and the main flight
before easing off to join the main body of the field, tucked three wide at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced, swung
five wide into upper stretch and weakened. IRISH CORK bobbled at the break, settled just off the inside through the first turn just off the pace, chased two to
three wide until tucked to the inside into the far turn, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to go, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. AIR
ATTACK three wide through the first turn, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the far turn under
coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered five wide into upper stretch, tired, and was eased through to the finish.

stalked on the outside while tugging hard at the bit, went three then four wide on the far turn, rallied to the lead into upper stretch, led under a drive into the

three-sixteenths and improved position while flattening out. HUMPDAY was keen under restraint while saving ground on the first turn then reserved off the
pace, saved ground on the far turn, moved out under a drive outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. RINGGOOD was taken up while
rank in the three path on the first turn then reserved off the pace, went two to three wide on the far turn, was roused while swinging five wide from behind

bend taking command nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under late threat and
held safe to the finish. KINKY SOX got bumped solidly at the start by HOLMDEL PARK, who broke outwards, tracked the pace along the inside from near
the rear patiently handled and briefly taken in hand off the heels of a rival half a mile from home, remained on hold until cutting the corner into upper stretch,
got roused straightened away and rallied up the rail until tipped out two paths a sixteenth from home, cut into the winner's margin willingly to the finish while
clear for the place honors. OUT FIRST broke a half a beat slow and had her lane taken over by MOANA'S TALE, chased just off the inside under coaxing
from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. HOLMDEL PARK broke out at the start bumping KINKY SOX
solidly and knocking that rival briefly askew, chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn, remained patiently handled until called upon
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. SHE'S AN ALPHA two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, improved position to the furlong ground before weakening in the late stages. MOANA'S TALE two to
three wide in pursuit in range of the front, got placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. VITANZA
chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, went two to three wide for home and weakened in the stretch. BIG TIME LADY ranged up
after the start to duel briefly with HONEY MONEY taking narrow command five furlongs from home before emerging with sole command into the turn, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under threat to the outside, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then
tired in the drive. HONEY MONEY showed the way from the start early on before briefly knocking heads with the aforementioned foe while three wide,
tucked to the two path through the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths beginning to back track, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired.

able to get the place. FETCHING settled on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, gained to make a bid outside the
furlong marker but was out-kicked while able to get the show. LEXINATOR pressed the pace while loosely between horses, drew even with the leader in the
two path on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. MAGICAL SOUL stalked the pace on the outside then in the four path on the
