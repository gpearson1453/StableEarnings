THEY SHOT SONNY lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, angled to the three path in upper stretch, rallied between horses, led late and drove
clear. NO MORE TALK stalked the pace, eased out to the three path approaching the stretch, led in upper stretch, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and
failed to hold off the winner. FIVE CARD DRAW hugged the inner rail, prompted the pace, challenged for the lead in upper stretch and weakened late.
FEDERALE circled the turn four deep and gave way. HIGHER PURPOSE set the pace well off the rail and tired the final furlong.

Footnotes
MAGIC MULE hugged the inner rail stalking the pace under a snug hold, swung outside in upper stretch, swept to command outside horses approaching the
sixteenth pole and eagerly drew out. DESHACKLED disputed the pace racing along the inner rail, failed to hold off the winner and lasted for the place.
HELLO AMIGO , four deep around the turn, had a mild rally. FLANK SPEED , bumped and forced out by MIRACLE BOBBIE leaving the starting gate,
disputed the pace outside DESHACKLED and gave way. WINSTON PEGG , bumped by FLANK SPEED when that one was forced out at the start, failed to
be a factor and raced five deep turning for home. GUISING , unhurried down the backstretch, was not a factor. ONE MORE FACTOR , along the inner rail
down the backstretch, was steadied when shuffled back entering the turn. STAR OF NORMANDY raced inside horses on the turn and was not a factor.
MIRACLE BOBBIE bore out leaving the starting gate bumping FLANK SPEED, chased the pace three wide on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
OUR HOISTED MAST , bumped by SWING YOUR SWORD leaving the starting gate, swung to the six path in upper stretch, closed steadily outside horses
and was up at the wire. NEW YORK ONE , in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace inside horses on the turn, angled outside in upper
stretch, was well placed in mid stretch and flattened out. STRETCH THE TRUTH sped to the early lead, set the pace near the rail and drifted out inside the
sixteenth pole. SO DIALED IN , two wide on the turn chasing the pace, moved up near the sixteenth pole and flattened out between rivals. SWING YOUR
SWORD bore out leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail in the stretch and offered a mild gain. SILVER SUN , in tight quarters leaving the
starting gate, raced three wide mid way on the turn and failed to rally. COHODES bore in and bumped NEW YORK ONE after stumbling at the start, saved
ground on the turn and gave way. COMMUNICATION FAIL bore out leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four wide, weakened and was eased.

the turn and lacked a rally. TRUE SHIPMAN chased the pace two wide and gave way. NOT TELLING , very wide entering the stretch, weakened. BOSS
LIFE , four wide entering the stretch, was vanned off after pulling up lame inside the eighth pole. ISABELLA'S MAGIC , outrun, pulled up inside the eighth

sixteenth pole and had a slight rally. MISS OLD BAY , two wide around the turn, chased the winner to mid stretch and weakened. FANCY PRINCESS ,
three wide turning for home, lacked a rally. PRINCESS ADIRA lacked speed, failed to be a factor and passed tired horses. DEVILISH AFFAIR , four wide on
the turn, was not a factor. SUPREME BLESSING , a forward factor along the inner rail, gave way entering the stretch.

Footnotes
EDIE MEENY MINY MO hopped at the break, speed to a two wide lead near the half mile pole, opened up entering the stretch and was kept to her business
in the drive. RESPONSE TIME , bumped at the break, steadied lacking room mid way on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied nicely.
DARE TO PROMISE , bumped at the break, raced four wide on the turn and rallied. SIZZLING HOT showed speed along the inner rail and faded.
DESPEIGHT ALL ODDS , three wide on the turn, chased the pace and gave way the final furlong. LIKELY CHOICE , three wide on the turn, failed to be a
factor. MISSION TRAIL bore in bumping ERICA JANE and forcing that one leaving the starting gate, raced forwardly in the two path and faltered. ERICA
JANE , bumped and forced in leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail around the turn, faltered and was eased.

OMATI prompted the pace two wide, gained the lead turning for home then impeded horses when drifting out near the eighth pole. AMERICAN FLEET
saved ground stalking the pace, eased out to the three path in upper stretch, had a seam between horses when rallying then took up and bore out into ONE
MORE CHAPTER when forced out by OMATI near the eighth pole. ONE MORE CHAPTER , patiently rated inside horses, swung wide in upper stretch and
was forced in mid stretch when soundly bumped then rallied gamely. JACK GAVE BACK lacked speed inside horses, carried out LOST MY VOWCHER
when swung wide in upper stretch then steadied when ONE MORE CHAPTER was forced out in mid stretch. ERIC'S EMPIRE broke sluggishly, failed to be
a factor and raced along the inner rail in the stretch. DEMO DOCTOR showed speed along the rail and gave way. LUXERO , wide the far turn, was not a
factor. TWITTY CITY gave way. LOST MY VOWCHER , wide both turns, was forced out in upper stretch, gave way and was eased. Following a stewards'
inquiry and objections by the riders of AMERICAN FLEET and ONE MORE CHAPTER, OMATI was disqualified and placed third. An objection by the rider
of ONE MORE CHAPTER against AMERICAN FLEET for alleged interference in mid stretch was not allowed. Objections by the rider of JACK GAVE BACK
aginst AMERICAN FLEET and ONE MORE CHAPTER for alleged interference in mid stretch were not allowed/.

DESBORDES set the pace along the rail, opened up in mid stretch then was kept to her business. SWEET HOME DIXIE , three wide the first turn, swung to
the five path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. JUDI BLUE EYES prompted the pace outside the winner, weakened and raced on her left lead late.
ONE LAST TRIAL lacked speed, raced between horses in the stretch and failed to rally. FAIRY WISH , swung wide turning for home, lacked the needed
rally. SKI BUNNY stumbled at the break, raced three wide on the turns and gave way.
