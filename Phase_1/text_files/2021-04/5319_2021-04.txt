Footnotes
APRIL FOG broke sharply to press the pace of SOLD ON SALSA while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
vied through a prolonged drive and proved best. SOLD ON SALSA was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when
challenged by the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with that rival and just missed in a game effort. OURHANDSOMEGAL lagged early, saved
ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good energy. HEATHER HILLS settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the
turn and finished evenly late. PAPA'S ISLA DOLL chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
RACE DAY SPEED was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and drew off through the
lane with complete authority. ROARING RIVER pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, could not match strides with that rival in the drive
but finished with good courage. ZAMAN tracked the pace of the winner from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch and failed to gain late. HE HAD
A SECRET lacked early speed, moved up five-wide to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way soon after. SECRET MAGICIAN was void of
early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. IRISH MAIL was off a step slow, lagged early and did not threaten. MR. HAND
FULL chased the leaders while racing four-wide for a half and weakened.

off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly late. O'HAIRE set a pressured pace
from off the rail and gave way through the final furlong. SHIPWRECK tracked the pace of 'OHAIRE from the inside and gave way in the drive. DIVINE

Footnotes
EXECUTIVE DECREE stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive, responded to steady urging and wore down
GETININTOMISCHIEF in the closing yards. GETTININTOMISCHIEF was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command nearing
the three-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin but could not resist the winner late. ELLAS MY LOVE lacked early foot, raced seven-wide through the turn
and finished with good late energy. STREET SHARK was bumped at the break, set a pressured pace from off the rail and gave way through the final
furlong. TARTAN THE BULL settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. WILD WINTER was off a step slow,
lagged early, saved ground through the turn, reached a contending position but did not gain late. UNCLE HAL was void of early speed, raced five-wide
through the turn and lacked the needed rally. SAVAGE MUSIC was bumped at the start, pressed the pace while racing four-wide for a half and weakened.

KITTEN WITH A WHIP settled off the leaders early, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with PRINCESS JAVONCIA
through a vigorous drive and edged clear through the final yards. PRINCESS JAVONCIA opened a clear lead soon after the start, responded when
challenged by the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive and gave way grudgingly late. DIXIELAND
DARLING appeared hard to rate, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good energy. LASTING JOY
showed brief speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. BROADWAY PEGGY raced off the pacesetters from the inside,
checked nearing the nine-sixteenths pole, moved three-wide through the second turn and gave way in the drive. BOASTFUL CONTESSA lacked early foot,
saved ground through the second turn, moved up for a contending position but failed to gain late. GET BACK HOME was taken back at the break, moved
six-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. TROPICAL FROSTY chased the leaders while racing three-wide for a half and weakened.

NATIVE HAWK was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew off. HARD
WEST raced unhurried early, angled in with a furlong to run, could not gain on the winner late but was clearly second best. FRIENDLY FELLA pressed the
pace of TIZ APPROVED while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive. TIZ APPROVED was
away in good order to set a pressured pace and gave way through the final furlong. WILL RUNAWAY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn,
angled out into the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BAHAMIAN MOON was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the half and drew off through
the lane as a handy winner. LA BELLA VITA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the
drive but finished well to be clearly second best. BRIGHT AND SHINY chased the winner from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch but failed to gain late.
BELLARIFIC pressed the pace of the winner from the inside and weakened after the opening quarter. OUR GIRL lacked early foot, saved ground through
the turn and did not menace. MYONGA raced off the pacesetters from the inside throughout and lacked the needed rally. SO MOXIE was off slow, lagged
early, raced five-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. CATCH THE RAINBOW hopped at the break, settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the turn and weakened in the drive. WICKED THONG was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
