Footnotes
EL BORRACHO settled at the rear of the field early, continued to run at the rear through the backstretch run and second turn, came four wide on the turn
while still at the back, found clear running room and mounted a late rally in the stretch to catch STACKIN SILVER in the final stages. STACKIN SILVER was
hustled early to set fractions, maintained a two wide running position through the backstretch and onto the second turn, was set down for the drive in the
stretch and was caught late by EL BORRACHO while besting the rest of the field. KALINE was allowed to settle toward the back of the field early, continued
to run at the back while three wide on the second turn, and put in a late rally to secure third. TORO DE TORO hopped at the start, then chased the early
pace, was three wide on the second turn while close up, was outrun off of the turn, and tired in the stretch. MAXINAMILLION was fanned three wide on the
first turn, then moved up to stalk the pace, continued to be close through the backstretch, came two wide along the turn while stalking the pace, was outrun
into the stretch and weakened late. MY SUNSHINE chased the early pace, gained position along the backstretch, was outrun on the turn while saving
ground and was empty for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
JIMMY IRISH flashed good speed in his debut, dueled outside of HANDR'SDREAM and three wide, pushed away from that one to mid stretch and held
driving. LESSONS OF AUTISM had no speed, was two wide to the stretch then finished with interest through traffic. HANDR'SDREAM contested the pace
inside the winner while off the rail to the stretch then could not keep up to mid stretch and weakened. SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS was chasing three wide to
the stretch then lacked a closing response. SAWASDEE stalked the leaders from the two path to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and tired. EL
CHARRO CHAMP had no speed, raced in the back of the pace two wide to the stretch then did not threaten in the drive. SPEEDY TOM also had no speed
and saved ground but was not a factor in the lane. MAMACALLMEBOO was chasing to the turn, raced three wide while being outrun to the stretch then
gave way. LONGFORD broke slow and was always outrun.

Footnotes
RIGHTEOUSLY was outsprinted to the turn while in the two path, swung out for room and was four wide into the stretch, rallied when set down and
gradually wore down the leader. MAGGIE'S MAGIC set the pace two wide to the stretch, edged clear to mid stretch then dug in but lugged out leaving mid
stretch and could not stall the winner. GARDEN IN THE SKY was stalking early, saved ground to the stretch, was outrun to mid stretch and lacked a closing
response. WILDLY DRAMATIC also stalked the pace outside rivals, was four wide to the stretch then also did not rally. MARK WHATS MINE had no speed,
trailed two wide to the stretch and did not threaten. GOOD TIME DOLLY was outrun to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch and lacked a closing
response. OSCAR NOD pressed the pace early, offered a bid three wide to the stretch but gave way through the drive.

Footnotes
VEGAS PALM was allowed to settle early, saving ground through the backstretch and the second turn while stalking the pace, slipped to the rail for the
stretch drive, dueled LEMON DROP TINI to the wire and just nipped that rival for the win. LEMON DROP TINI set the early fractions from a ground saving
trip, continued to save ground through the backstretch and second turn, was headed by two other rivals into the turn, shook free of those then battled
VEGAS PALM in the final sixteenth and could not get past, while still an easy second. QUICK AND DIRTY stalked the early pacesetter from a two wide
running position, was always close up while two wide through the backstretch and on the second turn, lost position coming into the stretch but was kept to
task and was an easy third. OH LADY OH was three wide on the first turn while chasing the early pace, continued to chase the pace while wide on the
backstretch and the second turn, was outrun into the stretch and could not mount a late rally. LAKAYA settled toward the back of the field through the early
stages, improved position along the second turn while two wide but could not continue that bid and was not a factor late. SUMMER APPARITION was
unhurried through the early stages, settling at the back of the field while saving ground, was outrun on the turn and had no late response. FLOWER STAR
settled in the midpack through the first quarter, lost position along the backstretch while four wide, continued to be wide along the second turn and was
empty in the stretch drive.
