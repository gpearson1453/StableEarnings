MUCHO PROSPECT broke well and set the pace under pressure early, shook clear on the turn then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the
best. JUNIOR GILLIAM never far back, had a mild late rally and finished second best. TOM T WHO hopped at the start, rushed to contention on the inside
then faded in the stretch. BAR STOOL BUDGET failed to menace. LOVEATTURKEYCLUB was no threat. MAJOR PERFECTION had brief speed. TEMPLE
MOUNT pressed the early pace from the inside and was through after a half.

Footnotes
SAY HEY KID prompted the pace two wide into the far turn, drew on even terms for the lead, matched strides the length of the stretch, dug in gamely and
got up in time by the narrowest of margins. THIRTYSILVERPIECES broke in front, set all the pace while getting slow fractions and just missed hanging on.
ESCALERA trailed into the stretch, swung wide and closed determinedly in the middle of the racetrack. SLICK AS ICE vied for the lead three wide, loomed
boldly nearing the quarter pole then failed to sustain that bid. TACTICAL QUALITY failed to respond. FRENCH ACCENT was a forward factor into the
stretch then faded. WICKETS WAY moved closer before a half then came up empty.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA MARTINI broke well and made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and won as much the best under a hand ride. AXIS trailed down
the backstretch, closed willingly in the five path through the stretch and finished clear for second. ONLY ONE WAY BACK chased the winner and was
outfinished for second in the four path. FED XMAN close up, swung wide and finished evenly. PRINCE AMADEUS was no factor. TESTIFIED close up
along the inside, lacked room entering the turn then dropped back. INTO MAGARAYQUAZA broke in front, chased the pace three wide and was through
after a half. SHACKLEFORD DANCER was through early.
