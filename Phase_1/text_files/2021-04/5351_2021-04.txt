Footnotes
WARRIORS HERO was off a step slow and checked, raced unhurried early, moved up from the inside to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened
a clear margin into the lane and held off the re-surging JJ'S CROWN to prevail. J J'S CROWN was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing
three-wide, relinquished that position to the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled out in mid-stretch and was gaining on that foe late. RIDE FOR
GLORY broke out, raced four-wide through the first turn, raced just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the
drive. FULL VELOCITY pressed the pace of J J'S CROWN while racing four-wide, angled in with a furlong to run and failed to gain late.

Footnotes
JOE JACKSON pressed the pace while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive, offered a bid with a sixteenth to run and proved best in a
stiff drive. CREATIVE ART dueled for the lead from between foes, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the sixteenth marker, vied and just
missed with a game effort. VIVID FEVER was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid.
TRES CHIFLADOS disputed the pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. MERCY RULE showed no early speed, raced four-wide
through the turn and found her best stride late. RED CHARGER raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and lacked the needed
rally. EMPIRE KNIGHT was off slow, raced unhurried early and did not reach contention.

TICO TIME was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and was up in the closing yards to be going
away late. BODE'S BEST broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside with SOUTHSIDE CAROLINE, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a
clear margin into the stretch but could not resist the winner late. REDHAWK showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with good
late energy. SIZZLING GRACE was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. SOUTHSIDE
CAROLINE was away in good order to dispute the early fractions with BODE'S BEST while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half.
KEEPONROCKINMEBABY was off a step slow, pulled to contend, raced three-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. PARKERS BLACK LADY
showed brief speed, raced three-wide through the turn, weakened and was eased through the lane.

RACE HOME was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the half, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run and
held sway to the wire. BIG LEAGUE BENNY broke sharply to chase the leaders from the inside, dropped back nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, moved
three-wide through the turn, raced between foes through the final yards and finished with good courage to re-gain the place. ARIZONA MOON showed no
early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good late energy. MR PAYTIENCE was off slow, rushed
to contend, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way through the final sixteenth. DYNAMIC RULER was away in good order to set a

Footnotes
MY WAY OUT dueled for the lead with MATSON while racing four-wide, disposed of that rival after going three-quarters, opened a clear margin and drew
off through the lane with complete authority. ALBANY FRONT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, could not
gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. VICTORY LANE was never far back while racing from between foes, moved four-wide
through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. GOLD TREASURE raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. MATSON broke sharply to duel with the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after going six
furlongs. LINEMANS CHECK threw his head soon after the start, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and failed to offer a bid.
SHARPSHOOTINGEORGE lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and did not threaten. Due to a timer
malfunction the half mile time is unavailable.

MY FIRST PEARL stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, was carried out nearing the three-sixteenths pole, responded when set down for the drive,
reached the fore in the closing yards and drew clear. SMOOTH RITHMS settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with late
bid. NOVA STAR raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a steady rally.

GEMSTONE GAL raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a sixteenth to run, led and gave way late. TIZ TENACIOUS
chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened through the final sixteenth. PALACE STAR was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the
turn and did not threaten. COASTAL RUN bobbled at the start, recovered quickly to open a clear lead before going a quarter, raced off the rail while setting
the pace and weakened through the final sixteenth. DESERTROSE OFTEXAS raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. ELDORADO DREAM was off slow then allowed to settle, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to menace. APRILINTHEPINES was off a step
slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
