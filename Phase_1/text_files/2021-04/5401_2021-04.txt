turn, rallied while widest of the second flight through midstretch, up for the place while not a threat. CATECHISM forwardly placed while racing off the inside,
three wide into the lane, long drive for the place position, outfinished, well clear of the others. CREDIT ENHANCEMENT last to leave, trailed early, improved
position toward the inside, proved no real threat. SIMONA'S CHOICE back off the pace and the inside, two path into the lane, failed to muster a rally.

SPURWINK LANE broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch, headed nearing the furlong marker, battled back in game fashion to narrowly prevail.
SERIOUSLY SASSY settled off the pace off the pace and the inside, between rivals into the turn, angled out four wide into the lane, rallied for the place to
be getting to the winner late. ARKANSAS BLING forwardly placed on the outside, challenged and dueled through the turn, put a head in front into the
stretch, continued to duel past the furlong marker, faltered in the late going to lose the place. FANCY BLAZE last away, fell further back afterward, made a
bold move four out to five wide turning for home, flattened out in the final furlong. DENALI ROCKET broke alertly, pressed up the backstretch, fell back turn,
just off the inside, went evenly through the stretch. COURTNEY FAY within striking distance in the second flight while widest, five wide into the turn, four
wide exiting, chased the dueling leaders past the furlong marker, weakened late to lose a couple of positions. ELLA'S MY GIRL broke back, fell further back
to lag well back, two path into the lane, passed some tiring rivals while never a serious threat. FEMININE ALLURE in mid pack just off the inside into the
turn, traffic late in the bend, came up empty when clear for the drive. DAIGLE broke with the leaders, forwardly placed between rivals into the turn, began a
steady fade before a half. THIS GIRL DOES never a threat, stopped in the turn three wide, fell far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
EARNER broke on top, set the pace along the inside, shook off the other speed entering the stretch, pulled away. GOLDEN TIGER off a step slow while
being bothered slightly, moved up closer toward the inside, continued advance just off the rail into the lane, edged clear late for the place while not a threat
to the winner. K W CAPTAIN HOOK within striking distance, raced three wide through the turn, set down for the drive, lacked a serious closing response to
finished up best of the rest in lasting for the show. NASHVEGAS off slowly, raced well back, steered out to be six wide turning into the stretch, lodged a mild
rally down the middle of the strip to improve position, not enough late for the show. IMPUNITY off a bit slow, lacked speed, dropped inside turn, also
improved position a bit while not a serious threat. SOLDIER BOY in the second flight along the outside into the turn, five wide early in the bend, four wide
exiting, went evenly through the stretch. MISTER OAKLEY back off the pace and the inside, failed to muster a rally. MIRACLE HILL broke in, pressed the
pace for a half, gave way for the drive. DREW was four wide through the turn, finished before a half.

Footnotes
GREELEY AND BEN broke in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, shook clear when straightened for home, enough left to hold off the runner
up late. SEVIER broke alertly, alternated up front outside the winner, fell back off that one entering the stretch, coming back to try that one again, too late.
STORMIN HONGKONG in the second flight inside, continued to save ground through the turn, up for the show late while continuing inside. STROLLING in
the second flight early outside, four wide through the turn, closer upper stretch, flattened out to lose the show in the late going. ORO DE TEJANO last away,
trailed for a half, three wide, trailed for a half, passed some faltering rivals while never a threat. I BELONG TO BECKY off the pace and the inside, came up
empty for the drive. SOMETHING SUPER remained always back in a dull effort. JACK VAN BERG forwardly placed for a half, backed up through the
stretch.

Footnotes
FIREHORN behind the early pace inside, steered out to be three wide into the lane, bid between horses nearing the furlong marker, put a head in front soon
after and proved narrowly best in the run to the wire in determined fashion. SHARP ART forwardly placed from the start, dueled through the turn, took over
turning into the stretch, gave ground grudgingly to the winner the final furlong. CARDIAC KITTEN settled off the pace and the inside, came four wide into the
lane, bid midstretch, outkicked in the late going. FIVE O ONE last away, saved ground when well back, continued inside through the turn, moved out,
showed some belated interest to improve position a bit. WASABI MOON settled in mid pack, lacked a closing response. NIALL four wide trip, failed to
menace while remaining out in the strip. HOOF PRINCE broke well, dueled up front inside the runner up for a half, gave way in the drive. LOUDEN'S GRAY
off the pace out in the strip, shortened stride into the turn, pulled up in apparent distress, vanned off.

Footnotes
BEST KEPT SECRET asked away from the gate, showed the way through the first turn, rated kindly in the run up the backstretch, continued to race in hand
second turn, enough left in the drive to hold the runner up at bay. BLESSED AGAIN back off the early pace three wide, unhurried in the run up the
backstretch, moved closer in the three path final turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker then could do little with the winner late, remained clear for
the second spot. BEACH FLOWER in the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground off the pace in the run up the backstretch, rail into the
lane finished up best of the rest without mustering a serious closing response. FIGURE IT OUT pressed the winner while outside that one for six furlongs,
weakened in the drive. PIECE OF MY HEART prompted the pace while three wide through the first bend, remained in a forward position the middle half mile
outside, four wide turn, came up empty for the drive. LA RENOLETA (ARG) last to leave, raced three wide in the second flight first turn, dropped inside
when continuing to trail second bend, failed to muster any kind of closing response in a dull effort.

Footnotes
LONG TERM THINKING forwardly placed from the start outside, ranged up three wide to challenge midway on the turn, narrowly showed the way into the
stretch, extended duel to the wire off the inside, proved best under firm handling. TENTH OF GOLD also forwardly placed from the start, bid between rivals
midway in the turn, dueled past the furlong marker closest to the inside, could not match strides with the victor late, clearly second best. AMONGST
FRIENDS off a step slow, settled back toward the inside, worked way out to be three wide into the stretch, rallied and finished willingly to be clear for the
show. FLASH OF PROMISE off step slow, behind the pace inside, boxed in late in the turn, asked when clear, went evenly to the wire. BLAKE B. off slowly,
lacked early foot just off the inside, remained in the two path through the turn, improved position a bit by passing a couple of tiring rivals, no real threat. ARE
YOU HAPPY broke sharp, sprinted clear to set the pace, showed the way into the turn, gave way when headed by the top two midway on the turn. OF THE
MOMENT fell back after the start to trail, continued to lag, made little impact in the drive. MY HONEY'S PERFECT raced off the pace and the inside, four
wide into the lane, faded through the stretch.

Footnotes
AMERICAN DUBAI broke well, dueled up front while closest to the inside, shook off the other speed midway the final turn, not threatened through the
stretch while being kept to pressure. BANKIT fell back after the start, remained unhurried in the run up the backstretch, steered out three wide turning for
home, ground out a rival from the outside through the stretch for the place, no threat to the winner. BEAVER HAT settled off the pace and the inside,
advanced to be closest to the winner out of the final turn, outkicked for the runner up position while also not a threat to the winner. TRUCULENT broke in
mid pack, fell back to trail, continued to lack speed, passed tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. ALL WEST went one paced throughout off the
inside, lacked a closing response in the drive. WARRIOR'S MAP within striking distance off the inside, continued three wide up the backstretch, began to
fade after five furlongs. HOME RUN TRICK broke on top, dueled off the inside, helped set some lively fractions early, gave way after five furlongs.

Footnotes
JAXON TRAVELER broke very alertly, narrowly set the pace toward the inside, shook clear late in the turn, maintained a daylight advantage through the
stretch under steady handling. CAZADERO broke back, settled outside, four out to five wide into the lane, rallied and proved determined for the place, not a
threat to the winner. BOB'S EDGE lacked speed off the inside, three wide through the turn, came four wide when splitting foes exiting the turn, set down for
the drive, mild interest, outkicked for the place, clear of the others. GAGETOWN broke back, four wide up the backstretch, steadied between rivals with a
half mile remaining, dropped inside through the turn, saved ground into the stretch, came up empty for the stretch run. SIR WELLINGTON vied up front
along the inside, chased the winner through the turn, had little left for the drive. SEA TO SUCCESS pressed the winner from off the inside, three wide into
the lane, faded in the run to the wire.

Footnotes
LIVINGMYBESTLIFE broke sharp, set the pace while off the inside, continued to hold a narrow advantage late, held the runner up at bay under firm
handling. H'RAYFORCABERNEIGH also broke well, pressed inside, fell back off the winner into the turn, stayed on while continuing to save ground through
the turn, trying to come back while staying on through the lane, held sway for the place. PERHAPS lacked early foot, angled out to be four wide turning for
home, staged a mild rally on the outside to be up for the show late. A REAL JEWEL forwardly placed while racing outside, chased the winner through the
turn and into the lane, caught late for the show. GRAN MANNA in the two path off the path, in the second flight through the turn, came up empty for the
drive. PURE SILK off a step slow, raced back, improved position while not a serious threat. DIXIE PENNY moved up to be a forward factor into the turn
while just off the inside, began to fade before a half, continued to weaken through the lane. AIDANIKE off slow, back off the pace and the inside, four wide
into the turn, tired. PEAK OF CHIC mid pack outside, four wide into the turn, gave way. BRIAR THICKET off slow, trailed throughout in showing little.
