SALSA'S RETURN reserved wide for half a mile, rallied before completing mile then drew clear while under wraps late. DUBROVSKY saved ground close
up, vied on the final turn and proved no match for the winner. RINGS OF JUPITER chased between rivals for seven furlongs, dropped back then came
again for the show. SUNSHINE WILD prompted the leader four wide then stopped after seven furlongs. DIAMOND SQUARE led off the rail for three
quarters then gave way readily.

outside, raced three wide on the turn, weakened and bested the others for the fourth spot. THATTA BOY GIRL chased early in the two path, chased on the
turn and tired. BOW TOWN CAT stalked outside rivals, chased on the turn and failed to rally. STREET APPEAL dueled inside for the early lead, shook free
on the turn, raced between rivals in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
PRESTO CHANGE O forced the pace inside, led before half a mile, dropped back midway on the final turn but came again rallying clear. LA MAMA CHULA
led early in the two path, dueled through the final turn and continued willingly. SECRET ZAR lagged far behind inside, swung wide in the stretch and finished
strongly. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL rated close up three wide, led briefly at the quarter pole but came up empty late. RACK DADDY stumbled at the start,
dropped back wide and was no factor. OUR CLAIRE BEAR saved ground off the pace and was never in contention. MY GLORY well placed in the clear
behind the dueling leaders but gave way readily.

throughout and continued gamely to the finish. MY AMANJENA broke a step slowly, alternated for the lead inside and weakened in the stretch.

outfinished. WEST HORIZEN settled at the back of pack then passed rivals without menacing. SOCIALLY ASTRAY chased off the pace inside for three
quarters and gave way. FLORENCIA lacked speed along the rail and weakened steadily. ANGEL RAPHAEL dropped back early and stopped after half a

Footnotes
SYNERGIZED quickly showed in front, set the pace racing with a clear lead, responded when challenged nearing the quarter pole and pulled away under
urging. SPEED SYNDROME trailed the field, moved up quickly between horses on the far turn, went four wide past the quarter pole, rallied outside and
came up second best. EARTHQUAKE stalked close up three wide, chased on the far turn, made a bid at the quarter pole and finished evenly in the lane.
SURFER BOY GEORGE raced off the pace inside, moved up on the far turn, went five wide past the quarter pole and gained mildly. GRAND OASIS raced
three wide early, forced a bit wide entering the first turn, settled off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. A J'S WAY forced a bit wide entering the
clubhouse turn, pressed the pace racing close up two wide early, chased inside on the far turn and faded. CAPE MAY STYLE pulled early on the rail,
bothered rivals slightly and was steadied entering the first turn, then tracked inside and faded.

FACTOR THIS IN controlled the pace inside, repelled repeated challenges and gamely held rival safe through the final furlong. MIDNIGHT ACT stalked the
pace inside, angled out advancing in the stretch and made a gradual late gain. IYWAAN settled inside, moved wide rallying on the final turn and into the
stretch but was too late. DIAMOND SETTER saved ground off the leaders, faded before half a mile then rallied inside while no threat. JAMMIN JIMTOWN
pressed the winner to the stretch and gave way. SEAT OF HONOR rushed to contention wide before half a mile then faded. PETULANT DELIGHT
stumbled badly at the start breaking well behind his field then chased wide and faltered.

Footnotes
ZITMAN raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide at the half mile marker, bid three wide entering the far turn, dueled, took over turning for home,
drew off under some urging and then was ridden out. CASTLE CASANOVA tracked close up on the inside, bid two wide on the backside, dueled, then
dueled with the winner on the far turn, dug in gamely, was no match for that rival and clear for the place award. NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY was bumped at
the start, outrun early, advanced inside on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly for third. NOBLE KENT raced off the pace inside,
chased on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied mildly and was outkicked for third. SIGHT LINE set the pace, then dueled inside and faded.
KLAATU raced three wide early, settled off the pace and failed to threaten. LOAN ME YOUR EAR was bumped at the start, raced four wide early, settled off
the pace and did not factor. GAMBIT was bumped at the start, raced five wide early, then chased outside and gave way. THREATLOVESMIDNITE stalked
two wide and gave way.
