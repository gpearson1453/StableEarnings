rallied. APRILNESS , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened and switched to her left lead late. HELLO GRACIE lacked speed, swung to
the four path in upper stretch and flattened out. MAVILUS swung to the five path in upper stretch and lacked a serious response. CAPE COD SALLY trailed.

Footnotes
BELLE TAPISSERIE held a short lead three wide between rivals while under rating into and around the turn, was roused clear in mid stretch, kept on
tenaciously under solid handling and kept MOJOVATION at bay. MOJOVATION flashed speed to the inside of rivals, drafted back as a battled developed up
front, angled five wide generating a run into the lane, straightened away to make a bold move past the furlong grounds, continued gamely but just could not
get past the winner. DAY THE MUSIC DIED , with the pace four deep, was under pressure into the stretch but failed to generate the needed finish.
CANDYGRAMFORMONGO had speed, chased two wide wide between runners past the five sixteenths, stayed in touch to about mid stretch and faded.
WARM SUNNY BREEZE bobbled slightly at the break, recovered and contested the pace inside rivals, remained along the inner rail into the stretch and
gave way. UPLIFTING was taken back off the leaders into the turn, raced under rating four wide around the turn and failed to threaten while under some
hand coaxing in the lane.

Footnotes
BRING ME ANSWERS set the pace near the inner rail, drifted out turning for home and dug in late to prevail. CHINA CAT lacked speed, raced in the two
path on the far turn, remained in the two path in the stretch and rallied inside foes. OUR STAR , along the rail around the first turn, swung outside mid way
down the backstretch, advanced three deep around the far turn then flattened out. SIMMARD SHENANIGAN prompted the pace outside the winner, failed
to keep up on the far turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and faded. MISDRIVEN , three wide entering the first turn, raced in the two path on the far
turn and was never a serious factor. TWO CARAT , along the inner rail most of the trip, failed to rally. INTOXICOLOGIST , three wide on the turns,
retreated.

Footnotes
ARMANDO R , in closest pursuit of the run-off leader past the five eighths, took up serious chase after being put to asking leaving the three eighths, moved
to front in upper stretch, kicked clear under a drive past the furlong grounds and steadily widened while kept to task. IRISHMAN , in tight at the break,
settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out leaving the far turn, circled five wide into the stretch and closed steadily to nab the place. SEBASTIAN
saved ground under rating past the wire the first time, steadied off heels leaving the seven eighths, eased out to progress between runners around the far
turn, continued progress between foes into the stretch, had aim in mid stretch and kept trying to the wire. TIPYOURHATTOTHAT , three to four wide, gained
under asking past the five sixteenths, chased to mid stretch then flattened out. SHANGHAIED ASTORIA lagged off the pace, made a mild run off the rail
past mid stretch but needed more. COSMICALITY pulled his way clear around the first turn and dropped in to set the pace, moved out to a lengthy
advantage while unable to really settle, saw his lead dwindle approaching the lane, kept on with effort past mid stretch then succumbed through the final
seventy yards. MR. MOSLEY saved ground giving early chase, remained somewhat of a presence to about the quarter pole then weakened.

Footnotes
TAPPAHANNOCK sprinted to a two wide lead approaching the half mile, set the pace off the rail and was kept to his business in the drive. COMPANY
CLOWN , checked in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path on the turn, swung four wide in upper stretch and rallied. AUDACIOUS
QUALITY , three wide around the turn chasing the pace, flattened out. AMEN CORNER , four wide on the turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch and
passed tired rivals. JUSTICE OF WAR was not a factor while racing between horses. BIG RINNE lacked speed and was not a factor. GATOR FIFTY TWO
bore out leaving the starting gate, steadied on the heels of FERNWOOD near the half mile, hugged the inner rail, steadied lacking room in upper stretch and
failed to be a late factor. TIZ AUCTION TIME hopped at the break, floated to the five path in upper stretch and weakened. FERNWOOD DRIVE showed
speed along the inner rail and faltered.

Footnotes
GOLDEN CANDY rated behind foes leaving the far turn, angled out and progressed four wide into the lane, leveled off under left handed pressure in mid
stretch, sustained while on his left lead, forged to command outside rivals in deep stretch then went clear at the wire. ZIGGY MON sped clear to the outside
of runners nearing the half mile marker, dropped in to set the pace, was engaged after three furlongs, dueled, lost command past the three sixteenths,
battled back inside the furlong grounds and continued gamely to the line. STROLL SMOKIN , taken to rate early, advanced three wide under a ride mid turn,
closed in on his left lead past the eighth pole but wasn't quite good enough. NOBLE COMMANDER , away in good order and flashed speed, drafted back
off the leaders nearing the turn, stalked outside a rival, moved up past mid stretch, dropped in and finished with good energy to the inside of rivals.
BROOKS ROBINSON had speed, eased back off the leader, tracked two wide, bid to engage past mid turn, dueled and gained a short lead heading to the
eighth pole, failed to sustain past the sixteenth marker and faded. THREES OVER DEUCES , sluggish from the gate, was under urging early while three to
four wide, shifted five wide for the drive and had belated action. TAPPIN CAT , off the pace, raced three wide into the lane and had a mild kick. IN THE
LOOP was nudged along while unable to keep pace, saved ground into the lane and weakened. TRINGALE stumbled badly at the break, saved ground and
was outrun.

ELOQUENT LADY stalked the pace, circled the turn three deep, closed determinedly and was up in time between horses. PROMENADE PRINCESS raced
in the two path around the turn, swung four wide in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. GRAND SKYLARK sprinted clear on the turn, hugged the inner
rail in the stretch, remained on her left lead and weakened late. MILLIE CHILD hugged the inner rail entering the turn, was lightly steadied inside
PROMENADE PRINCESS near the three eighths pole then failed to rally. DON'TBAGGAGECHECK showed speed along the inner rail, angled to the two
path in upper stretch and weakened. RUSSIAN MELODY stumbled at the break, raced two wide on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and
weakened. An objection by the rider of MILLIE CHILD against PROMENADE PRINCESS for alleged interference near the three eighths pole was not
allowed.

Footnotes
LIV AND LET LIV rated off the leader early on and angled out, bid two wide in hand mid turn, secured command, opened up under a drive in mid stretch,
widened and was kept busy to late. PRETTY LORI sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, was joined by the winner mid turn, was no match for the
that one leaving the three sixteenths but kept on willingly to be clear for the place. HIPNOTIZADA broke poorly, edged up between rivals into the turn, was
the closest pursuer of the top pair entering the lane but lacked a solid finish. TRITONE GAL , well back early, raced four wide into the lane and offered a
mild response. KEWPIE DOLL saved ground while edged up inside rivals into the turn, chased around the turn and faded. TIZ FERGUSON , away alertly,
chased into the turn but lacked a stretch response. CHARGINA was rated back off the pace, saved ground under rating into the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
MO ZONE stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the two path between horses to challenge for the lead mid way on the far turn, asserted
himself in upper stretch and drew away. CAMPARI , along the inner rail most of the trip, rallied nicely. FEATURE ACT moved up three deep to bid for the
lead mid way on the far turn and faded in the drive. MONKEY'S MEDAL lacked speed and was not a factor. HE'S NOT CURLY sprinted to the early lead,
set the pace along the inner rail and faltered on the far turn. IRISHTOWN , three wide the far turn, was outrun.
