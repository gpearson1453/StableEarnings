PICKLES N ME stalked the early leader three wide, reeled that one in going to the far turn, moved clear into the lane and drew off under steady urging. P R
WHY NOT settled off the early pace racing three wide, moved inside going to the far turn, rallied through that bend and continued on to gain the place while
no match for the winner. PRINCE B moved to a clear lead racing about the two or three path, came to the four path into the lane and had nothing left. P R
STREAKIN broke hard into the side of the gate to get away last, moved up outside to best the others only. TERRIFIC JO was not a threat four wide. CRAZY
STEELE followed the pace along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
YODELERS WAY stalked the pace four wide in good position, rallied in the lane and went clear under steady urging. MAXIMUS THE GREAT tracked the
early leader three wide, bid into the lane then could not handle the winner. SOUTHERN MOJO moved to the front racing about the two or three path, made
the pace to late in the far turn and came up empty in the drive. PAPA CABALLERO stalked the pace two or three wide and had no closing bid.
OVERANALYZER followed the pace four wide and weakened. HORSE FLY was not a threat racing outside. STOCKED was always back four wide.
BRETT'S BOY saved ground and was outrun.

Footnotes
PREACHER was just off the early pace outside COUNTRY BOY CHARM to rally five wide into the lane and was slowly edging clear. COUNTRY BOY
CHARM broke outward to bump with a rival, made the lead out from the rail, came to the four path into the lane and could not handle the winner late. BEAR
ME A MOMENT was nearest the top pair three or four wide and continued evenly in the lane to hold position. UP TIME lacked a closing bid four wide. IF
THE BOOT FITS saved ground and lacked a rally. HI HEAT BOY was bumped at the break and had no rally four wide. CORKY was five wide in the turn and
failed to mount a bid. NO PROBLEMO was shuffled back between rivals at the start and was always back. BRAVE RIFLE was not a factor racing five wide.

ground and failed to mount a bid. MITCHELL COUNTY chased the pace from four wide and weakened. BEHOLD DE FLAME got out into the turn to enter
the bend five wide, was corrected to three or four wide in that bend but did not threaten. SADDLE IN COMMANDO was carried wide into the turn and

Footnotes
CLINE TIME moved to the front racing about the three path, widened in the far turn then held the margin in the lane under steady handling. GOTTA GO BO
saved ground to the far turn, angled four wide to move up in that bend and gained the place but was no threat to the winner. DIXIE CHIP stalked the pace
four wide and lacked a final closing rally. MISS CHIT was just off the pace three or four wide, move in through the far turn and weakened. SWINGIN
DOORS chased along the inside then shortened stride in the far turn. MISS MAGDALENA failed to mount a bid racing three or four wide. D L'S GIRL was
always back racing four and five wide. AWESOME VALENTINA broke through the starting gate prior to the start, was finished early, eased and completed
the course in her own time.

Footnotes
DISTINCT FLIRT stalked the pace from four wide to bid into the far turn, moved clear into the lane and held sway under steady handling. ANWARA followed
the pace three wide, moved up into the lane and gained the place late. HOBBS HOPE was four and five wide just off the pace, came six wide into the lane
and went evenly late. TRUE ALLEGIANCE was on the pace about the three path inside a rival and weakened once headed in the lane. EYE ON HARPER
saved ground and moved up but lacked a solid closing bid. FRANKI D ORO lacked a solid rally racing three wide. IZE DISCREET ROSE was just off the
early pace two or three wide and weakened. HOLY MARIE was always back. GOLD ZEPHYR forced the pace outside a rival to the far turn and tired.
