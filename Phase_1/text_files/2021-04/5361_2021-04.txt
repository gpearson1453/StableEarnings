CONTINUALLY, forwardly placed while angling to the rail to track just inside the leaders to the backstretch, shifted three wide nearing the far turn while
being prompted to advance, pressed the issue to gain the advantage in upper stretch and went clear under firm handling. DREAMING OF AUDREY,
pinched back out of tight quarters at the start, settled outside foes off the second flight, was prompted to gain position between rivals racing into the far turn,
shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prove best of the others. EMIRATES AFFAIR was urged forcing the pace
outside a rival to the backstretch, dueled between foes on the far turn to upper stretch and gave way. TAKE JOY, urged to dispute the pace on a narrow
advantage racing a bit off the rail into the backstretch, dueled inside foes on the far turn and gave way nearing midstretch. FASTLIFE tracked off the first
flight four wide to the backstretch, was fanned five wide nearing the lane and offered no rally. NABRUZZI settled inside along the inside early and failed to
menace. MA COCO was a brief factor between foes in second flight but retreated early. FIVE K KITTEN hopped at the start and dropped out of contention
early.

Footnotes
BACI broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, pressed that foe to go clear midway through the turn, then maintained
a comfortable advantage to the closing stages under firm encouragement. SARJENALLI tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening quarter, was
caught four wide racing into the turn, angled to the inside racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to edge a rival for the place honors late. ITALIAN
JUSTICE was rated just off the leaders along the inside in the opening stages, shifted out three wide nearing the turn carrying out a rival entering the bend,
raced in the four path into upper stretch and faded late to lose the place honors. MOON ME AGAIN, off last, was urged inside the eventual winner disputing
the pace racing through the backstretch into the turn but gave way early.

Footnotes
WICKED STRONG ALEX was urged disputing the pace inside a rival racing a bit off the rail through the backstretch, lost the advantage entering the turn,
continued with a resurgent effort to wrest the advantage leaving the furlong and went clear late under energetic handling. SUPER EDGAR was urged forcing
the pace outside the eventual winner in the opening quarter, edged forward to a narrow advantage midway through the turn but proved no match late. TRUE
GRACE tracked off the first flight outside foes racing a bit wide into the turn but had no closing bid while continuing well enough to edge a rival for a share.
ACTION WARRIOR angled to the rail tracking just off the first flight inside foes racing into the turn and continued evenly into the stretch. MONDAY'S WITH
MIKE tracked off the first flight between foes in early stages, shifted out entering the turn but gave way after a half. BOX CANDY settled into stride off the
second flight racing well off the rail but failed to mount a serious challenge. IFEELGOOD settled outside a rival in the last flight early and proved no threat.

BANYAN BREEZE broke readily, shook clear of his rivals in the opening furlong, held sway on a commanding advantage racing to the lane and was kept to
firm encouragement to widen the margin. LIL GREEN MACHINE, urged to a forward position tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance early,
proved best of the others while no real threat. DEVILISH TAIL settled early, angled to the inside entering the stretch and edged a rival for a share while
proving no threat. BIZ NOW made brief pursuit of the eventual winner inside foes racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. AND THE OSCAR GOES
swerved in at the start while getting away slowly, settled last to the turn and failed to menace. UPRISE broke awkwardly and dropped out early.

SUN SQUALL broke outwards exchanging contact with FIRST HOMESTEAD, was righted to track off the first flight between foes while shifting to the four
path racing through the backstretch, steadily advanced on the leaders four wide nearing upper stretch, then wrested the advantage leaving midstretch to go
clear late under firm encouragement. VEGAS LIFE joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival into upper stretch,
proved no match when confronted by the winner but edged a rival for the place honors late. PRETTY CHITU, urged inside foes pressing the pace from the
outset, edged forward to a narrow advantage between calls dueling for command into upper stretch but yielded in late stages. ANDREW THE BULL tracked
off the first flight inside foes while shifting to the three path racing to the turn, angled inwards nearing upper stretch and continued evenly to late stages.
IMPERIAL IVOR settled last along the inside early, angled four wide into upper stretch and made an effort to improve position late. SOUL REFLECTION
angled inwards while being urged between foes dictating the pace on a narrow margin from the outset into the turn and gave way abruptly in upper stretch.
FIRST HOMESTEAD exchanged bumps at the start, angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the turn and failed to menace thereafter.
UNCLE KEVIN tracked off the first flight three deep racing in the five path to the turn and dropped out nearing the lane.

READY ORB NOT, a bit sluggish in the opening stages while dropping out last, gathered some momentum entering the bend while switching off the inside,
advanced to contention five wide into upper stretch, shifted inwards under pressure but took over and went clear under firm encouragement. PEACEFUL
WAY, forwardly placed between rivals prompting the pace in the opening stages, was eased off the pace entering the turn, shifted to the inside nearing
upper stretch while being urged to challenge inside the pacesetter but was outkicked by the winner. BETTERTHENYOURX tracked off the first flight along
the inside racing to the turn, switched out racing into upper stretch and improved her placing three wide late. LOVIELEE joined the pace three wide in early
stages, went clear on the turn while angling inwards nearing upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum past the furlong marker. TEA PARTY, urged
inside foes pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way after a half. R AVERIE LYNN tracked off the first flight outside a rival in early stages,
shifted out three deep on the turn but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
UPPER SPEED DS was rated between foes well off the second flight to the backstretch, gathered moment nearing the far turn while angling inside,
advanced inside rivals leaving the far turn to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, went clear into the lane, then shifted out nearing the wire making
light contact with MONAD but held that rival under pressure. The latter, off a bit slowly, settled last to the backstretch, gained position between foes just off
the inside racing into the far turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch, then steadily closed the gap in late stages while being bumped lightly
approaching the wire but failed to gain even terms with her rival. UNIQUE GIRL tracked the pacesetter along the inside as part of the second flight, shifted
out entering the far turn, then continued with an even effort three wide in the closing stages to edge a rival for a share late. MAY BEAU settled off the
second flight racing four wide to the backstretch, angled inwards racing into the far turn and continued with an effort to improve position. INPENDING
BREEZE tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight, advanced to lodge a brief bid on the far turn but gave way in the drive. SASSY MELLY
sprinted clear along the inside, held sway on a clear margin to the far turn, was headed while between foes racing into upper stretch and gave way entering
the lane. HELLO PRINCESS, raced three wide between foes to the backstretch and proved no threat. THIRSTYFORAMIRACLE tracked off the second
flight inside foes in the opening stages but retreated early. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF MONAD LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST
THE RIDER OF UPPER SPEED DS FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE WIRE WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER
REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED UPPER SPEED DS FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER SECOND.

Footnotes
SEE ME SEE YOU was urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage midstretch and widened
the margin late under firm encouragement. SHARON'S LAW angled to the inside early tracking well off the second flight racing to the turn, saved ground on
the bend, then shifted out three wide in the closing stages to best the others. CHATTIN WITH JENNY tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the
turn, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch to close the gap on the pacesetter but had no final bid. MEANASASNAKE, urged forcing the pace outside
the eventual winner racing into the turn to upper stretch, gave way in late stages. SAVED AT THE WIRE, reserved last along the inside racing to the turn,
passed inside tiring rivals in late stages. BABY BEE MERRY angled inwards while making brief pursuit of the leaders inside foes racing to the turn but soon
gave way. LA WAPA tracked just off the leaders three wide in second flight racing to the turn but gave way after a half. GALIT JAK tracked off the second
flight four wide racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the stretch.

Footnotes
TONY SMALL, off last, was rated off the second flight near the inside racing through the backstretch, gained some position inside foes on the turn, shifted
out four wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to wrest a clear advantage in time under some right handed encouragement.
PERFETTO tracked off the first flight while angling to the inside, advanced along the rail on the turn, came through close quarters to challenge for command
in upper stretch gaining a narrow advantage but proved no match for the winner late. HEY BIG GUY, held up well off the leaders in the opening stages,
steadily advanced to contention racing four wide into the turn, shifted inwards nearing upper stretch to challenge for command three deep gaining a brief
advantage but weakened between the top pair late. FOURTH DESIGN tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the turn and continued evenly to
late stages. PAPAJUDGY was urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the turn, dueled between foes into upper stretch and
gave way. LIBERTARIAN settled last racing to the turn, angled five wide entering the lane but made no real impression. QUICK ENTRY angled inwards
while prompting the pacesetter between foes racing to the turn but gave way early. UNFLAPPABLE MAX angled inwards to prompt the pace three wide on
the backstretch but retreated early.
