Footnotes
MISS SKI was allowed to settle early, gained along the turn while saving ground, and angled out in the drive to confront TRULY FABULOUS in the late
stages and prevail. TRULY FABULOUS stalked the early pace, was three wide along the turn, took the lead inside of the eighth pole but could not hold off
MISS SKI while besting the rest. THRILL'S LEGACY chased the early pace, was a bit rank behind horses on the turn while two wide, and was outfinished in
the stretch drive. SPUN AWAY had no speed early, was three wide along the turn, and finished evenly in the stretch drive. COASTAL STARLITE had no
speed early, saved ground along the turn while two wide, and made a mild late bid in the stretch, though was not challenging the leaders. LASTING LIGHT
assumed command of the early fractions, saved ground along the turn, led into the stretch but weakened in the final stages. MISS SUPER SAINT chased
the early pace, was three wide along the turn, was outrun into the stretch and gave out late.

Footnotes
WATCH THE FED pressed the early pace, confronted SOUTHERN VENTURE nearing the quarter pole to get the lead, was roused in the stretch and was
clear late. CHIEFTESS AINE was off a step slow, moved up into contention while chasing the leaders four wide along the turn, swung widest into the stretch
and was outfinished late. SWEET TOPPER chased the early pace, tracked three wide along the turn, was kept to task in the stretch but tired late. STAND
IN YOUR LOVE was unhurried early, was two wide on the turn, and tired in the stretch run. THAT'S MY STORY settled in the middle of the pack, was
outrun on the turn while saving ground, and weakened in the stretch run. SOUTHERN VENTURE was sent to the lead, was pressed by WATCH THE FED,
gave up the lead to that foe along the turn, and was done after a half.

SIDE EFFECT (GB) stalked the early pace, pounced on PREMIERE LADY along the second turn while two wide, was a bit erratic through the stretch but
maintained a clear lead to the wire as much the best. MUSIC BABE was unhurried early, saved ground along the second turn, angled out for the stretch run
and made a steady bid for second, though was not challenging the winner. HAL'S BUDDY was allowed to settle early, saved ground through the backstretch
and second turn while improving position, but could not go on with that run and was outfinished in the stretch drive. AVALON RIDE was allowed to settle,
was four wide along the second turn, and had no late rally. NORTHERN ROSE settled in the midflight, was three wide along the second turn, and had no
late response. PREMIERE LADY set the early fractions, was collared by SIDE EFFECT (GB) along the second turn and weakened late. REAL KEEPER
chased the early pace, was two wide along the second turn while losing position and gave out in the stretch drive.

TIZ AN EDVENTURE dueled with BEAUTYINTHESKY on the front end, saved ground along the turn, put away BEAUTYINTHESKY nearing the eighth pole
and was clear late, while running on her left lead. EXQUISITE LEGACY collided with BEAUTYINTHESKY leaving the gate, settled in the midflight, was three
wide along the turn, and made a mild late bid for second though was not challenging the winner. NOBU chased the early pace, was four wide along the turn
and tired in the stretch, though still holding third. BEAUTYINTHESKY collided with EXQUISITE LEGACY leaving the gate, was rank early while close to the
pace, dueled with TIZ AN ADVENTURE on the front end, was two wide between horses on the turn and weakened in the stretch drive. LIFE IN PARADISE
was allowed to settle early, saved ground through the turn, and lacked a late rally. JAXONS TOUR GUIDE had no early speed, was four wide along the turn
and was always outrun.

Footnotes
MISS EVER READY was allowed to settle, was four wide on the second turn while improving position, swung widest for the stretch drive, battled with
TRIBAL NATION through the final stages, made contact with that rival late, but prevailed in the end. TRIBAL NATION took command of early fractions, was
three wide on the first turn while setting the pace, continued to be wide through the second turn, was confronted in deep stretch by MISS EVER READY,
made contact with that rival, and could not hold that one off, while holding for second. LOTSABLING settled in the middle of the pack, saved ground along
the second turn, improved position into the stretch and made a late rally to get third. BIG WISH settled in the midflight early, was three wide on the second
turn while improving position, but could not go on with that run and tired in the stretch. AL MILLON BOB chased the early pace, saved ground along the
second turn while still close up, lost position into the stretch and weakened in the stretch drive. BARHOPSKY had no early speed, saved ground through the
second turn and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ISLAND LIFE pressed the leader to the turn, was three then four wide to the stretch, rallied to overtake CUTETIP leaving mid stretch and edged clear
driving. WHERE'S FRANKIE was outsprinted to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch, was widest for the drive and finished steadily for second.
SLEW OF FASHION was outrun to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch but could only pick off rivals late. CUTETIP hustled to the front while racing well
off the rail, was in the three path to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch but was tiring late. GOOD TIME DOLLY tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch
but lacked the needed late response. GARDEN IN THE SKY stalked the leader while outside rivals, raced four wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid
stretch and weakened. BIG CHICK had no speed and was not a factor. MARK WHATS MINE was through early.

Footnotes
STALKING SHADOW was unhurried to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch then responded when set down, closed fast in the late stages and
was up to tag his stable partner late. JIMMY IRISH flashed good speed, was on the lead to the second turn, dueled PARNELLI to the stretch then put that
one away in mid stretch but could not hold off the winner. PARNELLI pressed JIMMY IRISH for a half mile, pushed up to duel that one on the second turn,
got outkicked in upper stretch and weakened late. GOVENOR'S PARTY was allowed to settle for five furlongs, bid three wide on the second turn and into
the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. TESORO had no speed, settled to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then also
lacked a late bid. OMPH was outrun to the second turn, briefly offered a bid four wide to the quarter pole but flattened out in the stretch. TWILIGHT RIDER
was also settled to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. LOST IN SPACE (IRE) hit the gate at the start, recovered
slowly and trailed throughout.

WHISPER NOT (GB) was unhurried to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, rallied and engaged KEEPER OFTHE STARS in mid stretch then dug
in determinedly to best that one. KEEPER OFTHE STARS was also unhurried, raced two wide, rallied on the second turn, battled the winner but was erratic
and switching leads and missed. RESTRAINEDVENGENCE had no speed, settled to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then shifted out and
came on late between rivals. BROWN STORM (CHI) settled mid pack to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then closed the gap in the final furlong

leader to the second turn then also saved ground but weakened in mid stretch. DIAMOND BLITZ hustled to a long lead to the second turn then was tiring

Footnotes
PIZZAZZ stalked the early pace of EMPIRE HOUSE, collared that rival entering the stretch, was pressured late by FREEDOM FLYER but dug in and held
that rival off to prevail. FREEDOM FLYER chased the early pace, was two wide while close up on the second turn, made a steady run through the stretch to
pressure PIZZAZZ late but could not get by that rival while still besting the rest. STYLEDOME (IRE) was allowed to settle early, improved position along the
second turn while traveling two wide, and made a late rally for third, though was not challenging the top two. MISS PEAKY BLINDER was five wide on the
first turn, settled in the middle of the pack, improved position on the second turn while four wide, and made a late rally in the stretch, though was not
challenging the top three. IDA CLAIRE settled midflight in the early stages, saved ground through the second turn, and made a steady run in the stretch.
RISEN LADY settled in the middle of the pack, was outrun on the second turn while three wide, but found her best running late and made a mild stretch
rally. JOYMAKER had no speed early, improved position into the stretch and continued with that bid to make a mild rally in the stretch. A REAL HERO was
allowed to settle early, was four wide along the second turn, lost position into the stretch and finished evenly in the drive. MISTY CAT bobbled at the start,
settled in the midflight, improved position on the second turn while three wide, but could not go on with that run and tired late. EMPIRE HOUSE was sent
from the start to set the early fractions, saved ground along the turn while being pressed on the lead, was outrun into the stretch and weakened in the drive.
LIAM'S SECRET chased the early pace, kept a two wide running position through the second turn while losing position, and was empty for the stretch run.
THE JOCKEY OF #11 FREEDOM FLYER CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF #7 PIZZAZZ, AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION THE
STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
GYPSY SPIRIT (GB) checked in tight on the backstretch, chased the leaders, was fanned four wide to the stretch, shifted out, responded to pressure and
closed steadily to prevail. ACTING OUT attended the pace outside a rival and three wide to the stretch, took a short lead leaving mid stretch then could not
stall the winner but got the nod for second. SADIE BLUEGRASS tracked the pace early, was pinched and checked in tight quarters midway on the turn then
was caught behind rivals and blocked from upper stretch to just inside the chute gap and finished willingly once clear. NARDINI tracked the pace also to the
turn, raced three wide to the stretch, loomed a threat in mid stretch but was outfinished. DYNASTY OF HER OWN had no speed, raced two wide to the
stretch then was gaining ground belatedly. SQUARE PEGGY chased the leaders from the rail to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and finished
evenly. GOTHAM DESIRE was outsprinted to the turn, raced four wide then shifted out into the stretch and was closing some ground late. STORMING
LADY also was outrun to the turn, rallied inside to mid stretch to loom a threat but lost her punch late. RED LIVY (IRE) hustled to the lead, set the pace from
off the rail to the stretch then was collared in mid stretch and tired. BOHEMIAN BOURBON had no speed, was forced to circle seven wide on the turn and
could not make an impact late.

Footnotes
ANYPORTINASTORM pressed the early fractions from BETTOR TRIP NICK, was two wide on the turn while taking the lead near the quarter pole, was
roused early in the drive and kicked clear late. BAJA SUR chased the early pace, saved ground through the turn, and was outkicked in the stretch by the
winner. THANKS MR. EIDSON was allowed to settle early, improved position along the turn while four wide, but could not go on with that bid and was
outfinished in the drive. JAMMING EDDY chased the early pace, was three wide along the turn between horses and tired in the stretch run. EL CHAVO DEL
OCHO was bumped at the start by BETTOR TRIP NICK, had no early speed, was three wide along the turn while toward the back, and made a mild late
rally in the stretch. SUNSET DRAGUNN was allowed to settle early, improved position along the turn while two wide between horses, but could not continue
with that run and tired in the stretch drive. BETTOR TRIP NICK bumped EL CHAVO DEL OCHO at the start, assumed command of pace duties, was
collared by ANYPORTINASTORM nearing the quarter pole, and gave out in the stretch run. SILENT MOVIES was allowed to settle, was outrun on the turn
while saving ground and had no late response.
