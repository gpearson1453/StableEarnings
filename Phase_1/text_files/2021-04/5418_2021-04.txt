DRAKESBORO WILDCAT , three deep approaching the first turn, was taken to the inner rail after sprinting clear mid way on the bend, set the pace along
the rail and was under brisk urging late. SUPER HOUDINI lacked speed, took the far turn two wide, swung to the four path in upper stretch and rallied.
BUZZHOUND , swung out near the three eighths pole, drifted wide near the quarter pole and passed a tired rival. MR. SHADES OF GRAY , rank in close
quarters entering the first turn, chased the pace and gave way. TYLER TIME lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the far turn and in the stretch but
failed to rally.

Footnotes
WELLING settled off of a contested pace, edged up in the two path leaving the far turn, angled out soon after, advanced four to five wide into the lane,
leveled off under left handed rousing and put a head in front leaving the furlong grounds, widened and was kept to task. UNBEKNOWNST TO ME vied
between runners nearing the first turn, rated back past the seven eighths and angled three wide to stalk, bid three deep in hand past the five sixteenths,
spurted clear when roused into the lane, had his rider lose the whip when collared near mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. GREEK PRINCE , inside a
pair of foes when contesting the pace into the first turn, eased back a bit nearing the five eighths, rebid near the half mile marker, dueled to the quarter pole
then faded through the drive. BOLD QUEST , four wide most of the trip, came up empty. WYE MUMBO hopped and was a bit rank at the start, vied three
deep into the first turn, went clear with five eighths to go, was re engaged from his inside near the half mile marker, sparred to the quarter pole then
weakened past the three sixteenths. FIND YOUR BOAZ was outrun.

Footnotes
LOOKS DON'T LIE set the pace slightly off the rail, came out a bit in upper stretch then herded CLASSY BUT SASSY when drifting out from the eighth pole
to the sixteenth pole. CLASSY BUT SASSY stalked the pace for a half mile, eased outside at the head of the stretch, reached a striking position
approaching the eighth pole, was herded out from the eighth pole to the sixteenth pole, raced on her left lead and hung. LILY CHASER chased the pace two
wide, was done leaving the turn and steadily retreated through the stretch. WHITE WHISKEY broke sluggishly, raced three deep entering the stretch and
passed tired horses. BRIEF REACTION raced along the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. WESTERN MOVIES bumped with INDUBITABLE leving
the starting gate, circled the turn while chasing the pace, gave way and drifted in badly near the eighth pole. INDUBITABLE bumped with WESTERN
MOVIES leaving the starting gate, drifted out leaving the backstretch and was not a factor. Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of
CLASSY BUT SASSY, LOOKS DON'T LIE was disqualified and placed second.

Footnotes
MARGIE'S HEAVEN prompted the pace three wide outside ALWAYS SOMETHING, responded when shaken up entering the lane, shook clear leaving the
eighth pole then was fully extended to prevail. PRINCESS COREY stalked between foes, was under asking past the five sixteenths, swung four wide for the
drive and closed gamely to gain. LUCRE broke a step slow, settled off the pace while saving ground, cut the corner into the lane and moved up near mid
stretch, shifted out and finished with good energy to bridge the gap. ALWAYS SOMETHING hustled to the front, set the pace two wide while handling
outside pressure, dueled into the lane, battled to mid stretch then faded. BETHABARA lacked speed two to three wide, shifted five wide in the drive and
closed steadily. JENN'S THE BOSS , four wide pursuing the embattled leaders, failed to go on while under asking into the lane and gave way. UNO
TIGRESS saved ground in a forward position, was under a ride chasing the leaders into the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths, dropped back
and was reported by the stewards to have bled.

Footnotes
IRREPRESSIBLE went to the early lead, opened up on the backstretch and was under urging in the drive. LUMINIST had a hind shoe fixed in the paddock,
steadied lacking room leaving the backstretch, found room along the inner rail through the stretch, was under brisk urging inside the eighth pole and rallied.
HIGHTAILING , well placed along the inner rail leaving the far tun, drifted out near the eighth pole and gave way. GOLDEN LASSIE hopped at the break,
circled both turns three wide, chased the pace and faded. BAFFLE 'EM , bumped at the break, lost ground both turns and weakened. SAME MOON ,
carried out by CELESTIAL DIVA entering the first turn, was far back to the stretch and passed tired horses. CELESTIAL DIVA bore out entering the first turn
and was no factor. FLAVA'S DREAM chased the pace and gave way. OUR BELLA NICOLE faltered and was eased late. CORAL SUMMER chased the
pace, faltered and was eased.

and moved up to take measure of the leaders while three wide, bid four wide past the quarter pole, gained command soon into the lane, dug in when

Footnotes
SHERIFF CHIP sprinted to the early lead along the inner rail, opened up leaving the turn then eagerly extended his advantage through the stretch while
under encouragement. SWEET ASTA , swung to the four path in upper stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. RAVEN RAHY , three deep on
the turn chasing the winner, weakened. DAY OF HONOR , wide around the turn, passed tired foes. I WANT MORE bore out leaving the starting gate, raced
inside horses on the turn and retreated through the stretch. SHORTLISTER , a forward factor inside horses while chasing the winner around the turn,
weakened. THE FIRE WITHIN came in at the break and was outrun. GONNA WIN IT , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was not a factor.
UNBRIDLED PARROTT chased the early pace, hugged the inner rail around the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
TITAN'S WILL , forwardly placed into the first turn, angled out soon into the backstretch to stalk the leaders three wide, bid three deep into the far turn, took
over from GOODLUCKCHUCK near the quarter pole, opened up under a stout drive past the three sixteenths, drifted in towards the rail, kept on under
pressure and held sway. WALK AWAY JOE was squeezed back from between foes under the wire the first time, angled out and settled three to four wide,
gathered momentum leaving the three eighths, circled four wide continuing his run into the lane and kept on grinding to close the gap. OTHER THINGS
EQUAL broke outward and bumped with GOODLUCKCHUCK, lagged well back through six furlongs, circled five wide into the lane, leveled off to his best
stride past mid stretch and was going well but too late. GOODLUCKCHUCK was bumped at the break, corrected and rushed up to contest the pace to the
inside of a rival, shook clear in the backstretch run, took pressure leaving the far turn, battled into the lane, saw the winner go clear soon after but kept on
with effort. BAHAMA CHANNEL vied outside a rival into and around the first turn, rated back to stalk nearing the three quarter pole, rebid between runners
entering the far turn, forced the issue past the five sixteenths then faded late. MY MAN POTS N PANS settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out
leaving the far turn, failed to kick on and faltered through the lane. DON'T POKE THE CAT , two wide, was under a drive past the three eighths and
stopped.

Footnotes
EL EQUALIZER caused a jam up when bearing out leaving the starting gate, gained a two wide lead leaving the far turn and drew off. SUPPORTING
ACTOR , jostled and pinched back in the jam up leaving the starting gate, eased out to the three path leaving the far turn and had a slight rally. GOLD
FELLOW lacked speed, was carried very wide by CLEVER AND GREAT mid way on the far turn then passed tired horses late. MILITARY COMMANDER
came in and was soundly bumped in the jam up leaving the starting gate, sprinted clear entering the first turn, set the pace along the inner rail and tired.
WHO'S COUNTING , along the inner rail most of the trip, weakened and returned bleeding. CLEVER AND GREAT , bumped and forced out leaving the
starting gate, drifted out mid way on the far turn, gave way and was eased. Following a stewards' inquiry and objections by the riders of SUPPORTING
ACTOR and MILITARY COMMANDER, EL EQUALIZER was disqualified and placed fourth.
