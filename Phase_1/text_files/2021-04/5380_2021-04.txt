Footnotes
AWESOME PIRATE led along the inside on the backstretch, continued to lead along the inside, shook free from rival entering the stretch and drew away.
POLITICAL LOOPHOLE off slow, settled well off the pace on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, responded to urging and rallied well in
between rivals to get up for second. THATS WHAT U GET vied two wide for the lead on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, unable to match
strides with winner and gave way late and saved show. NEW SALUTE tracked leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn,
entered stretch in the three path and kept on in upper stretch and finished up evenly. LOVE AND HOLD came out and bumped rival at the start, tracked
inside of rivals on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside, and in range entering the stretch, flattened out late, and edged at the wire. MY TREASURE
LAKE off slow, steadied at the start, trailed throughout and never a factor.
