Footnotes
HOLY EMPEROR settled comfortably into stride while off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was given his cue with three furlongs to run, cut the corner
into the stretch, moved out under a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths then rallied on the outside, closed strongly to go past the embattled leaders
approaching the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong urging. JOHNNYPUMP angled in at the rear of the field then settled at the back, was urged
along late on the backstretch, moved from the inside to the two path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, shifted out near the furlong
marker and finished well to get the place. CENTURION settled on the outside while five wide, was roused while continuing five wide on the far turn, turned
into upper stretch under a drive, was carried out some near the three-sixteenths and finished with good energy alongside JOHNNYPUMP to just miss the
place while able to get the show. BIG EASY EMPIRE was hustled to the lead, set the clear pace through quick fractions while off the inside, was asked in
the two path with three furlongs to run, lost the advantage under a drive into upper stretch, fought on well with BOURBON RISING into the final sixteenth but
was outfinished. BOURBON RISING showed early speed on the inside of a foe, was taken back off the pace early on the backstretch then switched out,
tracked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the three path on the far turn, took a narrow advantage under urging into upper stretch, battled under
a drive into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked. OUCH OUCH OUCH was well placed towards the front on the inside, came under coaxing along the rail
on the far turn, was roused for more late on that bend, shifted three wide into the stretch, drifted out around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed kick.
GRECIAN PHAROAH settled off the inside, was roused while three wide on the far turn then driven four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. LEND
AMERICA settled on the outside while racing four wide, was roused in the four path on the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
IMPERIO D brushed the near side stall at the start and came under hustling, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside
through the turn getting put to a drive at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying through the final furlong to get
up in the last jumps to the wire. JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, advanced through the turn to take command three
furlongs from home, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole,
dug in under lone threat and was caught in the final strides to the finish. BEACH FRONT chased just off the inside coming under coaxing nearing the quarter
pole, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. BIG BOY MO hustled from the start, chased two to three wide under a ride from the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on through to the finish. TRUEBELIEVE four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the
turn and angled out six wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals in the final furlong. TRAPPEZE ARTIST coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside
under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. CLIFFY hustled from the gate and under an off
sided stick at the start intent on the lead, showed the way in hand just off the inside, had JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ advance outside and yielded the front
placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch in behind the leader and weakened.

Footnotes
L'INDISCRET dropped from the four path to the two path on the initial bend, was reserved near the back, moved from the two path to the four path on the
far turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, waited off the heels of INFORMATION MOSAIC into upper stretch then altered to the inside of that foe,
gained momentum inside the three-sixteenths, rallied into the final furlong and closed well to get up under strong urging. EXCEPT TEMPTATION went three
wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, went three then four wide while roused on the far turn, gained under a drive into upper stretch, made a bid
outside the eighth-pole, kept on well in the final furlong and narrowly earned the place while unable to match strides with the winner late. WICKED HAPPY
veered out just after the start then was corrected with a tug of the left rein, went four to five wide on the opening bend, stalked outside down the backstretch,
engaged the leader in the two path on the far turn, took the advantage in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while
clear for the show. INFORMATION MOSAIC was taken in hand early then reserved off the pace, moved from the inside to the four path on the far turn,
shifted out under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, reached a reasonable striking position under a drive on the outside into the final furlong but flattened
out and lacked the needed response. TILSA went to the front, set the clear pace while inside to the two path, was asked under heavy threat near the
quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and gave way. LITTLE NUTTER came away clearly in
front but was quickly wrestled to the back of the field, moved out entering the backstretch, was reserved on the outside, went four then five wide on the far
turn and failed to respond. COSMIC KITTEN was taken under a hold early then became rank under restraint late on the first turn, tugged at the bit while
rated just off the pace under a hold, dropped back two then three wide on the far turn and came up empty. LULUS IN CHARGE went two to three wide on

Footnotes
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (IRE) was taken under a tight hold early, settled in third position under some restraint, saved ground on the far turn, shoved her
way out from behind horses in upper stretch, rallied to make a bid into the final furlong, shook clear under one pop of a right-handed crop outside the
sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under a hand ride to the wire. EARTH STRIKE (IRE) was reserved on the outside, went three to four wide on the
turn, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed well to make a bid outside the furlong marker but proved no match for the winner while able to get the place.
MISS TOURISTA settled towards the rear on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch under
a drive, chased in a good striking position into the final furlong but was out-kicked while able to get the show. CALDEE went to the front, set the clear pace
on the inside, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive outside the furlong marker and gave way. ISLAND TREASURE dropped
back early then was reserved near the middle of the field, went around the turn in the two path, was roused with three furlongs to run, moved out in upper
stretch and came up empty. SIRANEUSE was keen under restraint leaving the initial dogleg and early on the backstretch, leveled out a bit while tracking the
pace, was let out in the two to three path on the far turn, came under more encouragement outside the quarter-pole, was jostled while shoved out by the
winner in upper stretch and had nothing left. BETCHA BY GOLLY was reserved towards the rear while saving ground, came under urging inside the
five-sixteenths then moved off the rail, swung four wide into the stretch then shifted further out and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
VICI tracked the pace along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled
four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong out confronting the leader in tandem with BLIND AMBITION to his inside, took over narrow
command a sixteenth from home and dueled with that rival gamely to the finish getting the nod on the wire. BLIND AMBITION coaxed from the gate, tracked
the leader in closest aim from the two path, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, rallied between foes a furlong out, dueled through the final
sixteenth gamely but was denied at the end. KITTEN'S CAT two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. DUNCASTLE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside until
tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and was
collared a sixteenth from home, weakened in the late stages. WAR STROLL chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went seven
wide into upper stretch, offered no response. SOMEKINDOFMAGICIAN chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn
placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch, offered no rally. HONORABLE HERO three to four wide in pursuit, got coaxed
along at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. SPIKES SHIRL three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, made no impact. The 1/4 mile fraction has been omitted pending review.

Footnotes
LOST IN ROME brushed with a foe while off a step slow, moved up to take the lead then set the pace, shook clear while inside to the two path on the turn,
responded well when set down nearing the quarter-pole and drew off under steady urging. INDIAN COUNSELOR stalked the pace on the outside, was
asked in the three path on the turn, chased four wide into the stretch under a drive, fought with HOMETOWN while just inside that foe in the final furlong and
narrowly beat that opponent for the place while no match for the winner. HOMETOWN settled off the pace, was roused near the half-mile pole, went four
wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, had the crop knocked out of the riders hand inside the three-sixteenths, fought with INDIAN
COUNSELOR under a strong hand ride for the place and just missed that position while narrowly able to get the show. DUST DEVIL was reserved off the
pace, moved closer under urging in the two path on the turn, came out some under a drive into upper stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and just
missed the trifecta. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD brushed with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked while shifting four
wide near the five-sixteenths then came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally then was reported to have bled. OBSESSED moved in at the rear of the
field, was urged two to three wide on the turn and was no factor. AMERICAN RULE settled on the outside, dropped back while five then six wide on the turn
and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
OUR DESTINY displayed good speed, showed the way on a clear lead down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, responded well when asked at the
quarter-pole then came under a drive, dug in gamely under threat from the runner-up in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. LYRICAL POET
brushed with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch, made a bid outside
of the winner at the eighth-pole, battled with that foe in the final furlong and was turned away while just able to get the place. SCOCCIATORE broke near
the rear of the field, moved up under urging to race just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, chased in the final
furlong and finished with good courage to just miss the place while narrowly able to get the show. MONTATHAM settled towards the back on the outside,
was roused four wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch then bumped twice with a foe outside the three-sixteenths and finished with good energy to
just miss the trifecta. KNOCKOUT PUNCH brushed with a rival at the start, settled near the middle of the field, rounded the turn in the two path, moved out
under a drive in upper stretch, switched back to his inside lead at the furlong marker and finished willingly to just miss the superfecta. CLAMOR settled off
the pace, went three wide on the turn, shifted five wide into the stretch then bumped twice with an opponent outside the three-sixteenths and gained some
but lacked a winning kick. ERNIE BANKER settled on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, was roused while off the rail in upper stretch and failed
to reach contention. ON THE MUSCLE settled towards the rear, rounded the turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch, dropped in under a drive
around the three-sixteenths, came between horses into the final furlong and failed to threaten. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE was urged along on the outside,
went five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. DISCIPLANARIAN was unsettled in the gate, moved out in the early going while settling off the pace,
tucked from the four path to the three path on the turn, was carried out in upper stretch and came up empty. SELF AWARENESS raced well back in the
field, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor.
