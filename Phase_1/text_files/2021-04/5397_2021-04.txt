Footnotes
NAPA RULES dueled inside for a half, drew clear approaching the far turn and held clear under a drive. SASSY JUSTICE was off a step slow, raced in
range two and three wide, bid nearing the lane but was no match for the winner in upper stretch and stayed on to save the place. NYMUE'S TREASURE
settled off the pace inside, made progress at the rail around the far turn to get within a length of the winner turning for home, was boxed in through upper
stretch, angled out near the eighth pole and lacked the needed rally. AERODYNAMIC saved ground off the pace, went three wide into the far turn, steadied
midway around that turn, angled five wide near the quarter pole and never threatened. DANCE TILL DAWN broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the pace two
wide, went four wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a closing bid. LOVE DADDY lagged well back inside, angled three
wide near the five-sixteenths pole and played no factor. DIXIE PRINCESS vied outside of the winner and was through after a half.

Footnotes
CAJUN LADY vied early outside UNDERCOVER OUTLAW, let that one go on with it after a quarter-mile, rebid between horses in the three-path coming to
the five-sixteenths, kicked away from SIREN'S LUCKY SONG through upper stretch and widened under pressure. LOVIN LIVIN bumped with SIREN'S
LUCKY SONG and was slow away from the gate, lagged at the back two wide for a half-mile, rallied mildly on the rail through the lane and was up for the
place. SIREN'S LUCKY SONG bumped with LOVIN LIVIN at the start, ran up into a pocket between PRETZEL and CAJUN LADY and checked sharply past
the half-mile pole, moved out to loom a threat in the five-path coming off the turn, could not keep pace with the leader and was outfinished for second.
PRETZEL brushed the right side of the gate breaking awkwardly at the back, moved up along the inside early, then faded near the quarter-pole shifting out
four wide. BORDEAUX LEGACY was no factor four then five wide around the turn. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW vied early inside CAJUN LADY, briefly drew
clear leaving the backstretch, yielded to challengers on the turn and was through after a half.

pace three wide and was along for the show. SAIL AT SUNRISE failed to menace while racing three wide. KRSTO SKYE pressed the pace two wide and
retreated after a half.

Footnotes
BEEBOO sped clear at once, rated along near the inside to the stretch, and was kept busy facing no serious threats. BONNO was never far back, moved
out four wide approaching the quarter-pole, and finished willingly to clearly best the others. ALL POWER pursued the winner three wide to the stretch, and
stayed on late between horses to salvage the show. LITTLE DUDE veered out slamming into CHAPPY'S BREEZE at the break and had to be pulled off
strongly, moved out steadily wider through the turn to be in the five-path at the top of the lane, and improved outside for the last major share. EL ZOPILOTE
chased outside BEEBOO to the stretch, and faded on his left lead. CHAPPY'S BREEZE was mashed into HEAVEN'S TALE by LITTLE DUDE at the start,
and never recovered while two to three wide. LISA'S FIRST LOVE raced four to five wide, was under a drive by midway on the turn, and faded steadily
through the stretch. ROYAL MEETING was no factor three to four wide. HEAVEN'S TALE got sandwiched between CHAPPY'S BREEZE and MR
AWESOME and steadied back at the start, and remained far back. MR AWESOME bumped with HEAVEN'S TALE and was slow into stride, rushed up
inside early, steadied near the half-mile pole, and stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
NEW YORK'S FINEST saved ground in midpack, bid two wide nearing the eighth pole, drew clear leaving that marker and held clear under a drive. HERO
TIGER hesitated at the start, lagged well back in the two path and closed strongly between foes. HENRY'S WORLD dueled two wide down the backstretch,
cleared and angled in entering the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. MALRAUX vied inside down the backstretch, steadied as
HENRY'S WORLD cleared entering the turn, tipped out to chase two wide around the bend and faded in the lane. FINANCIAL SYSTEM was off a step slow,
raced two wide and failed to menace. WEEKEND DREAMER chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. CRYOGENIC was outrun inside.

Footnotes
CREATIVE CLOUD was under a drive after three-eighths of a mile, shifted out five wide between horses as most of the field fanned across the track at the
top of the stretch, and moved clear through the late stages. DREAM OF WARRIOR chased near the inside from the start, had the two-path into the lane,
and stayed on for the place despite neglecting to change leads. MAGIC ECLIPSE was unhurried early, advanced four wide around the turn, then flattened
out through the furlong grounds. KURT'S A KEEPER chased two to three wide for a half-mile, and weakened in the stretch. WEIGHT OF GLORY dashed
clear after a sharp start, showed the way inside to upper stretch, and succumbed past the eighth-pole. UNO TIGER broke a step slow and was squeezed
back between KURT'S A KEEPER and MAGIC ECLIPSE, circled six wide past the quarter-pole, and tired in the stretch. CLAUDE RAY broke behind the
field and trailed inside, and made no progress through the lane while drifting out.

Footnotes
MUNQAD veered in at the start, raced off the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed outside and was up and clear late. FREER
set the pace along the rail, widened in upper stretch and led until deep stretch. MOMZA steadied along inside around the first turn, made progress two wide
around the far turn but flattened out in the final furlong. TIZ A PRINCE prompted the pace two wide and weakened in the lane. EL SOCIO stalked the pace
two and three wide, lugged in nearing the eighth pole and faded. HIT THE POINT was in tight at the start, saved ground and failed to menace.
EVERESTING saved ground in midpack, went two wide between foes around the far turn, angled widest in upper stretch and lacked a rally. DEVILS SKY
was squeezed at the start, saved ground off the pace, was forced to check off heels nearing the eighth pole and had no further bids. VERRAZANO
NARROWS was bumped and squeezed back at the start, saved ground well back early, went three wide around the far turn and made little impact.
READYSEEKGO was bumped at the start, was pinched back not long after, raced two wide and never threatened. TRAIT was shut off a the start, raced four
wide and was never involved. THE RIDER OF EL SOCIO CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST TIZ A PRINCE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH
BUT THE STEWARDS FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
I KICKN was difficult to load and eventually did so without the rider, came away in good order and stayed in range to the turn inside, shifted out four wide
going past the quarter-pole, took over in upper stretch and drove clear. THE REIGN MAN was outsprinted early, shifted out five wide approaching the
stretch, and finished willingly while not a serious threat to the winner. BABY BROTHER vied early on the rail, was outpaced heading to the turn, remained
inside and stayed on for a share. FRANK ALONE pressed the early pace, vied outside STARSHIP TAXI into the turn, reached even terms for the lead
between horses a quarter-mile out, then weakened after straightening away for the drive. STARSHIP TAXI vied briefly outside BABY BROTHER, moved in
contesting the front with FRANK ALONE around the turn, weakened in the two-path into the stretch and yielded to challengers on both flanks. DON FAGER
showed little inside.

Footnotes
NATIONALIST was outrun early, took closer order through the middle fractions, split horses in the two-path joining the leaders a quarter-mile out, and drew
off through the stretch under a drive. CAT'S J N J lost her footing and bumped into CLASSY BEAST at the start, recovered to midpack up the backstretch,
shifted out four wide leaving the turn and was along outside for the place. EMOLGA hustled through along the rail in the run out of the chute, set a
pressured pace for six furlongs, and weakened in the stretch. RAIN pressed the pace three then four wide for six furlongs, and faded through the drive.
LAILONI raced four then five wide around the turn, and tired. SIMPLE STORY was two to three wide on the turn, and could not reach contention. CLASSY
BEAST bumped with CAT'S J N J at the start, pressed the pace two then three wide, and was finished after six furlongs. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED,
SEVEN-FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
JABUTICABA sprinted clear soon after the start, set a fast pace along the rail, remained well clear past the eighth pole, drifted out and switched leads when
put to left-handed pressure in deep stretch but held safe. DIAMOND PLAY saved ground off the pace, swung five wide in upper stretch and finished strongly
outside. SOMETHING MAGICAL raced closest to the winner two wide and was one-paced in the lane to hold third. BEAN COUNTER was shut off and
forced to check sharply entering the first turn, saved ground well back, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the lane and rallied
belatedly. VITAEMI raced well back two wide and finished with belated interest inside. HERA saved ground in range, angled three wide near the quarter
pole and was outkicked in the lane. ZODIAC PRINCESS failed to menace while racing two wide. MISS JEN raced three wide in midpack early, went two
wide between foes around the far turn, steadied off heels in upper stretch and never threatened. WAITING FOR A STAR broke outwardly and was outrun
outside.

Footnotes
CALABASH broke out bumping NORTHBROOK, enjoyed the garden spot isolated off dueling leaders early, stalled losing some position coming off the far
turn in the three-path, stayed on task outside rivals and got up late under heavy pressure.. DILIGENT was alone in fourth up the backstretch, caught MR.
AXEL from outside leaving the furlong grounds, but could not hold off the top one. ZIPALONG got bumped between horses and bobbled at the start, raced
well off the pace saving ground around the far turn, moved out for the drive and found his best stride belatedly. MR. AXEL bobbled and broke in bumping
CUY, vied outside LEADING FACTOR, edged away in upper stretch, but yielded past the eighth-pole. SHINING THROUGH raced two wide early, saved
ground on the far turn, and finished evenly with no apparent mishap. LEADING FACTOR vied inside MR. AXEL to the stretch, and gave way. SEIZE THE
HAY was no factor three to four wide throughout. CUY was bumped between horses at the start, and never reached contention. NORTHBROOK was
bumped from both sides at the break and slow to get going, and remained far back. CARK steadied off heels in the five-path heading into the first turn, and
never got close. COWARDLY ACT was outrun inside. HAPPY CHAMP was four wide into the first turn, and retired early.
