COUNT THEM AGAIN set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail through the turn, opened up and held for the win. MCWEND was reserved early, went
three wide into the turn, angled out, was closing late and finished second best. GRACEANNE was off slow, was void of any speed, raced along the inside
into the home turn, angled out in the drive, was gaining late and needed more ground. TUTTA TERLINGUA was allowed to settle early, went six wide into
the second turn and was empty. DATILS NATIVE LADY was taken back early, went five wide into the second turn and offered no rally. WALTZING ATTILA
pressed the early pace, went four wide into the second turn and faded.
