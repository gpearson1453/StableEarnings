Footnotes
MCENTIRE stalked the pace of BLAME IT ON RIO while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, quickly opened a
clear margin and drew off as the handiest of winners. BLAME IT ON RIO sprinted clear before going a quarter, raced three-wide while setting the pace,
gave way to the winner before going three-quarters, was no match for that foe in the drive but clearly second best. THE THIRD RING lacked early foot,
raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. OXBOW PARK raced four-wide through the first turn, settled just off the leaders, moved
three-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. BARELYSTILLCOUNTS lagged early, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
META J chased the leaders from the inside for a half and weakened.

SIX NINETY ONE sprinted clear at once, raced four-wide while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. COOL EDGE broke
sharply to chase the winner while racing five-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the place. DRIZZY raced unhurried early,
moved six-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. SOMBRA NEGRA chased the winner from between foes, moved four-wide through the
turn and gave way. BLANK IT showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. NO SUPAH FOR YOU chased the leaders
while racing three-wide and weakened through the final furlong.

Footnotes
ELEGANT CRICKET sprinted clear before going a quarter, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as a handy winner.
TUFFENOUGHTOSTART was reserved just off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner but finished well to gain the
place. TRES TAURUS lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, reached a contending position into the lane but failed to gain on the winner
late. EBB AND FLOW raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. LEMON DROP KIT KAT showed no early
speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and failed to menace. IZE A CRAFTY GAL chased the leaders while racing
five-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
PERKY BRUNETTE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and held IROQUOIS HEART at
bay to the wire. IROQUOIS HEART chased the winner while racing four-wide, moved up for a striking position after going three furlongs but could not get by
that rival in the drive. LOOKIN' SWEET settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. RANDOM
PLEASURE raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. SHAKE IT CALI lacked early speed, saved
ground through the second turn, reached a contending position into the stretch and failed to gain late. ANALYZE HER STYLE lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. KINGS TABLE showed brief speed, weakened and was eased through the lane. Due to a timer
malfunction the seven furlong time was unavailable.

energy. JADEY AT THE BAR was reserved just off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. CASA BONITA
pressed the pace while racing five-wide and gave way through the final furlong. YOU GOT THIS was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the

Footnotes
STONE CREEK was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and drew off through
the lane with complete authority. A NEW TREND raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and rallied late for the place. OVER EZ was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain late. VIDAKS BACK was bumped at the
start, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and lacked the needed closing response. GAMBLERS GOLD RUSH settled off the leaders early, raced off
the rail through the turn and did not threaten. CANT DO THE DANSE chased the leaders while racing five-wide, angled out in mid-stretch and gave way in
the drive. FORGOTABOUTME was bumped at the break, chased the leaders from between foes, steadied nearing the three-eighths marker, moved
three-wide through the turn and did not menace. MERLOT BRANDO void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MIGHTY
LION was off slow, lagged, raced five-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
MR. BENZ raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and edged away late. QUINCY EXPRESS
was reserved just off the leaders from between foes, lacked racing room from the three-sixteenths pole to the furlong marker, moved between rivals in
mid-stretch and finished with good courage. MR NAVIGATOR settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the leaders with a
furlong to run and gave way late. ADENS DREAM dueled for the lead while racing four-wide and gave way through the final sixteenth. OFFENSIVE lagged
early, raced eighth wide through the turn and found his best stride late. SWAY ROAD disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the
final furlong. LOVER BOY BOB was void of early speed, raced seven-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ALL AMERICAN HERO pressed the pace
from the inside and weakened in the drive.
