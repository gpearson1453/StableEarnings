GRAN ROJO hustled up to press the pacesetter into the turn, continued in close contention into the lane, cleared when straightening then widened to the
wire. COMPLEX JUSTICE set the early pace into the turn then was joined by the winner, stayed with that one into the lane then was no match and settled
for second best. HERBIE DERBIE DAY chased the pace while near the inside through the turn then was kept to the task to be clear for the minor share. GO
RODNEY was along the inside through the turn, moved off the rail and into the two path for the drive and never was a threat. RED PROMISE was done
entering the lane. FORSBERG was done early while in the two or three path.

second best. PEGASUS ON THE GO chased the pace from the three path through the turn, swung into the lane from the four path and moved up for the
minor share. ELZABE'S ON BOARD raced along the inside through the turn, shifted out after entering the lane then weakened. MAJOR WAGER set the

lane then edged clear before the eighth pole and kept on. WANTING chased the pace from the two path, shifted into the four path for the drive, moved
closest to the winner inside the sixteenth pole then was all out to save the place spot. REAL MISS PRADO was in the three path through the turn when well
back, swung into the five path, gained momentum inside the eighth pole, had to alter in then back out to avoid a drifting foe then finished with good energy.
PERFECT SMOKEY EYE was along the inside throughout and turned in an even effort. MAKE OVER along the inside through the turn then offered a mild
gain. MISS FORT was bothered at the start, raced well back into the lane then rallied along the rail. CECILIA'S HOPE was forced inward a couple of paths
at the start, rushed four wide through the turn to contend and gain the lead, came into the lane from the four or five path, drifted about through the final
sixteenth and was empty late. PASSING ON BY set the pace along the inside into late turn then faded through the lane. PRIME N PROPER was in the
three path through the turn and steadily lost ground.

Footnotes
DAY IN THE COUNTRY pressed the pacesetter two wide into mid-turn, inched to the front in late turn, cleared into the lane, widened then was kept to the
task while drifting out slowly through the last part. CATIPARI chased the pace along the inside through mid-turn, angled three wide entering the lane, had
aim on the winner while straightening but could not gain while finishing clear for the place spot. EL PIQUIN set the early pace while near the inside, could
not keep up with the winner entering the lane then was kept to the task to save the show spot. GOOSE DOWN GREY trailed the field through the turn while
in the two path, continued in that path into the lane then offered little threat. SCORSESE was off to an awkward start and was hustled up to contend, swung
four wide into the lane then tired. SKINNERSBURG was in the four or five path through the turn and tired through the lane.

Footnotes
TUFFER THAN TUFF quickly cleared on the lead while racing in the two path, continued on a clear lead into the lane, widened to the eighth pole then was
kept to the task while holding the diminishing advantage to the wire. SUDDEN SHIFT chased the pace from the two or three path through the turn, came
into the lane from the three path then kept on well to be closing in late. FASHION NUGGET was unhurried early while off the rail, advanced through the
three or four path into the lane, straightened in the five path and steadily gained to the end. BRAVO EXPRESS chased the winner from along the inside
through the turn and into the lane then weakened late. MANUELITO was never a serious threat while racing just off the rail through the turn and into the
lane although did show some late interest. EXPRESSED was never a factor while saving ground. PARKER was never in it while in the three path. JOE
COOL chased inside then was done approaching the lane.

ELITE ATTRACTION pressed the early pace two wide into the turn, took a clear lead into the lane then drew away. JUJU BUG chased the pace from the
two path through the turn and into the lane, could not gain on the top one but was kept to the task to save the place spot. EMBROILED was along the inside
through the turn then moved up from off the rail while not a serious threat. SEXY PORK CHOP was in the two path through the turn, swung into the lane
from the five path and offered a mild gain while passing a couple. HALO AND LACE stalked the pace from the three path into the lane, had aim into the lane
then flattened out approaching the sixteenth pole. FUN KEY TOWN was never a factor while in the three path. FOOTBALL MOM was along the inside
through the turn when never far back then tired. STOPSHOPINGKAREN set the early pace along the rail, dueled with the winner in mid-turn then was empty
after straightening in the lane.

Footnotes
TAPIT'S SPIRIT vied for the lead along the inside into the lane, continued to duel after straightening in the lane then gamely held safe. RING OF FIRE was
in the two or three path through the far turn, swung into the lane from the four path and was slowly gaining to the end. WEST WARPATH hopped badly at
the start, raced in the two or three path through the turn, angled into the seven path and was flying late. ROUNDER chased the pace from the three path
into the lane then showed energy late. KNICKS FRONT chased the pace along the inside, bid three wide into the lane then faltered inside the eighth pole. B
TROUBLE set the early pace while under pressure, pressed into the lane then weakened. QUALITY HOUR was never a factor along the inside. BOB'S
CALLING was never a factor while in the three path through the turn. REAL MAN was outrun along the inside.
