Footnotes
FOOTHILL stalked the pacesetter in the two path, applied pressure at the seven-sixteenths pole, headed rival a quarter mile out, dueled through the stretch
and inched away late to prove best. RAILSPLITTER set the pace from inside, headed by FOOTHILL at the quarter pole, dueled from inside through the
stretch, got outkicked in the final sixteenth but proved a game second. HOOP DREAM broke out and bumped rival at the start, tracked the speed from
inside, two wide up the backstretch, moved to the rail around the far turn then came two wide into the stretch, chased three wide through the drive and
gained ground late. DR. HOFFMAN unhurried in the beginning, traveled in the two path around the clubhouse turn, moved to the rail and remained inside to
the stretch, steered out in the stretch and came with a mild late bid. BRAZILIAN SUMMER got bumped from inside at the start, saved ground along the
fence to the stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong. FULL DRAW in range through the early stages while outside a rival, came three wide into the
stretch and weakened. MEADWAY went three wide around the first turn, tracked outside a rival, entered the far turn four wide then moved down to the three
path and weakened in the drive. SHUSTER bumped both sides leaving the gate settled between runners early then outside a rival on the backstretch,
angled out into the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SHEZAGHOST set the pace inside of WHISTLER'S STYLE, met the bid from that rival at the five-sixteenths, kicked clear nearing the stretch then drew off
under a tap of right-handed urging and strong handling. WHISTLER'S STYLE pressed from outside, put in a mild bid around the far turn, could not sustain
the momentum leaving the bend and churned on to prove second best. LADY CROCKER stumbled leaving the gate, pulled leaving the first turn and early
on the backstretch, stalked from inside to the lane, could not summon the needed rally and kept on for a clear third. EYES OPEN stalked outside the top
pair, traveled three wide to the stretch and faded. WILD RIDE steadied between soon after the start, drifted out a bit into the first turn, angled out into the
backstretch and raced widest, came back to the rail for the second bend, entered the stretch two wide, steered out at the top of the lane and never
threatened.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT DIVA established the front from inside, challenged around the far turn and relinquished control past the quarter pole, fought back and regained
control in the stretch and prevailed over the runner-up. RHYTHM AND GRACE was up close outside the leader, bid near the five-sixteenths pole, took
control past the quarter pole, battled with MIDNIGHT DIVA through the stretch, drifted in nearing the sixteenth pole then drifted back out and missed. CIDER
APPLE (GB) was forced out by inner rival at the start, reserved in the two path in the early stages, swung out widest into the stretch and finished well to earn
the show honors. MISS BELLA CIAO stalked from inside, tipped out entering the stretch, lacked room behind the top pair and angled out with a sixteenth to
go but found that clear path taken again when RHYTHM AND GRACE drifted out late. WITCH MOON stalked between foes then outside a rival, asked at
the three-eighths, came four wide into the stretch, stayed within striking distance in the final furlong but could not find the needed late kick. ASSIGNATION
tucked inside and saved ground through both turns but lacked a rally. ARISTEIA came out at the start, tracked outside a pair of rivals, trailed the field
leaving the far turn and had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
TIZ TOFFEE tracked off the rail then angled to the inside, saved ground through the turn, came out and bumped LADY ON ICE entering the stretch, rallied
outside the top pair and took control mid-stretch, drifted out a bit while battling with LADY ON ICE and held gamely. LADY ON ICE vied three deep up the
backstretch, chased four wide around the turn, got bumped by TIZ TOFFEE entering the stretch, rallied outside that rival while getting floated out a bit and
could not get by. VANGOGO broke out and bumped UNO TROUBLE MAKER, dueled inside that rival to the furlong grounds, drifted out and brushed UNO
TROUBLE MAKER late and edged that rival for third. UNO TROUBLE MAKER got bumped by VANGOGO at the start, dueled between rivals then outside
VANGOGO while three wide, could not match the top pair in the final furlong, was brushed late by VANGOGO and lost the show. GEMMA ROYAL attended
the pace four deep, chased the leaders five to four wide around the turn, then weakened in the drive. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED
THAT ALTHOUGH TIZ TOFFEE CAME OUT AND BUMPED LADY ON ICE ENTERING THE STRETCH, THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A
DISQUALFICATION AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

GREGORIAN CHANT (GB) settled along the inside, angled out on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied widest and proved best. BOMBARD sped
to the front from inside, responded when challenged around the turn, turned away foe nearing the furlong grounds, ceded the lead to GREGORIAN CHANT
mid-stretch but stayed on gamely to the wire. CHAOS THEORY tracked from the two path, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, finished willingly
and gained the show. LOUD MOUTH stalked from inside, tipped out into the stretch, lacked room and steadied off heels at the eighth pole, kept to task in
deep stretch and filled out the superfecta. CHASIN MUNNY up close early outside the pacesetter, launched a bid at the five-sixteenths pole but flattened in
the final furlong.

STORM SEEKER stalked in the two path, moved to the rail midway around the turn then exited two wide, took over and cleared mid-stretch and lasted at
the wire. MINISTER SHANE tracked off the inside, came three wide into the stretch, dug in late outside STORM SEEKER and narrowly missed.
FERRARIANO stalked from inside, was in tight and steadied at the five-sixteenths pole, angled out in the stretch and finished willingly. HEAD FOR
BUSINESS dueled for the lead from inside, cleared around the turn, lost command past the eighth pole and weakened late. AUSPICIOUS STYLE traveled
outside a rival in mid-pack, angled four wide leaving the turn and lacked a rally. IRONDALE tossed his head and came away slow, raced along the inside in
mid-pack, angled three wide into the stretch, came in at the top of the stretch and could not rally. BACKYARD BRAWL got bumped by BARACKO at the
start. BARACKO broke in and bumped with rivals from both sides at the start, went three wide into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend and failed to
threaten. COUNT TOLSTOY dueled for the lead from outside to the turn, could not keep pace around the bend and faded in the lane. SEATTLE
BREAKOUT broke in and bumped rival, jumped the track crossing surfaces early, angled to the inside, saved ground to the stretch and was never a factor.
MAGNIFICENT RED jumped the track crossing surfaces early, eased around the turn, pulled up in upper stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
EL DIABLO ROJO sat off the pace, entered the turn three wide, angled to the rail around the bend, came out in upper stretch and drove clear. SINGLE ME
OUT raced two wide then came out into the stretch, rallied from outside and proved second best. TETON VALLEY brushed with UNMASKED at the start,
set the pace inside of TIZ A SPEED BOMB, cleared that rival around the turn, led into the furlong grounds but weakened late. UNMASKED brushed TETON
VALLEY at the start, chased from inside, angled out into the lane, came out and bumped rival in upper stretch and kept on through the late stages to earn a
minor award. CAERULEAN traveled off the rail while in range, went two wide into the turn, angled to the inside then tipped out into the stretch and flattened
out in the final furlong. INGEST forwardly placed outside the top pair, chased four wide into the lane, got bumped by UNMASKED in upper stretch and
weakened. TIZ A SPEED BOMB pressed the pace from outside, failed to match strides midway around the turn and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
SECOND AVENUE took control early and crossed over to the inside, received pressure around the turn, cleared MAGGIE'S MAGIC in upper stretch, lugged
out in the lane and held well. MISS LADY ANN chased outside a rival, three wide into the stretch, moved outside the winner and kept gaining to the wire.
MAGGIE'S MAGIC brushed at the start, closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid outside on the turn, lost contact in upper stretch and held the show. FULL
ECLIPSE tracked outside rivals up the backstretch, took the turn four wide and kept on to earn a minor award. COMMAS SAVE LIVES stalked the pace
from inside to the stretch and lacked the needed response. TRAFFIC STOPPER broke out and brushed rival at the start, entered the stretch two to three
wide and failed to rally. RUN LIKE KONA chased in the two path to the stretch and also lacked a rally. SECRET MANEUVER traveled a bit off the rail or two
wide on the turn then angled out in upper stretch and never made an impact. SOPHIE ANTOINETTE chased five wide around the turn and came up empty.
KAYGO steadied soon after the start, trailed the field into the turn, went four to five wide around the bend and failed to menace.
