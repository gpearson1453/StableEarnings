FULSOME stalked the pace early three wide, made a bid nearing the lane, was under a long drive in the upper stretch then drew away in the final stages.
ETHICAL JUDGEMENT set the pace early along the inside, was put under a full drive along the far turn, raced along the three path into the lane, was under
a long drive in the upper stretch then gave in. AVIANO came out at the start, chased the pace early, was in the six path into the lane and moved up in the
stretch run. NOTARY tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. HARD STRIKE was bumped and bothered
at the start, no factor. BRITISH ROYALTY was done early, eased in the stretch and was walked off after the race.

Footnotes
DON'TSHOWWEAKNESS set the pace from the outset along the inside, was off the rail into the lane, drew clear down the lane and held off rivals in the
final stages. ROGUE ELEMENT stalked the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane, made a late bid but did not have enough in
the final stages. BOLD VICTORY raced back early on along the inside, was off the rail into the lane, rallied in the stretch and was gaining in the late stages.
LAUNCH PAD raced back early on, was in the seven path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch and finished willingly in the final stages. LEMON AND
DIEM hopped at the start and raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. THE FLASCHE was in the three path
into the lane and improved position. PERFECT PAINTING was in the five path into the lane while no factor. HE WHO DARES WINS tracked the pace early
on, was in the five path into the lane and empty down the lane. BEAU BOOK was never a factor. KING ZION was through after a half while on an inside trip.
MIDLANER had early speed then folded up.

Footnotes
WEST WILL POWER stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the dueling pair into the far turn, swept past those foes passing the three furlong pole, drew
off turning for home, and widened under very confident handling through the lane. LORD GUINNESS saved ground far off of the pace, commenced an
advance turning for home, shifted outside of the early pace setter entering the lane while proving no match for the eventual winner, then reached place in
the late stagess. PAYNE set the pace inside of ALMASHRIQ, dueled with that foe into the far turn, but offered little resistance to WEST WILL POWER
around that bend, maintained place through midstretch, but lost that position late. IN LOVE (BRZ) tracked the pace while four wide around both turns, but
made little impact. ALMASHRIQ vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. UNCLE KICK pressed the pace
three wide, but weakened at the half mile pole, was eased through the lane, and jogged across the wire.

SILVER DUST hopped a bit and was off slowly, recovered to press the pace setter two wide around the first turn, inched closer to duel for the lead into the
far turn, battled gamely through midstretch while clinging to a narrow advantage, and resiliently held to the wire. NIGHT OPS tracked three wide, but came
under all out pressure into the far turn, got floated four wide around that bend, chased from between horses through the lane, surged late approaching the
wire, but missed. BEAU LUMINARIE stalked along the inside, took the far turn in the two to three path while shifting outside of the embattled duo, but only
produced a mild kick, bid at the furlong grounds, but hung, failed to reach the leader, and got outfinished by an outer foe for place. SPRAWL set the pace
along the inside, dueled inside of SILVER DUST around the far turn, dug in gamely inside of rivals through midstretch, but yielded late. TREASURE TROVE
trailed, took the far turn in the four to five path, grinded away outside of foes through the final furlong, but did not have enough to menace.

Footnotes
CHANGE OF CONTROL tracked from midpack three wide and outside of foes, shifted to the five path entering the lane, commenced a rally through the final
furlong, and wore down the clear leader approaching the wire. INTO MYSTIC stalked close up to the pace along the inside, assumed control after inheriting
an advantage entering the lane, drew off under her own power, but came under driving pressure inside the furlong pole as CHANGE OF CONTROL gave
chase, but was worn down by that foe inside the final sixteenth. JAKARTA prompted the pace setter while being kept in the three path by that rival, but was
outkicked by a ground saving foe at the quarter pole, gave chase through the lane, then held show from IN GOOD SPIRITS to the wire. IN GOOD SPIRITS
stalked two wide and from between horses, chased through upper stretch without making progress, then faded passing the furlong pole. FASHIONABLE
LADY saved ground off of the pace, but never got involved. ELLE Z set the pace in the two path, but was headed by an inner rival at the quarter pole,
chased through upper stretch, but weakened through the final furlong. OOOH BARRACUDA was off awkwardly, and outrun.

Footnotes
KING FURY lied far off of the pace in the four to three path around the first turn, navigated inside into the backstretch, advanced to midpack passing the five
furlong pole, glided up behind the leaders into the far turn, split those foes two wide at the five sixteenths pole, assumed command entering the lane, drew
off passing the quarter pole, and held sway under driving pressure to the wire. UNBRIDLED HONOR trailed along the inside, advanced along the rail into
and around the far turn to be behind the leaders turning for home, swung four wide and outside of those foes entering the lane, then stayed on to claim
place in the late stages. STARRININMYDREAMS achieved stalking position while shifting down to the two path around the first turn, tracked the leaders
from the three path into the far turn, got floated to the four path while attempting a bid but also getting outkicked by KING FURY at the five sixteenths pole,
then chased that foe through the lane, but lost place inside the final sixteenth. PROXY lied of of the pace in the three path around the first turn, tracked from
the four to five path around the far turn, then stayed on willingly for a minor share, but failed to threaten. NOBLE REFLECTION set the pace along the
inside, met a pair of bids while repelling his pressing counterparts at the five sixteenths pole, failed to keep pace entering the lane, then weakened in upper
stretch. IT'S MY HOUSE chased from midpack two wide, but failed to factor. SWIFTSURE pressed the pace two wide, then weakened between horses at
the five sixteenths pole. HOCKEY DAD tracked from midpack along the inside, but weakened into the backstretch and was done early. BEZOS got a bit
fractious in the gates waiting for the last horse to be loaded, chased the fast pace three wide under steady urging, but weakened into the far turn, and was
eased through the lane.

Footnotes
JULIET FOXTROT (GB) inched clear from the field around the first turn, managed an uncontested margin while in hand and staying in the two path,
widened her advantage when let out a notch passing the quarter pole, held sway under driving pressure through midstretch, and was kept to task to the
wire. TAMAHERE (FR) stalked along the inside, got a bit keen along the rail into the first turn, settled into a comfortable stride down the backstretch, tracked
from behind the clear leader around the far turn, shifted outside of that one entering the lane, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, then chased her home
while safely holding place. LA SIGNARE (FR) stalked two wide, but a bit keen into the first turn, but came under a drive between horses into the far turn,
failed to keep pace with those rivals around the bend, but cut the corner turning for home, and stayed on to reclaim show in the final furlong. ETOILE (FR)
trailed early on, took the far turn in the four to five path while attempting a rally, but only stayed on mildly, and failed to menace while achieving a minor
share. MAXIM RATE tracked from midpack two wide around the first turn, shifted four wide into the backstretch, made an early move to stalking position
passing the nine sixteenths marker, held chasing position three wide around the far turn, but flattened out and yielded between horses in upper stretch.
MICHELINE tracked from midpack along the inside, got a bit keen into the backstretch, shifted three wide to settle, but backed out in tight quarters between
foes at the nine sixteenths marker took the far turn in the three to four path, but tired turning for home.

Footnotes
STAGE RAIDER stalked the leading duelers from the three path, ranged up to them turning for home, swept past in upper stretch, drew off approaching the
furlong grounds, greenly ducked in on his left lead at the sixteenth pole when anticipating right handed pressure, but straightened course and was ridden out
to the wire. HARVARD chased from midpack in the four path, lost ground to the leaders into and around the turn, came into the lane in the five path, but
regained stride in midstretch, stayed on through the lane inside of CRONUS, and prevailed over that foe for place. CRONUS lied far off of the pace, took the
turn in the three path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on outside of foes through the final furlong, but was outfinished by an inner foe for
place. DERBY HOUSE trailed early on, came into the lane two wide, split foes three wide in midstretch, and improved for a minor share. SIX PACK rushed
to duel for the lead outside of WINDCRACKER, but offered little resistance to STAGE RAIDER in upper stretch, then weakened in the final sixteenth, and
lost place approaching the wire. SENSIBLE JIM was reluctant to load, then saved ground far off of the pace around the turn, but to no avail.
WINDCRACKER dueled along the inside, but was no match for the eventual winner in upper stretch, and tired. HOPE AND DIGNITY chased from off of the
pace along the inside, but was done early. ROAD BIBLE chased from midpack in the two path around the turn, and faded through the lane. PRIVATE
NETWORK was never involved. COMPLICATE was outrun.
