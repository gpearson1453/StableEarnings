Footnotes
GOSPEL CARLOTTA settled behind the pacesetting trio along the backstretch, was sent for the drive near the three eights pole, circled rivals five wide
entering the homestretch and rallied for the score. PLAYING WITH JAXS pressed the pace as the outermost of all rivals through the opening half, was well
rated at the top of the homestretch and drifted in near the three sixteenths pole while unable to fend off the late rally of eventual winner. JUSTPLAINJANE
flashed early foot and was in a spirited tussle with TAYLORS VISION through the opening half, led the field from a two path pose at upper stretch but failed
to fend off the late charge of top pair. TAYLOR'S VISION broke alertly and exchanged command along the backstretch, trekked three wide through the turn,
but was unable to match strides with rivals in final furlong. EXCETERA lacked a response in crucial stages after being unhurried and saving ground early.
WOW WOW ITS MAGIC came away a step slow, rushed to dispute pace at conclusion of backstretch then tired in the late going. VALENTINA LIL was
reserved in the early going, tucked to save ground and failed to threaten. LADY KICKS trailed throughout.

Footnotes
IM JUSTA BACHELOR pressed the pace from along the inside through the first call, joined the pacesetting duo through the turn, shared command as the
inner most rival at upper stretch and refused to be denied in the stretch duel by. ETTERBAY UCKLAY , who set the pace for the opening half as the
outermost rival before losing the lengthy stretch duel. BEST YEAR YET settled into second fight between rivals then rallied mildly for show. CATCH THIS
STAR tired in crucial stages after setting the pace from between rivals. RUNFORUSRUN saved ground to no avail. MAFIA DON was reserved along the
inside through the opening half and failed to menace in the late going. DENS D ORO was unhurried in early stages before angling out to widest of all rivals
near the seven sixteenths pole and losing ground to front runners. RED FLASH flashed early speed and led the field between calls along the backstretch
before eclipsing in the homestretch. T BRADY failed to threaten from a five wide stance.
