Footnotes
RELISHMENT broke sharply, was urged to dictate the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail into the backstretch, repelled a rival's bid racing
through the far turn and drove clear through the stretch. WHISTLE ME HOME tracked off the first flight between foes, then outside a rival racing through the
backstretch and continued with a steady effort to edge a rival for the place honors late. TIP SHEET, in touch attending a rival's pace in the opening half,
pressed the leader on the far turn, shifted inwards losing terms with that foe in upper stretch and gave way. UNSPOILED MOMENTS, reserved along the
inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out three wide entering upper stretch and made some mild progress. TAPSOLUTE angled to the rail racing into the
first turn tracking just off the first flight, but steadily faded racing into the far turn. MISSION DRIVEN tracked just off the second flight racing three wide to the
backstretch and retreated early.

Footnotes
ERIN GO BRAUGH angled inwards to join the pace outside rivals in the opening stages, continued with a steady bid pressing the issue between foes
nearing upper stretch, kicked clear entering the lane and widened the advantage late under pressure. FIFTY CENTS, in touch with the leaders between
rivals in the opening stages, was eased off the pace after the opening three sixteenths while shifting out, was prompted to advance three wide nearing upper
stretch but proved only second best. ROYAL BIZ, brushed at the start while carried out slightly, was urged to the lead a bit off the inside, dueled for
command on the turn into upper stretch and gave way. PLEASANT WISH settled well off the leaders along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out in
upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position. MUST BE A MONSTER broke outwards brushing ROYAL BIZ, angled to the inside tracking
the leaders from just out of striking distance, then continued evenly between foes into the lane. EAGLE KEEPER tracked off the first flight outside a rival
racing into the turn, angled inside nearing upper stretch but proved empty in the drive. RENEESINHEAVEN broke outwards, then was held up momentarily
in tight quarters just after the start and never gained contention. SARATOGA DANCER trailed throughout.

SHALL RETURN tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the turn, was prompted to advance while being fanned five wide midstretch but continued
with a steady late response to just edge GLORY ROLL on the wire under right handed pressure and steady handling. The latter, in touch with the first flight
three wide prompting the pace racing to the turn, dueled past midstretch, edged forward between calls late but just failed to contain the winner. CELESTIAL
ORB tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch to bid between foes late but was outkicked by the top
pair. PASSION'S IMAGE, urged inside rivals pressing the pace from the outset to upper stretch, dueled past midstretch and gave out near the sixteenth

Footnotes
VOLADOR was rated inside foes dropping off the leaders racing to the first turn, switched out midway through the backstretch to race four wide into the far
turn, came under stout pressure to advance in that path to upper stretch, gained terms with the first flight nearing midstretch and continued in a prolonged
drive to finish on even terms with SNIPER SIS at the wire under firm right handed pressure. The latter was urged three deep between foes to gain a forward
placing racing to the first turn, tracked just off the first flight between foes through the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn to bid three wide between
racing into upper stretch and struck the front in time to finish on even terms for the win. RIDGELYSREDHOT raced outside foes just off the first flight into the
first turn, gained a position stalking just outside the leaders on the backstretch, was urged to advance three deep entering the second bend, moved to wrest
the advantage from between foes nearing upper stretch, held sway on a narrow advantage racing into the lane and resisted the top pair to late stages.
TEGLA, urged between foes just off the inside disputing the pace into the backstretch, pressed the inside rivals racing into the far turn and gave way nearing
midstretch. MEMORABLE ANGEL, caught five wide racing into the first turn while being urged to terms with the first flight, shifted inwards on the backstretch
to force the pace outside a rival, dueled between foes into the second bend and gave way nearing upper stretch. COUNTESS JESSICA, urged to a forward
placing inside rivals racing into the first turn, faded after a half. PLAYIN DISCO, held up avoiding tight quarters in the opening stages, angled out five wide
racing into the backstretch and never mounted a serious bid. WILL TAKE ROSES, restless in the gate, briefly contested the pace four wide between foes
into the first turn but dropped out early.

Footnotes
DANCE PANTS, forwardly placed along the inside, switched outside the pacesetter entering the backstretch stalking the leaders between foes, was
prompted to challenge the leader on the far turn, pressed the issue outside that foe in a prolonged drive past midstretch but went clear late under strong
handling. ESTILO VARONIL tracked the leaders outside a rival in the second flight, was fanned four wide midway through the backstretch, continued
outside a rival on the far turn, shifted out three wide in the closing stages and prevailed for the place honors late. KING RAMOS was rated off the second
flight between foes racing to the backstretch, angled inwards on the far turn steadily gaining contention, then continued willingly inside foes in the closing
stages while just missing for second. BEACH WARRIOR sped to the lead, then angled to the rail once gaining a clear advantage on the first turn, dueled
inside a rival to regain the advantage between calls entering the far turn, continued to dispute the issue inside the winner past midstretch but yielded late.
DREAMING OF AUDREY settled last, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. YOUNG THOMAS, reserved between
foes to the far turn, never gained contention. AGENT MULGANNON tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch and steadily faded
racing into the far turn. CHOPPER settled outside foes in early stages, made brief progress three wide racing into the far turn but came up empty in the
drive. ALL FOOLS DAY broke slowly, switched out four wide racing into the backstretch and failed to menace. WROTE IN STONE switched outside the
leaders while sent with an early move to challenge for command racing into the backstretch, was spent early.

Footnotes
NO SNIVELING angled to the rail in the opening stages while being rated inside foes to the backstretch, gradually drew into contention saving ground on the
far turn, shifted out to split foes racing into upper stretch and took over in late stages under firm handling. DREAMING OF PARIS broke out bumping a rival,
angled inwards tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance leading the second flight on a narrow margin, advanced to challenge shifting three wide
nearing upper stretch, couldn't match the winner's kick but continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors late. STORMY MUSIC, forwardly
placed stalking a rival's pace in the opening half, took over racing into the far turn, resisted the leaders entering the lane but yielded to the top pair late.
STRONG GEM, bumped at the start, settled last to the backstretch, swung out five wide in upper stretch and gained some position while making no
impression. MOTHERWELL, reserved well off the leaders a bit off the rail, gained some position three wide between foes racing into the lane but lacked the
needed final kick. STUY TOWN BABY tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch and steadily faded.
TREASURED INFO sprinted to the lead along the rail, set the pace on a clear margin to the far turn and abruptly gave out nearing upper stretch. CHARGE
IT JENN tracked off the second flight in early stages, was caught four wide nearing the far turn and soon retreated. STRATOSPHERA, caught wide leaving
the chute, then racing to the first turn, dropped out early.

MEANASASNAKE was urged to dispute the pace inside foes in the opening stages, pulled her way clear racing into the turn, held sway on a commanding
advantage into upper stretch and was kept to firm encouragement. RACHEL'S WISH, unhurried four wide between foes in the opening stages dropping well
off the pacesetter, was prompted to commence a steady, three wide advance racing through the turn to upper stretch and closed the gap late while proving
only second best. QUEEN ASHY BABY, caught five wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards to advance between foes nearing the lane and prevailed for
a share. TETON THAI, forwardly placed between foes, was rated off the first flight while angling to the rail racing into the turn but had no closing bid.
STARSHIP PRANKSTER switched off the inside in early stages to track the leaders three, then four wide into the lane, offered no rally.
FIDDLERSHOTPLEASUR ducked out at the start, was taken in hand while angling to the inside early but proved no threat. THIRSTYFORAMIRACLE broke
inwards hitting the gate while getting away slowly and failed to menace thereafter. ENOUGH KISSES was urged prompting the pacesetter in the opening
stages, gave way early, was outdistanced racing into the stretch but walked off under her own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
WILLING TO SPEED was rated off the first flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily gained contention along the rail entering the far turn, split
foes just off the inside nearing upper stretch to wrest the advantage and went clear under strong handling. FLY NIGHTLY was rated nearest the inside, then
between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, was urged to advance while a sharp move three wide between foes racing into upper stretch and
proved best of the others. RUDIGER was settled in the last flight along the inside early, shifted out to race between foes in the last flight through the
backstretch, was prompted to split foes three wide into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share. ROUGH NIGHT angled to the rail
racing into the first turn tracking behind the second flight, gained position inside foes racing into upper stretch but had no final kick. THE CURT FOX (GB)
settled outside foes in early stages, advanced five wide, then four wide to upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. HOT AND HEAVY, urged inside foes
disputing the pace from the outset, dueled for command into the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. BOOMIN GOOSE tracked the leaders three wide
in second flight, then steadily faded into the far turn. NOTORIOUS NICK joined the pace four wide in the opening stages but was through after a half. NEW
JERSEY JOHN vied between foes pressing the pace to the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. CHIEF WHITE SOX, urged prompting the pace three
wide between foes racing to the backstretch, gave way early.

AIN'T WASTING TIME stumbled, then was bumped soundly at the start, was righted to track off the first flight between foes, angled inwards nearing the turn
advancing in tandem with several rivals to bid for command between foes approaching upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage entering upper stretch and
held COMPANY STORE in a prolonged drive under firm handling. The latter, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the
turn, advanced in tandem with several rivals to bid for command three wide between foes into upper stretch but was outkicked. PRETTY CHITU, forwardly
placed four wide tracking the leaders in early stages, was urged to challenge in that path nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. SIR HIGGINS
sprinted to the lead, then angled to the inside nearing the turn and gave way into upper stretch. IMPERIAL IVOR settled last along the inside in the opening
quarter, switched off the inside nearing upper stretch, steadied in tight quarters entering the lane and passed some tiring rivals late. FREE FLAYME tracked
off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn and faded into upper stretch. SOUL REFLECTION broke inwards bumping the eventual winner, was
righted to track three wide between foes racing into the turn and steadily faded. DISTURBINGTHEPEACE settled between foes and dropped out early.

Footnotes
FOX ROX ducked out at the start crossing into the path of SOLITARY JACK bumping that rival, quickly recovered to go clear, set the pace on a comfortable
margin racing well off the rail into the bend and held sway to the end under steady pressure. SOUR KICKS tracked off the second flight along the inside
racing through the backstretch, switched out three, then four wide into upper stretch and proved best of the others. GREAT BLAKE tracked the pacesetter
three wide as part of the second flight, shifted inwards entering the turn and faded into the stretch. DERBY CITY tracked off the second flight racing three,
then four wide into the turn and finished evenly in that path late. ARCHIVERO, urged pursuing the pacesetter between foes racing through the backstretch,
angled to the inside entering the turn and faded into the lane. REBOUNDER, forced wide at the start, never gained contention. SOLITARY JACK, bumped,
then shut off at the start, never gained contention. LIZ MORE BOY settled near the inside early and proved no threat. ED'S DOG worked his way to the
inside tracking off the second flight and faded into the stretch.
