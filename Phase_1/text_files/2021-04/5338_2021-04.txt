Footnotes
BULLS EYE BETTY moved up outside QUEEN OF GOLD going up the backstretch to bid with a rival into the far turn, drew clear into the lane under urging
and drew off the remainder. LOTS OF SHADE moved up inside to bid with the winner nearing the far turn, shortened stride in that bend but continued to be
clear for the place. ORFELINA stalked the pace three or four wide to bid into the far turn and weakened into the lane. LADY EVERLEY was climbing into the
first turn and came out to follow the pace four wide then weakened in the far turn. WILDFIRE SIS bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground and was
always back. JUST SEND HER was never a factor. QUEEN OF GOLD bumped with a rival at the start, showed some brief foot from about the three path
and gave way in the far turn.

Footnotes
GIGGLES AND SMOKE stalked the leaders three wide, moved inside to rally up the rail in the lane and moved clear under steady handling. SYLVIA'S
ROCKET was on the pace outside AVABELL early, moved in a bit to race about the two path, remained off the rail into the lane and could not handle the
winner's late run. AVABELL was inside SYLVIA'S ROCKET through the first turn, angled out turning into the backstretch and contested the pace to upper
stretch then was outfinished for the place while holding third. BELLE STRIKE stalked the leaders three and four wide, went evenly in the lane and was well
clear for her position. P R GIRL CRUSH was not a threat. TREPI'S TRPL CROWN was always back. STRIKE PERFECTION trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ALEUTIAN HARBOUR stalked the early leaders three wide, moved inside the lead group to bid going to the far turn, dueled GASPERGOU through the lane
and got the advantage late. GASPERGOU was well off the inside in the three or four path throughout, resisted when challenged in the lane but could not
contain the winner late while just holding the place. FLANAGAN stalked the pace three wide, moved up into the lane, angled out and closed too late.
AUCTIONEER was hung five wide outside GASPERGOU contested the early pace and weakened. DRAX had no rally racing outside. ARCH SEEKER was
hung six wide in the lead group through the opening half mile and tired. CALOGERO saved ground and gave way after a half.

EVERYDAYISAGOODDAY stalked the pace saving ground, rallied up the rail through the lane and was in time. OUR HALF FIRST was off the pace racing
outside, angled six wide into the lane and closed well late to gain the place. HESALITTLE SHADY broke inward, stalked the pace four wide, remained in
good position but could not produce the needed late rally. ATWATER was just off the early pace three wide and was outfinished for position. LAST CALL
LEROY trailed early, was fanned eight wide into the stretch and moved up. JUST WING IT was on the early pace just off the inside and weakened in the far
turn. BACK TO BLACK was on the pace to upper stretch from about the three path and weakened. DOYOUKNOWMYNAME was in reach of the pace three
or four wide and lacked a rally. COLONEL GRAY failed to threaten and was fanned seven wide into the lane. MACHO SANCHO was not a factor.

pace to late in the far turn about the three or four path and weakened into the lane. OIL COLONY was angled out leaving the first turn, moved up four wide
in the far turn but could not threaten in the lane. FERRIC was hung five wide in the first turn, settled four wide and failed to mount a bid. PACK'N IRON was
not a threat. DESPOTIC saved ground just off the early pace and weakened. DOUBLETROUBLE BEAR trailed the field four wide.

Footnotes
MY BOY LOLLIPOP was angled out heading up the backstretch to bid four wide in the far turn and move clear then drew off while kept to task. RUNTECH
tracked the early leader three wide, bid into the far turn then could not go with the winner nearing the lane. SILVER MAKER moved to contention three and
four wide going to the far turn but weakened through that bend. GONE PREACHIN moved up four and five wide to reach striking position but weakened into
the lane. DRASTIC stalked the pace four wide and tired. PETE AND REPETE saved ground to the far turn, angled out into the lane but could not threaten.
STAR OF STARS saved ground in reach of the early pace and tired. TROUBLEWITHACURVE made the early pace about the two or three path and gave
way in the far turn.
