Footnotes
BIZZAR BROWN tucked behind the early pacesetters to save ground, angled out near the quarter pole, was asked for a rally and split foes near the three
sixteenths pole and finished under a strong drive for the score. GRACIE G pressed the pace from between rivals at the conclusion of backstretch, gained
command at upper stretch, was in a stretch duel with LUCKILY near the eighth pole, then was caught in final strides by the eventual winner. LUCKILY
settled into a stalking pose as the outermost of three rivals in the second flight, maintained that three wide stance at upper stretch, locked into a stretch duel
with GRACIE G, then gave way to top pair in the final sixteenth. MISS TYRO rallied mildly to improve placing after being unhurried early and swinging wide
through the turn. D R C'S ARM CANDY motored to the front and set the pace for the opening half from a two path stance before tiring in the closing strides.
CRYSTAL CODE saved ground to no avail. HUSHED gave chase while trekking along the two path and was of mild menace. D' CINNAMON GIRL steadily
faded in the homestretch after pressing the pace from between rivals in the early going. TELL ME BOO BOO passed tiring rival. SHEZALITTLEHAZEY
settled into mid pack, lacked a late bid, and was no threat in the end.

INCLUDING ELLIE was off a step slow then rushed to contention to take the lead after a quarter and drew off under light urging. HARPERS VISION stalked
the pace from the three path then made a bid going into the stretch but was no match for the winner. ORPHAN ANGIE was the early speed before the first
call then was well place in the three path and tired in the stretch. BAJA RATTLE broke alertly with ORPHAN ANGIE then chased the leaders from the two
path and weakened on the turn. AVAH'S SONG failed to menace. DIRTY DANCER trailed from the inside and was not a factor.

settled behind the pacesetter along the backstretch, swung wide through the turn to advance position and proved second best in the end. PUNCHING
WILDLY stalked the pacesetter from between rivals but was unable to match strides in final furlong. RUN BUDDA RUN failed to sustain bid after pressing
the pace from a three wide pose. NORTHCOUNTY STROLL travelled wide, gave chase, and had no late gain. SHANNON'S QUEST failed to threaten after
stuttering at the start and losing all chance. SILVER STAR OKIE trailed from outset.

Footnotes
TARUCA was reserved along the backstretch, swung wide through the turn and circled all rivals then rallied with a strong finish for the victory. PROUD
MOMENTS settled into the second flight while travelling four wide, was within striking distance at upper stretch, finished gamely and just missed the score.
BEAU GOSSE rated along the inside, lost ground to pacesetter through the turn, swung to three wide at upper stretch and was outfinished. BABADOOOK
was unhurried early before tucking to rail through the bend and rallying mildly along the inside to improve placing. ONE SON OF A CHIEF rushed from
outset to share command while trekking the two path, led the field into homestretch then tired in final furlong. INTIMIDATING was a step slow into stride,
travelled along the three path through the bend and improved placing with late interest. BURTNJOE passed tiring rivals to end a three wide trip. R FAST
LIFE pressed the pace while four wide in the opening half then eclipsed in crucial stages. CHUKKA saved ground to no avail. GEAUXCRO faded rapidly
after flashing early speed and leading the field through the first call.
