Footnotes
CUY saved ground outsprinted early, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, rallied steadily to overhaul the leaders from outside, and drew clear
late. TRY ME vied outside BELLA FUTURE, bumped solidly with that rival in midstretch, and saved the place between horses. BELLA FUTURE vied inside
TRY ME, came out under left-hand pressure bumping that one solidly in midstretch, and was nipped for the place. GRAND UNION raced two wide around
the turn, had aim outside the leaders once straightened away for the drive, but did not have enough. ANDRES EDUARDO saved ground throughout, and
lacked the needed rally. MISTER FERNANDO delayed the start difficult to load, but was otherwise not a factor. FIAT LUX raced three to four wide, and
faded coming off the turn. BALTIMORE JACK hit the left side of the gate coming out, then was bumped and forced out by inner rivals, and never got close.
R GUITAR CASINO broke out forcing AWESOME FAMILY into BALTIMORE JACK, and was always outrun. AWESOME FAMILY got forced into
BALTIMORE JACK by R GUITAR CASINO at the break, and was through early. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

TODAYSTHEDAY bumped with ENSIGN PARKER while outside that rival entering the turn, shifted out a bit approaching the stretch, rallied determinedly
and was up outside late. MR TINGLES broke on top but was wrangled back off the leaders soon after, saved ground into the turn, moved out three wide
with a bid into the stretch, battled for command through the closing stages but was outfinished. EXCHANGE DAY came in after the start bumping ENSIGN
PARKER into SPEND BENJAMINS, vied outside HEAVENLY BLESSING, got the best of that dispute past the eighth-pole and ran on stubbornly inside the
top two. SPEND BENJAMINS got bumped by ENSIGN PARKER soon after the start, lagged well back for three furlongs, split horses a sixteenth out and
finished willingly. JACKSON STRONG had aim in the four-path coming off the turn, but failed to mount a serious challenge. ENSIGN PARKER was bumped
into SPEND BENJAMINS by EXCHANGE DAY shortly after the start, saved ground into the turn and bumped with TODAYSTHEDAY, and could not
threaten. GODS BLESSING was always outrun. HEAVENLY BLESSING dueled inside EXCHANGE DAY, and weakened a furlong from home.

Footnotes
UNCORK THE BOTTLE settled off the pace outside, raced in the three path around the turn, angled widest in upper stretch, closed outside and was up late.
KALU set the pace in the two path, dueled inside around the turn and finished gamely between rivals to hold second. BENEFACTOR settled off the pace
two wide, angled out in upper stretch, rallied between foes but was outkicked. ALL AROUND saved ground off the pace, cut the corner into the lane,
reached contention in midstretch and evened out inside. SOUTH SEA pressed the pace in the three path, dueled around the turn, battled on past the eighth
pole then weakened. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN broke in a tangle and trailed outside.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN LAVA vied early inside MAJESTIC STREET, let that one go and tracked from close range up the backstretch, moved off the rail with a rebid from
outside turning for home, and drove clear through the furlong grounds. MAJESTIC STREET broke outward, went up to contest the early pace outside
CAPTAIN LAVA, cleared inside with the lead up the backstretch, could not withstand CAPTAIN LAVA in upper stretch but held for the place. BORKAN
alternated between the rail and two-path on the turns, advanced into the stretch with aim outside the leaders, but did not have enough. BACKCHAT was
forced out at the start by MAJESTIC STREET, raced three to four wide around the first turn at the back, cut the corner making some progress into the lane,
and ran on evenly late under light urging. FLIGHT TO PARADISE saved ground early, moved out three then four wide after six furlongs, and could not gain.
CREATIVE CLOUD raced three to four wide, and faded approaching the stretch. MAGICAL ADVENTURE was forwardly placed for six furlongs, and tired.
RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
SO LONG CHUCK settled off the early pace between rivals, advanced three wide around the far turn, closed steadily outside of the dueling leaders in the
lane and was up late. FAST LOADED set a pressured pace in the two path, dueled inside of RESIDENT on slight disadvantage through much of the lane,
exchange several light brushes with that foe, stayed on the left lead, regained the lead leaving the eighth pole, won the duel and was run down late.
RESIDENT pressed the pace in the three path, dueled with a slight advantage while exchanging light brushes through the stretch and was outfinished.
STARSHIP APOLLO lacked early speed inside, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths pole and rallied belatedly outside. FLAWLESS MOON chased
the pace two wide and lacked a rally. DR HARLAN steadied inside early, angled out to go four wide around the turn and never threatened.
YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY had brief speed four wide. ESPRESSO CALIENTE played no factor while racing four and five. GNARLY had some speed
between foes and was through early.

LORILOUPIES dueled outside COMP'D, disposed of that rival around the turn, and drove well clear while drifting out in the stretch. TIZ ENOUGH was
outrun for a half-mile, came four wide off the turn, angled in rallying through the furlong grounds and was best of the others. FOLLOW ME MOM saved
ground throughout, and plugged along on the rail to get the show. COMP'D vied inside LORILOUPIES early, could not keep pace after a half-mile, and
faded in the lane. NACHO MAMA broke out bumping MY ASHLEIGH into FOXY MISCHIEF, and never reached contention. MY ASHLEIGH got bumped into
FOXY MISCHIEF by NACHO MAMA at the break, raced three wide and tired after a half. FOXY MISCHIEF became edgy in the gate prior to the start,
bumped with MY ASHLEIGH coming out, and was through early.

Footnotes
NEVERSTOPDREAMING prompted the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. SEIZE THE HAY raced well back
inside early, made progress three wide into the far turn, angled five wide midway around that bend and finished willingly to gain the place in deep stretch.
LEADING FACTOR set the pace along the rail, could not keep pace with the winner nearing the lane, angled out in upper stretch and stayed on to save a
minor award. SHINING THROUGH saved ground off the pace, steadied nearing the lane and improved position inside. COWARDLY ACT hit the starting
gate, raced two wide in midpack, gained three wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. CALL BROS raced off the pace three wide while pulling early,
advanced three wide into the far turn but had no further bids. NORTHBROOK was in range two wide but was through after a half. BODIE CODY never
threatened while racing two wide. ONE EYED JACK steadied into the first turn, saved ground, steadied again nearing the far turn and retreated.

TUNE IN followed behind the leaders for six furlongs near the two-path, kept to task determinedly through a long drive and was up outside WELL DEFINED
in time. WELL DEFINED vied inside CREATE AGAIN to the turn, shook that one off after six furlongs, stayed on his left lead to 50 yards out and could not
hold on. QUENANE was outrun early, came four wide off the turn, rallied mildly and was clearly best of the remainder. SEPTEMBERTEN came under a ride
after five furlongs, moved out five wide into the lane and could not gain. CREATE AGAIN pressed WELL DEFINED from outside, got shaken off around the
turn, and faded. GLORY OF FLORIDA raced three to four wide, and tired approaching the stretch. YOUCANTCATCHCURLIN stumbled at the start and was
off slowly, and never reached contention. LIKE YOU saved ground to no avail. CALABASH was finished early three wide.

preserve the place. CAPTAIN RON raced off the pace two wide, came in and bumped WEEKEND DREAMER near the quarter pole, angled out nearing the
eighth pole, continued on the left lead and rallied for the show. SMOKE ALARM set the pace along the rail, vied to midstretch and weakened. ZANNO went
evenly three wide. AMOR LEJANO (ARG) played no factor while racing two wide. WEEKEND DREAMER bobbled at the start, saved ground, was bumped
and forced to check nearing the quarter pole and had no further bids.

Footnotes
BONHEUR was four wide early, moved in through the middle stages, came back out in upper stretch, and got up outside GARNER STATE PARK after a
long drive. GARNER STATE PARK was four to five wide on the first turn, raced in closest attendance to SASSY CAT while moving in a couple paths up the
backstretch, reached the front outside that rival in deep stretch, but could not withstand the winner. SASSY CAT shied in from GINGERONMYMIND after
the start bumping NIGHT ORCHID, took over from MAVI into the first turn and sped off, showed the way to the furlong grounds, and weakened. RED WIND
bumped with SHINE A LIGHT at the start, raced two wide on the turns, and gained late between horses. MISS MORENO was bumped between horses and
steadied shortly after the start, advanced into the stretch and gained late on the fence. GINGERONMYMIND raced three wide on the turns in range, and
was outfinished. NIGHT ORCHID was bumped between horses after the start, and was never prominent. SHINE A LIGHT bumped with RED WIND at the
break, steadied in tight soon after, and was never in contention. BROADWAY DIVA steadied soon after the start between horses, steadied inside on the first
turn near the back, got taken widest into the backstretch and remained outrun. MAVI tired inside after a half-mile. VIVA was through early inside.
