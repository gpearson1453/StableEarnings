SHESGOTATTITUDE set a clear pace from the outset, was on the inside into the lane, remained clear down the lane and held sway in the final stages.
TWILIGHT GLEAMING (IRE) was a bit slow and shut off at the start, chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but
drifted out a bit late and had no final gain on the winner. BURROW DOWN raced back early on along the inside, was off the rail into the lane with a belated
gain in the stretch from the inside. ACTION POTENTIAL tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run.
POUT chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane with some late gain in the stretch drive. MURGATROYD stalked the pace early, was in the
four path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch. SMILE AT THE STORM was a bit slow at the break and was no factor thereafter. ANOTHER

Footnotes
AVENUE stalked the dueling leaders from along the inside, smoothly shifted outside of those foes approaching the five sixteenths pole, swept past those
foes at the furlong pole, quickly drew clear, and was kept to task under hand urging to the wire. FREDDY FLINTSHIRE saved ground from midpack,
advanced along the inside turning for home, shifted to the three path inside of ALEXANDER VALLEY in upper stretch, then chased the clear leader home,
and outfinished his inner counterpart for place. ALEXANDER VALLEY tracked from midpack two wide around the turns, shifted four wide in upper stretch,
rallied outside of FREDDY FLINTSHIRE through the lane, but missed reaching that foe for place. BAKWENA saved ground off of the pace, rallied willingly
along the rail through the lane, but was put to tight quarters by a drifting CHARGER at the sixteenth grounds. SOUTHERN DISTRICT lied off of the pace
two to three wide around the turns, swung six wide entering the lane, but only produced a mild rally. PERFORMING ARTS lied off of the pace two wide,
gained four wide and outside of horses into the far turn, but got floated five wide approaching the five sixteenths, and leveled off in upper stretch. CHARGER
set the pace vie a narrow margin from AMERICAN DIAMOND, dug in in upper stretch as other outer foes ranged up, but offered little resistance to the
eventual winner passing the furlong grounds, then tired between horses. SAILOR'S RETURN lied at the rear of the field in the two to three paths around the
turns, swung seven wide entering the lane, but failed to factor. WAMEGO trailed along the inside around both turns, and never got involved. AMERICAN
DIAMOND vied for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses in midstretch. GOLDEN SPOKE stalked two to three wide, but weakened four wide
and between horses at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
PROMISE KEEPER was off a beat slowly, saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, advanced under his own power into the far turn to stalk the
leading duelers from the three path, swept by those foes in upper stretch, drew off readily under right handed urging through midstretch, and was driven
home. KINETIC SKY stalked the clear leader two wide, made an early bid for the lead at the half mile pole as WARRIOR IN CHIEF forced his hand, dueled
inside of that foe around the far turn, but offered little resistance to PROMISE KEEPER in upper stretch, and kept on to prove second best. GOOD
CULTURE lagged well behind the field down the backstretch, took the far turn in the four path, then passed tired foes through the lane for a minor share.
WARRIOR IN CHIEF tracked from midpack three wide, made an early bid for the lead at the half mile pole, dueled outside of KINETIC SKY through the far
turn, but tired between horses in upper stretch. PLAMEN opened up around the first turn to a wide advantage, but was headed by a pair of rivals at the half
mile pole, weakened around the far turn, and was done early. CORE VALUES was off a step slow, stayed in the five to four path around the first turn while
far off of the pace, and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
FIGHTING SEABEE stalked along the inside, inherited clear racing room along the rail after INVADER vacated that spot turning for home, inched closer in
upper stretch to spark a duel inside of that rival, then drove clear passing the sixteenth grounds. INVADER set the pace along the inside, shifted off of the
rail turning for home to meet SILENCED's bid, but allowed for FIGHTING SEABEE to slip inside of him in the process, dueled between those rivals through
upper stretch, but was bested by his inner counterpart with a sixteenth to go, then just held place at the wire. OPRY tracked from midpack two to three wide,
got floated four wide around the far turn, then five wide into the lane, and stayed on outside of foes through the final furlong to reach show on the wire while
missing place. SILENCED stalked two wide, bid for the lead entering the lane, vied outside of a pair of rivals through midstretch while hanging on his left
lead, then failed to keep pace with his inner most foe at the sixteenth grounds, and was nailed on the wire by an outer foe for show. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE
tracked while forwardly placed two wide, shifted outside of the leaders turning for home before entering the lane four wide, but only produced a mild kick,
failed to produce a bid, and was outfinished by an outer foe on the wire for a minor share. BAKERS BAY settled off of the pace two wide, took the far turn
between horses before shifting to the four path in upper stretch, but chased from behind the leaders through the lane, and failed to produce a bid. STREET
READY saved ground far off of the pace, chased two wide through the lane while behind the leading group, but was ridden handily late while looking for
racing room between those rivals. DUKE OF CARTHANIA lied far off of the pace two wide around the turns, swung six wide entering the lane, but failed to
factor. J W RUCKUS saved ground from midpack, but faded in upper stretch. ON A SPREE saved ground far off of the pace around the turns, swung to the
five path turning for home, but never got involved. STAGE READY trailed throughout, and was outrun.

CORNBREAD HILL cleared early on and shifted outwards to the four path, maintained a clear margin in the two path around the turn, drew away from
chasing foes in upper stretch, and was driven home. NO ANGEL pressed the pace from the four to the three path around the turn, then chased the clear
leader home while prevailing over an inner rival for place. PERSPECTIVE lied close up two wide and between horses early on, stalked the clear leader from
along the inside around the turn, shifted outside of that foe while inside of NO ANGEL entering the lane, but only managed to chase the leader home, and
got outfinished for place. VAIL OF HONOR trailed in the two path around the turn, swung five wide in upper stretch, and improved. EL CASADORA lied far
off of the pace in the three path around the turn, came into the lane in the four path, but lugged inwards in upper stretch, and failed to factor. QUALITY
WARRIOR pressed the pace five wide early on, chased the clear leader from the four path around the turn, but faded through the lane. GUNNER PAUL
chased along the inside, but was taken back when possibly put to tight quarters into the turn, and weakened thereafter. GIRO D'ORO was outrun.
