FINAL FORM away in good order dueled up front closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed inside the furlong grounds, kicked early under steady
handling. BRECHIN'S COMMAND in the second flight just off the inside, patiently handled through the turn, moved out, up late for the second spot, no
threat to the winner. IMAGINARY MUSIC dueled up front while outside the winner, could not keep up with that one the final furlong, caught late for the
place. POTRA LIZA fell back to lag well behind, picked off a tiring rival while never a threat. PRETTI SAVI in the second flight while racing three wide, came
up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
GHOSTLY WHO close from the start off the inside, advanced from the outside on the leader turning for home, shook clear, steadily increased advantage the
final furlong. PAT DADDY settled off the pace and the inside, three wide through the turn, roused into the lane, proved no match for entrymate in the final
sixteenth, held sway for the place. MINE MY TIME within striking distance while saving ground through the turn, shifted out for the drive, not enough late for
the place, gained the nod for the show while between horses at the wire. MAY WE ALL one paced off the inside, asked along while four wide late in the turn,
modest late interest while attempting to drift in a bit with a sixteenth to run, missed the show. KRISTO broke back, four wide exiting the turn, improved
slightly, no real threat. FLASH ATTACK last away, was never a factor. BRAVURA CREEK failed to menace. JOHNNY OBVIOUS broke alertly, cleared
toward the inside before a quarter, stopped when headed by the winner turning for home.

Footnotes
ROLLING FORK contested the pace from the start, vied between rivals through the turn, larger lead nearing the furlong grounds, drew clear under firm
handling. JACKMAN away in good order from the outside, pressed the issue three wide up the backstretch and through the turn, proved no match for the
winner the final furlong, clearly second best. IMA BLING CAT broke alertly, also raced with the pace closest to the rail and inside the winner, could not
match the top two in the drive, saved the show. IN THE ARCH back off the pace and the inside, came four wide out of the turn, slowly getting to the show
horse while no threat to the top pair. SPOTTED BULL lacked early foot just off the inside, dropped inside turning for home, improved position while also not
a serious threat. UNIDENTIFIED MAN last to leave, trailed for a half, came four wide out of the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals past the furlong
marker. FROSTED PRAYER settled in mid pack toward the inside, tired in the drive. CLEARLY MAD in the second flight in the early going, steadily faded.

Footnotes
SHESALITTLE EDGY broke alertly, dueled up front closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed entering the stretch, quickly clear, not threatened to
the wire under light pressure to win ridden out. MILLARD'S COMET in the second flight while in the two path, steered out a bit for the drive, rallied to be up
for the place, no threat to the winner. ENCANTA lacked early foot, raced three wide into the turn, roused late in the bend, split foes in upper stretch,
outkicked late for the place. JUSTATAPIN steadied, shuffled back in some tight quarters soon after the start, dropped to the inside for the turn, improved
position. MAIDEN ROCK off slowly, trailed early, three to four wide turn, passed a few tiring rivals to improve position. MISS MESS dueled up front while
outside the winner for four furlongs, gave way readily entering the stretch. MISS MOON PIE in the second flight while between foes, some traffic into the
turn, retreated in the run through the lane. KILBARRY LADY in the second group outside, four wide into the turn, also tired after a half. LETTERS TO BELLE
off a step slow, never involved.

Footnotes
DECADE stalked the pace in the three path up the backstretch, asked into the lane, collared the leader inside the furlong grounds, edged steadily clear
while being kept to pressure. FOUETTE broke on top, alternated up front closest to the inside, shook off the other speed by midway on the turn, clear past
the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, clearly second best. NOVEL SQUALL off a step slow, raced back well off the inside, came four wide out of
the turn, closest to the top two past the furlong marker, had little for that pair the final eighth, well clear of the others. MELTING SNOW lacked early foot
inside, angled out to be three wide late in the turn, improved position with some mild late interest. DANA'S BEAUTY settled off the pace, dropped to the
inside turning for home, went evenly through the stretch. SHEDIALED BURREAUX in the second group while racing toward the inside, tired through the
stretch. LADY ASTRID void of speed, steered four wide into the lane, remained always back. EMERALD PRINCESS set or forced the pace outside the
runner up for three furlongs and gave way.

Footnotes
MY GRACE away in good order, raced closest to the leader off the inside, went after that one into the stretch, bid nearing the midstretch point from the
outside, salted that rival away soon after, enough left to hold off the runner up in the waning strides. LIFE OF SATURDAYS lacked early foot, began a
steady advance off the inside turn, split foes late in the bend, shifted out slightly for the drive, late bid outside the winner, finished willingly but missed. TAPIT
RIGHT popped stall doors, broke alertly, quickly sprinted clear, continued to show the way toward but not on the inside turn, offered brief resistance to the
winner and dueled with that rival past the furlong marker then proved no match for that rival or the runner up, saved the show. HAMAZING LACE one paced
while off the inside, floated out a bit to be four wide exiting the turn, continued in even fashion in lacking a closing punch through the stretch.
MARCIAMARCIAMARCIA within striking distance while toward the inside, also came up empty in the drive. ROSE MARIE B settled off the pace while
outside, also turned in an even effort three wide. MISS PRONOUNCE void of speed, remained well back for a half, 4w into lane, improved by passing tiring
rivals with some mild late interest. SWEET HOLINESS veered into the gap to race well back, continued to lag for a half, also picked off faltering rivals. JERI
DAWN fractious in the gate, popped stall doors, broke slowly, remained back and passed tiring rivals as well. CADILLAC LADY lacked early foot while
outside, steered in turn, tired through the stretch. MORNING VALENTINE in mid pack while along the inside, backed up through the stretch. PRINCESS
STRATEGY four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, tired.

Footnotes
MISS BIGLY off the pace and the inside, pulled in the run up the backstretch, continued to be patiently handled through the final turn, rail bid into the lane,
gained the advantage then held the runner up safe late under steady handling. JILTED BRIDE off the pace and the inside, in some traffic second turn,
angled out to be three wide into the lane, outside bid midstretch, led, outkicked in the late going. BEST KEPT SECRET broke sharp, set the pace in hand
just off the inside, continued to show the way far turn, responded from between the top two when straightened for home, gave ground grudgingly to that pair
until late. W W FITZY prompted the pace while racing off the inside, had little left when the real running began turning for home. HEADLAND within striking
distance outside, fanned five wide exiting the final turn, came up empty for the drive. KIM K fell back after the start, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
EXULTING settled just off the pace and the inside, asked along far turn, challenged along the rail soon after, drew steadily clear through the lane under
pressure. HONORING MAJOR settled off the pace and the inside, four wide through the second turn, advanced, in time for the place, no threat to the
winner. RED AGAIN broke in good order, set the pace off the inside, had little for the winner, nipped late for the place, saved the show. DEFENDER
prompted the pace while off the inside, three wide second turn, hung in the drive in coming up empty. TASHKENT saved ground along the inside, one
paced while continuing along the rail. WAGON BOSS off slowly, trailed for a half, improved a bit while passing rivals. OFF THE MEDS off the pace and the
inside, failed to rally. OMEN OF CHANGE remained always back. ACOSTA broke outward and slowly, used while five wide into the first turn, pressed the
issue the middle half mild, stopped, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in.
