SOUTHERN BRIDGE controlled the pace inside, repelled challenges then drew away through the final furlong in a moderate drive. ROAN MOUNTAIN
reserved inside, bid on the final turn, angled out in the stretch and finished willingly. WOODHAVEN KID saved ground within striking range then flattened out
in the stretch. BIG RAY trailed early in the two path and lacked a rally. ABDAA angled inside early and was never a factor. JAYJAYDEE prompted the
winner for three quarters and gave way.

hand for the final yards. MYSTICAL CHARGE raced off the pace inside, advanced on the turn, came wide into the stretch, rallied outside and finished well
for second. KATESALUCKYGIRL chased close up outside, raced three wide on the turn, made a bid turning for home, weakened and held on for third.

passed tired rivals. NEON CITY was bumped after the start, raced two wide off the pace, swung wide, came four wide into the lane and then lacked a rally.

stretch and faded. PALOMA GRIS was bumped after the start, raced three wide off the pace, four wide on the turn and did not factor. CLOUT CHASER

WEST HORIZEN vied inside, moved clear to the outside in the stretch and remained safe while kept to a drive. TIZ A DATE broke a step slowly, advanced
inside and closed well. REIGNING FIRE trailed for half a mile, angled very wide in the stretch rallying too late. LUCKY OLIVIA ROSE prompted the pace
three wide to mid stretch and faltered. DIRTY BIRD settled off the leaders outside, drifted wide and flattened. SKOOKIE earned a narrow advantage in the
two path, vied through the turn and faded. BANGLE GAL broke poorly, rushed wide and stopped abruptly.

INDIAN LAKE forced the pace outside, took over at the five sixteenths pole and drew away driving. HEART RHYTHM reserved at the back of the field,
rallied before half a mile, moved wide in the stretch and was no match for the winner. JUST A THOUGHT well placed inside the pacesetters, faded on the
final turn then came again for the show. LOUIE'S LAW hustled to the lead inside, was collared on the final turn and weakened. NINE TOE JOHNNY
dropped far behind and was never in contention.

Footnotes
WENTZ dueled inside for the early lead, then eased back and tracked close up on the rail, angled out nearing the quarter pole, rallied outside in the stretch
drive and wore down CONFESSOR late for the win. CONFESSOR stalked close up two wide, bid on the far turn, took over nearing the quarter pole, shook
clear, dug in gamely in stretch run and yielded grudgingly late. SUPER DUDE raced two wide off the pace, moved up on the far turn and rallied mildly to
best the others. INFORMATIVE was off a step slow, raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn and then lacked a bid. OPTIC WAY dueled
two wide for the early lead, cleared off to set the pace, dueled with CONFESSOR on the far turn and faded in the lane. SEEK THE PEAK raced off the pace
and was outrun.

GENGHIS rushed to a clear early advantage, collared from the outside in the stretch and held on gamely. DIG CHARLIE DIG lacked speed, advanced wide
on the turn and closed strongly too late. NAUGHTY PRINCE pursued the winner, challenged in the stretch, could not get by but continued willingly to the
finish. OVER SENSUAL saved ground to the stretch and made a gradual late gain. SCREEN SAVER chased within striking range, moved to the rail on the
turn and flattened out. EMPEROR JOHN dropped back early, raced outside and trailed throughout.

gamely in the final furlong and yielded grudgingly. LOLANITA raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the turn and rallied mildly for third.
CHUBOFFTHEOLDBLOCK raced three wide off the pace, advanced on the turn, steadied between rivals at the quarter pole and was outkicked for third.
MISS LOYALTY was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside and had no rally. DREAMING DIAMONDS chased three wide and tired. GATOR GIRL raced
