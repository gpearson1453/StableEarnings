SENNEBEC SUMMER pulled under a snug hold while racing along the inside, was angled three wide leaving the turn, rallied and pulled clear in the late
going. A GIRL LIKE ME settled while four wide, moved closer on the turn and kept on while four wide in the stretch. SEATTLE BAY prompted the pace,
gained a narrow lead on the turn and was worn down in the stretch. MINGO MAGIC never menaced. HOLIDAY ROMANCE was outpaced early and never
involved. BE AMAZING drifted out a bit at the start, dueled leading narrowly in the early going, was headed leaving the turn and faltered in the stretch.

broke hesitantly, was reserved, was angled four wide into the stretch and finished well. LAST BATTLE was outpaced and lacked a response. HIS GIANT
chased the pacesetter in vain and weakened.

and showed good late interest. BYE LOVE GOTTA GO never menaced. LEIGHTON KENTUCKY was always outrun. REPEAL forced the pace and
weakened. JACK'S PARTY GIRL showed little.
