Footnotes
CLASSY CHROME broke readily, was urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, forged clear while shifting out racing into
upper stretch and was kept to firm right handed encouragement. HEELS TOGETHER, in touch with the leaders four wide, then three wide prompting the
pace into the turn, continued in pursuit of the winner into upper stretch but proved no match. OWEN'S PLEASURE broke outwards bumping RANSOMS
REWARD, was rated off the first flight on the backstretch, gained position between foes entering the turn, was taken up avoiding tight quarters midway
through the bend, swung out four wide in upper stretch and continued with an effort to regain some position while earning a share. RANSOMS REWARD,
bumped at the start, was righted to gain a forward placing between foes prompting the pace, shifted inwards dropping off the first flight racing into the turn
and faded in the drive. POURQUOI, forwardly placed five wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards racing through the turn tracking just off the leaders
between foes but had no closing response. LADY CLEMENTINE, urged between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way
after a half.

Footnotes
BABY BOOMER broke outwards making some contact with DOC AMSTER at the start, was rated off the leaders while angling to the inside racing through
the backstretch, steadily drew into striking distance on the turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to
just collar DOC AMSTER in time under strong handling. The latter, bumped at the start, was urged disputing the pace racing a bit off the rail inside a rival
through the backstretch, resisted grudgingly while regaining a narrow advantage between calls late and just missed. PHASE OUT angled inwards to force
the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, dueled past midstretch but yielded to the top pair late. WELD settled well off the leaders while
switching out to the five path in early stages, steadily gathered momentum while angling four wide entering the stretch and continued with interest to
improved position to the end. BATTLE RAGS switched off the inside early tracking just off the first flight, was prompted to advance in tandem with the
eventual winner nearing upper stretch, lost some momentum when his rider lost his irons leaving the quarter pole and faded in the drive. LIL' NINJA settled
well off the leaders while angling inside early, came under pressure to contend but lacked a response.

Footnotes
MY BLONDE MARY, reserved in early stages, gradually gained position between foes just off the inside racing into the turn, angled to the rail entering upper
stretch and continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage inside the pacesetter in time under firm encouragement. LA WAPA, urged forcing
the pace outside a rival from the outset, forged clear nearing upper stretch to open a commanding advantage, drifted out markedly midstretch and failed to
sustain her momentum. MADAME ROUGE, urged along the inside disputing the pace into the turn, gave way nearing upper stretch. GALIT JAK was taken
up avoiding traffic just after the start, was righted to track the leaders four wide into the turn, then continued evenly in that path to late stages. DIVA DANA,
forced out just after the start by TWINKIESANDTURNIPS, was collected to track off the first flight three wide racing into the turn and faded between foes
entering the lane. KELCIE'S MANDATE ducked out at the start, then was taken in hand while her rider corrected his course, settled well off the field and
failed to menace thereafter. ASTROMELIA, caught in tight quarters at the start, angled to the rail in early stages but had no closing response.
TWINKIESANDTURNIPS veered out sharply impeding rivals at the start and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
FLASH TOWN tracked the leaders from just out of striking distance racing four wide to the turn, was prompted to commence a steady advance in that path
nearing upper stretch and wrested the advantage in the closing stages under firm left handed encouragement. DON'T EATTHE APPLE broke out bumping
SEE ME SEE YOU, was righted, then urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin, resisted the winner's challenge racing into upper stretch
but was collared late. SEE ME SEE YOU, bumped at the start, was quickly righted to gain a forward placing between foes, angled inwards nearing the turn
tracking just off the pacesetter and weakened in the closing stages. RACE DAY SPEED settled last outside foes on the backstretch, angled inwards nearing
upper stretch to split foes and continued with interest to improve position. CAJUN DELIGHT broke slowly, tracked the leaders from out of striking distance in
the three path racing into the turn but no closing bid. SUGAR BRITCHES settled along the inside in the opening stages, angled out nearing the lane but
offered no rally. AMERICA'S QUEEN tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing upper stretch. BY MY OWN
tracked off the second flight between foes and retreated early. SCOWLING RIDGE, urged to a forward placing three wide pursuing the pacesetter into the
turn, was taken in hand, then shifted well outside rivals nearing upper stretch, was pulled up leaving midstretch, then was vanned off the course.

Footnotes
DOUBLE DEMON was rated off the second flight in the opening half, shifted out entering the far turn, exchanged contact with ROSENQUIST midway
through the bend but continued with a steady three, then four wide advance racing into upper stretch to wrest the advantage in the closing stages under firm
left handed pressure. ROSENQUIST settled well off the leaders along the inside in early stages, readily advanced to contention along the rail after a half,
switched out to gain position between foes entering the far turn while exchanging bumps midway through the bend, split foes to bid just inside the eventual
winner midstretch but was outkicked. OL GREY GHOST, pulling a bit against restraint tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
make an early move three wide between foes nearing the second bend to gain a clear advantage, held sway along the inside into upper stretch but failed to
sustain that momentum. CREATIVE CHOICE tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the first turn, was urged to advance in tandem with that rival
four deep nearing the second bend, but couldn't match terms with that rival and gave way between foes nearing midstretch. ABE HONESTLY, urged along
the rail disputing the pace from the outset to the backstretch, gave way after a half. OSABA was outpaced early. UP AND ONWARD was urged forcing the
pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch and gave way between foes nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
JOY CITY broke sharply, angled inwards dictating the pace along the rail on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, repelled a rival's challenge to go clear
in upper stretch, then continued gamely while shifting off the inside in the closing stages to prevail under strong handling. KING ANDRES was settled off the
second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three, then four wide to upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to close the gap
on the winner while edging a rival for second. MR. WHO tracked the leaders three deep in second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to gain
position between foes in that path on the far turn, angled to the inside in the closing stages and continued willingly inside the pacesetter to just miss for
second. MILBURN, reserved outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide entering the lane and made some belated
progress. KRAMDEN tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight and faded into upper stretch. SURVEY (IRE) worked her way to the inside tracking off
the second flight to the far turn but lacked a rally. VINTNER settled last along the inside and failed to menace. KING LEONARDO was urged to terms
prompting the pacesetter into the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. A GIRLS BESTFRIEND tracked off the
second flight between foes and faded early.

Footnotes
SUNDRENCHED, off a step slowly, was urged to gain the lead inside foes racing into the first turn, sped clear along the rail into the backstretch, met the
challenge of PAYNTER FEST racing through the far turn into upper stretch, then gamely held MARVELLA on a safe margin through late stages under firm
handling. The latter angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, shifted out three wide
entering the lane, moved to challenge the winner in late stages but proved only second best. PAYNTER FEST, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off
the pacesetter, shifted in on the far turn to press the issue into upper stretch but flattened out late. CROWN OF JOY reserved between foes in the opening
half, was prompted to advance splitting foes while swinging out five wide in upper stretch and continued to improve position. DARLINDIVA tracked the
pacesetter between foes in second flight, lost ground to the leaders while shifting out four wide in the lane and gave way. LAPULGA, unhurried inside foes
racing to the backstretch and continued evenly while proving no threat. JUST A BIT SASSY angled inwards to track off the second flight between foes and
faded into the lane. REINA LA KELSY, held up out of tight quarters start, dropped out last and passed only tiring rivals. SAPPHIRE JUBILEE, caught four
wide racing into the first turn, dropped out early. BIG BASE tracked off the second flight outside foes, was fanned six wide into the lane and steadily
retreated.

Footnotes
COACH JER'S JOY stalked the pacesetter between foes while angled inside the leader racing through the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing upper
stretch steadily advancing to challenge, was brushed by BE SNEAKY racing past midstretch but wrested the advantage from that foe late under firm
handling. The latter broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing well off the rail through the backstretch, shifted inwards entering the bend
contesting the issue inside a rival to upper stretch, drifted out resisting the winner's bid brushing that rival in the closing stages but couldn't contain that foe.
SHE DAZZLE, forwardly placed four wide in the opening stages, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter into the turn, pressed the issue between foes into
upper stretch and gave out in late stages. MARKETABILITY was settled last on the backstretch, shifted four wide nearing the turn while being prompted to
advance, continued in that path to upper stretch but had no final bid. CHARGE IT ALL settled between foes in early stages, shifted out to race three wide
between foes into the turn but offered no rally. HELL OF THE NORTH made brief pursuit of the leaders between foes just off the inside on the backstretch
but faded from contention early. DANNYHILL tracked just off the leaders nearest the rail in the opening stages but steadily faded racing into the turn.

backstretch, was prompted to advance on the leaders four wide nearing the far turn, continued with a steady advance three deep to wrest command racing
into upper stretch, shifted inside once clear and widened the margin under pressure. VIGO, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter to
the backstretch, was prompted to challenge for command between foes while steadying in tight quarters nearing upper stretch, couldn't match the winner
but prevailed for the place honors. BEACH BANDIT settled near the inside in the opening stages, was prompted to advance between foes in close quarters
exchanging light contact with GATOR BITE entering the far turn, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued willingly to prevail for a share.
BIG POLO tracked off the second flight racing to the backstretch, gained position three wide between foes racing into upper stretch but had no final kick.
GATOR BITE, reserved along the inside in the opening stages, steadily gained position inside foes while caught in close quarters entering the far turn,
saved ground to upper stretch but came up empty late. STARSHIP CAESAR, urged clear while angling to the inside on the first turn, set the pace to the far
turn and gave way. UNCLE ARMANDO ducked inwards at the start to break last, was reserved between foes, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch
gathering momentum, ducked in towards the rail nearing midstretch clipping a rival's heels, was steadied and had no further response. DEVILISH
THOUGHTS, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the pacesetter, gave way after a half. STRIKING MIKE tracked just off the pacesetter along the
inside to the backstretch but faded early. TIZ TRIUMPHANT tracked off the second flight between foes, drifted out badly racing through the first turn carrying
