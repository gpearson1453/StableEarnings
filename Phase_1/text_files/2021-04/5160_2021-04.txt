GRECIAN ADMIRAL pressured the pace and took the nod three wide past the quarter pole, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. ROCKET SOUND
chased from the outside, raced in the five path of the turn and finished well to take second later yards. STERLING CAESAR was hustled up to set a
pressured pace off the rail, gave up the nod past the quarter pole and raced at the rail through the turn, then flattened out the final sixteenth. ISLAND
CADGER gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and finished evenly. WINDSOR'S FUN broke awkwardly then rushed up to pressure the pace inside, but
dropped back at the rail midway on the turn and gave way toward the top of the lane.

Footnotes
LASER LOOP settled off the early pace about the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced three wide on the far turn, dueled to the front
inside the sixteenth pole and edged clear later yards. RELENTLESS STRIKE took the lead into the opening turn and rated the pace, came under pressure
past the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in under steady handling, was headed inside the sixteenth pole and relented later
yards. CATCH MY CABOOSE raced with the early pace inside but dropped back midway on the opening turn, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, came through the far turn off the rail, eased out mid-stretch and finished evenly. FRENCH'S QUEST saved ground well off the early pace,
bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the two and three paths and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. ZALZA saved
ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, but showed little further. ABLE BAKER CHARLIE rounded the
opening turn about the four path, raced outside into the backstretch, though, showed little response.

DONTMESAWITHME stalked from the two and three paths then challenged leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead nearing the five sixteenths and
contested the edge two deep on the far turn, then dug in under determined handling to inch clear of the game FU MAN SUE, who rated the pace inside,
came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and was headed toward the five sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on
the far turn then dug in gamely to mid-stretch before reluctantly ceding the final sixteenth. ANOTHER VICTORY was bumped leaving the gate then saved
ground off the pace, bid past the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, angled three wide in the upper stretch and finished well. HOBE SOUND
settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and raced close in the three path of the far turn, entered the
stretch four wide, then weakened. POOL BOY CHARLIE broke outward to make contact with Another Victory and bobbled upon contact, stalked from the
three and four paths early on, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole then faded into the far turn. TRIFOR GOLD broke sharply and rated close
to the early pace inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but appeared to take a bad step toward the three eighths pole, was immediately
taken up and walked off post race.

Footnotes
STOLEN BEAUTY gave chase down the backstretch and came through the turn about the five path, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and widened the final
sixteenth. BELLA GIANNA pressured the pace and dueled to the lead two deep approaching the quarter pole, drifted a bit leaving the turn, was caught
mid-stretch and had to settle for second. HONORABLE LILLY chased through the backstretch and raced off the rail on the turn, then flattened inside the
sixteenth pole. COUNTRY MAGIC was hustled along to set a pressured pace but gave up the lead at the rail nearing the quarter pole, continued close
through the turn then weakened the final sixteenth. TUNSTALL pressured the early pace but steadied from tight quarters at the rail leaving the three eighths
pole and showed little further in the stretch. SWEETONTHEGENTS chased outside, rounded the turn in the four path then weakened. ESTHER'S
FORTUNE was slow getting into stride then outrun.

SPURN was reluctant to load then engaged in close chase through the backstretch, dueled three wide on the turn and dug in under steady urging to take
over the final yards. RIVER CROSROAD RVF chased from the outside early then veered to the inside approaching the five sixteenths pole, squeezed
through an opening at the rail leaving the turn, dueled to a slim brief lead toward the sixteenth pole but was outfinished the final yards. GOLDEN KEY set
the pace down the backstretch and contested just off the rail on the turn, was caught nearing the sixteenth pole and flattened later yards. BUBBA GRUMP
exchanged contact with HARBOUR TOWN leaving the gate then engaged in close early chase, rounded the turn off the rail, eased outward through the lane
but flattened later yards, while the latter exchanged contact with Bubba Grump leaving the gate and saved ground while giving chase, raced at the rail on
the turn but showed little more. HOPPING HENRY gave chase outside then bore out on the turn. MELTECH and KITE SURFER were not factors.

Footnotes
BEYOND PRETTY raced in the four path the opening turn and settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, saved ground into the second turn and
started a bid toward the five sixteenths, took the lead three wide midway on the far turn, raced clear toward the head of the lane and was steadily handled to
widen. LIL SWEETHEART rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail into the
far turn, was caught midway through the turn but dug in under steady urging and held on for second. WHIZ PASS settled off the pace and off the rail, bid
approaching the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, came along for third inside the sixteenth pole and was gaining slowly
on the runner-up. RUN ON ENERGY rounded the first turn in the three path then stalked from the seven eighths pole, challenged toward the three eighths,
raced close in the three path of the far turn, but drifted into the lane and weakened. RAISON D'ETAT GIRL raced off the earlier pace in the three and four
paths, entered the backstretch outside and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the four path then
weakened. HOT POSSEBILITY saved ground off the pace and was never a factor. FLICKER'S PRINCESS stalked the early pace then challenged and gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded readily past the five sixteenths.
