KING'S GOLD settled off the dueling leaders, advanced on the far turn, rallied three wide at the quarter pole, gained a short lead and then edged away
under urging. SPEED SYNDROME raced off the pace outside a rival, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside in the stretch and got up for second.
QUALITY SPECIAL dueled inside for the lead, opened up a long lead in tandem with GRAND OASIS on the backside, continued to duel with that rival on
the far turn, dug in through the lane and held on for third. GRAND OASIS dueled outside for the lead, battled heads apart on the backside, dueled into the
lane, dug in between rivals and then weakened. SURFER BOY GEORGE raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far turn, made a rail bid and
steadied in tight at the quarter pole, then finished evenly on the rail through the stretch. EARTHQUAKE raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide
on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
CHUB WAGON bobbled a bit at the break, vied inside for the lead, shook free on the turn, widened the margin on her own, then drew off under some urging
and was ridden out. PROMISED STORM stalked the pace, chased on the turn, rallied three wide into the lane, dug in gamely outside of UJJAYI and earned
the place spot. UJJAYI raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the turn and rallied mildly on the rail. TROLLEY RIDE raced off the pace inside, came
two wide into the land and failed to threaten. I'M THE TALENT vied two wide for the lead, chased the winner on the turn and tired in the lane. ISABELLA
SMILE raced two wide off the pace, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally.

VALERIE FIRST settled inside, advanced on the final turn, moved wide in the stretch and was just up. PASSPORT REQUIRED pursued the loose
pacesetter, took over into the stretch but was nailed at the wire. TAYLOR'S BELLE saved ground in striking range, moved out into the stretch rallying.
SPECTACULAR NOW controlled the pace inside for three quarters then came up empty. QUIET PLEASE chased in midpack and never menaced.
SUPERGIRL POWER settled off the leaders for half a mile and stopped. JENNYANYSPOT trailed early and was never in contention. GO METRO GIRL
broke sluggishly, raced far behind and was eased late. GEORGIA BONNET was a late scratch on the advice of the track veterinarian.
