Footnotes
THIS IS MY PRAYER pressed the pace, took the lead around the second turn, pulled away and finished well. HANGING LAKE unhurried in the early going,
moved up around the final turn, angled out entering the stretch, wide bid, proved no match for the winner, but outfinished SWEET MILAGROS for second.
SWEET MILAGROS raced near the back in the beginning, came around the second turn wide, made a bid and was outfinished for second. WISH FOR
INTEREST was an early factor, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a finish. GEAUX GOLDEN went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and
weakened. DIGNITYTO INFINITY raced in the middle of the pack, came around the final turn wide and put forth an even effort. NICKYS GUITAR lacked
early speed and was never a factor. RUNNING ROSADO always raced near the back, finished wide and was never a threat. RUNNING UNBRIDLED raced
within contention, dropped back and eased to the wire. TWN PALMYSDESTINY pressed the early pace, retreated to the back and was eased.

Footnotes
CURTIN'S UP pressed the early pace, moved up around the turn, pulled away down the stretch and proved much the best. CHASIN GRACIE vied for the
early lead, saved ground around the turn, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. MALIBU JACK raced within striking distance,
entered the stretch four wide, made a bid, proved no match for the top two, but a clear third. HOT APRIORITY raced near the back in the early part, came
around the turn wide, made a mild bid, but was no factor. SPREAD THE FAITH void of early speed and was never a threat. KENSLEY'S HIPPIE dueled on
the front end and made a steady retreat. TRUMP MEDIA always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
LAUGHING LATINOS went to the front, drove clear and won under steady urging. COCO'S MAN broke in, pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout,
proved no match for the winner, dueled to the wire with RAY'S KIMUA and held on for second. RAY'S KIMUA raced within striking distance, came around
the final turn on the outside, dueled down the lane with COCO'S MAN and was outfinished for second. TAP A MIRACLE raced in the middle of the field,
made a mild bid, but was no factor. TIN DELAY challenged for the early advantage, saved ground and weakened. KINGPRIN broke out, pressed the early
pace and faded. DOUBLE PRIORITY lacked early speed, raced outside around the first turn, finished wide and was no threat. UNBRIDLED PULPIT
shuffled back at the start, raced outside around the first turn and was never a threat. GALLOPING BOOTS broke a step slow and was never close.
SMOKEY GAVIN broke out, raced near the middle of the pack, dropped back and was no threat late.

FLASHING ANGELBABY sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and held on well for the win. MISTAKE PRESENT raced within contention, came
around the second turn on the outside, rallied down the lane and was getting to the winner. ZING ZANG raced near the back in the beginning, saved ground
around the second turn, made a mild bid, but was no match for the top two. AVAILABLE STAR pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and
weakened down the home stretch. LIAM SKYE raced evenly near the back, saved ground around the final turn and was never a factor. NASTIDA MAST
void of early speed, raced wide around the final turn and showed little.

MY WICKED WISH went to the front, drove clear, saved ground around the final turn, dueled down the lane with IZEONPOINT and prevailed for the win.
IZEONPOINT pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, saved ground around the turn, angled out entering the stretch, dueled down the lane and was
outfinished for the win. TOTALLY GRACE broke in, racing near the back, drifted out around the first turn, made a mild bid, proved no match for the top two,
but got up for third. DIALED J raced within contention, made a bid and weakened. THIRSTYPROSPECT shut off at the start, had an outside trip and was
never a threat. BODIE ON POINTE broke in, raced in the back and was never a threat. LEFT OF THE DIAL pressed the early pace and dropped back.
