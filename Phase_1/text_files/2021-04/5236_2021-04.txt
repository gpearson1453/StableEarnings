start, was five and six wide into the lane and closed well but was too late. CHIRON ECLIPSE broke outward to bump with a rival, contested the lead inside
rivals and was outfinished late. LIBERTY FLIES was just off the lead group four wide and could not produce the needed late run. GIVE EM SHADE was
along the inside in good position but lacked a final closing run. COWGIRL COURT vied from between rivals to upper stretch and weakened some late. TOP
OF THE PODIUM stalked three wide and lacked a final closing bid. SWEET ECLIPSE bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground and was not a threat.

Footnotes
TIGER ON YOUR SIX stalked leaders three wide, rallied through the lane then lugged in late to bump WILD DRIVE soundly nearing the wire. WILD DRIVE
was on the pace inside ORDAINED CAT racing out from the rail, was reeled in by TIGER ON YOUR SIX late as that one rallied while lugging in and was
bumped soundly deep stretch. AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH WAS CONDUCTED AND TIGER ON YOUR SIX WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED
SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE DEEP STRETCH. GREEN CARD rallied five wide on the far turn then could not reach the top pair in the lane. ALL FOR
TRUTH saved ground and lacked a final closing run. WILLOWY DANSEUR was not a threat three wide. FULKERSON stalked the leaders four wide and
weakened. ORDAINED CAT contested the pace outside WILD DRIVE and weakened into the lane. FOR THE HUSTLE was not a threat four wide.
TAYLOR'S PRINCE followed the pace three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
MR. MIKE gained the inside going to the first turn to establish the pace just off the rail, was pressed throughout, shook off his challengers and edged clear in
the lane. HOLIDAY MAN forced the pace three wide outside the winner then could not handle that one late while saving the place. IT IS DEJAVU stalked
the pace from along the inside, offered up a mild bid in the lane and narrowly missed the place. NATTYTYME was five and six wide with the pace
throughout and could not produce the needed late rally. MERLO'S LAD prompted the pace four wide and weakened some in the lane.
THEBOYFROMJERSEY was just off the pace four and five wide to the far turn and weakened. HUNTER ROCKS dropped off the pace racing three wide,
angled six wide into the lane and was not a factor. PIERPONT saved ground and weakened. SPOON BOSS trailed.

to have aim at the leaders turning for home but could not close the gap. DREAMING ABOUT YOU trailed early, rallied through the far turn and continued
with a belated run. WITTS QUESTION moved up three wide while not a threat. RANBIR forced the pace outside SYLVIA'S ROCKET to the far turn and
weakened. JUST SPLENDID stalked the leaders four wide and tired. P R GIRL CRUSH tired racing four and five wide. GYPSY WIND JEANNE was not a

Footnotes
UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY tracked the leaders four wide to bid through the far turn, showed in front turning for home and edged clear. BENTLEY'S DREAM
forced the pace inside LEIGHTON KENTUCKY to bid into the far turn, then could not go with the winner in the lane. REMARKABLE CHARM reared at the
break and dropped off the early pace, rallied six wide into the lane and finished well to gain third late. MISS RULES was along the inside in good position but
lacked a final closing run. LEIGHTON KENTUCKY made the pace racing out from the rail to the far turn and weakened in the drive. JAMACIAN ME MONEY
chased the early pace three wide and gave way in the far turn.

handling. PANIC BUTTON rallied three and four wide through the far turn and gained the place late. AFFIX settled off the pace four wide, rallied through the
far turn and missed the place late. MINER'S NOTION stalked the pace two or three wide, lost ground through the far turn then regained position in the lane.
SMOKIN B saved ground to challenge into the far turn and could not sustain the move. BEHOLD THAT WORD saved ground while trailing, angled four wide
into the lane and moved up while not a threat. DREAM BABY DREAM tracked the early pace three or four wide and tired into the lane. KEEP ON ZENON
ON prompted the pace two to three wide and tired. CATALE COLE MAN made the pace out from the rail to late backstretch and gave way in the far turn.
