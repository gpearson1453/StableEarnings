Footnotes
DREAM PRINCESS forwardly placed in the first turn when three wide, stalked the two leaders up the backstretch, advanced and challenged on the outside
late in the final turn, drew well clear, ridden out. FORTUNA ADIUVAT narrowly showed the way into the first turn, dueled the middle half, vied through the
second turn, closest to the inside, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner entering the stretch then proved no match, clearly second best. DUCHESS
BUBBLES off a step slow, raced back toward the inside, saved ground into the far turn, improved through that bend, tipped out a bit for the drive, finished up
best of the rest while not a threat to the top two. SHE'S XTREMELY HOT off slowly, moved up a bit early, raced four wide into the far turn, went evenly
through the stretch. RENEGADE SUNSET dueled up front while outside the runner up, pressed that one up the backstretch and into the far turn, gave way
from between the top two late in the final turn. WINNING WALK settled off the pace and the inside, was finished after a half. CAGED BEAR was finished
early, trailed home in showing little.

Footnotes
SHAKES CREEK broke back, moved up to duel into the first turn, alternated for the lead in the run up the backstretch, disposed of the other speed by
midway on the final turn, clear into the lane, increased that advantage to the wire under steady handling. AQWAAM broke sharp, dueled inside the winner
into and through the first turn, continued to vie up the backstretch, could not match that same rival in the drive, remained clear for the place. BOBBY BABY
in the second flight through the first turn off while moving out to be three wide onto the backstretch, chased the top pair in vain throughout, stayed clear for
the show late. TAPITOR last to leave, trailed while four wide into the first turn, continued back and three wide, improved position a bit without making an
impact. FRONT PAGE went one paced throughout in lacking a closing kick. SPLASH FOR GOLD in tight, steadied into the first turn, remained back
throughout.

Footnotes
MISS MESS close from the start off the inside, went after the leader into the turn, collared that rival midway on the bend, clear into the lane, held the runner
up safe the final furlong under steady handling. JUST LIFE forwardly placed just off the inside, continued to chase the leaders in the two path through the
turn, closest to the winner upper stretch, no late gain on that one, well clear of the others. SUPER CASSIDY broke alertly, narrowly set the early pace,
dueled inside the winner early turn, could not match that one into the lane nor contain the runner up, saved the show. AS REQUIRED settled off the pace
and the inside, three out to four wide exiting the turn, slowly gaining for the show. LADY LUTE void of speed off the inside, four wide into the turn, lacked a
serious rally while remaining outside. LADY ELIANA off a step slow, in the second flight inside, lacked a response in the drive. KIMMY remained back while
saving ground.

Footnotes
EGO broke back, outrun in the early going toward the inside, continued to be unhurried into the far turn, began to advance soon after, challenged with a
strong move three wide turning for home, quickly clear, kept to task with a steady left handed crop. SHARECROPPER forwardly placed, moved up to vie
three wide onto the backstretch, continued to contest the issue on the outside into the far turn, proved no match for the winner, narrowly held the place spot
late. OFF THE MEDS settled off the pace in the second flight inside, continued to save ground through the second bend, roused for the drive, slowly gaining
for the show late. CANDY CARLOS with the early pace while three wide into the first turn, contested the pace while between rivals in the run up the
backstretch, weakened in the drive. EPIC (ARG) fell back to trail after the start, continued to lag the middle half mile, passed tiring rivals while never a
serious threat. CALCULATED RISKER with the early pace, squeezed back then steadied from between rivals in the first turn, remained back in failing to
threaten. DRIVEN TO COMPETE vied early while between rivals, gave way in the far turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
RAGATAGTAG raced back off the pace inside, boxed in, waited while along the inside late in the turn, tipped out entering the stretch, split foes to challenge
soon after, drove well clear. BRECHIN'S COMMAND in the second flight while racing off the inside, continued in the second flight outside the winner,
ranged up three to four wide to challenge turning for home, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, held sway for the second spot. SHAHARAZAD
lacked speed off the inside, three wide into the lane, set down for the drive, rallied mildly to be slowly getting to the runner up late. FRIENDLY AND KIND
back off the pace, saved ground through much of the turn, moved out into the two path for the drive, improved slightly while not a serious threat. TRIPLE
SCOUT dueled up front in the two path, weakened in the drive. BACKSEAT PROMISES lacked early foot, improved position without posing a serious threat.
MARY ALICE dueled up front along the inside, gave way in the drive. MIA PROMESSA off a step slow, remained always back. STRONG PATRIOT
forwardly placed early outside, steadily faded.

Footnotes
DOLLY DIMPLE within striking distance, in some traffic into the lane, advanced and challenged between horses into the lane, drew clear while drifting out.
MY DAMS ATITUDE back off the pace and the inside, three wide through much of the turn, angled in then back out to briefly challenge entering the stretch,
could not match strides with the winner to the wire, clearly second best. NEELIE ANN broke alertly, narrowly set the pace along the inside, weakened
through the stretch while remaining along the inside but comfortably saved the show. LIFE OF SATURDAYS mid pack early toward the inside, steadied
when in tight five furlongs out, encountered additional traffic while remaining inside late in the turn and into the lane, went evenly to the wire when clear for
the drive. FANCY BLAZE bothered just after the start, raced back and off the inside, improved position with some modest late interest. SPURWINK LANE
flashed speed off the inside for the opening quarter then began to retreat before a half. UNBRIDLED TWISTER forwardly placed while well wide up the
backstretch, advanced and challenged four wide midway on the bend, came five wide into the lane then backed up in the run to the wire. MY GRACE broke
in then was straightened to race within striking distance, bit closer 3-4w late in the turn, stopped in the drive.

DESCENTE outrun early, advanced through some traffic and challenged three wide turning for home, vied past the furlong marker, edged clear late.
LULUMARU moved up to contest the issue into the first turn, a bit rank through that bend, showed the way up the backstretch, continued to hold the
advantage into the lane, vied past the furlong marker, came out with a sixteenth remaining to bother PERFECT ICE STORM then outkicked that rival to the
wire. PERFECT ICE STORM broke alertly, set or forced the pace in the two path, vied between horses past midstretch, could no match the winner to the
wire, bothered late and finished evenly to be clear of the others. FIERY LADY within striking distance inside, continued to save ground through the second
turn, lacked a significant closing kick to pose no threat to the top three. SOUTHERN CENTS in the second flight while racing in the three path, also came up
empty for the drive. LADY MCKENZIE five wide into the first turn when well off the pace, remained back, three wide through the second turn, lacked a
closing rally. RAHWAY broke in then steadied, recovered to race in the second group between foes first turn, in bit tight, steadied, faded after four furlongs.
CHAMPAGNE HORIZON four wide into the first turn, continued outside, four to five wide through the second bend, had nothing for the drive and finished
well back. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, LULUMARI WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED

REASON TO SOAR in mid pack early while racing three wide, ranged up to challenge four wide turning for home, set down upper stretch, edging clear late
under continued firm handling. COROT vied up front early inside, continued to force the issue through the turn along the rail, remained on the inside for the
drive when contesting past the furlong marker, could not match the winner late, enough left for the place. FLAT LUCKY broke back, void of speed, three
down to the two path late in the turn, rallied through traffic while too late for the second spot. NAUGHTY ALFRED bothered slightly at the break, raced back
and off the inside, three wide into the lane, improved position while also finding his best stride too late. ROYAL COMMISSION forwardly placed early well
wide, four wide into the lane, challenged in the three path midway on the bend, failed to sustain that effort through the stretch. THATSAFACTJACK away in
good order, narrowly set the pace in the two path, continued to battle into the stretch then gradually weakened. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT void of speed, passed
tiring rivals while not a threat. MARQUEE THUNDER in mid pack toward the inside early, three wide turning for home, tired through the stretch. HURTS SO
GOOD in the main body in the run up the backstretch, tapped on the brakes and steadied into the turn, fell back and failed to threaten. SHIP BOSS
prompted the early pace, in tight early in the turn then began a steady retreat.

RAINTREE STARLET stumbled at the start, quickly recovered to clear before a quarter inside, was given a breather through the turn, stayed clear through
the lane while being kept to task with a steady right handed crop. SANDY SANGRIA in the second flight along the inside, crept a bit closer turning for home,
proved no match for the top pair the final furlong. A. P. PRINCESS broke alertly, chased the winner in vain in the two path, proved no match in the drive,
comfortably held the place. JENNEMILY off the inside and the pace, faded three wide. BOATHOUSE VIEW was never a factor.
