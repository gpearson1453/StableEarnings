FLOWER'S FORTUNE stalked the pace on the outside under a snug hold, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, took the
advantage at the five-sixteenths, shook clear when asked for her best into upper stretch and proved best under steady urging. BEWPS moved out then
settled comfortably on the outside, was asked in the four path on the turn, drifted out some near the three-sixteenths, chased the winner under a drive into
the final furlong and was outfinished while just able to get the place. MIA CALIA settled off the pace, drafted in the two path while in good striking range on
the turn, was roused while moving out into upper stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong, drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole and just missed
the place while well clear for the show. MARIA'S GIFT moved in while showing the way down the backstretch, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked
under heavy threat at the three-eighths then lost the advantage at the five-sixteenths, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way. AURANNIAN was
coaxed along at the rear, went five then six wide under urging on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
STAR DEVINE (IRE) was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, settled towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path, shifted six wide while
roused at the quarter-pole, rallied fast on the outside, closed strongly to get the lead approaching the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging.
CANDY JAR was well placed just off the pace, raced under some urging in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch then moved out a bit
more, gained to make a bid between horses outside the furlong marker but was outfinished while able to get the place. DOVIMA settled under some urging,
went three wide on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch then had the winner blow by on the outside, moved out from behind horses outside the furlong
marker and finished willingly to garner the show. TREVISE brushed the outside of the gate at the start, settled towards the front on the outside, was roused
four wide on the turn, gained to make a bid outside the furlong marker but was out-kicked while able to save the last spot in the superfecta. MUN LUV was
sent hard to the lead, showed the way through quick fractions, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a
drive in upper stretch and weakened. LILLY SIMONE settled off the pace, went five wide on the turn, gained to make a brief bid nearing the furlong marker
but was also out-kicked. POLITICAL GRIDLOCK broke out at the start, stalked the pace down the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, took a
short lead while put to a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and tired. TIPSY CHATTER settled on the inside, dropped
back near the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn, raced off heels inside the five-sixteenths, was roused at the quarter-pole, moved out inside the
three-sixteenths and lacked the needed kick. ALPINE QUEEN was slow into stride, settled at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, came four wide
into the stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
DR. DEVERA'S WAY just off the pace four then three wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths steadily advancing to take command narrowly just
outside the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat from a trio and inched away kept busy to the finish.
BEACH FRONT chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick to just get up for the place honors. ROAD TO MEATH chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths
advancing in tandem with DR. DEVERA'S WAY to overthrow the leader nearing the quarter pole, continued two to three wide for home, dug in under a drive
weakening in the late stages and was nailed for the place honors on the wire. MISSION WRAPITUP chased three then two wide under a ride from three
furlongs out, swung four wide for home, offered up a mild bid to the furlong grounds then weakened in the late going. NO LIME chased two to three wide
down the backstretch until tucked inside half a mile out, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and passed tired
rivals. INSIDE INFO broke a half a beat slow without incident and was hustled to establish the front just inside six furlongs remaining, showed the way in
hand along the inside, came under pressure from a pair just after the midway point on the turn, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into
upper stretch and tired. FOTIS five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing midway on the turn, angled six wide for home and tired. COBBLE HILL
took the overland route six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn put to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued
widest six to seven paths off the inside at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BIG ENGINE showed early speed then chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, rallied to the lead
inside the furlong marker and proved best under steady urging. JEMOGRAPHY settled on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was asked for his best in
upper stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong and finished willingly for the place while unable to overhaul the winner. RUNNINGWSCISSORS
stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the three path on the turn, gained the advantage just inside the quarter-pole then
was asked for his best, led into the final furlong but weakened and was overtaken but was clear for the show. HONOR UP was urged along towards the
back, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, moved out around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response.
ARISTOCRATIC showed speed and set the pace, vied inside of a foe while along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage just inside the quarter-pole,
dropped back into the final furlong and faltered. FOOLISH GHOST was reluctant to load, stumbled badly at the start and was off slow, moved out at the
rear, was urged five wide on the turn and had nothing left then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

route into upper stretch roused, drew away under a drive holding well to the finish to establish a course record. LOVE AND THUNDER (IRE) got bumped
solidly at the start by the outwards breaking LITTLE LION GIRL and in turn bumped STUNNING MUNNINGS askew conceding three to four lengths to the
front before being able to settle into stride, chased three then two wide from near the rear patiently handled until set down angled three to four wide into
upper stretch, closed well outside to just get up for the place honors in the last jumps to the finish while never able to threaten the winner. MAGICAL SOUL
got bumped at the start by RIVENDELL and in turn brushed FETCHING, chased inside briefly before tipping to the two path down the backstretch, tucked
inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, ran on through to the finish to chase the winner home
and was just bested for the place honors while preserving the show in a three way battle to the line. TOO SEXY broke out at the start filling the space left
vacated by the breaking outwards LITTLE LION GIRL, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and
offered up a mild kick to be among a trio noses apart on the wire in behind the winner. FETCHING brushed at the start by MAGICAL SOUL due to pressure
from RIVENDELL, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch at that station and offered no response. RIVENDELL broke in at the start bumping MAGICAL SOUL into FETCHING, chased three then
two wide in aim of the front under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide at the head of the stretch and weakened in the late stages.
STUNNING MUNNINGS got bumped sideways at the start by LOVE AND THUNDER due to pressure from LITTLE LION GIRL breaking outwards and was
focred to steady briefly conceding two to three lengths to the front, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for
home and made no impact. LITTLE LION GIRL broke out at the start bumping LOVE AND THUNDER solidly into STUNNING MUNNINGS, tucked to chase
along the inside put to coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
CHEROKEE SONG settled off the pace in the two path, moved closer with three furlongs to run, ranged up on the far turn, was asked three wide into the
stretch then bumped by a foe inside the three-sixteenths, took the advantage inside the furlong marker and prevailed under strong urging. KUBIE SNACKS
went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was ridden along while three wide on the far turn, dropped inward in upper stretch, rallied towards
the inside in the final furlong and finished with good energy to get the place. WICKED HAPPY rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the
pace, went four wide while let out on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch and closed well to just miss the place while narrowly up for the show. LADY
THORNHILL broke out at the start, sped clear while hard to rate under tight restraint, lugged out three wide into the first turn then dropped to the two path,
showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside while under some threat on the far turn, was roused at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, drifted
out some and bumped with the winner inside the three-sixteenths, fought on well in the final furlong but just missed the trifecta. SYNONYMOUS broke a
step slow, went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the back, went around the far turn in the three path, swung six wide into upper stretch, moved
out just inside the furlong marker and improved position. ZERENIA saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the back, went around the far turn in the
two path, was roused outside the quarter-pole then driven three wide into the stretch, dropped in inside the furlong marker and also improved position.
ALPHA BABE went around the first turn in the five path, followed the solo leader from second, moved closer late on the backstretch, vied in the four path on
the far turn and tired. LAUGH IT OFF settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, saved ground into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MY
GIRL BLUE settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turns and failed to threaten. DAILY BRIEFING went four to five wide on the turns and faltered.
