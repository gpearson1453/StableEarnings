Footnotes
BRANDOTHEBARTENDER angled to the inside quickly, chased along the fence then angled out on the far turn, came three wide into the drive, tipped out
further in upper stretch, rallied five wide and proved best late. NORTH COUNTY GUY tracked in the two path then moved out three wide on the backstretch,
bid three deep at the quarter pole, took over in upper stretch but got outkicked by the winner in the final sixteenth. ACCLIMATE set the pace from inside,
met bids around the second bend, relinquished control in upper stretch but stayed on from inside and held the show. DESMOND DOSS off a bit slow to
begin then sent between rivals, was closest in pursuit in the two path, bid outside around the far turn, challenged between rivals into and down the stretch,
could not find the needed late kick and got edged for the show. IRISH HEATWAVE settled off the back, angled four wide exiting the turn, six wide in upper
stretch and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
CROOKED FINGER RAY well placed behind the top trio, angled four wide on the turn then chased three deep a quarter mile out, rallied outside PRESS
BRIEFING and got up. PRESS BRIEFING vied for the lead from inside, lost a bit of ground to the top pair entering the turn, asked at the three-eighths,
quickly cleared the outside pair, led into deep stretch and got caught in the closing moments. THREEARCHBAYMAFIA sat off the pace, angled to the inside
on the turn, steered out in upper stretch and finished with late run. WESTERN RULE vied between rivals early, dueled into the turn, chased along the inside
into the drive, shifted in upper stretch and weakened. ZORICH trailed off the inside, went four wide around the turn and failed to menace. ED GATTY
hopped at the start, moved up to vie for the lead three deep up the backstretch, dueled into the turn, chased the leader three then two wide while between
rivals around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
STEELE ROAD came away a bit slow, stalked the leaders from outside, bid alongside STIR THE POT into the turn, dueled in the two path around the bend,
cleared at the three-sixteenths, widened under confident handling and was ridden out to the wire. VERY IRISH chased the the top pair from inside early,
angled outside NAZARE and got floated five wide by that rival around the turn, kept to task in the drive and gained the place. STIR THE POT dueled outside
of NAZARE early, put away that rival at the seven-sixteenth but was met with another challenge from STEELE ROAD, dueled with that foe around the turn
while taking an awkward step at the five-sixteenths pole, lost contact with the winner at the top of the lane and weakened. NAZARE dueled from inside
early, could not keep pace into the turn, drifted out around the bend and also weakened.

Footnotes
SECRET CLUB got bumped from both sides at the start, stalked in the two wide around the first turn, bid past the three-eighths pole, gained the advantage
near the five-sixteenths, dueled with GEORGE HERMAN RUTH in the drive and held gamely. GEORGE HERMAN RUTH was off slow and shifted out at the
start, closed in leaving the backstretch, ranged up three to four wide, dueled with SECRET CLUB in the stretch but faltered late. TABLE FOR TEN came out
leaving the gate, stalked outside a rival, moved into the two on the far turn, tipped out into the stretch and finished evenly for the show. CARMELITA'S MAN
bumped from inside at the start, raced along the inside in range, saved ground into the stretch and gained a clear path at the top of lane but failed to
produce a bid. SABUDA shifted out and bumped rival at the start, sped clear and set the pace inside then in the two path, lost command approaching the
five-sixteenths pole and gave way in the lane. CANYON CREST settled inside, came off the rail into the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
RACE JUDICATA cleared from outside and angled into the two path, set the pace inside of SIMMER DOWN, kicked clear again at the five-sixteenths and
drew off under right-handed urging and steady handling. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH settled off the rail, exited far turn three wide and bested the rest. MAMA
SUPERIOR chased in the two path then moved inside, saved ground into the drive and finished evenly. SIMMER DOWN pulled early outside the pacesetter
to the nine-sixteenths pole, chased two wide to the stretch and faded. OUR LITTLE TIGER unhurried from inside, angled out into the clear on the
backstretch, went four wide around the far turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
SNAZZY DRESSER sped to the front and took control of the rail, set all the pace to the stretch, led clear to the sixteenth pole and narrowly prevailed. FLY
TO MARS bumped from inside leaving the gate, stalked in the two path then moved inside on the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, tipped outside
the leader in the stretch, bid outside late and missed. CAJUN TREASURE traveled in mid-pack while two wide, remained in the two path to the stretch,
could not find needed response in the final furlong but stayed on to secure the show. MOVE OVER (GB) was off a bit slow to begin, unhurried from inside,
moved into the two path on the backstretch, came with a mild rally late and missed the show. FRENCH GETAWAY raced outside a rival from off the pace,
came two wide into the drive and failed to rally. CAMINO DE ESTRELLA raced in the two path around the clubhouse turn, settled along the inside on the
backstretch, saved ground into the lane and made no impact. SKY CONFIDENTIAL broke out and bumped rival, forwardly placed in the two path, came
three wide into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
FLIGHTLINE bumped with MONEY MIKE at the start, set the pace under pressure, kicked clear and padded the lead around the turn, then widened through
the lane while confidently ridden to the wire. BRUTTO pressed the pace between rivals, chased two then three wide around the bend and bested the rest.
NAISMITH showed early speed between foes then dropped back to chase, saved ground into the drive and finished a clear third. EPIDEMIC stalked outside
a rival, went three wide into the turn, angled out into the five path around the bend briefly then entered the stretch four wide and never rallied. MONEY MIKE
bumped outside rival at the start, chased along the inside, steadied at the half-mile marker then again at the seven-sixteenths, remained inside to the stretch
and lacked a rally. SECRET WEAPON was off slow at the start, went up between rivals, came two wide into the drive and weakened. WINHAPPY broke
out, attended the pace outside the top pair, dropped back around the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
AS TIME GOES BY sped to the front, set the pace in the two path, angled in entering the second bend, kicked clear at the three-eighths, drew off under mild
hand urging and was ridden out late. THIS TEA unhurried in the beginning, saved ground through both turns and rallied for the place. HARVEST MOON
was up close outside the winner through the early stages, could not keep pace past the three-eighths pole, chased two wide to the stretch and got
outfinished for the place. PHAROAH'S HEART was off a bit slow to begin, hustled then steadied behind rivals early, chased two wide the moved into the
three path, remained off the rail into the drive and had little left. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE raced off the pace outside a rival to the five-sixteenths, came
three wide into the stretch and never made an impact.

Footnotes
LADY NOGUEZ reserved in the early going and moved into the two path, went between foes on the backstretch, angled out and came four wide into the
stretch, rallied five wide and reeled in the runner-up late. GOODTINGSCOMINPINK stalked the leader from the two path, bid between at the three-eighths,
took over near the five-sixteenths, cleared outside rival with a furlong to go but could not hold off the winner in the final strides. UNBREAKABLE got
sandwiched between runners at the start, tucked inside then eased out into the backstretch, unleashed a bid nearing the far turn, vied three deep around
the bend but flattened in the late stages. PRANCE raced outside a rival while in range, came three wide into the drive, drifted inward in the lane and kept on
to fill out the superfecta. DYNAPOWER broke out and bumped with rival twice in the beginning, unhurried in the early going from inside, moved into the two
path and went outside a rival on the second bend, then passed tired rivals in the stretch run. LET'S GO NOW got bumped from both sides leaving the gate,
sped clear and controlled the pace, lost command near the five-sixteenths and weakened in the lane. OLE SILVER hopped and got pinballed at the start,
stalked on the inside, steadied briefly around the far turn and weakened. BASIL FLAVOR raced outside rivals then moved into the two path, went outside
rivals again on the backstretch, angled five into the lane and could not rally.

Footnotes
KRISTI'S TIGER reserved off the inside, got floated out into the stretch, angled out further in the stretch and closed fast to inhale the runner-up. D'S
LOVELY SOPHIA threw her head at the start, sped to the front from inside, cleared outside rival to take full control, showed the way in the two path into the
stretch, lugged out and took the path of ROCKIE CAUSEWAY late and got caught. THAT'S AMARE stalked the pace between foes, checked at the
three-eighths pole, stayed two wide to the stretch and finished willingly for the show. BELLA D unhurried in the early going, saved ground around the turn
and finished with a mild rally to earn a minor award. SHYLOCK EDDIE in range early along the inside, cut the corner into the stretch and could not produce
a bid. DR WYSONG tracked the pace inside rivals, moved off the rail then got squeezed between rivals mid-stretch and could not regain momentum. I'LL
DO IT FOR YOU stumbled and bumped inside rival at the start, settled off the pace outside rivals, went three deep around the turn, came out into the lane,
lugged in upper stretch then altered around the fallen rider late. PEACE PIPE tracked off the inside then between rivals, steadied off heels entering the turn,
then lacked a rally in the stretch run. NAVY QUEEN showed early speed then chased outside the pacesetter, drifted out and bumped rival into the stretch,
got bothered by ROCKIE CAUSEWAY and checked in upper stretch and weakened. ROCKIE CAUSEWAY bumped leaving the gate, stalked three deep,
angled out leaving the turn, bumped by rival entering the lane, lugged in upper stretch, was forced out then lost her path and stumbled, causing her to
unseat the rider nearing the wire. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED D'S LOVELY SOPHIA FROM SECOND AND PLACED
HER UNPLACED FOR LUGGING OUT AND TAKING THE PATH OF ROCKIE CAUSEWAY, CAUSING HER TO STUMBLE AND LOSE THE RIDER
NEARING THE WIRE.
