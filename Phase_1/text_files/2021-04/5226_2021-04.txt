Footnotes
BLUSHING BAY was unhurried to the second turn, advanced two wide to the stretch, kept TOTALLY NORMAL boxed in nearing mid stretch, edged away
then held under steady handling. TOTALLY NORMAL had no speed, trailed to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch while rallying then was boxed in
behind rivals nearing the furlong marker, took back slightly and angled out then closed fast but too late. SENORITA ESTRELLA was allowed to settle to the
second turn, raced two wide to the stretch but was not a threat to the top two. DARLING DEMON hustled to contest the pace under quick fractions, stayed
on for six furlongs then tired. OURSENSATIONALGIRL was outside of DARLING DEMON on that quick pace, began to tire after six furlongs and gave out in
the final furlong.

Footnotes
MALIBU JEWEL was quickly in front, set the pace from the two path to the stretch then kicked away to mid stretch and held driving. STEIN'S GIRL had no
speed, settled to the second turn, bid four wide to the stretch then could not impact the winner but caught HANDCUFFED for the place. HANDCUFFED was
hard to place on the first turn, tracked the winner to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch, got outkicked by the winner and could not hold second.
HASTA LUEGO pressed the pace three wide early, was asked for more two wide on the second turn but got outrun to mid stretch and tired. SHE'S
EXPENSIVE trailed for six furlongs while three wide then swung out widest for the stretch run but was not a factor. DIVALICIOUS had no speed, settled for
a half mile, was two wide to the stretch then gave way. KRISTIN'S PICNIC was rank inside the winner into the first turn, checked then chased that one for
five furlongs, tired then stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHOT OF A LIFETIME pushed up four wide to take the lead on the first turn, set the pace to the second turn, was two wide and met bids from three rivals,
dug in tenaciously through the stretch and held. MANILA MISCHIEF was four wide to the backstretch then was rank while widest leaving the five eighths,
rallied when asked into the second turn but had to circle five wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then held the place. BABY FRANKIE tracked
the pace to the half, offered a bid four wide on the second turn but was outrun to mid stretch and finished evenly. UNLAWFUL ACT had no speed, saved
ground on the second turn but could only pick off rivals in the drive. SIZZLING JAMIE stalked the winner to the second turn, bid three wide and loomed a
threat into the stretch but was also outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. MEGAMEISTER pressed the pace three wide to the second turn, got outkicked
to the stretch and weakened. ANGELO'S PRIDE had no speed, was two then three wide on the second turn and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
FABRIANA was unhurried to the half, rallied two then three wide to the stretch, continued to respond in the drive and dug in determinedly to wear down
SIDE EFFECT (GB) late. SIDE EFFECT (GB) The latter pressed the action to the second turn, rallied two wide to engage for the lead, inched away to mid
stretch then battled on late but was caught. MULHIMA (IRE) stalked the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide to contest the pace to the stretch then
got outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. AMERICAN ROYALTY had no speed, settled towards the rear, was two wide on the second turn but did not
threaten in the stretch run. HAL'S BUDDY trailed to the second turn, swung out four wide to the stretch but also lacked the needed late response. FLASHY
PASS set the pace to the second turn then tired, stopped in the stretch, was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

BIG IRISH EYES was crowded and took up early, trailed to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch and finished in a steady rally to be along in
time. REALLY EASY contested the pace outside THEY'RE GRRREAT and three wide to the stretch, battled doggedly through a long drive and was nailed in
the final strides.. MESSIAH THE GREAT stalked the pace to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task and
was closing well. THEY'RE GRRREAT hustled to dueled for the lead inside the runnerup, battled that one determinedly through a long drive but was being
outfinished late. TALISKER BAY got outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then was making up ground between rivals late. HEFTY GARCIA
chased the leaders from the rail to the stretch, was also outrun to mid stretch then was gaining ground belatedly. STORMY THUNDER had no speed, raced
three then four wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive.
