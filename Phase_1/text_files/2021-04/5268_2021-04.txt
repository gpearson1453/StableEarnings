Footnotes
UNION GAP dueled two wide between rivals down the backstretch, was unable to keep pace with MIGHTY TOUGH around the turn, inherited a substantial
lead when that rival ducked out and lost the rider near the three-eighths pole and held clear under a drive. MUTAKAAMIL raced off the pace outside, was
under a drive from the seven-sixteenths pole, raced four wide around the turn and was gaining outside late. MACHO REAL vied inside early, chased inside
around the far turn and held for the show. READTHETRANSCRIPT saved ground and failed to menace. CHOSEN FEW had brief speed four wide.
WILLIAM BOY was outrun outside. MIGHTY TOUGH dueled three wide down the backstretch, drew clear nearing the three-eighths pole, opened up a three
length lead nearing the lane, ducked out under left-handed urging and unseated the rider near the three-sixteenths pole. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED
AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
CULTURED was off a bit slow, settled in midpack inside, angled four wide near the quarter pole, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, soon cleared and
held firm under a drive. VINTAGE STYLE settled off the early pace two wide, edged closer three wide around most of the far turn, came five wide into the
lane and finished willingly outside of the winner. CHAMPAGNE IVY saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and rallied mildly between foes to
gain the show. KNOW HOW (GB) stalked the pace inside early, bid three wide around the far turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, led to midstretch and
weakened. DREAM ABOUT ME bobbled at the break, saved ground well back, went three wide around the far turn and had some belated interest.
FOXTROT SEVILLE failed to menace while racing two and three wide. ENDLESS FRONT pressed the pace in the three path and tired nearing the lane.
KITTEN TALES was outrun inside. SWEET ACTRESS played no factor while saving ground. NEVER AT ALL (FR) set a rated pace in the two path and
faltered nearing the lane.

Footnotes
YES THIS TIME saved ground in midpack for a half, advanced three wide around the far turn, seized command in midstretch and powered clear under
left-handed urging. THE RIGHT STUFF (GB) was forced out entering the first turn, angled back into the two path soon after, stalked the pace two wide, took
the lead near the quarter pole, battled on between foes past the eighth pole and was clearly second best late. ADVANCE CASH broke outwardly, set the
pace along the rail, battled on midstretch, bobbled leaving the eighth pole and settled for third best. BROADWAY was bumped at the start and never
threatened while racing two and three wide. TIO MAGICO got out entering the first turn, was up close inside while continuing to fight the rider and try to get
out down the backstretch and around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. BOCA GUY hit the starting gate, was forced wide into the first turn, raced
mostly three wide around that bend, saved ground around the far turn and lacked a rally. LIKEABLE was pinched back at the start, steadied entering the first
turn, was forced out early on the bend, chased two wide around most of that turn, went four wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. CAXAMBAS
CANDY was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace early, made a slight gain under a drive four wide around the far turn and tired in the lane.
COWBOY AT HEART was bumped at the start, was forced out entering the first turn, raced in range three wide early and was through after a half.

CHAMPAGNE SALUTE stalked the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, was soon confronted by FLASHY TOO, battled on inside of that
foe through the lane and was edging ahead late. FLASHY TOO advanced inside around the turn, angled three wide nearing the quarter pole, reached near
even terms outside of the winner in upper stretch, dueled through the lane and was outfinished. HITECH IS BACK set the pace along the rail and gave way
nearing the quarter pole. POTION was through after a half.

Footnotes
DRAMATIC KITTEN saved ground in midpack, split rivals in upper stretch, struck the front near the eighth pole and drove clear. FEAR THE DEER was in
range inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, was floated five wide into the lane and gained the place without threatening the winner. COUCH
DREAMS was slammed on both sides a few strides out of the gate and knocked off balance, was bumped again soon after, raced off the pace two wide,
tipped out in upper stretch and ran on for the show. DREAM OF ANFIELD bumped with COUH DREAMS soon after the start, stalked the pace two wide, bid
nearing the lane, drifted out entering the stretch, vied to midstretch and weakened. MR. EINSTEIN saved ground off the pace, went four wide around the far
turn and never threatened. TRUE IDENTITY set the pace along the rail and gave way near the quarter pole. GANDOLFO bumped COUCH DREAMS soon
after the start, saved ground and played no further factor. MARISA'S MISSION was fractious pre-race and made little impact while racing four and five wide.
LIAMS STAR tracked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. CURVE played no factor while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
GEMO settled off the pace, swung four wide approaching the stretch, had clear sailing outside and overhauled a battling threesome to win going away.
DECKOLOGY dueled outside BABY BROTHER early, continued to fight on between that one and THE REIGN MAN past the five-sixteenths and into the
stretch, came out late under left-hand pressure brushing THE REIGN MAN, and dug in for the place. THE REIGN MAN bumped with CASH NOW at the
start, ranged up to join the dueling leaders three wide near the five-sixteenths, held a slight lead through the furlong grounds outside DECKOLOGY, got
brushed and pushed out late and yielded second. BABY BROTHER dueled inside DECKOLOGY from the start, fought on as they were joined by THE
REIGN MAN on the turn and into the stretch, was in tight briefly along the rail leaving the furlong grounds, and weakened late. FLAMING HOT broke slowly,
moved inside around the turn, and never reached contention. CASH NOW bumped with THE REIGN MAN at the start, and shifted out five wide tiring after a
half-mile. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF BABY BROTHER AGAINST DECKOLOGY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT
ALLOWED.

MRS. MAISEL advanced with a four-wide bid after a half-mile, battled outside rivals through midstretch, edged away with 50 yards remaining and held off a
late challenger. ABARRIO FOREVER saved ground outsprinted early, swung to the far outside coming off the turn, and was getting to the winner on the far
outside late. MS BIG SPRING vied inside from the start, dug in through a long drive and yielded grudgingly 70 yards out. RAIN moved up behind the leaders
in the two-path after a half, tipped out for clearance with a furlong to go, and finished one-paced. CLASSY BEAST tracked outside the leaders three wide
into the turn, reached the front coming to the quarter-pole, and battled on through midstretch before giving way. BLESSED BEAST was always outrun.
AKOR was through before reaching the stretch. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA broke a step slow, rushed through to contest the early pace outside MS BIG
SPRING, and was empty on the turn.

BRAMBLE BERRY was under a drive by midway on the turn three wide behind a pace duel, stayed on task through the lane and overhauled the leaders
from outside in the closing yards. CAFFEINE RUSH became agitated dislodging the rider in the gate prior to the start, came away in good order and dueled
inside rivals early, battled inside SHES ALL WOMAN around the turn and into the stretch, drifted out late and held for the place. SHES ALL WOMAN argued
the pace outside rivals early, dueled outside CAFFEINE RUSH around the turn and into the stretch, and weakened past the sixteenth-pole. LEVY LAND
broke slowly and was outrun. GITANA became fractious in the gate sending the rider flying out the back of the stall prior to the start, came away without
further incident and showed early speed between horses, and stopped soon after completing a quarter-mile.

Footnotes
PLAYERA began to close in on the leaders four wide on the turn, took over outside COMPETTI in upper stretch and drew clear, and widened while lugging
in. COMPETTI sprinted clear early, withstood a challenge from PIPER approaching the stretch, could not handle PLAYERA once straightened away, and
ran on second best. TRINNI GIRLS was outrun early, improved position around the turn four wide, and was along for the show outside. PIPER pursued
COMPETTI from outside early, challenged around the turn, and faded through the stretch. BELLA GABRIELLA tired inside. KAYLA'S TUNE saved ground
and was no factor. MISS CONSTITUTION was finished early outside. DANCING EMPRESS veered out at the start, and trailed far back throughout while
wide.
