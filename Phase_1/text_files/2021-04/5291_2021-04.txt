on the leaders three wide, drifted in and bothered both foes and edged clear of them in the final stages. BETTYB tracked the pace early, made a bid from
between horses nearing the lane, was under a long drive in the stretch from the inside, was then bumped and bothered and held place in the final stages.
MATT'S HONEY chased the pace early on, made a bid three wide nearing the lane, took over and inched ahead down the lane under a long drive, was then
bumped and bothered while between horses and yielded late in the drive. MALIBU MOIRA raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane, rallied
and made a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. LADY KAZA set the pace early along the rail, stayed on the inside into the lane and gave

Footnotes
NAKATOMI tracked the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, wore down the leader down the lane and cleared the field in hand in the final stages.
HAPPY SOUL set the pace from the outset, was in the three path into the lane, remained clear down the lane but was worn down and no match for the
winner in the final stages. ATTA BOY ANTHONY raced back early on, was in the six path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. KNOCKER DOWN
was a bit slow at the start, raced along the six path into the lane and improved position in the stretch drive. LT. FINN chased the pace early along the inside,
came out and bothered foe near the quarter pole, was in the three path into the lane and faded down the lane. BAYTOWN WARRIOR took a awkward step
at the start and no factor thereafter. ABOUT TO RAGE was bumped entering the lane. JR'S GIFT was never a threat. WARRIOR WORRIER was never a
factor. CHEYENNE WIND was a bit slow and raced extremely wide into the lane and down the lane. VALIANT CHARGE was bothered entering the lane.

STAND TALL vied for the lead two wide and from between horses, inched clear from those rivals in upper stretch as PETER'S KITTEN produced a bid, but
safely held sway from that one to the wire. PETER'S KITTEN stalked her trio of rivals from along the inside, shifted off of the rail into the far turn, then
outside of her foes at the five sixteenths grounds to make a bid entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with STAND TALL approaching the furlong pole,
and chased her home to prove second best. MYLASTFIRSTKISS prompted the pace three wide, vied around the far turn, but yielded between horses
approaching the furlong pole. LINNY KATE set the pace while feeling pressure from a pair of outer foes, but was headed by those rivals at the five
sixteenths pole, and weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
HIGH FASHION saved ground off of the pace, advanced along the rail around the far turn to loom large behind the leaders while in hand turning for home,
slipped through a rail opening in upper stretch, and drove clear a furlong from home. SEASCAPE set the pace inside of the pressing DEEMED ESSENTIAL,
stayed a path off of the inner railing while showing the way around the far turn, but allowed HIGH FASHION to produce a rail bid in upper stretch by doing
so, got headed by that foe approaching the three sixteenths pole, then chased that rival home while safely holding place. DEEMED ESSENTIAL bobbled at
the start but was not costed early positioning, prompted the pace setter two wide, got kept in the three path by that foe around the far turn, but was
outkicked by a ground saving rival in upper stretch, and chased him home while failing to catch SEASCAPE for place. LEGENDARY GIFT tracked while
forwardly placed three wide, took the far turn in the four path, but failed to keep pace with inner foes in upper stretch. TAKE CHARGE PATTI stalked along
the inside, then two wide and from between horses around the far turn, but failed to produce a bid through the lane. RUNAWAY MOM saved ground far off
of the pace, but to no avail. CAUSEWAY PRINCESS was outrun. TONE MY BETTY was reluctant to load, then done early.

HIS GLORY prompted the pace two wide, vied into the far turn, forged an advantage with a quarter mile to go, cleared off in upper stretch with JOY
EPIFORA (ARG) in pursuit, dug in inside of that foe passing the furlong marker, and gamely held to the wire. JOY EPIFORA (ARG) stalked along the inside,
shifted off of the rail into the far turn before tipping outside of the leading duo turning for home, pursued HIS GLORY through upper stretch before inching
closer to spark a duel with that foe passing the furlong marker, but was denied victory by his inner counterpart. FINAL CUT set the pace along the inside
while feeling pressure from HIS GLORY, came under a drive into the far turn to cling to an advantage from that foe, but was headed at the five sixteenths
pole, and weakened entering the lane. PER THE KENTUCKY RACING COMMISSION, JOY EPIFORA (ARG) HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE
TEST.

Footnotes
VERIFIED set the pace along the inside, drew clear in upper stretch, and held from the rallying FAST BOB late. FAST BOB lied off of the pace along the
inside, swung four wide turning for home, rallied through the lane to produce a late bid, but missed. KIERKEGAARD lied off of the pace in the three to four
path around the turn, got floated five wide turning for home, then stayed on while hanging on his left lead. INSPECTOR FROST chased three wide, but was
outkicked by outer rivals at the furlong grounds, then kept on. PETIT VERDOT vied for the lead two wide, but faded in upper stretch. AUTOPILOT chased
along the inside, but faded through the lane. MAGIC CARPET was never involved. HATS OFF TOO YOU and RAPHAEL were outrun.
