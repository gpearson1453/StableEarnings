Footnotes
DANCE ON OVER settled off the early pace while off the inside, advanced through the three then four path through the turn, was three wide into the lane
with momentum, gained the lead when straightening then drew away while being kept to the task. VARTON set the pace while near the inside through the
turn, was no match for the winner entering the lane but kept on well to remain clearly for the place spot. PI YO PRINCESS chased the pace from the two
path through the turn, moved two wide and between rivals into the lane, could not keep up with the winner then flattened out nearing the sixteenth pole to
settle for the show spot. HARD TO ACCESS was never a factor while racing near the inside into the lane. AYKIZ chased the pace from along the inside
through the turn and into the lane and was empty inside the eighth pole. COOKIE JAR was in the two path through the turn and was never in it.

Footnotes
TAPJEN chased the pace from the three path into the turn, moved up on the leader with minimal urging approaching the quarter pole, gained a clear lead
straightening into the lane then was ridden out to the wire while widening the advantage. CAN'T TOUCH ME was in the three to the two path through the
turn when unhurried, continued with energy into the lane then ran down the place rival while not a threat to the winner. DIRTY DIXIE ROAD was in the five
path and four wide in mid-turn, continued in the four path into the lane then moved up for the minor share. QUE SERA SERA set the pace through the turn
when in the two path, was no match for the winner after straightening in the lane then could not hold the next two rivals safe. CUBBIE BEAR chased the
pace from the four to the three path through the turn then tired in the lane. LUCY TOO was done early while near the inside. LA COYOTA was along the
inside through the turn and was always last.

TREATY OF PARIS settled off the pace while moving through the four and three path through the first, continued off the inside into the far turn, moved to
stalk the three rivals duel in mid-turn, bid four wide into the lane, quickly cleared then widened to the end under a drive. RUN WITH GRACE pressed the
pace while two wide down the backstretch and into the far turn, was asked for more in mid-turn, continued to duel with two others into the lane while winner
moved past on outside, and edged up for the place spot late. WICKED BISOU set the pace along the inside into the far turn, was joined on both sides by
rivals in mid-turn, continued to duel with those two through the lane while still in between then could only manage to save the minor share. MISS BETTE
LUTE tracked the pace while along the inside into the far turn, bid along the rail approaching the three-eighths pole then yielded to others inside the
sixteenth pole. ANGEL DE CORA was in the five path through the first turn, chased the field through the far turn, angled widest into the lane and lacked a
response.

MOMOS HUMOR unhurried while off the inside, moved through the three and four path on the turn when getting closer, bid three wide into the lane, dueled
with another inside the eighth pole and cleared late. CROSSED THE LINE chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid with the winner into the
lane and between rivals, dueled to inside the eighth pole then could not keep up. CRUZIN TATUM set the pace while in the two path through the turn, was
closer to the rail when on near even terms with two others after straightening in the lane then yielded to those. FREEDOM BOUND was never a serious
threat while saving ground. SUPERVISE never a factor while in the two path into the lane. EMMYRATES raced in the two path through the turn and steadily
faded.

Footnotes
NAUGHTY ALFRED pressed the pacesetter two wide and in the three path through the turn, swung into the lane in the five path with good momentum, was
asked for more when straightened, drew clear and widened to the wire. FLOWERPECKER chased the two rival duel through the turn, angled into the five or
six path into the lane, could not keep up with the winner but kept on well to finish second best. DILETTANTE was off awkwardly but then hustled up to
contend for the lead, taken in hand and let to shuffle back on the run down the backstretch, continued in the two or three path through the turn and moved
up for the show spot while not a serious threat. COMFORT ME NOW was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, continued in the two or three
path after straightening in the lane then moved up while not a serious menace. CHANGE DIRECTION was along the inside through the turn and into the
lane and was never a threat. TAPIT'S SPIRIT was in the four path through the turn when never far back, swung into the seven path into the lane and tired
through the final eighth. WAR ACT set the pace along the inside then gave way. SOLITAIRE GAME was in the two path through the turn and was always
last.

SUDDEN SHIFT pressed the pace four wide into the turn, continued in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path when dueling for
the top spot then edged clear through the final eighth. SKY JUDGE set the early pace along the inside, was shuffled back through the turn while remaining
on the inside, came again through the final eighth and was clear for the place spot. FASHION NUGGET was in the three path through the turn when lacking
speed, came into the lane from the six path and was all out to the wire to just get up for the show spot. ROCKIN ALL NIGHT raced in the three or four path
through the turn, came into the lane in good position and finished evenly. NATES HEARTTHROB was along the inside into the turn, came off the rail for the
drive and gained belatedly. MELTDOWN set the pace into the lane while under pressure then gave way. BRAVO EXPRESS bid five wide through late turn,
came into the lane from the six path and flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. MIGHTY CONTENDER was in the four path through the turn, came into the
lane from the seven path and was never a serious threat. PARKER was in the four path through the turn when well back, swung into the lane from the nine
path and never factored. KENTUCKY SKY chased the pace from the three path through the turn and was empty turning into the lane. OUR NEIGHBOR
BOYS was slow to gather and never was in it.

Footnotes
REAL MISS PRADO was unrushed early, rallied four wide at the quarter pole and was clear late under steady urging. STOPSHOPINGKAREN dueled inside
of CECILIA'S HOPE but the pair couldn't hold off the winner. MISS FORT had a mild late bid in the two path, then was no threat. WANTING stalked the
pace in the two and three paths, then faded in the stretch. SEXY PORK CHOP saved ground to no avail. HOUSE KEEPER and. BICKERMENTS were not
factors. HASHTAG TOO FAST faded stretch.

WEST WARPATH was patient in the two path, angled four wide in the stretch, rallied, dueled late outside of the leader and was up in time. CONUNDRUM
pressed the pace in the four path, led late, dueled inside of the winner and was outfinished. EL CASADORA pressed between foes early, rated, angled to
the rail late and couldn't make a bid. HURRY ON OUT raced evenly in the three path. SOUTHERN RAGS saved ground, then had a mild late bid outside.
YANKEE MISCHIEF pressed the pace in the three path, then gave way in the stretch. NATIONAL ROAD showed brief speed inside. RENATO raced evenly.
MISTER MAN was off awkwardly. TRADEOFF was not a factor. INTEND was clear at the quarter pole, stumbled at the sixteenth pole and was wrapped up
on for the final yards.
