Footnotes
PACKED HOUSE was placed on the lead, vied inside of MR. ESTES past the eleven sixteenths when that one confronted him, continued to dispute the
pace through the far turn, edged clear in upper stretch as MR. ESTES came out, and drove decisively clear in the final furlong. MR. ESTES was bumped
between horses in the opening strides, tracked the pace through the clubhouse turn, pulled past the eleven sixteenths to confront outside of PACKED
HOUSE, vied outside him from there through the far turn and into upper stretch, drifted out under left handed urging in upper stretch, could not keep pace
with PACKED HOUSE in the final furlong but held for place. SEMI CHARMED DAY broke inward, raced at the inside of the rear flight through the clubhouse
turn, improved position past the eleven sixteenths, tracked the leading pair in the two path on the far turn, was driven past the three eighths, loomed inside
of PACKED HOUSE in upper stretch, lacked the needed kick to challenge him, flattened out from midstretch but salvaged the show. LINE OF DENHAMS
bumped with SIN CITY SLICK in the opening strides, chased midpack through the clubhouse turn inside of SQUIRRELY MIKE, continued midfield down the
backstretch and while saving ground through the far turn, was taken out and driven in the five path in upper stretch, and chased on evenly. DARK WOOD
(IRE) broke inward, settled between horses in the rear flight through the clubhouse turn, continued in the rear flight inside of SIN CITY SLICK for the
backstretch run, raced in the four path on the far turn in the rear pair of the main pack, went to a drive in upper stretch, but mustered no rally. SIN CITY
SLICK bumped between MR. ESTES and SQUIRRELY MIKE in the opening strides, raced three wide in the rear flight on the far turn, continued with the
rear group down the backstretch, raced in the five path at the rear of the main pack around the far turn, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, offered no
response into the lane, and was not persevered with late. SQUIRRELY MIKE broke inward and bumped MR. ESTES in the opening strides, raced keenly
while chasing outside horses through the clubhouse turn, pulled to track the pace outside MR. ESTES into the backstretch, steadily lost ground from the
eleven sixteenths, lost touch with the field into the far turn and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
TINDERELLA dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, opened up from the field alongside that rival, saved ground around the turn and
continued to race gamely down the lane, pulling clear in the final sixteenth of a mile. HEY HEY dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch and
around the turn, well ahead of the rest of the field, entered the stretch in the two path, continued to duel down the stretch and gave way late. DEVIL'S ROSE
settled well off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, took up the chase of the frontrunners from the two path around the turn, and continued to make
up ground in the stretch, but ran out of room to threaten. WAY TOO SMARTE settled off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile,
dropped back slightly while saving ground around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch. LADY EXPRESS broke slowly, trailed the field in the opening
stages, began to move up from the two path around the turn and flattened out in the final furlong. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN raced at the back of the pack the
entire way around the oval, came around the turn in the two path and offered no bid. PRAISEM raced at the back of the pack on the outside throughout,
navigated the turn from the three path and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHELL FIRE tracked the leader two wide through the clubhouse turn, continued in range of the pacesetter down the backstretch, chased the pacesetter in
the two to three path on the far turn, went to a drive past the three eighths when passed by FORT RAMSEY, was taken three wide in upper stretch, raced
three to four wide into the final furlong, fought on four wide late and was up in the final jumps. FORT RIDGE settled near the rear inside horses through the
clubhouse turn, continued in second last down the backstretch, improved in the two path around the far turn, was driven inside in upper stretch, shifted out
past the three sixteenths, rallied three wide between horses, headed DRIVER DAN with about forty yards remaining but was narrowly outfinished for the
win. FORT RAMSEY raced between horses toward the rear through the clubhouse turn, improved between horses in tandem with ANDREAS past the three
quarters, raced in between horses in the chasing flight from the eleven sixteenths, bid in the three to four path on the far turn, sustained his pursuit outside
of DRIVER DAN under a drive in the lane, but was outkicked between horses. PISTOL BOX was unhurried well behind the main pack, went to a drive in the
three path on the far turn and began to take closer order, swung into the seven path into upper stretch, and offered a mild outside rally. DRIVER DAN broke
inward, was sent for speed, set an uncontested pace, saved ground through the far turn, continued on the lead while driven from upper stretch, clung to the
lead inside the final furlong, but was headed near forty yards out and weakened. ANDREAS raced three wide toward the rear through the clubhouse turn,
improved three wide in tandem with FORT RAMSEY past the three quarters, chased three wide down the backstretch and in the four to five path through
the far turn, went to a drive in upper stretch but began to weaken from the three sixteenths. LEAD STAR tracked the leading pair inside through the
clubhouse turn, raced at the inside of the chasing flight down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn but was outpaced from the three eighths.

Footnotes
UPHAM led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the rail around the far turn, kicked
clear entering the stretch and was kept to the task to the wire. POCKET PLAYER raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch
at the back of the pack, angled in to save ground around the far turn, launched a bid approaching the three sixteenths pole and improved position on the rail
down the stretch, never threatening the winner. EDISON FIRE chased the frontrunner from the two path around the first turn, moved up to press the pace on
the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, began a proper challenge nearing the five sixteenths pole, was outkicked
in upper stretch and finished evenly on the outside from there. TALKIN MALICE saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, entered the stretch still in striking position and weakened between horses in the final furlong.
HIGH SPIRITS was bumped by the horse to his outside leaving the gate and forced to steady, raced wide around the first turn at the back of the pack,
dropped back further to trail well behind the field up the backstretch and around the far turn, entered the stretch in the three path and passed tiring horses
from there. CLOUD TO GROUND hopped up leaving the gate, recovered to race in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the
middle of the pack, came around the far turn in the three path and faded in the stretch. TOM'S LAST GENERAL swerved out and bumped with the horse to
his outside leaving the gate, raced in the three and four path around the first turn, settled in to stalk the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, navigated
the second turn from the two path and tired in the stretch.

DARLIN ROSIE raced at the inside of the chasing line down the backstretch, chased along the rail around the turn, rallied inside into the lane, was taken
two wide in upper stretch, rallied between horses, struck the front near the three sixteenths, and edged clear of ORDAINED KISS. The latter raced two wide
in the chasing line down the backstretch, tracked behind the leading line in the three path on the turn, was taken three wide into upper stretch for her bid,
kept on willingly in the final furlong but was outfinished by the winner. SUPERSTAR DIVA chased four deep near the center of the track down the
backstretch, continued to chase in the four path on the turn, swung out six wide in upper stretch, never challenged the leading pair but rallied on outside
foes to prove best of the rest. RACHELGOTSTEPHEN was a bit slow into stride, settled well off the pace for the backstretch run, trailed in the five path on
the turn, swung out eight wide in upper stretch and passed outside of tiring horses. FIRST SQUADRON vied between horses in the leading line down the
backstretch and through the turn, was driven four wide in upper stretch, remained in range to midstretch but came up empty in the final furlong. LIL B
QUICK vied at the inside of a three-horse leading line down the backstretch and through the turn, kept on under a drive in upper stretch, but emptied out
past the three sixteenths. BODEMAX raced three deep in the chasing line while near the center of the track down the backstretch, was pushed along from
midpack in the five to six path on the turn, came six to seven wide in upper stretch, and weakened. HELEN MAE'S SONG vied on the pace three wide,
proved no match for the rest of the leading flight past the quarter pole, had no response when driven in upper stretch and faded.

CANDY STORE raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, moved up on the leaders approaching
the far turn, was blocked and forced to steady slightly just past the half mile pole, recovered to save ground around the far turn, found an opening on the rail
entering the stretch, pulled clear with a furlong to go and extended his lead to the wire, much the best. KREWE CHIEF saved ground around the first turn,
came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid from the three eighths pole, entered the stretch in the four path and chased
the eventual winner home, the best of the rest. CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT hit the gate leaving it, raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed well behind
the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and improved position in the stretch. STALLONE saved ground around the first turn, led the
field on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and faded between horses in the final furlong. MARKET ANALYSIS raced in the
two path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn between horses in the three path and tired in
the stretch. DUE TO A TIMER ERROR, THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
FLORIDA FLASH chased five wide down the backstretch, took closer order while still racing four wide on the turn, turned five wide into the lane and went to
a drive, sustained his rally, vied outside of IRISH LIGHTED ROAD past the furlong pole, and edged clear in the final sixteenth. IRISH LIGHTED ROAD
pressed the pace outside of MR. SPRINGTIME down the backstretch, disputed the pace through the turn, went to a drive two wide in upper stretch, fought
his way to a narrow lead midstretch, vied inside of FLORIDA FLASH to the sixteenth, but weakened late. DISTINCT THUNDER tracked well behind the
leading pair three wide between horses early, continued to track three wide on the turn, went to a drive in range behind the leaders in upper stretch, was
outkicked by FLORIDA FLASH into the final furlong, but kept on earnestly and missed the place. OFF TO THE BEACH settled in second last, saved ground
through the turn while still racing patiently, was driven two to three wide for the stretch bid and offered a mild rally through horses. MR. SPRINGTIME was
hustled for speed, set the early pace while pressured by IRISH LIGHTED ROAD down the backstretch, dueled inside that foe around the turn, went to a
drive in upper stretch, proved no match for IRISH LIGHTED ROAD approaching midstretch, and weakened inside. WAR TRAIL chased three wide between
horses down the backstretch, settled back toward the rear into the turn, raced in the four path around the bend while pushed along, fanned six wide into
upper stretch, and lacked the needed kick when asked in the lane. POCHO'S DREAM broke outward and soon trailed, raced at the rear in the three path on
the turn, swung out into the lane in the seven path, and passed outside tiring horses. BOOGY SOKS was reluctant to load, tracked well behind the leading
pair between horses, saved ground through the turn while racing midfield, went to a drive inside in upper stretch but offered no response and weakened.
FELIXNITETRAINCOLE tracked the leading pair inside of DISTINCT THUNDER early, raced at the inside of the chasing flight into the turn, but began to
fade from the three eighths and had nothing further for the drive.
