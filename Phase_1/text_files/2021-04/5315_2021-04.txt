PRINCE ALI broke well and assumed command two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide into the turn and fully cleared midway through the turn,
entered stretch clear and kept to task and easily proved best. LUCKY ROMANO tracked leader along the inside on the backstretch, continued saving
ground into the turn, bid in late in the turn and split rivals at the top of the stretch, responded well to urging and gained on leader to the wire. HYDROSTATIC
broke in and bumped rival at the start, chased leader three wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, launched bid four wide into the stretch and kept
to task to hold show. CASH ENCOUNTER settled off the pace along the rail on the backstretch, continued to save ground through the turn, launched mild
rally two wide in the stretch and bested rest. CALIENTE SHUFFLE pressed leader along the inside on the backstretch, continued to hold the rail into the
turn, entered stretch in range of leader and gave way in the final sixteenth. FANCY TERRACE bumped by rival at the start, tracked leader two wide on the
backstretch, entered turn two wide and had awkward strides on the turn and lost ground, and coasted into the finish.
