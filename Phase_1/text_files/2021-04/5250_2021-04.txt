HOLDING FAST lunged at the break but soon joined the leader three or four wide to bid clear into the far turn, was joined by SCOOTER'S BOY nearing the
lane, dug in through the lane and narrowly kept that one at bay. SCOOTER'S BOY dropped off the early pace racing outside, rallied four wide in the far turn
to join the winner turning for home and went well to the end but could not get by. FOREST TREASURE saved ground in reach of the pace but could not go
with the top pair in the lane. STARRING JOHN WAIN was back off the early pace, moved four wide going to the far turn but lacked a rally. WARRIOR'S
LULLABY moved to the front through the opening turn, went with the winner to late backstretch and weakened. GEE WHIZ WHO chased the leaders three
wide and tired.

WANT TO BE COWBOY moved clear into the first turn racing about the three path, shook off a bid into the far turn to kick well clear nearing the lane and
held the margin under steady handling. KENHEDOIT was along the inside in reach of the pace then gained clear for the place while no match for the winner.
BARTENDERS MISTAKE was along the inside and moved up but lacked a solid closing bid. YE BE JUDGED chased the winner three or four wide and
weakened some in the drive. YAYASGOTMOREGAME moved up four and five wide to bid into the far turn then could not sustain the move. PETE AND
REPETE was not a threat racing three wide. QUICKLEY CAT was not a factor. REPORT TO DUTY pulled up going up the backstretch but walked off under
his own power.

BUTYOUCALLEDME angled three or four wide going to the far turn to bid and edge clear through that bend then held safe in the lane. BELLA'S BLUFF
settled back off the pace three wide, rallied through the far turn and slowly closed in the lane. LAINE'S PEACH hesitated at the break, rallied four wide to get
nearest the winner into the lane but was outfinished for position late. TICKER settled in reach of the pace outside, was five wide in the far turn and fanned
seven wide into the lane then lacked a solid closing rally. HOME EARLY SHIRLEY tracked the leaders three wide to bid into the far turn then could not
sustain the move. RUN AND TELL DAT was on the pace inside rivals to the far turn and had little left. NURSE KATIE prompted the pace three wide outside
to late backstretch and weakened. GOODNESS CAT fanned six wide out of the first turn and failed to threaten. GLORIOUS INVASOR trailed throughout.

TIGER THE MAN stalked the pace four or five wide, angled outside the drifting leader into the lane to be about seven wide then continued well and moved
clear under steady handling. FANTASTRY (BRZ) made the pace well off the rail, drifted wide into the lane and could not go with the winner. HESALITTLE
SHADY saved ground and moved up into the stretch but could not threaten. HALO JAX was squeezed back at the start, trailed early, rallied five wide in the
far turn but could not threaten. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK gained position three wide while not a threat. RUN FOR MATTY failed to mount a bid four wide.
I C WELL stalked the pace three wide and tired. HOT ARTIE tracked the leaders four wide, tucked inside entering the far turn and tired. MINCO HONEY
broke into the side of the gate, followed the pace four wide and tired. SUPER MOTION saved ground and was not a factor.
