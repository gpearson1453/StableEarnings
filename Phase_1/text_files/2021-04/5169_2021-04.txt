Footnotes
LEGIT chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch, tipped
out a path or two nearing the eighth pole for an open seam, rallied to issue a challenge inside that station getting on near even terms just inside the
sixteenth marker when brushed by RUNABOUT and got up in the last jumps to the finish to score. RUNABOUT four then three wide in pursuit, got let out
spinning four to five wide into upper stretch, took command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat brushing with his main danger just inside the
sixteenth marker and was caught in the last strides to the finish while well clear of the rest. GRIT AND GLORY prompted the leader from the outside five
then four wide before tucking to the three path at the nine-sixteenths, tucked to the two path through the turn advancing to take command five-sixteenths
from home, spun three wide into upper stretch, yielded the front at the three-sixteenths and weakened in the late stages. ROAMING UNION coaxed from
the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure through the presence of GRIT AND GLORY to the outside, tucked inside half a
mile from home, got collared at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. KING OF AMERICAN coaxed
from the start, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch before angling in to the two path into the turn, came under urging with seven-sixteenths
to run, swung four wide for home and weakened. ALLURED lunged at the start conceding three lengths to the front, chased five then four wide coaxed
along from the three-eighths, bid five wide into upper stretch and tired.

BRAZILLIONAIRE established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide under attendance to the outside by LOADED JOE, remained
patiently handled until set down spinning three then two wide into upper stretch straightened away, edged away under a drive kept busy to the end. PRINCE
OF CAPS got bumped at the start by JOHNNYPUMP and in turn bumped IRON GIANT, tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and offered up a mild kick. JOHNNYPUMP broke out a step at the start bumping PRINCE OF
CAPS into IRON GIANT, settled just off the inside early on near the rear of the field, tipped out four wide through the far turn advancing well outside of rivals
into contention swinging four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was unable to sustain the move inside the final sixteenth weakening in the
late stages while well clear for the show honors. IRON GIANT got bumped at the start and was briefly steadied getting away last, raced two to three wide
through the first turn before tipping four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the far turn placed to coaxing near the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position through to the finish. LOADED JOE forwardly placed three wide through the first
turn, attended the leader to the outside five then four wide down the backstretch and three wide through the far turn, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three then two wide into upper stretch and weakened. EPONA RISING four wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing
three furlongs from home, angled out six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. GRECIAN PHAROAH just off the pace just off the inside tracking
the front, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside for home and tired. BECKENBAUER three wide in pursuit from mid pack,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. WE READY rank just after the start under restraint, pulled on the bit
three wide into the first turn to about midway on that bend before settling just of the inside in range of the front, tucked inside into the far turn, came under
coaxing near the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

KURAMATA (IRE) settled just off the pace just off the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch, tipped out three wide through the far turn given
some rein to work with, spun three wide for home set down for the drive, came in straightened away bumping LA HARA twice, his barn and stable mate,
rallied to take command a furlong out, edged away under a light drive to prevail. LA HARA (IRE) tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled until
roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, paused straightened away when bumped twice by the aforementioned foe, got asked once more just
outside the eighth pole and kept on to secure the place honors in the final jumps. DREAMS OF TOMORROW established the front and showed the way
rated on the pace just off the inside under the watchful eyes of SINGAPORE TRADER to the outside, tucked inside three furlongs from home, took the
inside route into upper stretch let out for the drive, dug in under a drive under growing threat to the outside and was collared a furlong from home, kept on to
the finish getting nailed in the final jumps for the place honors. BOX N SCORE just off the inside through the opening bend, tipped three paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked inside at the three-eighths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and tipped out
to the three path straightened away, stayed on one paced to the finish. SO HIGH (GB) initially just off the inside past the stands for the first time, got taken
over the heels of LA HARA to tuck inside nearing the first turn forcing MANOLITO to steady off his heels in behind with six and a half furlongs to run, tracked
the pace along the rail coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SINGAPORE
TRADER coaxed from the gate, attended the leader from the outside three then two wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun thre wide for
home and weakened in the drive. FAME TO FAMOUS three wide through the first turn, raced five than four wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing
three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MANOLITO a bit rank early on under restraint along the inside, got
forced to steady six and a half furlongs out as SO HIGH tucked directly in front, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing with three
furlongs remaining, took the inside route into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
PARIS LIGHTS three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, rallied to poke a head in front a furlong
out, dug in gamely between foes to prevail on the wire. PORTAL CREEK coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, fought on inside a pair to the finish to just
preserve the place honors. HONOR WAY chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then six wide through the turn coaxed along from
the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong latching on the top pair near the sixteenth marker,
battled on outside while well clear for the show honors. KANSAS KIS chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for
home and weakened. LADY KATE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened.
