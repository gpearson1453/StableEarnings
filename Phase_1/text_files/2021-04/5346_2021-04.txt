Footnotes
TIZ WONDERFULLY well placed early behind the top pair, moved up to take control into the far turn, cleared and drew away around the bend and remained
well clear to the wire. GOTTA BE LUCKY chased the top pair from inside then moved off the rail, came three wide into the stretch and bested the rest. YOU
WANNA EAR RIP settled near the inside, moved into the two path and advanced around the far turn, angled back to the fence nearing the stretch, shifted
out and bothered MONGOLIAN WINDOW mid-stretch and held the show. MONGOLIAN WINDOW sat off the pace, traveled two wide into the stretch, was
forced out by YOU WANNA EAR RIP and steadied mid-stretch, continued willingly in the final sixteenth and missed the show. MISS YOU MOM came away
a bit slow while bobbling at the start, raced near the back of the pack, came four wide into the stretch and summoned a mild rally. ODESSA chased outside
a rival then off the rail, went three wide into the stretch and weakened. Y NOT SIZZLE trailed the field early, angled out on the first turn, went three wide into
the second bend, came out and entered the stretch five wide and passed tired foes. ZELAIA dueled for command outside BALLET ROYALTY, put away that
rival near the seven-sixteenths then lost command into the far turn, started to weaken around the bend and faded. BALLET ROYALTY dueled from inside,
lost contact into the far turn, dropped back around that bend and tired. FOLLWOING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED YOU WANNA EAR
RIP FROM THIRD TO FOURTH FOR SHIFTING AND CAUSING MONGOLIAN WINDOW TO STEADY MID-STRETCH, COSTING HER A CHANCE AT A
BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
CURVETTE up close early outside the pacesetter, drew alongside around the turn, came into the stretch on even terms, asked upper stretch and kicked
clear to win going away under strong hand urging. REEM set the pace from inside, challenged around the turn, coaxed a quarter mile out, could not keep up
with the winner in the final furlong but safely held the place. SHELL SHOCK chased off the rail then between rivals, bumped with RIVER GIRL past the
half-mile pole, went three wide around the bend and kept on while unable to threaten the top pair. SHARAPOVA came away a bit slow, pulled some and
steadied early, traveled along the inside then a bit off the rail into the stretch and weakened. RIVER GIRL chased outside a rival then three deep, bumped
with SHELL SHOCK past the half-mile marker, came three to four wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
TIZAMAGICIAN away quickly at the start, chased the pacesetter early then went up to apply pressure on the backstretch, headed rival near the
five-sixteenths, drifted out into the stretch, asked right-handed and powered away from ZESTFUL and was geared down late. ZESTFUL vied outside on the
first turn before gaining a clear lead, set the pace from inside, pressured up the backstretch, headed midway around the final bend, lost command leaving
that turn, could not kick on with the winner in the lane but stayed on to hold secure second. LURE HIM IN stalked outside a pair of rivals, went three then
four wide around the final turn and failed to produce a bid. RONAMO stalked between foes through the early stages, came two wide into the drive and never
rallied. MULTIPLIER tracked the leader inside pair of rivals, injured approaching the five-sixteenths on the last turn and was vanned off.

Footnotes
RAKASSAH (IRE) came away awkwardly but was quickly corrected, attended the pace from outside, challenged around the turn and took over a quarter
mile out, cleared inside rival leaving the bend and inched away under left-handed urging and strong handling. ANNA FANTASTIC steadied along the inside
near the half-mile pole, angled out and went two then three wide around the turn, moved out further and rallied for the place. LOFTY sped to the front and
angled to the inside, lost command at the quarter pole, chased the winner into the stretch, kept on through the final furlong and held the show. MISS LUCY
(IRE) bobbled leaving the gate, chased between foes then moved inside nearing the turn, stayed along the rail to the stretch and finished evenly. NU PI
LAMBDA angled out early, traveled two wide into the turn, swung out into the stretch and improved position. JAZZIQUE (IRE) saved ground from off the
pace and proved no menace. DEL MAR DRAMA chased three deep early, two wide and outside a rival on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
ALCOOLS stalked the speed from inside, saved ground through the turn, rallied up the fence and wore down the runner-up to get up late. I AM
ALLTHATYOUARE broke out and bumped rival at the start, vied for the lead from inside, cleared into the stretch, led through the final furlong and yielded
grudgingly to the winner. PROMISE NOTHING reserved in the early going, angled four wide around the turn, rallied outside the top pair but was not enough.
STREET BEHAVIOR sat off the pace, took the turn four wide, finished willingly in the drive but needed to find more late. BOB'S SNIPER bumped both sides
leaving the gate, vied between rivals for the lead, could not keep pace past the half-mile pole and chased the top pair between foes, remained between
rivals to the stretch and weakened. REBEL WAR broke in and bumped rival, went up to vie three deep for the lead, pressed the leader into and around the
turn, lost contact nearing the stretch and faded. GREAT POWER vied four deep early then chased three deep into and around the turn, put in tight quarters
and steadied in upper stretch and weakened after.

Footnotes
UNCLE ADDOUMA settled off the pace, advanced three then four wide around the turn, ranged up outside the leader leaving the bend, took over and
kicked clear from AURELIAN MAN and drew away. CALI BAY (IRE) off slow to begin, traveled two wide into the turn, three wide into the stretch and finished
well to gain the place. AURELIAN MAN sped clear to take control, responded when challenged around the turn, lost command in upper stretch, proved no
match inside the furlong grounds but stayed on to hold the show. MR. IMPOSSIBLE bumped repeatedly from both sides early, chased three wide around
the turn and flattened. ENOUGH NONSENSE broke in at the start, bumped repeatedly with MR. IMPOSSIBLE in the early going, put in a mild bid from
outside on the turn but failed to sustain the challenge into the drive and flattened out in the final furlong. MYOPIC broke in and bumped rival, traveled off the
pace in the two path, angled out late and could not rally. THE BOSS HARTY raced off the pace up the backstretch, took the turn two wide and weakened.
PRO BONO got bumped repeatedly in the early stages while chasing from inside, saved ground through the turn and also weakened. DESTINY ONE got
bumped at the start, saved ground into the lane and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MUCHO DEL ORO off a bit slow to begin, sent clear from inside, urged left-handed in upper stretch and widened in the furlong grounds. K P SILVER
BULLET lacked early speed, angled to the inside, came out late on the turn and into the stretch, finished well and bested the rest. BOB DANIELS chased in
the two path to the stretch and lacked a serious bid. BOLU tracked off the rail then angled in near the seven-sixteenths marker, hugged the rail into the
stretch and finished evenly to round out the superfecta. CARELESS KITTEN traveled near the back of the pack outside a rival, went between foes into the
turn, angled out around the bend, came six wide into the stretch and improved position. ROOKIE YEAR chased between foes then checked twice at and
past the nine-sixteenths, raced outside a rival on the turn, two wide into the stretch and lacked further response. STONE'S RIVER stalked off the inside,
traveled three deep into the turn, floated five wide leaving the turn and faded. BALLROOM HUSTLER chased wide up the backstretch, angled to the rail
around the turn and was never a factor. BRAVESTONE chased outside a rival, three wide around the turn and tired.

Footnotes
CEZANNE settled off the pace along the inside, closed in through the turn, took over and kicked clear in upper stretch, then powered away under
right-handed urging and steady handling. BRICKYARD RIDE sped clear to take control in the two path, entered the turn a bit off the rail, led three wide into
the stretch, failed to offer any resistance when confronted by CEZANNE and kept on to hold the place. FIGHT ON settled off the pace outside a rival or off
the rail, angled five wide into the stretch and gained the show. AX MAN was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, asked around the turn, chased four wide
into the drive and weakened.

SWEETEST ANGEL stalked from inside, lacked room and steadied late on the turn, tipped out at the top of the lane, challenged the runner-up at the
sixteenth pole and edged clear. ISN'T SHE LOVELY set the pace under pressure, cleared along the inside around the turn, led to deep stretch but got
caught at the sixteenth pole. BLEU BALLON raced off the rail, advanced three to four wide around the turn and rallied for the show. EQUILOVE (IRE)
stumbled and got bumped by inside rival, stalked off the rail or outside a rival, raced three deep at the quarter pole, asked but flattened out in the late
stages. MAJESTIC STEPS (IRE) was off the rail in mid-pack, went three wide into the lane, forced out and checked upper stretch and could not rally after.
MISS DRACARYS pressed the pace from outside, chased the leader into the lane, lost path and steadied upper stretch and weakened. ABSOLUTE
SCENES (IRE) off slow to begin, saved ground chasing the pace from inside and weakened in the drive. FRAZZLED broke out and bumped rival at the
start, steadied between rivals early, checked again near the nine-sixteenths pole, steadied off heels on the turn, angled out in the stretch and had little left.
PLUM SEXY tracked outside a rival then between into the turn, was put in tight quarters at the three-eighths pole, stayed two wide to the stretch and
weakened.
