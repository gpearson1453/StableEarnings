RUN FAST pressed the pace, outside final turn, dueled down the lane and proved the best late. COOL POWER vied for the early advantage, took command
around the second turn, dueled down the stretch with RUN FAST, couldn't match strides late, but proved best of others. GODDARD lacked early speed,
made a late bid, got up for third and proved no match for the top two. GRAND DESIGN dueled for the early advantage, saved ground and faded. SONNY
GETS BLUE broke slow, racing in the back, never mounted a bid and was eased to the wire. BALKY raced near the middle of the field, dropped back and
was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
LUCKY FLASH raced within striking distance, forwardly placed throughout, rallied down the stretch and proved the best late. MONEY INTHE STARRS
pressed the pace, raced four wide around the turn, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. NEW ORLEANS SPICE vied for the early lead,
saved ground and weakened down the stretch. PALMETTOVOWMENOT lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn, entered the stretch six wide,
improved position, but was no factor. GOLDEN BET brushed start, dueled for the early lead and faded. IRISH PRIORITY hesitated, hopped at the start,
raced in the rear and was never close. QUIET TRIP brushed at the start, raced near the back and was never a threat.

GREELEY'S DEALER stalked the leaders in the early part, moved up on the inside around the second turn, angled out leaving the turn, took command and
was going away at the end. QUEETEN challenged for the early advantage, drove clear, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of others. MAGIC
VOW raced near the middle of the field, made a late rail bid and got up for third. SOCIAL MISFIT raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout and
lacked a late kick. SINGINGINTHEWIND lacked early speed, had a wide trip, made a mild bid and finished evenly. CLASSIC GREELEY pressed the early
pace and weakened. BINDING void of early speed, finished wide and was no threat. LUCKY ANDY raced evenly near the back and showed little. EXTON
broke poorly, raced in the back and lacked a bid. FLASHY IMAGE raced within contention and made a steady retreat.

I WANT A PICTURE raced within contention throughout, took command late in the stretch and proved best. LUKE'S CAJUN STAR took the early lead but
could not hold off the winners bid. SMOOTH COLLIERY within striking distance throughout, made a bid 5 wide down the lane but could not catch the top
two. AW SHUCKS raced evenly from the inside. SIR SMACK moved to the outside down the backstretch, raced wide around the turn and was never a
serious threat. ROYAL PRIVACY hesitated at the start, breaking awkwardly and was no factor. CORRUZE showed little. PER RULING #24366 FROM THE
LOUISIANA RACING COMMISSION, I WANT A PICTURE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
