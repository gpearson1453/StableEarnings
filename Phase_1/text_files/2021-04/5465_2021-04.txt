Footnotes
POWDER RIVER trailed along the inside, patiently awaited racing room behind foes while in the two path around the turn, swung five wide entering the
lane, rallied through the final furlong, and wore down the leading duelers approaching the wire. MUCHO MACHO MOMMA tracked from midpack three wide,
steadily inched forward down the backstretch to bid for the lead outside of POP A CHOC at the three furlong pole, gamely dueled with that foe through the
lane, but was bested by an outer bidding rival late. POP A CHOC set the pace while a bit keen leaving the chute, settled before showing the way from the
bidding MUCHO MACHO MOMMA into the turn, dueled inside of that foe gamely through the lane while clinging to a narrow advantege, but was bested
late. FAVORITE SIN stalked along the inside, awaited from the pocket around the turn, but only managed to chase the leaders through the lane and failed to
produce a bid. HINDSIGHT sat back in the gates and was off a step slowly when the opened, tracked from midpack two wide, shifted three wide into the
turn, then stayed on through the final furlong, but failed to factor. TREASURE LANE lied off of the pace four wide around the turn, and was done early.
BAYSHORE FOXES lied forwardly placed two wide and from between horses, but weakened in a bit of tight quarters at the three sixteenths marker, and
was eased in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
AUSTRALASIA attended the pace inside in hand, got through entering the stretch to make a bold bid, shook clear a furlong out and held sway.
ZAINALARAB settled between rivals, steadied off of the fast retreating NO MO SPENDING nearing the seven-sixteenths marker, leveled back into stride,
rallied into the stretch, exchanged bumps with PLATINUM SKY through the lane but kept on to earn the runner up spot. PLATINUM SKY settled saving
ground, hit the rail into the turn, continued on well, swapped bumps with ZAINALARAB through the drive and settled for the minor award. GUANA CAY was
away in good order, disputed the pace off of the inside, weakened between runners late and gave way. BIG TIME vied for the lead three wide, contested the
issue to the final furlong and flattened. AMALFI PRINCESS was allowed to settle, ranged up to make a mild bid between foes leaving the turn but failed to
sustain the drive. ROOKERY was unhurried, moved up through the turn, angled out five wide but lacked the needed response. HATMAKER HOLIDAY came
away a bit slow and was never a factor. NO MO' SPENDING contested the pace between, broke stride into the turn, quickly dropped back through the field
and trailed thereafter.

Footnotes
ILLIOGAMI rated off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the three path before swinging five wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes
through midstretch, and drove past the leader inside the final sixteenth. TABOR HALL pressed the pace two wide, vied between horses while managing a
minor margin around the far turn, gamely fended off those rivals and other bidding foes through midstretch, but surpassed by an outer rallying rival
approaching the wire. MINUTE WALTZ stalked three wide, bid for the lead between horses approaching the five sixteenths pole, sustained the duel through
midstretch, but was outkicked by ILLIOGAMI approaching the final sixteenth. TAKE CHARGE LORIN set the pace along the inside, vied inside of a trio of
rivals around the far turn after being headed, dug in in upper stretch and sustained the duel into the final furlong, but yielded through the final sixteenth.
MALLOY stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail turning for home, and chased from behind the leading group through the lane. ANOTHER WOMAN
tracked from midpack four wide around the first turn, inched closer into the far turn to press the pace around that bend, sustained vying position through
upper stretch, but tired between horses passing the furlong pole. AMERICAN WEST tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted two wide down the
backstretch, chased the leading quartet from the five path around the far turn, then weakened entering the lane. BOW BOW GIRL trailed, took the far turn
three wide, and never got involved. POLKA POLENTA lied off of the pace two wide, but weakened into the far turn, was done early, then eased through the
final furlong, and jogged across the wire before walking off.

Footnotes
MAXFIELD settled in hand, ranged up three deep to engage the leaders midway through the second turn, struck the front entering the stretch, edged clear
under steady urging nearing the furlong marker, was kept to task and held. VISITANT set the pressured pace along the inside, relinquished the lead once
straightened for the drive, was unable to go on with the winner but fought on to preserve the place spot. CHESS CHIEF was unhurried into stride, wheeled
out five wide into the stretch and improved position. ROADSTER tracked in hand outside VISITANT, came to level terms on the second turn, but faltered
between rivals in the upper stretch and gave way. SONNEMAN settled saving ground, drifted out into the lane but lacked a response when called upon.
ATTACHMENT RATE was never a factor.

Footnotes
GIFT LIST (GB) stalked comfortably along the inside, tracked from behind the leading pair while in the two path around the far turn, shifted outside of the
leader entering the lane while being floated to the four path by that foe, but blew past that rival at the three sixteenths pole, and widened to the wire under
steady, but mild, pressure. BARISTA tracked from midpack while in the two to three paths around the turns, swung to the six path turning for home, and
rallied through the lane, but failed to threaten the leader while well clear of show on the wire. LINE DANCING lied off of the pace two wide, swung to the
seven path turning for home, and stayed on with a mild kick to reach show on the wire. QUEEN OF THE GREEN trailed along the inside, saved ground
rating off of the pace around both turns, then sustained a mild rail rally through the lane to vie for show in the final sixteenth, but was outfinished by an outer
foe for that position. AUNT PEARL (IRE) set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pressing ZAAJEL around the far turn while a path off of the
inner railing, shifted to the three path entering the lane while meeting GIFT LIST (GB)'s bid, but offered little resistance to that foe at the three sixteenths
pole, quickly proved no match while fading passing that marker, and further weakened between horses at the furlong pole. POSTNUP saved ground off of
the pace, shifted two wide turning for home, but failed to make an impact. ZAAJEL prompted the pace setter form the outside, got kept in the three path by
that rival around the far turn, but faded while being floated to the five path turning for home.

Footnotes
OBLIGATORY was unhurried into stride, circled seven wide into the stretch, reeled in the leader and edged clear late. DAYOUTOFTHEOFFICE shadowed
the leaders three deep, made a bold bid and took over nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened clear into the lane, continued on fairly well but was unable to
resist the winner. MAKE MISCHIEF saved ground off of the pace, slipped through a narrow rail opening in midstretch with a clear DAYOUTOFTHEOFFICE
to catch, but was outkicked by an outer foe inside the final furlong before threatening, and was best of the rest. SOUPER SENSATIONAL stalked
comfortably along the inside, but was blocked behind traffic in upper stretch, awaited racing room to midstrech before splitting foes three wide at the furlong
pole, but was brushed by an inner rallying rival a sixteenth out. ABROGATE contended between horses, split rivals and loomed a danger entering the
stretch, but flattened in the final furlong. LI'L TOOTSIE was allowed to settle, took closer order through the turn, came six wide but weakened. CARAMEL
SWIRL broke outwardly and was slow into stride, made a steady advance through the turn to range into striking distance, but failed to sustain the drive.
SLUMBER PARTY lied off of the pace two wide and from between horses into the turn, but failed to keep pace with her surrounding counterparts at the
three furlong pole, lost ground turning for home, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, and lacked a rerally. CANTATA shifted three wide down the
backstretch while off of the pace, held that path around the turn before shifting to the five path entering the lane, where she met traffic, but was empty once
clear. EUPHORIC was hustled out of the gate to set the pace, showed the way along the inside from a pair of pressing rivals into the turn, but was headed
by her outermost foe at the five sixteenths pole before proving no match for that rival entering the lane, then further weakened between horses at the furlong
grounds. WINDMILL pressed the pace two wide, then from between horses around the turn as DAYOUTOFTHEOFFICE ranged up alongside, but quickly
proved no match for that foe turning for home, and weakened in upper stretch. KALYPSO was allowed to settle, stopped after a half, was eased to the wire
and walked off, bled.

Footnotes
FAST BOAT rated far off of the pace along the inside, swung five wide turning for home, rallied outside of SOMBEYAY to bid for the lead passing the furlong
pole along with that rival, bumped with that foe in the process before dueling with him through the final furlong, and prevailed. SOMBEYAY advanced three
wide and outside of rivals from far off of the pace down the backstretch, shifted four wide entering the lane, sustained his charge through upper stretch to bid
for the lead between horses at the furlong pole, but was jostled between those rivals passing that marker, continued the duel thereafter, but was bested by
his outer foe in the final sixteenth. CLASSY JOHN stalked along the inside, shifted three wide in upper stretch, rallied to produce a bid approaching the
furlong pole as a pair of outer foes did the same, drifted out and bumped a rival passing that marker, shifted back inwards in the aftermath, and got
outkicked. DIAMOND OOPS lied off of the pace two wide, but steadied in a bit of tight quarters approaching the five sixteenths pole, shifted inside of rivals
in upper stretch, and sustained a rail gain for a minor share. CAROTARI tracked from midpack in the three path, got briefly blocked in tight quarters in upper
stretch, but sustained an advance through traffic before being herded outwards at the furlong pole, and stayed on late. JOHNNY UNLEASHED saved
ground from midpack, chased from behind the leading group in upper stretch, came outwards passing the furlong pole, but failed to challenge between
horses late. SMART REMARK was allowed to settle, circled into the stretch five wide and improved position. JUST MIGHT disputed the pace to the outside
of FLYA to the final furlong and succumbed. GUILDSMAN (FR) was slow into stride, settled along the hedge, shifted out in upper stretch and passed some
tiring ones. AMBASSADOR LUNA was allowed to settle three deep, came four wide into the stretch, but came up empty entering the stretch and faded.
FIYA contested the pace along the shrub to the furlong marker and faded fast, then was vanned off.

Footnotes
MINTD (IRE) settled saving ground, shifted out and advanced between horses through the second turn, continued to work through traffic into the stretch,
angled back to the inside nearing the furlong marker, got through and kicked away. SARA SEA set the pace along the inside, fought on well through a long
drive but was unable to resist the winner. MORE THAN UNUSUAL settled in hand, ranged up four wide to make a bold bid, churned on fairly well but settled
for the minor award. ALNASEEM (GB) settled four wide, jumped debris near the seven-sixteenths pole, leveled quickly back into stride, was fanned out six
wide entering the stretch and was making up ground. ABBY HATCHER (IRE) settled off of the inside, advanced between rivals, angled in nearing the
furlong marker but lacked the needed response. MISS MOSAIC stalked the pace three wide, came four wide to make her bid, but failed to sustain the drive.
COLOR ME PRETTY lunged at the start, was away behind her field and was never a factor. TIZAHRA failed to make headway. CHOATE BRIDGE saved
ground to no avail. TEENAGE KICKS was never a factor. WOKE UP TO ACES chased three wide to the second turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
PORTILLA rallied from far off of the pace four wide around the turn, sustained her charge under a long drive, and reeled in the clear leader on the wire.
PLAYED HARD set the pace two wide, cleared after a quarter mile, met a pair of bids entering the lane, dug in gamely thereafter, but was nailed. SMITH'S
POINT was slow into stride and lagged well behind the field early on, picked up stride and cut the gap on the turn in the four path, shifted six wide turning for
home, and rallied for show. LONELY JUNE lied off of the pace two wide, and stayed on betweeen horses for a minor share. LIBERTY ISLE brushed the
gate at the start, tracked from midpack inside, shifted three wide into the turn, then five wide into the lane, but tired. ONLY KIDDING stalked two wide, bid
entering the lane, but yielded between horses in midstretch. JIM'S BRONZE STAR broke well but failed to keep pace among rivals through the opening
furlong, steadied back when put to tight quarters at the half mile pole, and failed to menace thereafter. MAGIC QUEST exchanged bumps with an outer rival
at the start, lied close up along the inside, chased into the turn, and faded thereafter. BIZZY ECHO exchanged bumps with an inner rival at the start, lied off
of the pace along the inside, and failed to factor.
