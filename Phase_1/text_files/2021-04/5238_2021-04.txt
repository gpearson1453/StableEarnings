Footnotes
GUNMAN bobbled slightly at the start to no ill effect, quickly sprinted clear, rated along inside to the stretch and was kept tp pressure to remain well in
command. MASTER Q steadied slightly behind GUNMAN approaching the turn, remained inside to the lane and finished willingly while not a serious threat.
NAVY PIER absorbed a solid bump from COTTON JIM at the start, chased three wide to the stretch, and gained only mildly. COTTON JIM broke outward
into NAVY PIER, pursued the winner from outside for three furlongs, and tired. CHAPPY'S BREEZE lunged awkwardly at the break spotting the field several
lengths, and never recovered.

LADY FIORELLA stalked the pace two wide, took over near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead. WITCH HUNTER set a clear pace along the rail, angled
out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead, was collared near the sixteenth pole, fought on inside of the winner but was outfinished. ETANA head her
head turned at the start, lagged well behind the field in the two path, swung widest in upper stretch and was along late for the show. SHE TAKES HEART
was up close inside and lacked a closing bid. GRACE'S DRAMA tracked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. LOVE DADDY played no
factor while racing four wide.

Footnotes
SHIKAKA took the lead with an alert break and went clear, responded to discourage a challenge from WHAT'S THE MOVE after a half-mile, moved away
again around the far turn, and was kept to pressure to the finish. LADY CLOVERLY hopped at the start and was off slowly, raced three wide around the
turns within range, and kept on with good courage to best the remainder on the far outside. WHAT'S THE MOVE prompted the pace, lodged a mild bid
between horses after a half, could not match strides with SHIKAKA through the far turn, and ran on to salvage the show. AUBURN hit the right side of the
gate to get away slowest, went to the first turn tough to handle under a firm grasp, and was empty when roused. ROONEY saved ground and failed to
factor.

MUDSLIDE WICKED was up close inside, started to come through inside of the pacesetter midway around the turn, steadied nearing the five-sixteenths
pole, angled out nearing the quarter pole, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. DRIVING WIND set the pace in the two path, dug in inside of the
winner through the final furlong and gave way grudgingly. MAMA LONGLEGS hopped at the start, saved ground off the pace and ran on for the show. AIR
CAVALRY failed to menace while racing two wide. BAD PAY prompted the pace three wide and faded in the lane. COCOTARA hit the starting gate,
advanced four wide around the turn and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
GREYZER prompted the early pace, bid between horses on the turn, bumped lightly with CONVERTER at the top of the stretch, and edged away through
the last eighth of a mile. SHANANIES PAYNTER saved ground in striking range to the turn, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and rallied on the
far outside to get up for second. CONVERTER set the pace inside, bumped lightly with GREYZER while yielding to that rival three-sixteenths out, and was
overtaken for the place late. SIDARTH pressed the pace three wide, and faded turning for home. SAMARONTI bobbled slightly at the start, and was no
factor three wide. JACOHARE was finished early three to four wide. CRAZY SHOT was finished early inside. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY
THE RIDER OF CONVERTER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
TELLINGTON raced off the early pace three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, closed determinedly outside through the lane and was up in the
final strides. LONG BEACH KID stalked the pace two wide, bid nearing the lane, vied outside of GO MIKE through the stretch, briefly led in deep stretch but
was unable to hold off the winner. GO MIKE set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of foes in the lane and led until the final strides. LOAD UP MOE raced
well back inside early, advanced three wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly. HACHACHA chased the pace two wide early, remained in range inside
around the far turn and lacked a rally. UNCLE PIP saved ground off the pace, checked midway around the first turn, moved up a bit inside around the far
turn, angled out in upper stretch, never threatened then steadied off heels in deep stretch. OUR STUIE broke awkwardly but quickly, saved ground around
the turns and played no factor. EXXTOP chased the pace three wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
LAUDA SPEED dueled outside REAL TALK from the outset, reached the front five-sixteenths out, gained the upper hand edging away past the eighth-pole
under a drive, then swerved out and in while safely clear about 70 yards from the finish. REAL TALK set the pace hounded by LAUDA SPEED through the
opening half-mile, could not match strides through upper stretch, moved off the inside with a sixteenth to go and ran on clearly second best. BOCA BOY
eyed the battling leaders in the clear three wide, but made no headway through the lane. KING CAIRO moved inside early, saved ground the rest of the way
and lacked a closing response. OCEAN RIDE broke two lengths slow, struggled to keep pace while shifting out four wide on the turn, and continued to fade.
SUPER STRONG was finished early three wide.

Footnotes
SERENADE A KITTEN saved ground in easy striking range on the turns, bid along the rail into the stretch, bumped with SARA MIA near the eighth-pole,
swerved out sharply late under left-hand pressure and held for the decision. SMART SPENDING bumped with LULLULA at the start, settled in midpack near
the two-path, lacked room behind SARA MIA in upper stretch, moved out for clearance swapping back to her left lead into the final furlong, and was getting
to the winner too late. KATE'S KINGDOM raced four to five wide early, put in a challenge in the four-path outside rivals approaching the stretch, and was
outfinished between the top two. ITALIAN TWIN bobbled at the start, saved ground early, came three wide off the far turn, shifted further out and gained
gradually through the closing stages. LULLULA got bumped by BIG RINGS at the break and came away slowest, lagged well back to the far turn while
moving out three wide, went back inside for the drive and improved without threatening. SARA MIA tugged her way along on the early lead, faced
challengers from both flanks turning for home, bumped with SERENADE A KITTEN while on rubbery legs coming to the furlong grounds, then took up
sharply behind the latter while weakening late. GLITTER BAY pursued the pacesetter to the far turn, bid between horses in the three-path at the top of the
lane, but faltered once straightened away. SHANG'S SISTER raced four to five wide throughout, and tired in the stretch. DEM A WONDER stayed in range
three to four wide to midway on the far turn, and gave way. BIG RINGS broke out knocking LULLULA into SMART SPENDING, went around the first turn in
the six-path, and faded steadily.
