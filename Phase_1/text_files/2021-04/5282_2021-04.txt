SAINTSGOTROBBED went to the front, led throughout, pulled away and was in hand late. SABER RUN was an early factor, forwardly placed throughout,
proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. MIDNIGHT SPIRIT pressed the pace, raced close throughout and proved no match for the top two.
LOUISIANA HERO raced in the middle of the field, came around the final turn wide, made a mild bid and was outfinished for third. REAL BRAVE lacked
early speed, raced wide around the first turn and passed tired ones late. HEATHER'S REQUEST raced near the middle of the pack and put forth an even
effort. WILD FIREMAKER raced within striking distance, saved ground around the final turn and faded. BROOK IS GOLDEN hesitated at the start, raced in
the back and was never a threat. GOTTATAKEHIMTO void of early speed and was outrun.

TWO DOT raced within contention, was close throughout and proved the best late. MAINTAINANCE MATT raced near the back in the beginning, moved up
on the outside around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. LION HEART LEGEND sprinted to the front, drove clear and lacked
a late kick. ALTERANA raced near the back, made a mild bid, finished wide and was no factor. TACTICAL PRIORITY pressed the early pace and faded.
KING COOKIE raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn and faded. MAY HOUR void of early speed, came around the turn wide and was
no threat. DIXIE STREET always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
STUART HALL lacked early speed, moved up on the inside around the final turn, split rivals down the lane and proved the best late. EBRIO bobbled at the
start, went to the front, drove clear, but was no match late for the winner. NETELA raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, finished wide and
was a clear third. MR. BANDINI'S BAND raced near the back in the beginning, saved ground around the final turn, made a bid and hung. LOOKING FOR
BULL raced near the back, came around the second turn four wide, put forth an even effort and was never a factor. TASTE FOR TALENT dueled for the
early lead and faded down the home stretch. QUALITY PRODUCTION raced in the middle of the pack, came around the second turn three wide and was
finished early. LITTLE WISE GUY always raced near the back and showed little. RED WINED UP raced within contention and dropped back.
