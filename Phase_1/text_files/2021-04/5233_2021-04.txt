BEACH GETAWAY stalked the early pace, went four wide into the second turn, angled in, took control at the eighth pole and edged clear. BONNET was up
close early, raced six wide into the second turn, was eased back, re-rallied and finished second best. SENORADIABLO was allowed to settle early,
advanced three wide into the second turn and offered some late gain. SEMI SWEET broke out at the start, was void of any early speed, saved ground into
the home turn and finished evenly late. RED VENUS tracked the early pace, raced seven wide into the second turn and offered no late rally. ORNAMENTAL
IRON set a clear early pace, raced five wide into both turns and faded.
