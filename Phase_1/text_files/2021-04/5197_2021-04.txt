Footnotes
WILDWOOD MAGGIE broke outward, chased three wide through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, bid four wide into the far turn, led near the
three eighths, lost the lead as STOLEN GLANCE fought on inside her into the lane. continued to vie with that one under a drive, kept on gamely despite
drifting in and out late, and finally wore STOLEN GLANCE down. STOLEN GLANCE set the pace inside, took pressure from HOLD THE SPENDING
through the first turn, cleared past the eleven sixteenths, was confronted again into the second turn and headed by WILDWOOD MAGGIE near the three
eighths, came back inside her near the quarter, kept on gamely under a drive in the lane but was worn down late. BIG LUCK chased inside of I SAW HER
FIRST through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, tracked behind the leading line in the two to three path on the turn, swung six wide into upper
stretch, was carried out further as I SAW HER FIRST drifted out while fading, rallied under a drive, found her best at the sixteenth pole, and missed.
SPECIAL CONQUEST settled at the rear of a compact field, chased in the three path on the far turn, improved under a drive in the two path in upper
stretch, but flattened out in the final furlong. I SAW HER FIRST was reluctant to load and fractious in the gate, chased between horses through the far turn,
continued a bit keenly between horses into the backstretch, encroached outside of STOLEN GLANCE past the half mile mark, attended the pace between
horses until beginning to weaken past the three eighths, and drifted out in upper stretch while weakening. HOLD THE SPENDING prompted two wide
through the clubhouse turn, tracked behind the leader past the eleven sixteenths, bid three wide between horses into the far turn, but could not keep pace
with the rest of the leading line from the three eighths and steadily weakened. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION AN INCORRECT QUARTER TIME WAS
POSTED ON THE TELEVISION. THE CORRECT QUARTER TIME IS 24.59. PER RULING #211005 FROM THE ILLINOIS RACING COMMISSION,
WILDWOOD MAGGIE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
HER GOLD MINE raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch well off the pace, launched an outside bid nearing the three
eighths pole, entered the stretch in the two path, dueled between horses in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final furlong. KURINGAI trailed the field from
the two path through the opening half mile, raced in the three path around the far turn, began a bid entering the stretch and gained ground steadily on the
outside down the lane. WOOD NOT MIND was reluctant to load, saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch,
continued to save ground around the far turn and gained ground between horses in late stretch. SATIATE brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the
gate, recovered to lead the field into the first turn, raced on the rail up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the far turn
and weakened in the final furlong. VEGAN GOES BEST brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in tight quarters entering the first turn
and angled out to find room, chased the leader up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path, was outkicked in upper stretch and came on
again with a mild late run in deep stretch. CHOLLA bobbled slightly leaving the gate, was forced out mildly entering the first turn when VEGAN GOES BEST
came into her path, raced in the three path from there, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack under a hold, began a bid with half a mile to
go, saved ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
PAYTIENCE PAYS stalked three wide down the backstretch, pressed outside of LUSCIOUS while that leading pair drew well clear of the rest of the field,
went to a drive past the quarter while looming outside the leader, vied outside the pacesetter from midstretch to the sixteenth, and drove clear late.
LUSCIOUS was sent for pace between horses, led from the five eighths between horses, continued to set a pressured pace in the two path on the turn while
racing inside of PAYTIENCE PAYS, went to a drive past the three sixteenths, vied inside of PAYTIENCE PAYS from midstretch to the sixteenth, and proved
no match late. COLOROFACLOUD chased two wide toward the rear early, was pushed along vigorously three wide on the turn and began to improve,
sustained her outside rally when driven in the lane and missed the place. BIRD KEY settled at the rear, trailed in the three to four path on the turn, swung
out six wide in upper stretch, and responded with a mild outside rally under a drive. WINNINGISFUN came away a bit awkwardly, chased toward the rear
inside of COLOROFACLOUD early, continued near the rear in the two path on the turn, was driven inside into the lane, but lacked the necessary kick.
CARMEN O'ELECTRA grazed the gate while breaking inwards, tracked in the pocket behind the leading trio early, chased in the three path on the turn well
behind the leading pair, came up empty at the quarter pole and faded. NO LETTIN GO was sent for speed, began to drop back from the leading flight near
the nine sixteenths, faded inside on the turn and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
CHINOBE led the field on the inside up the backstretch and into the turn, fought his rider while drifting very wide around the turn, was pulled back into save
ground for the second half of the bend and kicked clear entering the stretch, much the best. WAVE'NDUMONI raced well off the pace up the backstretch,
saved ground the turn, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and gained ground on the outside in late stretch. TOUSSAINT settled in in the middle of the
pack for the run up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and improved position between horses in the
final furlong. REDNECKERTHANYOU settled in just behind the leaders on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the turn from the two path,
was outkicked in the stretch but finished evenly. POQUITO MAN pressed the pace on the outside, entered the turn in the two path, was carried out to the
seven path when CHINOBE drifted out on the turn, angled back in for the remainder of the turn and then tired in the stretch. EL LAY broke slowly and was
pinched back leaving the gate, trailed far behind the field up the backstretch and around the turn, raced in the two path around the turn and passed tiring
horses in the stretch while never threatening. YOUJUSTGOTTUPPERED raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, came
around the turn in the two path and made no bid. ABOVE NIKE stalked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, raced into traffic and was forced to
steady headed into the turn, saved ground from there and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
DEANO tracked behind the dueling pair inside of JAGUAR RIDGE down the backstretch, continued in range behind that duo into the turn, tipped three wide
past the five sixteenths to make his bid, took over from the three sixteenths and cleared under a mild drive. MR. LUV MAKER was slightly awkward into
stride, settled at the inside of the rear group, began to improve while pushed along inside on the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, never threatened
the winner but kept on willingly to prove a clear second best. MINISTER'S GLORY raced between horses in the rear group early, took closer order two wide
between horses on the turn, dropped inside and went to a drive in upper stretch, kept on mildly, and passed a weakening pacesetter late for the show. HIGH
HERO was bumped by JAGUAR RIDGE in the opening strides and then bumped into LEFT COAST DREAMS as a result, dueled for the lead outside of
SERIOUS TALK down the backstretch, set the pace while hounded by that foe around the turn, was confronted by DEANO to his outside in upper stretch,
proved no match from the three sixteenths, flattened out and lost the show late. YOUNG CORBETT chased midpack down the backstretch and four wide on
the turn, swung five wide into the lane, went to a drive but lacked the needed kick. SERIOUS TALK dueled inside of HIGH HERO down the backstretch,
continued to hound inside of that foe on the turn, was driven at the inside of the leading flight in upper stretch, proved no match for DEANO from the three
sixteenths and emptied out inside. LEFT COAST DREAMS was bumped by HIGH HERO in the opening strides as part of the chain reaction caused by
JAGUAR RIDGE breaking inward, raced three wide in the rear group early, trailed in the four path on the turn, was driven five wide in upper stretch and
mustered no rally. JAGUAR RIDGE broke inward, bumped HIGH HERO in the opening strides, tracked the speed duel early outside of DEANO down the
backstretch, flattened out three wide on the turn, had no response under a drive in upper stretch and continued to fade.

Footnotes
HALO HUNTER led narrowly under a hold early, vied inside of ENZOEXPRESS on the turn while racing in the two path, floated out into the lane in the four
path, was hand ridden near the three sixteenths to shake off his pursuers, spurted further clear when shown the crop and hit once near the sixteenth pole,
and was wrapped up in the final strides. MEXICO MEMORIES tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was pushed
along past the three eighths, dropped to the inside past the quarter pole and loomed inside of HALO HUNTER near the three sixteenths, altered off the
inside and was driven near the furlong mark, proved no match for the winner but kept on to hold the place. AMERICAN HERITAGE settled near the rear
down the backstretch, was urged past the three eighths while racing in the three to four path, swung out into the seven path in upper stretch and went to a
drive, rallied mildly but could not get to MEXICO MEMORIES for place. MIAS MOONBEAM was bumped by ENZOEXPRESS in the opening strides, settled
at the rear, trailed in the five path on the turn, raced into the lane in the seven path and was driven, and kept on evenly. ENZOEXPRESS broke out and
bumped MIAS MOONBEAM in the opening strides, attended the pace outside of HALO HUNTER down the backstretch, vied with that foe while racing in the
four path around the bend, floated into the stretch in the six path while going to a drive, failed to keep pace with HALO HUNTER from the top of the stretch
and weakened.

Footnotes
HUEY ATTACK dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and continued to draw off down
the lane, much the best. JEFF THE LION raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, came around the turn in the two path, began a bid nearing the
three sixteenths pole, angled out to find racing room and gained ground on the outside to the wire. D' YANK raced at the back of the pack on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole, found himself in tight quarters at the top of
the stretch, found room on the rail and improved position inside from there. BABA LOU chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two
path around the turn and finished evenly. GIVIN UP NONE bumped extensively with the horses to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to stalk the
frontrunners between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, moved up entering the stretch and was outkicked from there. DEMAND
RANSOM dueled for the lead between horses up the backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch in the two path and weakened in the final furlong.
VERRAZANOINTHESKY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, came around the turn in the three path, entered the stretch in striking position
and flattened out. LASTFORTINOFAMILY raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, navigated the turn between the three and four
paths, swung wider still entering the stretch and passed tiring horses late. INDIAN SIGN bumped significantly with the horses to either side of him at the
break, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was not a factor. MISTER CHARMING was bumped
and squeezed back at the break, stumbled badly twice a few strides out of the gate, recovered to trail the field on the inside up what remained of the
backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and could not overcome his trouble at the start to threaten. JUST RUN raced off the pace on the outside
through the opening half mile, came around the turn in the four and five path, continued to race wide entering the stretch and was empty from there.
DECEITFUL ANTHONY dueled for the lead on the outside through the opening half mile, raced in the three path around the turn and tired entering the
stretch. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE INCIDENT JUST AFTER THE START. UPON REVIEW NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE
ORDER OF FINISH.
