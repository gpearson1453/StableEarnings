Footnotes
APOLLO U ANYWHERE bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, dueled in upper
stretch, gamely turned back that rival and pulled clear again in the final furlong. LADY ATLANTIC brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate,
raced in tight quarters early, eventually settled in off the pace on the outside, stayed wide around the turn, began a bid from the four path approaching the
quarter pole and gained ground quickly on the outside in late stretch. REND LAKE BABY brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, chased the
frontrunner between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, moved up to challenge nearing the five sixteenths pole, dueled in
upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. OZETTE settled in in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, steadied slightly near the eighth pole when MINGO MAGIC veered in, and made no bid. MINGO MAGIC veered out leaving the gate, was
guided back in to chase the leader on the outside, raced in the three path around the turn, began to tire in upper stretch, drifted in sharply near the eighth
pole and continued to fade from there. TEMRIK was fractious in the gate, hit it at the break, trailed well behind the field up the backstretch, came around the
turn in the two path and was never a factor. THIS RACE WAS TIMED BY HAND.

Footnotes
TO THE BANK bobbled inward in the opening strides and bumped ZARMAE, set a pressured pace inside, shook clear when driven into the lane, and stayed
on while kept to the task. ROCKET RIDE broke inward and bumped ZARMAE in the opening strides, tracked behind the leading line through the clubhouse
turn, continued to track the leading pair as CHARLIE'S HEIR faded past the eleven sixteenths, bid to engage the leading flight three wide on the far turn,
could not match TO THE BANK when driven in upper stretch, but kept on willingly to prove a clear second best. OFF TO THE BEACH prompted the early
pace between horses, continued to press the leader two wide down the backstretch, attended between horses again when ROCKET RIDE joined three wide
past the three eighths, proved no match for TO THE BANK or ROCKET RIDE from the quarter, but chased on well enough under a drive to salvage the
show. JOHNNY LONGBOAT broke slowly, settled well behind the main group, was pushed along into the far turn, saved ground while taking closer order,
angled five wide in upper stretch, chased on under a drive, but lacked the needed kick. ZARMAE was bumped between horses early, chased the leading
foursome through the first turn, continued to chase the leading trio down the backstretch and in the two path on the far turn, went to a drive near the three
eighths, and emptied out inside down the lane. CHARLIE'S HEIR came off a bit slowly, prompted the pace three wide through the first turn and into the
backstretch, began to fade near the eleven sixteenths, continued to back up in the five path on the far turn and was not persisted with late.

no match for the leader but kept on willingly and held the place. ANDREAS settled at the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, was taken five wide into
upper stretch and driven, found his best approaching the sixteenth mark, rallied and missed the place. POWER CRY was hustled for early speed, set the
pace in the two to three path on the turn, was engaged by STORMY PACIFIC to his outside near the five sixteenths, vied inside him to the head of the
stretch, proved no match past the quarter, and flattened out inside. COME ON DOVER tracked the leader outside of STORMY PACIFIC down the
backstretch, tracked the leading pair in the four path on the turn, chased four wide in upper stretch, drifted out, and weakened in the final furlong. MAGI
chased outside of GO FOR SHERRIE down the backstretch and in the five path on the turn, was driven six wide in upper stretch but lacked a rally.

CHARLO sprinted clear to the early lead, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, swung slightly wide entering the stretch and held
off the closers in late stretch. RONAN raced at the back of the pack in the early going, came around the turn in the two and three paths, began a bold move
passing the quarter pole and gained ground quickly on the outside from there. WAR COLORS raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, came
around the turn in the two path and improved position between horses in the final furlong. NURSE SADIE trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, angled out in the stretch to find racing room and passed tiring horses down the lane. HEART OF REASON chased the leader between
horses through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn and weakened on the rail in the final furlong. ABBMAR chased the
frontrunner on the outside in the opening stages, came around the turn between the three and four paths and faded in late stretch. FULL OF HEART raced
off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. SHEZ A BULLY stumbled leaving the gate, was hustled along to chase the
leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began to drop back coming off the turn, swerved mildly in upper stretch and
continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
BAROQUE tracked the leader through the clubhouse turn, advanced to prompt the pace between horses down the backstretch, tracked the leader in the
two to three path on the far turn, was driven behind the leader in upper stretch and taken out to the four to five path, improved gamely between horses into
the final furlong, was put in tight as RAYO DE LUZ drifted but still fought past that foe for the win. RAYO DE LUZ was sent for speed, raced keenly into the
backstretch, set a pressured pace down the backstretch, cleared in the two path on the turn, went to a drive past the quarter pole, kept on when confronted
by BAROQUE into the final furlong, kept on under a drive while drifting out but narrowly failed to hold BAROQUE at bay. ANTRIM'S GIANT chased outside
of LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS in the rear flight while keen, raced between horses in the three to four path on the far turn while in the rear group, was driven in
the six path in upper stretch, loomed outside the leading pair midstretch, but proved no match for the leading pair in the final sixteenth.
LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS settled at the rear of a compact field early, inched forward to track behind the leading line down the backstretch, tracked in the
pocket around the far turn, was driven in range inside into the lane, but weakened in the two path past midstretch. SERTOMAN was keen in range through
the first turn, tracked the pace three wide down the backstretch, began to weaken past the half mile pole, flattened in the five path around the far turn and
had nothing further in the lane.

LOST IN MANHATTAN chased the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, and gained ground steadily on the
outside to wear down the leader late. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER led the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, dug in gamely in upper
stretch and was caught late, the best of the rest. FOLLOW THE SIGNS raced at the back of the pack early, came around the turn alternating between the
three and the four path, improved position mildly in the stretch but was no match for the top two. RIP IT RYAN broke slowly, trailed the field up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and came up empty in the stretch. SOVIET raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile,

Footnotes
ZANFORCE set the pace inside while hounded by HINTON to his outside throughout while racing well clear of the rest of the field, went to a drive past the
quarter pole, continued to clear the rest of the field in tandem with HINTON, and always maintained a narrow lead. HINTON prompted the pace outside of
ZANFORCE while clear of the rest of the field, went to a drive in upper stretch, separated even further from the rest of the field but could not wrest the lead.
FORGOT TO FORGET chased inside through the clubhouse turn, continued well behind the leading trio down the backstretch and in the two path on the far
turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, responded with an outside rally when put to a drive, and proved best of the rest. SATURDAYS HANGOVER
bobbled out of the gate and bumped with TIMINGISEVERYTHING, settled at the rear into the first turn, chased in second last among a well-strung field
down the backstretch, continued toward the rear in the three path around the far turn, angled four wide in upper stretch, and passed tiring horses under a
drive while gradually drifting out. MAXIMUS IMAGE chased toward the rear of midpack in a strung-out field, inched forward from near the five eighths,
chased the leading pair while racing in the two path on the far turn, could not keep pace with the leading pair into the lane, and flattened out. DAVKA floated
wide into the first turn, dropped in to track well off the leading pair through the bend and down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the far turn while
losing ground on the leaders, was driven three wide in upper stretch but continued to gradually weaken. TIMINGISEVERYTHING bumped with
SATURDAYS HANGOVER in the opening strides, settled toward the rear, continued near the back of the field in the two to three path on the far turn, was
driven in the four path in upper stretch, and mustered no rally. CHARLIE IRISH chased two wide through the first turn, continued midpack down the
backstretch, began to weaken in the two path on the far turn, offered no response when swung out and driven in the five path in upper stretch, and
continued to fade. TOCCETIVE JAC bobbled out of the gate, settled outside of SATURDAYS HANGOVER in the rear pair through the first turn, trailed down
the backstretch and through the far turn, came into the lane in the two path, and offered no bid. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION AN INCORRECT TIME
WAS PUBLISHED ON THE TELEVISION FEED. THE CORRECT FINISH TIME IS 1:44.25.
