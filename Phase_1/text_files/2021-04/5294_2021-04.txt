TIZ PROMISING RVF stayed out from the inside while unhurried, swung out entering the stretch, took over inside the final sixteenth and edged clear under
urging. STEADY ROCK raced well out into the track while unhurried early then finished gamely outside. SACRED SHO GRL ducked out sharply leaving the
gate, moved to a short lead from the outside before going a quarter, ran clear into the stretch then gave way. DIAMOND MOON broke sharply for the early
advantage, stayed out from the rail while with the pace to the stretch then tired. STRAW HAT lagged early and failed to menace. DATA DOLL raced
between rivals on the pace to the turn then faded.

Footnotes
BOYS OF QUEENS broke slowly, stayed out from the inside while unhurried, angled to the outside in early stretch while rallying and was up in time. BLOW
THE WHISTLE steadied while unhurried shortly after the break, came out four wide nearing the stretch while rallying, moved to a short lead in late stretch
but couldn't last. SENSATIONAL ZIP moved to a clear entering the first turn, stayed close to the inside while making the pace for over a mile then faltered.
SOLAR WARMING settled, made a run three wide between horses into the stretch but lacked a strong closing response. PATTY'S BOY steadied soon after
the break, lagged inside early, made a run into the stretch and gained mildly through the lane. THE BEST CANDY steadied shortly after the break, stayed
inside, moved closer into the stretch then lacked a further response. FED FEVER chased the early leader for about six furlongs then stopped.

Footnotes
MEROCKETMAN showed speed, moved three wide to command into the turn, edged clear and held under urging. TOMMY'S TOP CAT was slow early,
advanced two wide between horses around the turn and finished willingly. PRAY WITH FAITH swung wide into the stretch while trailing and finished fastest
outside. SUCCESS HURRICANE wasn't far back inside and lacked the needed closing. STILL CHIEF had early striking position, advanced four wide
around the turn then flattened out. PATAZ was fractious in the gate, moved to a short lead before going a furlong, stayed just out from the inside and tired.
BAYTOWN GLORY bobbled leaving the gate and failed to matter. BLUEGRASS POSSE was outrun.

brisk hand ride to the end. SHOWER THE PEOPLE wasn't far back along the rail, vied into the final furlong but couldn't stay with the winner. WELL BORN

finished after seven furlongs. WHERE'S THE BEN'S steadied three wide between horses early on the first turn then wasn't a factor. OWIN chased two wide,

TACKED UP had early position outside, moved three wide to a short lived lead after a half then couldn't stay with the winner. LOON was slow early, made a
wide run into the stretch then flattened out. WICKEDLY TRUE chased the early leader, moved two wide to a short lead nearing the quarter pole then tired.
