Footnotes
ROCKYSBUCKAROO broke readily, was urged inside foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, shook clear entering the turn and steadily widened
his advantage under pressure. WHISKEY DASH, urged three wide, then four deep on the turn pursuing the pacesetter, couldn't close the gap on that rival
but prevailed for the place honors. GETTININTOMISCHIEF settled last while angling to the inside early, shifted out five wide entering the lane and continued
with some interest to improve position. TARTAN THE BULL tracked just off the second flight in early stages, was urged to advance between foes in close
quarters racing through the turn to upper stretch but had no closing bid. MIDNIGHT BOLT angled to the inside early tracking just off the second flight,
advanced to contention along the rail entering the lane but flattened out late. UNCLE HAL, urged between foes prompting the pacesetter, gave way into
upper stretch.

Footnotes
NAVAL WAVE was urged inside foes from the outset disputing the pace into the turn, shifted out entering upper stretch while edging forward to a narrow
advantage and held BELLARIFIC on a safe margin to the end under pressure. The latter was urged to the lead between foes soon after the start, forced the
pace outside the eventual winner to upper stretch and continued to contest the issue willingly to the end. GRANDMARY tracked off the second flight along
the inside, shifted out nearing midstretch and continued with interest between foes to prevail for a share while closing the gap. BILLYSBIRTHDAYGIRL, in
touch with the leaders three wide prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, faded into upper stretch. BEND THE KNEE angled to the inside
tracking off the first flight racing into the turn but had no closing bid. BROKEN LOVE, unhurried between foes dropping well off the leaders, continued evenly
into the stretch. TETON THAI dropped back to last in early stages and passed only tiring rivals. COMMISSION ACTRESS proved no factor. MICHIGAN
GIRL tracked the leaders outside a rival in second and gave way racing into the turn.

Footnotes
ISLA BONITA broke out bumping GALLETA, was righted while shifting inwards leaving the chute to gain terms with the leaders attending the pace under
light rating, moved to press the issue outside that foe on the far turn, edged clear in upper stretch, then drifted out in the closing stages while extending the
margin under pressure. WHAT A KNOCKOUT tracked off the second flight near the inside racing to the first turn, switched out three wide entering the
backstretch, was prompted in pursuit of the leaders in that path through the far turn past midstretch and proved best of the others. FAST FASHION ducked
out at the start, was quickly righted, then urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, dueled for command through the far turn to upper
stretch and weakened late. BEE DANNA tracked off the second flight inside foes in early stages, switched out to advance four wide between foes into the
lane and improved her position to the end. RAINOUT settled last along the inside, angled out five wide racing into upper stretch and made some belated
progress. WATCH ME TANGO tracked off the second flight outside foes but had had no closing bid. ELVIRA HANCOCK shied avoiding FAST FASHION at
the start. pulled her way between to gain a position in the second flight, tracked just off the leaders to the far turn and faded into upper stretch. STILLHER
tracked the leaders inside a rival in second flight to the backstretch and faded entering the far turn. GALLETA, bumped at the start, was settled outside foes
and soon dropped out.

STRIKING CHROME was rated off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch, then shifted out producing a solid late response between
foes, surged to the lead under pressure and was taken in hand nearing the wire. PRINCESS NINA tracked off the first flight outside the eventual winner
racing to the backstretch, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch advancing on the leaders, then moved to challenge for command in the closing stages
while just outkicked by the winner. TAP DANCE FEVER sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, was roused
to widen midstretch but failed to sustain that momentum. GOLDEN OLDIE, in touch prompting a rival's pace racing to the far turn, weakened between foes
in the closing stages. BALL LIGHTNING tracked off the second flight outside rivals and made some mild progress late. LADY DOMINANCE reared at the
break while getting away very slowly and never gained contention. CHEERLEADER BARB tracked off the second flight along the inside to the far turn but
had no closing bid. MARKETABILITY tracked off the second flight between foes and steadily faded nearing the lane.

ALL GOOD TIMES was settled last while shifting off the inside on the backstretch, advanced on the leaders four wide on the turn into upper stretch and
produced a steady late response to wrest a clear advantage under pressure in the final sixteenth. BAND SWEETHEART, urged dictating the pace on a
narrow margin racing a bit off the rail, maintained the advantage into upper stretch, was collared by the winner late but gamely held a rival for the place
honors. CAUGHT UP IN YOU tracked off the first flight while angling to the inside early, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest inside
foes while being outkicked for second. CHICK'S SHADOW, carried out a bit at the start, was righted to gain a forward placing prompting the pace to the turn
and faded between foes leaving midstretch. R PREROGATIVE ducked out at the start, was righted to track off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn,
was urged to challenge three deep between foes entering the lane but quickly came up empty.

GLOBAL BRAND stumbled at the start , was settled last leaving the chute, shifted outside rivals racing to the backstretch, was prompted to steadily gain
position three wide racing into the far turn, split rivals in that path nearing upper stretch, swung four wide entering the lane and produced a solid closing
response to narrowly prevail in time under right handed encouragement. EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing
to the backstretch, came through inside the leader to wrest command leaving midstretch but just failed to contain the winner. SPEED SALSA tracked off the
second flight between foes to the backstretch, angled inside after a half, steadily gained position along the rail in the closing stages and edged a rival for a
share nearing the wire. CLASSY OF COURSE was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch to bid for
command three wide between foes in the lane but lacked the needed final kick. FALL MOON settled last to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch
and continued to improve position inside foes in the closing stages. TWIRLING STAR sped to the lead while angling to the rail racing to the first turn,
dictated the pace on a narrow advantage just off inside racing into upper stretch but gave out once headed leaving midstretch. COURTLY KITTY settled
inside foes racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. SUCCESSFUL LEGACY tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight, was urged to lodge
a brief bid nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. FOXGLOVE, reserved between foes racing to the backstretch, offered no rally. FOXY
LADY tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight to the far turn and emptied out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CLARIST broke sharply, set the pace on a clear margin along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch while being roused to repel
a rival's challenge and went clear late under brisk handling. RISEN CHANGE tracked the pacesetter from just out of striking distance leading the second
flight on a narrow margin off the rail in the opening stages, advanced on the leader to challenge for command racing into upper stretch but proved no match
in the last furlong. RIDGELYSREDHOT tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch and continued
evenly. MY BLONDE MARY, shuffled back out of tight quarters just after the start, raced four wide through the turn, then shifted inwards entering the lane to
gain some position between foes late. TEGLA tracked the pacesetter four wide as part of the second flight to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane.
SAVED AT THE WIRE tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight and faded entering the turn. GLOVANNA dropped out early.

Footnotes
LION CHARMER was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, switched out after a half, was prompted to advance three wide on the
far turn to upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. EXPRESS PHAROAH angled to the inside
tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight to the far turn, was shuffled back entering the second bend, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch
and continued with interest to close the gap. HIGHLY NOTED, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second bend,
dueled through the far turn to upper stretch, turned back a rival to edge forward midstretch but was collared in late stages. LUIS TWO GUNS was firmly
rated stalking just outside the pacesetter in the opening half, pressed that rival on the far turn but came up empty in the drive. IT'S MANDATORY settled last
along the inside to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into the lane and improved his position. TOP BOMB tracked the pacesetter three wide
between foes in second flight to the backstretch and steadily faded into upper stretch. HELLFIRE BOB, slow into stride, settled near the inside and failed to
menace. GEORGIA PINES, caught four wide racing through the first turn to the backstretch gaining terms with the second flight, was prompted to make
some brief progress outside foes but retreated early. EL TOTO soon dropped out.

Footnotes
LADY JEAN tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and produced a steady late
response to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. R AVERIE LYNN prompted the pace inside foes, then eased off the leaders to track those foes
along the rail racing into the turn, came through inside the pacesetter to challenge for command midstretch but was outkicked. LOVIELEE urged between
foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, edged clear nearing upper stretch while shifting out but failed to sustain that momentum. BROADWAY
PEGGY was rated off the second flight along the inside racing into the turn, came around a tiring rivals to split foes just off the inside entering the stretch
and continued willingly to just miss for a share. KATIE SCARLETT tracked off the second flight three deep between foes, angled out five wide entering
upper stretch but had no closing kick. WEE MS. BURNZIE, restless in the gate, was settled inside foes, saved ground to upper stretch and passed inside
some tiring rivals. STACK SHACK settled outside foes, was fanned wide into the stretch and made no real impression. LADY NOY broke sharply, prompted
the pace three wide to the turn and gave way. MISS MARGARET ANN, going erratically between foes in the opening stages while part of the second flight,
angled to the rail nearing the turn and soon gave way. RAZZLEDAZZLEM tracked off the second flight outside foes in early stages and steadily faded racing
into the turn.
