CONTACT TRACING chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, asked for more approaching the three-eighths pole, gained the lead into the lane
then drew off while being kept to the task. ALPINE GHOST set the pace from the two path into the far turn, was challenged in mid-turn, could not keep up
with the top one into the lane then kept on to be far clear from the next rival. SONIC BURN was unhurried while in the three or four path into the turn, kept
after into the lane and gained the show spot late. KING ZION chased the pace from the two path into the lane, could not gain on the others and lost the
show spot late. HOLY CROSS chased the pace from the two path into the turn, began losing ground after the three-eighths pole and was empty entering the
lane. SMOOTH ENDEAVOR was off slowly to spot the field several lengths, continued near the rail while far back and was never in it.

Footnotes
GHOSTLIGHTER raced in the two path into the far turn when never far back, waited behind a wall of rivals nearing the quarter pole, angled to the rail
approaching the lane, cut the corner, caught the brief leader outside the eighth pole then gamely put away that runner in the last sixteenth. PATS
PROPERTY was unhurried while off the inside, bid four wide through the turn, entered the lane four wide and with momentum, led once straightened near
the three-sixteenths pole, was engaged by the winner outside the eighth pole then could not stay with that one late. COMMANDEER trailed for half while in
the two or three path, bid from the four path into the lane, had aim on the top two outside the eighth pole and could not gain further while clear for the show
spot. GOOD FIRST stalked the pace three wide into the far turn, was asked for more into the lane then weakened. NIAGARA CHARLIE set the pace from
the two path into the turn, was under pressure from several others entering the lane then gave way. PADDY'S HOUSE was close to the pace into the turn
while near the inside then was done nearing the five-sixteenths pole.

AUBERGE stalked the pacesetter while in the two or three path through the turn, moved to engage that one entering the lane, was under a lengthy drive
through the lane and edged up inside the sixteenth pole. EVER WONDER set the pace while near the rail through the turn, continued with the advantage
into the lane, was caught by the winner just inside the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. MYEERAH chased the to two through the turn and into the lane
and finished evenly. BLOOD CURDLING raced in the two or three path through the turn and never was a serious threat. SUGARSUGARSUGAR was never
a factor while racing near the rail. JE SUIS BELLE raced close up early before the first call and along the rail, continued on the inside into the turn and
steadily faded.

MOONLIGHT DANCING rated on a clear lead through the turn, was well clear into the lane when under a hold, was asked nearing the sixteenth briefly,
settled back in hand until late, shook up left-handed one time and continued under minimal urging. RHODA'S JEWELL was unhurried while off the inside
down the backstretch, continued in the three path when gaining momentum, moved three wide after the three-eighths pole, continued on a steady pace
while gaining on the leader and was clearly second best. SPECIAL CONQUEST saved ground through the far turn and lacked a response through the lane.
CROWELLA chased the winner into the far turn then tired. OXBOWINDY was always outrun while in the five path through the turns and the ten path through
the lane.
