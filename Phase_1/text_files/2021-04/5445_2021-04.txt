Footnotes
J SERINO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, responded to steady urging and was up in the closing yards. IRISH
POLO raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. NEVADAN set a pressured pace, responded when
challenged nearing the three-eighths pole, vied, opened a clear margin into the lane and gave way grudgingly late. MIRROR IMAGE showed no early
speed, raced eighth-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. ASSETS INCLUDED settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
turn, angled out further into the stretch and back inside nearing the sixteenth pole and finished evenly late. TEXAS LONG BOW pressed the pace from the
inside and gave way through the final furlong. AWESOME IMAGE was forwardly placed early, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths
pole, vied and weakened in the drive. Due to a timer malfunction internal fractions are unavailable and the final time was hand timed.

Footnotes
JUST A KISS AWAY was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with SHELTERED BAY, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear
margin into the lane and drew off with little need of urging. QUICK TO FUSS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn, could
not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. SHELTERED BAY disputed the pace while racing three-wide for a half and
gave way. MISCHIEF MAMA settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. MISS SKYLER lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CRIMINAL RECORD was off slow, raced seven-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.
LOTSA LENA showed brief speed and weakened.

CHATTER BAR raced unhurried early, advanced seven-wide through the turn, reached the leaders into the lane, vied with TRACK BOUND and drew off
through the closing yards. TRACK BOUND settled off the leaders early, moved up five-wide to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, responded when
challenged by the winner nearing the five-sixteenths marker, vied, could no match strides with the winner late but finished well to hold the place. FLIGHT
SPEED lacked early foot, raced seven-wide through the turn, rider lost whip in mid-stretch and continued on to finish with a steady bid. CLUB CHAMP was
forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. MORE FIREWATER raced just off the leaders from the inside,
angled out approaching the stretch and did not threaten. GRANDPA JACK dueled for the lead from off the rail for three furlongs and weakened. ROYAL
DUDE disputed the pace from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened after going a half. ANGEL OF THE CITY vied for the lead
from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. RULING THAT STORM was off slow, lagged far back and was eased through the

four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved eighth-wide through the second turn and gradually weakened. ARTISTIC MINISTRY
raced off the pacesetters early, moved seven-wide through the second turn and weakened.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT GARDEN stalked the leaders while racing five-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and quickly drew off. SUNRISER sprinted
clear at once, raced four-wide while setting the pace and yielded to the winner through the final furlong. SECOND GRACE was checked soon after the start,
raced unhurried early, moved seven-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position but failed to sustain her bid. LITTLE MISS BELLE showed no
early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and failed to threaten. DOMESTICATION was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the
second turn and gradually weakened. TWITTERATI raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, was pulled up before going three-quarters and
walked off.

Footnotes
PARAWAN dueled for the lead with BLUE CHIP BETTY while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and held sway to the wire.
COLLECTING STARS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain on the winner
late. SHE BEGAN AGAIN raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. SINGING NICOLE was forwardly placed
from off the rail and gradually gave way. BLUE CHIP BETTY disputed the pace with the winner while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half. NOT
THAT I RECALL lacked early foot, raced eighth-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SKY VUE raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide
through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
GRANDPA A. C. settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and was fully extended to hold off the
closing AGUA DORADO to prevail. AGUA DORADO was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved eight-wide through the turn and was gaining
on the winner late. ST. GEEZY pressed the pace of ABOVE THE LAW while racing four-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the three-eighths
marker, vied and gave way grudgingly in the drive. WRITE ITINTHE DUST pressed the pace while racing six-wide, moved up to offer a bid in mid-stretch,
vied and gave way late. LODESTONE raced off the pacesetters early, moved nine-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. TEMPLE SPIRIT lacked
early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not threaten. MANCUSO AT THE MIC raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn
and failed to rally. BROTHER BEAUCHAMP was void of early speed, raced eight-wide through the turn and was not a factor. KEATON lacked early foot,
raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. ABOVE THE LAW broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide and weakened in
the drive. CATASTROPHIC FORCE showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened. DEPUTY KNIGHT lagged throughout.

Footnotes
RED CLEM was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up five-wide to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead nearing the
quarter and held safely to the wire. RUN FOREVER raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the second
turn and finished with a steady bid. MERCY RULE raced five-wide through the first turn, moved six-wide through the second turn and finished with some late
run. PEPPERS ACE raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and failed to gain
late. ZIPPY GROOM steadied soon after the start, raced unhurried early, moved seven-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and
found his best stride late. ZERO SUM GAME threw his head soon after the start, raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the second turn
and finished evenly late. JEN LORS LEGACY lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. IRON ALEX was forwardly
placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and gradually weakened. BROTHER BOB set a pressured pace for five-eighths and weakened.
HONG KONG COWBOY pressed the pace while racing four-wide, offered a bid nearing the half and weakened soon after. TON EIGHTY lacked early speed
and was eased after going five furlongs. IF I HAD A NICKEL was pulled up after going five furlongs and vanned off.
