Footnotes
NICOLE GRACE unhurried in the beginning, advanced around the far turn while angled out, struck the front in upper stretch, cleared inner rivals, drifted in
through the final furlong and remained clear. KEEP IT CLASSY settled off the pace, angled five wide leaving the far turn, rallied while widest and got up for
second. STARSHIP SKY got bumped by inside rival at the start, traveled off the rail in mid-pack, entered the stretch three wide, was floated in by the winner
then steadied at the sixteenth pole and lost the place. BLAZINONBAYOU stumbled at the start, stalked in the two path then a bit off the rail into the far turn,
lacked room in upper stretch, angled out and kept on through the deep stretch. SLEWPYS LAST SONG bumped leaving the gate, set the pace inside, met
the challenge from BIG PASSION on the far turn, narrowly showed the way into the stretch and gave way. DUAL REALITY broke out and bumped foe in the
beginning, tracked inside then came out nearing the stretch and never made an impact. BIG PASSION broke out and bumped rival at the start, raced five
then three wide around the first turn while. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT NICOLE GRACE DID DRIFT IN BUT DID NOT
TAKE THE PATH OF STARSHIP SKY AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
LEPRINO sped clear into the first turn, lost command at the five-eighths, chased the leader past the half-mile pole, re-bid around the second bend, cleared
approaching the quarter pole and widened in the final furlong. KENZOU'S RHYTHM traveled along the inside then angled out into the backstretch, went
three to four wide around the far turn, showed a mild rally and bested the rest. FABOZZI tracked two wide on the first turn, moved further off the rail on the
backstretch then came back to the two path for the far turn and weakened. BIG BAD GARY hopped at the start, chased three wide into the first turn then
went up to challenge leaving that bend, put a head in front at the five-eighths, kicked clear approaching the half-mile marker, lost command mid-way through
the far turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
BARRAZA brushed from inside at the start, took control early then moved clear, inched away around the turn, asked in upper stretch and drew off under
strong hand urging. DONCIC had early speed outside BARRAZA then chased that rival to the turn, lost ground early on the bend then closed the gap
entering the stretch, stayed within striking distance to the furlong pole but proved no match in deep stretch. SIR FLATTER stalked the speed outside a rival,
went three wide into the turn, came in and bumped PERFECTO AMOR at the five-sixteenths, angled in leaving the bend and finished evenly. ROADSIDE
broke out and bumped PERFECTO AMOR, lagged behind early, saved ground into the stretch and passed tired rivals. CROSS INDIAN broke out and
brushed rival at the start, angled out on the backstretch, came three wide into the stretch, drifted out in the lane and was never a factor. PERFECTO AMOR
bumped from inside at the start, chased in the two path then moved to the rail on the turn, got bumped and put in tight quarters at the five-sixteenths,
switched outside rival into the stretch and weakened.

BRISTOL BAYOU stalked outside the top pair, went five wide into the turn, bid outside at the three-eighths, took over mid-way around the turn, cleared
FLAT OUT JOY with a furlong to go and inched away. FLAT OUT JOY dueled for command from outside, put away inside rival at the three-eighths but
received another challenge from outside, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths, stayed on through the lane and finished well clear for second. BALLET DE
COUR chased on the inside, angled out and went between foes leaving the turn and outfinished WILD ARCH for the show honors. WILD ARCH tracked
outside a rival then angled in on the turn, saved ground into the lane and got edged for third. VAROMA forwardly placed in the early going, went three wide
into the turn, exited the bend three deep or four wide and weakened. DYNAPOWER settled at the back, saved ground along the inside then came out in
upper stretch and failed to menace. MALIBU MISTRESS dueled for the lead from inside, could not keep pace midway around the bend, dropped back while
two wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI SUNRISE stumbled a bit leaving the gate but recovered quickly to set the pace inside a pair of rivals, inched away on the turn, led two wide into
the stretch, urged right-handed and held well. AGREETODISAGREE chased outside the top pair early, outside a rival on the turn, three wide into the lane,
put in a mild bid late and closed the gap. DANCING DANA stumbled at the start, raced up close outside the pacesetter, chased two to three wide into the
drive and finished evenly. K P KAN DO settled inside, saved ground to the stretch and lacked a rally. WARREN'S MEMORABLE tracked two wide around
the turn and never threatened. BOLD ARTICLE trailed the field early outside a trio of rivals, entered the turn five wide, exited four wide and was never a
factor. MAMA SUPERIOR raced off the rail then four wide into the turn, traveled between rivals around the bend and into the stretch and came up empty.

and bumped foe in upper stretch and weakened. TAKEO went five then four wide around the clubhouse turn, four to three wide on the second bend and
weakened.

Footnotes
STRESSED broke well and angled in quickly, set the pace inside, asked at the top of the lane and kicked clear under energetic hand urging. GINJA well
placed early behind the top trio, saved ground from inside, brushed with QUEEN OF ARENDELL entering the stretch, then finished well along the inside to
prove second best. BOWL OF CHERRIES settled off the rail, took the turn four wide and gained the show. CAPAREGIME chased outside the top pair, put
in a mild bid three deep around the turn, could not sustain the momentum leaving the bend and weakened. QUEEN OF ARENDELL broke out, showed early
speed outside the leader, chased in the two path around the bend, brushed with inner rival into the stretch and tired. JEANNE B raced near the back of the
pack, was taken in hand through the turn and was never a factor. FLAPS UP steadied briefly off heels early, went two then three wide around the turn and
failed to menace.

Footnotes
LI'L GRAZEN settled off the pace, advanced four then three wide around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and drew clear. HOMEHOME stalked the
pace from outside, raced outside a rival or three wide into the turn, moved in a path and took aim two wide into the stretch, could not kick on the winner but
proved second best. LIBERALISM dueled from inside then cleared rival past the half-mile pole, showed the way through the turn, lost command in upper
stretch and flattened to third. LITTLE MISS ELLIE tracked three wide into the turn, angled four wide leaving the bend and kept on to fill out the superfecta.
TIME FOR EBBY chased off the rail then dropped back leaving the backstretch, raced two to three wide around the turn, angled out in the stretch and
improved position. VELLA forwardly placed from inside, angled out leaving the turn and weakened. JAN JAN CAN entered the turn two wide, angled out into
the four path and lacked further response. KLEEN KARMA hopped and came away slowly, went outside rivals on the backstretch, took the turn four then
five wide and lacked a rally. TRINA dueled for the lead from outside early then chased the leader to the turn, checked off heels past the quarter pole, came
two wide into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
SATURDAY HEIST sat off the pace, advanced from outside a trio of rivals into the turn then put a head in front a quarter mile out, cleared leaving the turn
and powered away. UNCAGED KITTY dropped back early then advanced inside up the backstretch, waited for room near the five-sixteenths, entered the
stretch two wide and finished well for a clear second. MY TIGRESS dueled for the lead from outside, was overtaken at the quarter pole and gave way in the
stretch. MAMAS GOT CASH chased well off the rail early, went between rivals into the turn, moved into the three path then back out four wide into the
stretch and weakened. BIG CALI GIRL stumbled leaving the gate, entered the turn two wide, angled five wide leaving the bend and could not rally. LIFE'S
EMOTIONS dueled from inside, chased the top pair past the quarter pole and tired. CHIQUITA PIQUITA was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, went
three wide into the turn, dropped back around the bend, came five wide into the stretch and was through early.
