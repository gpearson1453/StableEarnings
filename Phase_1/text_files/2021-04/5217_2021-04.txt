ABIGAIL LEE rallied on the turn drawing even abreast rival in upper stretch wearing foe down to draw out late. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE broke sharply setting
the pace through the turn, hooked from the outside in upper stretch would prove no match while saving place near the rail. WACKER'S GIRL a step slow
through the turn raced three path down the lane finding best stride late. AUGMENTING ASSETS chased close up through the turn then weakened in the
four path the final eighth. STORM OF EIGHTEEN breaking slowly was always outrun. MINE ALONE raced mid pack fading into upper stretch. CABARET
FLEUR folded up early.
