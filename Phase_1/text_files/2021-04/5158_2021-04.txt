IDA CLAIRE was well placed prompting the leader, pounced on that one two wide on the second turn, dueled to mid stretch then gradually edged clear
driving. STREET DANCING set the pace under pressure from the winner to the second turn, was collared but battled determinedly to mid stretch then was
tiring and just saved the place. GHOSTLY GAL was chasing the top two to the second turn, was outkicked while saving ground to the stretch then did not
threaten the winner and missed second. MISCHIEF FREE was also chasing the pacesetters, raced two wide to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong.
KOKO'S MOM settled to the second turn then saved ground to no avail. PASSIONATE ROAD was also allowed to settle for a half mile then tried to rally
three wide on the second turn gave way in the stretch.

MAY SONG assumed command of the early fractions while saving ground, was roused at the head of the stretch, confronted late by MIA SOLINA but had
enough to hold on for the win. MIA SOLINA chased the early pace while saving ground, continued to save ground while close up into the stretch, mounted a
late rally in the stretch to pressure MAY SONG but couldn't get past that rival while still besting the rest. SWEET TOPPER saved ground at the back of the
field early, continued to save ground along the turn, swung out for the drive and made a late push for third, though not challenging the top two. GREY
ABBEY settled midpack, advanced position while two wide on turn, no late rally in the stretch. CAL'S GIRL settled early while saving ground, moved up
along the turn and into the stretch while still running along the rail, but could not continue that bid. BADGER GAL settled midpack early, outrun while four
wide on the turn, no late response in the stretch. RAY RAY IS GONE chased the early pace while saving ground, was outrun on the turn and flattened out in
the drive.

saving ground, continued to save ground off the turn, was passed by PAPPY BOYINGTON inside the eighth pole and had no late rally while saving third.

AMERICAN BOURBON sped to a long lead in the first half mile, remained well in front to the stretch and was kept to task to hold. STELLACZAR was settled
to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch and bested the others. COLD BREW KELLY had no speed, settled to the half, was two wide to the stretch
but could only close the gap. LIFE IN PARADISE raced three wide on the first turn, settled to the second turn then was two wide and did not rally. SAYITALL
got pushed out five wide by DAISY FIELD to the backstretch, raced with the rest chasing to the second turn then was four wide but did not threaten in the
drive. LADY OF THE HOUSE lagged to the second turn then never threatened. DAISY FIELD lugged out into the first turn and carried SAYITALL out, was
outrun to the stretch and not a factor. ASPEN AGAIN raced closest to the winner for six furlongs but gave way in the stretch. YOU'RE ALL TALK was
always outrun then had the saddle slip on the second turn, was eased in the stretch but walked off.
