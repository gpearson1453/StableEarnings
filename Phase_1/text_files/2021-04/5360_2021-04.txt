LUCKY DAY DIVA moved to a long lead on the backstretch, stayed out from the rail around the turn and lasted while shortening stride. BECCA BIANCA
angled out sharply early on the backstretch, raced the three path around the turn then made up ground too late. BONITA LASSIE left the gate several
lengths behind the field, angled wide nearing the stretch then finished willingly outside. BIG PUMA turned her head to the inside just before the gate opened,
left several lengths behind the field, saved ground and passed tired ones. MAGIC MELODY was fractious in the gate then was outrun. SLIP SLIDIN briefly
showed speed. VERBIEN O. P. chased the winner into the turn then stopped.

COMMISSIONER BIGGS chased outside into the turn, took over two wide midway on the bend, drew out in early stretch and held under urging.
OBROTHER ITSYLVIA lagged early, made a run in the three path around the turn, moved closer in early stretch then continued evenly. PAPA TONY came
in, bumped BEND IN THE RIVER approaching the main track, was bumped repeatedly by that one nearing the end of the backstretch, stayed out from the
rail while not far back into the final furlong then flattened out. A MAIZE ZING RIP took command at once, moved clear before going a quarter, stayed along
the rail around the turn then tired. BEND IN THE RIVER was bumped while not far back nearing the main track, bore out into PAPA TONY several times
nearing the end of the backstretch then stopped. STONE SCULPTOR was finished early.
