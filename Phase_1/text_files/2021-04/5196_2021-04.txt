Footnotes
MARSAC cleared off entering the turn in the two-path, and maintained command through the stretch under a mild drive. TRINNI SUMMER pursued the
winner toward the inside from the start, could not seriously threaten and was clearly second best. CHEVAL DORE swung four wide leaving the turn, and
offered a mild response to best the remainder. DREAMING OF GUS saved ground and did not factor. LITTLE DUDE gave futile two to three wide for
three-eighths of a mile, and tired. KOLOHE PRINCE broke slowly and was outrun three wide. TONATIUH broke slowly and was outrun two to three wide.
SMARTY J AND B showed little inside. DR. ALBERT was no factor two wide.

Footnotes
TERRY'S DREAM was in range outside down the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the turn, stalked inside around the bend, angled out near the
quarter pole, rallied between foes in upper stretch, took the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and drove clear. MAUREENLOVESFRANK bumped with
APOINTED early, prompted the pace outside of that foe in the three path, churned on outside through the lane and was up for the place late. APPOINTED
was bumped by LEYENDA at the start, bumped with MAUREENLOVESFRANK nearing the seven-eighths pole, set the pace in the two path, led past the
eighth pole and weakened through the final sixteenth. MISS ITALY broke inwardly and slowly, saved ground well back, swung out near the quarter pole and
improved position. LEYENDA broke out and bumped APPOINTED at the start and played no further factor while saving ground. YELLOWSTONE GIRL had
some speed four wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
MISS MIKAELA sped to the front after the start, left her pursuers behind going comfortably around the turn inside, and widened steadily while kept to light
pressure. HERE HERE bumped with MIAMI GOLD at the start, was ridden along advancing four wide midway on the turn, could not reach the winner and
was clearly second best. BAHAMIAN BEAUTY chased three wide early, made no progress and ran on much best of the others. BELLA SOFI saved ground
and tired around the turn. FLYING BLACK broke out bumping MIAMI GOLD into HERE HERE, pressed the winner early, and tired before going a half-mile.
MIAMI GOLD got bumped into HERE HERE by FLYING BLACK and checked back at the start, and was never in contention. GRACEFULLY broke slowly
and trailed well out in the track.

Footnotes
STRIKE THE TOP tracked the pace three wide around the first turn, moved into a clear second nearing the far turn, stalked two wide around that bend,
closed steadily through the lane and was up late. FLY FLY AWAY set the pace along the rail and led until deep stretch. POPPY'S BOYS raced off the pace
two wide, inched closer three wide around the far turn and rallied outside to gain the show. MONY saved ground in midpack, swung out in upper stretch and
had a mild rally. KICKS ON SIXTY SIX raced well back inside early, went two wide around the far turn, came five wide into the lane and never threatened.
EASY STRIDE prompted the pace two wide around the first turn and faded inside around the far turn. QUINTO SOL was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
WILD CAT WEST drafted along behind the leaders around the turn two wide, angled to the far outside in upper stretch, closed steadily and was up near the
finish. MAXI MOON advanced four then five wide after six furlongs, leaned in brushing with SOCIAL EQUALITY in upper stretch while reaching a short lead,
battled gamely but was edged out inside the winner. SOCIAL EQUALITY saved ground edging forward to the middle of the pack up the backstretch, moved
out four wide lodging a bid turning for home, got brushed and bumped between MAXI MOON and SADIO coming to the furlong grounds, and was
outfinished from there inside the top two. SADIO sat perched three wide outside the dueling leaders into the turn, poked a head in front at the quarter-pole,
bumped
with
SOCIAL
EQUALITY
while
battling
for
command
in
upper
stretch,
drifted
inward
and
gave
way
through
the
late
stages.
GLOBALTROUBLECOCO checked off the heels of HALO'S DANCE in the chute, raced two to three wide and improved position without threatening. HERE
COMES BULLET vied up front inside DAMIR for six furlongs, and gave way. MORNING TRIAL broke slowly, advanced through the middle fractions, and
tired in the five-path approaching the lane. HALO'S DANCE raced far back near the inside. YITO MACHINE lost his footing slightly at the break, and tired
four wide after a half-mile. PARMENIDES was outrun inside. DAMIR vied outside HERE COMES BULLET for nearly six furlongs, and drifted four wide tiring
into the stretch. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE TRAINER OF SOCIAL
EQUALITY AGAINST MAXI MOON, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
MONA STELLA was up close three wide early, angled into the two path early on the first turn, stalked from the rail down the backstretch and around most of
the far turn, angled out near the quarter pole, seized command nearing the eighth pole and powered clear while drifting out under right-handed urging.
YAFA saved ground off the pace early, raced three wide around the far turn and finished willingly to be clearly second best. BIG BAND LUZZIANN was
bumped at the start, set the pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. MARY OF SCOTLAND bumped with BIG BAND LUZZIANN at the start, chased
the pace three wide, angled in entering the far turn and lacked a rally. CRYSTAL COAST pressed the pace in the three path around the first turn, chased
two wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. JADE EMPRESS was in range two wide while fighting rating and was through after a half.

Footnotes
DIGITAL FOOTPRINT went along in range two to three wide on the turns, rallied outside through the lane and wore down BIG MAN BOB late. BIG MAN
BOB established a manageable pace inside, was clear a furlong out, but could not hold off the top one. SPINNING KITTEN saved ground in easy striking
range for six furlongs, loomed a threat through upper stretch, lacked room inside DIGITAL FOOTPRINT and behind BIG MAN BOB with a sixteenth to go
and could not be fully set down at that point. GUACO was in the second flight near the inside for six furlongs, moved out for the drive and gained only mildly.
BEACH TRAFFIC brushed with PAWNBROKER soon after the start, went four wide around the far turn at the back, and made no meaningful progress late.
WISE TO LISTEN was no factor two then three wide. PAWNBROKER exchanged brushes with BEACH TRAFFIC after the start, put in a run four then three
wide around the far turn, but flattened out into the lane. SEA TRIDENT prompted the pace outside BIG MAN BOB, and gave way midway on the far turn.
RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

stretch, continued on the left lead to the sixteenth pole and widened under a drive. LIESEL tracked the pace three wide, took the lead nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, had no answer for the winner's move near the quarter pole but stayed on to remain well clear of the rest. JOST DREAMY raced two
wide in midpack, edged closer three wide nearing the quarter pole but was no match for the top two from there. SHAKEM failed to menace while racing four
wide. TWILIGHT GALAXY stalked the pace two wide, bid nearing the far turn, vied between foes around much of the but faltered in the lane. PRETTY
LIDDIE was bumped at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. PANDORICA hit the starting gate, raced two wide and played no factor. ISLAND
VIBE vied inside for a half and stopped. SHELLPHONE bumped with PRETTY LIDDIE at the start, had early speed two wide and stopped.

MISS JEN settled in the middle of the field early, was under a drive three wide a quarter-mile out, rallied steadily on her left lead and prevailed through the
last 70 yards. PASSION PLUS was unhurried for six furlongs, swung four wide approaching the stretch, and finished gamely on the far outside. TOWA
stalked the leaders in the clear three wide, rallied to a short lead in upper stretch, then was outfinished inside the top two. SASSY JUSTICE saved ground in
striking range to the stretch, and finished one-paced. TONY'S ROSE led in the two-path while resisting restraint on the first turn, moved inside showing the
way to the stretch, and gave way past the furlong marker on her left lead. CODRINGTON broke slowly, and was no factor inside. FANTASTIC KINGDOM
broke awkwardly spotting the field two to three lengths, and never reached contention. YAKO prompted the pace three then two wide to the far turn, and
retired. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
KATAMA MOONLIGHT set a rated pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. WICKED MERCURY stalked the winner from the rail, could not gain on
that foe but finished willingly to be clear second. UNA LUNA raced two wide in midpack around both turns and was along for the show. SNOW SHOWER
(GB) was off a step slow, saved ground and passed tiring rivals. AZIZA chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. FURIA VIKINGA (CHI)
bobbled at the start and played no factor while racing four and five wide. CHARGE ACCOUNT prompted the winner two wide and retreated in the lane.
COME STORMING failed to menace while racing three and four wide. INDICIA made little impact while racing two and three wide. PERFECT KIMBERLY S
steadied along through the opening furlong and played no factor while racing two and three wide.
