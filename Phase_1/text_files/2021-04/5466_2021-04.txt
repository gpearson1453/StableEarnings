Footnotes
GOINGTOAGOGO unhurried in the early part, moved up around the final turn, angled out entering the stretch, took command, pulled away and proved
much the best. BEE HOUSE not asked in the early going, moved up on the outside around the final turn, entered the stretch 6wide, rallied down the lane
and got up for second. DEVIL WITH A DASH raced in the middle of the field, made a late bid and was caught for second. STAR FASHION void of early
speed, showed late interest, dueled down the final stretch with DEVIL WITH A DASH, when BEE HOUSE came running late on the outside and nailed both
for the placed position. SUM NATION lacked early speed, racing outside around the first turn, made a mild bid and hung. I GOT WINGS raced within striking
distance and dropped back. MAIRSILS FIRST sprinted to the front opened up on the field and tired around the second turn.

Footnotes
ANTIETAM ROAD raced within striking distance, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out, split rivals entering the stretch, dueled down the
lane with GOLDEN PALACE, drifted in late but prevailed for the win. GOLDEN PALACE went to the front, drove clear, dueled down the home stretch, in
tight late and was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. SILENT CRY pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for
the top two. MAJESTIC SOCIETY void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. JENNOVODKA lacked early speed, moved up and hung.
STARVICTORY raced near the back, came around the first turn wide and was never close. HASHTAG SPEED raced near the middle of the field, steadied
down the backside, rank, took the advantage entering the final turn and faded. KANSAS KING pressed the early pace and dropped back. THE JOCKEY OF
#6 GOLDEN PALACE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #2 ANTIETAM ROAD FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING
REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
STANDING MAN stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up, three wide around the final turn, pulled away down the lane and won easily. MY GUITAR
dueled for the early lead, took the advantage, saved ground, couldn't match strides with the winner, but was a clear second. SIR POKERFACE lacked early
speed, saved ground around the second turn, made a late try and finished a clear third. SHAE'S DAY reserved in the beginning, moved inside, made a late
rail bid, but was no factor. MISS JENNY'S HALO raced near the back, came around the final turn on the outside and was no threat. HIGHLY CENTSABLE
dueled on the front end and dropped back.

vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner late, but held on for place. PEACEFUL VISION challenged for the early
advantage, raced close throughout and was outfinished. RACELYNN lacked early speed, moved up, made a late wide rally and finished willingly. TOSHITA

early part, improved position, but was no threat. TIZINDY QUEEN raced in the middle of the field, saved ground and put forth an even effort. FUHRCRY
raced in the back of the pack and passed tired ones late. CHIEF FALCON showed early speed and dropped back. LUMBERJACK EMPIRE raced near the
middle of the pack in the beginning and retreated. CAST YOUR CROWN raced within striking distance, dropped back and was outrun.

FOURSWEETNIECES dueled for the early lead, drove clear down the home stretch and won under steady urging. ACCUSTOMED TO HOPE pressed the
pace, raced close throughout, put forth a game effort and finished willingly. MISS INVADER raced in the middle of the pack, made a late bid and proved no
match for the top two. SHE'S A FAIR CATCH lacked early speed, moved up, finished wide and was outfinished for third. ENOUGH HEART vied for the early
advantage and weakened down the home stretch. ELLIE D CAJUN raced near the back in the beginning, moved up, racing wide, but was no factor. FICKLE
FLASH raced within striking distance, saved ground and faded. CAJUN MUSIC void of early speed, finished wide and was never close. STANG IT raced
within contention, came around the turn on the outside and dropped back. WHOLESHACKSHIMMIES always raced near the back, pulled up down the
home stretch and walked off.

GET THEM JUSTIN went to the front, saved ground, drove clear and finished well. DRILLING REPORT pressed the pace, raced close throughout, proved
no match for the winner, but was a clear second. NATEALYZE void of early speed, moved up around the second turn, racing between rivals and gained
ground down the stretch. LOUISIANA HERO raced near the middle of the pack, made a mild bid and hung. AVAILABLE STAR raced evenly near the back,
had a wide trip and was no threat. COMMANDER SCOTT was an early factor, raced wide around the first turn and faded. THAT'S D 'CAT raced within
striking distance and dropped back.

finished wide and was a clear third. UNBRIDLED PULPIT raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid and hung. MY LITTLE FLACO raced near the
middle of the pack, saved ground around the final turn, made a bid and weakened. CLEVER PRINCE raced evenly near the back and lacked a bid.
