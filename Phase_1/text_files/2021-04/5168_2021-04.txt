Footnotes
OLLIE'S PAPA'S BOY contested the lead inside UP TIME throughout, was challenged by IF THE BOOT FITS and kept that one safe late. IF THE BOOT
FITS tracked the lead three wide, bid into the lane but could not run down the winner. BUCKSHOT PETE was slow into stride, rallied five wide on the turn
and continued to close late but came up short. UP TIME contested the early lead outside the winner then was outfinished for position in the drive. BRAVE
RIFLE was in reach four wide but lacked the needed late rally. BEAR ME A MOMENT lacked the needed rally three wide. CLARK'S CODE trailed with no
apparent mishap.

KAMIKAZE JUDGE was shuffled back between rivals after the break, saved ground to move up going to the far turn, rallied in the lane and collared the
leaders late. PICKLES N ME moved four wide to bid through the far turn then could not contain the winner's late. P R WHY NOT moved three wide to bid in
the far turn and came up empty in the drive. P R STREAKIN lacked a rally three wide. I B HANDSOME was not a threat racing three wide. PRINCE B
showed speed out from the rail, inherited a clear lead out of the first turn and tired. FIRM JUSTICE saved ground and was not a threat. CRAZY STEELE
was always back. THUNDERSTORMACOMIN broke in the air and was outrun. HANDY HANNON showed speed but bolted to the outside fence leaving the
first turn, pulled up and was walked off.

Footnotes
SWINGIN DOORS showed in front after the break and made all the running, kicked well clear into the far turn, continued well and kept clear under steady
handling. MAGIC IN A HAT moved up four wide into the far turn then closed mildly in the lane while up for the place. LASTING INFLUENCE saved ground
to get nearest the winner into the lane but could not hold position late. PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER was midpack and appeared to lug in going up the
backstretch and steadied, then lacked a rally while three wide. FIVE ROSES LUNA dropped well off the early pace and moved up while never a threat. RUN
FOR RANDY tracked the early pace four wide and weakened. JAKEALINA saved ground and was not a threat. LYNNE T tired while five wide in the far turn.
DIXIE TRIXIE chased the winner early from four wide and tired. TOURIST LIKE ME was five and six wide through the first turn and never contended.

T. P. RIGHT LANE made the pace while pressured racing out from the rail, edged clear into the lane then held safe under steady handling. DAME
DANGEROUS moved up inside to bid into the lane and could not run down the winner in the closing sixteenth. SHIVERHERTIMBERS stalked the pace
three wide and could not produce the needed late run. PUT SARAH ON prompted the pace outside the winner to bid going to the far turn then weakened
from five wide into the lane. DISTINCT FLIRT was caught in tight between rivals into the first turn, stalked outside and lacked a final closing run after going
four to six wide through the far turn. LIL MISS DE BUY saved ground and lacked a bid. MISS ELLIE'S GIRL was always back. S C ANGEL was five wide in
the first turn and failed to threaten. WITCHY WINDSOR followed the pace three or four wide and tired.

LOUISE THE LASER stalked the leaders four wide to bid into the lane then continued well to be edging clear late. FANCY STOCKINGS pressed outside

leaders but lacked a final closing run. DEJA SUE was on the pace inside FANCY STOCKINGS to upper stretch and weakened late. SASSY SETA lacked a
rally four wide. HAPPY ISSUE brushed with a rival at the start and was away last then failed to threaten from along the inside. LOVE NOT WAR saved
ground and failed to mount a bid. PURE BRIGHTNESS was always back. DUSTY SKY was outrun.

Footnotes
U S S LOIS settled off the early leaders four wide to stalk the pace, rallied outside to come five wide into the lane and wore down DIRTY DIXIE ROAD late.
DIRTY DIXIE ROAD tracked the pace three wide to bid and move clear into the lane then could not contain the winner's late run. DIVA'S DIVA was just off
the early lead four wide and lacked the needed late rally. RYRYSWEETIE moved up three and four wide but could not threaten late. DISTINCT APPROVAL
made the pace for a half from inside rivals and weakened. DABBLIN CHANNEL was always back. CHARM AND SARCASM was not a factor three wide.
GIGGLES AND SMOKE saved ground and weakened. TAYLOR'S BEAUTY followed the early pace three wide and tired.

Footnotes
HERECITYKITTY was five wide in the first turn while just off the leaders, bid four wide going up the backstretch to show in front, repelled a bid from CLINE
TIME turning for home then dug in late to keep safe as MUWAAN MAT closed. MUWAAN MAT settled off the pace three wide, rallied four wide into the lane
and closed late to narrowly miss. CLINE TIME stalked the pace three or four wide to bid into the lane then went evenly late and could not hold position.
DIXIE CAT was on the pace inside and weakened nearing the lane. VIOLENT FIT was four wide in reach but lacked a solid closing bid. DIAMONDS N
SPURS lacked a solid rally racing four wide. SILENT SURPRISE was three to five wide on the turn into the lane and never threatened. DARLING GIRL
stalked the pace inside and tired. LILFEATHEREDINDIAN tired from along the inside. BETWEEN THE BUOYS saved ground and was always back.
