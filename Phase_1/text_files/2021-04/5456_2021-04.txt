Footnotes
BREAK AT DAWN was allowed to settle early while saving ground down the backstretch, made a inside move past the five sixteenths pole to move into
contention, then drew clear in the final sixteenth of a mild to prove best under right handed encouragement. NORTH OF EDEN chased the early pacer and
made a three wide bid past the quarter pole, but needed more late while gaining the place award. DIXIE MO steadied on the first turn, then went on to track
the pace down the backstretch, was sent down leaving the three eighths pole, found herself between rivals by the quarter pole under strong urging, but had
no kick in the drive while getting the show award late. QUINN MURPHY was away alertly and crossed over to the rail entering the first turn, set the pace
while uncontested, then was headed approaching the sixteenth pole and weakened late. RUBY DOES SPARKLE was three wide into the first turn, then
came into the stretch four wide but had no menace. Due to a timer malfunction the seven furlong time was unavailable.

SWIFT RED BIRD pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid entering the stretch, drew clear in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. MISS M
J set a pressured pace from the inside, dug in gamely in the stretch but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. TEXAS MAMA
chased the early pace from the inside, eased off the rail leaving quarter pole, but was empty in the drive, bested rest. FAVORITE NAN chased the early
pace three wide, then came four wide into the drive but weakened. SHERRYS BABY was away alertly then dropped back while four wide. SHE'S A RIDGE

GRANNY JEWELL was rated along early and made a four wide move on the turn to vie for command, shook clear by the furlong marker, then was kept safe
late to prove best under a drive. CIAO CIAO dueled for the early lead two to three wide, made a bid on the turn to vie for command with the winner on the
inside by the quarter pole, ran on gamely to the wire but was not quite good enough as the winner while clearly second best. HIGH DEF RIDGE was allowed
to settle early, came four wide into the stretch to offer a mild late rally. DIXIE CARROUSEL was rated early and was three wide by the quarter pole but
offered no rally. MISS SPICY was void of early speed, came four wide into the drive to pass the tiring rivals. EFFLORESCE had no rally while five to six
wide. SWEET TOMATOE PIE dueled for the lead on the inside then faltered. TWO MORE BARBO stalked the early pace four wide, then was lugging out on
the turn while stopping.

QUEETEN set a pressured pace from the inside, shook clear on the backstretch while being well handled, was sent down when under pressure by the
quarter pole, but shook clear again leaving the furlong marker, then held on gamely late under left handed urging. CARLOS SIXES was rated early and
came into the stretch four wide, closed well late but was too late. BLUE BOMBER pressed the early pace three wide, then was rated off the pace on the
backstretch, tried the winner again by the quarter pole three wide but was empty in the drive. ZENUCCI was off slowly, then was five wide down the
backstretch, advanced while four to five wide past the quarter pole but had no late gain. FRONT PAGE chased the early pace from the inside then
weakened. STARSHIP ZEUS was allowed to settle early, raced between rivals on the far turn but came up empty in the drive. SATELLITE was off slowest
spotting the field about five lengths, then was not a factor.

PILOT was slow into stride, moved over towards the rail past the three eighths pole, but lacked the needed winning rally while besting the rest. DR.

Footnotes
BAOZUN was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn, continued that bid entering the stretch, hit the front inside the sixteenth pole then
held off WILDCAT'S BLING late to prevail under a drive. WILDCAT'S BLING was well rated while four wide, then moved in to be three wide on the turn,
swung out five wide to launch a bid entering the stretch, closed well to just miss, too late. RISKEY TRICKEY was sent to the front to set the pace from the
inside, dug in gamely in the stretch and was headed leaving the sixteenths pole, but faded in deep stretch, bested rest. DUST EM was off a beat slow, then
was sent up to stalk the pace three wide, but lacked the needed winning bid. HULEN was off slowly, hustled up the inside to be with in striking distance but
was empty in the drive. TEXAS TITAN had no rally while wide. WILD TONIGHT was reserved early, came into the stretch while saving ground but had no
rally. CONGA BOY failed to menace. TEXAS PRADO chased the early pace then weakened.
