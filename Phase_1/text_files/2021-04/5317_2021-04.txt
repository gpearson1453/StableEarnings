Footnotes
T MINUS TEN opened a short lead between horses leaving the half-mile pole, angled to the inside on the turn, drew clear before a half then widened under
urging. SCOTTY SILVER ducked out into MR CLIPBOARD leaving the gate, moved outside the winner early, chased that one into the stretch then
weakened. COLBALOAF was briefly prominent after the break, fell back early on the backstretch, came well out from the rail on the turn and weakened. MR
CLIPBOARD was bumped leaving the gate, stayed out from the rail around the turn then made up ground inside. NOTORIOUS REY made the pace along
the inside for a quarter then faded. ROYAL'S INVASION went in the air at the break, left about five lengths behind the field and never caught up.

BACK SLIDER took command at once, drew clear from between rivals after a quarter, stayed out from the rail around the turn, widened into the stretch and
held under urging. MALDIVES MODEL was slow early, raced four wide around the turn and finished fast outside. WIRETAP was slow early, made a strong
four wide run around the turn to get closer nearing the stretch but failed to sustain her bid. FROSTED ANGEL broke in the air, advanced between rivals
early, stayed out form the rail around the turn and weakened in the lane. SWEET MESA was slow early, stayed inside around the turn and gained late.
PERFECT HIDEAWAY showed speed four wide into the turn then tired. GOLDEN LAW was hustled into tight quarters between rivals entering the turn,
steadied twice and fell back. LADY LYNNE raced three wide between rivals and lacked a rally. BLUE ROCKETTE briefly showed speed inside. BLISSFUL
BEHAVIOR moved between rivals to press the winner, fell back quickly on the turn and was eased up.
