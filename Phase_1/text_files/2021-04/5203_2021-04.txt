LAZARUS PROJECT slow early circled out to upper stretch surging clear near mid track. LIBERATE pressed the pace shaking clear on the turn, digging in
from the three path down the lane proved no match for wide pressure. PRIVATE DRIVE flashed early speed then faded on the turn, lagging in upper stretch
responded along the inside late to finish well. WAR ACT went evenly racing four wide to upper stretch needing more late. SMALL TOWN HERO faded on
the turn then raced evenly the final eighth. BIG TRIP pressed the early pace saving ground to upper stretch giving way late along the rail. JOHNNY U was
always outrun.
