Footnotes
NAVY SEAL vied up front while closest to the inside, shook off the other speed when straightened for home, increased advantage past the furlong marker,
enough left to hold the runner up safe late. FUNNY ACTOR in the second flight along the inside, in hand turn, followed the winner into the stretch along the
inside, shifted out in upper stretch, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late. J'S LITTLE MAN with the leaders while widest of the flight four wide into
the turn, three wide exiting, proved no match for the top two the final furlong, saved show. TRAFFIC CONTROL void of speed, continued to race well back
through the turn, angled out for the drive, finished willingly to improve through traffic. MO BETTA forwardly placed while between horses, shuffled back late
backstretch, came four wide out of the turn, went evenly through the stretch. BELLAMYS ROAN off a step slow, in some traffic early in the turn, steadied
behind horses late in the turn, went one paced through the stretch. DOVER LIGHTS lacked speed while along the inside, improved a bit into the lane, failed
to seriously menace. ZOMBIE LOBO back off the pace and the inside. SERBIAN SAILOR lacked early foot, four then five wide when with the second flight
while remaining outside, five wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. TOPF ROAD RULES with the pace while racing three wide and between rivals, gave
way in the drive. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR set or forced the pace while between horses, gave way readily late in the turn. DOWNTOWN BOY lacked speed,
shortened stride in apparent distress into the turn, pulled up, unseated rider, vanned off.

Footnotes
GALLANT PLUNGER in the second flight off the inside, three wide when beginning to advance turning for home, bid past the furlong marker, powered clear
under firm handling. BOX OF CHOCOLATES broke back, remained void of speed, four wide out of the turn, rallied for the place, no match for the winner.
ROB THE RICH forwardly placed while three wide into the turn, closer midway on the bend, vied into and through upper stretch, could not contain the top
two int he drive, saved the show. TOP GUNNER broke alertly, sprinted clear early, narrowly showed the way late turn, continued to contest the issue past
the furlong marker, weakened. DAVIDIC LINE bothered slightly at the start, trailed most of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals late while never a
threat. REEF'S DESTINY closest to the early leader, steadily faded. SEDARIS behind the early pace inside, backed up through the stretch as well.

Footnotes
COPPELIA closest to the leader up the backstretch, advanced and challenged between rivals midway on the turn, long drive, dug in late to narrowly prevail.
BERRY GOOD forwardly placed outside, advanced and challenged three wide the latter half of the turn, continued to do battle past the furlong grounds,
outkicked in the late going. PRIDDIS came out early to bother an outer rival, raced back early, improved in the two path through some traffic in the turn,
continued willingly to the wire to be up for the show, getting to the top pair. SIANARA broke alertly, cleared soon after, narrowly showed the way through the
turn, caved the final furlong, caught final strides for the show. MY MY MUNNY in the second flight in the early going, came up empty for the drive while
inside. SILVER BANSHEE failed to menace while racing three wide. FROSTED BLUE steadily faded. DEBENTURE last away, trailed throughout in showing
little.

Footnotes
FOLLOWING SEA away in good order, narrowly showed the way early off the inside, cleared toward the inside turn while still hand, set some glib fractions,
no threatened in the drive under token pressure to win geared down and ridden out. HAPPYMAC broke alertly, pressed the winner early from along the
inside, fell back off that foe into the turn, chased in vain to prove no match, clearly second best. RISING EMPIRE broke in, then was floated into the gap,
raced well back early, two path turn, came on the outside for the drive, rallied for the show, no threat to the top two. AMAZING ROCKET in mid pack while
just off the inside early, dropped to the rail midway on the turn, went one paced through the stretch to lose the show. ARMS AN ARMOR behind the leaders
while racing in the three path, failed to muster a closing response. TERAWATT settled off the pace, had nothing for the drive. MAGICALMYSTERYTOUR
broke in then came in soon after to carry RISING EMPIRE into the gap, never menaced. ALTERED finished early, well beaten.

Footnotes
TRUCULENT in the second flight while off the inside, angled out sharply turning into the stretch, set down, finished with good resolve to challenge late and
edge clear. PRODIGIOUS BAY broke alertly, set or forced the pace toward the inside, fell back, rebid, vied, grudgingly. SANTOS DUMONT settled off the
pace, moved out, four wide when advancing in the final turn, vied into the lane, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, weakened in the late
going. TASHKENT lacked speed, off the inside, mild rally to improve position a bit, no threat to the top three. BANDIT POINT void of speed, raced back,
improved while saving ground into the lane, flattened out. SUPER CONSTITUTION within striking distance while off the inside, three wide second turn,
came up empty in the drive. ALEX JOON broke back, lagged, continued to trail up the backstretch, passed a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat.
QUARTERBACK DAK off a step slow, settled in mid pack, tired in the drive. IMPOSSIBLE TASK vied up front through the first turn, shook clear before a
half, was tiring when took up sharply turning for home, stopped. PICKFORD off a step slow, was never involved.

Footnotes
EDGEWAY with the pace from the start, bumped with the runner up early, vied three wide through the turn when helping set some moderate fractions, took
over from between rivals into the stretch, clear a furlong out, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. FRANK'S ROCKETTE bumped with the
winner soon after the start, remained in the first flight in the early going, took back before a quarter, moved out and moved closer three wide turning into the
stretch, chased the winner past the furlong marker then could not get to that rival late while holding sway for the place. CASUAL void of early foot in trailing
early, moved out, advanced into the lane, staged a mild rally but also could not make inroads on the winner or runner up in the late going. WILDWOOD'S
BEAUTY came out bit early, settled behind the early pace, lodged an early move up the rail to contest the pace, continued to battle for the lead through the
turn then steadily weakened through the stretch. BEST KEPT SECRET last away to be away a step slow when bothered a bit, moved up rapidly late
backstretch, steadied, shuffled back, continued to fade the final three furlongs. MUCHO AMOR broke well, flashed some brief speed in the two path, was
finished before a half.

HE'SMYHONEYBADGER with the early pace while between rivals early, edged clear in the turn while toward the inside, steadily increased advantage
through the lane while being kept to pressure. STAR SAILOR void of speed for a half, came on the outside for the drive, rallied to be up for the place late, no
real threat to the winner. GLOBAL APPEAL off the pace while racing inside, steadied in traffic early in the turn, two path and in some traffic turning for home,
rallied, narrowly nipped for the place in the late going. MACRON off a step slow, moved closer along the inside the opening quarter, raced back, squeezed
through the rail into the stretch, improved position upper stretch then flattened out a bit in the late going. BATTLE HYMN bobbled at the break to be off
slowly, moved out, raced back, ranged up into contention with a strong move four wide late in the turn, came five wide into the stretch, closest a furlong out,
flattened out in the late going. VIOLENT GIGI mid pack while off the inside, behind some traffic turning for home, came up empty in the drive when clear.
JUSTIN SPEIGHT pressed the issue for a half on the outside, gave way in the drive. SKIP INTRO in the second flight outside, four wide into the turn,
backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
SHASHASHAKEMEUP outrun for a half, began to advance four wide late in the turn, kept coming outside, late burst to be clear at the end. ANCIENT
WARRIOR in mid pack early while inside, in some traffic into the turn, continued to save ground through the turn and into the stretch, rallied up the inside to
earn the place, could not match the winner in the late going. ONE FOR RICHIE broke well, dueled early, shook clear before a quarter, continued to show the
way by daylight through the turn toward the inside, remained well clear past the furlong marker, faltered in failing to contain the top two, narrowly saved the
show. SECRET COURIER briefly dueled inside after breaking alertly, chased the leader through the turn and then faltered in the drive. DIGITAL settled off
the pace and the inside, had little for the drive in finishing up one paced. SENOR JOBIM behind the pace toward the inside, two path turn, also failed to
muster a closing response. FROLIC MORE failed to menace while racing off the inside. STRIKE ME DOWN settled in mid pack early, in some traffic early in
the turn, began a steady fade before a half. UNCLE CHAD off slowly, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BY MY STANDARDS in the second flight first turn, floated out four wide and between horses late first turn, continued well wide in the run up the backstretch,
advanced four wide through the second turn, lost some ground to the runner up turning for home, got back to that one late and gained the nod at the wire.
RUSHIE forwardly placed along the inside, continued to prompt the issue the middle half while closest to the inside, took over inside of several rivals turning
for home, briefly clear a furlong out, could not contain the winner, well clear of the others, continued riding well past the finish wire. WELLS BAYOU broke in,
brushed, raced well back while keen the first five furlongs, came in the two path in traffic exiting the final turn, rallied for the show while not a threat to the top
two. GUN IT in tight at the start, back early, moved closer before a half, followed the runner up along the inside into the stretch, lacked a closing punch.
BLACKBERRY WINE prompted the pace while off the inside, three wide through the final turn, also was found lacking in the late going. PIONEER SPIRIT
dueled early off the rail, rated in the run up the backstretch to back the pace a bit off the inside, continued to show the way far turn, headed into the lane by
the runner up, weakened. HOME BASE floated out five wide late in the first turn, continued outside, three wide second turn, failed to muster a rally. LONG
RANGE TODDY broke out, brushed, behind the pace toward the inside, very rank while getting out a bit late in the first turn, 2nd flight backstretch, gave way
in the drive. THE SOUND lacked speed while five wide into the first turn, pulled hard, angled in a bit, came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
MIGHTY MISCHIEF broke alertly, dueled into the turn off the inside, disposed of the other speed to be clear by midway on the bend, widened through the
stretch under steady handling to be kept to task. NAME REJECTED dueled up front inside the winner in the run up the backstretch, fell back off that one
after three furlongs, chased that rival to the wire to prove no match, clearly second best. GAME DAY PLAY off a step slow, raced back early, called on for
some run in the turn, two path into the lane, staged a mild rally out in the strip to be along for the show, no threat to the top pair. TKOTCHKE broke out, was
straightened to race in the second flight in the three path, continued evenly through the stretch, caught for the show. XTREME MAYHEM off a step slow,
lacked speed, three wide, passed tiring rivals. UPSTRIKER chased the dueling leaders early, remained forward through the turn then began to weaken, lost
several positions late. APPRAISAL floated out at the start to be off a bit slowly, trailed most of the way in failing to menace. INVINCIBILITY settled in mid
pack, moved inside to save some ground out of the turn, gave way the final furlong.

Footnotes
C Z ROCKET unhurried in the early going outside, crept a bit closer late in the turn while angling out five to six wide, challenged immediately afterward,
showed the way nearing the furlong grounds and steadily edged away to the wire under steady handling. WHITMORE balked when attempting to load,
broke with the field, second flight toward the inside into the turn, brief wait in traffic late in the bend, tipped out a bit and split foes in upper stretch, briefly
raced on equal terms with the winner nearing midstretch then could not match strides. EMPIRE OF GOLD in the second group off the inside, three wide
turn, came five wide and between horses into the lane, challenged between the top two nearing the furlong grounds, could not keep up with that pair in the
run to the wire, determined to hold the show. STRIKE POWER broke sharp, set or forced the pace, battled upper stretch, weakened, outfinished for the
show late. MOJO MAN last away, trailed well back off the inside, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat. MR. JAGERMEISTER broke
with the field, prompted pace outside, vied three wide through the turn, four wide into the lane, gave way soon after. NO PAROLE early pace along the
inside, with the leaders through the turn, also backed up steadily through the stretch.

Footnotes
SUPER STOCK bumped lightly at the break, tracked the pace inside, inched closer in the two path through the second turn, roused for the drive, was
making minimal progress on the two leaders before switching to the outside past the furlong marker, finished with good resolve to be clearly best at the end.
CADDO RIVER broke inward but alertly lightly bumping with the winner, narrowly showed the way past the wire the first time, set a pressured and lively
pace along the inside, headed past the furlong marker, proved little match for the winner late, battled back to earn the place spot late. CONCERT TOUR
broke sharp, pressed the leader from the outside through those lively fractions, advanced and challenged far turn, dueled into the lane, narrowly showed the
way past the furlong maker, weakened late from between foes to lose the place in the waning strides. GET HER NUMBER last away, moved out to be four
wide midway on the first turn from the second flight, fell back, continued in the four path when trailing into the far turn, displayed a modest amount of late
interest to be gaining for the show spot. LAST SAMURAI in the second flight into the first turn when four wide, angled in to be three wide midway on that
bend, remained within striking in the three path into and through the final turn, had little left for the drive. HOZIER in the second group while between foes,
worked way to the rail in the second turn, faded through the stretch to trail home well beaten.

Footnotes
CONTINENTAL COINS moved outside in the first turn, stalked in the run up the backstretch, advanced on the leader from the outside while between horses
second turn, dueled to the wire closest to the inside, drifted in then out, fully extended to narrowly prevail. ANTIGRAVITY forwardly placed while .three wide,
ranged up in the three path and outside the winner to challenge in the second turn, dueled with that rival the length of the stretch, outkicked in the late going.
JUNESANDRA within striking distance just off the inside, two path final turn, went evenly through the stretch to finished well clear of the others, no match for
the top two. BAMALAMA in mid pack while four wide in the first turn, continued outside, four wide again in the second bend, continued to race one pace
through the stretch while also lacking a late kick. SAQEEL broke back, trailed well off the pace for a half, advanced far turn, some traffic five sixteenths out,
moved out, improved while finding best stride too late. NOMADIC FIGHTER void of speed, raced three wide, improved position in the drive without posing a
serious threat. HYPE MAN broke alertly, set the pace just off the inside, gave way when headed by the top two midway on the final turn. MISTER
SNICKERS lacked early foot off the inside, failed to rally. RESERVE in traffic into the first turn, mid pack for six furlongs, tired in the drive. ARDANWOOD
steadied past the wire the first time while in tight, mid pack toward the inside, moved out and closer three wide into the far turn, began to give way soon after
and continued to fade. TIME IS YOURS off slow, angled immediately to the inside, remained back toward the inside, never a threat.
