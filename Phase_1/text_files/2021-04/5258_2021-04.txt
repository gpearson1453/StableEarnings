ESKENDULCE with the second flight through the far turn, responded readily when set down, rallied four wide to make the lead before the furlong marker
and finished full of run to win going away. EIGHT AIN'T ENOUGH broke in front, set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch then was no match
for the winner. LAST DROP OF WINE prompted the pace two wide into the stretch then was outfinished. LEVANTO (ARG) went evenly. DISCLOSURE vied
for the lead along the inside into the stretch then faded. VAN DAMME reluctant to load, was no factor. ATTUCK had speed into the far turn then gave way.

and finished well clear for second. TIVIS was bumped at the start then rallied belatedly in the five path. TIZ INDEPENDENCE bobble outward at the start
bumping a rivals then went evenly along the inside. CEVICHE was bumped at the start and passed tiring rivals through the stretch. LETTERED OLIVE
pressed the pace two wide into the turn then gradually weakened. THREATLEVELMIDNITE (GB) failed to respond. SIERRA DIAMOND was restless in the

Footnotes
CANDY COMA chased the pace two then three ide through the turn and into the stretch, dug in determinedly through the final furlong in the four path and
drew clear. MIKE MIKE stalked the pace into the turn, slipped through to make the lead nearing the top of the stretch then couldn't handle the winner. SKY
MIKE unhurried early, had a mild rally late in the six path. LAS ANA away alertly, dropped back to trail soon after the start then found his best stride late in
the four path. PENTHOUSE KITTEN passed tiring rivals in the seven path. LONESOME PHIL never far back, moved closer along the inside into the stretch
then leveled off. PUTIN MY TWO CENTS made the lead soon after the start, set the pace through the turn then weakened. SHORTY had good early speed
then faded. COPPER GIDEON had brief speed. ARROGANT MAN was a forward factor into the turn then gave way.
