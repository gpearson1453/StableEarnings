Footnotes
GOLD NOTE tracked the leaders four wide, bid into the final turn to move clear through that bend and drew off under steady handling. RANCHO BARGO
made the pace racing about the three path to the far turn then could not go with the winner nearing the lane. SPUNKY KITTEN prompted the pace inside
rivals to the far turn and weakened into the lane. SUPERSERG followed the pace three to four wide and tired. DIRECT IMPACT was not a factor. LISBON
steadied in traffic on the first turn, chased three or four wide and tired. CLEAR THE NILE saved ground and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SHERWIN moved inside to bid nearing the lane, put a head in front turning for home and edged clear under steady handling. WICKED EMPIRE prompted
the pace four wide outside rivals and could not go with the winner in the drive. FORGERY was four wide on the turn, moved up but could not threaten the
top pair. HIWAY FIFTY NINE was on the lead between rivals and weakened into the lane. TOMBI was five wide on the turn, drifted nine wide into the lane
and could not threaten late. MAVALOUS MAVALOUS lacked a rally four wide. FLY DONNA FLY saved ground and was not a threat. KIDO'S SLING SHOT
chased the leaders four and five wide in the turn and weakened. PAPER ROSES was not a factor. BIG BEND BUCKAROO was slow into stride and trailed.

steady handling. A SHEEN CAT moved four wide to challenge outside MIDNIGHT LEWIS in late backstretch, edged clear turning for home then could not
go with the winner. MIDNIGHT LEWIS moved three wide to challenge late backstretch and weakened in the drive. PIT FIRE moved up four wide while not a
threat. PHILOSOPHER dueled on the early lead inside THE FRANCHISE and weakened in the far turn. UNCLE TAP moved up three to four wide while not
a threat. BIG BLUE OKIE was carried out at the break and was always back racing wide. LET IT RIP saved ground and was outrun. THE FRANCHISE
dueled early outside PHILOSOPHER and tired. HEROS DON'T DIE followed the pace three wide and gave way.

PHLASH DRIVE tracked the pace outside NAME THE PRICE throughout, wore that one down in the lane and edged clear late. NAME THE PRICE gained
position out from the rail to make all the running then could not handle the winner in the drive. SUPER CHARLIE moved up four wide with a mild bid into the
lane but could not close the gap late. JUDGE ON THE RUN stalked the leaders racing out from the rail and failed to rally. DEE'S LUCK chased the leaders
three or four wide and weakened. GO GOLD lacked a rally racing four or five wide. MORNING SHADOW tired from along the inside. L B GOLD tired racing

midpack and lacked a solid closing bid. CHUCKMATE saved ground and lacked a final closing bid. RAIN RAY failed to threaten from six wide into the lane.
