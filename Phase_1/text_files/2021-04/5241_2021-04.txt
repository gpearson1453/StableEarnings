Footnotes
SAMMIE SUNSHINE vied outside RAGTIME SUZY while confidently handled, moved away without much effort mid way on the turn, widened under a solid
drive in mid stretch, switched over to her left lead heading to the sixteenth pole then maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire. NANA'S SHOES
settled in the clear and off the inside, angled out mid turn, circled five wide while put to pressure into the lane and gave willing pursuit to be well clear of the
rest. WICKED SOLUTION stalked behind foes, raced in about the three path pursuing past the three sixteenths but went evenly late. RAPIDASHQUEEN ,
four wide and outside a rival early on, circled four wide chasing into the lane then faded through the final furlong. TWO CARAT saved ground off the pace,
was under a ride leaving the far turn but failed to respond. RAGTIME SUZY was sent up to the inside of the winner leaving the chute, contested the pace
into the far turn, failed to keep pace past the three eighths then dropped back.

Footnotes
BAPTIZE THE BOY was rated back off the pace after an alert beginning, raced three deep heading to the turn, came under a solid ride past the three
eighths, circled four wide while gaining momentum into the lane, kept on grinding while on his left lead, collared the leader past the sixteenth pole, sustained
and forged ahead in the final yards. BENANDJOE prompted the pace two wide, took over between rivals nearing the three eighths marker, handled outside
pressure nearing the lane, opened up under a drive leaving the three sixteenths, dug on when confronted past the sixteenth marker and continued valiantly
while just failing to last. TOY dropped off the early pace, came under a ride leaving the far turn, raced three wide into the stretch, shifted in past mid stretch
but could only muster up a mild kick. VALUED NOTION tracked outside, bid three deep leaving the far turn, forced the issue outside BENANDJOE past the
quarter pole, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. WICKED PRANKSTER saved ground, angled out in the drive but failed to menace. PADRINO'S
HEART broke a step slow, edged up between rivals early on chased around the turn then gave way. GREAT GO GO sped clear early, set the pace towards
the rail, was overtaken just before going a half mile, failed to keep up past the five sixteenths and faltered through the drive.

JOHN THE BEAR sprinted to the early lead, set the pace off the rail around the turn, was under pressure while steadily drifting out through the stretch.
GHIDORAH , off the rail in striking position around the turn, rallied inside the winner in a sharp effort. FORTH worked between horses on the turn and
passed tired ones. SOUPER FORTUNE , reluctant to load into the starting gate, bore out at the break, was outrun well off the rail and passed tired rivals
late. SOUPER EMPEROR bore in and bumped PHAROAH'S FURY when bearing in at the break, hugged the inner rail while stalking the pace and gave
way. RIPPOLINO , outrun, stumbled on the heels of a rival leaving the turn then swung to the six path in upper stretch. PLISSKEN raced along the inner rail
on the turn while outrun. PHAROAH'S FURY , bumped leaving the starting gate, chased the pace, drifted out leaving the turn, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
EARNED IT rated between rivals while in range past the three quarter pole, gave up some ground past the five eighths, was put to a ride inside horses
leaving the three eighths, eased out and worked his way between runners into the stretch, inherited a clean path as the embattled leaders wandered well off
the inside leaving mid stretch, took command under a drive past the sixteenth marker and kicked clear. BOZZINI lost ground four wide around the first turn,
continued well wide while pulling his way forward past the five eighths, dropped in a bit and shadowed the leader from his outside leaving the far turn,
dueled from the five sixteenths, was brushed out carried out by HE'S NOT CURLY in mid stretch and battled gamely to the line to earn the place. HE'S NOT
CURLY took over between foes nearing the first turn, cleared off and set the pace in about the two path, was joined by BOZZINI leaving the far turn, sparred
with that one past the three sixteenths, ducked out twice under left handed asking, corrected and gave way grudgingly. MONKEY'S MEDAL lagged off the
rail, came six wide for the drive and found his best too late. MARYLANDER broke a step slow, raced removed from the rail, came five into the lane, shifted
some and continued with interest. UHWARRIE SKY stalked three wide, came under a solid ride past the three eighths, pursued four wide outside runners
into the stretch, stayed in touch to about mid stretch then faded. IRISHTOWN tracked inside, was under a drive chasing past the five sixteenths, cut the
corner into the lane and weakened.

RATIFY bore out leaving the starting gate, found room along the inner rail to take command at the head of the stretch, drifted out in upper stretch and held
sway under urging. TIPYOURHATTOTHAT chased the pace three deep on the turn and finished gamely. REPLICANT bumped with SHANGHAIED
ASTORIA when that one was forced out soon after the break, raced behind horses on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and drifted in near
the eighth pole. SHANGHAIED ASTORIA bumped REPLICANT when forced out by the winner leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail around the
turn then altered course to the three path near the eighth pole. UNCLE JEROME , quickly clear, set the pace in the two path on the turn and tired in the
stretch. GOLDEN GALLANT was outrun.

Footnotes
SHANE'S JEWEL vied outside GOODLUCKCHUCK, moved clear three wide and in hand after a half mile, responded when roused with a turned down right
stick in upper stretch, drew off with alacrity in mid stretch and proved much the best while geared down nearing the wire. AUTOMATE , well placed in the
clear and in range of the dueling leaders, shifted out a bit for the drive and gave willing chase to the wire. ROUGH SEA lost ground four to five wide, was
under pressure while making a mild advance past the five sixteenths, straightened away but failed to seriously follow through. GOODLUCKCHUCK disputed
the pace to the inside of the winner, could not keep pace past the three eighths, chased into the lane then faded. WALK AWAY JOE saved ground off the
pace, eased out under pressure in mid stretch but lacked a solid finish. BEYOND THE VICTORY , taken to rate off the pace, was shaken up three to four
wide around the turn but failed to generate a response. EVEN THUNDER hopped at the break and was a bit rank, raced between runners leaving the far
turn then came up empty.

Footnotes
PORTAL ONE showed speed down the backstretch, hugged the inner rail on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, advanced between horses in mid stretch,
gained the lead near the sixteenth pole and edged clear. MOSLER SAFE chased the pace while three deep on the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch,
lugged in near the eighth pole and finished willingly. LADNEEDSAHANDLER stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, eased out to the four path
approaching the stretch, had aim on the lead in upper stretch and weakened the final furlong. BUZZHOUND raced along the inner rail throughout and
finished willingly. MR. MOSLEY angled to the three path leaving the turn, raced between horses and failed to menace in an even effort. INK bumped with
FRANCIS X. when forced in by DON'T DARE ME leaving the starting gate, floated to the five path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. DON'T DARE ME bore
in leaving the starting gate, rushed up outside horses to take the lead approaching the turn, remained in contention to upper stretch and tired late. FRANCIS
X. bumped at the start, was not a factor and angled to the four path between horses in upper stretch. FAX was outrun.
