KAELY'S SISTER set the pace from the outset with a little pressure, shook off that foe along the turn, was in the three path into the lane and widened down
the lane. POLISHED GEM tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run. UNUNDERSTANDABLE
broke through the gate in the pre-start, chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane with no gain in the stretch drive. MS V TIME was in the three
path into the lane and through after a half.

Footnotes
MUNNYFOR RO lied off of the pace in the two path around around the first turn, shifted to the three to four path around the far turn while advancing inside
of THIRD DRAFT, sustained a rally inside of that foe through the lane to bid for the lead passing the furlong grounds, and gamely fended off her outer
counterpart to the wire. THIRD DRAFT sat reserved far off of the pace in the two to three path around the first turn, got floated five wide around the far turn
while advancing outside of MUNNYFOR RO, sustained her bid through the lane to duel with that rival through the final furlong, but missed. PERHAPS
TONIGHT (IRE) got keen between horses through the stretch for the first time, settled in midpack two wide into the first turn, chased three wide around the
far turn, sustained a rally to bid for the lead at the furlong pole inside of a pair of outer surging foes, but was outkicked by them at the sixteenth marker.
SCARABEA trailed along the inside, shifted to the three to four path entering the lane, then stayed on for a minor share. NEVER CONTENT (IRE) stalked
two wide around the first turn, assumed an advantage at the five furlong pole, drew clear and held that margin around the far turn, but was headed at the
furlong pole, and weakened thereafter. SALIT stalked along the inside, but faltered between horses around the far turn. WOLFBANE lied forwardly placed
three wide, chased the clear leader around the far turn, but faded in upper stretch. ZURI set the pace along the inside around the first turn, but was headed
at the five furlong pole, faded into the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
MALPAIS prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, forged an advantage while shifting a few paths outwards in upper stretch with DON'T FORGET
in pursuit, then gamely held sway from that foe to the wire. DON'T FORGET trailed along the inside into the turn, rallied four wide turning for home,
sustained his charge under a long drive through the lane with a clear MALPAIS to catch, but did not have enough to catch him. LAND BATTLE was off a
step slow, lied off of the pace four wide, gained into the turn before shifting down three wide at the five sixteenths grounds, but was outkicked by DONT
FORGET in upper stretch while chasing the clear leader, then kept on to secure show. SAVAGE NATION set the pace, felt strong pressure from the
eventual winner around the turn, and yielded in upper stretch. JOYFUL HEART was off a step slowly, advanced to lie close up to the pace along the inside,
stalked around the turn before tipping two wide entering the lane, but lacked a kick to split horses in upper stretch, and failed to produce a bid. TESTY
KITTEN tracked from midpack two wide, but faded around the turn. AYE SKIPPER lied off of the pace three wide, but weakened into the turn, and was done
early.

POCKET SQUARE (GB) settled off of the pace two to three wide around the turns, swung five wide turning for home, rallied to sweep past the leaders
approaching the final sixteenth, and drove clear. TUNED (GB) saved ground while rating off of the pace, awaited racing room while shifting off of the rail
turning for home, altered course three wide passing the quarter pole to split foes at the three sixteenths marker, shifted inwards inside the furlong pole to
claim place after POCKET SQUARE (GB) kicked away, then fended off CHOATE BRIDGE to the wire for that position. CHOATE BRIDGE hopped a bit at
the start and trailed along the inside early on, took the far turn in the three path before swinging six wide in upper stretch, then rallied outside of foes through
the lane, but missed catching TUNED (GB) for place. MORE THAN UNUSUAL prompted the pace two wide, forged an advantage while being herded a few
paths outwards in upper stretch, but was outkicked by rivals on both sides at the sixteenth grounds. GAMBLIN TRAIN saved ground off of the pace, but
failed to threaten. FLABBERGASTED set the pace along the inside, drifted outwards while being headed in upper stretch, then weakened through the final
sixteenth. TIZAHRA stalked along the inside, chased the leaders while shifting off of the rail in upper stretch, but failed to produce a bid, and weakened
between horses before steadying mildly passing the furlong pole. BROADWAY LADY tracked from midpack while caught four wide around both turns, and
faded through the lane. MORE GOOD TIMES lied far off of the pace, got caught four wide around the far turn, shifted six wide entering the lane, but lacked
a rally. IN A HURRY was brushed by an outer foe at the start, lied forwardly placed two wide and between horses, but faded around the far turn. WALK IN
MARRAKESH (IRE) stalked three wide, but got keen into and around the first turn, then faded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
STAY HOME lied off of the pace along the inside, swung four wide turning for home to commence a rally, split the leaders at the furlong pole, and drove
clear. HIGH FIVE COTTON stalked along the inside, then two wide into the turn, tipped four wide turning for home to bid at the quarter pole, held an
advantage through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner foe passing the furlong pole, then just saved place on the wire. SEVENTY SEVENTYCAT
trailed, altered from the three to the five path in midstretch, surged through the late stages, but missed reaching place on the wire. CONGRATS THIS
tracked from midpack in the three to four path around the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, and stayed on for a minor share. DIDDLEY bumped with
an inner foe at the start, pressed the pace three wide, chased around the turn before vying between horses entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer
foe in upper stretch. RED BLUE AND TRUE dueled along the inside, allowed his outer counterpart to clear in to the turn, shifted three wide entering the
lane, but lack a kick to make a re-bid. LONG ON LUCK lied far off of the pace along the inside, split foes two wide in midstretch, and improved position.
DISTORTED RANSOM failed to factor. FEVOLA saved ground from midpack, but shifted three wide turning for home, and faded at the quarter pole.
STARSHIP MERCURY bumped with an outer foe at the start, lied off of the pace while caught in the five path around the turn, and caved though thelane.
IKE dueled two wide, cleared off into the turn, but was headed at the quarter pole, and weakened thereafter.
