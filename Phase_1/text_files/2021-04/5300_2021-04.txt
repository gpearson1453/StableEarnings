of the pack, moved up around the second turn, entered the stretch wide, drifted in bothering foes and gained ground late. LAST TO KNOW lacked early
speed, raced wide around the final turn, entered the stretch wide, was bumped down the lane and outfinished for third. EVERLOVINGHAND challenged for
the early advantage and weakened late. BIG MERRILL dueled on the front end in the early part and faded. PRINCE PERFECTA raced evenly near the
back, got in tight quarters down the home stretch and was no threat late. JUSTA SWINGING raced within contention and dropped back. MAS O MENOS
raced in the middle of the field, came around the first turn on the outside and retreated. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO THE RUNNING OF

POUND FOR POUND pressed the pace, moved up on the outside around the final turn, drove clear down the lane and finished well. JIMI'S A STAR raced
within contention, made a late gain, entered the home stretch wide and was a clear second. NATE'S ATTACK vied for the early advantage, saved ground
around the second turn, weakened and proved no match for the top two. MAGA MAN dueled for the early lead and lacked a finish. LIKEN IT bobbled at the
start, raced in the back and lacked a bid. FLYING HONEYPOT void of early speed, saved ground around the second turn, finished wide and was never a
threat.

SHACKS RIVER vied for the early lead, took command around the final turn, pulled away and proved the best. J Z'S FIRST raced near the back in the early
going, came around the first turn wide, made a steady gain and was a clear second at the wire. LIL HOT TODDY pressed the early pace, eased back,
moved up on the inside and was a clear third. RUNAWAY HENNY raced in the middle of the pack, had an outside trip and put forth an even effort. TIZINDY
QUEEN lacked early speed and was never a factor. CHIEF FALCON raced within contention and faded. SHOOTING STICK void of early speed, finished
wide and was never close. KELLYS THE BOSS dueled for the early lead, saved ground and dropped back.

TEMPRANO challenged on the front end, saved ground and drove clear down the home stretch. FLASH ME BACK pressed the pace, raced close
throughout, finished willingly and was a clear second. GOLDEN PALACE was an early factor, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the top two,
but was best of others. AZTEC DELITE vied for the early lead and weakened. U COMPLETE ME raced within contention, saved ground around the final
turn, weakened and finished evenly. AND YET ANOTHER raced near the back, had a wide trip and was never a factor. PERFECT PARADE lacked early
speed and was never close. KRISYNSARASBOY steadied early, drifted out around the first turn and was never a threat. DRY WOOD CREEK steadied
repeatedly in the early going, raced near the back and showed little.

DUEFORADATE stalked the leader in the early going, moved up around the final turn, took the lead, pulled away and proved the best. SILVER SIREN
unhurried in the beginning, moved up, four wide around the final turn, made a late gain, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. MI COPA
REBOSA lacked early speed, had a wide trip, gained ground and was just up for third. BECCA'S WHISPER broke poorly, racing in the rear, made a late
rally and just missed third. REALMENTE CALMADA lacked early speed, had a wide trip, made a bid and hung. MADISON'S PLACE challenged for the early
advantage and faded. THIS IS MY PRAYER raced in the middle of the field, made a bid and faded. ISLAND BLUE raced near the middle of the pack,
dropped back and was no threat late. SING THE SONG quickly went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and was done. DIXIELAND FLASH showed
brief speed and quickly dropped to the rear.

early part, raced outside around the turn, entered the stretch wide, made a mild bid, but was no factor. C C'S BABY GIRL pressed the early pace and
weakened. D'WILD BARONESS raced within striking distance, weakened, entered the stretch wide and was no threat. SHE WANTS HALF void of early
speed and was never close. KNIGHT'S HONOR raced within contention and dropped back.

Footnotes
MEDITATE pressed the pace, raced close throughout, made a late bid and drove clear. BIG BOY DAVE REX unhurried in the early part, raced outside
around the first turn, made a wide bid and was just up for second. GENTRIFIED raced near the back in the early going, moved up, made a stretch bid and
was outfinished for second. DICTATOR went to the front, drove clear and lacked a finish. RUN TAPPY raced in the back of the pack, saved ground around
the second turn, showed late interest, but was no factor. GREELEY'S DEALER raced within contention, saved ground around the final turn and faded.
SECULAR STAGNATION raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. UNWANTED INTRUDER raced in the middle of the field, faded and finished
evenly. MIDNIGHT REVOLT always raced near the back and showed little. JOHNNYSJOURNEY pressed the early pace and stopped.
