Footnotes
HE'S NO BULL broke alertly, prompted the pace while racing off the inside, crept closer on the outside and three wide into the turn, dueled in the two path
into the stretch, drew steadily clear in the run to the wire while being kept to task. TOUGH STUFF also away in good order, sprinted clear to show the way
up the backstretch and into the turn, raced on equal terms with the winner inside that into the stretch, proved no match through the lane, remained clear of
the others. EL VENUE asked along in a forward position early, remained in the second flight closest to the inside through the bend, set down for the drive,
slowly getting to the runner up late. CEEKY lacked early foot just off the inside, moved closer in some traffic late in the turn, continued to be covered up into
upper stretch, improved position when clear. WEAST HILL broke with leaders, moved out a bit to race three wide through the turn, continued one paced
through the stretch to finish up evenly. COLLEGE PARTY prompted the issue from the two between horses, also came up empty for the stretch run. ALL
SHACKED UP failed to menace with a four wide trip. IMPRESSIVE STUDENT off a step slow, moved up wo within striking distance turn then gave way
when the real running began at the head of the stretch. STRATE REMARK off a step slow, trailed while racing three wide.

Footnotes
PAPA STAR forwardly placed early along the inside, advanced, challenged along the rail midway on the turn, clear when straightened for home, enough left
to hold the runner up safe lte. TWISTED DIXIE lacked early foot, began to advance when dropped to the inside through the turn,swung out for wide into the
stretch, drifted in a bit, coming late to narrowly miss. STORM CLASSIC pressed the runner early from the outside, vied outside that one in the three path
through the turn, could not keep up in the drive, remained well clear of the others. ROLL DINERO ROLL broke best of all, set the pace in the two path,
contested the issue between horses late in the turn, weakened in the drive. HOLDING PATTERN bothered just after the start, went evenly while racing three
wide. DOUBLE BOGEY forwardly placed early from the outside, four wide into the turn, faded. GONNA GETCHA broke in, was straightened to race
forwardly up the backstretch while between horses, retreated. PUTTER bothered when put in tight at the start, raced back and three wide turn, failed to
meance. STRATICUS pinched, checked up at the break, trailed throughout toward the inside.

Footnotes
TORIN forwardly placed off the inside, chased the winner out of the turn and through upper stretch, roused, late surge to be up in the final strides while
between horses at the finish. GREATER CAIRO broke sharp, quickly sprinted clear, showed the way up the backstretch by daylight, still clear into the
stretch, nipped late. SHANGHAI'S DREAM chased the top two up the backstretch toward the inside, three wide into the lane, slowly gaining late while
widest of the first flight. DAY TRIP last to leave, lacked speed, two path exiting the turn, improved upper stretch, not a serious threat to the top three late.
CASCADE KING void of early foot, four wide out of the turn, made little impact in the drive. GAINER tired while racing three wide. I'M A SPECIAL STAR
raced in mid pack for a half, was finished by exiting the turn.

Footnotes
VERY SPICY forwardly placed from the start, ranged up outside the leader late in the turn, disposed of that rival past the furlong marker while drifting out,
steadily increased advantage to the wire under a firm right handed crop. ALLOFOURDREAMS away well, sprinted clear soon after, showed the way into
and through the turn in hand, dueled with the winner inside that one into the lane, proved no match the final furlong, clearly second best. ANGEL ARKIE
bumped, forced in at the start, last away, inside turn, traffic, steadied behind a rival into the stretch, recovered and improved position with a late run through
traffic. MARQUEE COWBOY settled off the pace, three wide through the turn, improved slightly. SKADI forward and three wide outside the winner into the
turn, worked way to the rail through the bend, moved out a bit for the drive, came up empty in finishing flatly. NATURAL JEWEL within striking distance
while racing outside, four wide into the turn, two path exiting, tired through the lane. ALITTLEBITOFSMARTY floated in at the start, settled in mid pack, went
evenly in lacking a closing response. CYBER AFFAIR broke back, failed to menace while racing three wide. MARILYN'S MAGIC broke in, was finished
early. MORO MAGIC forwardly placed in the early going off the inside, in some traffic into the turn, began a steady fade before three furlongs. CALICO
DREAMER was never involved in remaining always back.

Footnotes
OUTLIER off the pace and the inside, lodged a middle move three wide to challenge midway on the final turn, shook clear when straightened for home,
enough left to hold off the runner up safe late. LAUTREC in the second flight along the inside, rated the middle half while continuing to save some ground,
roused for the drive, late surge, missed. CONQUISTADOR SHOW settled off the early pace toward the inside, loomed a threat four wide turning for home,
flattened out in the drive. FUNANDFUNNY pressed the leader while under firm restraint off the inside, closer to challenge between rivals to briefly challenge
in the second turn, could not keep pace with the top two in the drive, comfortably well clear of the others. BIG BIZ saved ground to no avail. HARD TO
PARK within striking distance in the early going, had nothing for the drive. MAJOR KONG off a step slow, remained always back. SHAKE IT off slow,
sluggish, bothered by stricken foe into the first turn, remained far back. ASTROLOGER shortened stride soon after the start in distress, unseated rider into
the first turn, vanned off.

Footnotes
KASSERINE PASS in the second group just off the inside, moved to challenged in the two path and between foes turning for home, edged clear under
steady handling. PERFECT ICE STORM bump start, prompted the pace while racing three wide, challenged while continuing in the three path second turn,
dueled outside the winner into the lane, could not match that one late, held sway for the place. HELLO DARLING bumped at the start, void of speed off the
inside, tipped out four to five wide exiting the final turn, rallied on the outside and finished up willingly to be closing on the top two. LADY MCKENZIE broke
back, continued to lack speed the first six furlongs, three to four wide when beginning a modest advance late in the second turn, closest to the top two late,
outkicked for the show. BOATHOUSE VIEW settled off the pace and the inside, fanned six wide into the lane, lacked a closing punch. DESCENTE void of
speed while racing outside, five to six wide through the second bend, also came up empty for the drive. FLEETA BELLE set or forced the pace for over six
furlongs in the two path, gave way when headed by the top two turning for home. LAURIEANN set or forced the pace along the inside, backed up steadily
the final quarter. INDIAN BELLA four wide when prompting the pace in the first turn, continued outside, stopped while once again four wide in the far turn.

Footnotes
UNDECIDEDCERTAINTY broke well, took command immediately afterward, relaxed in the run through the turn, continued clear past the furlong marker,
held the next two safe late under steady handling. ETERNAL ENDEAVOUR (GB) off a step slow, raced back early, came three wide out of the turn, rallied
to chased the winner late, no gain on that one in the final strides while gaining the nod for the show. SKAMANIA prompted the issue three wide up the
backstretch, chased the winner into and through upper stretch off the inside, also could not make any inroads on that rival late, nipped for the place. MARY
ALICE raced in mid pack and outside early, four wide into the turn, displayed some mild interest to close the gap some on the top three at the wire.
RAGATAGTAG within striking distance while racing outside lacked a late punch. BIG TINY void of speed, angled out to be five wide turning for home,
displayed some modest late interest to improve position down the middle of the strip. STYLIN UPTOWN remained always back. FABULOUS GIRL within
striking distance outside, four wide turn, faded. BETWEEN THE HEDGES vied early along the inside, also began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
TEMPT FATE away well, got clear before a quarter, rated in the run up the backstretch through legitimate fractions, remained clear through the lane under
intermittent pressure to prove clearly best. MAN IN THE CAN moved up to race closest to the winner off the inside first turn, chased that one up the
backstretch under a slight hold, attempted to move on that one in the second turn, could make no further inroads, clearly second best. THE MARY ROSE
settled in mid pack off the inside, advanced three then four wide through the second turn, closest to the top two past midstretch, no late gain, best rest.
PROMISING SHOES last away, void of speed, improved in the two path out of the final turn, no threat to the top three. BANDIT POINT lacked speed off the
inside, advanced with a three wide move the third quarter, flattened out a bit the final furlong. IZA DADDY broke in, bumped CINNAMON VICTORY, was
straightened to race in mid pack and outside, four wide much of the way, finished up evenly in lacking a closing bid. IMPLICATOR saved ground when off
the pace in the first turn, moved out, raced four to five wide far turn, lacked a closing response. DESTINY WAY rank early when forwardly placed, raced
within striking distance in the two path, had little left for the drive. GLACKEN'S GHOST remained back while racing off the inside. C H JAY forwardly placed
in the early going, steadily faded. CINNAMON VICTORY bumped at the start, raced forwardly and outside, stopped, distanced after losing contact with the
field, jogged in.

Footnotes
HAPPYMAC broke sharp, quickly cleared toward the inside, larger lead turn, drew out stretch while being kept to task. CHURCH SERVICE in the second
flight while along the inside, chased that rival past the furlong marker, no match for that one, fully extended to preserve the place spot. STAR SAILOR in the
main body while outside, raced four wide throughout the turn, roused late turn, gaining for the place while remaining well out in the strip. WICKED MAD last
to leave, trailed early out in the strip, four to five wide late in the turn, displayed some late interest midtrack to improve position. MAXIM MOMENT in the
second flight off the inside, three wide through the turn, continued in even fashion through the lane in lacking a closing kick. HARD CASH broke back, saved
ground turn, improved position. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM lacked speed, fell back through the turn, passed some tiring rivals through the stretch while never a
serious factor. TIZ LIFE lacked speed three wide, dropped to the inside turn, passed tiring rivals. TALKTOEACHOTHER forwardly placed while three wide,
backed up. COAL TOWN ROAD in mid pack just off the inside, faded after three furlongs. DO RIGHT chased the winner early, began to back up after three
furlongs.
