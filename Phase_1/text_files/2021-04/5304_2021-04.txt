came in the two path for the drive, moved out a bit, closed steadily to be up in time. FIRESIDE KITTEN settled in the second flight while in the two path,
advanced and took over late in the final turn, showed the way until late, could not contain the winner while remaining clear for the place. VISUAL MAGIC

away, trailed early inside, moved out, came three wide into the lane, displayed a moderate amount of late interest to be gaining for the show. TAPALONG
dueled early along the inside, fell back after a quarter, continued to lost position backstretch, steered out to widest for the drive, evenly late. FIRST

Footnotes
ARLINGTON'S SHINE in the second group while racing off the inside, advanced while working way out to be four wide turning for home, put a head in front
when straightened for home and drove clear. CYBER SHOES off a step slow, raced back and inside through the first turn, continued to save some ground
into the second bend, steered out to be three wide midway on the final turn, moved to the inside a bit in some traffic entering the stretch, finished up willingly
to be clearly second best. RANDOM AFFAIR dueled up front while off the inside, slightly larger advantage before a half, came three wide when narrowly
show the way into the lane, offered brief resistance to the winner into the stretch then could not keep up nor was he able to contain the runner up, lasted for
the show. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY in mid pack back early while off the inside, asked along in the second turn, between rivals into the lane, finished up evenly.
RIANTE SKY off a step slow, moved out into the first turn, came four exiting the final turn, improved position slightly while not posing a serious threat.
SPIRIT SOUL settled off the pace while along the inside, moved closer in some traffic late in the final turn then flattened out in the drive. GENTLE KNIGHT
forwardly placed while .three wide the first turn, continued to race in a striking position the middle half, had little left for the drive. UNBRIDLED SHOES six
wide into the first turn when well off the pace, trailed after a half, moved inside, passed tiring rivals to improve position while not a serious threat. JESSE
JONES dueled up front along the inside first turn, prompted the issue inside the middle four furlongs then began to falter. CYBER FLAME fractious gate,
unprepared, off slowly, void of speed off the inside, three wide second turn, failed to menace. WILL RED four wide into the first turn, angled in a bit,
remained in mid pack up the backstretch, tired in the drive. MOON IN THE SKY finished early, stopped in the far turn, distanced after losing contact with the
field, walked off.

GAINER settled off the pace and the inside, called on for run second turn, advanced three wide, bid when straightened for home, bumped a furlong out,
edged clear late under continued steady handling. PAPA JIMMY forwardly placed toward the inside, moved closer then waited in traffic turning for home,
dropped inside, clear for the drive, proved game for the place. EPIC ADVENTURE prompted the pace in the two path, challenged in the second turn, drifted
out under a left handed stick to lightly bump the winner in midstretch, could not match strides with that one in the late going, outkicked in the waning strides
for the place. BEAUCETTE'S EKATI last away, four wide into the first turn, continued lack speed, off the inside second turn, improved position without
posing a serious threat in the drive. CHICAGO CHROME rank and slow to settle when showing the way first turn, clear in the run up the backstretch,
weakened when headed when entering the stretch. THAT DUDE settled off the pace and the inside, had little left for the drive. KING OF THE RING raced
outside and back off the pace, four wide through the second bend, came up empty for the stretch run. PONTI POKER void of speed, was never a threat.
SCYNTZ was finished after a half.

Footnotes
REASON TO SOAR in the second group while toward the inside early, closer late turn, angled out four wide turning for home, extended drive, fully extended
to hold the runner up at bay late. ALEXANDROS broke out, was straightened to race forwardly, closer three wide turn, lost some to the early leader into the
lane, rebid nearing the furlong marker, came back for the place late in a determined effort. P R RADIO STAR lacked speed while off the inside, came three
wide into the lane, rallied through traffic while altering course to be up late for the show. HIDDEN RULER void of speed while racing along the inside,
continued to save ground turn, improved past the furlong marker, nipped in the final strides for the show. UNDERCOVER LOVER in the second group while
outside the winner, floated out five wide by that one turning for home, lacked a closing kick. ACE DESTROYER broke alertly, cleared to the inside, showed
the way through the turn, headed nearing midstretch, weakened when headed the final furlong. HUBBADAHUBBADABOOM away in good order, pressed
the issue while between rivals in the turn, gave way in the drive.

BOO BE RIGHT broke sharp, soon sprinted well clear, continued to maintain a sizable advantage through the turn, not threatened through the stretch while
being kept to task. SMELLIN CANDY in the second flight while racing outside, continued to race out in the strip to be four wide through the turn, slowly
getting to the winner late, clearly second best. EAST MOON LAKE back off the pace, advanced in the two path into the stretch, closest to the top pair past
the furlong marker, could do little with that pair in the run to the wire, all out to hold the show late. DESTINEDTOBEASTAR last away, trailed while saving
ground into and through the turn, steered out a bit, improved position to. AFRICAN WARRIOR broke out and toward the back, lacked off the inside, came in
the two path for the drive, improved in upper stretch then flattened out in the final furlong. PRINCE LEO in the second flight while racing three wide, lacked a
closing kick in the drive. GOTTA LOVE IKE chased the winner for a half while toward the inside and gave way. CINCO CATALINA mid pack early, fell back
after a quarter, four out to five wide turn, failed to threaten. JIMMIE T finished after a half, trailed home.

Footnotes
SHEDIALED BURREAUX broke in good order, dueled into the turn off the inside, disposed of the other speed entering the stretch, drew out under her own
courage to win ridden out. LIL RESPECT in the second flight while racing in the two path, proved no match for the winner in the drive, held sway for the
second spot. DEDE'S TRICK in mid pack up the backstretch inside, continued to save ground turn, moved off the rail a bit for the drive, continued with a
mild rally to garner the show. AS REQUIRED in the second group while racing outside, continued three wide into the lane, went evenly to the wire in lacking
a closing punch. MISS ALLIE GRACE off a step slow, raced back, swung five wide into the lane, improved position while widest in the drive. WINNING
WALK void of speed, raced four wide through the turn, also bettered her position through the stretch while not posing a serious threat. UNHERDOF went
one paced while racing off the inside. ANOTHERINTHEFIRE settled in the two path off the inside, came up empty drive. ILEAVETHELIGHTON bothered, off
slow, failed to menace while four wide most of the way. LITTLE SURE SHOT dueled up front inside the winner for a half then gave way in the drive. I PICK
PHOEBE bothered at the start, remained always back. SUPER CASSIDY broke out, bothered a couple of outer foes, raced toward the front in the run up
the backstretch, was finished aby early in the turn.

Footnotes
CASCADE KING back off the pace while racing toward the inside, steered out three wide and between horses into the lane, rallied well out in the strip to be
up in time. KHAKI JACK broke alertly, cleared to the inside in showing the way up the backstretch, dueled through much of the turn, disposed of that rival
when straightened for home to be clear again by the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, held the place late. SMACK ATTACK behind the leaders
while racing off the inside, angled out to be four wide into the lane, up late for the show. HANEY BOYS away in good order, pressed the runner up into the
turn off the inside, moved up to duel with that one through the bend, could not keep up in the drive, caught late for the show. SPECIAL PRYCE within
striking distance while along the inside, came in the two path for the drive, came up empty for the stretch run. JACK LUVS NOVA off a step slow to trail
early, inside then to the two path late through the turn, no real threat. PERVASIVE remained always back while racing toward the inside. HARRY broke in
then steadied soon after, mid pack off rail, fanned five wide into the lane, lacked a closing response. HAMMERSCHMIDT was finished early.

Footnotes
PLAINSMAN forwardly placed while four wide through the first turn, continued in a striking position on the outside in the run up the backstretch, four down to
three wide through the second bend, dueled past the furlong marker, wore that rival down under steady but confident handling. MY SIXTH SENSE closest to
the leader in the two path, advanced on that one and took over in the final turn, dueled with the winner inside that one through upper stretch, gave ground
grudgingly in the final furlong, clearly second best. CHRIS AND DAVE forwardly placed off the inside, stalked three wide the middle half mile, lacked a
significant closing response to finish up evenly. ARRIVAL settled behind the leaders along the inside, also came up evenly for the stretch run. GATO
GUAPO broke with the leaders, got clear in the first turn along the inside, showed the way up the backstretch, gave way when headed in the far turn.
UNDERPRESSURE last away, fell further and further back the opening half, was never involved in a dull effort.

Footnotes
LUCKY EVERY DAY broke alertly, cleared toward the inside soon after, maintained a comfortable advantage throughout while being kept to task.
TAILORBESWIFT bumped at the start, chased the winner throughout, set down for the drive while off the inside, proved no match for that one, remained
clear for the place. AUNT SUNSHINE broke back, was bumped by FIVE RIVERS when that one came out early, clipped heels in some traffic soon after,
raced back, encountered traffic when beginning to advance late in the turn, rallied for the show when clear for the drive. FAST SOPHIA pulled early when in
some traffic, shifted out a bit then was off the inside through the turn, went evenly in the drive to be caught for the show after lugging in midstretch. WARM
BEAUTY broke in, raced in mid pack while racing outside, three wide through most of the turn, four wide into the lane, went one paced to the wire. LADY
PRIEST in tight to be off slowly, raced back, four out to five turning for home, improved position while not a serious threat. LIL' FANCY settled off the pace
after moving off the inside, three wide into the lane, tired in the drive. GET ONE MORE saved ground to no avail. DENA'S BOLD MOVE raced in mid pack
early, faded. GOLD N SEXY bumped at the break, raced forwardly and in the two path, began a steady retreat before a half. FIVE RIVERS broke back,
trailed throughout while racing five wide.
