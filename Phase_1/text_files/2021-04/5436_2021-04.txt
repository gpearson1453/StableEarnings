Footnotes
LITTLE CAN went to the front, took command, pulled away and proved much the best. CRUSADER EXPRESS raced within contention, moved up on inside
around the turn, angled out, entered the stretch four wide, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE lacked early
speed, entered the stretch five wide, made a mild bid and proved no match for the top two. COAST GUARDSMAN pressed the early pace, came around the
turn three wide and lacked a finish. CAJUN BERTI broke thru the gates before the start, flashed early speed and faded. PERFECT PERIGEE void of early
speed and was never a threat. STONE DREAMER always raced near the back and was outrun.

COOL INDIVIDUAL unhurried in the early going, made a steady gain, rallied four wide down the lane and got up in time. GO FOR MOONSHINE pressed
the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled with IMDUSTY down the home stretch and was caught late by COOL INDIVIDUAL, who came charging on
the outside. IMDUSTY was an early factor, raced close throughout, dueled down the stretch and was outfinished by the top two. ICE CRUSH lacked early
speed, gained ground late, while racing wide. TAKEN BACK raced near the back, came around the final turn wide, moved up, but was no threat. OUR
BERMUDA raced outside around the first turn, moved up within striking distance and weakened. EASTSIDE BOY void of early speed, raced wide around
the second turn and passed tired ones. SUPER FACTOR challenged for the early lead, briefly took the advantage around the final turn and dropped back
down the stretch. HE'S AN HONEST MAN dueled on the front end and was finished early. TENSAS TALK raced in the middle of the field, came around the
first turn on the outside, faded and was no threat late.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN DUDETTE went to the front, drove clear around the turn, was all out and held on for the win. MONEY INTHE STARRS challenged for the early
lead, eased off the front end, saved ground around the turn, angled out, rallied and was getting to the winner. POOPSIE DOOPSIE within contention,
forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late finish. MISS GURETTA raced near the back, had a wide trip, showed late interest, but was no factor.
CHARZEE BABY pressed the early pace, faded and was no threat late. THAT'S A SONG raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the
outside and retreated. REALMENTE CALMADA void of early speed and was never close.

Footnotes
PALACE WIND raced within contention, came around the turn on the outside and drove clear before the wire. THUNK raced in the middle of the pack, made
a late bid, four wide and finished willingly. FLASHBURN pressed the pace, took the advantage, lacked a late kick and was outfinished by the top two. RARE
STRAIN bumped at the start, racing near the back, made a late gain, but was no factor. JOE DIVER raced within contention, came around the turn wide,
weakened and finished evenly. BIG BAND'S LUCK sprinted to the front, drove clear and faded. RONNIE'S REASONING raced near the middle of the field,
put forth an even effort and was never a threat. BLAZING CHARLIE bumped both sides at the start, raced in the back and was never a factor. HARD TWIST
broke out, bumped rival, raced in the rear and showed little.

Footnotes
DUEFORADATE dueled for the early advantage, drove clear around the turn, was all out and held off a late running MISS OCEAN EXPRESS for the win.
MISS OCEAN EXPRESS unhurried in the early part, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a late rally and needed more ground. CATCAKE raced
within striking distance, saved ground around the turn and followed the top two down the stretch. LADY RAD lacked early speed, showed late interest, but
was no factor. MEMORY MAGIC challenged for the early lead and faded. HERO OF GOLD raced within contention, faded and finished evenly near the
back. HANDSOME GIRL void of early speed and was never close. GALAXY THIRTYSIX vied for the early lead, raced three wide around the turn and
dropped back.

Footnotes
UNDENIABLY DEVINE pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn, pulled away and proved much the best. SILVER MAID broke out, raced near the
middle of the field, finished willingly, but was no match for the winner. CRAPAUD raced within striking distance, came around the turn wide, made a late bid
and got up for show. HERE COMES LINDA lacked early speed, made a wide late gain, but was no real factor. KIMMY raced in the middle of the pack,
saved ground around the turn and put forth an even effort. EXECUTIVE COUNCIL raced within contention, saved ground around the turn and weakened.
MAGIC APRIORITY quickly went to the front, drove clear and tired. SEEKING THE STARS raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. B G'S
DREAMCATCHER pressed the early pace and dropped back. LAUREL'S CRICKET lacked early speed and showed little. STORM CAT'S CRY always
raced near the back and was outrun.
