Footnotes
GHAZAALY stalked AMERICAN LAW after being guided outside of that foe into the first turn, approached that rival's throatlatch at the six furlong pole,
dueled with that rival around the far turn, forged an advantage in upper stretch, and edged clear through the final furlong. AMERICAN LAW set the pace
along the inside around the first turn, met GHAZAALY's bid at the three furlong pole, dueled inside of that rival around the far turn, dug in gamely after being
headed in upper stretch, but was second best. FULL CHARGE saved ground off of the pace, chased the dueling leaders around the far turn after claiming
show, then held that position while failing to threaten. BENNYFROMTHEBRONX lied at the rear of the field two wide, drifted in under right handed pressure
before drifting back out under left handed pressure in upper stretch, then shied outwards again from left handed urging in the late stages, and failed to
mount a rally. BIGGIE stalked three wide, but faded at the half mile pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
BOURBON THUNDER stalked along the inside, patiently bided his time behind the leaders turning for home, altered course four wide approaching the
furlong marker, brushed PERFECT CUT in the process, then surged late to drive past the leaders approaching the wire. A C EXPRESSWAY dueled for the
lead two wide, got headed by the rallying C F V RED NOVA in upper stretch, kept on between horses to rebid for the lead inside the final sixteenth as that
foe tired, but was outkicked by BOURBON THUNDER late. C F V RED NOVA was off awkwardly, rallied from off of the pace four wide around the turn,
circled the field to forge an advantage in upper stretch, but tired late, and gave way between horses approaching the wire. MAHOMES MONEY dueled for
the lead along the inside, dug in while being headed in upper stretch, but gave way through the final furlong. PERFECT CUT chased three wide, came
under a drive at the five sixteenths grounds to produce a bid between horses, but failed to do so, weakened in upper stretch, and faltered further after being
brushed approaching the furlong pole. BIG IN THE CITY tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, but weakened into the turn and was done
early. TWO PRINCES was outrun.

Footnotes
SHADOW MATTER set the pace inside of foes while a path off of the rail, drew clear in midstretch, then just held from the rallying REWARD NIGHT at the
wire. REWARD NIGHT saved ground while tracking from midpack, tipped outside of the leading trio in midstretch, surged in the late stages to produce a bid
approaching the wire, but missed. K C ROCKET vied for the lead two wide, got kept in the three path around the turn by his inner counterpart, but was
turned way by that foe in upper stretch, and chased him home. GUN LAP lied close up in the two path early on, stalked along the inside around the turn,
attempted a rail bid in upper stretch, but leveled off. RECIDIVIST pressed the pace three wide while kept in the four path around the turn, and weakened in
upper stretch. KING'S MISCHIEF tracked from midpack in the three to four path around the turn, and failed to factor. PRIMARY ENDPOINT was void of
early speed, lied far off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and never got involved. PRIEST was outrun. UNEMBELLISHED was off slowly and was
slow into stride, got rank while pulling between horses and far off of the pace, then weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
EMPRESS ELEANOR trailed early on, took the far turn in the four path before swinging seven wide into the lane, rallied widest of all in pursuit of
ENJOYITHWHILEWECAN through the final furlong, then reached that foe at the wire to dead heat for the win. ENJOYITWHILEWECAN lied far off of the
pace three to two wide around the first turn, gained five to six wide around the far turn, rallied to sweep past the leaders at the furlong pole, drew clear, met
EMPRESS ELEANOR's bid approaching the wire, and held on via a dead heat. WE THE CLOUDS tracked forwardly placed four wide around the first turn,
three wide around the far turn before being floated back four wide entering the lane, chased through upper stretch before being outkicked by outer rivals at
the furlong grounds, then gamely held show from an inner rival to the wire. SECRET TIME (GER) saved ground far off of the pace, hugged the rail turning
for home, produced a mild rail rally inside of rivals through the lane, and missed reaching show. URBAN FAIRYTALE pressed the pace two wide, but was
outkicked by outer foes at the furlong pole, then kept on for a minor show. HAT TIP saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the two path entering the lane,
where she met a wall of traffic behind the leading group, failed to get through before being stymied behind a tiring foe at the furlong pole, altered course,
then stayed on. MORAL REASONING lied off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, chased from between horses, but
steadied in tight quarters at the furlong grounds. VIVIDLY (GB) stalked along the inside, chased through upper stretch, then faded. FRITZI tracked from
midpack in the three path, but failed to get involved. EMILY'S OASIS lied forwardly paced two wide and between horses, but got rank into the far turn, and
faltered. OSAKA GIRL set the pace along the inside, inched clear entering the lane, but was swallowed up between horses inside the furlong grounds.
TOOTSIE lied far off of the pace in the three to four paths around the turns, came into the lane five wide, and faded.

Footnotes
JOE FRAZIER vied two wide, cleared off at the half mile pole, dug in inside of WARRANT entering the lane, inched clear of that foe at the furlong pole,
shifted outwards a bit to meet that rival's rebid, and just held. WARRANT stalked three wide, pressed JOE FRAZIER from the outside around the turn, bid
entering the lane sparking a duel, drifted outwards at the furlong grounds allowing that foe to scoot away, kept on under a long drive to produce a late rebid,
but missed. ONE FAST CAT saved ground off of the pace, split foes two wide turning for home before shifting outside of the dueling leaders in upper
stretch, then chased those foes home while narrowing the gap, but did not have enough to catch them. MEDICINE TAIL lied off of the pace in the three path
around the turn, then chased the leaders home from along the inside. MANITOWISH set the pace along the inside, but failed to keep pace with JOE
FRAZIER into the turn, bore out around the bend to come into the lane in the four path while sustaining chasing position, then faded while continuing drift.
SANTA CRUISER lied at the rear of the field three wide around the turn, then split foes in midstretch to improve position. DEMOCRACY tracked from
midpack four wide while set up outside of foes, but got caught five wide around the turn, and faded through the lane. NOTABLE EXCEPTION tracked from
midpack two wide and between horses, took the turn four wide, and weakened. FOUNDER failed to factor. PALIO stalked along the inside, but failed to bid
before fading. SURLY FURIOUS was never involved.

Footnotes
JOUSTER established a loose advantage into the backstretch, rated along with that clear lead into the far turn, maintained that margin around the far turn,
widened when let out a notch in upper stretch, felt a shoulder tap at the furlong pole to keep to her task, and held safely to the wire under intermediate hand
urging. GIFT LIST (GB) tracked from midpack two wide, claimed place in upper stretch with a clear JOUSTER to catch, then chased that rival home while
grinding away at her advantage and fending off PLUM ALI for place. PLUM ALI broke inwards and bumped a foe at the start, saved ground from midpack,
shifted three wide entering the lane, then stayed on well with good energy. SARANYA stalked two wide, then from along the inside around the far turn, and
weakened in upper stretch. FLOWN bobbled then was bumped by an outer foe into an inner foe at the start, trailed along the inside, saved ground, but failed
to factor. SPANISH LOVEAFFAIR was bumped by an outer foe and steadied hard soon after the start, lied at the rear of the field two wide, shifted four wide
into the lane, but lacked a rally.
