Footnotes
COASTLINE SERMON rushed up inside to join a group of four going to the first turn, showed in front and set the pace under pressure throughout, held well
in the lane and kept KAT DUDE at bay to the wire. KAT DUDE was in the lead group four wide, dropped back a bit into the far turn then rallied four wide to
bid nearing the lane and could not get by the winner. LUCK CHECK forced the pace three wide outside the winner and weakened into the lane. POVERTY
FLATS was with the lead group into the first turn, settled inside nearing the backstretch then weakened in the far turn. PRAISE BE TO GOD saved ground
and was not a factor. SAY WHEN hesitated at the break to come away last, trailed and was not hard used in the lane to finish far back.

LIGHT BOUND BID stalked the pace four wide to bid through the second turn, continued outside rivals to the far turn, dug in as CHUCKMATE bid into the
lane and rallied back to narrowly edge that foe on the wire. CHUCKMATE stalked the pace from along the inside through the opening half, moved out four
wide heading up the backstretch, through the far turn to show in front turning for home then just failed to hold off the winner in the lane. TWO PAIR settled
off the pace three wide, made a mild move through the far turn then could not go with the top pair while clear for the show. DREAM BABY DREAM moved to
the front racing out from the rail, continued on the lead to the far turn and came up empty nearing the lane. GOLDEN BULLET was not a factor racing
outside. STICKINWITHTHEGUYS failed to mount a bid racing four wide. WAR EAGLE'S RETURN prompted the pace from between rivals to the far turn
and weakened.

PLATTE GIRL inherited a long early lead due to an incident leaving the gate, set her own pace a long lead out from the rail then was lightly roused through
the lane to hold safe. PRICELESS MIRACLE chased the winner from about the four path, moved inside that one into the lane and slowly closed. BULLS
EYE BETTY bumped hard at the break in a chain reaction collision at the break, saved ground and closed mildly late. STREAKNSILVERSTONE failed to
mount a solid rally four wide. MISS JUSTICE was bumped hard at the break, saved ground and could not threaten late. TEA AT NOON broke in the air then
was slammed hard into her outside rivals at the break and trailed. BEE MERRY veered out and slammed into rivals at the break, unseating her rider, then
went riderless around the track without incident. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the break and found no cause for action.

place. PRUD AS PUNCH moved up four wide but could not threaten late. SYDNEY ELIZABETH was three wide and lacked a solid closing bid. EVADE was
not a factor. SUDDEN LIGHT was always back. REFEREE chased the winner early from along the inside and tired.

AMARIN tucked inside early, rallied along the rail through the far turn to bid into the lane and edged clear under steady handling. BUTYOUCALLEDME
saved ground in reach of the leaders, angled out through traffic midway of the far turn to bid four wide into the lane and continued on to gain the place.
DONNAS FINAL WORD contested the pace three and four wide to bring a short lead into the lane and came up empty. VIOLENT FIT was five wide in the
first turn, moved four wide in the far turn and gained position but could not threaten. IMPASSION moved four wide and lacked a solid closing bid. DIXIE CAT
tracked the pace four wide to bid into the far turn then could not sustain the run in the drive. MS COMEDY TIME tucked inside going to the first turn and
failed to mount a rally. AWESOME PEGASUS showed early speed out from the rail and tired. DECADENT DIAMOND was five to seven wide through the
first turn and was always back. TSURUOKA chased the early pace three to four wide and tired.

Footnotes
FANTASTRY (BRZ) sprinted off to a long early lead racing about the three or four path, carried the long lead into the lane then was slowing up late but had
plenty left to hold safe. A SHEEN CAT chased the winner while saving ground and closed the gap late but could not reach that one. UNCLE TAP saved
ground back off the pace and moved up to gain the show while not a threat. LET IT RIP saved ground and was outfinished for position late. FORGERY
chased the pace three wide and had no closing run. ROLLIN RIVER saved ground and improved position only. HEROS DON'T DIE was three to four wide
and not a factor. SUPER MOTION was always back four wide. THE FRANCHISE chased the pace four wide and gave way.
