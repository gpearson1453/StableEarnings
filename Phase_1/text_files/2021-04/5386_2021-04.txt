Footnotes
KITTYHAWK LASS rated outside the pacesetter, drew alongside around the far turn, headed rival with a quarter mile left, took over in upper stretch, drifted
in a bit and gamely prevailed. ARCTIC ROLL (GB) stalked on the inside, tipped out into the stretch, drifted in and bumped rival at the eighth pole, continued
to drift in and took the path of MISS FLAWLESS, finished well inside the winner but could not get by. CLEARLY GONE stumbled leaving the gate, was rank
into and around the first turn, settled on the backstretch, came out on the final turn, entered the stretch five wide and summoned a mild late bid. MISS
FLAWLESS (FR) was squeezed and checked between rivals early, waited for room around the last turn, saved ground into the stretch, went between foes
and got bumped at the eighth pole then checked off the heels of ARCTIC ROLL soon after and finished willingly in the final sixteenth. LITTLE BIRD (IRE)
chased between foes then outside a rival on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, lacked the needed late kick and was not persevered with late.
LADY ROBIN set the pace from inside, tested around the far turn, lost command in upper stretch, got bumped and steadied near the eighth pole and
weakened. QUINNIE chased the speed three deep, dropped back and came two wide in to the stretch and had little left. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED ARCTIC ROLL FROM SECOND TO FOURTH FOR DRITING IN AND TAKING THE PATH OF MISS FLAWLESS PAST THE
EIGHTH POLE, COSTING HER A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
SCARY FAST SMILE set the pace inside of STING LIKE A BEE then cleared rival near the half-mile pole, showed the way along the fence into the turn,
challenged by THRIVE on the turn, asked at the quarter pole and turned away the runner-up into the stretch, then drew off under left-handed urging and
steady handling. THRIVE came in at the start, trailed early then moved up outside rivals, bid alongside the leader around the turn, lost contact into the
stretch, chased the widening winner through the final furlong and was clearly second best. CATFISH CHARLIE well placed behind the leader early, could
not keep up around the bend, drifted out into the drive and tired. STING LIKE A BEE away quickset from outside, pressed the leader then chased off the rail,
entered the turn between rivals, started to weaken around the bend and faded.

ANOTHER EDDIE angled to the inside while stalking the pace, angled to the two path around the bend and loomed leaving the bend, came out some in
upper stretch, challenged from outside and bested the runner-up late. DYLANS WILD CAT vied for the lead between foes then dueled with MUCHA
WOMAN, cleared that rival approaching the five-sixteenths, met the challenge from and ANOTHER EDDIE in the final furlong, fought back from inside but
yielded grudgingly in the end. MUCHA WOMAN vied for the lead with a pair of rivals then dueled with DYLANS WILD CAT, chased that foe a bit off the rail
into the drive and kept on to regain the show. MICHALSKA chased off the rail to the stretch and got edged for the show. BIG STRETCH traveled along the
inside, advanced while angling out on the turn, was in a bit tight between foes into the lane then again in upper stretch, angled out with a furlong to go and
finished evenly. STARLIGHT STROLL sat off the pace off the rail, moved into the two path then to the rail around the bend and lacked further response.
SUPER GAME tracked from outside, went four wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and never threatened. WESTWARD BREEZE reserved early,
settled outside a rival at the back, angled in and saved ground on the turn and proved no menace. STARSHIP DEFIANT vied three deep early then chased
the top pair into the turn, steadied between foes at the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
BLACK STORM unhurried in the beginning, angled out leaving the turn and entered the stretch three to four wide, closed from outside while drifting inward
through the stretch and got up late. BIG BAD GARY trailed the field early, angled in and saved ground on the turn, rallied up the fence and edged REEDLEY
for the place. REEDLEY vied for the lead from inside, fought with AN OCALA TEN around the turn, cleared at the top of the stretch, drifted off the rail and
could not fend off the top pair. AN OCALA TEN broke through the gate prior to the start, vied for the lead between rivals then dueled or pressed SORRISO
around the turn, failed to match strides at the top of the lane and got outkicked in the late stages. FACTS MATTER stalked three wide into the turn, came
four to five into the stretch and lacked a rally. SORRISO vied three deep early, chased the top pair on the turn and drifted out leaving the bend, then tired in
the drive.

Footnotes
CONSTITUTIONAFFAIR had speed outside ITSTHATTIME into the first turn, pulled to the front around the bend and cleared inside rival, showed the way
along the inside into the stretch, led to deep stretch and lasted at the wire. LIAR LIAR (IRE) in range early from inside, coaxed around the far turn, tipped out
in upper stretch, put in a late bid and missed. SEA OF LIBERTY saved ground through both turns, moved off the inside in the stretch, gained ground in the
late stages but needed to find more. STORM THE BASTILLE (FR) bobbled at the start, tracked in the two path then entered the stretch three wide and
finished evenly. GOV FROM ABOVE angled out entering the first turn, went three wide around that bend, exited the far turn four wide and weakened.
UNILATERAL lagged behind early, saved ground into the drive and was never a factor. ITSTHATTIME sped to the front and moved to the inside, lost
command around the clubhouse turn and chased the leader into the backstretch, traveled two wide into the far turn, steadied briefly between rivals at the
quarter pole and faded.

Footnotes
COWBOYS DAUGHTER stumbled in a quick beginning, took control early, set the pace inside, coaxed approaching the quarter pole, urged left-handed in
the drive and drew off. LUCKY LONG LEGS settled off the pace, crept closer up the backstretch, loomed from outside at the five-sixteenths but flattened out
in the final furlong and stayed on to hold second. INFO'S TREASURE trailed early from inside, came off the rail and showed a mild late response to get up
for the show honors. OUR BONNIE LASS went three wide around the first turn, three then two wide around the second bend, could not find the needed
response and was nailed for third. SECRET SQUARE broke out at the start, went four wide through the clubhouse turn, entered the far turn four wide then
came three wide into the stretch and could not rally. TIPPY TOP was rated early outside the pacesetter, dropped back around the far turn, eased in the late
and pulled up just before the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
FRATELLI sped to the front and steered over to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch and drew away in the late stages. JOHNNY PODRES stalked from
inside, waited for room behind the leader through the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, could not make cut into the margin in final furlong but was clearly
second best. LUVLUV chased between foes then three to four wide into the drive, summoned a mild rally and bested the rest. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK
tracked the leader outside rivals, entered the stretch four to five wide and improved position late. FIRST PREZ up close outside the leader early, chased
between rivals around the bend and lacked a serious bid. PERFECTIONISTIC chased outside rivals or off the rail, traveled four deep through the turn and
weakened. RACETRACKERS tracked in the two path then angled to the rail on the turn, angled out in the stretch and failed to make an impact. ALPINE
THUNDER was off slow to begin, chased three wide into the turn, angled into the two path then angled back out nearing the stretch and could not rally.
HAMMERING LEMON chased three deep on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
ALICE MARBLE forwardly placed in the early going, saved ground around the bend, tipped out in the stretch, closed from outside and got up in time. DELTA
WIND vied for the lead from inside, shook free around the turn, inched away in the lane but got caught in the closing moments. OMG IT'S JESSICA vied
between foes for the lead early, dueled into the turn, chased the leader two wide to the stretch, flattened in the drive but was able to hold the show. FI FI
PHAROAH stumbled at the start, tracked outside a rival well off the inside, entered the turn five wide, angled in around the bend and entered the stretch two
wide and lacked the needed rally. PISTACHIO PRINCESS saved ground along the inside and never rallied. PERFECTLY JULIE vied for the lead from
outside early, dropped back around the turn and faded. MISS O'BRIEN chased four wide through the turn and weakened. JEANNE B was taken well off the
rail early, went five wide around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
FOR THE GOOD TIMES reserved in the early going, went between rivals at the seven-sixteenths, came three wide into the lane, drew alongside the leader
with a furlong to go and drove clear. ROYALLY COMMAND pressed from outside early, chased the leader past the halfway point, re-bid a quarter mile out,
took over at the top of the stretch but got outkicked by the winner in the late stages. HYLAND HAVEN settled off the pace, steadied behind a rival past the
three-eighths pole, angled inside that rival then steered back out leaving the turn, finished well in the final furlong to prove a game third. SHOUT IT OUT got
bumped by GOLDEN JOURNEY then pulled early from inside, tracked along the rail, chased within range in the two path upper stretch but could not find the
needed late kick. GOLDEN JOURNEY drifted in and bumped SHOUT IT OUT and pulled into and around the first turn, chased between rivals then outside a
foe on the far turn, entered the lane in the two path and flattened out. SWEET MEG went four then three wide around the clubhouse turn, tracked three
deep up the backstretch, traveled three wide into and around the far turn and weakened. METAPHAR came away to a slow beginning, saved ground then
came off the rail in upper stretch and made no impact. AGATA set the pace from inside, cleared after four furlongs, tested at the quarter pole, lost command
at the top of the stretch and faded.
