Footnotes
LUCKY STREAK sent clear set a pressured pace dueling on the inside through the stretch finding more gamely. UPGRADE AL hustled on the outside
chased to upper stretch vying willingly to wire at mid track. ARMADA pressed in bid on the turn dueling abreast in upper stretch coming up a bit short in the
three path. TEAM LEYENDECKER a step slow early lost ground to upper stretch gaining some late six wide. COMMANDER CHACHI chased on the insidie
to upper stretch weakening along the rail. CHOCOLATE PHILLING played no factor. COUNT BRIAN was never involved. NOT QUITE WRIGHT offered
little. FOREIGN flashed early speed then gave way on the turn.
