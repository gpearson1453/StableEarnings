Footnotes
ST MARIA unhurried in the early part, while racing on the rail, moved up around the second turn, angled out and pulled away down the stretch. PINTLALA
raced within striking distance, came around the first turn wide, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. OVERLY SWEET
void of early speed, made a late gain and proved no match for the top two. CABEZA DE TORTUGA showed early speed, took command, drove clear and
faded on the inside. WE CAN DREAM lacked early speed and passed tired ones. SPANISH EXCHANGE dueled on the front end and was finished early.
STONE CLASSIC pressed the early pace and dropped back.

Footnotes
HOTMOLLY reserved in the early going, steadied down the backside, getting in tight quarters on the rail, found room, rushed up, took the lead around the
final turn and pulled clear down the lane. SINCERITY fractious gate, pressed pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but got up
for place. SHE'S MY PRIORITY went to the front, drove clear, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for second. GRAND ISLE GIRL pressed the
early pace, eased back, saved ground around the second turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. UGOTTAGO raced in the middle of the pack, came
around the first turn on the outside, saved ground around the final turn and put forth an even effort. AMERICAN MOM lacked early speed, moved up and
faded, while finishing wide. GATOR PROUD always raced near the back and showed little. GRACE FOREVER lacked early speed, had an outside trip and
showed little.

SOPHIE'S PRAYER vied for the early lead, drove clear around the final turn, drifted out down the home stretch, lost the lead, came back and got up in time.
ALHAMBRA PALACE pressed the pace, made a bid, took the advantage down the final stretch, but got caught late for the win. AKIANE'S SOLDIER raced
in the middle of the field, came around the final turn on the outside and was a clear third at the wire. SHO NUFF broke through the gates before the start,
showed early speed and faded. BLUE RIDGE QUEEN raced near the back, was never a factor, while putting forth an even effort. PLATINUM QUEEN raced
near the back, blew the first turn and was never close. SANDRA'S JUEL hesitated, hopped start, pressed the early pace and dropped back. MEAN
AMERICAN lacked early speed, blew the first turn and was no threat.

BEST LITTLE MAN vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the home stretch and prevailed for the win. CROQUE
MONSIEUR (GB) challenged for the early lead, saved ground, dueled late, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. MUFFIN NUTS lacked
early speed, had a wide trip, made a late gain and was a clear third. BRITTS A CLOSER pressed the pace, saved ground around the second turn,
weakened and finished evenly. KURTS RAIDER showed early speed, faded and went to the wire evenly. HEZA PRIORITY pressed the pace, faded and
was no threat late. MUSCADINE void of early speed, had a wide trip and was never close. DANCE KINGDOM raced in the middle of the pack and was
finished early. FREDONIAN had an awkward start, left at post and was never a threat.

FIRE BLASTER vied for the early lead, took command, drove clear and won under urging. SONOMA CRUSH challenged for the early advantage, forwardly
placed throughout, couldn't match strides late, but was a clear second. ONEHOLYLION raced within contention, saved ground around the turn, proved no
match for the top two, but held on for third. STEPPIN' OUTONHER lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. MY BUDDY CHUCK
bumped at the start, raced within striking distance and finished evenly. MEDAL OF COURAGE raced near the middle of the pack, came around the turn
wide and lacked a bid. STORMATION bumped at the start, pressed the early pace and faded. MY PAL TORRES broke out, raced near the back, made a
mild gain and was finished early. BERKO stumbled at the start and was never close. Due to a timer malfunction the half mile time was omitted.
