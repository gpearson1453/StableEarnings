Footnotes
GOLDEN VICTORY bobbled and brushed with rival at the start, tracked clear leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered
stretch in the three path, responded to urging and unleashed a strong late surge in the final yards to nail foe at the wire. LOVE AND HOLD cleared rivals
quickly on the backstretch, entered turn clear, entered stretch off the rail in the two path, clear with a sixteenth to go, and nailed t the wire by closing outside
rival. IMPEACHMENT ACE stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and into the stretch three wide, kept to task in the lane
and got up for third. BEST DANCE brushed with rival at the start, saved ground while tracking clear leader on the backstretch, continued along the rail on
the turn, angled to the three path in upper stretch and kept to task while being edged out for show. WHERES MY COOKIES saved ground throughout and
made mild bid along the rail in the stretch and just missed show. ENTREZ NOUS settled off the pace and well off the rail on the backstretch, continued wide
on the turn and proved no factor. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION, RACE WAS HAND TIMED
