Footnotes
ARCHIE CAN'T SELL set the pace while in the two path into the turn, was put under pressure entering the lane, dueled with rival inside the eighth pole while
exchanging brushes then edged clear late. HAPPY CAMPER was void of early speed while in the two then the three path through the turn, came into the
lane from the six path and gaining momentum, continued with good energy inside the eighth pull and was full of run the final seventy yards to be even for
the place spot. STOKED stalked the winner through the turn, moved to pressed that one into the lane, was inching up inside the eighth pole, brushed with
that one nearing the sixteenth pole and in deep stretch and could not gain further. SUGGESTED was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane
from the five path and finished evenly. JUSTOURLUCK chased the pace from near the inside through the turn, came off the inside into the lane and
weakened. TOE TAPPIN LUKE was never a factor while saving ground.

Footnotes
ITASCA vied from the inside of two others through mid-turn, continued under pressure into the lane, inched to the front and was joined soon after
straightening by another, lost the lead to that one near the eighth pole then stayed on well to regain the lead inside the sixteenth pole and was going away
at the wire. BOO REID chased a three rival duel through mid-turn continued three wide into the lane when gaining momentum, caught the leader and took a
short lead, looked to be a winner inside the eighth pole then faltered late. FINAL DELIVERY pressed the pace from between rivals through the turn, could
not keep up with the top two but kept on to stay clear of the next rival at the wire. MACHO MADNESS was never a factor while in the two to the four path
through the turn. COMMISSARIO was close early from the inside then steadily faded. NOT NOW RAND pressed then stalked the winner three wide through
late turn then faded once entering the lane.

MISS OVER THERE gained the lead at once, raced on a clear advantage into the turn, continued to slowly widen the advantage through the turn and into
the lane, quickly increased the advantage once straightened in the lane then was kept to the task to the end. SHOWSTOMPER was in the three path
through the turn and into the lane, moved past another to get nearest the winner, was no match for that one and finished well clear of the next rival. XINGFU
chased the winner from the two path through the turn, lacked a closing bid and settled for the distant third. HENRYS GIRL was fractious in the gate, reared
and unseated her rider prior to the start, chased the winner from the inside and through the turn then was empty entering the lane. TOLERATION was
always last while near the inside.

Footnotes
CABOT TRAIL pressed the pace three wide into the turn, moved to the front under minimal urging in late turn, was well clear entering the lane then widened
while being ridden out. UNCLE GREGORY was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path, angled to the inside
after the sixteenth pole and was just up for the place spot. COURT AND SPARK trailed through the turn and into the lane, swung into the six path for the
drive and was finishing with good energy from mid-track and was outfinished for the place spot. PASSAGEWAY raced in the four path through the turn and
into the lane, came into the lane with aim on the winner then flattened out inside the sixteenth pole and lost place and show. GREENSPAN was never a
factor while in the two path through the turn. ZIPAWAY vied for the early lead while two wide, continued to chase the leader through the turn and was empty
turning into the lane. DECEITFUL ANTHONY led before the first call, vied for the lead into the turn then steadily gave way.

Footnotes
CHAKRA raced in the four path through the turn when never far back, bid three wide near the quarter pole, gained a short lead after straightening in the lane
then prevailed after an extended drive. SHORT SUMMER DRESS pressed the pace from between rivals into the lane, dueled with the winner through the
final eighth and could not get by while settling for second best. CLEAR STEPS vied for the lead along the inside through the turn and into the lane then
could not keep up. JERSEY LILLIE was never a threat while racing near the inside. GIFT WRAPPED never was a serious factor while in the two path
through the turn. REAL BELLA was in the five path through the turn and was done near the quarter pole.

foes, then couldn't hold off the winner. NEXT TIME YOU WIN pressed the pace in the three path, then was no match in the stretch. YOGURT was through
early inside. MY GIRL LEXI was not a factor. SHADES OF TRUTH vied inside to the turn, then gave way.

Footnotes
HAZEL RAH chased the pace from the three path through the turn, angled into the five or six path into the lane, continued with good energy to collar the
leader in the last seventy yards and edged up. BLIGHT close up early, shuffled when others rushed up, continued in the two path into the lane, splitting
rivals late and got up for the place spot. CATCH THE SPARROW raced in the four path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, gained the lead near
the eighth pole then could not hold the top two safe. MACHO ALEGRE set the pace along the inside into the lane then gave way. TIP UP TOWN was never
a serious threat while in the three path through the turn and into the lane. SHIPSHAPE never was a serious menace while saving ground.
LONGLIVEJUSTICE was put in tight nearing the turn and was taken up, raced near the inside through the turn and moved up. RILEY RICH pressed the
pace from the three path and two wide into the turn, continued a serious threat into the lane then was empty. GOT LOST was checked between rivals near
the half-mile pole when trying to get position, lost ground through the turn and was done. PUNCTUATION was outrun while in the two path through the turn.
CHECKWITHTHEDEVIL dwelt at the start and spotted the field at least twenty lengths, continued to race while far back while never in it. VICTOR'S
MAJESTY was wide through the turn and into the lane and never a factor.
