Footnotes
OUR LITTLE DEVIL set the pace along the rail and widened while ridden out. FAST CATALINA slammed into the starting gate to get away a clear last,
made progress down the backstretch, was bottled up in traffic two wide around the turn, split rivals three wide near the quarter pole and finished willingly.
MS HEADLEY stumbled at the start, made a strong three wide move between foes around the turn then flattened out in the lane. HENNI PENNY went
evenly inside. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT failed to menace while racing three and four wide. SOOTHING was outrun inside. MY LITTLE ROSE had brief speed
four wide. HAPPY LOUDON pressed the winner two wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
SASSY BEAST dueled outside INCLUDE THE BEAST through the opening half-mile, faced an additional challenge as HEART OF GOD ranged up to her
outside turning for home, battled between those two through the furlong grounds while tardy changing leads, drifted out under left-hand pressure bumping
and herding out HEART OF GOLD late, and prevailed narrowly. HEART OF GOD was forced in by ROMANTICAL NOTE after the break, hustled through
early to get the garden spot off the dueling leaders, tipped outside them with a bid at the top of the stretch, fought shoulder to shoulder outside SASSY
BEAT into the final furlong, was bumped and herded out by the latter with 70 yards to go and could not get past. INCLUDE THE BEAST dueled inside
SASSY BEAST from the outset, weakened inside the top two leaving the eighth-pole, and stayed well clear of the remainder. ELLIEREESEASTON was
slow out of the gate, then was forced in due to outside pressure a stride or two later, and never reached contention. ROMANTICAL NOTE came in after the
start forcing foes inward, but was otherwise not a factor. HIDDEN DREAMS tired after a half-mile. ROADHOUSE BLUES raced two to three wide and was
finished early. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY, SASSY BEAST WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST POSITION AND PLACED SECOND FOR
IMPEDING HEART OF GOD IN DEEP STRETCH.

Footnotes
EAMONN settled in range inside, angled four wide near the quarter pole, surged to the front leaving the eighth pole and drew off while ridden out.
NACOZARI set a clear pace inside, turned back some challenges nearing the lane, re-cleared in upper stretch, switched back to the left lead leaving the
eighth pole, was no match for the winner from there but held well for the place. THE BEST DISTANCE stalked the pace two wide, bid nearing the lane but
was one-paced in the stretch. KICK IN THE GAS raced and three wide in midpack and lacked the needed rally. MERZAZ steadied at the start, was getting
out throughout, made a middle move outside nearing the far turn, got out about six wide under right-handed urging around that bend and was empty in the
lane. MUTARAAFEQ saved ground off the pace, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. PALEMMA was outrun inside. POLITICAL RIOT
was in range three wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole and tired in the drive. HIGHER LAW was off slow and never a factor while racing two
wide. FOG BOUND trailed.

BAILEY broke in bumping AWESOME BEACH solidly, advanced three wide on the turn getting closest to ENSIGN PARKER, rallied steadily outside that
rival through the lane and took over a sixteenth out. FLAMINGO HAWK lost ground as a fast second quarter unfolded, moved out four wide approaching the
stretch, and finished well to go clear for the place. ENSIGN PARKER dueled early outside FLORALA AL, drew well clear around the turn through a sharp
half-mile, began to labor with a furlong remaining and yielded inside the top two. FLORALA AL contested the early pace inside ENSIGN PARKER, could not
keep up on the turn and faded steadily. H P BIG HOPE bumped solidly with AWESOME BEACH at the start, and was outrun. AWESOME BEACH got
slammed between BAILEY and H P BIG HOPE and steadied back at the start, moved up inside after a quarter-mile, but had nothing left after that.

TWELVE VOLT MAN settled off the early pace three wide, angled five wide near the three-eighths pole, closed determinedly outside and was up on the
wire. MEETMEINKINGSTON was in tight at the start, advanced four wide around the turn, reached even terms near the quarter pole, dueled outside of
rivals through upper stretch then between rivals late and just missed in a game try. CAJUN MOON clipped NUZHAT'S heels early, quickly recovered to duel
three wide, fought on between rivals through the lane but was outfinished. NUZHAT was fractious in the post parade, broke sharply, had her heels clipped
after clearing, dueled inside of foes to midstretch and weakened. GIGANTIC broke inwardly, chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid. HIERRO
was outrun in the three path. SUCCESSFUL ONE dueled between foes early and tired in the drive.

LITTLE BIT GOOD saved ground unhurried early, took closer order around the far turn four wide, rallied steadily and was up outside KITTEN'S ROMANCE
in time. KITTEN'S ROMANCE moved inside on the first turn, edged closer to the front flight after a half-mile still inside, shifted three wide coming to the top
of the stretch, rallied to overtake CENTSLESS DRAMA with a sixteenth to go staying on her left lead all the while, and could not withstand the top one.
CENTSLESS DRAMA sprinted to the early lead inside, cut an even pace to the stretch, and weakened leaving the eighth-pole. R CALLI KIM steadied on the
fence inside KITTEN'S ROMANCE approaching the first turn, remained on the rail to the stretch toward the back, moved to the far outside past the
eighth-pole and was going well at the finish. REAL DOOZIE chased after the leader in the three-path around the first turn, was roused to challenge a
quarter-mile out, but could not sustain the bid by midstretch. TWIRLING STAR moved up three wide after a half-mile, but had nothing left approaching the
stretch.

TIDAL FORCES prompted the pace two wide, took the lead in midstretch, edged clear of the pacesetter, lugged in twice under right-handed urging and just
lasted. PRAYER BOOK stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide near the quarter pole, rallied outside and just missed. RABDAN set the pace along

around the turn, loomed large outside the leaders in upper stretch but flattened out staying on his left lead. INGREIDO raced four wide in range for six
furlongs, and gave way. RED FOG saved ground to no avail. TONS OF GOLD stumbled at the start and was outrun early inside, shifted out five wide on the
turn and made no headway. MEMORABLE bumped with NINETYDAYSOFWINTER at the start, vied inside MIDNIGHT WHISKEY to the turn, got
overhauled after six furlongs and retreated. MIDNIGHT WHISKEY vied for command outside MEMORABLE early, and was finished before reaching the

Footnotes
VOODOO ZIP disputed the pace in the three path around the first turn, took command near the three-eighths pole, drew clear soon after, angled in nearing
the lane and held clear under a drive. SMALL TALK stalked the pace two wide, angled in nearing the lane and finished willingly to be clearly second best.
HE'SPUREGOLD went evenly while racing two and three wide. COUNTERSTRIKE tracked the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. JET SPEED
saved ground off the pace, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. JERRY'S TURN chased the pace inside and faded. KEYBOARD
WARRIOR broke a step slow and was outrun while racing two and three wide. KAKE'SCHARMINGBOY dueled inside of the winner, tired around the far turn
and steadied near the quarter pole. RIDE THE CURL played no factor while racing three wide.

OUR FANTASY dueled outside SUBSIDIARY early, drew clear around the turn, moved to the rail in upper stretch and stayed in command under a drive.
DON'T GET KHOZY broke slowly, advanced after six furlongs while shifting out four wide, and rallied steadily outside to get the place. SUBSIDIARY dueled
inside OUR FANTASY for a half-mile, could not keep pace with that rival on the turn, moved off the rail for the drive and was outfinished for second.
PUPPET MASTER raced three to four wide, dropped back approaching the stretch, then kept on well enough for the last major share. GLOBAL AMBITION
raced two to three wide, and was finished after six furlongs. JUDY'S WAY stumbled at the start, stayed close to the turn, and gave way. ADDILYN broke
awkwardly and showed little.

Footnotes
TWENTY FOUR SEVEN settled off the pace along the inside, circled four wide around the far turn, assumed command leaving the eighth pole and held
sway under a drive. AMBASSADOR JIM trailed inside for a half, made progress at the rail rounding the far turn, waited briefly for room in upper stretch then
rallied strongly between foes. FACE OF VICTORY set the early pace in the three path, vied two wide around the far turn, led to the eighth pole and lost
second late. FARLEY stalked the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was one-paced. DOVER CLIFFS saved ground in range, went
two wide around the far turn and finished evenly. TUSK was never threat while racing three wide. ZIPPY played no factor while racing two wide early and
four wide around the far turn. UNCLE CURLY vied inside and retreated nearing the lane.
