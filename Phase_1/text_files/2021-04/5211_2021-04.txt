NORWEGIAN set a pressured early pace, went five wide into the turn, took control in the stretch, drifted out late and held. BLUE CHIP BETTY tracked the
early pace, raced seven wide through the turn, angled in late, offered a mild rally and finished second best. BLACKBERRY LISA was outrun early, advanced
eight wide out of the turn and was closing late. JADEY AT THE BAR was unhurried early, angled out nine wide into the turn and was gaining late. STEVE'S
BABE DOLL stalked the early pace, raced along the inside into the turn, angled out six wide out of the turn, angled in late and was empty. SINCERE
WARNING pressed the early pace, went three wide into the turn and faded. WRIGHT WINGED was allowed to settled early and gave way.
TILLTHELUVRUNSOUT was void of speed and was no factor.

VROYSKY set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turns, opened up in the drive, drifted out late and held. ADDISON BOOM was taken back
early, raced along the inside into the home turn, checked off heels, angled out, found room between rivals out of the turn and was gaining late. IRISH
CHARLIE was unhurried, saved ground into the home turn and was along for third. CAPTAIN RED raced in mid pack early, angled out five wide out of the
second turn and was empty late. MONTANA JACK pressed the early pace, raced three wide into the second turn and weakened. YHA YHA was allowed to
settle early, went four wide into the second turn and finished belatedly. WILL YA WIN SUM was void of any early speed, angled out six wide into the stretch
and flattened out. OFFICER OF WAR was reserved early and was no factor.

Footnotes
THORN HILL CAT was allowed to settle early, saved ground into the home turn, angled out six wide out of the turn, was gaining late, took control late and
edged clear. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM tracked the early pace, went five wide into the second turn, was no match late and finished second best. LIFELINE
set a pressured early pace, raced three wide into both turns and weakened late stretch. SURPRSINGLYPERFECT raced in mid pack early, raced along the
inside and flattened out. MAMBOCELLO pressed the early pace, went four wide into the second turn and faded. TEDDY TIME was void of any early speed,
angled in and offered no late rally. DAWOOD was outrun early, went six wide into the second turn and never fired. MONUMENTAL SEVEN was taken back
early, raced between rivals and was no threat.
