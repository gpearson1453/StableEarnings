turn, made a bid, took the lead and was outfinished, while putting forth a game effort. MISS MABELEE raced in the back of the pack in the beginning and
passed tired ones. THIRSTYPROSPECT raced in the middle of the field, lacked a bid, while putting forth an even effort. BIND ME UP raced within

CRY LIKE A BABY pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and drove clear late. CHEROKEE BLESS lacked early speed, made a steady gain, split
rivals down the stretch, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. SHE'S THE BOSS challenged for the early lead, raced close throughout and
was outfinished for place. RHETT'S RACER showed early speed, raced wide around the turn and was close throughout. SAY YES AGAIN dueled for the
early lead, took command and weakened. FILM STUDY raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. ROSE CROWN raced within striking
distance, saved ground around the turn and lacked a bid. WILL B LATE stumbled at the break, raced near the back and was never a factor. MALARTACH
void of early speed, finished wide and showed little. CAN'T COUNT THAT always raced near the back and was outrun. WRINKLED ROSE lacked early
speed and never mounted a bid. MISS DAWN raced in the middle of the pack in the early going and dropped back.
