Footnotes
PICADILLY ROADSTER tracked the early leaders three and four wide, moved with the winner into the far turn bid, lost some ground nearing the lane then
rallied back in the drive to surge clear. AMERIPOINT settled back off the pace3 four wide, rallied into the far turn to move clear nearing the lane then could
not hold off the winner late. CASH MONEY tucked inside just off the early leaders, remained just off the leaders in good position but could not produce the
needed late effort. BEAR TRAPPE settled back off the pace two or three wide and moved up in the lane but lacked a solid closing bid. HYPER DRIVE was
on the pace from along the inside, was caught in tight into the far turn and checked then weakened in the drive. DOMINANTE was three or four wide off the
early pace and lacked a rally. BIG HEARTED FACTOR was on the pace inside HYPER DRIVE, was caught in tight entering the far turn and checked then
dropped back. The riders of both HYPER DRIVE and BIG HEARTED FACTOR lodged claim of foul against the top two finishers alleging interference into
the far turn which was not allowed.

BULLS EYE BETTY prompted the pace three or four wide outside rivals then could not go with the winner in the drive. RUN BRINLEE RUN was on the pace
inside rivals to the far turn and weakened nearing the lane. ORFELINA was in reach four or five wide and lacked a final closing bid. WILDFIRE SIS saved
ground and had no rally. SMILIN JOSIE saved ground and never threatened. CRAZY COYOTE settled off the pace three wide and failed to offer a bid.
LOTS OF SHADE was with the pace between rivals and tired. JUST SEND HER raced wide and was always back.

TOP STAR moved up outside PAYSTER to challenge in late backstretch, continued outside that one through the bend into the lane and edged away late
under steady handling. PAYSTER sped to a clear early lead racing out from the rail, was joined by the winner going to the far turn and dueled through that
bend then could not match strides in the lane. BRAVO KOLT hesitated at the break, chased the top pair from three or four wide and could not close the gap
in the lane. OUR HALF FIRST was not a factor. SUPER MOTION veered out at the break and trailed.

Footnotes
UPPERCLASSMAN moved clear before going a quarter from three wide, carried the lead into the lane then held safe late as PAPA CABALLERO closed
deep stretch. PAPA CABALLERO was caught a bit tight between rivals racing onto the main track, chased the winner and rallied late to close the gap. The
rider of PAPA CABALLERO lodged a claim of foul against the winner alleging interference entering the main track which was not allowed. D' KINGFISH
rallied three wide into the lane and closed some late. HARDWORKCLEANLIVIN was in reach three or four wide but could not produce the needed late run.
IPIDATE saved ground and closed some ground late. BARRY LEE was three or four wide in the turn, swung wide into the lane and moved up. CALL A COP
was four and five wide in the turn and lacked a rally. MICKEY THE MOOCHER showed some early foot along the inside and weakened. SPUR was not a
factor. IN CONTROL was widest throughout and weakened.

Footnotes
RULETHENIGHT moved three wide to bid into the far turn, vied between rivals through that bend and the lane, dug in late and found a late surge to put a
nose in front on the line. I CALL SHOTGUN was three wide to challenge inside rivals going to the far turn, dueled through that bend into the lane and was
outnodded for the winner. EIGHTS WILD moved up four wide to bid into the far turn, dueled outside rivals into the lane land narrowly missed late. COUNT N
GOLD was angled out to move three and four wide in the far turn then could not reach the top ones late. WAR EAGLE'S RETURN was caught in tight and
shuffled back into the first turn in traffic, moved up three wide and made a mild late gain. PENCE was four and five wide through the first turn and lacked a
solid closing bid. VISCOSITY failed to mount a bid three wide. DA VAN GEAUX saved ground and was not a threat. BRETT'S BOY followed the pace three
or four wide and weakened. FERRARI ROAD moved to the front and gained the inside through the first turn but tired after a half.

SILVER MAKER dropped back off the early pace, rallied four and five wide going to the far turn to bid and move clear nearing the lane then widened under
steady handling. KAT DUDE was on the pace racing out from the rail and inside READY OR NOT, could not go with the winner in the lane and saved the
place late. SONGSTER stalked the leaders three wide, moved up and gained the show through the lane. POVERTY FLATS was along the inside, angled
three wide in the far turn and moved up through the lane. SUPERSERG saved ground in reach of the leaders and weakened. READY OR NOT forced the
pace outside KAT DUDE to the far turn and weakened in the drive. OFFICER SID was not a threat and fanned seven wide into the lane. MASTERPIECE
DAY moved up three wide to bid in late backstretch and could not sustain the move. IN THE GAME tired racing three or four wide.

Footnotes
RUNAROUNDDANCING was in reach of the leaders three wide, angled four wide into the lane and surged late to collar WITT'SDOLLARNIGHT in the
closing jump. WITT'SDOLLARNIGHT angled out going up the backstretch to join the leaders going to the far turn, led through deep stretch and just failed to
last. HOLIDAY JOKE was back early four wide, angled widest into the lane and rallied but could not threaten the top pair. TRUE WEST moved up outside,
went five wide in the far turn and lacked a final closing bid. GIANT GAMBLE moved to the front racing out from the rail, was pressed throughout while
leading to upper stretch and had little left. COWBOY DON moved up three wide while not a threat. YODELERS WAY prompted the pace three or four wide
and weakened. OVERANALYZER saved ground and failed to mount a bid. R DUB was four and five wide just off the early pace and weakened. HORSE
FLY was always back.

Footnotes
MOST AMUSING prompted the pace outside EPIC DRAMA to bid clear through the far turn then widened under steady handling. NEWS BOX rallied four
wide in the far turn to have aim at the winner turning for home but could not sustain the move. PODEROSO EQUS saved ground and moved up through the
lane to but could not threaten the top pair. SWINGIN' SAM stalked the pace two or three wide in good position but weakened in the lane. EPIC DRAMA
showed the most early speed to gain position out from the rail, made the running to the far turn and came up empty in the drive. I'M RIVER saved ground
just off the leaders and weakened. FENDER BENDER was just off the pace three or four wide and weakened. DRIBBLES lacked a rally three or four wide.
SENOR BLAIR weakened racing three wide. TOUCHING RAINBOWS bobbled at the break, was finished before going a half and eased across the line.

Footnotes
WHATA PERFECT DAY settled off the early pace three or four wide, launched his rally heading up the backstretch to challenge through the far turn, bid into
the lane and went determinedly to keep AUCTIONEER safe. AUCTIONEER made the pace on a short lead out from the rail, kicked clear through the
second turn, carried the lead to late in the far turn, dug in when challenged but could not keep the winner safe. LIL SILVER FOX was unhurried early four
wide, rallied through the far turn to come five wide into the lane and gained the show late. ALEUTIAN HARBOUR tracked the pace three wide to bid into the
lane but weakened late. ARCH SEEKER moved four wide but could not threaten late. FLANAGAN failed to mount a bid three wide. WINTERS RUN
prompted the pace along the inside and weakened. DRAX lunged at the break and was always back. RAHAAL was just off the early pace three or four wide
and tired. ARCH'S WILD tucked inside early to stalk the pace and tired.
