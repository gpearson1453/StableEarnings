MEMPHIS DOLL tracked the early pace, went four wide into the second turn, drifted in and held for third. TIZ DONNA BELLA was up close early, raced
between rivals into the home turn and weakened. ROSIES BABY was allowed to settle early, went six wide out of the second turn and offered no rally.
COCO LOCO MAMA stumbled slightly at the start, stalked the early pace from the inside and retreated. REAL GOOD DEAL was void of speed, went three
wide into the second turn and was no factor. DELIGHTFUL HIPS set a clear early pace, went three wide into both turns and faded.
