Footnotes
ELECTRIC YOUTH got bumped between foes who each broke her way and was squeezed back at the start and taken hold of conceding four lengths to the
front before settling into stride, chased four wide coming under light coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command near the eighth pole and edged clear under a drive to prevail. ROAD TO REMEMBER three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. STEPPIN' HAWK six then five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the three-sixteenths, got collared just outside the eighth pole, then
weakened in the late stages. PAPI'S BABY GIRL broke in at the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and
weakened. VIVAZANO broke out at the start bumping and squeezing back ELECTRIC YOUTH in concert with DOM'S FEISTY GIRL, who broke inwards,
chased four to five wide until tucked inside at the half mile pole, swung four wide for home and made no impact. MISSPOTOFGOLD coaxed from the gate,
showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home under threat, got collared at the
three-sixteenths and folded. DOM'S FEISTY GIRL broke in at the start bumping and squeezing back ELECTRIC YOUTH in tandem with VIVAZANO,
chased three wide coaxed along from midway on the turn, faded and went three wide into upper stretch, tired and was eased through to the finish.

hand three wide through the bend taking command nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, drew off under a
drive getting geared down in the late stages to the finish. GHOST STALKER shied in at the start filling the space left vacated by the aforementioned foe,
chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home getting up to secure
the place honors. BELLAMY DOLCE bumped at the start by SCOTTY, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, bid five to six wide
into upper stretch, kept on to procure the show honors. OHYOUDIDNTKNOW three to four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled six
wide into upper stretch and offered no response. BOWING SNOWMAN advanced after the start to range up inside and take command six furlongs from

turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. SCOTTY broke out a step at the start bumping
BELLAMY DOLCE, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went three wide for home and trailed throughout.

MR PHIL chased inside until tipped out to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, advanced three wide through the turn getting on near even terms at the
three-eighths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive getting shaken off a bit a furlong out, closed in to
take command seventy yards from home and inched away to the finish to prevail. THE RIGHT PATH broke in at the start bumping BIG BOY MO solidly into
MO GOTCHA, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five wide
into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the place honors. NOT PHAR NOW established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, had
the eventual winner advance through the turn and knocked heads with that foe coming under coaxing just inside the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
for home, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was collared seventy yards from home when weakening in the late stages.
MO GOTCHA got bumped solidly askew at the start when THE RIGHT PATH broke inwards bumping BIG BOY MO into him, conceded only two lengths
when briefly put to hustling, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered no rally. BIG BOY
MO got bumped solidly at the start by THE RIGHT PATH, who broke inwards, and in turn bumped MO GOTCHA in the hindquarters conceding four lengths
to the front before settling into stride, chased three then two wide under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and offered no
response. NOT THAT BRADY hustled from the gate, chased four then five wide, went six wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest to be along second best. SHARP STARR five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed
along midway on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. GONE GLIMMERING showed the way in hand three paths off the inside while

front inside that station, went three wide for home and tired. INVALUABLE four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled five to six
wide into upper stretch and tired.
