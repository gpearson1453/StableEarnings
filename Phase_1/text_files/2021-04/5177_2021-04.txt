Footnotes
ALMONASTER broke readily while shifting inwards at the start, was urged to dictate the pace a bit off the rail racing into the turn, then held sway to the end
while being kept to firm encouragement to maintain a safe margin. D TACHYON, urged to a forward placing tracking the pacesetter three wide, continued in
pursuit of that foe into upper stretch but proved only second best. CHRISTMAS PRESENT settled out of close quarters in the opening stages while angling
to the inside, advanced to contention along the rail leaving the turn but lacked the needed final bid. MORRISTON, forwardly placed along the inside, steadily
faded racing into the turn. BIZ NOW, roused to contend between foes in early stages, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
COMMANDEER was rated between foes tracking just off the leaders while momentarily caught in close quarters entering the backstretch, shifted to the
three path entering upper stretch advancing on the pacesetter, took over leaving midstretch and went well clear under pressure. WELL TOLD, in touch
attending a rival's pace in the opening half, pressed the pace entering the far turn, gained a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch but proved no match
for the winner late. SUMMER SILENCE tracked the pace inside foes in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and continued well enough to edge
rivals for a share. FERMAT tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight, made brief progress three wide racing into the far turn but lacked the needed
late kick. HARPOON HARRY, urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
GRAN CASIQUE angled inwards to dictate the pace between foes just off the rail racing into the turn, angled to the rail racing into upper stretch while being
prompted to extend the advantage and held sway through the lane under pressure. OUTSTANDING DEBT tracked off the second flight outside foes in the
opening stages, advanced four wide racing into the turn to loom outside the winner but couldn't gain terms with that rival. CHINOMADITO, off slowly, angled
out five wide in upper stretch and continued well enough to earn a share. IMPERIAL IVOR, urged to a forward placing three wide between foes, faded in late
stages. TRULY STELLAR, carried inwards at the start by FREE FLAYME, was urged along the rail to gain a forward placing tracking just inside the
pacesetter entering the turn but steadily faded into the lane. INDIAN BUZZ tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn but lacked the
needed closing response. FREE FLAYME ducked inwards at the start impeding a rival, was held up between foes avoiding close quarters racing through
the backstretch and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
GET BACK HOME, held up avoiding tight quarters at the start, settled outside a rival to the backstretch, was prompted to advance outside foes racing
through the far turn, swung six wide in upper stretch and produced a steady late response to prevail in time under firm handling. MERICATHEBEAUTIFUL,
reserved along the inside, gained position between foes racing through the far turn, split rivals just off the inside to challenge for command midstretch but
was just outkicked. MIDNIGHT BELLA tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening half, gained contention racing four wide on the far turn, was
carried out racing into upper stretch, contested the issue past the furlong marker but was outkicked. SIGNING BONUS, urged along the inside dictating the
pace on a narrow margin, dispatched a rival nearing the far turn, continued to dictate terms shifting off the inside, drifted out markedly nearing upper stretch
crossing into the path of BUNNY PRINCESS while also carrying out MIDNIGHT BELLA, pressed the issue between foes to midstretch but yielded late.
BUNNY PRINCESS tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight, was prompted to bid three deep between foes nearing upper stretch, was carried out
by SIGNING BONUS while caught in tight quarters racing into upper stretch and lacked the needed final response. INHONOROFOWENJR tracked the
leaders inside a rival in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but had no final bid. R B C GOLD angled to the inside tracking off the second flight but
lacked a closing response. UNITEDTORUN tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch but faded after a half. PRINCESS RENEE was
urged to prompt the pacesetter racing to the backstretch and gave way entering the far turn. SENORITA AURORA trailed. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
RIDER OF BUNNY PRINCESS LODGED CLAIMS OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDERS OF MIDNIGHT BELLA AND SIGNING BONUS WHILE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE RUN INTO THE STRETCH, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED
SIGNING BONUS FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER FIFTH.

Footnotes
MISS TOURISTA, reserved off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, advanced on the leaders four wide on the far turn to upper stretch, took
over leaving the furlong marker and went clear late under firm handling. SUCCESSFUL LEGACY, forwardly placed three wide racing to the backstretch,
shifted in nearing the far turn to press the issue between foes, dueled to midstretch but couldn't contain the winner, then prevailed for the place honors while
her rider took his mount in hand nearing the wire. STRIKING CHROME tracked the leaders inside a rival as part of the second flight, shifted out four wide
racing into upper stretch and finished with interest to just miss for second. JADA'S KINGDOM, urged inside foes dictating the pace on a narrow margin to
the backstretch, dueled for command inside rivals through the far turn to upper stretch and gave way. SAYOH, reserved along the inside racing to the
backstretch, shifted out to race three wide between foes into upper stretch but offered no rally. ALEX'S FIRST tracked the leaders outside a rival in second
flight, made brief progress three wide nearing the far turn but lacked the needed late bid. GRIMHILDE settled last to the far turn and failed to menace.
GOLDEN OLDIE, urged between foes prompting the pace to the backstretch, faded after a half.

Footnotes
VARSITY FLYGIRL, urged to gain the lead racing a bit off the rail through the backstretch, dictated the pace on a clear margin into the turn, turned back a
rival's challenge racing into upper stretch and widened the advantage late under pressure. JULIE'S GRACE tracked the leaders along the inside in the
opening quarter, shifted outside the pacesetter entering the turn while advancing to press that rival, disputed the issue to upper stretch but proved only
second best in the drive. HELLO ROSIE SAY was rated just off the second flight between foes in the opening stages, gained position just off the inside
entering the turn, shifted out three wide midstretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair. LALOBA FEROZ broke awkwardly dropping out
last early, switched outside foes to make brief progress four wide racing into the turn but had no closing response. WATCH ME TANGO angled inwards in
the opening stages tracking just off the pacesetter but steadily faded inside foes racing into the turn. SUNDANCE PEAK was a brief factor three wide
between foes tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn but was through after a half. VOODOOISM was cast in the starting gate, necessitating her
late scratch.

Footnotes
SWINGIN FRIAR, reserved last near the inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes entering the far turn commencing a steady, four wide
advance, shifted out five wide in upper stretch and rallied to the lead in time under firm handling. MONETIZED tracked off the first flight along the inside to
the backstretch, shifted out avoiding close quarters to race four wide into upper stretch to challenge for command, struck the front between calls late but
couldn't contain the winner. MONITOR MILLS sped to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace into the far turn, dueled
for command inside foes entering the stretch but weakened late. RAL COPPERHEADROAD, reserved along the inside racing to the far turn, angled out five
wide in upper stretch and made some belated progress. INTO PARADISE, pulling between foes racing to the backstretch prompting the pacesetter,
continued to track just off the leaders to upper stretch and weakened late. MISH, forwardly placed three wide prompting the pace, pressed the issue into the
far turn and gave way in the drive. NEFARIOUS FELLA was rated off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing
bid. ON THE LIPS was rated between foes off the second flight to the far turn but offered no rally. ONE MOST WANTED broke awkwardly losing position to
the field, was prompted to gain some position three wide racing to the far turn but came up empty in the drive. KITTEN'S CLOWN tracked the leaders
outside a rival as part of the second flight to the backstretch but faded after a half.

BOLD PAYNTER raced unhurried while caught four wide to the first turn, shifted inwards midway through the backstretch to gain some position three deep
between foes approaching the second bend, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch to advance inside the leaders and wrested a narrow advantage in the
closing stages under firm handling. SANCOCHO (MEX) was urged to gain a forward placing while caught four deep, then three wide racing into the
backstretch, tracked just outside the pacesetter to the far turn, moved to challenge for command in the three path racing into upper stretch, struck the front
nearing the furlong marker but couldn't contain the winner late. THE STIFLER sped to the lead racing to the first turn while a bit off the rail, dictated the pace
in that path to the far turn, dueled between the top pair into upper stretch but yielded to those rivals midstretch. PRAETORIAN tracked off the first flight three
wide between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance but had no late bid. MYSTIC LINK settled
between foes in the last flight in early stages and passed only tiring rivals. SNAP HOOK tracked off the first flight between foes to the backstretch but
steadily faded after a half. PINSON, urged to a forward placing along the inside racing to the backstretch, retreated early. DOX FOLLY settled along the
inside racing to the first turn and dropped out early.

EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE raced three deep into the first turn gaining terms with the second flight, was lightly rated to stalk just off the leaders racing to the far
turn, advanced with a sharp, three wide move to wrest the advantage racing into upper stretch, quickly moved away to a commanding advantage and was
kept to firm encouragement. STARSHIP GODDESS was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, swung out four wide nearing upper
stretch and proved best of the others. TRULY was rated outside rivals in second flight to the backstretch and continued with interest to improve position
three deep between foes late. BEAUTIFUL TIZ switched outside foes racing to the backstretch, was caught four, then five wide leaving the far turn to upper
stretch but continued to improve position. BOASTFUL CONTESSA settled along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out racing into upper stretch but was
shuffled while caught in tight quarters late while exchanging bumps nearing the wire. WILD NORTH, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the
pacesetter, advanced to press the issue on the far turn but gave way in the drive. STONEY'S MONKEY settled last to the far turn and proved no threat.
KATIE SCARLETT, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace to far turn and gave way inside foes entering the lane. SAVED AT THE WIRE,
forwardly placed along the inside in the opening stages, steadily faded after a half.
