Footnotes
SO MUCH HAPPY sprinted clear and angled to the rail, set all the pace to the stretch, urged right-handed through the final furlong and held gamely.
GOODTINGSCOMINPINK stalked in the two path then exited the far turn three wide, rallied from outside and kept gaining to the wire. PUSHING SIXTY
stalked the pace from inside to the stretch, tipped out at the top of the lane and finished willingly for a clear third. SUGAR PICKEL traveled in mid-pack and
along the rail, cut the corner into the stretch and improved position. COWBOYS DAUGHTER stumbled a bit leaving the gate but recovered quickly to chase
closest outside the leader in the two path, lost ground between runners leaving the far turn and weakened in the drive. DYNAPOWER raced off the pace,
saved ground then angled out in upper stretch and could not rally. GALLANTLYSTREAMING (IRE) fought the rider through the first turn to the five-eighths,
switched off the inside on the backstretch, angled out on the second turn and came four wide into the stretch and weakened. CHROME OF OUR OWN
raced mid-pack through the early going outside a rival, started to weaken around the final turn and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
BETITO vied for the lead from outside into the first turn then cleared inside rival, showed the way in the two path to the stretch and held safely. TWIRLING
DERBY stumbled in the beginning, tucked inside on the first turn, went inside a trio up the backstretch, came off the rail around the far turn and finished well
to prove second best. JOHAN ZOFFANI (IRE) broke a bit, chased four wide into the first turn then five wide into the backstretch, went four deep at the
half-mile pole, moved in a bit around the far turn then entered the stretch four wide and flattened out. MONGOL ALTAI stumbled leaving the gate, trailed the
field through the early stages, angled out around the second bend and exited five wide, kept on to fill out the superfecta but was never a threat. BROKEN
FINGER chased off the rail then outside a rival, three deep at the half-mile pole, shifted in entering the stretch and weakened. ANOTHER CHAPTER vied
for the lead from inside then was in a bit tight entering the first turn, altered outside the leader and chased off the rail, raced between foes from the half-mile
marker to the three-eighths, dropped back around that turn and tired.

Footnotes
REEDLEY broke alertly to take control set the pace to the turn, led a bit off the rail into the drive and held safely under right-handed urging and steady
handling late. BLACK STORM raced in mid-pack then angled in and saved ground to the stretch, tipped out mid-stretch and gained on the winner late.
RICKEY B stalked four wide to the stretch, needed to find more in the final furlong but kept on to secure the show. JAN'S RESERVE tossed his head and
came away to a slow beginning, raced in the two path into the turn, moved inside then then two wide into the lane, came out upper stretch and improved
position. AFTERNOON HEAT dropped to the rear of the field up the backstretch, traveled along the inside, moved out to the two path on the turn before
returning to the rail and was never a factor. FACTORIAL bobbled at the start, closest in pursuit early, chased three wide trough the turn and weakened.
ROYAL SEEKER tracked widest up the backstretch, angled into the three path around the bend and failed to menace.

Footnotes
IAN GLASS chased from inside off the pace, angled out near the three-sixteenths, rallied outside the top pair and drew clear late. PSYCHO DAR bumped
with outside rival at the start, dueled for the lead up the backstretch, bumped again at the seven-sixteenths, brushed rival into the turn, spurted clear at the
five-sixteenths, continued clear to the eighth pole and offered little resistance to the winner in the final sixteenth. CASTLE angled in early, chased inside into
and around the turn, moved outside the leader in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick but held the show. KITTEN'S CAT stalked off the inside, two
wide around the turn, came out in deep stretch and summoned a mild rally. ITALIANO saved ground to the stretch and improved position. ALLEVA lost
footing and came away slow, traveled at the back of the back, went two wide into the drive and never rallied. BLACKOUT (FR) chased outside a rival then
angled four wide leaving the turn and weakened. FACTS MATTER broke well then chased the top pair from outside, took a bad step at the three-eighths
pole, exited turn four wide and weakened. RESTLESS RAMBLER broke in and bumped rival at the start, dueled outside that same rival up the backstretch
and bumped with rival again at the seven-sixteenths, brushed foe entering the turn, lost contact past the five-sixteenths and weakened.

BELLA RENELLA well placed behind the top trio early, entered the turn two wide, swung five wide nearing the stretch, rallied from outside and edged the
runner-up. TRAFFIC STOPPER showed early speed and attended the pace three deep, came four wide into the drive, grabbed the lead mid-stretch but got
outkicked by the winner. QUEEN STORMBORN vied for the lead between rivals then took over leaving the turn, held a short lead with a furlong to go and
succumbed to the top pair. FULL ECLIPSE vied for the lead from inside, lost command exiting the turn and weakened in the final furlong. SECRET
MANEUVER stumbled and bumped with inside rival at the start, was in range while outside rivals up the backstretch, entered the stretch three wide and
never threatened. TIPPY TOP veered out and bumped rival at the start, tracked between rivals then two wide around the turn and lacked further response.
EXCHANGE VOWS bumped both sides at the start, raced widest from off the pace, took the turn five then four wide and never made an impact.

CRYSTAL BALL stalked off the inside, bid outside the leader at the quarter pole, came three wide into the stretch, dueled with MISS FIA in the stretch, put
away that rival nearing the sixteenth pole and drew clear. PHAROAH'S HEART broke out, stalked four wide through both turns, finished well outside the top
pair and edged MISS FIA for the place. MISS FIA set the pace off the inside, responded when challenged at the quarter pole, fought back from inside to the
sixteenth pole and yielded to the top pair. LAST FIRST KISS angled to the inside early, tracked the pace along the rail into the stretch and weakened. THIS
TEA broke a bit at the start, chased two then three wide around the first turn, moved out into the clear on the backstretch, entered the far turn five wide then
angled down to the two path around that bend and also weakened.

Footnotes
MCWHERTER dueled for the lead from inside, inched ahead past the half-mile pole, shook free of rival past the five-sixteenths and inched away under left
and right-handed urging. TITRATE was off slow and came in at the start, traveled two wide into the turn, angled in around the bend, came out in upper
stretch and closed well. UNION BLISS chased along the inside into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend and lacked the needed late kick.
LEMONADE STAND stumbled leaving the gate, angled in on the backstretch and chased along the rail into the turn, came out leaving the turn and went
four wide into the stretch, then finished evenly in the final furlong. JUNE GLOOM broke inward at the start, raced off the pace on the inside and could not
rally. PEDRO PEREZ dropped back early, angled in on the turn and was never a factor. LOUD HOUSE tracked outside a rival then two wide into the turn,
angled six wide exiting the bend and had little left. NAZARE dueled for the lead outside MCWHERTER then pressed that rival into the turn, chased three
wide into the stretch and weakened.
