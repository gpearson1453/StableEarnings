Footnotes
ROCKS AND SALT unhurried in the early going, angled four wide leaving the far turn, got bumped in upper stretch, struck the front with a furlong to go while
drifting inward and edged clear. FUNKENSTEIN settled off the pace, traveled two wide then three wide into the lane, came out and bumped the winner in
upper stretch, rallied and outkicked TALLEMARK for the place. TALLEMARK bumped leaving the gate, tracked off the inside, bid three to four wide leaving
the second bend, led briefly in upper stretch, lost command while floated in with a furlong to go and lost the place. WARRENS CANDY MAN broke out,
stalked from inside, waited for room behind the top pair on the far turn, lacked room off heels in upper stretch, angled out near the eighth pole then came
back inside late and rounded out the superfecta. ATOMIC DROP veered out and bumped rival at the start then bumped again shortly after, took control
early, received pressure on the backstretch, dueled around the far turn, bumped with WHISKEY TALK entering the stretch and weakened. WHISKEY TALK
got pinballed at the start, chased outside the pacesetter then prompted the pace from outside, headed rival at the three-eighths, dueled through that bend,
bumped with ATOMIC DROP entering the lane and also weakened.

Footnotes
BIG TREAT got bumped at the start, dueled inside of DRIZELLA up the backstretch, shook free nearing the quarter pole, asked once right-handed in upper
stretch and extended the lead under hand urging in the late stages. DRIZELLA broke out, dueled for the lead outside BIG TREAT, could not keep pace
nearing the quarter pole, chased the winner down the stretch and bested the rest. SWANNING broke out and bumped BIG TREAT, tracked the dueling pair
from inside, moved out into the two path around the turn, lacked the needed response but secured the show. PRESKITT chased three wide through the turn
and flattened in the final furlong. MISS SHADY stumbled shortly after the start, entered the turn two wide then drifted out around the bend, came four wide
into the stretch and failed to menace. PRECIOUS INSIGHT chased four then five wide around the turn and weakened.

CASSIE BELLE was closest in pursuit outside the leader or in the two path, bid alongside at the quarter pole, took control entering the stretch, put away SO
MUCH HAPPY with a sixteenth remaining and held gamely in the closing moments. A NEW PEACE stalked the pace along the inside, steered out in the
stretch, summoned a late bid but was not enough. SO MUCH HAPPY broke out, sped to the front along the rail, asked when challenged at the quarter pole,
lost command into the stretch, fought back from inside but flattened out in the final sixteenth. COLOMBIAN GOLD tracked the pace off the inside, traveled
two then three wide around the far turn, tipped out in the stretch and kept on to earn a minor award. KLEEN KARMA stalked the pacesetter outside a rival,
came three wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. COVER VERSION lost her path at the start and dropped to the back, saved ground through both turns
and was never a factor.

Footnotes
PAPALE vied between into the first turn then stalked in the two path, moved inside and steadied off heels at the quarter pole, gained a clear path when
MONGOLIAN FORD lugged out into the stretch, drew clear a furlong out and held gamely. MONGOLIAN FORD vied for the lead from inside then dueled for
command, cleared around the far turn, lugged out into the stretch, was overtaken by PAPALE but stayed on gamely from outside. THEULTIMATEPRAISE
stalked the pace along the inside then moved into the two path, angled out around the far turn then was forced out by EXALTED JOY entering the stretch,
then kept on through the late stages and gained the show. EXALTED JOY bumped with ROADSIDE at the start, asked early while lacking early quickness,
went outside a rival on the backstretch, moved closer three then four deep on the far turn, came out into the stretch and lost the show. ROADSIDE bumped
both sides at the start, vied three deep into the clubhouse turn then dueled for the lead outside of MONGOLIAN FORD, lost contact with that rival and
cropped back between foes leaving the far turn, then weakened along the inside. SIR FLATTER bumped with inside rival at the start, vied four deep into the
first turn then chased outside a rival, went three deep on the far turn, put in tight quarters at the quarter pole, then faded through the drive.

Footnotes
BEAUDACIOUS sped to the front outside a rival, cleared around the first turn, showed the way along the inside into the drive, urged right-handed and drew
away. CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS stalked inside, steadied briefly off heels near the three-eights, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch, tipped out further and
lacked the needed late kick. BIG COUPE in range early while a bit off the rail then outside a rival on the backstretch, traveled three deep at the
five-sixteenths, came two wide into the drive and held the show. BIG FLINT bumped HENCHMAN at the start, was asked around the far turn and went three
outside a pair of rivals a quarter mile out, kept on through the drive and filled out the superfecta. HENCHMAN got bumped by BIG FLINT at the start, sat off
the pace, went between rivals at the quarter pole, urged left-handed in the lane but could not find the necessary response. BLUE STAR dropped back early,
moved to the inside, saved ground then came out in upper stretch and made no impact. FLY BUDDY FLY showed early speed from inside, ceded the lead
around the first turn then switched outside chasing the pacesetter, dropped back around the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
SHE'S A DIME sped to the front in the two path, gained some pressure a quarter mile out but cleared outside rival again and held well under right-handed
encouragement. MIDNIGHT JAMBOREE stalked three wide, angled to the two path on the far turn then exited the bend three wide, stayed within striking
distance through the final furlong, could not summon the needed response but was clearly second best. PAIGE RUNNER went four wide through the first
turn, moved into the three path around the second bend then came four wide into the stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. TRUE MISCHIEF chased
along the fence, went up inside the leader at the halfway point, was in tight and checked at the seven-sixteenths pole, remained inside to the stretch and
weakened. DIVA IN CHARGE was fanned five wide into the first turn, trailed up the backstretch, angled in around the far turn, eased in the drive and walked
off.
