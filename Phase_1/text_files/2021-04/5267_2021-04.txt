POWER TIMES TWO broke alertly, set fractions from a two wide running position through the backstretch and turn, was briefly pressured in the drive by
WISE RIVER RAY but kicked clear in the end for the win. WISE RIVER RAY stalked the early pace, was three wide on the turn between horses while
moving up, continued to pressure the leader through the stretch but could not get reel that rival in, while still holding for a clear second. SURPRISE
FASHION settled at the rear of the field in the early stages, was three wide on the turn while trailing, began a steady bid entering the stretch and rallied to
get the show. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET chased the early pace, continued to chase the leader while four wide on the turn, was asked for run in the stretch
but tired in the drive. TIZ EMMA settled toward the back of the field in the backstretch and on the turn, was three wide on the turn, lost position coming into
the drive and could not mount a late rally. LEADVILLE settled in the midflight through the backstretch, saved ground through the turn while still running in
the middle of the pack and weakened in the stretch drive.

CLOCHARD STREET was allowed to settle through the early stages, saved ground while two wide along the turn running toward the rear, swung three wide
into the stretch, and made a late rally in the final sixteenth to prevail. ROYAL ALEXIS assumed command of the early pace while saving ground on the rail,
widened the margin along the turn while continuing to save ground, was still leading inside of the sixteenth pole but was reeled in by CLOACHARD STREET
in the final stages while holding on to second. ICE KITTY settled midpack for the backstretch run, continue to be close up while still midflight on the turn
while two wide, chased the pacesetter into the stretch and was outkicked late. RACHEL'S LADY had no early speed, trailed through the backstretch and run
on the turn while saving ground and was not a factor late. SUPER BUNNY stalked the early pace from a ground saving position, continued to be close up on
the turn while saving ground, was outrun into the stretch and was not a threat late.

leader through the backstretch and second turn while two wide, closed the margin on the leader in the stretch and prevailed late. COLLUSION DELUSION

contested pace, was two wide along the second turn while still close up, swung three wide for the stretch run, pressured the top two but could not reel those

Footnotes
LET'S REJOYCE was sent hard to get the lead, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then edged clear under urging and held determinedly. THE LITTLE
H MAN was outrun to the turn, raced three wide then swung out for room in upper stretch and finished in a rally. PAPAPIFAS was chasing the winner while
three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. SQUARE DEAL pressed the pace in the two path to the stretch, was also outrun
by the winner to mid stretch and weakened. TORPEDO AWAY had no speed, was outside the runnerup and four wide to the stretch, shifted out widest for
the drive but lacked the needed late response. COWBOY KISSES was stalking the pace from the rail to the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
CHIEF JACKSON tracked the leader to the turn, bid three wide then eased out in the stretch, responded when set down and closed stoutly to win going
away. FALSELY ACCUSED was chasing the pace early then was outside the winner and four wide to the stretch, did not threaten then that one but gamely
grabbed the place. EXCEED SPEED LIMIT pressed the leader in the two path to the stretch, pushed up to briefly duel but was outkicked by the winner and
lost second late. BOLD VOYAGER was outrun to the turn, got fanned five wide to the stretch and lacked the needed late response. MINEHUNTER hustled
to the front, shifted in and set the pace from the rail to the stretch then was overtaken and tired. MYSTIC TRAVELER had no speed, trailed in the two path
to the stretch and was never a threat. J T'S CREDITCARD got outsprinted to the turn then was also fanned out five deep to the stretch and did not rally.'.
ARKADIAN FOREST got outsprinted early then saved ground but stopped in the stretch.
