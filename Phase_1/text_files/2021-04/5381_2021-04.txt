Footnotes
SOUTHERN CENTS raced off the pace while along the inside early, advanced to be closest to the leader into the far turn, quickly overtook that rival from
the outside midway on that bend, quickly clear into the stretch, drew out strongly, ridden out. HENNY FLY broke alertly, set the pace along the inside,
remained clear into the far turn, offered little resistance to the winner late in the final bend, no match stretch, saved the place. MOONSHINE DANCING
settled off the pace and the inside, three wide into the second turn, advanced a bit through that bend, got out and was four wide into the stretch, slowly
getting to the runner up late, clear of the others. CITY GONE COUNTRY chased the runner up early while off the inside, began to weaken after a half.
GYPSY WIND went one paced throughout while racing toward the inside. SANTA ANA WINDS dwelt at the start to spot the field a couple of lengths, trailed
early, made little impact. DIXIE LOVING was finished after a half.

Footnotes
LINDSYLU broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, continued to set the pace through the turn just off the inside, drew out through
the lane under steady handling. SEEKING HONOR forwardly placed toward the inside, moved a bit closer to the winner in some traffic exiting the turn,
moved out a bit for the drive, proved no match in the run to the wire, remained clear for the place. HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN lacked early foot toward the
inside, steered out to be three wide by late in the turn, along for the show while not a serious threat while remaing out in the strip. VILLAREGGIA settled in
mid pack and in the two path, continued one paced through the stretch in lacking a closing response. POLYESTER BRIDE prompted the winner for a half
three wide then gave way in the drive. EDEN last away, failed to menace. WILDWOOD FLASH was finished before four furlongs.

PRESLEY broke out, bumped and bothered TRIPLE HAPPY, was straightened to show the way up the backstretch in the two path, continued to set the
pace turn just off the inside, kicked well clear through the stretch under steady handling. KELLY BE KRUSIN broke into the inside portion of his gate,
bothered to be off slowly, moved up steadily, three wide into the lane, rallied for the place, no threat to the winner. DO ME A FAVOR forwardly placed while
racing outside, three wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick while lasting for the show. B'S LIL' BUMBLEBEE within striking distance off the inside and
between rivals, also came up empty for the stretch run. RICHNESS void of speed just off the inside, improved position a bit without posing a serious threat.
LOUEMMA forwardly placed early after breaking with the leaders, checked up in tight quarters along the rail into the turn, fell back and failed to recover.
TRIPLE HAPPY bothered and bumped at the start, moved up to a forward position after recovering, saved some ground through the turn then gave way in
the drive. RACHIE RACH off the early pace out in the strip, moved closer with a four wide move through the turn, gave way in the drive.

BACKGROUND prompted the pace while off the inside, continued to force the issue into the far turn, bid between rivals through that bend, put a head in
front entering the stretch, shook clear then held the runner up safe late. NECKER ISLAND forwardly laced early toward the inside, in some traffic late in the
final turn, split rivals entering the stretch, set down when clear, slowly getting to the winner late. POLAR WIND shuffled back along the inside late in the first
turn, trailed up the backstretch and into the final turn, saved ground into the stretch, came off the inside when lodging a late rally, up for the show in the
waning strides. MO'S MOJO set the early pace along the inside, headed far turn, steadily faded in the run to the wire. LYKAN settled off the pace and the
inside, angled four wide into the lane, finished up evenly in lacking a closing punch. BRUDER BOB forwardly placed while outside, three wide through the
first turn, stalked in the run up the backstretch in hand, asked along midway on the second turn, came up empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
MAJOR BROWN settled off the pace inside, moved closer into the far turn, steered out for the drive, collared the leader with a sixteenth to run, kicked cler.
SINGANDCRYINDUBAI with the pace into the first turn while widest of the first flight, cleared late in that bend, showed the way under light restraint up the
backstretch and into the far turn, could not contain the winner in the late going, held sway for the place. AQUALITYINDIVIDUAL settled off the pace, saved
ground into the far turn, continued inside, closed the gap on the runner up late. HAVE A PLAN lacked speed while three wide, angled four wide into the lane,
improved a bit with some mild late interest. GOSPEL ABE off a step slow, raced back, passed a few tiring rivals while never a serious threat. COLLECTION
pressed the issue early along the inside, chased up the backstretch, had little left for the stretch run. FLASHYMEISTER broke back, was always outrun.
STORMINSIDE with the early leaders between horses into the first turn, rank, pulled, fell back bit, remained in a forward position up the backstretch and
then gave way in the far turn.

Footnotes
FLAT LUCKY outrun for three furlongs inside, advanced along the rail under clever handling late in the turn, steered out three wide for the drive, closed with
good energy to win going away.-. COWORKER broke back, trailed up the backstretch and into the turn, moved out to be three wide exiting the turn, finished
with good determination to be up in time for the place. ROYAL COMMISSION away in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, proved no match for
the winner when that one challenged past the furlong marker, nipped late for the second spot. COROT broke sharp, alternated up front in the two path, also
weakened in the late going to lose a position or two. HE'S MUNNIE raced in the second flight while racing three wide, came up empty for the drive. CLEAR
THE MINE four wide when also with the main body through the turn, had nothing for the drive as well. DRILL'S LI'L MAN off the pace in the two path,
backed up steadily through the stretch.

Footnotes
RAGGEDY ANNIE off the pace in the two path, came three wide out of the turn, moved out a bit to be widest down the lane, closed with good energy to be
up time. EURO ME off a step slow, lagged well back early, saved some ground turn when beginning to advance, split foes past the furlong marker, lugged
bit late, outkicked in the final strides. MISS ANTIOCH in the second flight off the inside, came three wide into the stretch, not enough for the show.
BAILESTON LASSIE broke very alertly to be clear immediately afterward, continued to show the way by daylight through the turn, confronted with less than
a furlong remaining and faltered in the late going when headed. WHISTLIN' DIXIE in the second flight along the inside, had little for the drive. HENRYS
DEAL chased the leader for three furlongs, gave way. UNDECIDEDCERTAINTY broke back, moved in toward the rail, failed to respond. RED BOTTOM
REBEL finished early, trailed home.

steady handling. CANDY CARLOS broke alertly, showed the way through the first turn inside, dueled inside the winner the middle half, could not keep up
with that one late, narrowly held the place. HERE COMES DOC settled in the second flight early inside, three wide through the second turn, set down for the
drive, finished willingly to be rapidly getting to the runner up late. LAUGHING FOX void of speed, moved out, came four wide when making a mild advance
out of the final turn, continued to show some mild interest to the wire. SONNY SMACK broke back, trailed early, improved off the inside through the second
turn, failed to sustain that advance in flattening out in the drive. PICKFORD void of speed, moved out three wide through the second turn, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. BLUERIDGE TRAVELER settled in mid pack, tired in the drive. WHEREWEGOIN in the second flight inside, was
finished after five furlongs. EPIC (ARG) finished early, trailed home.

HEART FULL OF SOUL in the second flight off the inside, tipped out four wide turning for home, rallied with good determination to be up between rivals.
BECCA'S ROCKET back off the pace and the inside, four wide the latter half of the turn, rallied outside the winner, finished willingly while too late for the
win, gained the nod for the second spot. MISS TWENTY outrun along the inside, saved ground through the turn, rallied up the inside to also be going well at
the end, missed the place. SOUTHERN GRAYCE broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, turned back a mild bid midway on the
turn, clear again midstretch, could not contain the top two at the wire. SPUN D'ETAT in the middle of the pack while racing off the inside, had nothing for the
drive. DEVILISH WIT last to leave, trailed most of the way while off the inside, never a threat. SIMPLY SOVEREIGN closest to the leader up the
backstretch, closed the gap on that one with a brief bid midway on the turn, gave way in the drive.

EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR with the early pace in hand, took over in the two path into the far turn, clear midway on that bend, held the next two off the final
sixteenth under steady handling. RANDOM AFFAIR tracked the leaders inside, moved closer into the far turn while continuing along the rail, worked way to
be three wide when lodging a mild bid into the lane, fell back off of two foes when straightened for home, came back to earn the place while unable to get to
the winner. RISKY SITUATION in the second flight while four wide into the first turn, within striking distance in the two path, moved closest to the winner
when straightened for home, flattened out late to be outkicked for the place. SHINE JACK'S DREAM settled off the pace toward the inside, advanced off the
inside through the second turn to improve position, flattened out a bit in the final furlong. PURE IRON off a step slow, lacked speed while racing along the
inside, saved ground, improved position a bit while not a serious threat. SPIRIT SOUL void of speed, trailed after a half, passed some tiring rivals to improve
position, while also not a real threat. OREGON COUNTY broke back, five wide into the first turn, continued to lack speed, also picked up some faltering
rivals while never dangerous. MOONSHINE MOMENT within striking distance for a half, gave way after a half. DOVER LIGHTS broke in and slowly, raced
five wide and back into the first turn, five wide again in the second bend, remained always back. LOU'S ARROW broke on top, narrowly set the pace along
the inside, gave way when headed after five furlongs. SHARP WILLY forwardly placed while four wide into the first turn, steadily backed up, stopped far
turn, jogged in while well beaten.
