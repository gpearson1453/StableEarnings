allowed to settle early, raced six wide into the second turn, took a brief lead and finished a game third. MCKENZIE HONEY pressed the early pace, raced
five wide into the second turn and tired. HOUSEMAKER (GB) was unhurried early, raced seven wide into the second turn and flattened out. DELTARY set a
pressured early pace, went four wide into both turns and weakened. LA MER was reserved early, went three wide into the second turn and never fired.
