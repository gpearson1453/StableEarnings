Footnotes
PISTOL BOX was lightly bumped early by SHELL FIRE, settled toward the rear inside of SERTOMAN early, was pushed along and began to rally in the
three path on the turn, was driven three wide from upper stretch, sustained his rally, and wore down SHELL FIRE in the final fifty yards. SHELL FIRE broke
in and bumped PISTOL BOX in the opening strides, tracked the leader through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, bid outside the pacesetter
past the seven sixteenths, loomed through midstretch, headed the leader past the furlong pole, kept on under a drive but was worn down in the final fifty
yards. DRIVER DAN was hustled to a clear lead, raced keenly while still setting the pace down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, was
engaged by SHELL FIRE near the three eighths, kept on while maintaining a narrow lead inside him to the furlong mark, was overhauled past that pole and
weakened inside. GO FOR SHERRIE chased the leading pair through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, was pushed along while saving
ground on the far turn, went to a drive inside behind the leader in upper stretch, but proved no match for the top three. SATURDAYS HANGOVER broke
slightly slowly, settled at the rear through the clubhouse turn and for the backstretch run, was pushed along in the three path past the three eighths, went to
a drive near the five sixteenths, continued under urging three wide in upper stretch, but failed to muster a rally. SERTOMAN settled two wide toward the
rear, began to fade in the five path from the seven sixteenths, and was allowed to trail home without urging in the lane.

Footnotes
APRIL'S GEM bumped mildly with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in well behind the leader for
the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, dueled gamely down the lane and pulled clear in the final sixteenth
of a mile. SPEAK ENGLISH was urged to the early lead while saving ground around the first turn, opened up further on the field while racing up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and dueled gamely the length of the stretch, giving way in the final strides. COUGER bumped with
the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, navigated the
far turn from the two path, gained ground in upper stretch and chased the top two home from there. MISS HATTIE saved ground while trailing the field
through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn in the two and three paths, and passed tiring horses while drifting out in the stretch. VOL DE SOLEIL
raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path, made a mild bid nearing the
quarter pole, improved position in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. MIKE'S LADY saved ground around the first turn, settled in in the
middle of the pack up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and made no bid. FULL OF HEART raced in the two path around the
first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack, angled in to save ground around the far turn, began to drop back midway around the turn
and continued to tire from there.

MONGOL BULL raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid nearing the quarter pole, dueled on the rail
in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final furlong. SEANSHINE led the field on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn,
dueled in upper stretch, drifted into the path of EASTER MUSIC and bumped with that rival near the eighth pole, and gave way from there. BOOM BOX
trailed the field early, raced in the three and four path around the turn, swung wide and launched a bid entering the stretch and gained ground on the far
outside to the wire. GUMWRAPPER pressed the pace on the inside in the opening stages, raced between horses in the two path around the turn, drifted in
slightly with a furlong to go, was steadied slightly and then finished evenly. EASTER MUSIC raced off the pace up the backstretch, drifted mildly out to the
three path headed into the turn, entered the stretch between horses in the two path, began a bid in upper stretch, was blocked and bumped by SEANSHINE
just past the eighth pole, forced to check and could not make up the lost ground from there. DEMAND RANSOM hopped up leaving the gate, chased the
leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, raced evenly in upper stretch and was outkicked late. THE TRAINER OF
HORSE 7 CLAIMED AN OBJECTION ON HORSE 1 REGARDING THE INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH. THE RIDER OF THE 7 CLAIMED FOUL ON BOTH
THE 1 AND 4. ADDITIONALLY, A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS FILED. UPON REVIEW, THE 4 HORSE, SEANSHINE, WAS DISQUALFIED AND PLACED
FIFTH.

BRUNELLA pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path
nearing the three eighths pole, dueled down the lane and wore down her rivals late. GOOD MONGOLIA saved ground around the first turn, led the field from
the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, dueled gamely in upper stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth of a mile.
SLIME QUEEN saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and
gained ground on the outside in late stretch. SENSE OF SELF saved ground around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch and
around the far turn and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. BETTYB raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path, drifted out and bumped lightly with LAUNCH AWAY near the
three sixteenths pole and weakened from there. LAUNCH AWAY bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, trailed the field from the two path
through the opening half mile, began to move up from the two path around the far turn, launched a bid while swinging wide between horses entering the
stretch, was bumped mildly by BETTYB near the three sixteenths pole and improved position mildly from there. CHLOBEE bumped with the horse to her
outside leaving the gate, saved ground at the back of the back around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, swung
wider still entering the stretch and faded in the final furlong.

BABA LOU settled toward the rear inside of D' YANK early, continued patiently in the three path around most of the turn, started to rally near the five
sixteenths, swung five wide into the lane, rallied sharply from the head of the stretch under a drive, struck the front just past the three sixteenths pole and
ran on clear to the finish. D' YANK settled toward the rear outside of BABA LOU early, chased in the four path on the turn, began to improve past the three
eighths, swung four wide into the lane, proved no match for BABA LOU past the three sixteenths but chased on willingly to separate from the rest of the field
and prove a clear second best. INDIAN SIGN was placed on the lead, was pushed along inside into the turn, carried a narrow lead two wide around the
bend, went to a drive in upper stretch, was headed by BABA LOU near the three sixteenths, chased on while no match for that foe and D'YANK but
remained well clear for the show. GIVIN UP NONE tracked the pace outside of INDIAN SIGN and MISTER CHARMING early, continued in range in the
three path on the turn, came into the lane three wide between horses, proved no match for INDIAN SIGN from upper stretch, flattened out but was able to
hold a minor award between horses. MISTER CHARMING tracked the leader down the backstretch and into the turn, began to flatten out in the two path
near the three eighths, was driven inside into the lane, and continued to weaken. OGEE'S EKATI settled at the rear, trailed in the four to five path on the
turn, floated six wide into the lane, went to a drive in upper stretch, and lacked the needed rally.
