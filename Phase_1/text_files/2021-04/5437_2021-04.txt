Footnotes
CRYPTOSONDE rated off the earlier pace about the three path then closed to the lead past the half mile pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on
the far turn, raced clear approaching the top of the stretch, was steadily handled through the upper stretch, then allowed to relax the final sixteenth.
MELDON settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, challenged past the half mile pole and contested at a close disadvantage on the far turn,
dropped back into the stretch, though, dueled for second. FIBERTOWN took a quick early lead and rated the pace inside, was met past the half mile pole
and engaged in close chase from that point, but dropped back at the quarter pole and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. BRILLIANT IDEAS
raced in the five path the opening turn and settled outside into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, came through the far turn
about the four path and ran evenly down the lane. TAMAQUA settled back while saving ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near
the rail and showed little more. MAN OF THE NIGHT raced in the four path the first turn then challenged past the half mile pole, engaged in close chase
through the backstretch but dropped back approaching the quarter pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and weakened.

Footnotes
ROSSIE VAL settled just off the pace inside, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, came between horses leaving the
turn, dug in for the lead later yards and was pulling further ahead of POOL BOY CHARLIE nearing the wire, while the latter rated a slim lead inside, dug in to
the challenge of Doobiedoobiedoobie from the half mile pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady stretch
encouragement before relenting later yards. MACY'S BOY broke in to make contact with J J Wedgit Man and settled off the pace about the three path the
first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced in range of the lead about the four path of the far turn and was just up for third under the
wire. NOVA BOY broke outward to make contact with J J Wedgit man then saved ground well off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the
rail on the far turn, dueled to take third later yards but was nipped from that position under the wire. DOOBIEDOOBIEDOOBIE stalked two deep the first
turn, challenged leaving the half mile pole and dueled close through the backstretch, but dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened inside the eighth
pole. J J WEDGIT MAN was jostled at the break and saved ground off the pace the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the
four path of the far turn but showed little more.

Footnotes
JUST KIDDING took immediate control and rated the pace, was given rein leaving the three eighths pole, came under pressure past the five sixteenths and
dug in under steady stretch encouragement to widen. CRAZY IDEA saved ground early on, eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths
pole, raced in the four path of the far turn then dug in through the stretch and dueled for second later yards. GIO DUDE rated off the earlier pace in the three
and four paths, picked up the chase into the backstretch, raced at the rail on the far turn and was outfinished for second later yards. WALL saved ground
just off the pace, gave chase from the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then outfinished in the later duel for third. ROSAS WAY
rounded the opening turn four wide then saved ground on the second turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and
weakened into the stretch. CANTAKEITANYMORE saved ground racing well back early on and could only improve his position. DYNAFORM was not a
factor. THE PREDICTOR stalked the early pace about the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then gave way in the four path of the far
turn.

BE BE BOP chased the early pace outside, took aim two deep past the five sixteenths and took over toward the quarter pole, contested the edge off the rail
on the turn then dug in under determined handling to draw clear later yards. KUKULKAN was hustled to the lead leaving the chute and set a pressured
pace, gave up the lead nearing the quarter pole, dueled at a close disadvantage from that point and dug in a game stretch threat to the late going before
relenting. COMMAND THE CAT chased toward the inside, raced near the rail on the turn, angled out approaching the top of the stretch and finished well
while gaining on the runner-up. MOSS BOSS gave chase, raced in the five path on the turn and finished evenly to pass a rival. LAUGHING CAT bobbled
leaving the gate then gave chase, raced in the three path of the turn, though, weakened inside the sixteenth pole. FORT BURTON gave chase and saved
ground on the turn. ROLLIN saved ground.

Footnotes
SILVER CASTLE took the lead toward the three quarter pole and angled in to set a well reserved pace, widened at the rail on the far turn, was asked briefly
leaving the turn then taken in hand the remainder of the lane. CARTER'S RUN dropped well back from early contention then picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and improved to take second inside the sixteenth pole. THE SEVEN FIVE settled off the pace
about the three path the first turn, bid past the half mile pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. OWL RUN
rounded the first turn about the four path and was well off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far
turn about the three pat and showed little further. PRINCE OF WINDSOR raced off the pace and off the rail the opening turn and showed little response
through the backstretch. GATTOSING angled in to stalk the early pace, gave chase past the half mile pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then
weakened. BLIMEY LIMEY saved ground.
