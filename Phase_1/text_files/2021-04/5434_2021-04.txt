Footnotes
CANADA CANDY hustled from outset to gain early command while saving ground, led the field along the backstretch and through the far turn, locked into a
stretch duel with TESUQUE and won the nod at the wire for the score. TESUQUE was forced to settle for place honors after looming boldly four wide the
entire trip and dueling the length of the homestretch with CANADA CANDY. SEEING DOUBLE was unhurried through the opening half, angled out nearing
the quarter pole, was the widest of all rivals at the top of the lane and rallied mid track to secure the show. BELLA BLU rushed through the first turn and
disputed the pace from a two path stance, was well rated at the top of the lane but faded in the final furlong. MISS ORIENTA pressed the pace from a three
wide stance, maintained that pose at the conclusion of the backstretch and tired in the crucial stages. MAUI JANE settled into the second flight and trekked
the two path but lacked a rally to improve placing. FOREIGN CREATION rated back and steadily retreated after the half.

Footnotes
PEARLY broke alertly and led the field through the opening half from a two path pose, then shook clear near the three sixteenths pole. NOTHIN BUT
CLASS pressed the pace along the backstretch, was within striking distance at conclusion of the bend but failed to match strides with winner in closing
stages. CHEROKEE ROSE came away from outset in an awkward fashion, gave chase to front runners and earned the show with strong finishing strides.
PRAIRIE STAR stalked the pace along the backstretch as the outermost of three rivals, was sent for a drive through the turn but rapidly retreated in the
homestretch. NANA FAITH GLORY failed to menace after breaking a step tardy. LADY TIZFORD settled between horses through the first call before
steadily fading in the closing portion of contest. BLAIRS GAL trailed from outset.
