Footnotes
SNOW HOUSE set the pace along the inside, vied inside of PREGAME after that foe bid at the five furlong pole, sustained the duel through upper stretch,
and gamely repelled his outer counterpart a sixteenth out before drawing clear. PREGAME prompted the pace two wide, inched closer into the backstretch
to vie at the five furlong pole, continued the duel through upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, switched leads approaching the final sixteenth, but was
turned away at that marker, and proved second best. TANGO TANGO TANGO stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the dueling leaders in upper
stretch, but drifted outwards from left handed urging inside the final furlong, and only managed to chased the leaders home. PURPLE DREAM lied off of the
pace into the first turn, got keyed up and pulled forward to advance three wide and outside of rivals around that bend, achieved prompting position at the five
furlong pole, but came under a drive to sustain that position into the far turn, and tired at the five sixteenths pole. RUNNINFORCOVER tracked from
midpack two wide, but tired around the far turn and was done early. DOGWOODS COSBY was outrun.

Footnotes
GOOD JUJU prompted the pace two wide around the first turn, assumed command down the backstretch, drew clear in to the far turn, and safely held sway
through the lane. ADARA broke outwards into another rival's path, stalked along the inside, then from outside of the clear leader around the far turn, but
chased that foe through the lane while proving second best. EXCURSION pressed the pace three wide, chased the clear leader around the far turn, and
stayed well clear of fourth through the lane. TIZ THE JOURNEY trailed early on, shifted three wide turning for home, and improved without threatening. TIZ
VALENTINO DAZE set the pace along the inside, vied inside of a pair of foes after being headed into the backstretch, but weakened into the far turn. I'M
INTRIGUED was off a step slowly, lied off of the pace in the three to two path around the first turn, and failed to factor. SIR NUISANCE lied off of the pace
along the inside, and was done early.

FOREVER BOSS stalked along the inside, slipped through a large rail opening entering the lane to produce a bid as the leader drifted out, and drove clear
passing the three sixteenths pole. IL MALOCCHIO stalked two wide while in the three path around both turns, but was outkicked by a ground saving rival
while being floated to the four path entering the lane, proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, and edged place in the final furlong. TIZ SPLENDID
NEWS broke inwards, set the pace while staying a path off of the rail, managed a just clear advantage around the far turn, but drifted to the three path while
being headed by an inner foe entering the lane, and gave way between horses thereafter. MS WICKED was always outrun.

Footnotes
FINE PROSPECTURE was hard sent early on to set the pace along the inside, drew clear from a pressing rival at the five sixteenths pole, and held sway
through the lane. MENDING bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked from midpack two to three wide, shifted five wide in midstretch, and stayed on to
claim place late. CARDIOVERSION was bumped between horses at the start, trailed along the inside into the turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch to split
foes at the furlong pole, stayed on thereafter inside of MENDING, but was outfinished by that foe for place. TESORINA lied forwardly placed four to three
wide into the turn, chased the clear leader while achieving place in upper stretch, but tired between horses inside the final sixteenth. CHA CHA MISSION
lied off of the pace along the inside, shifted two wide turning for home, then three wide in upper stretch, but failed to make an impact. AMBER WAVES
saved ground from midpack, but faded through the final furlong. ESPECIALLY YOU lied far off of the pace five wide around the turn, swung seven wide
turning for home, and failed to rally. LUCKY LAUREN pressed the pace setter from the outside while under steady urging, but faded turning for home, and
further weakened in the final furlong. SHIRLEY GREENE lied off of the pace four wide around the turn, met mild traffic in upper stretch, and failed to factor.
GRANITE CANDY stalked three wide, but gave way into the turn, drifted out turning for home, and was done early.
