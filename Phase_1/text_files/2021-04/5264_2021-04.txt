Footnotes
ALWAYS CARINA coaxed from the gate, led early on, then dueled four then three wide to the inside of AFTER THE PARTY, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole and shook off her main pace rival spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, drew off under a drive and held well to the finish to prevail
geared down at the end. AMENDMENT NINETEEN chased three to four wide coming under coaxing half a mile from home, continued three to four wide into
upper stretch, closed well to secure the place honors while never threatening the winner. AFTER THE PARTY hustled from the gate, dueled five then four
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off and weakened in the late stages. BEFORE
YOU six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing taking to the inside three
furlongs out, cornered in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. VENUS OYZO restless in the gate prior to the start, leapt up at the break
brushing the near side stall and AMENDMENT NINETEEN conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased six to seven paths off
the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the half mile pole, continued four wide into upper stretch and made
no impact. AS IT SHOULD BE six paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the duel, tucked four wide through the turn and got placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths, went four to five wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
EAGLE PASS moved up then tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid while four to five wide on the turn, took over inside the quarter-pole, drifted in
from a right-handed crop while shaking clear into the final furlong, drifted out from a left-handed crop approaching the sixteenth-pole and proved much the
best under strong urging. JUSTIN FRONT moved up then pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead outside the half-mile pole then moved clear, went
around the turn in the three then four path, turned into the stretch under the crop then was headed by the winner, switched outside that foe inside the furlong
marker and held the place. TALE OF MIST broke a bit slow, angled quickly to the far outside then settled, was urged three then four wide on the turn, came
five wide into the stretch, drifted out near the three-sixteenths and failed to rally. MACHO JACK was hustled to the front, angled in early and put SKLYER'S
SCRAMJET in tight against the rail, set the pace until outside the half-mile pole then was headed, dropped back while chasing, went around the turn in the
two path and came up empty. SKYLER'S SCRAMJET was hustled from the start then carried in early, dropped off the pace while beaten to the lead and
crowded against the rail then switched out, dropped to the rear under urging, saved ground on the turn then moved to the two path late on that bend, spun
three wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
FRANKIE BARONE coaxed from the gate, chased four wide from just off the pace before advancing on the front half a mile from home, continued four wide
through the turn placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over narrow command and swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive fending off
the challenge of MAC'S REVOLUTION and gamely held on to prevail over a late charging rival. PLAYWRIGHT coaxed from the start to be forwardly placed
early on five paths off the inside, dropped back to the tail of the field midway down the backstretch and tucked three wide through the turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and closed well to secure the place honors. MAC'S REVOLUTION coaxed from the
gate, showed the way in hand four then three wide coming under pressure near the five-sixteenths when placed to coaxing, yielded the front near the
quarter pole, went four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to the finish to preserve the show honors. DEEP SEA six paths off the inside
in pursuit throughout, advanced midway on the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
DYNAMAX PRIME three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tipped five wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway, angled six wide into upper
stretch and was outkicked. REAL DAN chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, spun three wide for home and offered no response.
HAWAIIAN NOISES coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide for home and tired. MR. FIDGET
coaxed from the start, showed speed from the two path through the opening half mile, faded through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went four
to five wide for home and folded. SCARF IT DOWN off a beat slow, tossed his head soon after the start displaying poor action and was placed to a
protective hold, got eased up and then pulled up in the opening furlong before being subsequently walked off.

Footnotes
REGAL GLORY broke out at the start, was taken under a tight hold early then rank into the first turn, continued rank under stout restraint while three wide
on that bend, was wrestled back entering the backstretch then settled more kindly on the outside while given intermittent cover, ranged up four wide on the
far turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch, made a bid under a strong hand ride at the furlong marker, took the lead under a right-handed crop outside the
sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. PLATINUM PAYNTER broke out at the start then went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace in
the two path, came under urging outside the quarter-pole, responded well under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the
sixteenth-pole, fought on well to the wire but missed while clear for the place. MYHARTBLONGSTODADY broke out at the start, raced in the four path on
the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final
furlong and was outfinished while just able to get the show. COUNTERPARTY RISK (IRE) was keen under restraint into the first turn then rated just off the
pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, was asked with a clear rail opening at the quarter-pole, pursued the leaders under a drive in the
stretch and was out-kicked then just missed the show. CALL ME LOVE (GB) was carried out at the start, raced in the two path at the back under reserve,
was roused inside the five-sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch under the crop and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
RAINBOW GAL got bumped at the start by BUSTIN STONES UP due to pressure from RAFFINITY breaking inwards, chased five paths off the inside down
the backstretch near the rear early on before advancing near the half mile pole tucking three then two wide outside that station prior to committing to the rail
into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch issuing a challenge to the leader, struck the front just inside
the three-sixteenths and edged clear under a drive to prevail. RAFFINITY broke in at the start bumping BUSTIN STONES UP into RAINBOW GAL, chased
seven paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, went five wide
into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors in the final jumps. CAZILDA FORTYTALES coaxed from the gate, showed the way
in hand five paths off the inside, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole under threat for the initial time, cornered
just off the inside into upper stretch put to a drive, yielded the front just inside the three-sixteenths, then kept on to the finish getting collared late for the
place honors. BELLA PRINCIPESSA just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and
improved position for the last major share. BELLA DOMENICA eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide for home and offered no response. LADY NORMANDY hustled from the gate, chased three wide until
tucked to the rail half a mile from home, came under coaxing midway on the turn, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired. OB LA DI coaxed
from the start, chased six paths off the inside until tucked three wide through the turn, came under a ride five-sixteenths from home, swung four wide into
upper stretch and tired. BUSTIN STONES UP got bumped at the start by RAFFINITY and in turn bumped RAINBOW GAL, chased four to five wide from the
tail of the field, tucked three wide through the turn, went seven wide for home and made no impact. BLIND SIGHT coaxed from the gate, took the overland
route eight paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SWEET
LARISSA lost the rider and ran off pre race for an eighth of a mile before being apprehended, chased four wide throughout under coaxing from three
furlongs out, tired and was eased through the final furlong.

THREE JOKERS shifted out entering the main track, moved up to press the pace on the outside, vied in the four path on the turn, took the lead at the
quarter-pole, disposed of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and prevailed under steady urging. TIERGAN moved out early, settled off the pace, stalked
three then four wide on the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, gained five wide into the stretch under a strong drive, made an outside bid at the
three-sixteenths, fought with the winner into the final sixteenth then was outfinished while able to get the place. TOO EARLY settled outside under some
urging, was hard ridden while six wide on the turn, moved in near the furlong marker and finished willingly for the show. MAGNETRON tracked the pace on
the outside, chased five wide on the turn then was driven six wide into the stretch and tired. THERISASTORMBREWIN angled in while going to the front, set
the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead coming to the quarter-pole and faded. FINANCIALSTABILITY settled
towards the rear, was urged two to three wide on the turn and failed to respond. DEVIL'S CODE was off a couple of lengths slow, settled at the rear on the
outside, went six to seven wide on the turn and faltered.
