mid pack early, angled out seven wide in early stretch, was closing late and finished second best. PASSED BY PAUL was allowed to settle early, raced
along the inside, angled out through the stretch and finished evenly late. FORGOTABOUTME set a pressured early pace, went four wide into the turn and
weakened. JOHN PAUL'S BET tracked the early pace, raced seven wide and finished belatedly. A NEW TREND was reserved early, went eight wide
through the turn and offered no rally. HEZA MANEATER was unhurried early, went three wide into the turn, angled out and never fired. SKEETER WHO
was taken back early, raced nine wide and was no factor. DAVE'S GIFT stumbled at the start, was outrun early and was no threat. STONE CREEK pressed
