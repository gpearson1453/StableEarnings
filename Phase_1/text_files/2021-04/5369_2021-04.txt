Footnotes
SISTEROFTHEMOON outrun for five furlongs toward the inside, moved out when advancing midway on the final turn, came four wide into the stretch,
challenged past the furlong marker, drove clear under steady handling. GREAT IN RED back off the early pace toward the inside, made an early move just
before a half to take command between horses, showed the way through the final turn and into the stretch, offered brief resistance to the winner with a
furlong to run then could not keep up, well clear of the others. RENEGADE SUNSET broke on top, raced within striking distance while three wide, came up
empty for the stretch run. LADY LUTE set or forced the pace for five furlongs off the inside, weakened in the drive. PRECIOUS TINKLE prominent in the
early going along the inside, began a steady retreat before a half. COUVERTURE stumbled badly at the start, fell back, pulled up first turn.

Footnotes
ITSALLINTHENOTES close from the start off the inside, vied into the lane while between horses, long drive, dug in late to narrowly prevail in a game effort.
SING ALONG SUZY in the second flight off the inside, challenged three wide late in the turn and outside the winner, extended stretch drive, outkicked in the
late going while between rivals at the end. MS FALSETTO fractious in the post parade, in the second flight while outside, advanced on the leaders four wide
late in the turn, also hooked up with the top two for the run to the wire, not enough while widest of the first flight at the wire. MOORAC off a step slow, in the
second group off the inside, steadied from between horses into the turn three wide, two path into the stretch, went evenly to the wire. KALLINIKI fell back
after the start to trail, continued to lack speed turn off the inside, came three into the lane, lacked closing response. WESTERN ATTIRE remained always
back in failing to threaten. SOME WOULD SAY narrowly set the pace inside, gave way.

Footnotes
BODE'S MAKER never far back while in the second flight and saving ground, advanced to challenge with a rail bid into the far turn, dueled into the lane,
shook clear and maintained daylight to the end under steady handling. SECRET COURIER prompted the issue off the inside, three wide the middle half,
dueled with the winner outside that one turning for home, could not match strides in the short stretch run to the wire. NIFTY settled off the pace and the
inside, three wide into the lane, had little for the top two in the drive. EXCESSION last to leave, trailed much of the way in failing to make much of an impact.
EAGERLY in the second flight while racing three wide, began to weaken in the final turn. RARE FORM broke on top, set the pace in the two path then gave
way after allowing the winner the inside far turn and being headed by that rival.

Footnotes
JETS A GINNIN away in good order, set the pace inside, clear in hand through the turn, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under token
pressure to win ridden out. OUR MUSICAL MOMENT broke on top, relinquished the advantage to the winner soon after, chased that one in the two path,
proved no match in the drive, clearly second best. ENTRUSTED lacked early foot after breaking back, improved while four wide when steered out into the
lane, could do little with the top two in the drive, saved the show. LAY M OUT off a step slow, raced back and inside early, moved out to the two path
midway on the turn, picked off a couple of tiring runner upper stretch, slowly gaining for the show late. HUSH Y'ALL broke out, dropped to the inside, saved
ground through the turn then lacked a response in the drive. WAR BALLAD moved out after the break to race four wide into and through the turn, also failed
to muster a rally when called on for the drive. SWEET TATUM closest to the top two for a half, gave way when the real running began at the head of the
lane.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE ERICA broke on top, alternated up front off the inside, continued to duel through the turn and into the stretch, held a slim advantage past
the furlong marker and held to the wire in a determined effort while between horses at the end. CHERISHED broke through the gate prior to the start, broke
in good order, dueled up the backstretch along the inside, continued on equal terms with the winner throughout, not enough in the late going. A. P.
PRINCESS in the second flight off the inside, raced three wide through the turn, set down for the drive, slowly getting to the top two while widest of the first
flight at the wire. GHAALEB THE GREAT last to leave, worked way out to three wide by late in the turn when creeping slightly closer, continued to make
small progress on the top three late. SANDY SANGRIA settled off the pace in the two path in the second flight, came up empty for the drive. SHE'S FIRE
AND ICE remained always back while racing in the three path.

Footnotes
SUNDIAL broke on top, sat off the early pace and the inside, continued to stalk under confident handling the middle half, took over, turning into the stretch,
clear past the furlong marker and maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under steady handling. MARTIQUE MISS in some traffic through the first
turn, steadied, raced within striking distance toward the inside up the backstretch, steered out to be three wide turning into the stretch, long drive for the
place, prevailed in determined fashion for that position while not a serious threat to the winner. BOLD TACTICS lacked early foot off the inside, began to
advance far turn, came three to four wide out of the final bend, long drive for the second spot, outkicked. CHURCH SERVICE in the second flight while three
wide through the first turn, continued to race in mid pack into the final bend, came up empty for the drive to finish up evenly. CAPTAIN BEYOND in tight
along the rail when in traffic first turn, continued inside, saved ground through the second turn, came up empty for the stretch run. LOFTHOUSE away well,
set a soft pace toward the inside, folded when headed by the winner entering the stretch. MISS TULSA off a step slow, moved outside in the first turn, four
wide through most of the second turn, remained back in lacking a rally.

SHE'S DIVINE away well, cleared in the first turn, set all the pace in relaxing up front, not threatened through the stretch under steady handling. BEE BIT in
the second flight while racing inside, continued to save ground, up late for the place, no threat to the winner. FOREVERNOA broke on top, got out into the
first turn, was gathered and chased the winner up the backstretch and through the second turn, proved no match for that one in the drive, finished flat to be
caught for the place. AUCTION FEVER void of speed, moved off the inside, improved with a mild rally remaining just off the inside in displaying some mild
late interest. DESCENTE lacked speed, three wide trip, improved position while not a serious threat. INTO VICTORY settled off the early pace, off the
inside, faded. DRINKATTHECREEK in mid pack while three wide, moved a bit closer the middle half, flattened out in the drive. MALIBU MARLEE four wide
in the first turn when off the pace, stopped before six furlongs, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
HOLLIS away in good order, alternated up front closest to the inside, continued on equal terms with the coleader into the stretch, came out a bit under a
single left handed crop strike with a sixteenth remaining to brush DRENA'S STAR, outkicked that one late, gained the nod over the runner up. AWESOME
ANYWHERE in the second group off the inside, two path into the lane, rallied on the outside through the stretch, finished well to just miss. DRENA'S STAR
broke on top despite bobbling and breaking to the inside, dueled outside the winner, brushed when that one came out late, weakened final strides.
CROATIAN lacked early foot, raced inside, continued to save ground through the turn, improved a bit up the inside while not a threat to the top three. DON'T
FORGET off slowly to be back early, moved up steadily the middle quarter, three wide into the lane, flattened out in the drive. DIRECT DIAL one paced
throughout while racing four wide. GOLD STREET in tight at the break to be off a step slow, lacked speed three wide, failed to rally. LONG WEEKEND
closest to the dueling leaders in the run up the backstretch, gave way in the turn. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF DRENA'S STAR
AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
CONNIE K broke outward to soundly bump with RACY JAYCEE, was straightened for vie early while between foes, dueled through the turn off the inside,
shook clear when straightened for home, slight drift past the furlong marker, clearly best, geared down in the final strides. CHOCTAW CHARLIE broke out,
also was straightened soon after, raced forwardly well out in the strip, continued four wide through the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker,
proved no match for that one to the wire, held sway for the place. UNBRIDLED TWISTER in mid pack while three wide, in some traffic late in the turn, set
down for the drive, slowly getting to the runner up late. MY DAMS ATITUDE void of speed, fanned five wide into the lane, displayed some mild interest in
the late going to improve position. RACY JAYCEE broke in and was soundly bumped by the winner at the break, raced back off the pace, four wide through
the turn, went evenly through the stretch. NEELIE ANN broke alertly, vied early inside, dueled through the turn while remaining inside the winner, gave way
in the drive. CANCAN SAREE forwardly placed early toward the inside, in some traffic late backstretch, faded thereafter. RUN FEARLESS forwardly placed
while three wide for a half, also faltered in the drive. EBBI BLU dwelt at the start, trailed throughout along the inside.
