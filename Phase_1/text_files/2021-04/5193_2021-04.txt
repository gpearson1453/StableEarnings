Footnotes
ABBY HATCHER (IRE) was rated outside foes while caught a bit wide racing to the backstretch, advanced on the leaders four wide nearing the far turn,
continued three deep midway through the far turn challenging for command, edged forward leaving midstretch to open a clear advantage and held rivals on
a safe margin under firm handling. MARY'S FRANCE (FR), reserved in last near the inside racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide in upper stretch
and continued with a steady late bid to close the gap while just edging a rival for the place honors on the wire. BY THE BOOK, forwardly placed tracking just
off the first flight, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner three deep between foes nearing the far turn, was eased off those rivals entering the second
bend, then shifted out entering the lane to produce a solid second effort four wide between foes to challenge between the top pair late while just missing for
second. BACI sped to the lead, then angled to the rail once gaining a clear advantage, set the pace inside foes to the far turn, dueled for command into
upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. BEACH BAR switched outside a rival in early stages while maintaining a forward placing, prompted
the pace between foes, then dueled through the far turn to upper stretch and gave way. PECHANGA (IRE) angled to the inside tracking off the first flight but
gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
RATTLESNAKE RIDGE was urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a comfortable advantage to the far turn, was prompted to widen the
margin nearing upper stretch, held sway to late stages under pressure and was allowed to finish on his own courage late. ROCK THE PARK bobbled at the
start, settled last to the backstretch, was prompted to commence a steady advance three wide nearing the far turn, continued with a steady effort in that path
to the stretch and proved best of the others. WILLIAM CROTTY tracked the pacesetter outside a rival from just out of striking distance to the far turn, then
continued evenly between foes into the lane while earning a share. MIGHTY GHOST settled inside foes tracking off the second flight and lacked a late
response. CAMPAIGN SPY settled between foes in the last flight early and proved no threat. GRIMGRINNIN' GHOST tracked the pacesetter inside a rival
racing to the backstretch and steadily faded nearing the lane.

BAYDAR, forwardly placed along the inside in the opening stages, switched outside a rival approaching the half mile marker while being urged to prompt
that foe, continued with a steady bid to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, wrested a clear advantage nearing the furlong marker and was kept to
firm encouragement to turn back rivals in the closing stages to prove best. ALL GOOD TIMES tracked off the first flight along the inside, shifted off the rail to
split rivals in upper stretch to bid inside the pacesetter in the closing stages but was outkicked. CAUGHT UP IN YOU settled last while angling outside foes
on the backstretch, was prompted to advance three, then four wide into upper stretch but lacked the needed ate kick. SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT tracked off the
first flight outside foes in the opening stages, made some brief progress between foes nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. MISTY
EXPRESS ducked out at the start, was quickly righted, then urged to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the turn,
dueled inside the winner nearing the lane and gave way into upper stretch.

RIDE EM, was urged to the lead while angling inside leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, forged clear while shifting out
racing into upper stretch, then steadily widened the margin while his rider flashed his whip in a handy effort. ON DUTY, forwardly placed prompting a rival's
pace racing to the turn, proved no match for that foe nearing upper stretch but prevailed for the place honors. VALEROSO broke inwards bumping SMART
SOLDIER, was righted to track off the first flight outside a rival racing three deep into the turn, but couldn't produce a closing bid. SALLY'S SALUTE tracked
off the second flight to the turn, raced four wide into the stretch and gained some position late while making no real impression. TARQUIN tracked off the
first flight between foes racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. SMART SOLDIER, off slowly, then bumped at the start, angled to the inside racing
into the turn but proved empty in the drive. LUCKY TOM broke slowly and proved no threat. INTO MAGARAYQUAZA tracked the pacesetter inside foes in

along the inside racing to the far turn, angled out four wide racing through the stretch and improved position between foes late. LULLABY LAND tracked the
pacesetter outside a rival as part of the second flight, was prompted to advance nearing upper stretch, was fanned four wide entering the lane, then drifted
out late while losing momentum. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY, pulled her way clear along the inside racing to the backstretch to open a sizeable advantage
after a half, dictated the pace to upper stretch and gave out once headed by the winner. D FLAT WHITE ducked at the start, was settled between foes

Footnotes
FALL MOON was rated off the second flight outside foes, made a steady advance, four deep, then three wide racing into the far turn to reel in the pacesetter
through the stretch, prevailing in time under firm handling. PRINCESS JAVONCIA joined the pace four wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue to go
clear while angled to the inside racing to the backstretch, held sway on a comfortable margin past midstretch but was collared nearing the wire. REAL WILD
SOLUTION, three deep between foes prompting the pace in the opening stages, was shuffled out of tight quarters entering the first turn, recovered to track
off the first flight between foes, was prompted to advance between the top pair nearing upper stretch but had no final kick. AIR FORCE PINK tracked off the
first flight between foes racing to the backstretch and continued evenly three deep between foes to late stages. OHMYMY, reserved last along the inside,
angled out six wide in upper stretch and gained some position while making no impact. HOITY TOITY tracked off the first flight inside foes, was urged to
make a brief bid between foes after a half, lost ground into the far turn, then shifted four wide in the closing stages while failing to regain contention.
LOVELY TROPHY GIRL settled outside foes in early stages, was urged to advance five wide into the far turn gaining brief contention but faded in the drive.
AMBER PRINCESS was rated inside foes off the second flight racing to the far turn and lacked a closing bid. MAGIC FINNISH, forwardly placed between
foes pursuing the pacesetter, emptied out entering the far turn. FRERET, urged to prompt the pace inside rivals racing to the first turn, retreated after a half.

Footnotes
SILVER EDGE tracked the leaders four wide between foes to the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path on the far turn, shifted inwards
pressing the issue outside the pacesetter entering upper stretch and narrowly prevailed in a sustained drive under firm left handed encouragement.
BROADWAY PETE switched out three deep stalking just off the first flight under light rating to the backstretch, advanced readily to challenge for command
nearing upper stretch, shifted to the inside resisting a rival's bid to late stages but came up second best. MONEY HOUSE broke sharply, was urged to
dispute the pace outside a rival from the outset to the backstretch, dueled between foes on the far turn, then inside the top pair to upper stretch and gave
way. HAIL TO THE KING settled off the second flight racing a bit off the inside and continued evenly three deep to late stages. SHAKEM N BREAKEM
settled well off the leaders racing to the backstretch and passed only tiring rivals. SILENT MISCHIEF broke slowly and proved no threat. SAINT
BENEVOLENCE angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders and faded after a half. DEBDURITE was urged inside foes disputing the pace from the
outset and gave way midway through the far turn. COURTING MOONLIGHT was prompted to a contending position racing five wide to the backstretch and
faded early.

Footnotes
MORGAN'S Z VA, urged to press the pace inside a rival racing to the first turn, dueled inside foes to the far turn, shook clear in upper stretch and held the
late challenge of MAD GRACE under firm encouragement. The latter angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes racing to the far turn, split foes
just off the inside entering the stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner to the end. FOXY LADY, urged forcing the pace outside a rival
in the opening half, dueled for command to upper stretch and weakened in late stages. ACT LIKE ARTIE broke slowly after an awkward start, tracked
outside foes off the second flight, was prompted four wide entering the far turn to gain on the leaders in that path entering the lane but had no late kick.
MARMALADE settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled five wide entering the lane and made a mild gain. UNABRIDGED (IRE)
settled outside foes to the backstretch, was fanned six wide into the lane but made no real impression. SHES DYNOMITE tracked the leaders three wide in
second flight and gave way nearing the far turn. MARIES MELODY gained a forward placing inside foes, was rated stalking just off the leaders along the
inside to the backstretch, lost some ground to the leaders nearing upper stretch, switched out entering the lane but faded in the closing stages.
ROYALBONNIELEGACY, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, offered no rally. HOLLYWOOD TOMCAT tracked off the second flight along the
inside to the backstretch and faded after a half.

Footnotes
FINDING FREEDOM stalked just off the first flight along the inside, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch and took over leaving the furlong marker to
go clear under pressure. SON OF THUNDER settled in early stages while angling to the rail racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position saving
ground to upper stretch, altered course avoiding close quarters switching outside foes in the closing stages but continued with interest to gain the place
honors. COMMON BOND, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue on the far turn to upper stretch but weakened between foes late.
LUCK OF THE IRISH sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled inside foes into the stretch and gave
way late. FINGAL settled outside foes in early stages, gained some position while shifted out four wide in the lane but had no closing bid. AMERICA'S
JUSTICE, going a bit erratically between foes in early stages, angled to the inside on the backstretch but lacked a closing response. FROSTY BREEZE
settled last along the inside, switched out racing through the far turn but had no closing bid. CAIRO EMPIRE tracked off the second flight outside a rival and
faded after a half. BIG VIBES, off slowly, angled to the rail tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch but emptied out early. RIGHT TO STRIKE,
caught wide racing to the first turn, retreated early.
