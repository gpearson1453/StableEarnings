ROSIE'S CITY BOY stalked the pace from the three path then took command going into the final turn and drew clear in the stretch drive. KAY'S GRAY set
the early pace then was allowed to settle off the leaders and came again in the stretch drive to be second best. ZYZACK pressed the pace from the two path
then led briefly after a half and battled in the stretch drive but was caught late to just miss the place. GOLOSO was unhurried early from the four path and
made a mild bid in the stretch to improve his position. HAY HAY MY MY was allowed to settle in the two path but was not a factor. T BRADY chased the
leaders from the three path then moved to contention on the backstretch but gave way after a half.

DAAHER'S SUCCESS pressed the pace from the three path along side CANEY'S GHOST then made an outside rally in the stretch drive to be just up for
the win. TRUE SAINT vied for the lead from the two path then was challenged in the stretch by CANEY'S GHOST and was out kicked by the winner.
CANEY'S GHOST was within striking distance inside of DAAHER'S SUCCESS then went between horses to lead briefly and weakened late in the drive.
SIGUR ROS set the early pace from inside and gave way after a half. KWIK trailed the field.

Footnotes
BRAINSTORM showed reserve along the backstretch, angled out to three wide midway through the turn, locked in to a stretch duel with BRICKTOWN
BROWN and proved best over that rival in the final eighth. BRICKTOWN BROWN stalked the pace through the first call, swung to four wide nearing the
quarter pole, entered the homestretch four wide and on even terms with pacesetter but lost the lengthy heated duel in final eighth. PUNCH EM disputed the
pace through the opening half, rated between rivals at upper stretch but proved to be no match for top pair in final furlong. WHO ARE YOU rushed from
outset and established a ground saving stance, set the pace through the opening half but was unable to fend off the dueling pair in the homestretch.
EUROGOODBOY passed tiring rivals. LUCKY AND FAST travelled wide and lost ground to front runners. ZANE GRAY rated back and tired.

BEAUREGARD set the early pace from the inside then was caught after a half and came again to battle with RYDER ROCKET in the stretch drive and dug
in late to prevail. RYDER ROCKET was unhurried early from the four path and steadily advanced up the back stretch to make a bid on the final turn then
took the lead for an eighth and dueled with BEAUREGARD but couldn't match strides late and just missed. ROYALLY trailed the field early and steadily
gained on the runners to make a late outside rally to have his best strides late. STACCATO was allowed to settle then made an outside bid on the final turn
but weakened. TOWN DRUNK vied for the lead from the two path and gave way on the final turn. OUR LION KING raced in the middle of the pack then
made an inside bid on the final turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SPECTACTICAL led throughout and fought off a challenge from STARWARD on the turn and drew clear in the stretch. ON THE BRIDGE was allowed to
settle and steadily advance in the two path then made a late rally in the stretch to be second best. JUST FRED was unhurried early gained ground on the
leaders from the three path but was unable to catch the top two. KIPPER was forwardly placed then made a bid on the turn but failed to sustain bid. NOW
MIND YOU was within striking distance then retreated on the turn only to make a mild late bid in the stretch. HUMOR'S REWARD trailed the field early and
failed to menace. STARWARD pressed the pace from the inside and tired. EUROBADGUY stalked the pace from the inside but was not a factor.
