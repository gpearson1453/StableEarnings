inside and continued well while no match. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR dropped far behind, advanced inside and finished nicely. CREEDIBILITY broke slowly
then passed rivals while no menace. ABACO DREAM dropped back in the opening quarter, moved very wide into the stretch. WEST HORIZEN pressed the
pacesetter early then gave way after half a mile. FED POLICY raced off the leaders three wide and retreated. SPECIAL RISK lacked speed and raced far
behind throughout.

Footnotes
MACH TRIAL bid strongly inside on the turn, angled out rallying into the stretch, took the lead and lasted. CALL ME DADDY lacked speed outside,
advanced very wide in the stretch but was too late with a strong rally. CHRISATUDE vied along the inside, moved clear briefly in mid stretch then tired.
COWBOY MZ dueled between rivals then outside and came up empty in the final furlong. UNDER THE GRAYDAR dropped back early then passed fading
rivals. STAYNSIDETHECIRCLE lagged far behind then closed a gap while no factor. CONQUISTADOR was urged in second flight then gave way readily.
INSPIRING JUSTICE broke alertly and forced the pace three wide before fading midway on the turn.
