GRACIE G was off slowly, settled off the early pace, moved up around the far turn, raced four deep past the eighth pole and finished well to get up under
strong handling. PLAYING WITH JAXS showed good early speed from the inside, built a clear lead into the stretch while racing nearing the rail, led at the
sixteenth pole but couldn't hold off the winner in the final stages to finish second best. LANDRY KYLE pressed the pace while racing between, rivals down
the backstretch, raced five wide in the drive and kept on to the wire. AMERICAN PAYDAY was unhurried early on, raced three wide at the eighth marker
had not enough in the drive. GOSPEL JOSY JAN was allowed to settle in the early stages, raced along the inside around the far turn, raced six wide
through the lane and had no late response. RARE WARRIOR was forwardly placed early on, raced five wide at the three sixteenths pole and weakened a
bit late. EUROTIGRE showed good speed from the inside and gave way. Official race time was hand timed. Internal fractions were unavailable.

ZYZACK was forced five wide around the first turn, settled off the early pace while racing four deep down the backstretch, moved up four wide through the
lane and finished well to be clear in the final stages under steady handling. OBSTRUCTED VIEW stalked the early pace, took command nearing the far turn,
raced three wide in the stretch and couldn't hold off the winner to finish second best. REVEL CASH showed good early speed while racing between rivals
and weakened the final eighth of a mile. CLASSY MELODY was slow early on, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. VISONARY
STAR showed good early speed from the inside and tired readily. Official race time was hand timed. Internal fractions were unavailable.

unhurried early on, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. POLLY TIZ tracked the leader from the inside and faded. NO

SOONER SKUTA stalked the pace, moved up four wide nearing the eighth pole and was well clear late under steady handling. MONSTER RIVER stalked
the pace while racing along the inside, waited for room just past the five sixteenths pole, was blocked at the three sixteenths pole, angled out to the four
path and finished well after experiencing a troubled trip. E Z TAPIT was unhurried early, moved up five at the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in
the drive. ULTRA SPECIAL stalked the early pace, raced three deep in the lane and weakened. BUGGER RED showed good speed along the inside and
gave way. CANDY BARON raced up close early on while racing between rivals and tired. HOSS J W was slow early on, raced six wide into the upper
stretch and never was a factor. MR. SCRAPPY was allowed to settle early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BEAU GOSSE stalked the pace from the outside, raced three wide around the far turn, moved up four wide just past the three sixteenths pole and drove
clear in the final stages. DALMAVSMAN was allowed to settle early in the early stages, moved up to race five wide in the lane and was no match for the
winner. ARCHER was unhurried early on, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. DAVE JONES was slow early, moved up
six wide into the upper stretch and made a good late gain. HOBOKEN dropped back towards the back of the pack early, raced five wide in the lane and had
no rally. MUSCLE HEAD stalked the pace, raced four wide nearing the eighth pole and weakened. KNIFES EDGE was unhurried early, raced three deep at
the eighth pole and failed to respond. BLACKTOP LEGEND settled towards the middle of pack in the early stages, raced four wide at three sixteenths pole
and had no late response. OKIE NATIVE was hustled early to press the leader and tired. BAPTISM vied for the early lead along the inside tired readily.
