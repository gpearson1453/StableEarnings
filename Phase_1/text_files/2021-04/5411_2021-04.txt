QUIET CHARM had keen speed, dueled outside SPEEDY TOM three wide, inched away to the stretch then dug in determinedly to hold. INDIANERA
chased the leaders to the turn, was three then four wide while rallying to the stretch, looked to have dead aim on the winner but finished evenly.
BRADLEY'S COWBOY broke a bit slow, was outrun to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch and did not threaten in the drive. PERSEVERANCE had no
speed, was fanned four wide on the turn and lacked a closing response. PREACHER BROWN hesitated at the start and broke slow then was always outrun.
SPEEDY TOM hurried along early under quick fractions to duel the winner to the turn, got outkicked to the stretch then stopped in the final furlong.

Footnotes
TORQUAY had the best speed, set the pace from off the rail to the second turn, responded when hooked by the runnerup into the stretch then battled that
one hand, boot and whip got the win by a whisker. HOLY ZAGS stalked the pace to the second turn, bid four wide to the stretch, engaged the winner
nearing mid stretch then dug in bravely and just missed. FIRE DIAMONDS was allowed to settle to the half mile pole, raced two wide on the second turn
then finished willingly to the line. SCHERZO (GB) was five wide to the backstretch, chased to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch, got outkicked
to mid stretch and did not rally. WAY TO FIRE prompted the winner three wide for six furlongs, was outkicked in upper stretch and weakened. KISS RIDE
GOODBYE had no speed, trailed to the stretch and lacked a closing bid.

GALLANT WARREN was content to trail the field to the second turn, circled rivals six wide while rallying into the stretch then continued that bid to catch
POUR ON THE COLE and win driving. POUR ON THE COLE attended the pace to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch, dueled SHOT OF A
LIFETIME, was getting the better of that one but could not stall the winner. PUSH THROUGH settled mid pack to the second turn, saved ground to the
stretch then responded inside in the drive but was outfinished. FREEPORT JOE was rank off heels on the first turn, remained a bit rank to the five eighths,
bid three then four wide on the second turn, had to steady when in tight nearing the quarter pole then could not offer the needed late response. SHOT OF A
LIFETIME was five wide to the backstretch, tracked to the second turn, came four then five wide while rallying into the stretch, dueled the runnerup to mid
stretch but was tiring late. MYSTERIOUS STONES stalked the pace four wide to the half, was three wide on the second turn then got outkicked to mid
stretch and tired. RED'S SHOWTIME hustled to set the pace from the rail for six furlongs then was overtaken and gave out in the stretch.

along the second turn, lost position into the stretch and had no late rally. BERNALINHO settled in the midflight, was four wide along the second turn while

was confronted at the three-sixteenths and gave out in the stretch run. POSITIVITY had no early speed, was three wide along the second turn, and lacked a
