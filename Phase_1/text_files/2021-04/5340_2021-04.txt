Footnotes
MISS MORENO stalked the pace inside, angled two wide entering the far turn, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole and drove clear. KAMALA
saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and rallied for the place. TONALA settled off the pace two wide, moved up around the far turn and
was one-paced between foes in the lane. VIANI saved ground off the early pace, went four wide around most of the far turn, came widest into the lane and
rallied belatedly. BELLE'S KINGDOM set a clear pace along the rail, was collared near the five-sixteenths pole, resisted to midstretch and weakened.
BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY reared at the start, raced well back two wide and had a solid late gain. PRINCESS MERIDA failed to menace while racing three
and four wide. LEARNT was outrun while racing two wide. OKALANI chased the pace two wide and was through after a half. JAENT stalked the pace two
wide faltered around the far turn.

Footnotes
BEYOND HEAVENLY pursued IZSHEFROSTED from the outset, turned up the pressure after a half-mile, dueled through a long drive and prevailed in the
closing yards. IZSHEFROSTED grabbed the early lead inside, dug in when confronted by BEYOND HEAVENLY on the turn, and fought gamely on the rail
to the finish. MARICOPA broke two lengths slow, advanced around the turn three wide, had a clear shot outside the leaders into the stretch but could not
gain while clearly best of the remainder. ASPROPODIA raced three to four wide, and improved mildly for the last major share. FLAINE was a step slow at
the start, and was through early in the two-path. CATIRUSIA gained into third on the turn, but faded steadily in the stretch. GRACEFULLY broke slowest of
all, raced four to five wide, and was never involved. BELLA SOFI rushed up inside after breaking a bit slowly, and was finished after a half-mile.

Footnotes
SPINNING KITTEN stalked the pace two wide, came three wide into the lane, reached near even terms outside of NEVERSTOPDREAMING in midstretch,
dueled to the wire and prevailed. NEVERSTOPDREAMING disputed the pace inside, drifted out under left-handed urging in upper stretch, battled on inside
of the winner through the final eighth and just missed in a game try. POLICY OPTION raced off the pace three wide and rallied outside. HERO UP was in
range inside, dropped back under urging around the turn then came again inside in the lane. BUFFALO MAX raced well back two and three wide and had a
mild stretch gain. POSITIVE PHIL moved to the lead while hard held in the four path around the first turn, angled in nearing the far turn, dueled two wide
around that bend and tired in the lane. CAJUN EMBERS was fractious in the gate, steadied early and made little impact inside.

Footnotes
SURPRISE FACTOR broke to the lead, shook off pursuers being roused approaching the quarter-pole, widened through upper stretch and was being
geared down the last 70 yards. TEMPLET saved ground on the turns in range, got outpaced by the winner after six furlongs, then finished with good energy
to be clearly second best. SOUTH POINTE DRIVE was taken out three wide leaving the first turn, remained out in the course and offered a mild response to
pick up the show. KICKS ON SIXTY SIX had the rail early near the back, went three then four wide around the far turn, and gained mildly for a small slice.
AFICIONADO got clipped behind by ALWAYS MISBEHAVING shortly after the start, and posed no threat. EMOJI GUY bumped with SLIPPY at the break,
then bumped with ALWAYS MISBEHAVING, raced in range three wide for six furlongs, and tired through the stretch. ALWAYS MISBEHAVING bumped
with EMOJI GUY after the start, then clipped the heels of AFICIONADO and bobbled a stride later, steadied in tight first time through the stretch, and made
no progress three wide. SLIPPY bumped with EMOJI GUY at the start, raced two to three wide, stopped into the stretch, was pulled up just before the wire
and walked off.

JORDAN'S LEO stalked the pace inside, raced boxed in in the two path around the turn, angled three wide near the three-sixteenths marker and drew off
under a drive. MACKENZIE'S GIRL pressed the pace two wide, fought on inside of the winner in upper stretch but was no match in the final furlong.
SPROUT WINGS set the pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. STARSHIP NUGGET was bumped at the start, raced four and five wide and
improved position. JAZLA was shut off soon after the start, dropped far back early, made progress three wide around the turn and passed tiring rivals in the
lane. MISS DOMINA stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. QUEEN LEDOUX was bumped after the start, raced in range four wide
and tired through the stretch. TORN JEANS was outrun inside. ILKNUR was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. SUMMER BEAUTY

Footnotes
DEWY'S HIT took command early, rated along through leisurely early fractions near the inside, responded through the drive while drifting to the three-path
and held firm outside rivals. MISTER LEONARDO broke a step slow and was three wide early, moved in past the midway point of the far turn, came through
with a bid along the rail turning for home and finished with good courage. THORN was three wide early in striking range, ranged up to loom a threat outside
DEWY'S HIT at the top of the stretch, moved inside that rival through the furlong grounds and was outfinished between horses. MISTA DONZELLA
prompted the pace outside for six furlongs, and lacked the needed late response. JEHA saved ground to no avail. RAULITO hugged the rail for six furlongs,
moved to the far outside in upper stretch and made no progress. GODS BLESSING was outrun two wide.

raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the three-eighths pole and churned on outside to gain the place. TAPPING sprinted clear soon after the
start, set the pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. JUPITER BLUES tracked the pace two wide and faded in the lane. SMOKEY SONG failed to
menace while racing four wide. MALIBU MANDATE hopped a bit at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. BLAKENSTEIN was in tight early,
saved ground and made little impact. BARREL PROOF was outrun while racing two wide. FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL broke through the starting gate prior to

Footnotes
LAVI was a step slow to begin, recovered to a forward position early, came through a huge opening inside the leaders at the top of the stretch, and drove
clear through the last eighth of a mile. SKY CHASER tracked outside the leaders up the backstretch, got floated out six or seven wide on the turn by TIZ
POSSIBLE DEAR, stayed on task and outfinished that rival for the place. TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR vied outside OMNIA early, edged away after a half-mile
while moving out five or six wide, got overhauled by the winner in upper stretch and weakened. ELUSIVE MOLLY hit the left side of the gate and came out
about three lengths slow, and never reached contention. FOREVER MARTA bumped with OMNIA at the start, and was never in the hunt. OMNIA bumped
with FOREVER MARTA at the start, vied early inside TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR, and retreated soon after completing a half.

Footnotes
TRACY ANN'S LEGACY set a pressured pace inside, kicked clear in upper stretch and held firm under a steady drive. ODRAMARK stalked the pace three
wide and had a mild stretch gain. AWSUM ROAR was in range inside, swung four wide in upper stretch and rallied outside. FAST CATALINA raced off the
pace three wide, came five wide into the lane and rallied belatedly. CAT'S ASTRAY hopped and hit the starting gate to be away last, raced along the rail
throughout, made progress in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. MY SARASOTA STAR pressed the winner two wide and tired in the drive.
MISS MIAMI was no threat while racing two wide. DAHLONEGA lost contact with the field, was pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
DON V. sprinted clear soon after the start, shook off UNLONELY turning for home and widened under hand urging. UNLONELY pursued DON V. from the
outset, could not mount a serious challenge and ran on second best. MINDSHIP Q was in a bit tight between horses in the two-path midway on the turn, and
kept on to get up for the show between horses. THE KING AQUILES saved ground in range to the stretch, and had no rally. HIGH PRESS was in tight
between horses at the break, lagged well back to the stretch, and passed tired horses. MAYOR REMO was outrun toward the inside. CAN'T BE BROKEN
was forced out six or seven wide approaching the top of the stretch, and could not gain. UNCAPTURED PULSE chased the leaders into the turn, three
wide, and got out several paths giving way past the quarter-pole. DREAMING OF GUS was forced out six or seven wide leaving the turn, and remained far
back. KEEP A EYE ON MIKE gave chase three wide for nearly three furlongs, and faltered through upper stretch. TONATIUH washed out going to post,
broke slowest and was never close. SLEEPER RYAN S was always outrun.
