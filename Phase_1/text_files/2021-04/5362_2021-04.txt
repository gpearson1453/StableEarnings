Footnotes
TOP OF THE GAME raced with the pace about the four path the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, closed to the lead leaving the nine sixteenths
pole and came under pressure past the three eighths, was met by The Public Halo toward the top of the stretch but dueled clear of that one and held on well
with steady handling. GRAY ADMIRAL steadied early then settled off the pace in the three and four paths, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, had
range on the winner about the five path of the far turn, dug in for second past the three sixteenths pole and finished well. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE raced
with the early pace inside then chased nearing the three eighths pole, dug in from the top of the lane and was along for third inside the sixteenth pole. THE
PUBLIC HALO rated a slim early lead while between horses on the opening turn, was headed past the nine sixteenths pole and engaged in close chase
from that point, continued to threaten to the top of the stretch but dropped back toward the eighth pole and weakened. SPIDER RICO raced off the pace
toward the outside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the five and six paths, though, showed little further. Due to a timer
malfunction the half time was not available.

RED NOON RISING rated close well off the rail, bid into the turn and raced in the five path through the turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch, dueled clear a
sixteenth away then widened under steady handling. ZEN YETI raced off the pace outside then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded
the turn in the four and five paths, steadily improved down the lane and got up for second later yards. SPUN LINE stalked inside then challenged into the
turn, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn and raced at even terms through the upper stretch before flattening inside the eighth
pole. SAYWARD stalked outside, challenged into the turn and raced at a close disadvantage three wide through the turn, continued a factor in the upper
stretch, but flattened stride the final sixteenth. HIT IT TWICE settled off the pace toward mid track, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, raced
widest on the turn and showed little further. JUDICIAL broke awkwardly but went right to the front to rate a short lead, came under pressure into the turn and
contested the edge while between horses through the turn, dueled at even terms in the upper stretch but was caught a furlong away and weakened.

Footnotes
CLASSY CLASS gave chase and closed to even terms midway on the turn, took the lead nearing the three sixteenths pole, raced clear a furlong away then
just lasted with an all out effort. KELLER'S GOLD chased and raced five wide on the turn, dueled through the stretch for second and was gaining on the
winner. FOREIGN PROTOCOL gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path then weakened in the stretch duel for second. FRANKLYENERGIZED
chased toward the inside, was well off the rail on the turn but raced close through the upper stretch before flattening stride. LAUNCH LIGHT DREAM chased
from the outside, raced in the eight path of the turn and ran evenly to mid-stretch before flattening stride. MAJOR MUNNINGS took the lead soon after the
start, contested the edge into the turn, was met midway through the turn and weakened inside the eighth pole. LODE THE GOLD chased through the
backstretch, raced wide on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
OWEN'S SHOT raced just off the pace inside then challenged nearing the half mile pole, dueled to even terms midway on the far turn and took the lead
toward the head of the lane, then dug in under steady encouragement to hold on well. BEAUTIFUL BABE rated a short lead well off the rail, came under
pressure leaving the nine sixteenths pole and was met at even terms into the far turn, gave up the edge nearing the head of the lane but dug in under
steady stretch handling to maintain second. MESANGE rated just off the earlier pace in the three and four paths, bid approaching the three eighths pole and
raced in the five path of the far turn, then came along for third later yards. LIS LA VICTOIRE raced just off the early pace in the three and four paths, bid
nearing the three eighths pole and ran in the three path of the far turn, though, flattened inside the eighth pole. LEMON ICE rounded the opening turn about
the six path then stalked into the backstretch, challenged past the half mile pole but faded while losing ground into the far turn. TROPHY CHEST raced
seven wide on the opening turn then stalked into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn in the nine path then passed
rivals in an even finish. LETHAL ENTITY raced in the five path the first turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase from the half mile pole, though,
weakened in the eight path of the far turn. HAVEN'S JOY settled off the pace between horses in the four path the first turn, started a bid past the seven
sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and showed little further. FULLY COMPLIANT broke a step slow and raced well off the pace and off the
rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn. MAIUSHCA was through after a half mile. The Stewards reviewed a claim
of foul against the rider of Beautiful Babe, lodged by the rider of MESANGE, though took no action. Due to a timer malfunction the opening quarter time was
unavailable.

Footnotes
E J'S GOLD stalked outside and raced at even terms through the turn, dueled to the lead in the upper stretch, raced clear toward the sixteenth pole and
widened under steady handling. FOXRUN took quick control of the pace, dueled at even terms through the turn but relented the final furlong and had to
settle for second. MIDNIGHT IN MAUI raced off the early pace then gave chase nearing the half mile pole, ran in the six path of the turn and was along for
third later yards. HAVE A LIL PEPPER raced well back from early contention and passed rivals in the lane. HOLD ME ONLY raced well off the pace and off
the rail, bid into the lane but flattened stride the final furlong. GRAND AIR stalked outside then raced close through the turn before weakening. CHUCK
NAZTY was slow getting into stride and never factored. Due to a timer malfunction the half and five furlong times were unavailable.

Footnotes
KING LEBRON broke a step slow and settled off the pace early on, started a bid past the three eighths pole and progressed six wide through the turn, dug
in from the top of the stretch and got up the final yards. ME chased toward mid track and contested at a close disadvantage while between horses in the
three path on the turn, dueled to a slim brief lead in later yards but was outfinished the final strides. SISU RULER took over soon after the start and set a
clear pace, contested the edge off the rail on the turn, dueled clear into the stretch and dug in under steady handling, but was caught the final yards.
VODKA TWIST gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the four path, lost momentum while in tight leaving the turn, but dug in
down the lane and finished well. PLANET NINE chased through the backstretch and entered the turn about the five path, was eased to the eight path toward
the top of the lane and finished well outside. BUMBLEBEE chased outside and dueled at a close disadvantage in the five path of the turn, but dropped back
into the stretch and flattened stride the final sixteenth. STRIKE A STORM lacked room early on then bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran through the turn
in the two and three paths but was shuffled back into the stretch and flattened out the final sixteenth. TIZ TOUSSAUD chased toward the outside and raced
close four wide on the turn, then weakened the final furlong. BUBBA BAY was never a factor. CAPTIVE KITTEN chased inside and raced close through the
turn, then faded.
