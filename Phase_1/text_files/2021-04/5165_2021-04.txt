the four path, dug in while angling to the inside down the lane, got up later yards and raced clear under the wire. NEEDACARCALLLOUIE angled to the
inside and rated a long lead, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, dug in under steady handling leaving the far turn but was caught
flattening stride late. MCNALLY saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened the final
furlong. ZAP MAMA raced off the pace about the three path the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. READMYMIND settled off
the pace and just off the rail, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the three path of the far turn. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
WALL saved ground off the early pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and took aim three wide midway on the far turn, lugged in under a left hand drive
while taking the lead in the upper stretch and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. UNION GRACE broke a step slow and raced outside into the
backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the four path, finished well to take second later yards and was gaining on
the winner. SCHLOSSER stalked off the rail then challenged approaching the three eighths pole, dueled to even terms two deep midway on the far turn, lost
momentum off the heels of Wall in the upper stretch then flattened stride. LION LORD drew clear toward the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to
rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, was caught in the upper stretch then
flattened stride the final sixteenth. SCRAP IRON PHIL settled back off the rail the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. The
Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Wall, lodged by the trainer of Schlosser, though, decided to take no action.

WEST VIRGINIA PAM stalked the early pace from the two and three paths, challenged past the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep
approaching the five sixteenths, drew clear toward the quarter and widened on the far turn, then further increased her margin with steady handling in the
lane. CHARITABLE MISS settled off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and ran in the four path of the far turn, then dug in to
take second later yards. SHARP'S MISSION rated just off the early pace about the three path and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase
approaching the three eighths pole, continued in the three path of the far turn then flattened stride in the lane. NOT FOR GOLD rated a short lead inside,
came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and was caught toward the five sixteenths, dropped back at the rail into the far turn then weakened
the final furlong. KEEP LOVING saved ground off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch. MASTERDANCER settled close to the early
pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded on the far turn.

about the four path and proved no match down the lane. GOLDEN APPEAL came away a bit rank and was squeezed early, settled off the pace about the
three path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and ran in the three path of the far turn, then weakened. SIENTE EL VIENTO was jostled early

approaching the top of the stretch and passed a rival. BOLD VALOR came out at the break then took the lead and rated the pace inside, came under

nearing the head of the lane, then drew off the final sixteenth. SPOKANE EAGLE stalked two deep then challenged three wide toward the three eighths

CALLINGHERCOLLINS ducked out leaving the gate but took an immediate lead and set a well reserved pace inside, then steadily improved her margin the
last half mile to win handily. SARAH BELLUM stumbled and was bumped leaving the gate then settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, picked
up the chase into the backstretch, came through the far turn at the rail but was never a threat. UNEXPECTEDLY hit the gate at the break then saved ground
the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path the far turn, drifted a bit into the lane and showed little further. CHERISH YOUR
DREAM saved ground through the first turn then gave chase into the backstretch, though, faded past the three eighths pole. MISS CHEENY settled off the
pace inside the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch and showed little response. RAVIOLI MAMA veered out to make contact with Sarah Bellum
leaving the gate, raced in the four path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, then showed little.
