between rivals one out from the rail in the drive to get up in the closing strides. JACK'S REIGN away well and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first
time while racing just out from the rail, maintained his position while continuing to save ground in the run down the backside, rallied one out from the rail
through the final turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, and closed willingly three out from the rail in the drive to just miss. WISE MARKET broke sharply
and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, drifted into the three
path entering he lane, and closed determinedly to just miss. THE ALL BUTTON away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn,
dictated the pace through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken entering the lane, and was outfinished late. ACE DEUCE

Footnotes
NORTHERN GRAYSTAR tracked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, tipped three wide entering the
backstretch while maintaining her position, rallied smartly two out from the rail entering the final turn, took control leaving the turn, and was confidently
handled late to prove best. IRISH LUNA away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail
in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to match strides when collared by the winner midway through the final turn, but finished
tenaciously one out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. BUTTERSCOTCH BLEND dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the
first turn, forced the issue two wide through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch, rallied from between rivals entering he final turn, and
finished three wide in the drive to prove best of the rest. FULLY LENT broke sharply and was taken in hand early to settle off the pace while saving ground
at the rail, continued to save ground through the second turn, raced into a striking position while commencing her bid three wide entering the final turn, but
hung in the late going. DEVIL OF A DEAL was taken in hand and settled well off the early pace while racing three wide entering the stretch the first time,
was always well back and failed to make a late impact.

FIRST AND TEN away alertly and pressed the pace one out from the rail entering the backstretch, assumed command midway down the backside, opened
a clear advantage into the final turn, and widened her margin late while being ridden out through the lane. LA BELLE FLEUR stalked the leaders from along
the rail entering the backstretch while under snug restraint, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to get up for the
place late. INTENT ON GOLD rushed up from along the rail to vie for the early lead entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside
entering the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on the winner in the run to the final turn, rallied along the inside through the turn, and finished two wide in
the drive to just miss the place. OUR ANJA unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and
closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive to just miss the place. LIZZIES GIRL away well, and was chased four wide into the first turn, before
settling into a three wide stalking trip entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called
upon. MIA BELIZE broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, struggled to keep up in the run to the final
turn, and had nothing to offer late.

turn, and closed willingly three out from the rail in the drive to be up in time. DAT DAY broke sharply and tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch
while racing just out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, shifted three wide leaving the turn, and closed determinedly to just miss.

two out from the rail in the drive to get up in time. ALBERTA MOON settled off the early pace while racing three entering the backstretch, dropped to the rail
to commence her bid entering he final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to just miss. LITTLE BLACK DRESS away alertly and tracked the

DAD'S LEGACY stalked the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied smartly one out from the rail entering the final turn, shifted
three wide entering the lane, and finished willingly two out from the rail in the drive to prove best. NINE ONE ONE was pinched slightly at the start, and
rushed up one from the rail through the first turn to grab a tracking trip two wide entering the backstretch, rallied smartly one out from the rail entering the
final turn, took the narrowest of advantages into the lane, and just failed to last. PAY MY WAY away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while
racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished with re-newed in deep stretch to get up for a share. RAILWAY broke
sharply and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, maintained her advantage into the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, and
steadied when put in tight quarters in mid stretch and was outfinished late. AIRAFFAIR away well, but was forced to steady sharply when put in tight
quarters midway through the first turn, held a stalking trip from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn,
and finished one out from the rail in the drive while unable to overcome the early trouble. MY COLLEGE FUND broke inwards and settled well off the early
pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, and failed to respond when called upon. GUNS N AMMO unhurried early while trailing the field into
the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, was always well back and failed to mount a late bid when called upon. Following the running of this race
there were two jockey claim's of foul, the rider of AIRAFFAIR lodged a claim of foul for alleged interference midway through the first turn. The rider of
RAILWAY lodged a claim of foul for alleged interference in mid stretch. After review both claims of foul were dismissed, and no change was made to the
original order of finish.

backside to gain a striking position, rallied two wide through the final turn, collared the pacesetter entering the lane and inched clear in the drive. TORIADOR
away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace through the second turn and in the run down the

Footnotes
RUGGED BEAUTY away alertly and stalked the leaders into the first turn while being wrestled back, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, briefly
awaited room leaving the turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in deep stretch to be up in time. OMBRE' ROSE was bumped at the start, but rushed
up from along the rail entering the first turn, and took a narrow advantage into the backstretch, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and
through the final turn, held a narrow lead into the stretch and just failed to last. WILD WOMAN was bumped and squeezed at the start and dropped back to
trail in the run to the first turn, rushed up one out from the rail in the run to the final turn to grab a striking position, angled four wide entering the final turn,
and finished five wide in the drive to get up for a share. COUNTESS WOW broke sharply but was bumped in the early stages before pressing the pace two
wide from between rivals entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue from between foes into the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the
drive. ADAPTABLE broke inwards and bumped solidly with a rival to her inside, tracked the contested early pace while racing three out from the rail entering
the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive. BIRD OF THUNDER was bumped at the start, but
raced up to press the pace three wide entering the backstretch, continued three wide from between rivals in the run to the final turn, before weakening.
