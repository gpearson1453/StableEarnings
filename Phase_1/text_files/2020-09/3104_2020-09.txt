Footnotes
BIZZEE CHANNEL was keen to the lead, took mild pressure from ARRIVAL through the clubhouse turn, cleared down the backstretch, continued on the
lead while saving ground through the far turn, was confronted by CAMMACK to his outside in upper stretch and headed by that foe near the eighth pole, but
came back and proved narrowly best in the final sixteenth. CAMMACK tracked the leading pair inside of CHANGI, kept on in range inside around the far
turn, switched two wide into the lane for a bid on the pacesetter, took the lead midstretch, but was outfinished narrowly in the final sixteenth of a mile.
IMPERIAL MISSION chased toward the rear, saved ground through the far turn, rallied up the fence into the lane, was taken out past the three sixteenths,
proved no match for the top two but ran on a clear second best. SIR ANTHONY settled at the inside of the rear flight, floated out four wide around the far
turn, went to a drive approaching the quarter pole, turned for home two wide, and ran on inside of ARRIVAL in the lane while not finding the needed kick.
ARRIVAL pressed outside of BIZZEE CHANNEL down the stretch for the first time and through the clubhouse turn, settled back to track behind that foe
down the backstretch, tracked between horses through the far turn, floated three wide into the lane and flattened out. DAZZLING TRUTHS raced three wide
in the rear group early, continued two wide in the rear pair down the backstretch, floated five wide through the second turn and fanned six wide into the
stretch, and had no rally. MEMORY BANK was relegated to the rear early, raced between horses in the rear group around the clubhouse turn, inched
forward past the three quarters to chase outside of IMPERIAL MISSION, was swung four wide and urged through the far turn, fanned five wide into the lane,
and came up empty. CHANGI tracked the leading pair outside of CAMMACK early, bid three wide approaching the far turn, could not get to BIZZEE
CHANNEL into the turn, tracked three wide around the bend, was driven four wide into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
TEMPER TANTRUM dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, launched a challenge between horses
near the three sixteenths pole, and raced gamely down the stretch, pulling clear in the final sixteenth of a mile. SIMPLE LOGIC raced in the middle of the
pack up the backstretch, began an inside bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, angled out to enter the stretch from the three path and dueled on the
outside with the eventual winner, getting outkicked late and settling for second best. COHEN'S CURVE chased the frontrunners on the outside early, moved
up to challenge nearing the three eighths pole, entered the stretch from the five path and improved position from there. CLARESTOWN dueled for the lead
on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, and gave way while drifting out and then back in the final furlong. PRESSING CONCERN
tracked the leaders on the inside in the opening stages, raced in the four path around the turn and made a mild late gain in the stretch. DREAM KEEPER
stumbled slightly leaving the gate and was pinched back, raced at the back of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, passed
tiring horses in the stretch, ran into traffic at the wire when CLARESTOWN drifted in and was forced to steady in the final stride. SCENIC OVERLOOK raced
in the middle of the pack early, came around the turn in the two path and was empty in the stretch. ALTMEISTER raced off the pace the entire way around
the oval, saved ground around the turn, and was never a factor. BEEALEA veered out leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two
path around the turn and made no bid.

Footnotes
EYE ON THE FINISH tracked the leading pair inside of SUMMER EXPRESS, saved ground in the tracking flight through the far turn, made a bid inside of U.
S. CURRENCY in upper stretch, led at the furlong mark, and proved best. U. S. CURRENCY broke outward but quickly dropped in to lead, raced keenly
early, continued on a clear lead down the backstretch while racing headstrong, was engaged past the half mile mark by FIFTHATNARRAGANSET but
cleared her into the far turn, set the pace in the two path on the far turn, carried her lead into the lane, was headed by EYE ON THE FINISH to her inside
near the furlong pole, kept on well but proved second best. RISKY RISKY RISKY settled toward the rear three wide, improved between horses while racing
keenly into the backstretch, raced between horses in the stalking flight into the far turn, came into the lane under a drive between horses, kept on three
wide, could not reel in the leading pair in the final furlong but stayed on to hold the show. MELISSANI chased inside of HOOK HER UP, began a bid two
wide on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, kept on five wide but missed the show. FIFTHATNARRAGANSET tracked the leader, bid outside her
past the half mile mark but was left chasing again as she slipped away into the bend, tracked three wide around the far turn and into the stretch, and
flattened out four wide in the lane. BIG LUCK settled at the inside of the rear flight early, continued toward the rear inside of GODSGIFT, raced in the two
path while still toward the rear on the far turn, raced at the inside into the lane, and improved belatedly under a drive. MS KELA TIME broke inward and
lightly bumped GODSGIFT in the opening strides, chased between horses through the first turn, continued midpack down the backstretch, was driven in the
four path around the far turn but did not respond with enough in the lane. HOOK HER UP chased two to three wide through the first turn, continued toward
the rear of midfield down the backstretch, was driven in the three path on the far turn, and lacked the needed rally in the lane. GODSGIFT was lightly
bumped in the opening strides by MS KELA TIME, was rank early, raced two wide in the trailing flight through the first turn and into the backstretch,
continued near the rear in the five path on the far turn, and made no rally. RANGOON ATTACK settled toward the rear, trailed in the two path through the
far turn, and made no bid. SUMMER EXPRESS tracked the leading pair outside of EYE ON THE FINISH, raced three wide into the first turn while still in
range, weakened four wide around the far turn and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
WORKINGFORALIVING bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the outside early, led the field from the two
path around the turn and dug in gamely the length of the stretch to hold the victory. TRE LEE DIVINE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, began a bid approaching the sixteenth pole and continued to gain
ground on the outside in late stretch. STORMY PACIFIC hit the gate at the break, raced in the middle of the pack between horses early, navigated the turn
from the three path and improved position in the final furlong. TIMINGISEVERYTHING bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, tracked the
leaders on the outside through the opening half mile, raced in the three path around the turn, and finished well, only giving way in the final strides. TRES
GENERACIONES dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly on the rail in the stretch.
MAXIMUS IMAGE raced off the pace on the outside early, came around the turn in the three path and passed tiring horses on the outside in the stretch.
BARNYARD FIDDLER raced at the back of the pack through the early stages, began to move up while saving ground around the turn and was outkicked in
the stretch. FORT COMMANDER trailed the field up the backstretch, improved position while saving ground around the turn and made no bid in the stretch.
LITTLE BALTAR flipped his head up leaving the gate and was away slowly, raced off the pace through the opening quarter mile, began to move up on the
field midway up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the stretch. JOEY B chased the leaders between horses up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and faded entering the stretch. SUMMER DISCO raced inside early, navigated the turn from the two path
and tired in the stretch. TELETAP raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, raced wide around the turn, entered the stretch from the
five path, and was empty from there while racing in the middle of the track to the wire.

Footnotes
SENSE OF SELF broke out and bumped SUPREME IRENE in the opening strides, tracked the leader down the backstretch and in the three path on the
turn, drifted out down the lane but kept rallying under a drive, and got up in time. SHE'S HONORABLE soon led, saved ground through the turn, went to a
drive in upper stretch and increased her advantaged, came out sharply in the final sixteenth and was caught. HENRYS GIRL tracked well off the leading
pair, chased them in the two path on the turn, and chased evenly inside down the lane. STOLEN GLANCE settled toward the rear inside horses early,
improved into the bend and chased while saving ground through the turn, came into the lane in the three path, chased the leading trio under a drive but did
not kick on enough to get to them. MISS GAVEL stutter-stepped out of the gate, settled at the rear, saved ground through the turn, came into the lane
between horses, and improved mildly under a drive while gradually going three to four wide to get through horses. TWELVE RED ROSES was shut off
between horses in the opening strides as a result of the chain reaction caused by SENSE OF SELF breaking inward, raced three wide in the rear group
down the backstretch and through the turn, was urged between horses approaching the quarter pole, came two wide between horses into the stretch, and
improved position mildly. BLAZING RUBY chased inside of SUNDANCE CHICK early, chased two wide on the far turn as STOLEN GLANCE improved to
her inside, and flattened out inside in the stretch. SUNDANCE CHICK chased outside of BLAZING RUBY early, raced four wide toward the rear into the far
turn as the rear group took closer order, chased four wide on the turn, came into the lane three wide between horses, and lacked the needed rally.
ASHLEYSDREAM was bumped in the opening strides as part of the chain reaction caused by SENSE OF SELF breaking outward but came out of it
unperturbed, tracked the leading pair outside of HENRYS GIRL down the backstretch, was outpaced in the five to six path on the turn and proved empty in
the lane. SUPREME IRENE was bumped soundly by SENSE OF SELF in the opening strides, settled between horses in the rear group early, continued
between horses near the rear on the far turn, mildly improved position between horses on the turn and into upper stretch, but weakened late. TALLY UP
raced four wide with the rear group early, continued three wide near the rear on the turn, and made no bid.

DERBY CITY raced three wide between horses in the chasing group early, emerged to chase the leading trio on the turn, came three wide into the lane,
improved when pushed in upper stretch, led past the three sixteenth, cleared to midstretch, and was allowed to coast home in the final sixteenth. CLEAR TO
CLOSE raced at the inside of the chasing group early, chased while saving ground through the turn, switched out for a three wide rally in the lane, never
threatened the winner but proved best of the rest. RIDING THE TRAIN raced between horses in the chasing group early, continued between horses around
the bend, kept on in the lane, proved no match for the top two but held the show under an all-out drive late. WILL YA WIN SUM settled in second last,
continued toward the rear in the four path on the turn, dropped toward the inside in upper stretch, rallied inside of foes, was taken three wide in midstretch to
get past tiring horses, continued to improve and narrowly missed the show. LAST SPRING settled at the rear of the main pack, chased in the two path on
the turn, came three wide into upper stretch, and offered mild four wide improvement. MISTER CHARMING settled at the rear, trailed in the two path on the
turn, came into the lane inside, shifted out and passed tired horses three wide. MAGI disputed the pace inside, was driven into the lane while still battling for
the lead inside of GIVIN UP NONE, could not keep up with DERBY CITY as he rallied past in upper stretch, and weakened inside. GIVIN UP NONE
disputed the pace three wide, continued to duel two wide past the three eighths after IDAHO TORNADO began to back away, had no answer when DERBY
CITY passed to his outside past the three sixteenths, and weakened between horses. IDAHO TORNADO was hustled for speed, disputed the pace between
horses, began to empty out past the three eighths and continued to weaken four wide in the lane. AZUSA ST. raced four wide in the chasing group early,
chased three wide on the turn, and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
STAR OF KODIAK angled over to save ground around the first turn, led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the rail around the far
turn and kicked clear in the stretch to win under a drive. ANTARCTIC raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leader between horses up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and improved position on the outside in the stretch. CANDY STORE raced in the two path around the
first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, came around the far turn in the two path and began a bid approaching the eighth pole,
making a late surge between horses to gain ground in the final furlong. SAMMYS DREAM veered out sharply leaving the gate, was corrected sharply by his
rider to race in the three path around the first turn, pulled himself to the front up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn and finished
evenly. TAK saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend and was outkicked
on the rail in the final sixteenth of a mile. CLEAR N CONVINCING raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside
for the run up the backstretch, swung wide to run in the four path around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong while drifting out. HONEST TO
GOODNESS saved ground around the first turn, raced between horses at the pack of the pack up the backstretch, began a bid from the five path
approaching the quarter pole, steadied slightly with a sixteenth to go when CLEAR N CONVINCING drifted into his path, and flattened out in the stretch.
JEFF THE LION saved ground around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn on the rail
and made no bid. CAMPIONI saved ground the entire way around the oval, raced in the middle of the pack through the opening half mile and faded in the
stretch. HIGH HEATER raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, navigated the far turn from the
three path and tired in the stretch. RICHIE GARY raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field from the two path up the backstretch and
around the far turn and showed little.
