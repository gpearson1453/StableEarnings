Footnotes
SAINT ADORABLE stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to gain a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the
lane, shook clear inside the furlong marker, then lasted under steady pressure. BISHI allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid
three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and missed. TOUCH OF LA GREY well placed and between, gained position three wide through the turn, bid
on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. HILLBILLY RACER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into
the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. SPOT OF GOLD was no factor. BRYAN NOT BRIAN tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn,
came through inside and had no rally.

POST CLOSE never far back, moved to position down the backstretch, held position to the lane, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain
and drove clear late. VALDOLOBO (IRE) set the pace on the inside, shook clear in upper stretch, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the
rest. SCIENCE TO WIN stalked the pace early, dropped back down the backstretch, saved ground through the second turn, came through inside of rivals,
then could not gain and held the show. LEBASI allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, brushed a rival bidding into the lane and got
up for a share. SCATSUKU never far back, lost some ground on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide while being brushed by a rival and
faded. WANT was never involved.
