Footnotes
QUEENGOL pressed the leader from outside, asked into the stretch, challenged through the drive and wore down rival under right-handed urging.
KALYPSO set the pace in the two path with company to the outside, held a short lead through the drive and succumbed to the pressure in the closing
moments. BEAUTIFUL GIFT stalked the pace between rivals to the stretch, kept on willingly and secured the show. ISN'T SHE LOVELY tracked three deep
into and around the bend, asked in the lane and failed to respond. ROYAL BLEND chased from the inside, saved ground into the stretch and weakened.
AGREETODISAGREE off slow to begin, went four wide through the turn and never rallied. YOU'RE ALL TALK stumbled leaving the gate, trailed in the two
path to the lane and was never a factor. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
TONAHUTU (IRE) stalked the pace along the inside to the stretch, tipped outside the top pair, rallied and drew clear late. SHE'S OUR CHARM off a bit slow
to begin then split foes and went to the lead, moved clear and set the pace inside, responded when asked in the lane and turned TAPWATER away but
could not match the winner in deep stretch. HEATHERS GREY went three deep into the first turn, stayed off the rail in range of the leader, remained three
wide to the stretch, showed a mild response and edged TAPWATER for the show honors. TAPWATER forwardly placed a bit off the inside, applied pressure
to the leader into the stretch, challenged in the drive but flattened out and lost the show. MISS FLAWLESS (FR) entered the first turn between runners then
settled a bit off the rail, angled to the rail on the last turn and tired in the stretch. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
DIVINE ARMOR angled into the three path entering the first turn then moved into the two path around that bend, trailed the field off the inside, angled six
wide around the far turn, rallied to the front and took over at the eighth pole and won going away under mild urging. SEICHE set the pace with MUNNINGS'
PILOT to the outside, held command and saved ground into the stretch, overtaken by the winner with a furlong to go and saved the place. CHARLITO
unhurried in the early stages, saved ground into the lane, finished willingly inside and missed the place. TAPITUTION traveled five wide into the first turn,
settled off the pace, was fanned four wide into the lane and flattened in the final furlong. A. P. PHAROAH went four wide into the first turn, chased off the rail
then got fanned five wide into the stretch and also flattened. MUNNINGS' PILOT prompted the pace from outside, lost contact with the leader entering the
stretch, brushed with WHIRL CANDY at the top of the lane and gave way. WHIRL CANDY stalked a bit off the rail, three wide into the lane, brushed with
MUNNINGS' PILOT in upper stretch and weakened. GARTH chased off the rail then outside a rival, dropped back leaving the backstretch and into the far
turn, eased around the bend and walked off.

Footnotes
CALI CALIENTE stalked the top pair, closed in two to three wide on the far turn, took over at the three-sixteenths pole, kicked clear and drew off under a
drive and strong handling late. DOC TOMMY bumped from the inside nearing the first turn, stalked from the inside then two wide on the far turn, rallied in
the drive and failed to threaten the winner but bested the rest. ANTITHETICAL off slow and checked at the start, trailed the field early, went three deep into
the far turn, was fanned five wide into the lane, showed a late rally and got up for third. CLAIM OF PASSION settled off the inside then outside a rival on the
backstretch, came three wide into the stretch, angled out and went between runners late and earned the show. GOLDEN DOUGHNUT came in and bumped
rival into the first turn, went three deep around that bend, chased off the rail to the far turn, bid three wide leaving the bend and weakened. PUSH
THROUGH unhurried in the early stages, angled to the inside on the first turn, moved off the rail then came three wide into the stretch and never threatened.
INCREDIBLE LUCK three wide into the first turn, fanned four wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. TEJON bumped into the first turn, settled
between foes then moved to the rail, saved ground into the lane, tipped out and lacked a rally. SILVER SUMMER away quickly then crossed over and
caused BENCH JUDGE to check nearing the first turn, set the pace under pressure, inched away at the half-mile point, headed into the stretch and gave
way. BENCH JUDGE broke through the gate prior to the start, sent early from the inside, force to check when SILVER SUMMER came over, altered out and
bumped rival shortly after, went around and pressed the pace to the half-mile marker, chased the leader around the far turn and tired in the lane. SUANCES
SECRET traveled along the inside, came out entering the stretch and was never a factor. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED
SILVER SUMMER FROM NINTH TO TENTH FOR CROSSING OVER AND CAUSING BENCH JUDGE TO CHECK NEARING THE FIRST TURN. HAND
TIMED.

Footnotes
STORMIN RANGER stalked off the inside, angled out on the turn and came six wide into the stretch, closed through the lane and fought with RUN LIKE
KONA late and proved best. RUN LIKE KONA chased three deep early, moved out into the five path, rallied in the drive but got outkicked by the winner.
BLAZING CHARM angled in early, came out into the stretch and rallied to earn the show. CANADIAN GINGER vied three deep, cleared inside rivals and
entered the lane four wide but faltered in the final furlong. PASITO settled off the rail, went three to four wide leaving the turn and finished willingly.
MANRESA chased widest on the backstretch, entered the stretch seven wide and never threatened. KALLINIKI stumbled leaving the gate, raced a bit off
the rail and lacked room from the five-sixteenths to the quarter pole, angled to the inside then back out in the stretch and improved position. THUNDER
WOMAN chased between foes early then three deep entering the stretch and weakened. MUCHO MACHO WOMAN vied for the lead form the inside,
chased the leader along the rail to the lane and weakened. MUSICALLY off a bit slow to start, chased from the inside, moved out on the turn and came four
wide into the lane and weakened. AWESOME AMANDA vied between foes for the lead, chased the leader two wide and outside a rival into the stretch and
weakened. MEAN SOPHIA stumbled badly at the start, injured and vanned off following the race. AFTER AN INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START OF MEAN
SOPHIA, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT SHE STUMBLED WITHOUT ANY INTERFERENCE AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

FIVESTAR LYNCH (IRE) quickest early and took control of the rail, showed the way to the far turn, responded when challenged in the lane, drifted out late
and held gamely. WHOOPING JAY stalked a bit off the rail, took aim two wide leaving the far turn, bid outside the leader in the stretch, drifted out late and
lacked the needed late punch. CUPID'S CLAWS stalked off the inside, three wide to stretch, angled out late and closed the gap. GO DADDY GO settled off
the pace, raced three wide then four wide in upper stretch, drifted out and bumped LIBERAL late while gaining late. STORM THE BASTILLE (FR) tracked
two wide to the stretch and showed a mild response in the drive. LIBERAL (IRE) two wide around the first turn, three wide into the stretch, bumped by GO
DADDY GO late and finished willingly. MURALIST bumped early, angled to the rail, saved ground into the stretch, tipped out and lacked a rally. ROCKY
TOUGH angled to the inside, moved off the rail and came four wide into the stretch and made no impact. UNBROKEN STAR bumped early, chased inside
to the lane and faded. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
TOBACCO ROAD allowed to settle in the early going, raced three wide then angled in upper stretch, surged late and got up in the closing moments.
OCTOPUS dueled for the lead outside STREET IMAGE, cleared briefly at the eighth pole but was caught in the final strides. CAYMANS COBRA went two
wide into the lane, finished well and gained the show. STREET IMAGE dueled from the inside to the stretch, lost contact with the leader at the eighth pole
but stayed on from the inside and got edged for the show. WILD BEAN unhurried near the inside, angled four wide around the turn and was gaining ground
to the wire. CAMBY bobbled at the start, stalked the top pair into the turn, traveled two wide into the lane and showed a mild response but needed to find
more. BABY GRONK chased the pace a bit off the rail into the turn, angled five wide around the bend and lacked a rally. SURFSIDE SUNSET unhurried in
the beginning, raced four wide into the turn then angled in around the bend, moved out in the lane and never threatened. BOTERO tight between horses
and steadied early, stalked off the inside then angled five wide and had little left for the drive. RED VALOR chased three deep early then outside a rival on
the turn, three wide into the stretch and faded. MISTER MCLEAN chased three wide then dropped back on the turn and was eased in the stretch. REAL
MASTER (FR) chased outside a rival, dropped back on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was eased in the lane.

strong right handed urging. LADY PRANCEALOT (IRE) settled outside a rival then angled to the rail on the first turn, waited for room around the far turn
then angled three wide leaving the bend, closed fast but rallied too late. CATCH THE EYE unhurried in the beginning, saved ground to the lane and finished
well along the inside. ZEE DROP stalked the leader from along the fence, chased two wide then drifted out a bit in the lane and never produced a bid.

the stretch and finished willingly. QUICK (GB) stalked between foes to the stretch and weakened. PULPIT RIDER brushed with inside rival at the start,
raced three deep between rivals and was crowded a bit into the first turn, chased outside a rival then got floated out into the stretch and never rallied. MEAL

Footnotes
TIZAMAGICIAN hustled from the inside, vied for the lead then moved clear around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch, showed the way into the
stretch, urged right-handed in the lane and held well. NOLO CONTESTO bobbled at the start, showed early speed then stalked up close behind
TIZAMAGICIAN, roused three wide leaving the far turn, lacked the needed late punch to threaten the winner but stayed on well to hold the place.
STRONGCONSTITUTION came away to an awkward beginning, went three deep into the first turn, tracked off the inside then came four wide into the lane
and lost the battle for second to NOLO CONTESTO in the final furlong. ADARE reserved between foes early then off the rail, went three wide into the far
turn then moved out into the five path and responded mildly in the drive. THE STREET FIGHTER angled to the rail and tucked inside early, stalked the pace
near the fence to the stretch and flattened. MUSAWAAT (GB) chased three then two wide on the first turn, stalked up the backstretch, angled four wide into
the lane and also flattened. RONAMO off a bit slow and bumped at the start, placed a bit off the rail then outside a rival, came four wide into the stretch and
proved no menace. FRIAR'S ROAD bobbled at the start, traveled five then four wide on the first turn, reserved off the the rail, took the final turn five wide
and came up empty. MONGOLIAN LEGEND angled to the inside then moved out on the backstretch, trailed the field into the far turn, exited that bend four
wide and was never a factor. ROYAL ACT broke in and bumped rival, settled off the pace, traveled along the inside into the far turn then moved out into
three path and never made an impact.
