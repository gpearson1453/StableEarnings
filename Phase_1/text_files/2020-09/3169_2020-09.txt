Footnotes
GIRLS IN CHARGE set a contested pace, kicked clear the leaving turn and was all in the late going to hold TONI ANN'S MIRACLE safe. The latter settled
well, moved closer on the turn, split foes in the stretch and rallied. MADISON WAY reserved early, advanced on the turn, was angled five wide into the
stretch and offered a bid. LAKOTA PRINCESS raced forwardly along the inside, was checked at the three-eights pole and kept on well. NAUGHTY
SHIRLEY chased while five wide, entered the stretch four wide and kept on well. ITALIAN JUSTICE raced in striking position while three wide, inched closer
on the turn, came up empty. CATECHISM attended the early pace and weakened. SANDY SANGRIA was always outrun. CAVATICA showed little.
FOLLOWING THE RACE, THERE WAS BOTH A STEWARD'S INQUIRY AND A TRAINER'S CLAIM OF FOUL INVOLVING AN INCIDENT ON THE TURN.
AFTER REVIEWING VIDEOTAPED REPLAYS, THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGES.
