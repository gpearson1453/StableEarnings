Footnotes
SARIAH SARIAH tracked the loose leader from the inside, saved ground around the turn before tipping to the two path in midstretch, produced a bid outside
of the tiring pace setter and inside of SHE LIKES DAISIES approaching the sixteenth pole, and prevailed over that foe in the late stages. SHE LIKES
DAISIES stalked two wide, drifted to the three path turning for home while making headway on the tiring clear leader, rallied outside of SARIAH SARIAH
through the lane to make a three wide bid for the lead at the sixteenth pole, but was outfinished by her inner foe. VARTON spurted clear in the early stages,
held a loose margin around the turn, but tired passing the quarter pole, then yielded after being headed at the sixteenth pole. WILD TAPIT tracked from
midpack along the inside, shifted three wide approaching the five six produce a rally, but hung on her left lane in upper stretch causing her to lean in behind
SHE LIKES DAISIES, then lacked a kick after changing leads approaching the furlong pole. MARIAH'S GIRL raced far off of the pace along the inside into
the turn, but was no factor. MISS INHOFE was off slowly and shied a bit from an inner rival, then never got involved. SHENANDOAH FLASH raced in
midpack three to two wide into the turn, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
SHOBIZ STAR dueled for the lead outside of RUNMALIBURUN, then inside of a pair of foes into the far turn after that foe weakened, but dug in in upper
stretch, repelled those rivals passing the furlong pole, and drew off to win going away. GOOD GOOD was off slowly and bumped at at the start, raced far off
of the pace in the two path around the first turn, advanced in the four path down the backstretch before making a four wide bid for the lead into the far turn,
dueled outside of a pair of foes around that bend, but flattened out in upper stretch due to hanging on his left lead, was repelled by an inner foe at the
furlong pole, and prevailed for place. PERFECTLY MAJESTIC stalked the leading duelers from the three path, made a three wide bid for the lead between
horses into the far turn when GOOD GOOD forced her hand, dueled between foes around that bend, but hung on his left lead in upper stretch, and gave
way at the furlong pole. RUNMALIBURUN dueled for the lead inside of SHOBIZ STAR early on, but weakened into the far turn. OGEE'S EKATI raced far off
of the pace in the four path, and failed to factor. SWITHERAL was bumped and failed to factor. CAIRN bumped with foes on both sides at the start, then was
forwardly placed along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leaders into the far turn, and weakened.

Footnotes
R SOARING LIGHT prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead turning for home, and drew off passing the furlong pole under driving pressure.
BROOKVILLE DEPUTY was pinched between horses at the start, pulled between rivals through the early stages to set the pace, held an advantage inside
of R SOARING LIGHT around the turn, but was headed by that foe in upper stretch, and proved no match at the furlong pole before staying well clear of
show. HIGHEST PRAISE tracked keenly from midpack two wide, shifted outside of foes and advanced mildly in the four path around the turn, then stayed
on without threatening the leaders, and just held show. RED MOON MIKE saved ground far off of the pace, rallied while shifting three wide in midstretch,
then split foes in the final sixteenth with a late kick, but missed show on the wire. GLOWED broke outwards and bumped a foe at the start, raced off of the
pace two to three wide, and failed to factor. HANDFUL OF HALOS tracked from midpack in the three path, but was outmoved by HIGHEST PRAISE turning
for home, and subsequently faded. BAD ELMER was forwardly placed early on, but failed to keep pace with the leaders into the far turn, and further
weakened turning for home. RUAIRI bumped an inner foe at the start and never got involved.

Footnotes
HARBOR COURT set the pace two wide down the backstretch before inching clear into the turn, then held her margin through the lane under driving
pressure. SHOTGUN JOE broke in causing PRIVATE UNION to be pinched at the start, stalked three wide, came into the lane between horses as that foe
ranged up along side, but exchanged multiple bumps with that foe through the lane, and failed to make a bid on the leader. PRIVATE UNION was pinched
back at the start, tracked the pace from the three path, rallied four wide at the five sixteenths pole to make a bid for place at the quarter pole, but leaned in
on an inner foe turning for home, exchanged bumps with that rival through the lane, and was outdueled for place while failing to make a bid on the leader.
NEIGHBORLY was forwardly placed two wide between horses, cut the corner turning for home, but failed to produce a rail bid and faded. FLEETSTER was
off slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, shifted two wide turning for home, and rallied willingly. QUEST FOR GLORY raced far off of the pace four to
three wide and never got involved. GUARD was outrun along the inside. PLAY UP raced far off of the pace in the five to six path around the turn, and
weakend. GUNFIGHTERJUSTICE raced far off of the pace in the four to five path around the turn, and weakened. RILEY RICH oressed the pace setter
along the inside into the turn, but weakened turning for home, and stopped through the lane. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run
between SHOTGUN JOE and PRIVATE UNION, and also the start of SHOTGUN JOE. Neither incident was deemed sufficient to warrant action.

Footnotes
LADY LEAH held a loose lead down the backstretch, stayed clear through the far turn and upper stretch, then safely held under driving pressure. ROGUE
TOO stalked the loose leader along the inside, inched closer and forged place from outer foes while shifting off of the rail approaching the quarter pole, but
only produced mild rally while grinding away at the clear leader's margin, and held place while never truly threatening. THE BEAUTY'S TALE tracked from
midpack in the two path, waited for racing room passing the quarter pole, split foes while awkwardly tossing her head turning for home, and produced a mild
kick, but failed to threaten. HEAVEN ESCAPE saved ground far off of the pace, but waited for racing room behind traffic turning for home and through upper
stretch, shifted three wide at the furlong pole, and produced a mild kick on her left lead. SEEDS OF TIME took up mildly at the start costing her early
position, raced far off of the pace two wide while a bit keen around the first turn, then trailed in the three path around the far turn before passing tired foes in
the stretch. NATIVE LION tracked from midpack three to four wide around the turns, but drifted to the five path turning for home, and tired. INDIAN
FEATHER was forwardly placed two wide, but failed to keep pace with rivals on both sides into the far turn, then weakened on her left lead through the lane.
TAPIGAL was forwardly placed three wide, but failed to keep pace with an inner foe for place turning for home, and weakened.

Footnotes
TAP N SWAY set the pace along the inside, repelled TURN TO ME SUCREE's bid passing the quarter pole, drew off in upper stretch, and won going away
under driving pressure. VILLAREGGIA trailed around the turn, darted to the five path turning for home, and rallied outside of foes to get up for place in the
final sixteenth. BEAV'S BOO was reluctant to load, broke well but was eased back off of the pace after a furlong, saved ground far off of the pace, and
produced a rail rally in upper stretch, bid for place inside of foes inside the final furlong, but was outfinished by an outer rival. FLAT OUT APPEALING saved
ground from midpack, shifted three wide turning for home before rallying four wide and between horses in the final stages, but was outfinished for minor
rewards. SHE'S INTO ME chased the pace along the inside, shifted two then three wide in upper stretch, but failed to factor. TURN TO ME SUCREE
chased the pace setter three to two wide, inched closer at the five sixteenths pole, but was repelled at the quarter pole, then held place through midstretch,
but weakened between horses at the sixteenth pole. DIAMOND DAWN tracked from midpack two to four wide, but weakened. AUNTIE MABEL was done
early, and eased through the lane.

MAGINE saved ground far off of the pace, shifted to the six path through midstretch, then rallied in the late stages to just get up at the wire. GIFT
WRAPPED stalked the trio of duelers from along the inside, shifted to the three, then four path in upper stretch while inside of TWO SIXTYONE but behind
JE SUIS BELLE, was given racing room when the latter shifted a bit inwards, surged and bid for the lead at the sixteenth pole, forged an advantage, but was
nailed on the wire by an outer oncharging foe. JE SUIS BELLE dueled for the lead three wide, forged an advantage in upper stretch, but was headed by
multiple outer oncharging rivals at the sixteenth pole, yielded, and dead heated for show. TWO SIXTYONE stalked in the three to four path, inched closer
turning for home, but was outkicked by rivals on both sides at the sixteenth pole, then kept on to dead heat for show. DELICIOUS PURSUIT dueled for the
lead two wide and between horses, dug in to continue to vie in upper stretch, but yielded at the sixteenth pole. HEY NEGRITA trailed, swung to the five to
six path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. THAT'S GREAT raced off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and failed to factor. LUCKY FEVER
dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch. Per ruling received from the Indiana Horse Racing Commission
dated 11/09/200 (ruling 2227). DELICIOUS PURSUIT is dq'd due to a positive test.

Footnotes
A LITTLE IRRADIC steadied due to being rank between horses early on, trailed by a distance down the backstretch, took the turn in the five path before
shifting to the seven path while still trailing turning for home, then unleashed a flying charge outside of foes through the final furlong to get up at the wire.
GOOD SUGAR chased the loose leader four to three wide, produce a bid in upper stretch as that foe tired, forged an advantage at the furlong pole, but
continued to hang on his left lead in the late stages, and was worn down by an outer oncharging foe approaching the wire. DONT ASK KINMON tracked
from off of the pace in the four to five path, then produced a rally on his left lead through the lane, but was outkicked by an outer on charging rival before
staying on to achieve show. SON OF BATMAN hopped at the start, rushed to stalked position two wide and between horses, saved ground around the turn
after clearing an inner foe, shifted back two wide to pass the tiring pace setter at the furlong pole, but was outfinished by outer foes for minor rewards.
RAINY DAY DREAMIN raced far off of the pace two wide, shifted six wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor. COLONEL HUBERT set the pace, held a
clear margin in the two path around the turn, but hung on his left lead to the furlong pole, where he was headed, then wilted in the late stages.
CUZI'MHAPPY chased the pace from the two path, but weakened at the quarter pole. CUSTERS LAST STAND tracked from midpack three to two wide and
between horses, cut the corner turning for home, but failed to menace before being lightly urged behind traffic in the final sixteenth. KULMER raced off of
the pace along the inside, steadied hard in tight quarters at the seven sixteenths pole, then saved ground far off of the pace around the turn, waited behind
traffic in midstretch, then failed to produce a bid. EMPIRE'S SCORE bobbled at the start, tracked from midpack five to four wide, but weakened in upper
stretch while hanging on his left lead.

Footnotes
HURRICANE JAKE dueled for the lead inside of GET ALONG through a fast pace, dug in at the quarter pole as SUBDUED and SUGAR DOG FOX made
bids, dug in while being headed by those foes turning for home, fought back gamely to regain the lead passing the furlong pole, and held to the wire.
SUBDUED stalked the leading duelers along the inside, made a three wide bid for the lead between horses at the quarter pole forged a lead in upper
stretch, but hung and was outdueled by his inner foe through the late stages. SUGAR DOG FOX was caught four wide off of the pace around the first turn,
rallied four wide into and around the far turn to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, vied outside of a pair of foes in upper stretch, but hung and was repelled
by those rivals passing the furlong pole, then tired, but just held show. MANEUVERED raced far off of the pace two wide around both turns, waited for
racing room turning for home before splitting foes in upper stretch, shifted to the five path passing the furlong pole and rallied between foes in the late
stages, but just missed show. MR. SARCASTIC saved ground far off of the pace around the first turn, advanced three to five wide around the far turn, and
sustained a mild rally outside of foes through the lane but did not have enough to earn a minor reward. WORLD TAX WAR (IRE) tracked from midpack two
wide around the first turn, then three to four wide around the far turn, but failed to make an impact. THE STORY BEGINS saved ground in midpack,
steadied into the far turn, lost position and trailed the field turning for home while waiting behind traffic, then failed to menace. MAJESTIC JOHN'S was
forwardly placed two wide, but failed to make a bid before weakening at the furlong pole. GLORIOUS WEEKEND raced far off of the pace three wide, then
five to seven wide around the far turn, and failed to factor. DARKNSTORMYTIME raced far off of the pace two wide, then four to six wide around the far
turn, and failed to factor. GET ALONG dueled for the lead two wide through a fast pace, but was swallowed up by foes turning for home, and then eased
through the lane.
