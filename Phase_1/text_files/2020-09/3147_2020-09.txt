Footnotes
WMA SAND FLEE disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path on the turn, moved clear outside the five-sixteenths, responded well to the
challenge of the runner-up at the quarter-pole, shook off that foe into the final furlong and drew off under steady urging. HIGHH STICKING bumped with a
foe early, was urged along on the outside, advanced four then three wide on the turn, made a bid passing the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final
furlong and proved no match while well clear for the place. GOLLY SHEZ HOT SV was urged along off the pace and lacked the needed response while able
to get the show. CHAILLE steadied between foes then dropped back early, drifted to the far outside, went four to five wide on the turn and failed to threaten.
FLYINGJ GIDEON bumped with a rival early and was forced in, chased the pace, went three wide on the turn and came up empty. AA POCKIT ROCKIT
was ridden along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and also failed to repond. WMA GRAND CENTRAL bumped with a rival early, went around the
turn in the two path and failed to respond. HAFFIRS SIMONE disputed the pace on the outside of the winner, vied three wide on the turn, dropped back
nearing the five-sixteenths and stopped. RB DIVA broke in at the start, chased the pace, raced inside on the turn and retreated. MIRAGE AA came in at the
start, saved ground well out of contention and showed little. PISTOLINE was urged along on the far outside, dropped well behind late on the turn and
faltered. FRACTIONS WERE UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION
