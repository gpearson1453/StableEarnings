Footnotes
MATSON was outrun for a half mile, got fanned four wide while rallying on the second turn, drifted inward nearing mid stretch and briefly crowded GOLD N
GRAND then straightened and closed steadily to prevail. MY SUNSHINE contested the pace off the rail for six furlongs, met PREMIER LEAGUE'S bid in
mid stretch, dug in gamely but could not hold off the winner. PREMIER LEAGUE chased the leaders to the second turn, rallied three wide to get to terms
into the stretch, could not shake loose from MY SUNSHINE and hung late. GOLD N GRAND tracked the pace to the second turn, was two wide to the
stretch, shifted out for room then was forced to check briefly in mid stretch when crowded by the winner but finished gamely. AGENT ZERO had no speed,
settled to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch and had a mild late bid. INSANIAMANIA was allowed to settle mid pack, raced three wide to the
stretch but could not offer the needed late response. SWIFT CHANNEL had good speed, dueled from the rail for six furlongs then was outkicked in upper
stretch and tired. MULZOFF was five wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn then was caught four wide while rallying to the stretch but could not
sustain that bid and weakened. IRISH OUTLAW stalked the leaders two wide to the second turn then saved ground to no avail. ROYALLY BIG trailed
througout.

DENNIS CELERY was unhurried to the half, advanced inside on the second turn, pushed to the front in mid stretch and drove clear. SOONER THAN
SOONER pressed the leader to the second turn, offered a bid three wide but was outkicked by the winner to the stretch then was tiring but had enough of a
cushion to save the place. FATHER O'FLAHERTY hesitated then hopped at the start and lost about five lengths to begin, trailed to the second turn, shifted
out in the drive and was making up ground belatedly. DEALERS HAND was rank going to the first turn, settled on the backstretch, raced two then three wide
to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. THE HENRIETTA hustled to the front, set the pace to the second turn then was overtaken and gave out in the
stretch.

NICE AND TRUE had good speed, dueled two wide to the stretch, responded to inch away to mid stretch then pushed clear to the line. LIS LA VICTOIRE
attended the pace outside the winner, was three wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch but gamely saved the place. TIGER'S PRINCESS
broke a bit slow and was rushed up into contention, stalked from the rail to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. FRENCH TUDOR was
outsprinted to the turn, came two wide to the stretch then did not threaten but just missed the show. SPIRIT LAKE had no speed, saved ground on the turn
but could only pick off rivals in the drive. LOST FREEDOM got outsprinted to the turn, was caught four wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch
and weakened. SPICEY N HAPPY had no speed and was not a factor. ROCKER CHIC attended the pace outside two others and three wide to mid turn
then tired.

Footnotes
FANTASTIC ARAGORN had no speed, settled to the half, circled five wide while rallying on the second turn, continued to respond in the drive and was clear
late. INDIAN HEAD NICKLE had the best speed, set the pace to the second turn, was collared while saving ground to the stretch but dug in determinedly
and got the nod over VASTLY DEEP for the place. VASTLY DEEP pressed the pace to the second turn, bid three wide to engage INDIAN HEAD NICKLE
for the lead, battled through a long stretch run then was outfinished for the win and missed second. GEM STATE checked off heels into the first turn, stalked
the pace to the half, came two wide to the stretch, rallied to also engage for the lead in mid stgretch then battled on but was bested. BIG IMPRESSION
tracked the pace to the second turn, bid four wide to the stretch but lacked the needed closing response. AERIAL DECOY broke a bit slow, had no speed
and was not a factor. UR NOT MY PRESIDNT was outsprinted, settled for a half mile, was two wide on the second turn but also was never a threat.
