Footnotes
IRON TUFF broke on top and quickly prompted the pace from outside, edged clear four wide on the turn, extended the advantage under steady handling.
MOLLY DENALI broke a step slowly, moved off the inside entering the turn in the three path and soon shifting out six wide on that bend, got up for second
over ELECTRICK COUNTY, who chased off the leaders outside, went five wide on the turn, lost place late. SASSY KITTY broke outwardly and exchanged
bumps with a rival, went in the two path on the turn in behind the leaders, needed more late. RAIN MAGIC pressed the pace from inside, weakened in the
stretch. RAZORBACK HONEY vied for the lead inside the eventual winner but off the rail in the three path, weakened in the stretch. TIZ MY HOUR broke in
and exchanged bumps at the start, went five wide into the turn and was floated eight deep on that bend, failed to threaten. RED RHUMBA was bumped
around at the break from both sides, went four then floated seven wide on the turn and failed to threaten.

tracked from between runners, went three to four wide on the turn and was asked at the quarter pole, ran on belatedly but missed. LAKE MARY pressed
inside the winner but off the rail, was mostly in the two to three path through the turn, had no extra late. TERAS SILENCE raced outside the second group
four to five wide on the turn and failed to rally. TAMMY'S SHADOW chased inside, weakened. J P GLUXX shifted out past the three-eighths going mostly

Footnotes
GETTY tracked from inside, prompted the issue taking the lead at the seven-sixteenths after moving up along the rail, was headed at the top of the stretch
but dug in and was resurgent late. LEADING PROSPECT stalked four wide, bid leaving the far turn, took a narrow lead in upper stretch but was outfinished.
HUSH'S STORM settled mid-pack inside a rival racing on or just off the rail, continued to save ground on the far turn, captured show honors while no match
for the top pair. DAJUDGE pressed from outside three wide, ratcheted up the pressure a bid midway up the backstretch still outside, went three deep on the
far turn and weakened in the drive. TOX shifted in heading into the first turn in behind the leaders three wide and outside a foe, moved out and advanced
some five wide on the far turn but could not sustain the effort in the lane. GOLD NOTE saved ground inside through both turns, came out in upper stretch
and ran on evenly. GERDA'S GONE broke a bit awkwardly and lacked early speed racing off the inside, went in the six path on the far turn and passed tired
rivals. KARAOKE CAT set the early pace from off the rail, was between rivals and pressured from the seven-sixteenths to the three-sixteenths and came up
empty thereafter. QUANTICO JOE switched out early, went two to three wide on the turns and was never a threat.

Footnotes
LUCKY FLASH attended the pace from outside, entered the turn four deep then shifted in to be near the rail past the quarter pole and edging away, was
well clear into upper stretch and held safe. SELL BABY SELL brushed a foe very lightly at the start, settled just off the pace, went four then five wide on the
turn and was second best. FEISTY HALO brushed the outer foe just lightly at the start, raced just off the leaders, went in the two path on the turn and
improved position inside. WE OUTTA HERE was within range early, went five to four wide on the turn and failed to rally. CURRENTLYMYPROBLEM set the
early tempo just off the rail, continued in the two path through the turn before coming out leaving that bend, weakened thereafter. TWENTYFOUR K CAT
was lightly brushed at the start, chased in behind going three then four wide on the turn swinging eight deep into upper stretch. THOUGHT I'DMISSYOU
was up close early racing inside but failed to threaten late.
