Footnotes
MS LYNN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and wore down LIBERTY'S
FINALE in the closing yards. LIBERTY'S FINALE was bumped at the start, stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, gained command nearing the quarter,
drifted out slightly in the stretch, opened a clear margin but could not hold the winner safe late. FRANKS FIX IT broke out, dueled for the lead while racing
three-wide and gave way grudgingly in the drive. SLEW'S LEGACY was bumped at the break, disputed the pace from the inside and gave way after going a
half. XIMENA'S HONOR showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and failed to menace.
SHADY DRIFTER lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MISTER FIRE bobbled at the start, raced unhurried early,
moved four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
SECRET PARANOIA was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, waited for racing room approaching the stretch, forged to the front into the lane and
drew off quickly as the handiest of winners. STREETLIGHTROMANCE lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch, could
not gain on the winner but was clearly second best. Z'S SPERANZA settled off the leaders early, advanced five-wide through the turn and finished with a
steady bid. SWISS SKIMMER chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. BELL OF RAINIER lagged early, raced
four-wide through the turn, lacked room in mid-stretch and finished willingly when clear. CATE'S GOLD was away in good order to stalk the leaders while
racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, gained a slight edge and weakened. ROSIES BABY broke sharply to dispute the pace from
between foes and weakened after going a half. GOLDIE'S DARLINS dueled for the lead from off the rail and weakened after a half.

Footnotes
TRIBAL IMPACT was never far back, raced three-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear. TRUE REGARDS was away
in good order to open a clear margin before going a quarter, remained in control into the stretch but could not match strides with the winner through the final
furlong. RIGGSKI lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the eighth pole and finished evenly. CODE CHARLIE steadied from
the five-eighths marker to the three-eighths pole, saved ground through the turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. COLT FIFTY SEVEN
chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. MAGIC MAHOGANY settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the
turn and weakened. ROUGH RIDE bobbled at the start, rushed to contend, pressed the pace while racing three-wide for three-eighths and weakened.

Footnotes
LINCHPINS WAKE stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with SIGRID'S GOLD through a prolonged
drive and proved best. NATIONAL HEROINE broke slow and inward then rushed up to be reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for
the drive and finished with good energy to just miss. SIGRID'S GOLD set a pressured pace from off the rail, responded when challenged by the winner
approaching the stretch, vied with that foe and gave way grudgingly late. O'S SO SERIOUS dwelt, raced unhurried early, angled out into the stretch and
finished with some late run. SALSA VERDE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. BABY ROCKS stumbled at
the start, was allowed to settle early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was not a factor. THECHAMPISFLORING
was away in good order to press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. JADEY AT THE BAR raced off the pacesetters early,
moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
MIRROR IMAGE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the nine-sixteenths pole, responded when
challenged by AWESOME SLATE nearing the five-sixteenths pole, then repelled the bid of SHIFTY DANCER in mid-stretch and was all out to hold off the
resurging AWESOME SLATE late. AWESOME SLATE raced five-wide through the first turn, then settled just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through
the second turn, reached the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with that rival, dropped back in mid-stretch and came back to just miss. SHIFTY
DANCER pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, moved inside into the stretch, offered a bid with a furlong to run and gave way late.
CHRISTINE'S JACK raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. GRAY ADMIRAL settled off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the second turn and did not menace. PAPA DO RUN pressed the pace while racing four-wide for three furlongs and weakened.

COASTAL KID settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, drifted in to bump rival while taking
command with a furlong to run and quickly drew off when straightened away. NAVAL ESCORT was reserved just off the leaders from between foes, moved
three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. MYUDDERMAMASAPAINT lacked early speed, checked nearing the three-eighths pole, moved
four-wide through the turn, angled in and out through the lane and finished well when clear. KOWBOYKABIN pressed the pace from between foes, was
bumped in mid-stretch and gave way. ADJUDGED settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, reached a striking position, checked
and lost best chance. COASTAL JAZZ was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths
pole, was bumped with a furlong to run and gave way. TRUTH TO POWER hopped at the start, raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the turn and
was not a factor. FALSELY ACCUSED broke in and steadied, lagged early, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention. FOREVER GOLD
pressed the pace while racing four-wide for a half and weakened. STEAL HOME settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and
gradually weakened. HOUSE OF LORDS was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CHEROKEE LOUISE was reserved just off the leaders from off the rail, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and held off the closing
CONSTANT CRAVING by a diminishing margin. CONSTANT CRAVING lacked early speed, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out and back inside
in mid-stretch, rallied and just missed. TIGER MOM broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing four-wide, angled out into the stretch and finished
willingly. PERFECT PROMISE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, drifted out into the stretch and gave way through the final
furlong. SIERRA SUNRISE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. PIN UP LADY broke in the air, raced unhurried early,
moved from off the rail through the turn and did not offer a bid. IKNOWYOURFACE raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and
gradually weakened.

LICORICE DROP POPS stalked the pace of DAYTONA BEACH while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a sixteenth to run and drew clear.
DAYTONA BEACH was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths pole and yielded to the winner
through the final sixteenth. BERNIE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. CATS CHAMP
broke sharply to press the pace of DAYTONA BEACH while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. KALAKALA lacked early speed, steadied
nearing the three-eighths pole and did not menace thereafter.

nearing the three-sixteenths marker and finished willingly. WINDRIBBON broke sharply then raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
turn and finished evenly late. OH MARVELOUS ME settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. WINE AT NINE
showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. RALLY CAT lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not

furlongs, re-cleared into the stretch and drew off while being ridden out. VICTORY COMMAND settled off the leaders from off the rail, angled out
approaching the stretch, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. AUNTIE CHIANTI raced off the pacesetters early, moved
four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. CALYPSO QUEEN broke out and stumbled, chased the winner while racing four-wide, moved up
to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths pole and weakened through the lane. I C FIRE lagged throughout.
