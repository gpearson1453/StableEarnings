advanced on the far turn, was swung five wide and offered a bid. FOR ME LET IT BE outpaced early, moved closer on the turn and stayed on in the stretch.
BAYOUADRINK forced the pace, dueled on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. NEW GOSPEL raced forwardly while four wide and weakened.

DEBATING settled while three wide, advanced on the turn, moved four wide into the stretch and rallied. PYSER'S ORB chased the pacesetter, took over
leaving the turn and was no match late. CHANGING LANES outpaced, commenced his bid on the turn and finished well. BAUDETTE BLIZZARD failed to
threaten. TOP OF THE ROCK was always outrun. PAY DIRT dueled early, was headed leaving the turn and gave way. NORTH SIDE forced the pace and
weakened.
