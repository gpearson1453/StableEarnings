Footnotes
FLASHYBOY BOBB stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded to gain a clear margin at the eighth pole and
held sway. RICHARD RONALD chased the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, altered outside, responded and was getting to the
winner late. ALMA DERBY forced the early pace from the outside, remained forward for the drive, responded and was up for the show. DISAPPROVAL
chased the early pace from the inside but could not keep pace. COMBAT COMMAND forced the early pace from the inside, made a bid entering the drive
but was too late. SEE CARLOS RUN broke sharp from the inside, gained a clear early margin, remained clear through the turn then faded in the drive.
BAND BOSS was no real factor. WHISKEY'S GONE was no threat. KENAI STAR was never a menace. HOLY SUNRISE forced the early pace outside and
faded. G CISIVE was never close. HORACE CHARLES showed little. Five eighths split time unavailable duel to a timer malfunction.

FIRE broke sharp from between foes, gained a clear early margin, remained clear through the turn, dueled with the winner through the drive but could not
match strides. ADIEU LE CHAT pressed the early pace outside, advanced through the turn, responded and was along for the show. SCAMPERING
GRAYCE chased the early pace inside, remained forward but came up empty in the drive. HICCUP was crowded at the start and finished belatedly.
WICKED FITZ stumbled at the start, was five wide up the backstretch and tired. OUT MAKING TREBLE hopped at the start and was no factor.
MULTIDIMENSIONAL was no threat. NO CUSSING was six wide up the backstretch and faded. BUGGER RED was never close. HONORARIAN was six
wide up the backstretch, chased the pace and tired. HALEYS SAILOR chased the early pace, made a bid but was too late

Footnotes
BALLYHACK up close early from the outside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded entering the drive, gained the margin at the eighth pole and
just lasted late. STORM CLASSIC broke sharp from between foes, gained a clear early margin, dueled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the
second turn, held a forward position in the drive but could not match strides. WILLY SPECIAL CATS stalked the early pace from the outside, advanced
through the second turn, responded but could only hold the show. ELIJAH GHOST unhurried early from the inside, made a bid entering the second turn but
was too late. MAX PANDOWDY went evenly. MAYAN GHOST forced the early pace from the inside, dueled up the backstretch then faded in the drive.
UNBRIDLED SHOES could only pass tired ones. WICKED REBEL pressed the early pace inside and tired. OPLIN was never close. WILDFIRE STORM
was no menace. One mild split time unavailable due to a timer malfuchtion.

outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded and closed with a rush for the place. BAYOU BODE stalked the early pace outside, steadily
advanced through the turn, responded but could only hold the show. FRIENDLYPRODUCTION unhurried early from the outside, advanced through the turn,
responded and had a late rally. BROADWAY JONES could only improve position. DIXIE STREET chased the early pace inside but came up empty in the
drive. GEM OF CARLOS forced the early pace and tired. SEELEY pressed the early pace inside and faded. LILRASCALMAN was no factor.
