assumed command entering the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, and finished from along the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best.
PERFECT COMMAND away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and
finished one out from the rail in the drive to prove best of the rest. ACCEPT NO OTHER stalked the dueling leaders from along the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied from just off the rail entering he final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive while unable to seriously threaten. ZOOMZOOM

CASH IN COMMAND broke sharply and vied fort he lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down

OUREVELADY tracked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained her position in the run down the
backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and finished determinedly four wide in the drive to prove best. MORI GIRL broke sharply and
pressed the pace two wide entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue one out from the rail in the run down the backside, assumed
control entering the final turn, but was unable to fend off OUREVELADY late, while proving easily second best. SIMPLY GOLDEN unhurried early while
dropping back to trail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, and finished well to get up for a share. YOU GOT THIS
away alertly and stalked the leaders one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from
the rail in the drive. CAPE LITE away well and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the lane the first time, set a pressured pace to the
final turn, before weakening. CONVERGENT stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing two wide from between rivals in deep stretch.

Footnotes
WANDALITA away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, collared the
pacesetter in mid stretch and quickly inched clear. BAYAKOAS IMAGE broke sharply and raced to the lead entering he first turn, appeared to jump a
shadow soon after entering he backstretch, dictated the pace in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was no match for the winner in deep
stretch, but battled gamely to prove clearly second best. TOUGH TEXAN away well and tracked the leader from along the rail entering the backstretch,
rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. BROAD APPROVAL tracked the leaders into the first turn while
racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed one out from the rail in the drive to prove best of the rest. SUNGOLD
BEAUTY settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from
along the rail in the stretch drive. MUD POET unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, but failed
to make a late impact. SNOWSHOES settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the
final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. BRALORNE settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the
backstretch, bore out when something went amiss in the run to the final turn, was pulled up midway through the final turn, and was vanned off.

the final turn, and had nothing to offer late. REPRIMAND was fractious in the gate prior to the start, but was away well and chased the leader through the

Footnotes
BAKZONE away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, briefly awaited
room midway through the turn, tipped four wide leaving the turn and took control entering the lane and drew clear late. THE KAT'S BACK away alertly and
tracked the leader two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, held a narrow advantage leaving the turn,
but was no match for the winner late, but finished willingly one out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. BLUEBERRY HONEY settled well
off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the rail through the final turn, and closed
willingly two out from the rail in the drive to prove best of the rest. TOBESUNNY rushed up from along the rail to vie for the lead entering the first turn, set a
pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn, and had little to offer late. STAR CLASSIC broke
sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide into the final turn, was overtaken leaving
the turn, and faded in the late stages. REIGNS DREAMZ unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed
to make a late impact. NANOOK stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, raced three wide into the final turn, but weakened
over the final furlong.
