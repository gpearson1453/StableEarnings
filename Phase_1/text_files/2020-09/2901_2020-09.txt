FAST MASTER saved ground stalking the pace, hugged the rail when taking the lead entering the stretch and drew clear under steady handling. BRUTUS
set the pace in the two path around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, raced on his left lead and weakened. GIRLS LOVE ME stalked the pace down the
backstretch, dropped back on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch, rallied and drifted in a bit late. COOKE BROTHERS chased the pace between
horses on the turn, swung wide leaving the bend, drifted in near the eighth pole and gave way. VICTORY GIVEN rushed up five deep leaving the
backstretch, chased the pace, circled the turn and faltered. VOODOO VALLEY dropped back on the turn.

Footnotes
COOL HAND COOP drafted back off the leaders and tracked towards the inside, eased out three wide mid turn, moved up under pressure into the lane,
drew alongside POLAR BEAR PETE in mid stretch, dueled under strong handling, gained a slim lead inside the sixteenth marker and held firm. POLAR
BEAR PETE had speed inside rivals then shook clear into the turn, remained close to the rail while setting the pace, dug in when confronted nearing the
eighth pole, took a bad step in deep stretch, gave way grudgingly, was pulled up about three sixteenths through the gallop out and was vanned off after
sustaining an injury to his right front. TAUBER , bumped at the break, raced off the pace while racing in the clear, was under a ride mid turn, raced three
wide into the lane and had a mild rally. GOLAZO , three deep forcing the early pace, chased two wide into the lane and faded. BACKWOODS BOOGIE
stumbled at the break, recovered to spar between runners early on, pursued two wide around the turn then faded in the final sixteenth. FAIR CATCH ,
bumped at the break, gave early chase four wide but failed to keep pace. SCORCHED BY FIRE , in tight and bumped at the break, dropped back. SAGE
CANYON dropped well off the pace, raced wide under rating into the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
KWIST bumped HELMS DEEP when coming out at the break, sped to the early lead, saved ground on the turn, was in the two path turning for home and
dug in tenaciously to prevail. GOLDEN GULLEY saved ground on the turn, hugged the inner rail through the stretch and rallied gamely. ALPHA QUEUE
prompted the pace outside the winner and faded. MARKET CAP circled foes on the turn, was four deep entering the stretch and gave way. HELMS DEEP
broke slowly, bumped with IRISH SNOW after being bumped by KWIST soon after the break, steadied behind horses leaving the backstretch, eased out
mid way on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and retreated. IRISH SNOW bumped with HELMS DEEP soon after the break, raced along the
inner rail most of the trip and retreated through the stretch. BUDDY REVELL trailed. An objection by the owner of HELMS DEEP against the winner for
alleged interference leaving the starting gate was not allowed.

Footnotes
FIFTEEN ROYALS was nudged clear soon after the break, dictated the pace, raced two wide into the lane, opened up a commanding advantage in mid
stretch and won under a steady hand ride. MAE SAI PRINCESS , taken to rate, saved ground into the lane and finished up willingly to be clear for the place.
A GIRL NAMED JAC chased to the inside of a rival, angled three wide into the lane and faded in the final seventy yards. LITTLE LION GIRL , well back,
swung six wide for the drive but lacked a serious response. MARKET MONEY pursued the early pace three wide and gave way. SPLASHERSTOWN gave
hard chase racing outside a rival, remained in range to upper stretch then gave way.

GROUP TEXT stalked the pace, hugged the inner rail around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch, gained the lead inside the sixteenth pole
and was edging away late. BLUE SKY VENEZUELA , well placed outside horses down the backstretch, was four deep approaching the stretch and rallied
outside. SWIRRLIE SHIRLIE sprinted clear in the three path mid way on the turn and weakened late. JOYFUL NOISE saved ground on the turn, swung to
the six path in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. PETION LASS lacked speed, was fanned to the seven path in upper stretch and failed to be a
factor. LADY ROZINA was outrun. COSITA RICA sped to the early lead, raced in the two path around the turn and faltered in upper stretch.

CERULEAN SPRINGS prompted the pace three wide outside SOMEKINDOFMAGICIAN, came under a ride mid turn while drawing on near even terms,
dueled while being floated out past the three sixteenths, gained a narrow advantage soon after, dug in when confronted from his outside, kept on under
strong encouragement and grimly prevailed. TOUGHEST 'OMBRE rated close up, shifted five wide into the lane, ranged up very wide and outside the
leading pair in mid stretch, battled head to head through the final furlong and just missed. SOMEKINDOFMAGICIAN sped to the front early on, set the pace
off the inside, was put to asking leaving the half mile pole, dueled from mid turn, wandered outward leaving the quarter pole, stayed on to mid stretch and
weakened. BALLIVOR broke a step slow, advanced inside leaving the three quarter pole, failed to keep pace while under pressure into the lane and gave
way.

Footnotes
GOODLUCKCHUCK , under firm rating while towards the inside leaving the five eighths, was patiently mid turn, moved up along the rail nearing the furlong
marker, shifted out and leveled off under right handed rousing, reeled in the leader with about forty yards remaining and was drawing away. TO THE
FRONT had speed outside rivals and went clear heading to the turn, set the pace three wide into the lane, swerved inward when put to the right stick leaving
the three sixteenths, corrected to remain clear past mid stretch, failed to contain the winner but continued well to the line. NO FOOLING DUDE had speed to
lead early on, ceded to TO THE FRONT nearing the half mile marker, chased between rivals into the lane and kept on with interest. CLASSY SOLUTION
dropped back after an alert start, saved ground while well back past the three eighths, remained inside while under a drive into the lane and rallied. NAZCA
MYSTERY was steadied in the opening furlong, recovered and was sent between runners to get a chasing spot, came four wide for the drive and
weakened. CONFUSION BABY BOY , four wide early, pursued three wide mid turn and weakened. KATHAK , off slowly when bobbling, was brushed as
well and failed to recover.
