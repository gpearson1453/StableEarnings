GRAY'S FABLE stalked the pace, moved off the rail at the top of the stretch, rallied gamely and was up late under a driving. STRIKE ME DOWN stalked two
and three-wide, closed into the stretch, bid quickly, drove clear but failed to hold the winner safe. CLEAR DESTINATION was rated off the pace, closed hard
late turn, angled out in the stretch then finished determinedly. KINGLY sprinted clear quickly, set a reserved pace, dueled into the stretch, yielded mid
stretch and gave chase. MALIBU UPROAR was rated off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn then came running late. WEDGEWOOD raced
in mid pack, closed into the turn, bid late turn, dueled, but gave way upper stretch. THOR'S ROCKET, in mid pack early, came three-wide through the turn
but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
MUM'S THE WORD, rated in range, came two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, led a furlong out and widened under light handling. CARPE
HORSESHOE, off slowly, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, was blocked at the top of the stretch, found a seam and rallied gamely.
KOTO forced the pace from the rail, bid late turn, dueled, gained a short lead in the stretch but was passed with a furlong to run. OSTRACIZE, steadied at
the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then rallied from the outside. MUSICAL RIDE set a pressured pace, was engaged
late turn, dueled, was squeezed back by MUM'S THE WORD mid stretch and chased to the end. ADMIRING settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on
the turn but never reached contention. NORTHERN CROSS broke outward then settled off the pace, came from the rail to three-wide through the turn,
chased into the stretch but failed to menace. WAR EMPRESS showed brief speed, pressed the pace, chased three and four-wide on the turn but evened
out mid stretch. HI HONEY stalked the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn then flattened out upper stretch. RACONTER raced in mid pack, was hustled
on the turn but had no closing response. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE TRAINER OF MUSICAL RIDE AGAINST MUM'S THE WORD FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING MUSICAL RIDE AND MUM'S THE WORD IN THE STRETCH
LEFT THE RESULTS UNCHANGED.
