GUILTYWITHANEXCUSE pressed two wide outside the early leader, dueled on even terms with that one through the lane and prevailed. MISS
DILLINGHAM had position three wide, vied outside the winner through the lane and wasn't quite enough. IZZADORA BELLA steadied along the inside early
on the backstretch, came out into the three path, lagged into the stretch and gained late between the top two. AMIGOS TUNE made the early pace along
the rail while inside the winner and faded in late stretch. TANYA'S GEM steadied, came in on IZZADORA BELLA at the five-eighths pole, continued to
chase the leaders into the turn then weakened. ATTENTIVELY went in the air in the gate, raced the four path and failed to matter.

MASTERFUL TOUCH was rated early in the two path, began a three wide run into the far turn, was carried wide into the stretch while vying for command
then drew away under mild urging. GOLDFORTHENEWYEAR opened a clear lead soon after the break, stayed out from the inside, ran out entering the
stretch and weakened. CLASSY SOLUTION had early position along the rail, was sent to vie inside the early leader before a half, drifted out in early stretch
and outfinished tired ones for the show. SOUL FIGHT was bumped leaving the gate, was unhurried, made a run in the three path into the far turn, moved
closer in early stretch, was eased up, lost the show and finished in a dead heat for fourth. DUE GEMELLI ducked in sharply leaving the gate, bumped SOUL
FIGHT, then was no factor and finished even for fourth. BLOOD RUNNER was outrun. A T M AWESOME chased the pace for about five furlongs, stopped
and was eased up through the lane.
