Footnotes
BIFF was rated wide around the first turn, moved three wide to command midway on the final turn then drew away under mild urging. VISHNU ducked in
sharply leaving the gate, moved to a short lead from the outside nearing the end of the backstretch then tired. WHERE'S THE BEN'S had position along the
rail for over three-quarters then tired. CRUISE CONTROL was outrun. E T'S WARRIOR chased the early leader two wide and was finished after five
furlongs. LITHOGRAPHER made the pace for over a half, stopped and was eased up. NOTHING YET broke slowly and fell far back.
