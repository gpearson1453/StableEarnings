Footnotes
TRIPLE MALT broke well from the gate then tracked the pace set by FUNNY FLOWERS to he half-mile pole, commenced bid between foes on the far turn
and dug in through the stretch drive under strong right-handed urging to edge away late. FUNNY FLOWERS was away from the gate well to set the early
pace on the inside, led the field under confident handling to the quarter pole, lost the lead exiting the far turn and finished willingly on the inside to edge
HERECITYKITTY for place. HERECITYKITTY hopped slightly out of the gate then tracked the early pace three wide to the half, continued three wide into
the far turn then advanced to take the lead into the stretch, drifted out slightly under left handed urging then flattened out in the lane. SHOT OF WINE was
allowed to settle inside in the second flight through the opening half, continued inside into the stretch and finished evenly but had no late kick. SUMMER
LOVIN settled back three wide in the second flight and proved no factor late. GYPSY WIND tracked three wide in the first flight, shifted inside down the
backstretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
SNEEKY DIVERSION broke outwards bumping a rival, was urged between foes to join the pace racing into the bend, went clear midway through the turn
and was kept to firm encouragement to widen the advantage. RUNAWAY READY broke readily, prompted the pace three wide into the turn, couldn't match
the winner racing through the turn but proved best of the others. DARLA'S BIG BOY, in touch with the leaders along the rail in the opening stages, was
eased off the pace to track along the inside racing into the bend, switched outside a rival arcing into upper stretch and displayed some late interest to prevail
for a share. SR. BOM BON broke readily, disputed the pace inside foes into the turn, couldn't match the top pair after the opening quarter and gave way into
the lane. SHAKELAS DESTINY settled between foes early, angled to the inside on the turn but lacked a rally. HISMUDDAWASAMUDDA, bumped at the
start, dropped out early.

Footnotes
KID'S INHERITANCE broke inwards, was righted to track off the first flight outside foes, steadily gained contention three wide between foes after a half, was
prompted to challenge in that path leaving the far turn, shifted inwards under pressure but went clear. GUN WAR, urged to the lead along the inside
disputing the pace, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch to the far turn but proved no match late. STAY MY FAYVORITE was rated
along the stalking just off the first flight, saved ground to upper stretch and continued evenly while prevailing for a share. ROYALLY DECORATED tracked
the leaders between foes in second flight, shifted out three wide racing into the lane but had no late kick. GABRIEL'S LEGEND exchanged bumps at the
break, then was caught in tight at the start, settled last to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into the lane but made no impact. ICYWILBURNYEH
ducked out at the start, was urged between rivals prompting the pace into the backstretch, then through the far turn, gave way racing into upper stretch.
READS LANDING exchanged bumps at the start, was collected while shifting out four wide racing to the backstretch to make some brief progress but gave
way racing into the far turn. ROVERTON angled inside early but failed to menace.

Footnotes
KIMBERLY FRANCES, bumped soundly at the start, angled quickly to the rail racing into the first turn, saved ground throughout steadily drawing into
striking distance nearing upper stretch and came through inside foes to wrest the advantage and hold HOMELAND MESSA under strong handling. The
latter broke outwards bumping the eventual winner, was righted to track off the first flight from out of striking distance, was prompted to advance while being
fanned four wide nearing the lane and continued to dispute the issue outside the winner while just outkicked. BEVOLUTION, urged along the inside dictating
the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, disputed the issue inside a rival into the far turn, dueled between foes into upper stretch and weakened
late. SON OF POSEIDON, urged prompting a rival's pace in early stages, pressed the issue between foes on the far turn into the lane and gave way. ALOO
GHOST settled between foes dropping off the second flight and never gained contention. HERO OF FIRE settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and
failed to menace.

Footnotes
EXTRA GORGEOUS tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight in the opening half, drew into contention in the two path racing into the lane, split
foes to bid inside the leaders leaving midstretch and edged forward under firm handling. SILVERA, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter in the
opening half, pressed the issue between foes through the far turn, was carried out in upper stretch but continued with a grudging effort to prevail for the
place honors. BADGERI CANDY tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival in the opening half, advanced to press the issue three wide on the far turn,
was carried out to the five path in upper stretch but continued willingly outside the top pair to dispute the issue to late stages. FRANCES ANNA sprinted to
the lead racing to the first turn, angled to the rail setting the pace, dueled inside foes into the far turn, shifted well off the rail racing into upper stretch and
gave out leaving midstretch. SAPPHIRE JUBILEE settled last early, angled out four wide in the lane but made no impact. CATTY KRYS angled to the inside
tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, saved ground to the lane and faded in the drive. PASZ THE PEPPER tracked off the second flight along
the inside and came up empty on the far turn. DIM SUM settled outside foes to the backstretch and failed to menace.

DIVA DE KELA was prompted to a forward placing along the rail in the opening stages, tracked just off the leaders along the inside racing into the turn,
saved ground into upper stretch, came through inside LUCKY LORRETTA when presented an opening to challenge for command midstretch and edged
forward of that foe in the final stages under firm right handed pressure. The latter was urged between foes, then inside rivals disputing the pace into the turn,
edged forward into upper stretch while shifting off the rail, resisted the winner to late stages but proved only second best. WINNAGER tracked just off the
first flight three deep between foes, advanced in that path nearing upper stretch, was fanned four wide late but continued with interest to just miss for
second. FORTY NINE MODEL, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset to upper stretch, weakened late. RENTAL POOL tracked off the
second flight outside rivals racing to the turn, was prompted to advance while being fanned six wide into upper stretch but continued with mild interest to
improve position. LILFEATHEREDINDIAN tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn, shifted out to race five wide between foes nearing
upper stretch and continued evenly late. TAILORBESWIFT, off slowly, was settled last well off the field and passed inside some tiring rivals late. ALL
NATIVE retreated early. THERIGHTTOBEARARMS, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the first flight to the turn, faded between foes into the lane.

Footnotes
TIME FOR KISSES, urged inside rivals to a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, switched outside that foe nearing upper stretch
while continuing with a steady bid and took over late under firm encouragement. LIL B QUICK joined the pace four, then three wide in the opening stages,
was urged forward while angling to the rail racing through the backstretch, set the pace along the inside into the lane but couldn't contain the winner's final
bid. SAUCY AT MIDNIGHT tracked the leaders four wide as part of the second flight in early stages, was prompted to advance three wide nearing upper
stretch but lacked the needed late kick. A KISS GOODNIGHT, off slowly, was settled last early, swung out five wide nearing the lane, then continued to
improve position while shifting inwards under pressure. REMARKABLE CHARM, off a step slowly, angled to the inside tracking off the second flight, saved
ground to upper stretch and continued evenly. SEYNATAWNEE flashed brief pace between foes in the opening furlong and faded early. FABLES LOVE
AFFAIR tracked the leaders three deep between foes in the opening quarter but dropped out early. PONTIFICATOR, urged between foes pursuing the
pacesetter into the turn, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
TANGO'S KITTY, forwardly placed four wide in the opening stages, was prompted to advance on the pacesetter while shifting in sharply racing into the turn,
moved to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, drifted out while being roused to resist the challenge of AIR WALKER and held that foe to the end
under firm right handed encouragement. The latter tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening stages, advanced on the leaders three wide
through the bend, was floated out racing into upper stretch and couldn't gain even terms with the winner. U S S LOIS, held up when shuffled out of tight
quarters at the start, settled into stride, split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch and prevailed for a share. LAURA N LUKAS, forwardly placed
three wide between foes tracking just off the pacesetter, steadied out of tight quarters nearing the three furlong marker and faded into the lane. KARMA
REIGNS switched just off the rail while being urged in pursuit of the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, was taken in hand avoiding tight quarters
nearing the three furlong marker and soon gave way. FAIRY SURPRISE sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside, set the pace on a narrow advantage
racing into the turn and gave way abruptly entering upper stretch.
