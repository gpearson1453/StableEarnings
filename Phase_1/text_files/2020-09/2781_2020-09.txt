GONE TO BE BRIGHT emerged the leader into the first turn, drew away at the head of the stretch and was kept to task. BIG HOSS ROLLIN out sprinted to
the turn, loomed boldly at the top of the lane but was unable to reach the winner and held sway. FREE THOUGHT fanned four wide into the turn, was
unable to move on with the pacesetters leaving the final turn and lodged a mild rally to earn show honors. SS FROSTY trailed the field and showed some
interest late. LAST UNICORN hustled three wide into the opening turn and faded inside through the stretch.

Footnotes
THIN LINE led the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, continued to show the way down the stretch holding off all challenges. LONG
TIME DON sat mid pack between rivals, coaxed through the final turn, loomed boldly into the stretch but was unable to stall the winner while finishing
evenly. CHISUM G sat just off the pace, rallied three wide into the stretch and held for show. REMARKABLE VINTAGE tracked the field outside, advanced
outside into the lane and improved position slightly in the stretch while never threatening. AWESOME ANTHONY saved ground inside, advanced along the
rail leaving the backstretch taking closer order and lacked the rally needed into the stretch. MR. IRRELEVANT trailed the field and showed some interest
late. SUPER INDIAN (FR) vied three wide into the backstretch, drifted out soon after, dropped back coming out of the final turn and tired.

Footnotes
MOON AMOUR broke quickly then sprinted clear entering the turn, came under some light pressure at the head of the stretch and was steadily encouraged
down the lane. DOUGS PAL hustled away under encouragement, fanned three wide into the turn, chased MOON AMOUR into the lane then moved up
menacingly but was no match for the winner. TOP DEMON gave chased and raced in the three path in the final turn and flattened out in the stretch.
BONANZA CREEK lacked early speed and passed tiring. ALYS CODE chased in closest pursuit and had nothing left in reserve late.

Footnotes
TANNIN contested the pace from the three path, dueled outside of ROLL THE STONE from the turn, edged away from rival into the stretch and held under
light handling. RED CHOCOLATE sat in striking position inside, was asked to quicken at the quarter pole, angled out to the three path and gained steadily
while getting by late for place. PROVOCATIVE PRINCE gave chase, gained closer order early stretch and was just up for placing. ROLL THE STONE
contended the early pace inside of TANNIN, matched strides through the closing turn and was edged out late. POCKET DIAL lagged and passed tiring.
DARE TO GO stalked the pacesetters through the backstretch, gave chase from the five sixteenth pole and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. ICE
BOX INDY saved ground off the pace, was steadied then eased at the quarter pole and walked off.

LYLA LORRAINE prompted the pace through the backstretch, moved up alongside THRILLOFTHECHASE at the quarter pole to challenge the lead and
won driving. THRILLOFTHECHASE quickly secured a rail position then was rank under restraint into the backstretch, took pressure into the far turn inside of
LYLA LORRAINE and gave way grudgingly inside. WHOOP IT UP checked leaving the opening turn, settled near the back of the pack while in range and
gained late while never threatening. BLUEBELLEJAM raced just off the pace inside and tired early. FIRST SAMARIA outrun throughout.

WHISKEY BOUND dropped well off the early pace, saved ground in second flight, took closer order at the three eights marker, circled into the lane while
steadily progressing into the stretch, closed furiously on the outside and was up just in time. DEUCES ARE WILD sent for early speed then secured a rail
position, led the field through the backstretch while saving ground under a snug hold, was under attacked from the quarter pole then responded to looming
threat, dug in gamely mid stretch under steady urging and was caught in the final strides. INTENT TO STRIKE sat in striking distance while four wide,
fanned four wide moving into a closer position, chased hard into the lane and held for show. REAL GRACE raced in closest pursuit of the leader through the
backstretch, moved up menacingly inside at the head of the stretch and was out finished. BIG AL'S VISION broke alertly then opted to settle well off the
pace and uncoiled bid inside in traffic. EDDYSHAK tracked the pace between foes, came under a drive at the quarter pole, rallied outside into the stretch
and weakened. SHARP DRESSED BEAU steadied into the opening turn, then checked entering the backstretch, tracked inside then lost ground through the
far turn along the rail, responded mildly to urging into the stretch and was out kicked. GEM ALTA failed to threaten. TROOPER JOHN saved ground outside,
chased through the far turn and gave way into the lane. **JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of SHARP DRESSED BEAU against the
rider of DEUCES ARE WILD alleging interference into the first turn was not allowed after review of the Stewards.

TRANG vied two to three wide leaving the chute, pressed into the far turn, gained the lead into the lane and held under steady pressure. LITTLE BRIAN
stalked the early pacesetters, swung five wide in the final turn, gained gradually outside and missed. ALBERTA BOUND pressed the pace while three wide
through the backstretch, was put to a drive from the four path and just held on for show. ALL MIGHTY BO saved ground from well off the pace, gained
closer order from the quarter pole but was unable to improve position through the drive under steady urging. SHIMS SHADOW last away and passed tiring.
PATRICK saved to no avail. SILENT EMISSARY sprinted clear after the break, took pressure through the backstretch from just off the rail and had nothing
left in reserve for the drive. DOMENICO broke awkwardly and trailed throughout.
