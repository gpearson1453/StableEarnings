Footnotes
DRIFTERS CHOICE attended the pace from between rivals entering the turn three wide, took charge at the top of the stretch and powered clear. PALICE
REVENGE tracked in behind the leaders, went two to three wide on the turn, came out in upper stretch and was second best. WILD DANCER prompted the
pace two wide and between rivals into the turn, weakened in the stretch. NAVAJO RUG chased outside going four wide on the turn, came in a bit in
mid-stretch and had no rally. PAPER ROSES was just a bit fractious behind the gate, showed speed for a quarter mile inside then weakened. IT'S MY
BLISS broke awkwardly and slowly, switched out in the early going, was widest of all going five to six deep on the turn and failed to threaten. DUE TO
TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
BENITO CHICO exchanged a very light brush at the break, stalked the pacesetter from outside, went two to three wide on the turn taking over past the
three-sixteenths, drifted out in mid-stretch but drew away under steady handling. ELUSIVE ACCOUNTING switched outside rivals in the early going stalking
while inside a foe but off the rail, went three to four wide on the turn, was no match for the winner but second best. KABULL set the pace from inside,
weakened. WAGON A FIRE exchanged a very light brush at the break, stalked from outside early, entered the turn four wide then dropped back and shifted
in to the two path by the quarter pole, lacked the needed late kick. BATTLEFIELDMARSHAL shifted in and was encouraged along early, saved ground on
the turn but failed to rally. ALIMONY MAN failed to threaten racing at the rear and in the two path on the turn.

Footnotes
HAPPY FORTY EIGHT settled off the leaders outside and five deep, took closer just past the half-mile marker to press, continued five wide on the far turn,
took a narrow lead by the eighth pole, held sway under steady handling. WRAPPED stalked the early pace then moved forward at the half-mile pole to
prompt the issue, continued between runners four wide and made a bid at the head of the lane but couldn't get past inside the winner. TOM T WHO
prompted the early pace three wide and outside, vied between rivals from the half, weakened in the stretch. STREAKS BRO tucked in behind the leaders
racing on or just off the rail on the first turn, moved out a bit up the backstretch dropped back racing three deep, came out four to five wide into upper stretch
and gained belatedly. MR. WILD ROCKETE steadied just slightly after the start, raced just off the rail through the first turn then moved nearer inside, got
through along the rail inside a rival in upper- to mid-stretch but lacked the needed late kick. DANDY DON WHO vied inside but off the rail, gave way. DUE
TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
DRINKIN FIRE WATER set a pressured pace from off the inside early, continued to lead two deep and between runners into the turn, edged clear into upper
stretch then held sway while being kept to task. INDIAN DRAGON stalked just off the leading pair from outside, went three wide on the turn and was asked
for more outside the three-sixteenths, kept on late but was only second best. NO DOUBT raced off the leaders heading up the backstretch, went in the four
path on the turn joined by an outside rival, bumped with that one near the sixteenth pole and ran on. CAUSING CHAOS switched outside a rival heading up
the backstretch near the seven-sixteenths, went five wide on the turn, exchanged a bump with NO DOUBT near the sixteenth pole and had no late kick
thereafter. SACATONE pressed the pace from inside, weakened. NACI STRADAMUS lacked early speed, shifted in and was on or just off the rail through
the turn, passed tired rivals. USING NITRO chased briefly inside, switched out about the seven-sixteenths, went in the two to three path on the turn and
failed to rally. BETWEEN THE BUOYS failed to threaten racing in about the four path on the turn. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

Footnotes
WILMAS IRISH ROVER settled between runners three to four wide off the leaders, began to edge closer leaving the backstretch the second time but was
briefly taken up near the three-eighths pole as a rival began to drop back in front, moved out and thereupon commenced a rally going five then four wide on
the third turn, struck the lead by the top of the stretch and moved clear to set a new track record. SURPRSINGLYPERFECT pressed the pacesetter from
inside but just off the rail and well clear of the others, edged clear coming to the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but clearly second bgest. G M
GAGE was reserved inside, saved ground on all turns and advanced mildly on the fourth turn but could not sustain the effort. HOLY FRAZIER raced at the
rear outside a rival two deep, moved out and advanced four to six wide on the final turn but could not sustain the effort. A CEE DOO CEE settled outside
foes mid-pack going mostly five wide throughout, advanced to within striking distance heading into the third turn but weakened thereafter. CLASSIC GENT
raced mostly in the two to three path off the leaders and inside rivals, advanced to be close up heading up the backstretch the second and final time but
gave way near the three-eighths. REBACK HOME contended outside a rival three wide, came up empty and faded.

MOVIN ON was mildly coaxed from the break, contended for the lead inside rivals, continued to save ground on the far turn, dug in gamely to retake the
lead in mid-stretch and held off a late run from FLYIN FALYNN, who settled outside and off the leaders, went four deep around both turns, put in a steady
bid that was too late. HENNESSY EXPRESS vied two wide and between runners to the three-sixteenths, put a head in front at the furlong marker but was
outfinished. LAST TO BLUSH contended outside, went three wide on the turns, weakened in the stretch. PINK CADILLAC switched out in the early going,
raced mostly in the two to three path throughout and failed to rally. CITYONTHENILE was reserved inside early, moved out heading up the backstretch,
went five wide on the far turn and was empty in the lane.
