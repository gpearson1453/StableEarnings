before a half and widened under urging. BODE'S LIGHT raced three wide between horses with the pace into the turn, fell back before a half then continued
evenly through the lane. LEND IT TEWMEY was forced in leaving the gate, recovered to make the early pace in hand inside rivals while out from the rail,
continued to duel inside the winner into the stretch then weakened. WAYPOINT was slow early, improved position along the rail around the turn, came out
between horses in early stretch and weakened. HENDRICK was shut off leaving the gate, made a run along the rail into the turn, came out into the three
path approaching the lane then flattened out. LET IT B raced four wide with the first flight into the turn and stopped suddenly midway on the bend. DATS

Footnotes
BEAUTILICIOUS was unhurried, began a run in the four path on the turn then quickly drew clear from the outside past midstretch under mild urging. READY
TO MONBA made a three wide run on the turn, gained striking position into the stretch then flattened out. NATTY NORA showed speed from the start, held
a clear lead along the inside into the final furlong then folded. QUITE A MOONGLOW chased two wide into the turn then tired in the lane. CRYPTO CAT
was no factor. BACKHAND lagged to the stretch then passed tired ones. PROPER SHE IS had early position along the rail, steadied behind the leaders
early on the backstretch and again nearing the turn then stopped. WINDY'S SPIRIT was outrun. GIRLYS GIFT stopped and was eased up through the lane.
