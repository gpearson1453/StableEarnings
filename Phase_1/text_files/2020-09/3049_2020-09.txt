Footnotes
ENGLISH CONQUEROR stalked the pace, closed along the rail on the backstretch, bid late turn, battled to the wire and prevailed under steady pressure.
PHANTOM DANCE raced from off the pace, chased three to five-wide on the far turn, rallied outside and gained steadily but just missed. MALIBU EDGE
broke inward and bumped FLAME ZAPPER, stalked the pace, dueled on the far turn, was relentless in the stretch but missed late. WAVE BABY, off slowly,
raced in striking range, bid two-wide late turn then dueled gamely through the stretch. FLAME ZAPPER, bumped at the outset, raced in mid pack, chased
hard three and four-wide on the final turn then finished with a determined drive. AWESOME WOK N ROLL settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on
the far turn then chased through the stretch. SENSATIONALIST led quickly, set a reserved pace, was joined early on the far turn, gave way approaching the
top of the stretch and tired.

far back and finished well. MAS CHIKILIN set a pressured pace, dueled on the turn, was passed by WESTERN TROUBLE upper stretch and chased to the
wire. CALL ME WALLY forced the issue, dueled on the turn, was passed a furlong out and raced gamely to the end. GASCONADE settled in mid pack, was
hustled along the rail late turn then closed through the stretch. DISTINCT PASSION, in range, chased two and three-wide on the turn then finished gamely
to no avail. BLUE BELT, in range, chased three and four-wide on the turn and was game in the stretch. ELUSIVE RO settled in mid pack, was hustled two

Footnotes
BODACIOUS MISS pushed up the inside to lead inside a rival while under a hold, drifted off the rail late on the turn but sprinted clear once the field turned
for home, never seriously challenged down to the wire. JOKERS RUN was bumped and crowded at the start, advanced three to five wide into range on the
turn, closed doggedly down the stretch to grab the place spot late while still outside. BIG GINGER hit the gate at the start before moving up to duel on the
lead with the winner, was carried out a tad by that rival late on the turn, stayed on gamely down the lane losing the place spot late. DONTPUSHYOURLUCK
was three wide stalking the leaders into the turn, carried out to the four path when the pacesetters came out a bit, dipped back to the two path down the
stretch when outkicked by the top trio. GOTE GO broke out at the start, settled in mid pack in the two path throughout and tried to bid in upper stretch but
evened out in the final sixteenth. LADY PETROL (GB) settled off the pace, came two to three wide into the stretch and found her best stride late to pass
runners in the final sixteenth. SHE TAKES FLIGHT was bumped by a rival to her inside at the start, came from well off the pace and angled out in upper
stretch, lengthening her stride noticeably in the final furlong. RULE THE SEA chased the leaders along the inside, was in behind the front pack turning for
home but levelled off in the final furlong. VICTORIAVILLE sat along the rail in mid pack, was roused at the top of the lane but had response late. FORTY
SMOOTH was steadied, then pinballed at the break dropping far back before trying to rally while three to four wide on the turn but could not sustain her bid.
OVERSTATE hesitated soon after the break, trailing the field throughout.

lead midway through the backstretch, set a pressured pace, was headed at the top of the stretch and chased mildly but held place. KENTUCKY FAN raced
in mid pack, closed two to four-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive. DALLIAN M. broke inward ands settled off the pace, came four to
six-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and gained steadily to the end. SAVED AT THE WIRE stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide
through the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out late. MARTINA'S GALS stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn then finished
gamely. SLASHS RED DIAMOND, steadied at the start and settled off the pace, closed to mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn then
evened out between rivals. FIONA BAY broke outward and raced from off the pace, closed early turn, ran into traffic a furlong out and finished evenly.
WHO'S WHO INTHEZOO stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. VOIR DIRE raced from off the early
pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. NAUGHTY MABEL settled in mid pack, chased two to four-wide on the turn
then evened out in the final furlong.

COUNT AGAIN was hard held in mid pack while three to two wide on the first turn, steadied heavily into the far turn back to the rear, circled the field three
wide to loom up turning for home, drove to the front outside the eighth pole, shifting in at the point but straightening out quickly to get a clear lead, holding
safe to the wire. SIR SAHIB settled in mid pack along the rail, angled out in upper stretch to commence a rally, lost his path outside the eighth pole, angling
out again to close fast late for the place. SAY THE WORD broke in at the start, stayed inside at the rear of the field until angling out into the three path late
on the far turn, tipped out into the five or six path down the lane and closed resolutely for the show spot. NAKAMURA was three wide and near the rear
through the first turn, stayed in the three path down the backside and bid on the far turn, still in contention in upper stretch before shying away from a rival
nearing the eighth pole, his rally stalling in the later stages, holding on to a minor award. WOODBRIDGE settled off the pace and two to three wide before
rallying into contention on the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch but was outkicked down the lane. STANDARD DEVIATION chased along the inside, was
behind the leader into the stretch and squeezed up the fence when that one tired, but could only run evenly down to the wire, not a threat. TIZ A SLAM led
quickly and set a soft pace early, repelled a couple of challengers on the far turn and had a clear lead in upper stretch but tired nearing the eighth pole and
lost positions from there. SKYWIRE stalked the leader throughout before tiring midway on the far turn and retreating from that point. JUNGLE FIGHTER was
four to three wide mid pack on the first turn, moved up to stalk the leader while widest down the backstretch, still battling until the field turned for home but
backed up down the stretch. THERE WAS A STEWARD'S INQUIRY REGARDING THE WINNER WITH REGARDS TO AN INCIDENT NEARING THE
EIGHTH POLE. AFTER REVIEW, THE ORIGINAL RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

SILVER DAHLIA forced the pace two-wide, dug in upper stretch and had command near the final 16th, driving. TRADING BAY settled in mid pack in hand,
was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, chased four-wide into the stretch, rallied outside and was up in time to garner the place position. TAKOTA held
a short early lead, set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch but failed to sustain her drive and was passed a 16th out. STERLING SPEED
was rated off the pace, closed three to five-wide through the turn and finished under a determined drive. LET'S HAVE FUN stalked the pace, was hustled
two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the late stages. EIGHT SPEED forced the pace in hand, stalked from the rail on
the turn but flattened out in the stretch. MRS. DEL settled in mid pack, dropped back along the rail through the turn and lacked a rally.

STARSHIP JUBILEE broke a bit outward and settled in mid pack, was steadied behind rivals on the backstretch and on the turn as she wanted to go but
was being kept under cover, chased into the stretch, rallied, had command in the final furlong and finished under a hand ride. MARCH TO THE ARCH was
away slowly and raced from off the pace, closed two-wide on the turn, faced traffic upper stretch then rallied gamely and was coming late. WAR OF WILL
broke alertly but was rated in mid pack, closed three-wide late turn, launched his bid upper stretch, drew even approaching the furlong marker but was
passed in the final furlong and chased to the wire. OLYMPIC RUNNER, away slowly and off the early pace, closed three-wide on the turn, tipped out at the
top of the stretch then posted a steady gain. ARMISTICE DAY, off slowly, raced in mid pack, saved ground on the turn, chased into the stretch, encountered
traffic then finished evenly between rivals. ADMIRALTY PIER gained the early lead and set the pace under strong restraint, moved clear into the turn, was
set down upper stretch but was engaged by WAR OF WILL but was quickly passed by STARSHIP JUBILEE and gave way. SHIRL'S SPEIGHT, off slowly,
stalked the pace along the rail, was still in range upper stretch but evened out in the final 16th. VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) pressed the pace, came after
the leader late turn, lost her path upper stretch and evened out.

Footnotes
DIRTY DANGLE sat a nice trip nestled in along the rail behind the leaders, angled off the inside to the four path outside the eighth pole and flew by them all
late, widening her margin as the wire approached. ILLEGAL SMILE (IRE) broke in and bumped a rival at the start, was last and hard held while four wide
into the turn, circled the group to make it four in a line turning into the stretch, wore down the third horse to lead in the stretch inside the sixteenth pole but
was no match for the perfect trip winner late. ROCKET RELOAD was bumped at the break, stalked three wide under a hold into the turn, advanced on the
two leaders to bid turning for home, led at the sixteenth pole but couldn't match the energy of the top pair, battling on gamely. SOUPER MUNNINGS stalked
the leader early, pressing that one around the turn and bid for the front turning for home, had a brief lead in upper stretch but couldn't seal the deal, faltering
in the final sixteenth. FOREST DRIFT started awkwardly and settled in mid pack, tapped on the brakes and steadied when between runners into the turn
dropping back, mildly closing down the lane to pass a couple of tired foes. CHATELET won a scramble for the early lead but was stalked and pressed by a
rival down the backside and through the turn, her advantage under siege turning for home, dropping back when headed in upper stretch to the wire. SILENT
MAMBA along the rail in mid pack, was under restraint and fell back to trail on the turn, never entering contention.

Footnotes
CHECKERBOARD FLOOR got away alertly, set a pressured pace, dueled on the turn, drove clear upper stretch and held under steady pressure. LAST
AMERICAN EXIT, off slowly and well back early, closed angling from two to four-wide through the turn then rallied gamely outside. EXECUTIVE SEARCH
stalked the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. KID FORESTER settled in mid pack,
came two and three-wide through the turn, ran into traffic mid stretch then closed late when clear. BEND IN THE RIVER broke outward and bumped YOLA,
stalked the pace, raced two and three-wide on the turn and was all out in the stretch. LAKESIDE PARK, in range, came four-wide through the turn, chased
into the stretch but evened out late. GOLDMINE CAT raced in mid pack, closed four and five-wide on the turn then rallied from the outside but evened out in
deep stretch. SPEEDY MOONLITE forced the pace, bid into the turn, dueled or forced the issue, gave way upper stretch and faded. WHITE WEDDING
settled off the pace, came along the rail and two-wide through the turn moving off the fence only to get by the fading JERSEY DIAMOND then finished
evenly. YOLA stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn but flattened out in the final 16th. JERSEY DIAMOND stalked early, dropped back along
the rail early turn and lacked a rally.
