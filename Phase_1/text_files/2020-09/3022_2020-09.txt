Footnotes
HE LIKES CURVES settled off the pace along the inside on the backstretch, stayed along the rail into the turn in behind horses, got thru the rail approaching
the stretch and responded strong to urging to get pull away. MALIBU MAGIC stalked lone leader along the inside on the backstretch, stayed along the rail
into the turn, and into the stretch in the two path, finished well under steady urging. BADGER broke sharp and cleared field quickly early, stayed along the
inside through the turn and into the stretch in the three path, responded to urging while weakening late in the lane. CHIEFTAIN'S LAD hopped and broke out
at the start and bumped outside rival, stalked in between rivals on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and into the stretch in the three path, lacked rally
when asked by rider in lane. SOUND CHECKERS stalked lone leader three wide on the backstretch, stayed three wide through the turn and in the five path
in the stretch, lacked needed response in the lane when asked. LOST THE MINISTER bumped by inside rival at the start, lost path and had to settle at the
back of the pack on the backside, stayed off the rail in the four path on the backstretch and three wide on the turn, entered stretch in the five path while
lacking bid in the lane.
