the finish. LUCKY STRIDE raced off the pace, had an inside trip, angled out at the eighth pole and rallied late outside for third. STORY TIME pressed the
pace racing outside of VALEDICTORIAN, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. VALEDICTORIAN set the

Footnotes
ANDREZ CONQUIST tracked close up on the inside, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled with THE MORMON MAULER into the stretch, dug in
gamely outside of that rival and drew clear past the furlong marker. THE MORMON MAULER vied inside for the early lead, took over on the backside,
dueled with the winner on the far turn, dug in gamely inside in upper stretch, then yielded and dug in to save the place spot. SYMBOL AZTECA raced off the
pace, moved up four wide on the far turn and rallied late near the inside. FEISTY KITTEN raced three wide on the first turn, settled three wide off the pace
and closed mildly for a share. SWIFT KID steadied at the start, raced three wide early, four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, made a four or five
wide run nearing the far turn, then finished evenly in the lane. STORM ALFEET was outrun early, went three wide at the quarter pole and passed tired ones.
MASTERIO raced off the pace between rivals and failed to threaten. SUPER SHOES was off slowly and steadied after, then did not factor. DOHKO pulled
and was steadied early, raced off the pace inside and faded. ENGLISH TIDE raced three wide off the pace and faded. PHIL THE BANKER vied outside for
the lead, then chased on the backside, checked in tight nearing the far turn and dropped back.
