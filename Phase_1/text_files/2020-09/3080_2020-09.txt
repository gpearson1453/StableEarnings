Footnotes
B DUBYA allowed to settle, closed willingly in the six path through the stretch and got up in the final strides. SUPER BEAU sprinted to a daylight lead soon
after the start, set the pace to the top of the stretch, dug in determinedly and just failed. FATHER DENNIS never far back, swung wide and closed a gap late
in the six path. MINE N YOURS chased the pace into the far turn, rallied two wide to gain a narrow lead after six furlongs then came up. DARINGLY BOLD
failed to menace. TACTICAL QUALITY was no factor. COTTONWOOD CANYON was in tight a few strides out of the gate. BRUHLMEYER was through
after a half. ALEX THE DUDE had brief speed.

CHIEF RANDEL broke alertly, contested the lead along the inside into the stretch then finished full of run to win going away under a hand ride. GOING
WITH STYLE stalked the pace into the far turn, loomed boldly three wide approaching the quarter pole then was no match for the winner. LEOMBRUNO
matched strides for the lead two wide for six furlongs then faded. GOLDEN POINT was outrun. SKYTOWN CAT was through early. BUCKET BEAT pulled
up on the backstretch and was walked off.

ANNIVERSARY ROSE bore out at the start bumping FLAT OUT SUPER, chased the pace two wide into the turn, dropped back, shifted out four wide, came
on again through the final furlong and was along in time. NATIVE WAHOO chased the pace into the turn, rallied two wide to make the lead near the furlong
marker then finished second best. FLAT OUT SUPER stumbled out of the gate bumping into BLACK BUTTE, was then bumped by the winner causing her
rider to lost his left iron, he got back in leaving the chute, rushed to contention, loomed boldly while splitting rivals at the top of the stretch and finished with
good courage. PRADO'S TRUST passed tiring rivals. BLACK BUTTE was bumped at the start, settled within striking distance then lacked the needed
response. SKY VISION away alertly, set the pace to the top of the stretch then stopped to a walk.
