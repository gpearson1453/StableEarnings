Footnotes
HERO'S HOPE settled off the early pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, reached even terms near the quarter pole, dueled outside of
DAY from there to the wire and prevailed. DAY was fractious in the gate, advanced three wide to the lead around first turn, cleared off midway around that
bend, set the pace in the two path, dug in inside of the winner from the quarter pole, dueled through the lane and was narrowly outfinished. STOLEN LOVE
stalked the pace from the rail, angled out near the eighth pole and lacked a rally. AWESOME AT RIEDES raced off the pace three wide and had a mild
belated rally. IWISHIWASPECIAL saved ground in midpack, angled four wide in upper stretch and finished evenly between foes. SEBRAY tracked the pace
two wide and came up empty in the lane. MONKEY'S MEDAL played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
PRESS MY BETS hesitated at the start, raced well back two wide, swung six wide in upper stretch, surged outside under left-handed urging, was up near
the sixteenth pole and quickly drew off. ANNAMATED MOON settled off the pace three wide, shifted further out in upper stretch, rallied inside of the winner,
was no match for that foe late but finished well to gain the place. NOTHING BETTER dueled inside in the two path, dispatched his pace foes in midstretch,
led to the sixteenth pole but could not resist the closers late. HAUNTEDBYTHEMUSIC chased the pace two wide between foes and could only rally mildly
inside of rivals in the lane. REDEEM EDDIE bobbled at the break, recovered to disputed the pace three wide, led between foes nearing the lane then
weakened in the drive. STEADYTILLREADY tracked the early pace outside, bid four wide nearing the lane and faded in the stretch. MY DANNY BOY had
early speed inside, hit the rail near the three-eighths pole, causing the rider to lose the left iron, dropped back inside and was eased with the rider sitting
down through the lane.

Footnotes
SETHAMEE STREET was bumped just after the start, raced off the pace inside, made progress inside around the turn, tipped out nearing the lane, closed
three wide, seized command near the sixteenth pole and powered clear under moderate urging. BLUES MARY stalked the pace two wide, bid between foes
in midstretch, was no match for the winner but stayed on willingly to be a clear second. GLITTERING JUDY was bumped just after the start, advanced two
wide down the backstretch, cleared nearing the turn, angled in to set the pace inside, led to midstretch and lasted for the show. SPIN CONTROL broke
about two lengths behind the field, raced well back early, advanced inside around the turn, bid inside of foes in midstretch then flattened out through the final
furlong. SAVVY ALLY failed to menace while racing three wide. LADY BOSS led early, chased inside around the turn and weakened. AWSUM ROAR
played no factor while racing four wide. WILDCATTIN was outrun while racing four wide. CLEVER SARAH chased the pace three wide and faded through
the stretch. LARIMAR was outrun while racing two wide.

GREY MANNERS pressed the pace in the three path, seized command near the three-eighths pole, drew clear in upper stretch and held clear under
left-handed urging. REVOLVING LOVE settled off the pace along the inside, tipped out in upper stretch and closed between rivals. SMARTY CAT stalked
the pace four wide and lacked a rally. DOGWOOD QUEEN lacked early speed, raced two wide around the turn, rallied at the rail in the lane and was in
close quarters near the sixteenth pole. THAT IS KEY raced well back three and four wide and rallied belatedly. MOON OVER VICTORIA set the pace in the
two path and tired in the drive. VOILA BABY never threatened while racing three wide. AFANDI failed to menace while racing four wide. IVORY NOT
WHITE was outrun while racing four and five wide. PLAY THE MAX had some speed inside and steadily faded.

Footnotes
SPINSTER ROAD lacked early speed while saving ground, split rivals two wide nearing the lane, closed inside, surged clear nearing the eighth pole and
widened under a drive. DAVID'S PROSPEC tracked the pace two and three wide, bid in midstretch but was no match for the winner. VALLEY CAL was
devoid of speed, raced four and five wide and was along for the show. GONE PARADISE was bumped after the start, sprinted clear to set the pace in the
two path, held clear to upper stretch and tired. MARTINI LANE was slammed between foes at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. FUEGO was
bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide and came up empty. MAXIMO STRONG veered in at the start and slammed into foes, veered out soon
after, raced three wide and made little further impact. BOLTER was bumped at the start, saved ground and played no factor. CONFUSION was bumped at
the start, chased the pace three wide and was through after a half. CURRY'S MOUNTAIN was slammed between foes at the start, raced two and three wide
and was never close. SELECTMAN was bumped at the start, chased the pace inside and stopped in the stretch.
