Footnotes
UNO TROUBLE MAKER stalked outside the leader the applied pressure into the turn, headed rival at the five-sixteenths, kicked clear past the quarter pole
and drew away under some left-handed urging and hand urging late. ETERNAL ENDEAVOUR (GB) in range of the lead off the inside, went four wide
around the bend, lacked room behind a pair of rivals in upper stretch, angled out and finished willingly through the final furlong and nailed MADAME
BARBARIAN for the place. MADAME BARBARIAN chased four wide through the turn, could not summon the needed response in the lane got edged on the
line for second. SWEET RAFAELA up close early inside the leader, moved out three wide on the turn and never produced a bid. RED LIVY (IRE) set the
pace in the two path, pressured into the bend, headed by rival at the five-sixteenths pole, could not go on with that rival and gave way in the lane. CROWN
KITTEN went five wide around the turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
KITTYHAWK LASS settled outside a rival, went three deep on the backstretch, closed in around the far turn, bid four wide into the stretch, took over at the
eighth pole and held off the runner-up to the wire. CLEARLY GONE unhurried in the early stages and traveled outside a rival, moved three wide on the
backstretch, three deep into the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied alongside the winner but could not find the needed late punch. LEXINGTON
GRACE (IRE) unhurried in the beginning, moved to the inside then a bit off the rail on the backstretch, entered the stretch three wide and finished well.
MESO tracked near the inside, saved ground into the lane, slipped through along the fence and bid in upper stretch but flattened in the late stages.
SUGARY settled inside, saved ground to the stretch, lacked room in the lane, angled in late and finished evenly. TAMMY'S WINDOW threw head and was
off slow to begin, trailed the field throughout, came out into the stretch and was never a factor. LISTEN TO BLUE chased a bit off the rail then between
runners on the far turn, steadied off heels of rival nearing the sixteenth pole and could not regain momentum. SEASIDE DANCER stalked a bit off the rail,
bid outside at the quarter pole, led into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. MONGOLIAN WINDOW took control early, set the pace from inside
and gave way in the late stretch. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
BIDDY DUKE vied for the lead four deep into and around the turn, drifted out a bit into the stretch, drew clear under right-handed urging approaching the
eighth pole and inched away under a hand ride late. LUCKY PERIDOT brushed from the inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace near the fence, angled
four wide around the turn, showed late effort and got up for second. ROAD RAGER broke out a bit then quickly corrected, showed speed inside and vied for
the lead with a trio of rivals, fought to the furlong marker but could not go on with the winner late and lost the place. QUALITY RESPONSE vied three deep
to the stretch and flattened in the late stages. WATCH ME BURN stumbled a bit and brushed outside rival at the start, well placed behind the speedy
quartet, entered the turn in the two path then moved out to exit the bend five wide and proved no menace. BULLETPROOF ONE vied between foes early
while holding a short advantage, continued to battle two wide and between foes into the lane but weakened in the final furlong.

OFTHE TEMPLE settled early, raced two wide then angled out in upper stretch, closed fast and proved second best. FLORAL ESSENCE stalked off the rail,
vied between shortly then chased the leader off the rail on the backstretch, bid between on the second turn, led into the stretch, fought back in the drive and
lost the place. MISS EVER READY saved ground into the lane, angled out in the stretch, showed a mild response but lacked room late. MISS PEAKY
BLINDER traveled along the inside then moved off the rail, angled five wide around the turn, bid upper stretch and took a short lead at the eighth pole but
flattened in the late stages. CIELO D'ORO chased inside, vied for command then took over at the nine-sixteenths pole, showed the way to the far turn then
vied with a pair of rivals around that bend and weakened in the stretch. MAMMA RAMA stalked the pace near the fence, moved out into the three path and
failed to respond. HATSHEPSUT fractious in the gate, stalked outside a rival then off the rail, came three wide into the stretch, drifted inward in the lane and
had nothing left. VALENTINE GHOST sped to the front then lugged out on the first turn, vied three deep then chased outside a rival, re-bid outside and vied
three deep around the far turn, chased in the upper stretch before getting forced out and faded. TIZ PURE GRACE traveled near the back of the pack,
trailed into the far turn and was never a factor.

LEPRINO stumbled slightly at the start, took aim three wide into the stretch, gained the lead at the eighth pole and edged away. PRINCE RICKY set the
pace and angled to the inside, inched away into the turn, led clear into the drive, got headed with a furlong to go, could not match the winner late but proved
second best. TIME TO TESTIFY traveled near the back of the pace outside a rival, advanced four wide around the turn, drifted in a bit in the stretch and
closed willingly for the show. BABAEL stalked off the rail, angled four wide leaving the turn and kept on for a minor award. ROSSMAN chased near the
inside, moved out into the two path on the turn and weakened. TIGER'S SONG chased the speed outside a rival then moved up outside the leader three
deep, chased the pace into the turn, went three wide around the bend and had nothing left for the stretch. KENJILOOKSLUCKY settled early along the
inside, angled out into the three path on the turn and failed to rally. FLOYD MONEYMAKER chased the leader early then moved up to press outside, lost
contact and chased in the two path, dropped back around the bend and faded out of contention. DRINK TO THAT shuffled back early, raced off the rail then
moved out four wide leaving the turn and proved no menace. SHARP SPEAKER pulled up early and walked off under his own power.

the gate but recovered quickly to challenge for command, dueled for the lead from the inside, cleared MISS FRAULEIN in the lane but could not hold off the
winner. DOLCE tracked three wide into the stretch, rallied late and earned the show. MISS FRAULEIN dueled outside a rival for the lead into and around the
turn, fought back in the stretch but weakened late. VELVET QUEEN bumped at the start, stalked off the rail, steadied three times early to the turn, came
four wide into the stretch and improved position. SWIRLING saved ground along the inside then moved a bit off the rail in the stretch and passed tired rivals.
JEWEL THIEF settled off the pace then angled to the inside, tipped out in upper stretch and failed to rally. TIJORI stalked the top pair from the fence,
remained inside to the stretch and weakened. WOKE UP TO ACES chased between foes then outside a rival and weakened in the lane. DEVILS DANCE

Footnotes
SUPERMAN SHAQ sped clear and angled in, dueled with PARNELLLI then vied inside to the stretch, shook free at the three-sixteenths pole and drew off.
PARNELLI chased the leader then challenged from the outside dueled outside around the turn and vied between leaving the bend, failed to match the
winner in the lane but stayed on to prove second best. HOT PASTRAMI raced a bit off the rail then angled three wide into the stretch, showed a mild rally
and edged RISK AND REWARD for the show honors. RISK AND REWARD attended the pace three deep, challenged outside the top pair around the turn,
flattened in the final furlong and lost the show. RED FLAG off a bit slow and shifted in at the start, came out on the backstretch, angled in on the turn and
never threatened. TENOR went four wide into the stretch, raced greenly near the furlong marker and weakened. LABOR UNION broke in and hit the gate at
the start, raced five wide into the turn then angled into the three path and proved no menace. RUNAWAY WYWY stumbled leaving the gate, dropped back
on the backstretch and was ridden out through the turn and across the wire.

Footnotes
PIXELATE bumped twice leaving the gate, tracked from the inside then angled out on the far turn, closed in the lane and surged late to get up in time.
MARGOT'S BOY stalked a bit off the rail, took aim two wide into the stretch, bid outside and forged to the front at the sixteenth pole then nailed by the
winner. DOMINANT SOUL showed the way early, set the pace up the backstretch, saved ground while clear into the stretch and yielded late. CALIFORNIA
KOOK placed off the pace and a bit off the rail, went between foes into the far turn, lacked room and steadied at the five-sixteenths pole, asked to go
through rivals again into the stretch and finished willingly for a minor award. KISS TODAY GOODBYE unhurried and settled outside a rival, angled four wide
around the second turn and summoned a mild late bid. KANDEREL settled off the pace, raced in a bit tight into the stretch, lost the whip and brushed with
rival in upper stretch and gained ground late. AMERICAN FARMER tucked inside and saved ground to the stretch and went evenly late. K P ALL SYSTEMS
GO unhurried from the start and angled to the inside, saved ground into the stretch, brushed with rival and failed to threaten. GUITTY (FR) off slow at the
start, traveled near the back of the pack, went between foes into the far turn, lacked room and checked past the five-sixteenths pole, came out into the lane
then altered out further behind a pair of rivals and could not rally. HEYWOODS BEACH off the rail throughout, came four wide into the stretch and made no
impact. NO SLO MO bumped twice at the start, chased off the rail, three wide into the stretch and weakened. HAND TIMED.

rival on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and held the place. BIG STORY chased four wide around the turn, drifted inward in the stretch and was
denied the place. ALPINE THUNDER chased off the rail, split foes on the turn, exited the bend three wide, angled out and finished evenly. ALEXANDER'S
DREAM bumped both sides at the start then shifted out and bumped rival soon after, chased between foes then angled in on the turn, lacked room in the

midway around the turn and tired in the lane. CHARGE CASH bumped both sides at the start, went four wide into the lane and never responded to urging. J
