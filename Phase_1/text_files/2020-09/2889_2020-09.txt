SHE'S CRAFTY never far back, surged in the four path into the stretch, made the lead near the furlong marker then widened the balance of the trip to win
as much the best while in hand. BISCAYNE BAY dueled for the lead two wide into the turn, made the lead, edged clear into the stretch, was headed, drifted
out late and was no match for the winner. ENDURING LOVE trailed into the stretch then had a mild late rally three wide. CATABOUT failed to menace.
GERTIE CAT well placed, failed to respond. MYTICKETTOPARADISE dueled with the runner up along the inside into the turn, had speed into the stretch
then gave way. KIST close up three wide, weakened in deep stretch.
