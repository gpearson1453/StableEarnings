UNLIMITED TALENT broke inward and bumped SILENT FIRE, pressed the pace three-wide, chased on the turn then rallied outside and was up in the late
stages. GALVASTON forced the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn, bid in the final furlong and gained the lead but was passed in deep stretch.
COLTONS DREAM led quickly, set a pressured pace from the rail, shook clear at the top of the stretch but was headed in the final furlong and chased to the
end. JR BOURBON broke outward and settled well off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide through the turn but never reached contention. SILENT
FIRE, bumped at the start, raced from well off the pace, was hustled on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
SICK SOCIETY broke outward and settled off the pace, closed along the rail through the backstretch and far turn, waited for a hole to open and SUNSET
PHOENIX came out a bit while dueling upper stretch, split foes and sprinted clear finishing under a hand ride. RING IN SILENCE stumbled leaving the gate
and settled off the pace, closed angled from the rail to three-wide late turn, rallied gamely and got up for place. KATZ YOU LATER broke inward, closed on
the first turn, forced the pace on the backstretch, bid two-wide mid turn, was headed, rebid upper stretch but was outkicked. SUNSET PHOENIX stalked the
pace, closed on the backstretch, took a short lead three-wide mid turn, dueled into the stretch but was passed by the winner in the final furlong and gave
way. SEA OF DIAMONDS showed brief speed then stalked the pace, dropped back under a ride on the far turn, was game but failed to menace. EXQUISE
led on the first turn, set a pressured pace, was headed midway through the far turn, stayed bravely to the top of the stretch and gave way. GABBY'S
BALLERINA settled off the pace, was hustled angling in from the three-wide to the rail on the far turn then finished evenly.

Footnotes
MONEY MATTERS forced the pace, dueled two and three-wide on the turn, battled through the stretch and edged ahead late. NEWS FLASH led early,
dueled from the rail on the turn but gave way grudgingly in deep stretch. MUSKOKA SON, in range, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, chased into
the stretch, launched a determined drive but hung late. MISTER OAKLEY, away slowly, settled off the pace, closed fast angling two to four-wide on the turn
then rallied gamely and was gaining late. POLYDEUCES was pinched back at the start, settled off the pace, closed three-wide late turn and was all out
through the stretch. COHIBA GHOST settled off the pace, angled from the rail to two-wide on the turn, was steadied approaching the top of the stretch,
posted a mild close but did not menace. HARD N'SWEET was bumped leaving the gate, settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but
evened out in the late stages. RINGDANA broke inward and bumped HARD N' SWEET, settled off the pace, came four and five-wide on the turn but never
reached contention. ITMAKESMEWONDER raced in striking range early but dropped back along the rail through the turn and lacked a rally. BET ALPHA
pressed the pace, chased three to five-wide on the turn then tired at the top of the stretch. PER RULING 1094086 FROM THE ONTARIO RACING
COMMISSION, MONEY MATTERS HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
LADY KRATOS opened a quick lead by winning the break, allowed a rival to stalk and lead on the turn with the rider sitting chilly, regained the front turning
for home and shook off all challengers by midstretch, holding safe down to the wire. BARKIN trailed the field into the turn, angled out rail to three wide at the
turn for home, tipped out widest before the eighth pole and was gobbling up the ground late while outside. LA ISADORA sat in mid pack and two wide
around the turn, fell back in upper stretch but came again on her wrong lead between rivals in the final furlong, switching to her right lead late and surging
for the show spot. SPIDER BELLE was off the pace and along the inside, came up the fence into range by the eighth pole but failed to sustain her bid and
lost the show spot late. CARA CATERINA chased along the inside, came off the fence to take a shot at the leaders as they turned for home but couldn't seal
the deal, dropping back in the final eighth. CON THIEN settled in mid pack along the inside before tapping on the brakes into the turn, then got into a tight
spot with rivals on both sides at the sixteenth pole, running evenly in the later stages. CANDY'S DREAM stalked the leader early, took a short lead midway
on the turn but her pace buddy was playing possum, regaining the front as they turned for home and pulling away by the three sixteenths, this rival dropping
positions quickly in the final seventy yards. LETTER ROLL broke slow and dropped back, circled two to four wide on the turn and came out into the six path
in upper stretch, lugging in on his wrong lead down the stretch. LOTS TO LIKE chased outside the two leaders throughout, still in range as they turned for
home but retreated down the lane. DAMA ELEGANTE jumped up at the start and trailed by a large margin throughout, walking off after her non effort.

early, settled in mid pack, chased two-wide late turn and finished under a determined drive. FOXXY BELLE moved up to press the pace mid backstretch,
was hustled along the rail and two-wide ob the turn but evened out in the late stages. CHARMAINE'S MIA settled in mid pack, was pinched back along the
rail at the turn, was hustled along the fence but had no closing response. WINANDYOURIN GIN pressed the pace from mid backstretch, chased two and
three-wide on the turn but was empty in the stretch. BOOGIE WITH ME, away slowly, raced from off the pace, was hustled along the rail then two-wide on

Footnotes
SILENT GUROO led quickly, set a reserved pace and held sway under a hand ride. IL MALOCCHIO stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide late turn and
chased through the stretch. SILENT BUT VIOLENT stalked the pace, rode the rail on the turn, was hemmed in on the fence through the stretch and could
not get to a clear path. ERASMO'S GIRL raced in mid pack, came four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, finished all out but did not menace.
DIVINE GENESIS stalked the pace early, settled in mid pack, came three-wide through the turn but evened out in the final furlong. WHO'S WHO
INTHEZOO settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. TARA EMPIRE raced in mid pack, came two and
three-wide through the turn but lacked a closing response. DYNAMIC CONTRAST broke outward and settled well back, raced four then three-wide on the
turn and passed a tiring rival in the late stages. SECRETLY, in mid pack early, was hustled along the rail through the turn then tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
TRADING BAY showed early speed, was joined in a duel on the backstretch, was headed by a second rival at the turn, bid three-wide mid turn, led
four-wide at the top of the stretch, held under steady pressure then drove clear late. OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY, bumped with horses from both sides at the
start, moved up the rail to lead into the turn, was engaged mid turn, dueled, was headed at the top of the stretch and chased to the end. TIZLEGAL settled
off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then finished gamely in vain. LA BESTIA stalked the pace, chased three and four-wide on the turn
and was all out through the stretch. ELUSIVE GEM hit the gate leaving, settled in striking range, was hustled from the rail on the turn but evened out in the
final 16th. SIMPLE SOUVENIR was rated off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. SWEET EDITION bumped
with OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY at the start, settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn then chased through the stretch.
DRUMGREENAGHBRIDGE bumped with OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY leaving the gate, had speed, was headed at the turn, stalked two-wide on the turn then
