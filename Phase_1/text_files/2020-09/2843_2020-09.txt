Footnotes
MOONOVERTHEBAYOU bumped repeatedly and altered in early, raced off the pace near the inside, angled three wide around the far turn, closed through
the lane, reeled in the leader and drove past late. BAM BAM AGAIN stalked a bit off the rail, closed in from the outside and headed the leader at the quarter
pole, kicked clear into the stretch, led through the lane but could not fend off the winner. SPEAKEROFTHEHOUSE trailed the field off the inside then
outside a rival, exited the far turn four to five wide, steered out further in the stretch and rallied late for the show. NEXT REVOLT went three wide into the
first turn the moved up between runners, stalked off the inside to the stretch and finished evenly. ALL I CAN SAY stalked three deep then outside a rival,
exited the far turn four wide and lacked a bid. MY JOURNEY settled a bit off the inside, angled in on the far turn and never threatened. SEE THROUGH IT
had good early speed and cleared the field then angled in around the first turn, showed the way to the far turn, challenged at the quarter pole and could not
offer resistance to that foe and folded in the lane. BODEGA bumped both sides early, tracked off the rail then two wide into the stretch and came up empty.
SURPRISE FASHION bumped early, raced near the back of the pack, went four wide into the lane and never threatened. GEORGIAN ROAD raced four
wide into the first turn then outside a rival, went between foes into the backstretch, dropped back a bit at the half-mile point then further back into the far turn
and around that bend and tired.

Footnotes
AWHITESPORTSCOAT traveled mid-pack off the inside, angled in on the turn, saved ground into the lane, tipped out in the stretch, surged late and nailed
BURN ME TWICE on the line. BURN ME TWICE dueled for the lead early then dropped back to stalk the leader to the turn, raced a bit off the rail into the
drive, rallied along the inside and took over late but got nailed on the line. AROUND THE DIAL stalked off the rail then went outside a rival on the turn,
ranged up outside the leader then got floated out by that rival leaving the bend, grabbed command and kicked clear but was caught in the late stages. KING
PARKER unhurried in the beginning, traveled two wide then angled out leaving the turn and finished strongly. BLACK STORM chased outside a pair of
rivals, four wide into the lane and showed a mild response. LUCKY ROMANO dueled from the inside then moved clear to the pace, challenged around the
turn and met that bid while drifting out leaving the turn, drifted back inward in the stretch and flattened in the final furlong. MORE HONOR chased the pace
between foes, three wide into the lane and never produced a bid. WRITE ME A SONG angled to the rail and saved ground around the bend and never
rallied. MARKET SENTIMENT went four wide into the stretch and weakened. D K'S CROWN trailed the field into the turn, stayed along the inside to the
stretch and was never a factor. FERGUSON traveled four wide into the lane and came up empty. RICK'S DREAM chased off the rail, two wide into the lane,
injured at the eighth pole and was vanned off.

late over the runner-up. ON MARS tucked inside early, saved ground around the far turn, lacked room and checked entering the stretch, gained a clear path
and rallied along the fence but was too late. DONUT GIRL trailed the field early a bit off the rail then went outside a rival, went four wide into the stretch,
closed and gained the show. KLEEN KARMA traveled near the back of the field, angled five wide and got bumped into the stretch, showed a mild rally and
whittle the gap late. HOT ON THE TRAIL stalked the leader near the the inside, moved into the two path around the far turn, took aim three wide in the
stretch and went evenly in the final sixteenth. EMPRESS OF FIRE settled off the pace and outside a rival, raced four wide then drifted out and bumped rival
at the three-sixteenths pole and finished willingly in the final furlong. LOSTINTRANZLATION traveled off the rail then three deep, exited the far turn three
wide and weakened. PUSHING SIXTY chased from between rivals then two wide into the lane and never rallied. ROSE DUNN showed speed from the
inside, set the pace up the backstretch, pressured into the far turn, met the bid from outside around the bend and fought back into the stretch then gave
way. DROP THE MIC angled to the inside early, moved off the rail then came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SPANISH CHANNEL went
three wide into the stretch and faded. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
EDDIE'S NEW DREAM stalked the pacesetter a bit off the rail, bid outside and took a short lead at the quarter pole, cleared foe in upper stretch and drew
off to the wire. WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE chased off the rail, two to three wide into the lane, finished well and gained second. ENSLEYS DREAM sped to
the front and controlled the pace, pressured around the turn and lost command at the quarter pole, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and got edged
for the place. COMPLETE CONTROL raced a bit green early and dropped back, raced four wide then tipped out into the five path entering the stretch and
showed a mild rally. BIG STRETCH forwardly placed from outside, traveled four deep on the turn and weakened. SENSIBLE CAT was a bit fractious in the
gate, broke a bit slow at the beginning then chased the speed from the inside into and around the bend and weakened in the late stages. BIG CHICK
chased three wide to the lane and faded. HERE COMES RALPHIE settled off the pace, moved into the two path on the turn, came out in the stretch and
could not rally. SIDEWAYS SUANCES off slow to begin, lacked early speed up the backstretch, went five wide through the turn and was always outrun.
SHEILA'S CHARLIE exited the bend four wide and had little left for stretch run.

bumped from the outside in the lane then drifted out and finished well to earn the place. LUVLUV bumped leaving the gate, stalked off the rail, bid between
and vied around the far turn and into the stretch but was outkicked in the final furlong. TROPICAL TERROR off a bit slow to begin, forced out and bumped
near the half-mile marker, came four wide into the stretch and finished willingly. FLY BUDDY FLY went four wide into the first turn, three wide into the
stretch, lugged in and bumped rival in the lane then floated out by that same foe and flattened. N. K. ROCKET MAN had early speed and entered the first
turn four wide, moved clear and angled in, showed the way up the backstretch, vied for command around the far turn and into the stretch and retreated in
the lane. MAMBA COOL stalked from the inside, steadied past the seven-sixteenths pole, remained inside and steadied again past the five-sixteenths pole,

into the lane and had nothing left. I AM INNOCENT came out and bumped rival at the half-mile marker, went three wide into the stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
BIG FISH angled in and raced off the pace early, raced between rivals at the three-eighths, angled three wide on the far turn, lugged out then back in and
edged clear late. EBEKO (IRE) unhurried in the beginning and steered to the inside, took closer order up the backstretch, saved ground into the lane, tipped
out and closed well to edge AMBIVALENT for the place. AMBIVALENT forwardly placed behind the lone leader, bid outside and headed rival at the quarter
pole, challenged through the drive and finished gamely while getting edged for the place. GET HER NUMBER set the pace inside, met the challenge from
AMBIVALENT around the far turn, fought back through the drive and yielded grudgingly late. COTOPAXI (IRE) tucked inside on the first turn, angled three
wide into the stretch and finished well to gain ground late. ROMBAUER bumped leaving the gate, settled outside a rival then steadied off heels early, went
four wide into the far turn then five wide into the stretch and showed a mild response. NONE ABOVE THE LAW broke out and bumped leaving the gate,
traveled in the two path then moved out three wide, angled out and raced four deep on the far turn and went evenly through the late stages. C'MON JENNA
stalked the pace from the inside, saved ground into the stretch and retreated. HERD IMMUNITY stalked outside a rival, three deep into the second turn,
dropped back into the stretch and faded. INNER GHOST fractious in the gate, tracked a bit off the rail then outside a rival, moved out into the three path
then two wide around the far turn and was never a factor. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
DR. SCHIVEL attended the pace from the outside, vied three deep around the turn and gained command at the quarter pole, put to left-handed urging in
upper stretch and edged clear. SPIELBERG set the pace under pressure, responded when challenged around the bend and vied inside to the stretch,
fought back but could not go on with the winner in the final furlong while clearly second best. WESTON off alertly and pressed the pace outside the leader,
vied between foes around the bend, proved no match for the top pair in the lane but stayed on for the show. SCOOBY bumped leaving the gate, track off
the rail, chased three deep into the turn, three to four wide entering the stretch and lacked a rally. DYN O MITE chased the top trio to the turn while inside a
pair of rivals, raced along the rail then moved out into the two path and never produced a bid. DIXIE'S TWO STENTS broke in and bumped leaving the gate,
showed early speed then took back into a stalking position, went between rivals into the turn, three wide into the stretch and faded.

and got edged for the place. AVALANCHE settled off the pace off the inside, went five wide around the far turn and showed a mild response to gain a minor
award. KLONDIKE CREEK fractious in the gate, settled along the inside then moved closer into the far turn, moved out into the three path on the far turn
and kept on through the final furlong but needed to find more in deep stretch. COLOSI broke out and bumped rival at the start, vied three deep then stalked
just off the lead to the outside, bid around the far turn and gained a short lead at the quarter pole, fought with rival into the drive and folded in the final
furlong. CONQUEST COBRA raced off the pace and outside a rival, traveled between foes on the backstretch and second turn, bumped from the inside into
the stretch and could not find the needed rally. PUBILIUS SYRUS trailed the field along the inside, came out at the three-sixteenths pole and passed tired
foes. MITHQAAL stalked the pace a bit off the rail, lacked room around the second turn and then steadied in upper stretch, angled out and could not regain
momentum. FABOZZI chased near the inside, angled out and bumped rival and checked into the stretch, angled out in the lane and had nothing left. R CHA

in the lane. I'M BUSY vied for the lead from the inside then inched ahead to set the pace, showed the way with company to the outside up the backstretch,
lost the lead at the five-sixteenths pole, dropped back and also tired. HAND TIMED.
