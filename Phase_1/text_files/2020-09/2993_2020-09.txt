the three path into the stretch and faded late. CANT BUY COOL close up inside, shifted to the four path near mid stretch and lacked the needed response.

engage the runner up at the top of the stretch, matched stride to the wire and proved best while fully extended. MASQUERADE PARTY away alertly, set a
pressured pace along the inside, dug in determinedly when joined by the winner and just missed hanging on. BAR STOOL BUDGET bobbled at the start,
was unhurried then rallied steadily through the stretch in the five path. OUTTHINK'EM trailed into the stretch and passed tiring rivals late. MASCHERATO
had brief speed. EMPTY PRIZE pressed the pace two wide for a half then flattened out late.

SHORE OF EDEN broke in full stride to set all the pace and maintained her advantage under a strong hand ride. CHECK OUT LINE never far back, began
to close on the turn, inched closer in the four path and finished second best. SO GO MY LUCEILLE close up inside down the backstretch, dropped back on
the turn then came on again late in the five path. PISTOL PACKIN BOS failed to menace. CIRCLE WILL RUN was no factor. ROLLIN SO WICKED
pressured the winner two wide for a half then flattened out.
