outside and was gaining to the end. NATURAL HABITAT broke outward and bumped CLASSY MISTRESS then veered back in, raced from off the pace
along the rail, chased into the the stretch then finished a under a determined drive inside. WILLED, off slowly, up up to take a short lead, set a pressured
pace, was joined at the top of the stretch, was passed quickly by DELIGHTFUL DREAMER and faded. SCREEN DIVA, off slowly, forced the pace two-wide,

Footnotes
MAMBOINTHEFOREST pressed the pace, lapped onto the leader late turn, had command upper stretch then held under a drive. KING CAUSEWAY
stalked the pace, chased late turn then gained steadily through the stretch and got up for place. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) exchanged bumps with horses on
both sides leaving the gate, raced in mid pack, came two to four-wide through the turn then rallied gamely. NESTLETON HUSH was rated off the pace, was
hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then closed showing some interest late. KITTEN'S BOY, in range, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn
then rallied widest through the stretch. COMIC KITTEN bumped lightly with LORD WIMBORNE at the start, set a pressured pace, was headed upper
stretch, chased briefly and evened out. AM PREPARED, off slowly, settled in mid pack, saved ground on the turn but failed to menace. UNO CHAMP broke
outward and bumped LORD WIMBORNE then was rated off the pace, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
HELIUM came up inside a rival soon after the start, dueled with that one before getting clear at the top of the lane, repelled a challenge by the place horse in
upper stretch and held safe to the wire. EXCELLORATOR was hard held between runners in behind the early duelers, settled in to a pocket trip behind that
duo, angled out when room appeared turning for home and appeared dangerous but the winner had more left, no match but a clear second best. LENNY K
stalked three wide early, between runners chasing on the turn, drifted out into the four path turning for home and was a bit green down the lane, laying in but
up for the show spot by the sixteenth pole, the top pair clear. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS pressed the pace outside the winner until midway on the turn,
dropped back gradually from there to upper stretch, hanging around for a minor award. MARITIME MISSION trailed by a wide margin until late on the turn,
rallied into the stretch and was closing ground late after switching leads. AMERICAN GREAT came from off the pace three to four wide on the turn, rallying
mildly down the lane but never threatening. AMANOFMYSTATURE stalked four wide down the backside and stayed in contention until midway on the turn,
losing ground from that point. POLTERER closed along the inside into a mid pack position on the turn but had no further response when asked to continue
his rally.

Footnotes
IL MALOCCHIO broke outward then settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, swept to the lead a 16th out
and finished under a hand ride. SUNSPRITE set a pressured pace, shook clear into the stretch, was passed a 16th out but held place.
HOWMUCHISTOOMUCH raced in mid pack, chased hard four and five-wide on the far turn and finished under a determined drive. SILENT BUT VIOLENT
settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide through the far turn then rallied willingly from the outside. MUM'S THE WORD, off slowly, closed to mid
pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn then failed to menace in the stretch. SILENT GUROO stalked the pace, chased hard three and four-wide on the final
turn but evened out in the final furlong. HATMAKER HOLIDAY pressed the pace, was hustled two and three-wide after the speedster late turn but flattened
out in the stretch. FLAWLESS PINK, away slowly and off the pace, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
SILENT POET led while restrained early, was hooked and dueled with a rival late backstretch and around the turn, shook off that one by upper stretch and
held a clear margin to the wire, no challenger developing in the final stages. REAL MONEY stalked the winner early, engaged that rival late backstretch and
around the turn, began to lose touch in upper stretch and was desperate to hold the place spot late, winning a head bob for second. LOOKIN TO STRIKE
broke out at the start, settled in the two path chasing the dueling leaders around the turn, tipped out to look dangerous turning for home but could only inch
up on the place horse late, losing a tight photo and settling for the show spot. ESKIMINZIN chased the duelers along the inside, came out entering the
stretch to take his shot but couldn't quicken, running evenly down to the wire staying in fourth position. ROSE'S VISION trailed throughout, rallying gradually
inside down the lane to pass a few rivals, no threat to the top four. SILENT JIMMIE settled in mid pack, was floated four wide into the turn and three wide
drifting out mid turn, never able to enter contention. THOR'S ROCKET broke slow and ran up to chase the leaders three wide between rivals into the turn,
stayed in the three path before drifting out into the five to six path turning for home, never able to put in a bid of any sort.

AVOMAN was off slowly and settled at the back of the pack, closed three-wide on the far turn, rallied, led a 16th out and finished under a hand ride. ALL
CANADIAN pressed the pace, took the lead three-wide late on the far turn, was all out in the stretch but failed to contain the winner with a 16th to run.
DRAGON'S BREW broke outward and settled at the rear, bore out into the first turn, remained five-wide, closed five and six-wide on the far turn, drifted out
at the top of the stretch, got straightened away and rallied gamely. EXCEED lost his path leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail on
the final turn then finished gamely. TOOK A WRONG TURN raced in striking range, closed into the far turn, was hustled four-wide then finished evenly. DE
ONLY SOLUTION led into the first turn, set a pressured pace, was passed late on the far turn, chased into the stretch then flattened out with a furlong on
tap. UNLIMITED TALENT forced the issue, dropped back late turn and faded through the stretch.

Footnotes
DREAM MAKER stalked the pace, chased hard two to four-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch, was full out and had command a 16th out.
TIMESKIP, off a step slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled on the far turn, angled out upper stretch, rallied, but was outkicked. FARAWAY KITTEN
stalked the pace in hand, closed three-wide on the far turn, bid at the top of the stretch, dueled, but was passed a 16th out. MAGIC TAPIT set a reserved
pace, was headed near the far turn, forced the issue, gained a short lead at the head of the stretch, was determined but gave way grudgingly when passed
by the winner a 16th out. VIEWFINDER, off slowly, closed outside rivals on the backstretch, gained a short lead on the turn, was joined near the top of the
stretch and could not sustain his best stride in the late stages. REVVED UP, steadied at the start, settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the far turn
then evened out in the stretch. GIGANTIC BREEZE got away slowly, raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
KNIGHT KINGDOM broke slowly, raced in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, rallied gamely and was up in the late
stages. GIANT WATERS, off a step slowly, raced from off the pace was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn, rallied outside, was closing determinedly
but missed. HIATUS stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide on the far turn, angled out a bit upper stretch, bid a 16th out but was outkicked.
GALVASTON, off slowly but in striking range, was hustled three-wide on the far turn, bid approaching the stretch, was headed, chased to the late stages
and evened out. BREATHLESSNTHESAND moved up inside the pacesetter on the backstretch, took command early on the far turn, shook clear of bidders
at the top of the stretch but was passed in the final 16th. MAAKWA, making his way to an early lead, veered inward and herded BREATHLESSNTHESAND
who bothered two rival to his inside, then veered back out, set a reserved pace, led the way from off the rail on the backstretch, was joined early on the turn,
dueled, was headed at the top of the stretch, chased, ducked in and out then evened out late. QUANTUM VELOCITY hopped out of the gate and lost his
path, settled in mid pack, closed along the rail on the far turn but his rally stalled in the stretch. LIL BIT GANGSTA was checked early when
BREATHLESSNTHESAND was herded inward and bothered him and LYRICAL GANGSTER which left them running from off the pace, was hustled along
the rail on the far turn then rallied willingly and closed a gap. LYRICAL GANGSTER was checked alongside LIL BIT GANGSTA in the early going, settled off
the pace, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. SOCIAL JUSTICE steadied at the outset and settled off the
pace, saved ground on the far turn but tired in the stretch.
