MAHOMES settled well, advanced on the far turn, dueled int the stretch and gained the nod on the wire. IDEOLOGY set a contested pace, was challenged
on the far turn, dug in stubbornly and missed. PISTOL PACKIN MAN reserved, commenced his bid on the far turn and lodged a mild four wide rally in the
stretch. LITE SWITCH was void of speed. OXDAY forced the pace and dropped back at the three-eighths pole. COBYMEISTER was never involved.
