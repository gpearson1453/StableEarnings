Footnotes
KIM'S DIAMOND rounded the opening turn in the four path then closed to the front three wide at the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms from that point
and raced at a close disadvantage still three wide on the far turn, dug in for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and edged clear under the wire. TINA'S SONG
rated a slim lead inside and was met at, and dueled at even terms toward the three eighths pole, contested the rail on the far turn, gave up the lead just
inside the sixteenths pole and reluctantly ceded later yards. SPOOKY MOON stalked the early pace two deep then challenged toward the three eighths
pole, contested the far turn at near even terms while two deep and between horses and finished evenly to gain on the runner-up. MASTERDANCER
rounded the opening turn about the five path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and kept aim to the quarter,
faded on the far turn but came back a bit to finish evenly. LADYS CROSS FIRST saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced
near the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. ROAD TO GREATNESS raced well off the pace in the four and five paths the first turn then never factored.
TIP TOP DIVA was well off the pace and never a factor. SISTER HOLLIE stalked the early pace in the three path then gave way leaving the three eighths
pole.

Footnotes
KATIE'S BAYOU took quick control to rate the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and held on well.
SAINTE THERESE rounded the first turn in the four path then settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, came
through the far turn just off the rail, couldn't improve on the winner but held on for second. SWEET TWEET raced in the five path the first turn and settled off
the pace into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the three path and was gaining late on the
runner-up. VONDA settled off the pace saving ground, bid into the backstretch and raced at the rail on the far turn then finished evenly. TAVRIDA raced well
off the pace about the four path the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, angled to the outside leaving the far turn and showed little more. GOLDEN
VALE steadied shortly after the start then drifted to the six path into the first turn, raced toward the outside into the backstretch and showed little response.
GINGERESK rated close to the early pace, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole then faded on the far turn. PICTURA stalked the early pace from the
two and three paths then faded past the three eighths pole.

Footnotes
BUSTED HALO raced clear and angled to the inside to rate the pace, was pressured leaving the five sixteenths pole and dug in under a determined drive to
hold off the game stretch challenge of WINNING SCHOLAR, who stalked the pace from the three path and started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
loomed a close factor three wide on the far turn and dug in gamely to the finish. MELDON settled close in the three path the first turn and raced toward the
outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, appeared a close factor four wide on the far turn, dueled for third mid-stretch and finished
evenly. TWOBITSARIDE stalked the pace inside then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at a close disadvantage nearest
the rail but flattened stride the final furlong. WHERE'S THE LIME raced well off the pace mostly saving ground and flattened stride inside the eighth pole.
TAMAQUA saved ground off the early pace then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and finished evenly.
ALLEN JR. raced well off the pace and left the opening turn outside, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about
the six path and finished evenly. RAVIN' MAVEN rounded the first turn in the three path, showed only mild response through the backstretch, came through
the far turn off the rail then weakened.

Footnotes
BOCA BIRDIE settled back off the rail the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, started her bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily
progressed in the four path of the far turn, dug in for the lead later yards and raced clear under the wire. PAINT IT GREEN hesitated and broke outward
leaving the gate then settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn,
dueled to a slim brief lead mid-stretch, though ceded later yards. BECOMING MACHEN angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing
the quarter pole, remained clear at the rail rounding the far turn, dug in from the top of the lane but was caught flattening stride mid-stretch. BUFF N stalked
the pace inside then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened stride. SHE'S RIGHT stalked the
pace off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened stride. ELLIE BEAR was never a factor.
PAINTED ROCKET raced well back.

NEVER COMPROMISE raced in the six path the first turn and settled outside entering the backstretch, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn five wide, dug in for the lead the final yards and was clear at the wire. DOCTOR MCCOY raced off the pace in the four path the opening
turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and remained in the four path of the far turn, then dug in for second later yards while being outfinished for the
win. SHOWTIME CAT was hustled through the front stretch and rated the pace inside from the five eighths pole, came under pressure nearing the three
eighths, raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in to steady encouragement leaving the turn but was caught the final yards and just held on for third.
SPUNMAN raced in the four path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, finished evenly and just missed third.
OFFICER UNBRIDLED stalked the pace in the three path the first turn then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on
the far turn then flattened stride the final furlong. REMYS SHOWTIME stalked the early pace off the rail, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little more. ASK ME HOW IKNOW raced well back saving ground and showed little response through
the backstretch. FOREVER TAKES TIME stalked the earlier pace inside then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded toward the far turn.
GHOST MINE saved ground and showed little response. SANDSTONE ROCKSTAR drifted to the eight path into the first turn and never factored.

Footnotes
INDIAN FIBER was hustled to the front leaving the three eighths pole, raced clear toward the quarter, widened on the turn and held well under steady
stretch handling. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW gave early chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the three path then angled to the six path to get
around the drifting Mesmerizingpegasus entering the stretch, and dug in to take second the final strides. WE LOVE NANNI chased the pace and raced at
the rail on the turn but flattened stride later yards. QUEEN BOBBY gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the six and seven paths and
raced evenly down the lane. ALLEGHENY DBL LIME chased the leaders and rounded the turn about the four path, then finished evenly to improve her
position. CROSSBOW'S WILDCAT gave distant chase and was outrun. WILD CAPPUCINO was never a factor and rounded the turn near the rail.
MESMERIZINGPEGASUS set the pace the opening three sixteenths of a mile then gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, but drifted out approaching
the top of the lane and weakened. DOVES OUT gave chase down the backstretch then faded in the five path of the turn.

Footnotes
CHARITABLE SPENNY rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, widened on the far turn and proved much the best.
STEP OUT DANCING saved early ground then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid from the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the seven path of
the far turn and settled for second best. BLACK STEEL settled off the pace about the four path then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, but,
dropped back through the far turn and flattened stride the final furlong. CASTLES TRICK raced well back then bid approaching the five sixteenths pole,
came through the far turn in the five path and passed some rivals. CUBIC SOUND saved ground early on then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving
the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the three path then flattened. SCOTTISH MAN settled well back then gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and weakened. SIENTE EL VIENTO raced off the early pace about the three path then picked up the
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, but showed little response. OWEN'S WAY settled back about the three path, bid mildly from the seven sixteenths
pole then flattened at the rail on the far turn. MORGAN COUNTY stalked the pace from the three and four paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths
then weakened on the far turn. CATCH MY CABOOSE stalked the pace three and four wide but dropped back through the second turn, raced outside into
the backstretch and continued to fade. It was confirmed after an inquiry by the Stewards that the bit broke and the rider bailed in the vicinity of the eighth
pole.

Footnotes
CATHERINES WARRIOR angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms, but dropped
back approaching the quarter pole, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn, recovered the edge in the upper stretch, raced clear a
sixteenth away and widened later yards. HENDAYA stalked the pace off the rail then challenged toward the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms,
took the edge nearing the quarter pole and contested the far turn two deep, was caught in the upper stretch, dropped back mid-stretch then drifted in later
yards. DYNAMIC UNION saved ground off the pace then bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased three wide into the
stretch, was forced outward in later yards and just managed to hold third. JEAN GREY settled off the earlier pace in the three path then bid into the
backstretch, angled to the five path on the far turn, finished well at the outside poll of Dynamic Union and just missed third. JET SETTIN LADY saved
ground well off the early pace then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, eased outward through the upper
stretch then steadied off the heels of Dynamic Union later yards. KIM'S PET raced outside into the backstretch and bid nearing the three eighths pole, but
flattened in the six path of the far turn. COURTESY SHUFFLE raced off the pace in the three and four paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole then
flattened stride on the far turn. SHALL WE DANCE was not a factor. TORNERO stalked the early pace from the three path, picked up the chase toward the
three eighths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn. FLEETRESS was not a factor.
