Footnotes
POWER BANKER was last early, moved up to mid pack on the turn, angled out for room in late stretch and fired well to gain the win. MISS TREATED
STAR chased from inside, came into the stretch in the three path, led at the eighth pole and was game but nailed at the wire. MY PINK BABY BIRD waited
till the turn, gained in the four path on the turn, came on in late stretch and held the show position. IT WILL HAPPEN led to deep stretch and lacked fight
nearing the wire while inside. NANA ROZE chased from off the pace while inside, gained good momentum on the turn but flattened out at the eighth pole
inside. GINGERMYSISTER was no threat. JOSHEN XPRESS was close up to mid turn and backed up.

BOURBON NATIVE secured the perfect spot to the turn, rallied into stretch with a late burst to go clear under good handling. PRICE TO PAY good break,
inside trip throughout with a late run for place. MISTER CARSON good speed to the front, held to deep stretch but faltered late. REAGANIZE hustled along
outside to the turn, could not keep up while evenly in the drive. RUSHINGUY was off tardy, far back to turn, rallied outside and only improved late.
HALABOUTTHAT dueled to the stretch but gave way in the stretch run. JUDGE HUDSON never a factor while off rail into stretch while no menace. HOUSE
KEY never close at any point while wide into stretch and no menace.

PASSALLTHECANDY was the speed off the rail to the turn, got headed entering the stretch, briefly lost the lead, vied and regained the lead, drawing off
late. MALICED prompted the winner up the backsttetch, led briefly entering the stretch, vied with the winner down the lane and was put away late. QUIET
DAWN pulled while racing off the rail on the first turn, got just behind the leaders nearing the far turn, loomed a threat in the stretch but leveled out late.
SKIP AND A HOP took the four path in the first turn, came widest on the backstretch, rallied in the four path on the far turn under urging and was widest in
the stretch while improving position. INDICATING was within range to the far turn, lost position and faltered. REWARDED was off the pace to the turn and
lacked a rally. PORTRAIT OF EMMA was no threat. HONOR BAR was no threat.

SACRED STORM led inside and widenend in the stretch at the rail. SHE'S NO DRAMA pressed the winner from outside, nearly lost the place in the stretch
but found just enough late. GIRO KATE was brushed between horses at the start, urged early, went quickest on the turn in the four path and was up late in
deep stretch for show. APPEALING JULIA lracked right behind the leaders, took the four path on the turn and had a chance for place mid stretch but hung
late. JIMA'S GOLD was no factor.
