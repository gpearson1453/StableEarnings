Footnotes
PATRICK'S LASS stalked outside GO ESTRELLA, took over past the five-sixteenths and drew away steadily under a mild drive. WORLD GONE WILD
tracked outside the leaders three wide to the stretch, and rallied to be a distant second. GO ESTRELLA broke alertly and set the early pace inside, got
headed five-sixteenths out by the winner and was no match, and yielded the place. FACTS ONLY was no factor two wide. ELUSIVE EYES broke slowly and
was outrun four wide. WARRAREE hopped out of the gate, then shied in from PIPER, and was never close. GLOBAL QUEEN COCO was always outrun.
BABY LION angled widest into the lane at the back, and remained far behind. PIPER ducked in sharply at the start, showed brief speed inside and stopped.

Footnotes
BRACCIO DI FERRO received a bump from POWERFUL MOON at the start, pressed CURRENT HOPE from outside, took over approaching the stretch,
and prevailed through a long drive. CURRENT HOPE set a pressured pace slightly removed from the rail, responded when challenged by BRACCIO DI
FERRO late on the turn, and fought stubbornly to the finish. FULL SEND moved off the inside on the turn, moved further out for the drive and gained mildly
outside the top two finishers. THIRSTY'S PRIDE raced three then four wide around the turn, improved for the last major share but needed more. MY
MAXAMILLION steadied in tight leaving the half-mile marker, and posed no threat. ROYAL MEETING lost ground to the front flight two then three wide
around the bend, and made no headway widest in the lane. POWERFUL MOON broke in bumping BRACCIO DI FERRO, chased in range three wide to the
stretch, stumbled sharply near the eighth-pole, had the rider dismount on the gallop-out and was escorted back.

Footnotes
RHYTHMIA saved ground unhurried early, came off cover entering the far turn, ran past rivals four wide to join the leaders a quarter-mile out, overtook
HERO UP through the furlong grounds and edged away under pressure. HERO UP cleared to the lead and moved inside going to the first turn, saw a good
portion of his advantage whittled away around the far turn, could not withstand the winner in mid stretch, but dug in gamely for the place. TIL THE END
broke in nudging MOZO BELLO into DOMINATE THEMOMENT, settled well off the early pace three wide, moved out another path on the far turn, and
rallied to get up for the show on the far outside. MOZO BELLO got pushed into DOMINATE THEMOMENT by TIL THE END at the start, rallied three wide to
loom a threat after six furlongs, but could not sustain the bid. DOMINATE THEMOMENT was bumped by MOZO BELLO at the start, advanced four wide
after six furlongs, ran on to deep stretch and was outkicked between horses for larger shares. ZAP DADDY lacked room behind D'CRAZINESS at the start,
raced two wide and failed to menace. NACHO PAPA chased the pacesetter from inside for a half-mile, and tired. D'CRAZINESS broke outward, stayed
close near the two-path to the lane, and tired.

Footnotes
REAL TALK lacked room behind THE RED MAN and AHIMELECH at the start, recovered to a forward position, waited for an opening midway on the turn,
split horses decisively coming to the quarter-pole, kicked away into the stretch and widened driving. THE RED MAN vied inside POLITIKUM early, yielded
along the rail past the three-eighths, moved out in upper stretch and came back on to be clearly second best. POLITIKUM contested the early pace outside
THE RED MAN, gained the upper hand briefly getting clear on the turn, was no match for the winner by the top of the stretch, and faded. AHIMELECH
broke inward, chased three wide for a half-mile, and tired. COBB raced three wide and was never involved. HICKERSON broke slowly and trailed far back.

Footnotes
REBELDE moved up a bit three wide between horses after a half-mile, stayed in the three-path turning for home, rallied inside the leaders while still well off
the rail, reached the lead about 50 yards out and prevailed narrowly. JUST KIDDING vied outside R MERCEDES BOY from the outset, was in the four-path
coming off the turn, drifted out through the late stages and just missed. R MERCEDES BOY stayed three paths off the rail contesting the pace inside JUST
KIDDING, edged away approaching the stretch, jumped back to his left lead drifting out and laboring into the final furlong, and was overhauled from both
sides. DARDANELLOS bumped with FRANK FIRST at the start, lagged well back three wide into the turn, moved out in the stretch and gained too late.
UNCAPTURED KING settled in the middle of the field two wide, cut the corner into the stretch, veered out seeing the whip in the rider's left hand coming to
the eighth-pole, and had no rally from there. CHARLIE THE GREEK was never a factor. FRANK FIRST bumped with DARDANELLOS at the start, and
faded four wide before reaching the stretch. ESPRESSO CALIENTE rushed up inside leaving the chute, and was through after a half.

FULLY LOADED moved up outside TAKE CHARGE DUDE leaving the backstretch, dueled around the turn and into the stretch, gained the upper hand and
edged clear past the furlong marker and held off FAMOUS FACT to the wire. FAMOUS FACT saved ground outsprinted to the stretch, stayed on the fence
and finished strongly to just miss. HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE was well placed behind the dueling leaders around the turn, had aim outside through the lane
and did not have quite enough. TAKE CHARGE DUDE cleared inside going to the turn, got hooked right after that by FULLY LOADED, dueled to the furlong
grounds and gave way. KYLE raced three wide, and lacked the needed late response. R BOY BODE steadied in tight entering the turn, and could not
recover. HONOLULU EXPRESS stayed in the paddock for a shoe repair delaying the start, and showed little. DIAMOND MINT steadied near the half-mile
pole, and was outrun.

Footnotes
BIG RINGS stayed close into the turn three wide, dwarfed FRANKLY MY DEAR as she overpowered that one from outside after a half-mile, shifted in
moving clear in upper stretch, and was driving to 70 yards out before being geared down. FRANKLY MY DEAR pressed GLITTER BAY from outside early,
reached the front coming to the three-eighths and moved inside, could not stay with BIG RINGS coming off the turn, moved back outside and had enough to
save second. BATTLE CRY was outrun for a half, shifted to the four-path in upper stretch, and finished evenly outside the runner-up. SHANG'S SISTER
pressed the early pace along the rail, and faded around the turn while moving out three wide. PACIFIC PRINCESS hit the left side of the gate at the start,
was outsprinted to the lane, and made no headway on the far outside. GLITTER BAY set the early pace pressed from both flanks, got headed by FRANKLY
MY DEAR near the three-eighths, and retreated. ADIOS DEE DEE trailed throughout, and dropped far back in the stretch.

Footnotes
HEIRESSALL advanced inside after a half-mile, moved out three wide past the five-sixteenths, rallied outside LIZA STAR through the stretch, reached the
front 70 yards out and edged clear. THISSMYTIME was put to a full-out drive midway on the turn, shifted out to the four-path approaching the lane, finished
determinedly and was up outside LIZA STAR for second at the wire. LIZA STAR briefly vied for command between SAYONARA BABY and COOKIE
DOUGH entering the main track, let the latter go and stalked outside, took over going comfortably a quarter-mile from home, moved clear through upper
stretch, could not hold off the winner late and was nipped for second at the line. MIDNIGHT SOIREE was outrun early near the two-path, and gained
belatedly on the far outside. COOKIE DOUGH took over inside and went clear before completing a quarter-mile, got caught by LIZA STAR late on the turn,
and gave way inside. STARSHIP BONITA saved ground and failed to reach contention. REAGAN'S ROSE raced three to four wide, and dropped far back
after a half. SAYONARA BABY had a short lead early outside rivals, stayed close into the turn three wide, but was finished before reaching the stretch.

HEIR BALL broke out, cleared off from ALL ABOUT STELLA and moved inside entering the turn, fended off THINKIN COWTOWN past the quarter-pole and
went clear again, and was under a hand drive through the stretch to hold sway. PRECOCIOUS PEACH was close up heading to the turn but got shuffled
back considerably, stayed inside rallying into the stretch, came out to the two-path late and was gaining outside the winner. THINKIN COWTOWN shied out
at the start, pressed HEIR BALL from outside, got shaken off into the lane and was outkicked for second. ALL ABOUT STELLA raced in striking range two
wide to the stretch, and could not gain with an even finish. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT was outrun two then three wide around the turn, and passed tired

NOBLE DRAMA absorbed bumps from both sides at the start and was slow to get going, began moving in earnest four wide after a half-mile, rallied outside
TRAVY BOY through the furlong grounds, and drew clear through the late stages. TRAVY BOY sprinted clear after an alert beginning, rated along well off
the rail to the stretch, drifted out steadily and stayed on for the place. GARTER AND TIE broke out bumping NOBLE DRAMA and was slow to begin, swung
four wide leaving the turn, and was just up for the show well out in the track. SQUEEZADIOS moved inward around the turn, and made no late headway
inside the leaders. RED CRESCENT gave chase outside TRAVY BOY to the stretch, and faded out past the middle of the track. QUENANE broke in
bumping NOBLE DRAMA, moved inside entering the turn at the back, and remained outrun. ART G IS BACK moved off the inside to the three-path around
the turn, and tired. RUNNING FOR RIZ showed speed for a half-mile, and stopped.

Footnotes
TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR tracked outside the early leaders, took over three wide coming to the quarter-pole, moved clear through upper stretch, and had just
enough to hang on. TARA advanced inside after a half-mile, moved to the two-path approaching the stretch, tipped out further with aim at TIZ POSSIBLE
DEAR after straightening away, closed in staying on her left lead and could not get up. ROYAL MEGHAN came away in good order, moved up four wide
after a half, and flattened out through the lane. KOZY DREAMS vied for command outside FLASHING DIAMOND for a half-mile, got the best of that dispute
as she was being overhauled from outside by the eventual winner, and gave way through the stretch. BIMINI raced in the two-path and posed no threat.
TIME TO TWO STEP hesitated at the start and was off behind the field, and never got close. SHES ALL WOMAN veered out at the start, raced three wide
and tired after a half. MISSCHIEF MAAS broke slowly and was always far back. FILLY JEAN KING broke out, raced four to five wide around the turn, and
dropped far back in the stretch. FLASHING DIAMOND vied inside KOZY DREAMS for a half, gave way through the rest of the turn, and was eased up in the
stretch.
