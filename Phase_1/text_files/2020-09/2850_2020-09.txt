Footnotes
GOLDEN GRANT was allowed to settle early while three wide, made a three wide move on the turn while in hand, assumed command past the furlong
marker then drew off smartly under a mild drive. SHOWSTOMPER was allowed to settle early while three wide, swung out five wide at the top of the stretch
to rally for the place, no match to winner while being clearly second best. ROCK OUT stumbled slightly at the start, then was sent up to dispute the pace,
drew clear on the turn while moving to the rail, weakened in the drive. SLEWPY'S HALO was away alertly, sent to lead while three wide, then raced two
wide on the turn while tiring. TALENTED TAPPER had no response while racing on the inside.

Footnotes
CJ'S BILLY'SEMPIRE stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the far turn to duel for the lead, then prevailed late after a long drive to prove best
in a game effort, driving. RAMPAGE pressed the early pace an d made a three wide bid on the far turn, then had a long stretch drive with the winner to just
miss. PASS THE BISCUITS set a pressured pace, then dueled for the lead on the turn towards the inside, gave way grudgingly in the stretch, bested rest.
OUR BALDY B was well placed on the inside, continued on the rail entering the stretch but lacked the needed bid. PLEASANT SUNRISE stalked the early
five wide, came into the stretch four wide and faded. JUSTICE IN VEGAS checked shortly after the start, raced four wide on the turn, swung out six wide at
the top of the stretch while no threat.

to the top two. QUIET CONTENDER was reserved early, came three wide into the stretch, was making a mild late rally before being wrapped up final
hundred yards. RUNNINAWAYWITHIT stalked the early pace four wide, then made a three wide bid on the far turn, but faded in the drive. TWO CARROT
RANSOM stalked the pace three wide then weakened. TOO CROWDED was four wide into the first turn, then chased the pace three to four wide but tired.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC CLIMB set a pressured pace early while racing off the rail, shook clear on the turn, then drew out in the stretch to prove much the best under a
drive. PRECIOUS ARCH was well placed early while saving ground, continued on the rail entering the stretch to finish well while being no match to the
winner, second best. PABLO'S MINX stalked the early pace while four wide but faded in the stretch while saving the show award. MESANGE was allowed
to settle early while three wide, came into the stretch four wide but offered no rally while passing the tiring rivals. LADY ELSA was reserved early on the
inside, angled out in the stretch while offering some late interest. MUSICAL LADY chased the pace from the inside before weakening. BOO'S GAL pressed
the early pace three wide, weakened. IMNOTSMALL offered no rally while racing three to four wide. OXBOWINDY failed to menace while four wide. DULCE
DARLING was bumped at the start, then was not a threat. CHRISTINE fractious gate, trailed.
