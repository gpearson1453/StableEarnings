BETCHA BY GOLLY , right to the front, set the pace off the rail and was under brisk urging in the drive. LADY BLAKENEY , outside horses down the
backstretch, began a move approaching the far turn, raced three deep, drifted in near the three sixteenths pole and flattened out. SUPERHELPFUL drifted
out entering the first turn, circled the far turn four wide and lacked the necessary response. GOLDEN GLOW raced inside horses, chased the pace and gave
way. LISHEEN raced between horses on the far turn while outrun. CAJOLE saved ground the first turn, raced in the three path while backing up on the far
turn then dropped far back. MY GIRL BLUE raced along the inner rail and stopped.

I'MTHETAPITNOW , sent to the early lead, set the pace near the rail, remained on his left lead in the stretch, was under brisk urging, held sway and
switched to his right lead near the sixteenth pole. GINS AND TINS , a forward factor in the two path between horses down the back stretch, was in range of
the winner turning for home and flattened out. MAKES MO CENTS stalked the pace, swung to the four path leaving the turn and lacked the necessary late
response. BENANDJOE , three wide both turns, chased the pace and gave way on the far turn. BACK TO BACK hugged the inner rail for five furlongs,
swung wide near the three eighths pole and faltered. RESIDENT LIBERAL was outrun after stumbling at the break. MINE TO HOLD was outrun.

SHACKABOOM hopped at the break, was sent to the front, saved ground around the turn, drifted out entering the stretch, lost the lead in mid stretch and
battled back late. TAM CHAR advanced in the two path mid way on the turn, was taken to the inner rail near the five sixteenths pole, gained a short lead
inside the winner mid stretch and hung. STAR OF SHANGHAI saved ground on the turn, raced in the two path through the stretch and had a mild rally
between the top pair. ACADIAN GIRL , no factor, passed tired horses. STOP TALKING had a mild, three wide move leaving the turn, drifted in near the
three sixteenths pole and gave way. GOLDEN MOON SHINE prompted the pace and gave way. SLIP SLIDIN chased early, failed to keep pace on the turn
while hugging the rail and checked behind TAM CHAR near the five sixteenths pole before dropping back. An objection by the rider of SLIP SLIDIN against
TAM CHAR for alleged interference on the turn was not allowed.

Footnotes
OLDIES BUT GOODIES stalked the pace, raced three wide on the turn, advanced outside horses, was brushed by BLESSED ARION in deep stretch and
was up in time. ZYRAMID sped to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, set a pressured pace along the rail and gave way
grudgingly. BLESSED ARION prompted the pace two wide around the turn, battled in the stretch, brushed the winner when drifting out late and finished
gamely. LOST IN LIMBO raced near the rail around the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and rallied late outside horses. BULL SHARK raced
along the inner rail most of the race and was not a factor. MISSIN THE BIG DOG circled the turn, was four deep entering the stretch and failed to be a
factor.

ON THE TOWN stalked the pace, advanced in the three path to take the led leaving the far turn, and dug in stubbornly through the stretch to prevail. MONA
LUNA stalked the pace under patient handling between horses, eased out to the four path leaving the far turn, flattened out, returned sore and was vanned
off. INSIDE THE BOX lacked speed, worked between horses leaving the far turn, angled out and flattened out. CURLY RUTH lacked speed, angled to the
four path in upper stretch and failed to menace. SAVEDBYTHEBELLE lacked speed, race four deep leaving the far turn and failed to rally. MISS CHLOE G
prompted the pace two wide, gained a short lead on the far turn and tired the final furlong. CALL ON CLARA was no factor. MIKE'S GIRL , an early factor
along the inner rail, faltered on the far turn. WHO U GONNA CALL , taken to the inner rail after sprinting clear into the backstretch, faltered leaving the far
turn.
