Footnotes
LIGHT US UP raced off the pace inside, advanced outside on the far turn, rallied four wide into the lane, dug in gamely outside, gained a short lead past
midstretch and then held on. DEMOCRATIC NORMS raced off the pace inside, advanced on the turn, moved up inside entering the stretch, steadied when
lacking room behind horses near the sixteenth marker, then angled out and surged late outside. LIZARD KING raced off the pace outside a rival, rallied
three wide into the lane and dug in gamely between rivals in deep stretch. SO DIALED IN showed good early speed to clear the field, opened up a long
lead, showed the way on the far turn, dug in to midstretch, then weakened. FINANCIAL GAIN stumbled badly at the start, stalked the pacesetter and gave
way. ESPECIALLEA raced four wide early, then stalked outside and gave way. A Jockey Objection by the rider of DEMOCRATIC NORMS against the

SUZ quickly showed in front, set the pace racing with a clear lead, drew off and was kept to the task in the lane. DO WHAT IT TAKES chased three wide
early, raced between rivals on the turn, rallied and was clear for the place award. LITTLEBITALILY chased four wide early, raced five wide on the turn,
finished evenly in the stretch and bested the others. BEE'SNBEE'S bobbled at the break, chased between rivals, chased on the turn and weakened.
LIGHTS DOWN LOW chased on the rail, dropped back on the turn and failed to threaten. MZ. FOO DO was squeezed and steadied at the start, then
rushed up into contention on the backside, bid four wide entering the turn, chased and weakened in the lane. ENDUROS TIGRESS was bumped at the
start, raced two wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. TAKE CHARGE AGAIN raced off the pace, four wide on the turn and did
not factor.

Footnotes
LIL COMMISSIONER stalked close up outside, then pressed the pace, bid two wide nearing the far turn, took charge, drew off under urging, was kept to the
task in the lane and shown the whip through the final sixteenth to hold sway. MARKSMAN raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the far turn, rallied
three wide into the lane and closed the gap in deep stretch. THAT QUALITY bobbled at the break, set the pace on the inside, was no match for the winner
on the far turn and faded. GRAND MEISTER trailed the field, moved up a bit on the far turn, then gave way and was eased up late.
