Footnotes
C. P. A. GENIUS broke in bumping TIZ THE DUDE, grabbed the lead and moved inside, shook off pursuers after three-eighths of a mile, and widened
under a drive. CONVERTER bumped with TIZ THE DUDE at the start, sat behind the leaders around the turn, came through between horses with aim
outside C. P. A. GENIUS at the top of the stretch, and went clear of the others while unable to seriously menace the top one. KHOCU pressed the pace
outside C. P. A. GENIUS for three furlongs, and got shaken off into the lane. VALEROSO moved in from the four-path around the turn tightening things up
on YOUNG THOMAS near the quarter-pole, and ran on evenly along the rail late. FREELANCE faded three wide approaching the stretch. YOUNG
THOMAS checked sharply on the rail inside VALEROSO a quarter-mile out, and dropped back. DUEL FUEL moved off the inside around the turn, and
made no impact. TIZ THE DUDE was bumped between CONVERTER and C. P. A. GENIUS at the start, checked past the half-mile pole in the three-path,
and dropped back. NEW ACCOUNT broke behind the field, and remained far back. HIGHLY NOTED tired around the turn four wide. LITTLE STORM GODS
was always outrun.

SAYONARA BABY veered out at the start as a lightning bolt sent the field on their way, chased four to five wide to the stretch, finished determinedly and
was along in time on the far outside. SAMMY'S TOWN was never far back while three to four wide, bid between horses through the furlong grounds, and
was outkicked just inside the winner. HY DOLLFACE vied for early command between horses, took over approaching the five-sixteenths and went clear,
stayed on to deep stretch and yielded inside the top two. BETTERTHENYOURX moved off the rail to the two-path around the turn, and lacked the needed
rally. FOLLOW ME MOM dueled early inside, got outpaced around the turn, and faded on the rail after three furlongs.

Footnotes
RESIDENT slipped through along the rail to join the leaders past the five-sixteenths, drew clear through upper stretch and held sway under a drive.
TRAPPEZOID advanced to loom a threat four wide late on the turn, could not go with RESIDENT after straightening away for the drive, and was clearly
second best. FOURTH DESIGN pressed the early pace, reached a short lead between horses after a half-mile, and weakened in the stretch. BLACK
PEPPER was a step slow at the start, and made no impact in the two-path. MR WRENCH IT was at the back when the rider lost the whip passing the
three-eighths, and made no headway through the stretch on the far outside. SMOKE 'N' GLOAT hustled to the front early, got overhauled from both sides
midway on the turn, and dropped back. GEMOLOGISTER tired after a half-mile three wide.

Footnotes
TWILIGHT stayed in range early, began moving in the four-path turning for home, caught K'S RUNNING FREE from outside with a sixteenth to go and drew
off. K'S RUNNING FREE swept up to seize command with a four-wide run approaching the five-sixteenths, settled into the stretch well clear, drifted out past
the eighth-pole staying on her left lead, was no match for the winner and saved the place. GALWAY CITY was sent up along the inside to vie with
PLATINUMCENTS heading to the half-mile marker, got past that rival after five furlongs while simultaneously being overwhelmed by K'S RUNNING FREE,
weakened inside and had enough to stay clear of the others. SHE'S A LADY GRIZ saved ground for six furlongs, and lacked the needed response.
CHARDRENEE veered out sharply at the start, came under a ride entering the turn but was outpaced, and faded in the five-path before reaching the stretch.
PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER was forced out by CHARDRENEE at the start, and was outrun five to six wide. PLATINUMCENTS led early well out in the track,
got headed by GALWAY CITY approaching the turn, and faltered after six furlongs.

Footnotes
CURRENT HOPE broke alertly and pressed LITTLE DUDE from outside, took over after three-eighths of a mile, drew off through the stretch under a drive
and was geared down 70 yards out. LITTLE DUDE broke out into GO MIKE, set a pressured pace in the two-path inside CURRENT HOPE, proved no
match coming off the turn, and ran on best of the rest. DREAMING THOUSAND bobbled and broke out at the start, lost ground to the leaders three wide
under a drive on the turn, and did enough late to get the show between horses. PAPA HONOR was forced out by DREAMING THOUSAND at the start, and
faded in the four-path after three furlongs. THIRSTY'S PRIDE stayed in range early, and faded inside through the lane. GO MIKE got sideswiped by LITTLE
DUDE and checked back at the start, and was finished early. GO ORTEGO GO retired early inside.

Footnotes
DANVILLE was never far back, came through along the rail to wrest command from DILLON ROCKS after six furlongs, drew clear through upper stretch
and widened under pressure. BUDGET BUSTER brushed with DILLON ROCKS at the start, raced extremely wide around the turn perhaps in the eight-path
or so, and was up for second between horses late. DILLON ROCKS brushed with BUDGET BUSTER at the start, forced the early pace outside, poked a
head in front after a half-mile in the three-path, could not withstand the winner turning for home, and drifted out while weakening. DEVOTED KITTEN raced
well back early, came six or seven wide off the turn, and improved on the far outside for the last major share. UNCAPTURED KING pressed the pace in the
four-path, and faded after six furlongs. NOTSOSUBTLE moved out five wide late on the turn, and lacked the needed response. TEXTPECTATION was slow
into stride, came off the turn far back and extremely wide, and passed tired horses. KID DRAMA saved ground to no avail. IM THE CAPTAIN NOW was
through early. ELVIS COLE vied up front early in the two-path, and gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
TATWEEJ tracked outside the early leaders three wide, took over going comfortably five-sixteenths out, was roused into the stretch and wandered out
briefly, straightened out under right-handed pressure and stayed in command. BREWMEISTER advanced while moving off the inside to the three-path after
six furlongs, finished willingly and could not seriously threaten the winner. GLORY OF FLORIDA was urged along four wide entering the turn, loomed a
threat at the top of the stretch, but flattened out through the late stages. I'M A G SIX raced near the three-path around the turn, checked behind
BREWMEISTER unable to hold his spot past the quarter-pole, and could not recover. EXAMINER pressed AFRICAN HERITAGE from outside early, lodged
a mild bid between horses entering the turn, but gave way after six furlongs. AFRICAN HERITAGE was sent hard for the early lead inside, could not stave
off challengers after five-eighths of a mile, and retreated steadily.

Footnotes
CAPTIVANT got bumped by BENNY'S GIRLFRIEND after the start, joined the leaders entering the turn three wide between horses, moved inside dueling
with CAPTURED LIGHT at the top of the stretch, and battled back gamely on the rail to get the decision. CAPTURED LIGHT rallied four wide around the
turn, poked a head in front outside CAPTIVANT after six furlongs, edged away near the eighth-pole, then was outfinished. DARESCA raced behind the
leaders two then three wide approaching the stretch, and ran on with good courage to go clear for the show. IRISH THUNDER pressed the early pace
inside, lost ground to the leaders turning for home, weakened late and salvaged the last major share. BORROWED ANGEL was no factor inside. BENNY'S
GIRLFRIEND bumped into CAPTIVANT shortly after the start, raced in range five then four wide around the turn, and faded through the drive. NEW YORK
COMMANDER set a pressured pace in the two-path, gave way around the turn, and was eased up in the stretch.
