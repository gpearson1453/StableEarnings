Footnotes
MALIBU CURL two then three wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and seized command before
swinging just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive and finished well kept to brisk hand urging inside the final sixteenth to the wire.
BELLAMORE brushed the near side stall at the start, chased three wide from just off the pace, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch, ran on to
chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. JAMSSTAR got lightly bumped between foes at the start, chased along the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish to secure the show honors. JORDAN'S LEO hesitated at the start
getting away a beat slow and bobbling slightly inwards, chased two to three wide from the tail of the field, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun
just off the inside for home, appeared to want to tip out and had FOUETTE drift in front, opted to the rail at the three-sixteenths, rallied tepidly through a tight
seam a furlong from home, kept on for the last major share clear of the rest. TABOR HALL chased four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled
five wide into upper stretch, weakened. FOUETTE struck the off side stall at the start and came under hustling to show the way in hand along the inside,
came under pressure near the midway point on the turn and floated to the two path at the three-eighths, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, yielded
command nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, tipped out a path straightened away and tired. THISLADYIS THE LAW chased just off
the inside from mid pack, paused briefly between foes at the seven-sixteenths appearing to be briefly in tight, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BOURBON CURRENCY settled comfortably towards the rear of the field, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, moved closer passing the
five-sixteenths, coasted three wide into upper stretch, was asked while finding a seam inside the three-sixteenths, rallied under a strong hand ride, closed
strongly to get the lead into the final sixteenth and proved best under a brisk hand ride to the wire. TENURE was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on
the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, came three wide under stronger encouragement into the stretch, battled on even terms with the pacesetter
under a drive into the final furlong, gained a short lead outside the sixteenth-pole but was overtaken by the winner while able to get the place. NO BANG NO
BOOM (IRE) broke in and hit the gate then was hustled, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, spun into the two path at
the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final furlong then lost the advantage, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth, swapped back to his inside lead
shortly thereafter and was outfinished while just able to hold the show. BAD BEAT BRIAN was urged along in third position, saved ground on the turn, came
under the whip while behind the leading pair in upper stretch, tried to go between those foes at the furlong marker but didn't have enough room, waited and
steadied some while blocked to the sixteenth-pole, altered outside shortly thereafter and finished willingly to just miss the show. CARDIAC KITTEN settled
on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, chased the leaders while still on his inside lead until outside the
sixteenth-pole, swapped to the proper lead at that point and lacked the needed kick. GINS AND TINS dropped to the rear of the field then fell well behind,
saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. MANOFFIRE was last to commence then asked, settled outside towards the rear under some urging, went
three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch under a left-handed whip and was no factor. ZILLER was urged along just off the pace, dropped back
in the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch then came under the whip and failed to respond. (Rail at 18 Feet)

Footnotes
COLD HARD CASH settled into the the path heading for the crown of the clubhouse bend, ventured into the three path shortly after departing it, responded
when given some rein a sixteenth shy of the half mile pole, steadily advanced towards the ones to catch, got cued up challenging for the top as the widest of
three front runners, forged to the lead during the ensuing furlong, kicked clear, driving. STRIKING SPEED away alertly, remained forwardly placed, worked
out a tuck into the two path, was rated along prompting MAJESTIC WEST, inched up to that opponent during the opening half of the run around the far turn,
was directly abreast as the fraction was being finalized, saw the winner arrive on the scene a few strides later, vied as the middle member of a threesome
spinning into the lane, failed to claim the top, stayed on well to nail down second. FIRST RATE cut over to the rail and went on to pursue the pace from
there on the first turn, got eased to the outside and into path two soon after stepping onto the backstretch, chased the pace from the same path on turn two,
got maneuvered out four wide from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, proved no match. MAJESTIC WEST established the top after the start,
angled sharply over to the rail right after leaving the homestretch, set the splits, rated and with STRIKING SPEED in attendance in path two, saw that foe
increase his presence as three-quarters was being ratted off, was forced to fend both that rival and the eventual winner heading for the top of the lane,
yielded, steadily backed away in the final furlong. BLOOD MOON tracked the pace while saving ground, swung out three wide entering the stretch, came up
empty. BRICE secured the pocket after bobbling at the start, got lightly steadied as MAJESTIC WEST was himself taking up residence on the rail right after
exiting the homestretch, kept watch on the front runners within range, got switched over to stronger handling in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole,
cut the corner and faltered.

Footnotes
PRICE TALK in a bit tight along the rail into the first turn, tracked the pace along the inside in range, remained patiently handled in behind the leader until
roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command just outside the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive to the finish. ETHOS
established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled until let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch,
took to the rail straightened away, dug in under lone threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole, ran on to chase the winner home safe for the place
honors. AMANO broke in a step at the start and was corrected, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to procure the show honors. WINTERS BACK forwardly placed just off the inside, came under
encouragement at the five-sixteenths applying pressure to the leader, spun three wide into upper stretch and was shaken off straightened away and
weakened in the final furlong. CONGLOMERATE got floated four wide into the first turn by HOLY EMPEROR who tipped out from the two path off the heels
of WINTERS BACK, raced three wide through the opening bend before settling two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, went three wide through the far
turn coming under intermittent coaxing from the three-eighths and advanced into striking range five-sixteenths from home, angled four wide into upper
stretch still prominent, then came up empty in the drive. CEANT off half a beat slow without incident, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field through
the first turn, chased two to three wide down the backstretch before going three wide through the far turn racing outside a pair of foes and coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact while getting some education. HOLY
EMPEROR just off the inside early on in mid pack, was off the heels of WINTERS BACK into the first turn and tipped out three wide carrying
CONGLOMERATE four wide into that bend, tucked back to the two path soon after and tracked the front from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing
between rivals at the five-sixteenths, cornered three wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
JANE GREY settled in fourth position, was asked in the two path on the turn, angled four wide outside the quarter-pole then rallied five wide into the stretch,
closed fast to get the lead inside the three-sixteenths, fought outside the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong, disposed of that foe into the final
sixteenth and proved best under steady urging. LEIA MARIE bobbled at the start but broke in second position, tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up
three wide on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, took the lead briefly at the three-sixteenths then lost the advantage under a drive to the
winner, fought with that foe to the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while well clear for the place. LUTESCOOT N BOOGIE angled in while showing
speed, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the runner-up near the
three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. SHESHAPPY angled out early, settled on the far outside, was caught
five wide early on the turn then dropped to the three path before the three-eighths, passed the five-sixteenths under the whip, moved out some under a drive
in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. MO DEAN settled off the pace, was urged along while four wide on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch under a drive, drifted in inside the three-sixteenths and failed to respond. BERNING QUESTION was slow into stride, dropped well behind the rest of
the field, rounded the turn in the two path, turned into the stretch under the whip and was no factor. FEELING PRETTY broke in then was hustled to the
lead, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage passing the five-sixteenths, dropped back at the
quarter-pole and stopped. FAMILY TIME settled off the pace, moved in inside the five-eighths, paused near the half-mile pole and dropped back some,
saved ground on the turn, swung out six wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
SO GRACIOUS dove over to the rail after coming away cleanly, continued along it racing towards the back of the pack, got steered out into the two path for
entrance into the stretch, idled behind behind a horde yet managed to inch her way into contention, availed of the access to the outside provided by VEVEY
as that one was calling it a day a little past the eighth pole, fanned out wider and wider in a desperate search for optimal racing clearance, wrested away
path five from BEAN COUNTER after some contact between them in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, kicked into her best stride, shooting by several others
to get up nearing the finish line. KEOTA sneaked her way into the pocket approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, patiently kept watch, got steered
out two wide for the drive, finished with willingness en route for the place. BEAN COUNTER took up residence in the two path after the start, loped along as
the trailer all the way to the end of the bend, went into the stretch, began to move out path by path for racing room beginning from midstretch, had just taken
possession of the five path when nudged one wider by the winner with approximately a sixteenth remaining, clawed her way forward to get up for the show.
A LITTLE FAITH stayed along the inside route after the field had been released, got checked after becoming somewhat unsettled shortly afterwards, tipped
into the two path and ventured onward more professionally, came under a ride angling four wide into the lane, was right there as part of the blanket finish en
route for the last major check. BOURBON 'N DITCH away as one of the quickest, cut over to the rail, contended as the innermost of a trio for a spell before
going at it one on one with BRASS on the turn, saw the pilot go to work spinning into the lane, kicked away to lead by her largest advantage over the course
of the following eighth, came under heavy assault thereafter, succumbed inside the sixteenth marker, then weakened enough so as to finish off the board.
SWEET KISSES in between rivals disputing the pace during the initial stages, got taken back, departed the backstretch from path two and went on to stalk
the ongoing pace dispute, commenced the stretch one path farther off the inside, weakened late.. SMACK spotted along the inside early on the backstretch,
went on to save ground to no avail. BRASS RING involved in a three way tussle for the top for a good portion of the journey on the backstretch, worked out
a tuck into path two at the top of turn, sparred with ground-saving BOURBON 'N DITCH until the head of the stretch before giving way. VEVEY strung out
two to three wide on the turn, was more the latter coming into the lane, appeared done after going an additional furlong and backed away. Following a
Stewards' Inquiry focusing on SO GRACIOUS and BEAN COUNTER in deep stretch, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

CHOCOLATE COOKIE advanced after the start to be forwardly placed just off the inside through the first turn settling outside the leader along the inside,
remained patiently handled keeping closest watch on that rival, began to advance in the far turn applying pressure to the front five-sixteenths from home, got
set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, took over command at the three-sixteenths, inched away briefly to the eighth pole, dug in with a rival in
close pursuit to hold sway to the finish. MADISON PARC two to three wide through the first turn, settled just off the pace two then three wide, began to
advance through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive chasing the winner home
willingly through to the wire while clear of the rest for the place honors. DANCING KIKI tucked from the three path to the two path near the seven-eighths
pole just prior to the first turn placing CALIDAD off her heels and forcing that rival to check firmly at that station, settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid
pack, came under encouragement at the five-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch and ran on to garner the show honors. PORTOFINA tracked
the pace along the inside, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, tipped out a path a furlong out as SWEET
SNEAK backing up on the rail, then weakened in the late stages. SWEET SNEAK established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came
under pressure near the midway point on the far turn and was put to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in
getting collared at the three-sixteenths, weakened in the final furlong. SAINTE MERE EGLISE bobbled at the start recovering inwards and taking over the
lane of NOBLESQUE, raced three wide through the first turn, chased three wide from mid pack, came under urging near the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and offered no response. CALIDAD grew fractious and broke through the gate prior to the start and was reloaded, got away half a
beat slow and was put to rating, had DANCING KIKI tuck in front near the seven-eighths and was forced to check off her heels firmly skygazing under the
quick pull before able to settle just off the inside through the first turn, tracked two to three wide down the backstretch, tipped four wide into the far turn,
came under urging at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and weakened. SAIGON broke a beat slow and shied to the rail just after the
start, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, was unable to make an
impact and shied in near the sixteenth marker under an off sided stick while showing some greenness. NOBLESQUE lost her lane at the start as SAINTE
MERE EGLISE recovered inwards from a bobble, raced four wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide from near the rear down the backstretch,
went four to five wide through the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered five wide for home and tired.

LAST JUDGMENT settled in the middle of the field under some coaxing, went two then three wide early on the turn, moved to four wide around the
five-sixteenths then five wide outside the quarter-pole, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then
moved clear under steady handling. MAD MUNNYS was hustled to the lead, moved in while setting the pace, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked
outside the quarter-pole, came under a left-handed whip in upper stretch, switched to a right-handed whip outside the furlong marker, was collared outside
the sixteenth-pole and outfinished while clear for the place. MALIBU PRO tracked the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, was given his cue at
the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the whip, chased under a drive into the final furlong and weakened while just able to get the show.
LUSITANO settled on the outside, was asked while four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, pursued the leader into the final furlong and
also weakened then just missed the show. AMERICAN POWER settled towards the rear, was urged along while five wide on the turn, came six wide into
the stretch under the whip and failed to threaten. THOMAS SHELBY bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the inside, was taken under vigorous
restraint when a foe crossed in front coming to the five-eighths pole, raced under a very strong hold while tugging hard at the bit, saved ground still under
tight restraint on the turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, dropped in a bit near the furlong marker and lacked the
needed response. CREATIVE STYLE settled at the rear of the field, went three then four wide on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. TIZ HE THE ONE was well placed just off the pace, passed the half-mile pole under urging, saved ground on the turn, dropped back under a drive in
upper stretch and capitulated. RELEASETHETHUNDER bumped with a rival at the start, came out with his head held high early, settled near the back, went
two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond. COLTANDMISSISSIPPI chased the pace down the
backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, dropped back passing the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch and retreated.

VEQUIST brushed with the left side of the starting gate after lunging out, responded to some light encouragement right afterwards and assumed a forward
position, sparred for command from the two path, matched up with the ground-saving ESPLANANDE,took over while under a confident ride after the second
split had been posted, edged away, was approximately a body length in the clear leading the competition into the stretch, arrived at the three-sixteenths pole
and got set down, drew off smartly. ESPLANANDE broke on near even terms with GUANA CAY, was the member of that twosome emerging with the
advantage soon afterwards, got guided over to the rail once sufficiently in the clear early on the backstretch, cut the pace, pressed the winner stationed out
in path two, was powerless when that opponent made her move after the half had been rattled off, got cued up for the drive, fell farther and farther back,
saved second. LADY LILLY hustled on the chute, saw the pilot take hold after departing it, kept watch on the first two finishers from the pocket, was
switched over to hard drive spinning into the two path heading home, proved no match. IRISH CONSTITUTION set up path two racing on the backstretch,
was between rivals for a good portion of the trip on the turn, commenced the stretch one path wider, came up empty. GUANA CAY off the inside throughout,
stepped onto the turn from path three, ventured into the fourth one to circle past BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES in the vicinity of the three-eighths pole, re-tucked
into path three after going by, got sent out about five wide entering the stretch, had no response. BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES took up position in midpack,
failed to respond when the rider resorted to a light hand ride at the midway point of the backstretch, continued along unmotivated during the run around the
bend, went into the lane, then after strolling onto the inside route, travelled down the lane having been placed to a protective hold.

COME DANCING chased along the inside, got set down angled three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong drifting in
under an off sided stick near the sixteenth marker forcing BLAMED to pause in behind when seizing command, then was mildly hand ridden to the finish to
prevail on the wire. LADY'S ISLAND established the front from the get go and crossed inside to show the way in hand from the three path through swift
splits, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, floated four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat from a pair, got collared near
the sixteenth pole and fought on to the finish to secure the place honors. BLAMED chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got let out
continuing just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive, got paused near the sixteenth marker as COME DANCING drifted in front, then
weakened in the late stages while clear for the show honors. UNHOLY ALLIANCE four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. PINK SANDS chased three to four wide from the tail of the field, tucked
to the two path half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, made some late ground while
passing tired foes but could not impact the top four. BYE BYE J four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled six wide
into upper stretch and was outrun. PACIFIC GALE three to four wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, came under a
ride midway on the bend, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BATTLE STATION was hustled from the start, established a good position just behind the leader, saved ground on the turn, was asked in the two path into
the stretch, moved out from behind horses inside the three-sixteenths, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed strongly under a right-handed whip to get
the lead into the final sixteenth and proved best under good handling at sizable odds. PULSATE was sent hard from the start, pressed the pace on the
outside, vied in the two path on the turn, took the lead under a drive inside the three-sixteenths, led until the sixteenth-pole, raced between horses at that
point and was overtaken while just able to get the place. READYFORPRIMETIME showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied
along the rail on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage inside the three-sixteenths, battled
on even terms for the lead into the final sixteenth and was outifnished then just missed the place while clear for the show. FIG JELLY settled towards the
rear on the outside, was urged along while three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under a drive, was carried out inside the
three-sixteenths and lacked the needed kick. GIDU (IRE) was rated on the outside under a tight hold, went three wide on the turn, was asked near the
quarter-pole, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and weakened. PAGLIACCI was last to commence, settled at the rear of
the field, went around the turn in the two path, was asked for his best in upper stretch and failed to rally. SHEKKY SHEBAZ dropped off the pace, was taken
under tight restraint near the seven-sixteenths, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path while still in hand, shifted three wide outside the
quarter-pole then was roused four wide into the stretch, was carried out some inside the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. (Rail at 18 Feet)

TATTERAZZI away sharply, established control in short order, made it onto the inside route after completing the trip on the homestretch, showed the way on
a loosely-contested lead, was given her cue at the three-sixteenths pole, dug in to prevail. LEEWAY got set up in the pocket, kept watch on the winner, left
the five-sixteenths marker under a brisk hand ride, got driven two wide into the lane, took aim at the top one the rest of the way home, was staved off.
MAGNETIQUE appeared unsettled taking the two path on the first turn, got moved over to the rail at the three-eighths pole, cut the corner into the lane,
narrowed in to be up for the show. STUY TOWN BABY reserved taking the inside route in midpack, got steered towards the two path for the drive, failed to
cut into the deficit significantly, then lost out on third. POSITIVE SKEW strung out three wide on both turns, went into the stretch, made no impact. WICKED
AMBER parked out four wide on the clubhouse bend, departed the backstretch from path two, got sent out five wide from upper to midlane, mainly
improved. FUN FINDER stumbled at the start, recovered and attained a forward position, prompted the winner from the two path until the quarter pole, gave
way. STORMY DERBY DAY took the inside route, angled three wide in midstretch, never made its presence felt. WILD NORTH underwent a three wide
journey for six furlongs, was slightly wider entering the stretch, folded. SUPER CUTE chased the pace from the two path in midpack, faltered.
