Footnotes
ROMANTIC BLISS was in mid pack, roused on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. GLIB MARYLIN was in
range and raced evenly on the far turn but from the four path through the stretch was outgunned. REBEL LIONESS was in touch, a factor on the far turn and
had the lead from the five path in mid stretch but was all out. BLONDILIKESTODANCE was well back, trailed the field on the far turn and from the seven
path at the top of the stretch rallied late. MUSICAL FLIGHT was off the pace and saved ground on the far turn but needed more.
ANTHECROWDGOESWILD set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left.
HUSH BUFFY forced the early pace and dueled on the far turn but weakened late.

Footnotes
UNYIELDING stalked the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and with a bid at the top of the stretch drew clear. EYES FORWARD set the pace and had
a clear lead on the turn but was no match for the winner. SECRET AFFIRMATION was hustled early and a factor on the turn but from the four path at the
top of the stretch leveled off. LEWNSKYSWILDAFFAIR was in mid pack but bore out into the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch had no
kick. SOFIA'S SLUGGER was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but he five path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. MY MARC ANDRE was well
back and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no impact. HARDY CANDY was off the pace and hustled along on
the turn but failed to fire. COBILOCO was off slow, checked into the turn and had no rally. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON COBILOCO AGAINST
LEWNSKYSWILDAFFAIR FOR INTERFERENCE INTO THE TURN RESULTED IN LEWNSKYSWILDAFFAIR BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED
EIGHTH.

was in touch, saved ground on the far turn and was up for place. ICE CHALLENGE had no speed, moved up on the far turn and from the six path at the top
of the stretch finished well. FOREHEAD FRED tracked the early leader and forced the pace on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
faded late. BLESSED TWO was in range and raced evenly on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. SPINOS was in mid
pack early but trailed the field on the far turn and was outrun. SEAMUS showed speed and set the pace but was headed on the far turn and had nothing left.
