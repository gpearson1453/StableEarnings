Footnotes
ZANESVILLE lunged inward at the start and raced back early on, was off the rail into the lane, drove past the leader near the eighth pole and cleared the
field in the final stages. CHOP CHOP CHARLIE set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, stayed clear near the quarter pole but yielded in the late
stages. MUCHO MACHO BETS chased the pace early, was off the rail into the lane while making a bid but flattened out late in the drive. PEEKACHO raced
back early on, was in the three path into the lane while making a bid but leveled off late in the stretch run. TAKE CHARGE D'ORO tracked the pace early,
was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. SLICK AS A PIN stalked the pace early, was shuffled back along the backstretch,
raced along the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch. WORLD TAX WAR (IRE) was never a threat. MARV'S MAGIC chased the pace early,
was in the four path into the lane and empty down the lane. HAUTE PROSPECT was never involved. PAPPY ON THE ROCKS was through early.
