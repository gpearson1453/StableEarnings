Footnotes
MO DINERO vied for the lead in between rivals throughout the backstretch, entered turn two wide, took command entering the eighth pole and responded
well to urging in the stretch and kicked clear or rivals late. LEEDSLIMIT vied for the lead along the rail in a three pronged duel, maintained rail position
throughout the turn and into the stretch, no match for the winner, but kept on well under urging to be a clear second. IRISH JACK settled off the contested
pace, stayed along the rail through the backstretch and turn, coaxed late in the turn and responded well under urging to rally up for third in between rivals.
ROSAT vied for lead three deep, entered turn three wide and into the stretch in the four path, lacked needed kick to keep up with rivals and edged out of
third late. GUTSY STREAK tracked leaders off the rail on the backstretch, entered turn in the three path and stayed three wide through the turn and into the
stretch, lacked needed rally after the wide trip hand urged late in the lane. MAJESTIC JOURNEY lacked any early speed and quickly lost contact with the
field, rider proceeded to hand ride throughout.
