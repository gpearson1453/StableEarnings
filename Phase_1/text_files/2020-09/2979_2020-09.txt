Footnotes
GOLLY GEE was up close early, was eased back, went three wide into the turn, angled in, was gaining lat and was up in time. JONESEY WHO raced in
mid pack early, went six wide into the turn, took a brief lead, couldn't sustain and finished second best. HUNTER ROCKS was taken back early, went four
wide into the turn and was closing in late stretch. TATANKA TRACKS tracked the early pace, went five wide and was empty late. MCCLASSIC was void of
any early speed, advanced seven wide, angled out and finished belatedly. SONG OF LAURA was unhurried early, advanced eight wide and had no rally.
BACK SEAT HERO set a clear early pace from off the rail and tired. TUCKER D was allowed to settle early from between rivals and faded. TRUST THE
VAN was not far back early, raced along the inside and weakened. HERMANO was outrun early, saved ground and was no factor.
