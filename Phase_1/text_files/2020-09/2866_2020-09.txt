Footnotes
UNCLE GOYLE broke sharply, forced the pace on a narrow advantage between foes, then inside a rival to the turn, edged forward setting the pace on a
clear margin into the lane and held sway through the stretch under firm right handed pressure. TAKE ME UP BRADY, reserved off the second flight along
the inside racing into the turn, split foes in late stages to prevail for the place honors. SAMURAI MIKE tracked off the first flight between rivals in the opening
stages, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued evenly late while gaining a share. CHATTERMAN, a bit outpaced racing to the turn,
saved ground on the bend, then angled out five wide in the closing stages while displaying some late interest. GEAUXCRO prompted the pacesetter along
the inside, then ceded position to track that rival into the turn and faded into upper stretch. ROYAL PRIVACY, in touch with the leaders three deep early,
prompted the pacesetter into the turn and gave way into the lane. SERMON BY THE SEA, off a bit slowly, raced four wide tracking off the first flight into the
turn and soon retreated.

Footnotes
AZUSA ST. broke readily, forced the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, forged clear racing into the turn and held sway on a comfortable margin
under pressure. WALKERS MEMO settled outside foes dropping into last into the turn, angled four wide racing into upper stretch and prevailed for second
late. YESTERYEAR bobbled at the start, switched off the inside tracking the leader in the three path racing into the turn, but couldn't gain striking distance
and faded in late stages while failing to hold a rival for the place honors. WHATDOYATHINK, urged along the inside prompting a rival's pace, gave way
nearing the lane. CHANGING GEARS, off slowly, never gained contention.

Footnotes
TWO BY TWO, rated between foes in early stages, tracked off the second flight to the far turn, angled to the rail entering the lane and narrowly prevailed in
the final stages under firm right handed pressure. MINNESOTA MIRACLE was rated along the inside in the opening stages, switched outside foes racing
into the backstretch, made steady progress to gain terms with the pacesetter midway through the far turn, engaged that rival in a prolonged drive and was
just outkicked by the winner. MINNESOTA LUCKY was urged between foes to gain a narrow advantage racing into the backstretch, moved away to dictate
the pace on a clear margin to the second bend, grudgingly resisted when challenged to late stages but yielded to the top pair nearing the wire.
HAWKWOOD, forwardly placed three wide in early stages, tracked the leaders while shifting out four wide nearing upper stretch but had no late response.
GREAT BLAKE, forwardly placed along the inside prompting the pacesetter to the backstretch, lost ground to that foe and gave way nearing the lane.
ROYALLY HANDSOME tracked off the second flight along the inside and retreated early.

RY'S REVENGE angled to the inside in early stages tracking just off the pacesetter, came through when presented an opening entering upper stretch to
wrest the advantage and just held YOU SAY SO to the end under firm encouragement. The latter was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow
margin racing into the turn, drifted out entering upper stretch carrying out a rival but came under stout pressure to resist the winner to the end. FRONT
OFFICE broke sharply, was urged prompting the pace between foes through the backstretch into the turn, was carried out in upper stretch and weakened
late. BIGDADDY'SFLYINGHI settled well off the leaders to the turn, swung off the inside entering the lane but had no closing bid. FORTNITE DANCE broke
slowly, switched outside rivals early but failed to seriously menace. SHEHE stumbled at the start, made brief pursuit of the leaders three wide racing to the
turn and gave way nearing the lane.

HUSH Y'ALL, unhurried tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, prompted that foe after a half, pressed the issue through the far turn, went
clear while being roused with a few right handed taps and kicked away under mild urging late. BENTLEY'S DREAM was rated along the inside tracking just
off the pacesetter, switched out nearing the lane and edged a rival for the place honors. FROSTY FLIRT, urged to the lead while angling inside racing into
the first turn, dueled for command into the far turn, then to upper stretch and gave way late. FAIRLY HONEST, held up in early stages, switched outside
foes on the backstretch but lacked a rally.

BURGAMEISTER, off a step slowly, recovered quickly to prompt a rival along the rail racing into the first turn, gained a clear advantage racing into the
backstretch, then held sway throughout under firm handling. SPIRIT MISSION broke sharply, stalked just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, lost some
ground to that foe racing into the far turn but continued with interest to close the gap in late stages while always only second best. STITZY, off a bit slowly,
angled to the inside tracking just off the leader into the backstretch, saved ground to the lane but offered no rally. GREAT SKY tracked the leaders outside a
rival from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch and came up empty nearing the lane. Race was hand timed.

PAPA'S ISLA DOLL was hustled between foes in the opening stages to secure a narrow advantage, dictated the pace inside foes racing off the rail into the
turn, then kicked clear racing through the stretch under firm handling. VERY BOISTEROUS, caught in close quarters in early stages, tracked off the first
flight three wide between rivals racing to the turn, angled inwards nearing the lane to bid inside the leader in upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors
while proving no match. LIL B QUICK broke sharply, prompted the pacesetter between rivals racing into the turn and weakened in the drive. DISTINCT
APPROVAL tracked the leaders along the rail, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late response. SASSY SETA tracked just off the first
flight racing five wide into the turn and faded. PASZ THE PEPPER, urged to a forward placing four wide between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the bend,
gave way into the lane. SPELL WINDER, off a bit slowly, settled last to the turn and failed to menace. MUCHO SUPER GIRL, urged to a forward placing
between rivals tracking just inside the pacesetter into the turn, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
CREATIVE ART, reserved off the second flight racing to the turn, advanced five wide racing into the lane and produced a stout rally to edge FAYETTE
WARRIOR nearing the wire under firm handling. The latter was urged to the lead inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, held sway
past midstretch but was collared late. TUCKER TIME hopped at the start, switched off the inside early tracking off the first flight, then continued with interest
between rivals to gain position to the end while prevailing for a share. JACK SNIPE'S broke readily, was reserved last racing to the turn, angled six wide in
upper stretch and made some belated progress. CAMPAIGN SPY angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing into the turn, came through inside the
leader to bid along the rail when presented an opening entering the lane but had no late kick. AWESOME EMMIT stumbled after being bumped soundly at
the start, was quickly righted to prompt the pace three deep racing to the turn and gave way nearing the lane. DROP THE GLOVES broke outwards
bumping AWESOME EMMIT soundly at the start, was collected, then urged between foes pressing the pace into the turn but gave way early.

Footnotes
TIMEINTHETAVERN, urged along the inside disputing the pace into the backstretch, dispatched a rival nearing the far turn, continued to duel inside AND
HE'S LOOSE through the second bend, then edged forward in the closing stages under firm hand urging and some left handed pressure to prove best. The
latter tracked off the first flight three deep racing to the backstretch, advanced in that path after a half to challenge for command outside the winner racing
into the far turn, pressed the issue to upper stretch but proved no match late. SLIM CHANCE broke awkwardly, was settled last, saved ground through the
far turn while coming under pressure to advance and continued well enough to gain a share. RAISIN CANDY BAR tracked off the first flight along the inside
racing to the backstretch, shifted out after a half and faded entering the far turn. BIG NORWEGIAN, urged to gain a position between foes in second flight,
emptied out early. TWISTED MAGIC was urged forcing the pace outside the eventual winner racing to the backstretch and gave way into the far turn.
