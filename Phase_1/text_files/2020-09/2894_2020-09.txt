was hustled along from the outside, raced three wide nearing the eighth pole and was no match for the winner. OH SO JAZZY stalked the early pace, raced
six wide into the upper stretch and had a mild late gain. NOR PER OURS was slow in the early stages, moved up six wide past the eighth pole and had not
enough in the drive. CHANTAJE stalked the pace along the inside and weakened through the stretch. DONYA'S MAGIC was hustled between rivals and
faded. VERBIEN O. P. dropped back early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
WOODHAVEN KID broke awkwardly at the start, moved up along the inside through the stretch and finished well to get up under strong handling. DRINK
MORE BOURBON pressed the pace, raced in the four path in the upper stretch and couldn't hold off the winner late to finish second best. MAGIC WIZARD
stalked the early pace, raced five wide in the lane and kept on willingly to the wire. MY FRIEND CASPER showed good speed along the inside and faded in
the drive while racing five wide. VIRGINIALOVERS failed to sustain a bid. FLASH IS BACK was slow early and never threatened.

stalked the early pace, raced four wide wide through the stretch and finished second best. PAT'S NO FOOL was slow early, raced six wide into the upper
stretch and showed good late interest. BOBBY'S GOLDENGIRL was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside in the lane and weakened. BACI set a
fast pace and gave way. WILLKISSFORKARATS raced towards the inside around the far turn through the stretch and never was a factor. STARS

Footnotes
GAMBIT set all the pace and held gamely to be well clear late under steady handling. KINGSVILLE was allowed to settle early, moved up six deep through
the stretch and got up for the place position in the latter stages. AULD LANGE SYNE was forced six wide around the first turn, settled off the early pace,
moved up four wide at the eighth pole and had not enough in the drive. LE GROS BILL stalked the pace, raced four wide through the stretch and had not
enough. BIG HAMBONE pressed the pace and gave way along the inside. HUNT ME DOWN raced six wide around the first turn, moved up along the inside
around the far turn through the stretch and had no late rally. ROMAN WARRIOR settled off the early pace and failed to respond. UPPER CROWN stalked
the pace, raced three wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. DAY was unhurried early and showed little. CHASING THE CANDY stalked the pace
and tired readily.
