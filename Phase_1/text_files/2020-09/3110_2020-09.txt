Footnotes
UNMACHABLE raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore inside the sixteenth pole and edged away. HARD TO
DENY sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way
grudgingly to that rival late. MUNCEY showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished willingly. TIME
'N TIME AGAIN was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and gave way in the drive. LANSKY raced four-wide through the first
turn, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going three-quarters.

through the second turn and weakened. COOLER THAN YOU was off a step slow, showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn,
angled out into the stretch and did not menace. MOKI DUGWAY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EMERALD SEA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew off with complete
authority. SLEW'S LEGACY stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, could not match strides with the winner in the drive but was clearly second best.
XIMENA'S HONOR lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was up for the show. LIBERTY FLIES broke sharply to duel for the lead while
racing three-wide, opened a clear margin approaching the stretch and gave way through the final furlong. TOUGH ROOSTER lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TAKE YOUR SWINGS was away in good order to dispute the pace from the inside and weakened after
going a half. OSCEOLA CUTIE broke awkwardly, raced far back early and was eased through the lane.

through the lane and held off the gaining ALPINE HYPNOSIS to prevail. ALPINE HYPNOSIS was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, saved ground
through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good late energy. ADJUDGED was bumped at the start then allowed to settle, raced six-wide
through the turn and finished with a steady bid. FALSELY ACCUSED settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. LT.
BULLITT was away in good order to dispute the pace from between foes and weakened after going three furlongs. COASTAL JAZZ vied for the lead from

authority. DOCKTARRI lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place.

the inside and finished evenly in the drive. CREST DRIVE dueled for the lead from the inside for a half and weakened. DRIZZY showed no early speed,
raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the stretch and was not a factor. DEMERARA showed brief speed and weakened.

Footnotes
INTELICRYPT was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths marker and was fully
extended to hold IRISH SWING off in the closing yards. IRISH SWING was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, responded
when set down for the drive and was gaining on the winner late. GENERAL MACH FOUR chased the winner from the inside throughout, could not get by
that rival but finished willingly. EMPIRE RULER lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, steadied late and lost best chance. SEATTLE SMOKE
was off a step slow then allowed to settle, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. IRISH TERRIER lacked early speed, raced
seven-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CATS TOUCH hopped at the start, raced just off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened.
CATS GULCH was void of early foot, raced off the rail through the turn and failed to menace. REGAZZE CAT checked at the start, raced five-wide through
the turn and did not reach contention. DAYTONA BEACH broke sharply to press the pace while racing four-wide for a half and weakened.

Footnotes
FUZZY DOLPHIN broke out to bump rival at the break, opened a clear lead soon after, raced off the rail while setting the pace, remained in control through
mid-stretch and held off the closing VICENTE'S SHADOW by a diminishing margin. VICENTE'S SHADOW was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, saved
ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and was gaining late to just miss. WILSON TO LOCKETT lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the
turn, angled in with a furlong to run and was also gaining late. NORSKI raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a
steady bid. AERO STREET was off a step slow, lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. TUMAC MOUNTAIN chased
the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened in the drive. RENO ROY was bumped at the start, raced four-wide through the turn, angled in with a
furlong to run and was not a factor. BEARCREEK MOUNTAIN was bumped at the start, showed brief speed and weakened. RAISE THE WOOF was
bumped at the break, chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. THE TRAINER OF AERO STREET LODGED AN
OBJECTION AGAINST FUZZY DOLPHIN CONCERING THE BUMPING AT THE BREAK AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE
NO CHANGE.

LEGITMATE CAUSE. LEGITIMATE CAUSE raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished full of run. SO
LUCKY was bumped at the start, dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the stretch and gave way through the final furlong.
MISSED THE BOAT lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. D O'S REIGNOFFIRE lacked early speed, saved ground and
did not menace. CAPITAL EXPENSE hesitated at the start, rushed to vie for the lead and weakened after going a half. FREIBURG was bumped at the
break, lacked early speed, raced between rivals through the back-stretch, moved three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
SASSY EDIE settled off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to take command nearing the quarter, opened a clear lead into the lane and was fully
extended to hold NOUMEA at bay to the wire. NOUMEA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out
nearing the three-sixteenths pole, offered a bid in mid-stretch but could not get by the winner. SALSA VERDE lacked early speed, raced three-wide through
the second turn, could not gain on the top pair in the drive but was up for the show. VERAAJ sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while
setting the pace and weakened after going three-quarters. COLOUR OF MONEY chased the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and
weakened. SHINE ON ME chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going after going five furlongs. STORMY MIST hopped at the
start, lagged far back and was eased through the lane.
