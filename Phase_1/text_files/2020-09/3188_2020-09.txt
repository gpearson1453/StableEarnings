eased out in the lane and was going well at the end. PENDOLINO Broke slow, two path into the turn, three path out of it and made a mild bid. SINGLE
VERSE Broke a step slow, four wide on the turn, angled out and tired. LET'S MAGA Forced the issue early, tracked along the three path into the lane and

five wide on the turn, angled inside and finished with interest. GANONDAGAN In tight between close up at the half mile pole, checked, three path on the

three path around it and failed to take part. HIGHEST RANK Five wide on the turn, was not a factor. SCOTT FROST Broke sluggishly, saved ground and
tired. AFLEET MICKEY Broke a step, three path into the turn and tired. HURRICANE ALPHA Four wide into the turn, five wide out of it and tired. SCHOOL
