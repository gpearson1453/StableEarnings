SHESWILDNFREE broke in front, set a pressured pace into the far turn, shook clear, widened into the stretch when shaken up with a right handed whip,
jumped track nearing the wire nearly unseating her rider and won as much the best. PRADO'S TRUST close inside, began to rally entering the far turn, was
bumped near the five sixteenths pole causing her rider to check then came on again late in the seven path. PRETTY PRODUCTION outside, went evenly.
GENTLE KISS shifted outside to the six path entering the clubhouse turn, loomed boldly three wide after a half, had speed into the stretch then came up
empty. WICKED LOVE pressured the winner two wide into the far turn, bumped with PRADO'S TRUST midway on the second turn then weakened.
