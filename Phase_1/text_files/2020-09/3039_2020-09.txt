HOT CHOICE , three wide between rivals leaving the far turn, moved up a bit wider into the lane, leveled off under left handed rousing leaving the three
sixteenths, overtook the leader in deep stretch and was going away at the wire. ASHARA broke a step slow, rushed up outside rivals and took command
nearing the half mile marker, spurted clear and dropped in leaving the three eighths, set the pace under coaxing into the lane, widened under a drive in mid
stretch then gave way grudgingly. WHISPURRING KITTEN , forward early towards the rail, rated back and stalked around the turn, came back a bit into the
lane, eased out late and kept trying. SING ALONG SUZY , four wide early, advanced three wide outside foes to take aim past the five sixteenths, pursued
past the furlong marker but came up empty. POLISH COOKIE edged up inside near the half mile marker, steadied mid turn, remained inside but lacked a
solid recovery. YOU'RE DOING FINE lost ground four wide and lacked a bid. C TWO had speed three wide, dropped back a bit off the leader leaving the far
turn, chased and faded. LEMON DROP KISS was soundly bumped at the break, dropped off the pace while saving ground and failed to menace. YEYETZI ,
unruly pre race, came in and bumped with a rival at the break, raced wide and failed to menace. HICKORY MADE vied between horses early, steadied back
off the leaders near the half mile pole and gave way. INDEHERE , sluggish from the gate, was outrun.

Footnotes
MOLTO BELLA , patiently handled while saving ground and not too far back, crept closer under some coaxing into the lane, responded when given stronger
encouragement past the three sixteenths, forged through a generous opening along the inside and took command past the furlong grounds, kicked away
and was steadily hand ridden the final seventy yards. S W BRIAR ROSE had speed to lead early, rated back off ANGEL OF WAR nearing the half mile
marker, eased out past the five sixteenths then circled four wide into the lane, moved up to have aim near the eighth pole but could not muster up a
legitimate finish. ANGEL AT WAR broke a step slow, was hustled up soon after and moved clear nearing the half mile marker, set the pace three wide into
the lane, was taken on in mid stretch and faded. LAS SETAS , three wide stalking the pace, was under pressure mid turn, failed to go on and weakened in
the drive.

Footnotes
PRETTY LORI , bumped at the break, recovered and sped to the front, set the pace towards the rail and under some rating, began to open up after given
her cue near the quarter pole, powered away under a solid hand ride in mid stretch then continued to widen while cruising home in the final seventy yards.
CHELSEA WALL drafted back off the early pace and saved ground, commenced a run leaving the three eighths, angled out and worked four wide between
foes into the lane, straightened and leveled off to stride when switching to her corrected lead in mid stretch, kept on willingly and nabbed the place. DEW
DAT , off a beat slow, quickly edged up to contention towards the inside, was urged along stalking the winner, took closer order approaching the stretch,
kept on trying while no match and was edged for place in deep stretch. WHO KNOWS WHAT dwelt at the break spotting the field several lengths, recovered
and settled towards the inside, angled around a rival when picking up some steam past the five sixteenths, entered the lane about four wide, dropped back
down towards the rail leaving mid stretch and finished with interest. LADY CLAU , bumped at the break, stalked the early pace three wide between rivals,
shifted out to race five wide in upper stretch and gave way. SHABANG broke a step slow, rushed up with a good burst and prompted the winner from her
outside, came under pressure past the five sixteenths and faded in the final three sixteenths. GOLDEN MOON SHINE drifted in at the break causing some
bumping, moved up and chased three deep into the turn, remained off the inside around the turn and gave way. BELLA BETTINA , fractious in the gate,
bobbled at the start, dropped well off the pace while three wide and failed to generate a response. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start. No action
was taken.

Footnotes
DIXIE DRAWL bid to the inside of BEACON HILL to take command nearing the three quarter pole, spurted clear and set a rated pace towards the rail,
widened a bit after being set down in upper stretch, kept on under strong handling through the final furlong and prevailed. BEACON HILL led early then
ceded to the winner with about six furlongs remaining, prompted the pace three wide, spun four wide under a drive into the lane, cut back into the margin
past the furlong grounds, continued gamely but just wasn't quite good enough. AIR TOKEN dropped in heading towards the five eighths marker and rated
forwardly, edged up past the three eighths, eased out to have aim soon into the lane, gave hard chase past the furlong grounds and faded. MISS CHLOE G
broke a step slow, chased three wide, dropped back in the drive and drifted in.

Footnotes
GENNIE HIGHWAY stalked the pace under patient handling, eased out to the four path leaving the turn, was fanned out a bit turning for home, took
command in mid stretch and prevailed under steady handling. CAR LADY lacked speed, was behind horses in upper stretch, swung to the seven path in
mid stretch for clear racing room and rallied strongly. MAYAN QUEEN saved ground around the turn, eased out to the two path turning for home, chased
the pace and flattened out. CAIRO QUEEN , a forward factor in the two path for six furlongs, gradually weakened through the stretch. ASPEN ROSE , wide
throughout, failed to rally. SHEZALEMONDROPKID hugged the inner rail around the turn, chased the pace and weakened. MEET MICHELLE chased the
early pace, raced in the three path on the turn and weakened. ARBUTUS chased the early pace, was four deep leaving the backstretch and tired turning for
home. MAJORIE MUGS was no factor. IN CLASS set the pace, drifted out in upper stretch, faltered and was eased. MARYLAND'S MIRACLE was outrun.
