Footnotes
I B CHARLY pressed outside, moved two wide to command early on the turn, drew clear then held under steady urging. TOP HAT TREASON was slow
early, rallied three wide around the turn and closed well. OFFENDER wasn't far back in the three path and gained mildly. OMENED BY broke slowly, lagged
early then made a belated run between horses. URBAN BUCKEYE made the early pace inside the winner then tired. REY ASTRAY wasn't far back early
then tired. TRI TRY COLORS was outrun inside. REDREAMED stopped. FIREINTHEPULPIT reared in the gate and unseated the rider.
