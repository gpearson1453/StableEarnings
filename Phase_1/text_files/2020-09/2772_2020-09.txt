Footnotes
FACTORINTHEHEAT chased the pace outside VILLAMOURA around the turn, overtook that one near the eighth pole then drove clear. RONA , four deep
around the turn, rallied outside horses. WHISPURRING KITTEN lacked speed, swung to the five path turning for home and rallied outside rivals.
POUNDING MUSIC , along the inner rail around the turn, angled to the three path in upper stretch and flattened out between horses. PROMENADE
PRINCESS , three wide chasing the pace to the stretch, weakened. VILLAMOURA , fractious in the starting gate, rushed to the early lead, hugged the inner
rail around the turn and tired the final furlong. ASHARA , steadied soon after the break, was not a factor. TIZ MINE was outrun. RUNFASTBABY trailed.

Footnotes
POLISHED COPPER exchanged a bump with a rival to his inside early on, recovered and stalked a contested pace while racing three deep, shook free of
foes to her inside and took closer order past the three eighths, leveled off when put serious asking past the three sixteenths, poked a head in front with a
furlong to go, spurted clear under left handed rousing then was fully extended to fend off ORTINOLA. ORTINOLA , taken in firmly in hand leaving the chute,
settled off the dueling leaders, angled out mid turn and gathered some steam, circled five wide into the stretch, ranged up outside the winner near the
sixteenth pole, battled gamely but was kept at bay. SIMMARD SHENANIGAN , bumped early, raced between foes past the three quarter pole, dropped back
some mid turn, swung out near the three sixteenths and came back on through the final seventy yards. PRINCESS GEORGIA , ridden along while racing to
the inside of rivals, angled out past the quarter pole, moved up some past mid stretch but lacked the needed finish. WIN THEN GRIN got engaged in a duel
soon after the start, battled two to three wide outside BABY BAM BAM to about mid stretch then faded. BABY BAM BAM , quickly to contention, sparred to
the inside of WIN THEN GRIN, raced in the two path into the lane, stayed on to the furlong grounds then wilted.

upper stretch, dueled and hung. FRED'S SHEILA , briefly steadied in close quarters along the rail mid way on the turn, swung wide in upper stretch and
offered a mild gain. SOCIAL lacked speed, swung wide in upper stretch and passed tired horses. MS MAD DOG chased the pace two wide and weakened
leaving the turn. KENS LADY sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail and faltered approaching the eighth pole.

INSIDE RISK tracked two to three wide, moved up under pressure then bid between rivals approaching the quarter pole, had his rider lose his whip mid twirl
soon after, fought on to the inside of DRAGON MOON as those two emerged in a scrum past the furlong grounds, gained a slim advantage soon past the
sixteenth marker and held firm. DRAGON MOON rated three wide, cruised up four wide and lodged a bid outside rivals nearing the lane, gained a short lead
under pressure in mid stretch, drifted in to race in close proximity of the winner, fought on gamely but wasn't quite good enough. SEA LOVER bobbled at the
break, recovered and sped clear, set the pace towards the inside, was confronted by two foes nearing the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then gave way.
SHELLY ISLAND , bumped at the break, circled into the lane but lacked a solid kick. TIME FLIES BY , off the pace, saved ground leaving the far turn, eased
out but failed to muster up a kick. OHANZEE stalked the inside of the winner, was under coaxing past the three eighths, failed to go on and weakened.
DAPPER MUN broke awkwardly, raced off the pace, saved ground past the quarter pole and lacked a bid.

IN HIM WITH HIM dropped back a bit leaving the backstretch, swung to the four path leaving the turn, gained the lead near the eighth pole, switched leads
twice the final sixteenth of a mile and proved best. EARNED IT , a forward factor in the two path around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, was
hooked by the winner near the eighth pole and weakened in the drive. POSTERITY lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, swung to the five path in upper
stretch and failed to menace. ONCE MORE EH set the pace along the rail and gradually weakened through the stretch. BONDURANT chased the pace
three wide on the turn and faltered. AARDWOLF , a brief four wide factor down the backstretch, faltered and was eased. Due to a malfunction, the fractions
and final time were hand timed.

Footnotes
ALWAYS FORGIVEN dwelt at the break spotting the field a few lengths, was taken wide and pulled his way forward, bid four deep to engage the leaders
after a half mile, moved to a short lead without much asking past the five sixteenths, was roused clear leaving the the quarter pole and steadily widened
under a drive. LUCID DREAM settled off the pace, saved ground into the lane, was maneuvered well out in the track past the three sixteenths, advanced
between runners inside the furlong grounds and finished well to gain the place. ITGOT GRANDMA was sent from the gate and battled to the inside of a trio
leaving the three quarter pole, took over soon after and handled outside pressure, shifted two wide after being headed entering the lane, gave hard chase
past the furlong grounds and stayed on well. CAMPARI lagged off the pace, was under a ride mid turn, angled five wide and had a belated response.
SIDEWALK PROPHET forced the early pace between rivals, prompted the issue outside ITGOT GRANDMA leaving the far turn, saw the leaders get a away
a bit nearing the lane, came back some to give pursuit past the eighth pole then faded late. PRAISE THE MOON , three wide between runners while forcing
the pace, dropped back some mid turn, angled five wide to mount a slight comeback in upper stretch, failed to sustain and gave way in the final furlong.
STOLEN LOVE was rated back from between the leaders leaving the chute, dropped in and stalked, made a mild bid in upper stretch, pursued past the
eighth pole then dropped back. PEP TALKING , four deep with the early pace, remained a presence to a little more than a half mile then faltered.

UHWARRIE SKY chased the pace, circled the turn, drifted out entering the stretch, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
MISS AURAMET , off slow after breaking outward and hitting the gate, corrected and moved up outside to dispute the pace, went clear into the turn,
dropped in to set a rated pace, responded when set down inside the three sixteenths and held firm under a drive. MR. AL'S GAL stumbled at the break,
dropped off the leaders in the opening furlong, moved up some nearing the turn, was under pressure while racing in the clear mid turn, shifted out when
gathering momentum into the lane, straightened and finished with good energy to gain the place. S W BRIAR ROSE had speed to the inside of the winner,
rated back off that one nearing the turn and angled out, chased two to three wide into the lane and continued with effort through the line.
DOCTORSOFMISCHIEF , ridden along, failed to keep pace.
