IMPRESSION GIVEN broke in front, set a pressured pace into the stretch, was headed by the runner up near the furlong marker then fought back gamely
under strong handling to get back up in time. EASY EYES never far back, circled rivals in the four path through the turn, made the lead a furlong out, battled
to the wire but finished second best. FLUGEL BINDER with the second flight three wide, finished with good courage in the four path. LIGHTNING MISS
close up inside, altered course to the six path at the top of the stretch and closed some ground. FRANKIE'S GIFT unhurried early, moved closer along the
inside into the stretch then leveled off. LETSBEGREATAGAIN stalked the pace along the rail and lacked the needed response. SEE YOU AT THE BAR
reared at the start and was no threat. EOWYN'S PARADISE was outrun. YACHT pressured the winner two wide to the top of the stretch then stopped.

the furlong marker and finished well clear for second. GRAZIA WHO away alertly, set the pace for six furlongs then weakened. PERSEVERING HONOR

WILLOUGHBY GAP slipped through along the inside to make the lead after a quarter, set a pressured pace into the stretch and edged clear late under
strong handling. DARK TEMPTRESS was bumped at the start, tracked the pace near the inside, offered a mild bid into the stretch and gamely gained
second. SPICE IT UP bore in at the start bumping DARK TEMPTRESS, lacked racing room from the five eighths pole to the half mile marker, shifted
outside five wide giving up ground then came on again late. LUV LYES dueled for the lead four wide and faded in the stretch. UNWRITTEN trailed into the
stretch, swung wide then passed a tiring few. I'M FEELING LUCKY contested the lead three then two wide into the stretch and weakened in the final
furlong. CHIT CHATTING matched stride for the lead between horses for a half then was used up.

COLORINCOLONEL well placed within striking distance in the four path, responded under right handed urging through the stretch, surged two wide to make
the lead past the sixteenth pole and drew off. THREE ILLUSIONS stalked the pace along the inside, shifted out and rallied two wide to make the lead in
upper stretch, drifted to the four path, drew clear inside the furlong marker then was no match for the winner. PANAMANIAC broke in front, set the pace to
the top of the stretch then weakened. PAINT DAKOTA pressed the pace two then three wide into the stretch then gave way. J P'S GLADYS broke slowly,
moved up near the inside on the far turn then came up empty. LITTLE MATILDA failed to menace. RACINROSEMARY was through early. MISS JUILANA

Footnotes
MERENGUE sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set the balance of the pace, widened into the stretch and won as much the best under mild urging.
MISS LEGS chased the winner and finished clearly second best in the four path. AUNT PEG also chased the winner and faded through the stretch in the six
path. SOMEWHERE UP NORTH had speed into the turn then weakened. WAR CAT was no factor. SAMTASTIK popped the gate doors opened a fraction
of a second early, was hung up for several seconds, galloped around the track while never in contact with her field, was declared a non starter and walked
off. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DECLARED SAMTASTIK A NON STARTER.
