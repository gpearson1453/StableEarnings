HEAT SEEKING LETA stalked the leaders inside to mid turn, shifted off the rail and was two wide into the stretch, eased out for room in upper stretch then
rallied once clear and wore down CLOCHARD STREET late. CLOCHARD STREET hustled to contest the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded when
straightened, led in deep stretch but could not stall the winner. UNUSUAL SECRET trailed to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then shifted out and was
closing determinedly late. LIS LA VICTOIRE attended the pace outside the runnerup, was two wide to the stretch, responded to mid stretch but was
outfinished in the final sixteenth. SLEDDIESKITTEN also was stalking to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch but got outrun to mid stretch and
gave way.

ROYAL CHARM was on the pace off the rail to mid turn, edged away to the stretch then held under steady urging. SIZZLING EVENING stalked the leaders
to the turn, shifted off the rail into the stretch then could not catch the winner but bested the others. IVORIAN chased the leaders to the turn, bid three wide
to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task to the line. RED STAR had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch and was gaining in the
late stages. UNSTOPPABLE GUY attended the pace early then pressed three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. CASH
LIMIT was chasing to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. CAJUN BETTOR was outsprinted early, came
three wide to the stretch but failed to threaten in the drive. POWER TIMES TWO broke awkwardly, took up and did not recover.

BOBBY'S ALIBI never far back, bid three wide to the stretch, rallied to take over in mid stretch and edged clear driving. ROUSING SLAMMER attended the
pace from the rail to the stretch, could not stall the winner in mid stretch but held the place. MR. ARTISTIC was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the
stretch then was no threat to the winner and too late for second. HOMEGROWN hustled to contest the pace outside of ROUSING SLAMMER, came two
wide to the stretch, stayed to mid stretch then tired. GOOD TIME DOLLY trailed to the turn, was two wide to the stretch and picked off rivals without
threatening. WALKING WITH DINO got outsprinted to the turn then saved ground but lacked a closing response. DEALERS HAND was chasing to the turn,
raced off the rail to the stretch then weakened in the final furlong. DI LAURIAN was also outsprinted, tried to rally while three wide on the turn but gave way

Footnotes
HAL'S BUDDY was content to trail to the second turn, swung out five wide while rallying into the stretch, getting the jump on GRATZIE (GB), continued to
respond and got a game nod on the wire. GRATZIE (GB) was unhurried to the second turn, swung out four wide for room, got outkicked by the winner to
mid stretch but dug in determinedly and just missed. REV REE set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then could not stall the top
two. BUTTIE settled mid pack for a half mile, saved ground on the second turn but lacked the needed late response. JUST CLASSY pressed the pace to the
second turn, came two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then weakened. GOING TO SHABOOMS tracked the leader three wide to the stretch
then was also outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CONTINENTAL UNION had no speed and was under some pressure to stay within striking distance to the turn, bid three then four wide to the stretch,
swung out widest for the drive and closed determinedly to be along in time. DARK PROOF also had no speed, raced two then three wide to the stretch,
rallied to collar WHENDUCKSFLY a sixteenth out but could not stall the winner. WHENDUCKSFLY dueled for the lead inside two others while saving
ground to the stretch, edged clear under urging to mid stretch but was caught a sixteenth out and weakened. SHUMWAY got bumped and jostled between
rivals early, took back, chased to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch and lacked a closing response. TERRIBLE TED hustled to contest the pace
three wide to the stretch then was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. CINDERELLAS PRINCE was on the pace between rivals and two wide to the stretch
then was also outrun to mid stretch and tired.

Footnotes
FABRIANA was well placed to the half, rallied three wide to the stretch, pushed clear to mid stretch and held driving. SIMPLY CHARMING set the pace to
the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then was overtaken by the winner but had enough of a cushion to save the place. OH BE ONE chased the
pace to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch then was too late for second. ON THE WINGS OF had no speed, saved
ground on the far turn and was making up ground belatedly. INDIAN HEAD NICKLE pressed the pace from the rail to the stretch then weakened. SUNNY
SPOT settled mid pack to the second turn, was off the rail to the stretch then was caught in traffic in mid stretch, checked and finished evenly. GLENROY
was also allowed to settle to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. JENS DE VILLE had no
speed and was not a factor. CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT also had no speed, circled five wide on the second turn but weakened in the drive.

NO LONGER SILENT had good speed, dueled from the rail to the stretch then edged clear to mid stretch and held driving. PASSIONATE REWARD was
outsprinted early, raced two wide to the stretch then could not impact the winner but held second. EL CHAVO DEL OCHO had no speed, trailed to the turn,
was two wide to the stretch and finished with interest. HONEYMOONZ OVER chased the winner three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response.
DARNQUICK hustled to contest the pace outside a rival, was two wide to the stretch but tired in the drive. TOUCHED BY AUTISM had no speed and was
not a factor. The fractions and final time are being withheld pending further review. Race was hand timed.

LUCKY MS JONES lagged to the half, saved ground on the second turn then found clear sailing inside in the stretch and closed with a stout rally to be along
in time. EARLYNTHEMORN set all the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded when set down for the drive but could not hold off the winner. SHAKE IT

pack to the second turn, was four wide to the stretch, also shifted out and closed determinedly late. CEEYA LATER was chasing to the second turn, raced
three wide to the stretch then finished willingly but was outkicked. STREET SONATA had no speed, settled to the second turn, raced three wide to the
stretch then eased out and was gaining ground steadily. TOOLEY TUNES also chased the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, loomed a
threat in mid stretch but was outfinished. GIFTY stalked the leader for a half mile, offered her best bid two wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid
stretch and tired. BIG MARIA had no speed, was three wide on the second turn then showed some mild interest in the final furlong. TOTALLY NORMAL
