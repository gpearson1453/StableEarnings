INCLUDERE away alertly, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and won under left handed urging. PEGGY'S COVE trailed early, closed fast four wide
through the stretch in the six path and finished clear for second. SHYLA allowed to settle, had a mild late rally inside. YURUBI pressed the early pace,
chased the winner from the inside and failed to respond. FLAT CALM stalked the pace two wide and lacked the needed response. CHASING THE BUCK

MONTAUK COVE pressed the early pace along the rail, made the lead entering the turn, set the balance of the pace and widened at will through the stretch
under a strong hand ride to win as much the best. REBEL ROAD unhurried early, rallied through the stretch in the five path and finished clear for second.
SOUTHERN SPIRIT broke sharply, set the early pace two wide, had speed into the stretch and weakened late. YO BERBS went evenly. OPRAH'S
RANGER failed to menace. PEP THE CHAMP was outrun. SALT MINE settled mid pack then lacked the needed response. NETAS was never involved.

MARKET SUCCESS was in tight shortly after the start, trailed into the clubhouse turn, circled rivals three wide through the far turn and into the stretch,
made the lead before the furlong marker, jumped track forty yards out and won under confident handling. STEPHANIE'S FAITH close up along the inside
from the start, lacked racing room into the far turn, got through at the top of the stretch, loomed boldly inside the winner and held on for second. HIGH FIRE
unhurried early, finished with good courage in the five path just missing second. I RECALL broke in front, set a pressured pace through the far turn then was
outfinished. MISS IRISH BOSS pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then gave way. SHESWILDNFREE was a forward factor in the four and five
paths into the stretch then flattened out.

CAT HEAT away alertly, stalked the pace along the rail, got through to make the lead in deep stretch and drew clear under right handed urging. SEASONS
END allowed to settle, closed three wide through the stretch, drifted out then in and got up for second. ADMIRAL GLEN broke in front, set a the pace off the
rail in the two path until deep stretch then was outfinished. TOM T well placed, went evenly. PINOT ENVY was bumped and squeezed at the start, clipped
heels, advanced four wide on the turn and into the stretch then came up empty. HAPPY TAKEOVER chased the pace from the three path into the stretch
then faded. FAMILY JET bore out at the start causing a chain reaction of bumping to his outside then was through early. CLASSIC VOLUME had speed into
the turn then gave way. SWEET JILL'S JACK was bumped at the start then outrun. THE RIDER OF PINOT ENVY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST
THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER
OF FINISH.
