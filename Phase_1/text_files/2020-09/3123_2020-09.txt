Footnotes
UPTOWN was reserved behind leaders, readily passed foes entering the far turn, led clear by the five sixteenths pole and was whip urged once down the
lane. HIPSTER had a short lead up the backstretch, was roused to keep up after being passed by the winner on the turn, was no match and drifted out in
the stretch while staying second. SHELTOWEE'S BIGCAT raced alongside the leader to the far turn, was pushed along for more, briefly challenged the
second place horse entering the stretch but leveled out after angling inside and settled for show. KISSINGER tracked from inside while up close, stayed
inside on the far turn and faltered there.

NAUGHTY FACTOR bore in sharply start bothering several foes, vied to turn, took over, drove clear in the stretch and held sway. BIONIC ROSIE hustled
along in earnest, went to riding into turn, chased winner. WICKED BETTY no speed to the turn, rallied outside with a late mild run. SPRING FROST no
speed to the turn, finished up well in the final sixteenth. EOWYN unhurried to the turn, closed the gap while no real threat. ORLEANS far back out of the
turn, closed the gap while wide in the str. YES I'S A MILLER inside trip throughout but lost ground in the stretch run. ON THE COME failed to menace.
COMPETITIVE QUEEN rushed outside to the half, gave way readily. MY MAIKO never a factor. LAHIRI off slow, never a factor. TINGSTHATMAKESENSE
brief foot, stopped. A riders inquiry in the stretch run was disallowed by the judges

Footnotes
BONITA ANNIE raced up close, chased the leader on the turn, got past that foe in upper stretch and stayed clear. SHE'S NO DRAMA had a lone lead
nearing the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch to the winner, was no match but stayed on well for place. SHAPE OF YOU stayed off the pace, spurted
forward from between horses past the quarter pole, had some late gain and held off a foe nearing the wire to keep show. DRAMA RUN raced mid pack, was
willing late but ran out of ground for show. SWEET BRYNLIE brushed a foe at the start, improved position on the turn, had the show spot in the stretch but
faltered in the late going. KANTASTIC trailed, was very wide in the stretch and improved position. APPEALING JULIA brushed a foe at the start, lacked
room and steadied sharply on the turn and lost best chance. HOTTIE STILETTO was up close to the turn and swallowed by passing foes.
