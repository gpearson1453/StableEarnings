Footnotes
TOMAHAWK EXPLORER cleared the lead, was engaged by NORTHERN JAGER and TINY TYCOON entering the far turn and held well clear under mild
handling. COMMISSION MAN settled off the pace while four wide through the backstretch, took closer order entering the lane, bid four wide into the drive,
gained late but was never any threat to the winner. SHADY BIZ saved ground inside, chased along the rail into the lane while improving position into the
stretch then flattened out in the late stages. TINY TYCOON stumbled leaving the gate, prompted while three wide leaving the backstretch and faded.
NORTHERN JAGER rated just off the pace in the early stages, pressed the issue into the far turn from the two path and faded.

LUCKY LAST NIGHT settled mid pack while four wide, went in pursuit of the pacesetters in the final turn, swept the lead and held safely. STEELFORCE
settled near the rear, drove three wide into the lane under encouragement and gained late but was no threat to the winner. SOCRATES chased leaving the
backstretch, swung out four wide at the quarter pole and offered a late mild bid. KICKEN WEST G. chased the pacesetters while lugging in throughout the
backstretch, gained closer order then was corrected at the top of the stretch and passed tiring rivals. SMALL TOWN DUDE saved ground inside, lodged
mild rail bid and failed to threaten in the drive. ITS ALL GOOD hustled to set the pace inside, took pressure inside of MOON JUICE leaving the backstretch,
was unable to move on with the fore mentioned and faded gradually. MOON JUICE pestered the early pace, inherited the lead approaching the quarter pole
then wilted abruptly. **MOON JUICE reported by the Official Veterinarian as having bled following the running of the race.

PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE hustled to the front to secure a rail position, contested the pace inside into the backstretch, settled into stride then saved ground
into the far turn, faced no challengers approaching the quarter pole and was kept to pressure never in jeopardy. KENTUCKY ROLL sat in striking range
while saving ground inside, went in pursuit of the leader then angled off the rail at the three sixteenth pole but was no match for the winner. JEANIE DEANS
broke outward the was gap into the backstretch, gained closer order in the final turn and passed tiring rival late. MUSIC AT WORK sat just off the pace while
under a snug hold entering the backstretch, fanned three wide into the far turn, had no response when called upon and gave way. SALSA TANGO saved
ground and failed to menace. INQUISITIVE CAT hounded the pace from the three path and was through early.

STORMCHASER hurried away, sat in striking position while three wide, gained the lead at the head of the stretch and won driving. IRISH GOLD disputed
the pace inside of STRIDERS RING, gained upper hand entering the final turn, responded to challenge from STORMCHASER and gave way grudgingly mid
stretch, finishing best of the rest. BAR NO Q settled early from the two path, lodged a mild bid and held sway. MIDNIGHT SHAKE rated from off the pace
outside, went three wide into the far turn, drove four wide into the lane and rallied mildly through the drive. PACIORETTY hustled outside and lodged a late
mild rally. SMARTY RIVER PANTS chased from the two path and had nothing left late. STRIDERS RING hounded the pace from the two path, was unable
to sustain the bid that was need and tired.

FLORIST disputed the pace while three wide, dueled into the final turn inside of COPPER FOX, edged away at the in the final sixteenth and held. CITY OF
PEARLS steadied leaving the chute, sat in range inside, was roused at the quarter pole, rallied gradually from just off the rail and missed. ANSTRUM never
far back while four wide, circled into the lane then rallied steadily outside and got by late for show honors. LEENA raced at the back of the pack, uncoiled a
late rail bid and was denied late for placing. COPPER FOX attended the pace while four wide, prompted action at the three eighths marker, gained a short
advantage over FLORIST approaching the quarter pole but was unable to sustain the bid that was required and yielded in the stretch. DAZZLING CHIC
contended the pace along the rail, was unable to keep the pace with the field and tired. FAIRY BARB broke awkwardly then cruised up while wide through
the backstretch and tired early.

Footnotes
LIGHT FAST FEET sat in striking distance from the three path, went in pursuit of the leader into the far turn, drifted inward into the lane then gained the lead
at the head of the stretch and won driving. BOUND TO BE SMART broke outward leaving the gate then was sent for speed outside, showed the way
through the backstretch, remained unchallenged through the final turn but seen her margins diminish, dug in when challenged by LIGHT FAST FEET but
could not stall the winner. COUNT ON IT crowded leaving, saved ground while in striking range, chased the leaders into the lane but was unable to gain
ground and held for show. CUVEE TEE raced in second flight while three wide, closed gradually mid stretch and missed. LADY BENGEL chased inside,
lodged a two wide bid then angled inside and rallied mildly late. AWESOME GIGI squeezed out leaving, chased hard along the rail into the far turn and gave
way. IT'S NO HOLIDAY hustled outside then raced wide through the backstretch and was outrun. ABERDEEN ANNIE went six wide through the backstretch
and was done early. **JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of COUNT ON IT against the rider of LIGHT FAST FEET alleging
interference away from the gate. After review of the Stewards the objection was disallowed and no change.

Footnotes
DRAYMAGIC sat mid pack while five wide through the backstretch, angled out approaching the three sixteenth pole, rallied steadily outside and won driving.
IMPOSING CAT raced near the back of the pack, angled towards the rail entering the far turn, lacked running room inside at the top of the stretch and
inched away for place. FACTORED IN lacked early speed, chased wide into the lane then closed outside and was up for show. MADE FOR SATURDAY sat
just off the pace while three to four wide, moved up to a striking position then swung out at the top of the lane and closed gradually but missed. POKER
TABLE sent for speed between rivals, took pressure entering the far turn then dueled three wide outside of WEST OF SABINAL then exchanged brushes
into the stretch and yielded late. MYSTERIOUS PROMISE sat off the pace inside, came under urging into the lane and flattened out in the stretch. WEST
OF SABINAL hustled inside, gained an inside advantage over POKER TABLE into the far turn, matched strides with the fore mentioned while exchanging
brushes under heavy urging and gave way. ZUCCHINI chased outside and was roused to no avail. BIONIC BIRD tracked outside early and tired. PEYTONS
PRINCE attended the early pace while four to five wide and tired with three furlongs remaining.

Footnotes
DANCING WILLIE got away well then crossed inside soon after the start, led the field through the backstretch, responded to looming threat into the stretch
and won going away. BANG ON fractious in gate then was away last, saved ground while trailing, advanced quickly along the rail into the final turn,
improved contention at the head of the stretch but was no match match for the winner. SHOTTHRUTHEHEART chased three to four wide early, fanned four
wide then was put to a drive and rallied late to earn show. SIR MIEZIE rated from just off the pace under a snug hold, moved up closer into striking position
while two wide on the final turn, loomed boldly at the three sixteenth pole but could not muster the rally that was needed and was edged out late. COMMON
KNOWLEDGE tracked four wide in the opening stages and lacked a closing response while five wide through the stretch. WEDGE POND showed early
inside speed away from the gate then sat just off the pace, lost ground leaving the backstretch, came under urging through the stretch and gave way.
CREATIVE LETTERS chased the field through the backstretch and lacked a response when called upon. ARIZONA GRAND under heavy restraint early,
drifted towards the rail then drifted outward under a strong hold and was outrun. OLD DOUBLE DIAMOND saved ground early and was outrun.

Footnotes
PIPER ROSE content to settle at the back of the field, saved ground inside then advanced quickly through the far turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied
steadily outside and was along in time. SAVEITFORARAINYDAY saved ground along the rail while mid pack, moved up closer into striking position leaving
the backstretch, shifted out to the three path at the quarter pole then swept the lead and was bested late. A RING 'N A ROSE away well then angled to the
rail, disputed the pace entering the backstretch, was overtaken at the quarter pole then stayed on evenly under steady handling and held show. EMMA
JEAN TOO trailed the field, angled in entering the final turn and lodged a mild bid. CRAFTY ENGAGEMENT pressured the pace from the two path and left
nothing in reserve for the drive. LITTLE ROSALYN chased the pacesetters through the backstretch and failed to respond. MISS HESI steadied entering the
opening turn and never reached contention. GO MAMA took a bad step in the opening turn, chased the pacesetters from the two path, gained closer order
into the far turn then drifted wide into the lane, was eased through the stretch and walked off.
