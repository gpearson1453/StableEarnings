FAST FAIRY allowed to settle, as put to a right handed whip near mid stretch, closed fast in the five path and got up in the final strides. BRYCE'S ANGEL
broke inward bumping a rival, battled for the lead into the turn, gained the advantage, shook clear in upper stretch, set the balance of the pace then couldn't
handle the late charge of the winner. BAR CAT dueled for the lead into the tun, had speed until mid stretch then faded. LAS ANA failed to menace. FIRST
ANGEL bumped at the start, was well placed then failed to respond. DIDDY DEW also bumped at the start, was no factor.

FOX ON THE RUN stalked the pace into the stretch, dug in three wide to make the lead late and lasted under strong handling. MUY CARO never far back,
closed through deep stretch in the seven path and just missed. UNCLE KEVIN altered course to the outside leaving the chute, rushed to contention then
went evenly. OFF THE MARK made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace until deep stretch then weakened. NANTAN failed to menace.
ARCHIPELAGO prompted the pace three then two wide into the turn, drew on even terms for the lead nearing the quarter pole, dueled into the stretch,
suffered and injury near the sixteenth pole, was eased to the wire and walked off. JAMAICAN MAGIC trailed.
