Footnotes
MUD PIE stalked the loose leader three wide, inched closer into the lane, drew off passing the three sixteenths pole, widened under a vigorous hand ride,
and was geared down through the final sixteenth. MR MATUSCHEK cleared into the first turn, opened up and held a wide margin, but was headed by the
winner at the three sixteenths pole, then held place. ACCESSIBLE was off a bit slowly, raced far off of the pace along the inside, advanced to midpack
around the far turn, then shifted four wide in upper stretch, and stayed on through the late stages to prevail over an inner foe for show. CRIMINAL
DEFENSE saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, two wide around the far turn, and a rallied inside of foes through the final furlong, but missed
show. CIVIL SERVANT was positioned forwardly along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, but was outkicked by the winner in upper stretch, and
tired. PAINTSVILLE raced far off the pace two wide, and chased the leaders home without making a bid. ZAWADI raced far off of the pace three wide and
failed to menace. GHOSTLORE prompted the pace along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch. THE HAPPY GIANT was
caught four wide and failed to factor. SCOTT POND was bumped at the start, trailed, and never got involved. LEMON KICK was done early. CALLMECASH
was caught wide around both turns and never got involved.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY STONE tracked from midpack three wide around the turn, shifted five wide turning for home, drove past inner foes to forge an advantage at the
three sixteenths pole, and widened under driving pressure. POWER END chased the leading duelers from the inside, but was outkicked by the eventual
winner in upper stretch, shifted out and kept on, split tiring foes three wide at the furlong pole, and proved second best. HOMEBRED raced off of the pace
early on, shifted down to the rail into the far turn, put POWER PLAYER in tight quarters in the process, then saved ground and produced a rally inside of
foes through the lane, but leveled off on his left lead. LOST IN LIMBO chased the dueling leaders two wide, produced a four wide rally in upper stretch, but
was outkicked by the winner passing the quarter pole, then flattened out late and got outfinished for minor rewards. HIGH CRIME dueled for the lead inside
of CORRUZE, shifted out in upper stretch to meet bids after that foe tired, but was headed at the three sixteenths pole, and weakend. POWER PLAYER
raced far off of the pace along the inside, steadied when put to tight quarters by HOMEBRED at the half mile pole, and failed to make an impact. CORRUZE
dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened approaching the quarter pole, and stopped through the lane. HURRICANE HIGHWAY was outrun.

foes in upper stretch, but was headed by STRUT THE RING at the sixteenth pole, and was second best. HIGH NOON RIDER tracked from off of the pace
two to three wide and between horses, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and stayed on through the lane while hanging on his left lead. RULER OF THE
NILE stalked along the inside, shifted three wide in upper stretch, but failed to produce a bid while hanging on his left lead. MARV'S MAGIC saved ground
far off of the pace, steadily shifted six wide through midstretch, and sustained a mild grind. DISCOVERED prompted the pace two wide, but tired in the final
furlong. OVERZEALOUS was bumped at the start, saved ground off of the pace, improved inside of foes in upper stretch, but steadied at the furlong pole
