Footnotes
DR PARKER set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then held under steady pressure. DRUNKEN LOVE tracked the
pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, angled out, dueled with BOOM SAUCE, edged ahead of that one and held. BOOM SAUCE well
placed, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, dueled with a rival and was outfinished for the place. CAPTAIN FUN mid
pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and edged up for a share. SQUIRREL vied for the early lead on the
outside, bid outside the leader into the lane and weakened in the drive. WHOOPS allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four
wide into the lane and evened out. CAKE AND EAT IT TO mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and could
not gain. MYHESSEXPRESS was never involved. PRETTY BOISTEROUS was no factor.

settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and closed well for the place. ABBEY'S
SNOW WHITE mid pack, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and evened out. DEVILISH MAGIC rated
back, tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch,angled out for clear racing room and weakened the final
furlong. TURING MACHINE ran evenly for a half and passed a tiring rival in the lane. PETTICOATSNPISTOLS stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside
of that one into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
REAL FANCY tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, got through inside the leader into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was ridden out.
WHISPER SLOW hopped at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, gained a short lead through the turn, then was no match for the winner and held the
place safe. OUR LITTLE JEWEL never far back, looped three wide to position, bid on that path into the lane and edged up for the show. WOLVERETTE
never far back, saved ground through the turn, angled out in the stretch and was outfinished for the show. SPEEDY VANESSA set the pace on the inside,
lost some ground through the turn, then had no rally.

Footnotes
ENGLISH LAUGHTER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin to the lane, then drew off and was kept to the task. PEPPERED mid
pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and closed well for the place. MISSION DRIVEN tracked the pace,
saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch,angled out, then weakened late and held the show. ART OF THE DREAM
allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and missed the show. DOUBLE RAINBOW
allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. AWESOME HALO stalked the pace
on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the lane and weakened in the drive. ECHOES OF
THUNDER ran evenly for three quarters, then had no rally. UNCLE DAVE was no factor.
