Footnotes
BASKET GIRL angled toward mid track to give chase then surged to the lead two deep approaching the quarter pole, drew clear midway on the turn and
widened under steady handling, but was in hand late. THUNDER PUNCH angled in early then straightened away about the three path to set the pace, was
caught nearing the quarter pole, dropped back mid turn and had to settle for second. MIGHTY CROSSING steadied off the inside flank of Thunder Punch
early and angled to the three path to stalk that one, gave chase from the three eighths pole then flattened stride past the eighth pole. TINA'S SONG gave
chase from the three and four paths and finished evenly. BADS LIL LADY gave chase through the backstretch then angled in and rounded the turn just off
the rail, but showed little in the lane. WILD CORK steadied on the chute and dropped well back, was eased widest toward the head of the lane and passed
some rivals. LILBITSOFDRAMA gave chase inside and rounded the turn at the rail then weakened. Following a Stewards inquiry and subsequent claims of
foul against the rider of Thunder Punch, lodged by the riders of Mighty Crossing and Lilbitsofdrama, the Stewards elected to make no change.

Footnotes
IMAGOODCHATTERBUG raced in the four path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole,
circled rivals seven wide on the far turn then closed steadily to get up the final strides. SINGINDOWNTHELANE rated a clear pace inside then came under
pressure past the quarter pole, was steadily encouraged into the lane but was caught in the final strides. TIZ JOHNNIE saved ground off the pace, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and finished well at the outside flank of the runner-up. WHIZ PASS raced well back off the
rail the opening turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn eight wide then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. LIKE ME OR NOT
settled off the pace in the two and three paths then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, though, flattened stride at the rail rounding the far turn.
LADY MADISON settled back in the three and four paths the first turn, showed little response through the backstretch and was jostled six wide nearing the
eighth pole. SCOTTISH DENIS saved ground the opening turn then eased outward into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole
but faded on the far turn. K'S MACHEN EM rated close to the early pace inside and gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, though faded leaving the
far turn. ALPINE MOON rated close in the three path then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path,
drifted toward the head of the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
THAT KENNEY KID rated the pace about the three path down the backstretch, was hand urged from the mid point of the turn, came under a drive into the
lane and drew off. MADY ROSE engaged in close chase through the backstretch then saved ground on the turn and dueled for second. LOCK DOWN TIME
chased the pace inside, steadied apprehensively off the inside flank of Mady Rose in the upper stretch and ceded to that one in the duel for second. JUBA
TRAIN was shut off checking at the start then picked up the chase outside, rounded the turn four wide then flattened stride the final furlong. LONG LEGS
LOUISE gave chase toward the outside, raced in the five path of the turn and finished evenly. VACATION SECRET came away awkwardly then engaged in
close early chase, rounded the turn at the rail then weakened. ARROWWOOD chased the early pace toward the outside, raced in the four path of the turn
and showed little more. SKINNY MOLLY gave chase toward mid track, raced off the rail on the turn and proved no factor. BOUNDTOBEOK was not a
factor. ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY broke outward across the path of Juba Train and was not a factor.

Footnotes
NAVY SWORD raced in the three path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid into the far turn and cruised to the lead in the three path
toward the head of the lane, was driven off through the upper stretch, then taken in hand the final sixteenth. SECRET CASTLE saved ground off the pace
the opening turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and dueled for second mid-stretch. GAB'S LIL LEAGUER
raced well back off the rail then bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and finished evenly. SO RED THE ROSE settled
well off the pace in the three and four paths the opening turn and left the turn outside, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn five wide
and passed rivals down the lane. WINDSOR'S CHAMPION took the lead past the three quarter pole and rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward
the three eighths pole, was caught nearing the top of the stretch and weakened. HATTITUDE showed little response after saving early ground. VINTAGE
GIN stalked the earlier pace two deep then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened approaching the head
of the lane. MARY'S LISTED NEXT rated close to the early pace inside then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole
but weakened toward the head of the lane.

Footnotes
MACKENZIE'S STAR stalked the pace off the rail then bid approaching the three eighths pole, angled inside the drifting runner-up a furlong away and dug
in determinedly to edge that one out through later yards. KIM'S PET took the lead at the three quarter pole and rated the pace inside, was pressured past
the three eighths pole and dueled with the advantage at the rail on the far turn, drifted a bit into the lane but dug in under steady encouragement before
reluctantly ceding later yards. JET SETTIN LADY stalked the pace from the three and four paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole and dueled at a close
disadvantage three wide on the far turn, though, finished well at the outside girth of the runner-up. GOLDEN VALE settled back in the four and five paths the
first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn then dug in leaving the turn and finished evenly to improve her
position. JEAN GREY raced well off the pace outside leaving the first turn, bid from the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the six path
and finished evenly. COURTESY SHUFFLE saved early ground and raced well off the pace leaving the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little more. SHALL WE DANCE was not a factor. KEENEASABEAN showed little
response through the backstretch. SUNFLOWER ROSE stalked the early pace inside then picked up the chase past the three eighths pole and rounded the
far turn at the rail before weakening. CAROLINA BAMBINA was jostled around early and raced well back.

DISTORTED SPLENDOR gave chase and raced at the rail on the turn, eased out entering the stretch and dug in to run down GOOD KARMA the final
strides, the latter of whom, set a pressured pace inside and contested the rail on the turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but gave up the lead
in the final strides. LETTS GO TO DIXIES gave chase and rounded the turn about the three path, then finished well at the outside girth of Good Karma in a

Footnotes
BIRD TRAFFIC stalked the pace inside then challenged at the three eighths pole, dueled to the front three wide approaching the quarter, contested the
edge through the turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on well. IM A TRICKY ONE saved ground racing well off the pace the first turn then
bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, dueled through the stretch to take second inside the sixteenth pole and finished well.
SAINTE THERESE rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced
close four wide on the far turn, then outfinished for second the final sixteenth. GLORIOUS MYSTERY was hustled to the lead and angled to the inside to
rate the pace, came under pressure past the three eighths pole, gave up the lead approaching the quarter but continued at a close disadvantage nearest
the rail on the far turn, though, dropped back mid turn and flattened stride. EARNED THE SHOT raced in the three and four paths the opening turn and was
well off the pace into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole then angled seven wide on the far turn and was closing well through the lane.
MEEMAW'S HEART stalked the pace inside then challenged two deep at the three eighths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage between horses on the turn
but dropped back past the eighth pole and flattened stride. SWEET TWEET left the opening turn toward the outside, showed little response through the
backstretch and rounded the far turn in the four path. CORY'S CUTIE saved some ground into the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths
pole then drifted six wide on the far turn and showed little more. BRASS MAGNOLIA saved ground off the pace, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole
then faded in the four path of the far turn. GIMME KIMMY saved early ground, showed no response through the backstretch then bore out on the far turn.
