Footnotes
R M C HOOK'EM attended the pace outside of LORD VADER, rallied to edge away to mid stretch then held driving. COOLCROSS was outsprinted early,
advanced two wide on the turn, loomed a threat to mid stretch but could not impact the winner while easily besting the others. ST. GEEZY had no speed,
raced three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. LORD VADER hustled to duel for the lead inside the winner, saved ground to the stretch then
was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. UNFLAPPABLE tracked the pace three wide to the stretch then gave way. CHARLIE RED RIVER hesitated,
broke slow and was always outrun.

Footnotes
BABY FRANKIE stalked the leaders to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch but was outkicked by ONE EYED ROBIN, angled out in upper stretch for
room but again had to angle out leaving the furlong grounds then rallied determinedly once clear for the win. ONE EYED ROBIN had no speed, settled to
the half, rallied three wide on the second turn, pushed to the front and edged away to mid stretch but could not withstand the winner's run. MERCY RULE
pressed the pace to the second turn, moved up to engage for the lead two wide to the stretch, dueled then was outkicked by ONE EYED ROBIN to mid
stretch and weakened. TYPHOON HARRY checked into the first turn off heels, had no speed, raced four wide into the second turn then eased down to the
two path into the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. UNSTOPPABLE GUY hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail to the second
turn, was collared into the stretch and gave way in the drive. CATS OUT TONITE was rank in tight nearing the first turn, steadied at the seven eighths,
chased to the half, was four wide on the second turn but tired in the lane.

MAGNIFICENT Q T chased the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then lugged inward sharply in mid stretch but straightened quickly and
rallied to the front. TICK TOCK stalked the pace to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, got on terms in mid stretch then could not stall the winner. RED
DAHLIA had no speed, bid three then four wide to the stretch and finished in a mild rally. WHY THE LONG FACE was chasing to the turn, came two wide to
the stretch, angled out in upper stretch for room but finished evenly late. LA CROIX sped clear early, set the pace two wide to the stretch, was collared in
mid stretch and weakened. CHARMING LASS also chased the leader early, saved ground to the stretch but lacked a closing response. RANDOM
PLEASURE had no speed and was never a threat.

Footnotes
CIMPL MAN was settled to the half, eased off the rail on the second turn and rallied three wide to the stretch then dug in determinedly and nailed MANY
ROSES in the last jump. MANY ROSES set all the pace from the rail to the stretch, edged away to mid stretch then could not hold on. HARVEST A STORM
pressed the leader to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task to the line. FRIDAY'S AT SHADY never far
back to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch and was closing ground belatedly. ANGELO'S PRIDE had no speed, settled to the half, was two wide
then swung out widest for the drive and closed fast late. BOTTLE OF SMOKE also had no speed, made a run four wide on the second turn to loom a threat
into the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. TUNE TO WIN tracked the pace to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch but also did not rally.

Footnotes
DEVIOUS DETECTIVE hustled to duel for the lead from the rail to the stretch, pushed away to mid stretch then was under steady urging to the line. CASH
LIMIT chased the pace early, bid three then four wide to the stretch then shifted out widest and finished willingly for the place. SIZZLING EVENING tracked
the pace to the turn, was two wide then eased out in upper stretch, brushed repeatedly with CASH MONEY in the final furlong and missed second. KNOWN
had no speed, saved ground on the turn then closed willingly inside rivals late. CASH MONEY was outsprinted to the turn, raced two then three wide to the
stretch, eased out in upper stretch then was brushed repeatedly by SIZZLING EVENING in the final furlong and finished evenly. ROYAL CHARM attended
the pace outside the winner to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. HARDY CHISEL stalked the pace to the turn, drifted out to the five path into the
stretch and weakened. ROMAN ROCKET chased the pace from the rail to the stretch then weakened.
