Footnotes
VIOLENT IMPACT came out at the start, waited behind a wall of leaders down the backstretch, swung very wide in the stretch and rallied clear. DEL PO
vied between rivals, was in tight near the top of the stretch then came again for the place. HAPPYASCANB prompted the pace four wide, led narrowly in the
stretch and yielded. FIELD OFFICER trailed early, advanced on the turn then flattened out late. ERIN GO BRAUGH forced the pace inside to mid stretch
and weakened. RICKIE'S MELODY led in the two path for half a mile and gave way. RAILROAD BILL dropped back early inside and was never a factor.
HURACAN lacked speed wide and was always outrun. ODDS ARE lagged far behind, chased inside on the turn and had no response.

Footnotes
PIGGYBANK three and four wide throughout, took the lead entering the stretch and drew away fully extended. AFLEET MELODY saved ground setting the
pace, resisted when challenged but then weakened late. FACTUM LOVE STYLE saved ground to near stretch, moved out three wide and then tired.
PREFONTAINE, between foes while just off pace, was left with the rail and tired. SHILOH LANE, wide and just off the pace, tired. COMMISSIONER DAVE
showed nothing. MARNESIA ONE STEP stalked two wide then stopped.

Footnotes
LOOKIN AT ROSES well placed outside the dueling pacesetters, led at the eighth pole and edged off through the final furlong. CELTIC TREASURE broke
alertly and led inside, was collared in mid stretch and continued gamely. JAMMINWITHBRANDON prompted the pace outside then began weakening on the
final turn. DIXIE DRAWL saved ground close up to the stretch and came up empty. GRIT'N'GRIND lagged far behind inside then showed some late energy.
COLONIST lacked speed inside and failed to rally. KION raced between rivals in the opening half mile then gave way. FLAT OUT FLASHY chased wide
throughout and weakened steadily.

FLATEXCEL set the pace inside, shook loose on the turn and maintained his lead under strong handling. BEAU TRACE broke slowly, split rivals on the turn
and gained place. HERE WEGO was well placed between foes and finished willingly. EL DULZURA stalked two wide, raced between foes on the turn and
faded late. MARCH SCREAMER raced very wide and dropped back. TU EXAGERES didn't break sharply, saved ground, challenged near stretch and gave
way. PROUD AND FURIOUS, very wide, showed nothing. HAIL TO THE KING was between foes chasing the pace and tired. WIDGET FACTORY was four

SNOW FORECAST stumbled at the start, dueled outside then edged away in the stretch under constant urging. CARDI G held a narrow lead inside under
pressure and continued gamely. KARABESSA outrun early, moved closer inside at the quarter pole then faded. LADY MAGICA was urged close up three
wide then began fading on the turn. ROCHELA chased between rivals early and gradually weakened. BLUE SHINE dropped back early, moved inside on
the turn and lacked a rally. AUSSIE MIST raced wide and was never a factor. LA CANDELITA raced wide and began fading on the turn. MRS. CREWS
lunged at the start unseating her rider. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race.

ground just off the pace and made up some ground. VOLODINA was outrun saving ground, swung out very wide and had no kick. ROBIN'S DESTINY was
extremely wide racing into stretch and showed little. PANSY was between rivals early, moved out very wide and faded. IF YOU ONLY KNEW eased off the
rail on the backstretch, chased then gave way. CHEVY TO THE LEVY was very wide while well placed, stopped. SYDNEY TIME broke slow and showed
