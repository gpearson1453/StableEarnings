Footnotes
HEELS UP tracked the top trio off the pace, closed in three wide around the turn, rallied to the front past the eighth pole, challenged by the runner-up in the
closing moments and won the bob. FLASH MAGIC up close early between foes, lost some ground around the bend, angled to the rail with a furlong to go,
rallied inside then drifted out closing in on the wire and lost the bob. PARK AVENUE forwardly placed three deep, bid alongside the leader midway around
the turn, dueled leaving the turn and took control entering the stretch, led to the eighth pole and yielded to the top pair while finishing a clear third. I'M THE
BOSS OF ME set the pace under pressure from the outside, headed around the turn, lost command into the stretch and gave way. DANI MO off slow to
begin, came four wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

HARVEST MOON stalked outside the leader, closed in nearing the far turn, headed rival midway around the bend, led into stretch and held gamely under a
drive to the wire. HARD NOT TO LOVE went four wide into the first turn, raced in range off the inside to the far turn, angled in some and entered the lane
two to three wide, rallied late and earned the place honors. FIGHTING MAD sped to the front, set the pace a bit off the rail, met bid from HARVEST MOON
around the far turn and moved to the rail and fought back from inside, yielded to the winner and was edged for second late. PROUD EMMA stalked from
inside throughout and weakened in the lane.

off the pace, went four wide into the turn then angled in some, put between runners in the stretch and got up for the show. SECRET COURIER chased
outside a rival then three deep or three wide into the stretch and got outfinished for the show. HOWBEIT chased off the inside, took turn four wide and could
not rally. CEM SULTAN tracked the speed from inside, saved ground around the bend, angled out a bit in the drive and flattened. TOBACCO ROAD

C Z ROCKET prompted the pace from outside, went three wide through the turn, headed rival past the eighth pole, battled through the late stages while
drifting out and edged rival. FLAGSTAFF set the pace with company to the outside, led in the two path through the turn, held a short lead through the lane
while drifting out, fought gamely to the wire and narrowly missed. COLLUSION ILLUSION stalked the speed from inside, finished willingly along the fence
but could not threaten the top pair. DESERT LAW in tight and steadied early, tracked two wide then angled out in the lane and flattened. GIANT
EXPECTATIONS off slow to begin, chased four wide through the turn and faded in the lane.

three wide into the stretch and bested the rest. SHYLOCK EDDIE stalked a bit off the rail then saved ground around the turn and weakened in the late
stages. SOFI'S GOLD set the pace inside then moved a bit off the rail at the of the lane and weakened in the drive. CONCISE ADVICE hesitated and off
slow to begin, trailed the field up the backstretch and angled to the rail, saved ground to the lane, came out in the drive and passed tired rivals.

ridden out to the wire. TIZAMAGICIAN hopped and was off slow to begin, sent for the lead and moved to the rail, set the pace from inside, could not offer

pace from outside to the stretch and weakened in the lane. MURALIST knocked into rival leaving the gate, raced off the rail and came four wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. BOLD ENDEAVOR stumbled, broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, stalked a bit off the rail then angled out on the
clubhouse turn, remained off the inside and came four wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. POTANTICO bumped leaving the gate, raced
three deep around the first turn, chased three wide and dropped back on the final turn and was eased in the lane. AZUL COAST settled early off the rail,
dropped back on the final turn, came four wide into the stretch and was also eased. MILE AND A QUARTER FRACTION AND FINAL TIME WERE HAND

Footnotes
VIAZAR went three to four wide around the first turn, closed in four wide on the backstretch, took control in upper stretch, drew clear near the eighth pole
and held well under a drive. DISAPPEARING ACT stalked outside a rival, angled in on the second turn, rallied along the fence and earned the place honors.
WIND AND HOPE stalked from inside then moved out into the two path on the second turn, steered out in the stretch and finished well. MISS ADDIE PRAY
broke out and bumped leaving he gate, raced between foes early then outside a rival, traveled a bit off the rail into the far turn and around that bend, angled
out in the stretch and missed the show. ACOUSTIC SHADOW bumped leaving the gate, tucked inside early then moved off the rail on the backstretch, went
three wide into the lane then angled out and lacked the necessary late punch. BRISTOL BAYOU traveled three wide into the first turn, stayed off the inside
and steadied off heels near the five-eighths, went four wide into the stretch and needed more. NURSE GOODBODY tucked inside on the clubhouse turn,
swung four wide into the stretch then further out in the lane to chase widest and finished with a mild late bid. CONSTANTIA three to four wide wide around
the first turn, moved up outside the top pair on the backstretch, chased three wide through the final turn and went evenly late. VIA ANGELICA pressed the
pace from outside, dueled on the backstretch and took a short lead at the half-mile marker, lost command soon after but continued to duel around the far
turn and into the stretch and gave way. MISS MO' LICIOUS quickly went to the front, set the pace under pressure and moved inside, dueled up the
backstretch losing command at the half-mile point but regained command shortly after, fought with VIA ANGELICA to the stretch and folded in the drive.
