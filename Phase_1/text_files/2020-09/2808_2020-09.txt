Footnotes
FLASH TOWN rated a clear pace inside and showed much the best to win handily. NAKIBEYA broke a step slow and angled out to give early chase,
improved off the rail through the turn, angled four wide into the lane and dug in to take second inside the sixteenth pole. SUPER WILDCAT chased the pace
off the rail, lugged in past the sixteenth pole and flattened stride. GUAPA CHICA chased the pace inside, was shut off checking inside the sixteenth pole and
flattened stride. SUPER MALIBU chased the pace outside and rounded the turn about the six path, lugged in past the eighth pole then weakened.
WATERLOO ROSE saved ground, as did. BRONX PRINCESS gave close early chase then faded while saving some ground on the turn. A stewards inquiry
resulted in the disqualification of Super Wildcat to fourth place for lugging across the path of Guapa Chica past the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
WALKNTHEPLANK settled back saving early ground then eased out with a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, steadily progressed in the three path of
the far turn then dueled the length of the stretch to edge out PAINT IT GREEN, who rounded the opening turn in the three path and settled off the pace into
the backstretch, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and was outfinished through the final sixteenth. QUICK ENERGY
stalked the pace off the rail then moved to the lead passing the five sixteenths pole, drew clear midway on the far turn but was caught inside the sixteenth
pole and flattened stride later yards. TUITION PLAN raced boxed toward the rail the opening turn then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail but was blocked entering the stretch and faded. RUNNING PRAYERS raced in the three path the first turn
and settled off the pace into the backstretch then showed little response. CITY PRINCESS raced clear while angling to the inside to set the pace, came
under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was caught past the five sixteenths then faded at the rail on the far turn. GOIN GANGSTA rounded the
opening turn in the four path and raced just off the pace leaving the turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but weakened on the far turn.

Footnotes
PILOT IN COMMAND set a pressured pace and drifted toward the head of the lane, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn and held on well. JUST
GETS BETTER was reluctant to load then gave close early chase, rounded the turn at the rail but couldn't improve in the lane. PISTOL P pressured the
pace and remained close in the three path of the turn, drifted into the lane and finished evenly. SOCIAL CHIC chased the pace, rounded the turn near the
rail and finished evenly. IN THE GOSPEL gave chase from the outside, rounded the turn about the five path then flattened stride. OFFICER APPEAL gave
chase off the rail and showed little in the lane. ISLAND ROCK was reluctant to load then picked up the chase outside, showed no response to steady urging
in the five path of the turn, returned lame and had to be euthanized on the track. PONTICELLO raced well back. RETURN TO ME raced well back outside.
Allen Can Do It ran loose on the post parade and was a late Stewards scratch.

NICE ADVENTURE pressured the pace through the backstretch and remained close in the three path of the turn, then dug in through the stretch to get up
the final yards. INDIAN FIBER pressured the pace inside, raced at the rail on the turn then dueled to the lead toward the sixteenth pole, but was caught in
the final yards. COUNTRY MAGIC chased the pace inside and raced near the rail on the turn, angled out across the path of Risksrhighpayislow while
looking for racing room mid-stretch and finished well to take third at the wire. RAELYN'S STAR chased the pace off the rail and rounded the turn about the
three path then nipped from third under the wire. RESPECTED gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path then angled to the
seven path leaving the turn, and finished well. IRMA GIRL raced well off the pace through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path, angled
to the six path entering the stretch and finished well. CROSSBOW'S WILDCAT chased the pace outside, raced five wide on the turn then flattened out
inside the eighth pole. MESMERIZINGPEGASUS was hustled clear and angled to the inside to set the pace, rounded the turn at the rail, was caught
nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE was never a factor. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW chased the pace inside and raced near the
rail on the turn, looked to be full of run leaving the eighth pole but was roughed from the heels of Country Magic approaching the sixteenth pole and gave
way. A Stewards inquiry and subsequent claim of foul against the rider of Country Magic, lodged by rider of Risksrhighpayislow, resulted in the
disqualification of the former to last place for causing the incident in mid-stretch.

LOOKIN' SMART settled off the pace inside the opening turn then made a bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved in the four path of the far turn, drifted
into the lane but dug in for the lead mid-stretch and edged clear later yards. NATIVE COURAGE took the lead at the rail into the first turn and rated the
pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced clear on the turn but was caught mid-stretch and gave way. RAGTIME COWBOY JOE
stalked the early pace two deep while between horses, challenged at the five sixteenths pole but dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened stride
the final furlong. TRACE'S BOY dropped off the pace inside then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved at the rail on the far turn, eased out
mid-stretch and finished evenly. NICALOE raced in the five path the first turn and settled close outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the
three eighths pole then weakened on the far turn. BALT'MORE FOREVER was not a factor. RAGING MOON rounded the opening turn in the three path
then saved ground on the far turn. TRINNI ENERGY raced in the four path the first turn and stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the
three eighths pole, faded readily, was eased and returned bleeding from the nose, then walked off.

LONELY DRIFTER angled in to settle off the pace in the three and four paths, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and took a slim lead midway on
the far turn, drifted into the stretch, but dug in to turn back Don't Spin Me mid-stretch, then picked up the later challenge of BOOM BOOM GONE and
determinedly bested that one to the wire, while the latter of whom, settled off the pace inside the opening turn then eased outward into the backstretch, bid
nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the six path, dug in gamely to challenge the winner inside the sixteenth pole but was
outfinished through later yards. I AM I WILL rounded the first turn in the four path and settled off the pace outside entering the backstretch, bid nearing the
three eighths pole and raced in the five path of the far turn, raced close through the upper stretch but flattened stride later yards. KENTUCKY DANCER
saved ground the first turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, though, flattened stride the final sixteenth.
DON'T SPIN ME angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn,
remained close through the upper stretch but weakened the final sixteenth. UNIQUE HUMOR angled in to stalk the pace two deep, gave chase from the
three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. COURTLY KITTY saved ground.

CUBIC SOUND settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage two deep
while between horses on the far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and was handled determinedly to hold off HE'S A GOLD DIGGER who saved ground off
the pace the first turn then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the turn at the rail but was blocked at the heels of Whiskey Humor from the middle of
the turn to nearly mid-stretch, recovered stride toward the sixteenth pole but was outfinished through later yards. CASTLES TRICK saved early ground then
bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, angled to the four path leaving the turn and finished well to take third the final yards.
WHISKEY HUMOR stalked the early pace three wide and took the lead nearing the half mile pole, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole but
was caught mid-stretch and weakened later yards. TRANQUIL BLUE raced with the pace inside through the front stretch and was caught approaching the
half mile pole, gave chase from that point but faded while losing ground on the far turn. RIDING CLOUD NINE hesitated at the break and settled back in the
two and three paths, raced outside into the backstretch then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the six path and showed
little more. PROVIDENCE R V F raced with the early pace off the rail then stalked into the backstretch, though, showed little response. HARD BEING ME
raced in the four path the first turn and left the tour outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and closed quickly to take aim in the four path approaching
the head of the lane, but, appeared to take a bad step and was pulled up before being walked off.

FINAL SAY closed to contention to stalk the pace from the three path, took over at the three eighths pole and raced clear toward the five sixteenths pole,
increased her advantage through the far turn and was steadily handled down the lane. DOCTOR MCCOY tapered in set the early pace but was met at the
nine sixteenths pole and dueled from there, gave chase nearing the three eighths and rounded the far turn in the four path and dug in to recover second in
later yards. SHOWTIME CAT stalked the pace two deep and moved to even terms toward the nine sixteenths pole, had a brief lead past the pole and
continued at even terms from that point, was caught at the three eighths pole then outfinished for second the final sixteenth. CASTLE REVIEW settled back
saving ground then bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, angled to the four path approaching the head of the lane and
showed little more. LET'S GET PHYSICAL showed only mild response after saving ground the first turn. ALL ABOUT TAP settled off the pace inside then
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and weakened. SHORT CAKE'S MAN saved early ground well off the pace,
rounded the far turn about the four path and passed a couple of rivals in the lane. NAUTICAL WARRIOR was not a factor. ANOTHER MOVE saved ground
after steadying early. GHOST MINE rounded the first turn in the three and four paths and showed little response down the backstretch.
