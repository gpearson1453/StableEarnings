TEMPLEMENT sat the position to turn, came three wide past the quarter pole and roused to go well clear through the final furlong in a good effort. CAN'T
TOUCH ME good speed to the turn but could not contain the winner late while clearly best of the rest today. MY DARK SECRET tried best to stay with
leader to the turn but could not go on and settled for show spot. TRICKIZAR broke a bit slow, raced evenly with nothing left for the drive. MORGAN'S DAVID
inside trip while never close. SWEET CARLI flashed brief foot with a steady fade from turn. COUNTRY DREAMIN never a contender.

Footnotes
COMPANYS COMING quickly led clear, was briefly headed at the three sixteenths pole, drew off and held off a fast closing foe nearing the wire. PLATINUM
GALE brushed a foe at the start, was whip urged on the turn, came widest into the stretch and had a fast late run to nearly catch the winner. SHE GOT IT
raced up close, headed the winner at the three sixteenths pole, was rebuffed but ran on to hold show. HONOR BAR raced from well back to the stretch and
made a steady gain near the inside down the lane. STORMY MEMO raced from off the pace, dropped back nearing the turn, gained ground on the rail in
upper stretch but faded late. ROBOTRON was never close and widest on the backstretch. CELESTIAL ORB brushed a foe at the start, tracked up close to
the turn, chased to the stretch and tired.

GOFAR KRISTA off slow, ran up outside to turn, continued on stretch, held sway late. QUEEN CITY KITTY unhurried to turn, wide run in stretch could not
get past winner. TREASURE WILBURNYA off a beat slow, made a widest run past quarter pole for show. CARLY'S FLIGHT good position throughout,
leveled off in the stretch run. MISS TREATED STAR speed to the front dueled early, clear quarter pole but faltered in the final furlong l. KAYLEE'S HOPE off
tardy inside could not keep up no real threat. NANA ROZE never a menace. NUTNBUTAROXSTAR failed to threaten. JOSHEN XPRESS speed with leader
to turn, dropped back with little resistance.
