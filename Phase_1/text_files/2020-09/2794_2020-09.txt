Footnotes
HOLLYWOOD HENRY set the pace from outside a rival early, edged clear two wide on the turn, faced another challenger at the top of the stretch but turned
back that rival and kicked clear, was kept to task late in a swift final time. DIABOLICAL RULER stalked the leading pair inside a rival but off the fence, went
three wide on the turn, made a brief and mild bid at the top of the stretch but proved no match for the winner while second best. SUPER SWISS raced
outside a rival early, went four wide on the turn, captured show honors while no threat to the top pair. MR. MOOCH was urged at the break, pressed inside
the winner, weakened. HENRY ON THE RUN went in the five path on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF HOLLYWOOD set the pace from outside, went in the two path through the turn, drifted out just a bit in mid-stretch but held sway under steady
handling. BRANDISTYLED chased briefly inside then from outside having switched out after the opening furlong, got to just off the flank of the leader while
three wide at the quarter pole but proved no match while second best. ALL STEAMED UP shifted in leaving the backstretch, saved ground inside through
the turn but was unable to threaten. JET LAG bobbled ever so slightly at the start, chased from outside going four wide on the turn and failed to rally.
CORNERSTONE was not a factor racing just off the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
BOBBI BABY RUN was lightly brushed at the break but recovered and was mildly coaxed forward, set the pace from off the rail, extended the margin in the
three path through the turn, was well clear into upper stretch, got weary late but held. W F LA VENADA shifted in, saved ground on the turn, fought to
secure the place while gaining on the winner too late. TEE SHOT DOLLY raced off the leaders outside, went three then two wide on the turn outside a rival
and was outfinished by that one for the place. SHESAFASTCRICKET broke outwardly brushing a foe in the process and was soon taken hold of when in
tight, raced last but one early, began to pick it up four to five wide on the turn and gained mildly. JAZZELLE broke alertly, was outsprinted early, switched
outside the leader about the three-eighths, went four wide on the turn and weakened. PASSION RIDE shifted in about the seven-sixteenths placing HENNO
MOMO in tight quarters soon thereafter, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to rally. HENNO MOMO angled in past the gap to the rail, was in tight
about the three-eighths, saved ground to no avail. RUN FOR RANDY broke a step slowly and inwardly, trailed early, was inside on the turn before swinging
out four deep into the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BUBBA NIGHTLINGER set the pace from outside going two to three wide on the first turn with pressure from an inside rival, edged clear up the backstretch
still from off the inside, went three to four wide on the far turn, was challenged at the top of the lane but dug in to hold that rival at bay. MR. DIGGER stalked
the leaders from off the inside in the three to four path on the first turn, was encouraged along and began to edge closer four to five wide on the far turn,
drew alongside the leader at the furlong marker but couldn't get past while a game second. KEEP ON ZENON ON pressed the early pace from inside, raced
on or off the rail throughout and lacked the needed late kick. MOOSEWOOD settled off the leaders, saved ground on or just off the rail through both turns
getting a bit closer into upper stretch but could not sustain the effort and flattened out. HIT A LICK raced between foes early two to three wide, steadily
weakened. STORM ON was shuffled back after the start, forced four to five wide on the first turn, advanced to race between rivals late up the backstretch,
continued three to four deep on the far turn and failed to rally. CAGE RATTLER raced outside four to five wide and came up empty. DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

HESA PROSPECTOR set the pace from outside a rival, went two wide on the turn, edged more clear into upper stretch and was hard-ridden to just last
from STORMIN FAST, who stalked the leading pair from off the inside, went three deep on the turn, was gaining but too late. FRANCHISE TAGGED
pressed from inside early, saved ground through the turn, came off the rail in mid-stretch and ran evenly in the lane. DADDY WHAT IF veered out and
steadied at the break, went four to five wide outside a foe on the turn and was never a threat. STRYDER settled just off the leaders, saved ground on the
turn but was unable to threaten. C TO JUDGE BEACON dwelt at the start and was not a factor racing off the inside. Following a stewards' inquiry no action
was taken.
