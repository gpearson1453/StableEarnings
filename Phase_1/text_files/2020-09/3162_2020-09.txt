Footnotes
INEDATEQUILA vied with a trio of rivals in the two-path early, edged away around the turn, and drew off through the stretch under a mild drive. MADAME
MOON brushed with FOLEY SQUARE at the start, pressed the pace widest of a foursome up the backstretch, could not stay with the winner after six
furlongs, and was clearly second best. FOLEY SQUARE brushed with MADAME MOON at the start, raced off the leaders three then four wide, and was
along to be a distant third while drifting out. TERRIBLE TARA vied inside three opponents for a half-mile, and gave way on the turn. SCAMPER ALONG
delayed the start three minutes very difficult to load, contested the pace between horses three wide, and dropped out of it near the five-sixteenths pole.
MIRANDA SOFIA broke out, stayed close for a half-mile, and faded inside. EMILIA STRONG dropped back early. JEANIE VEE dropped back early.
WELLINGTONS ROSE dropped far back before reaching the stretch, and jogged in. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
GRACE'S DRAMA was under a drive by midway on the turn, advanced to contention three wide after six furlongs, collared PAYNTER FEST from outside in
mid stretch, edged away drifting out on her left lead and barely held on. PAYNTER FEST pressed FLASHING DIAMOND from outside, took over and pulled
clear approaching the quarter-pole, got overtaken leaving the furlong grounds, drifted out and battled back stubbornly. NOWITNA RIVER raced four wide
around the turn, and was along for the show without threatening. BABIE MONSTER was forwardly placed early, and tired around the turn. FLASHING
DIAMOND was bumped by LEDECKY at the start, set the pace inside, relinquished the lead late on the turn, and tired. BROOKES ALL MINE broke out
bumping LEDECKY into FLASHING DIAMOND, and was finished early. LEDECKY got bumped into FLASHING DIAMOND by BROOKES ALL MINE at the
start, and was far back throughout. TROPICALITY was through after a half-mile.

Footnotes
UNO BABY BIRD briefly vied outside SHORTLISTER before clearing to the lead, moved in around the turn, and drew off hand urged through the stretch.
RICKY RUN bumped lightly with TRINNI DANCER at the start, lodged a mild three-wide bid late on the turn, was no match for the top one into the lane, and
ran on best of the others on his left lead. SHORTLISTER disputed the early pace inside UNO BABY BIRD, could not stay with that one into the turn, and ran
on to salvage the show. APPIAN WAY raced without a whip, moved off the rail near the eighth-pole and lacked a response. TRINNI DANCER bumped
lightly with RICKY RUN at the start, came four wide off the turn, and made no headway. SILVER CONNECTION stayed in range early between horses, and
tired nearing the stretch. MAQUIAVELO was outrun inside.

Footnotes
VUYELWA pressed the early pace outside SLEWYS CHOSEN ONE and AUBURN, took over after six furlongs, drifted out under heavy left-hand pressure
coming to the sixteenth-pole, switched to her correct lead with 70 yards to go, and held off FAST FRACTIONS to the finish. FAST FRACTION sat off the
leading trio early, loomed as the only threat outside VUYELWA turning for home, and could not get by while clearly second best. AUBURN pressed the early
pace between horses, and yielded late on the turn. BABY ALIDETT raced four wide, and lacked the needed response. KAUFY FUTURES saved ground on
the turn, moved out in the stretch, and tired. SLEWYS CHOSEN ONE set the early pace hounded from outside by two rivals, and gave way after five
furlongs. OURHANDSOMEGAL dropped far back after six furlongs, and was eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
DISTINCTLY BLUE tracked three wide early, ranged up to challenge outside J'S INDIAN CHARM a quarter-mile out, dueled through the lane and proved
best after switching leads late. J'S INDIAN CHARM pressed FIBER OPTIC from outside, took over near the quarter-pole in the four-path, battled inside
DISTINCTLY BLUE through a long drive, and yielded grudgingly. ROSYJERSEY was outrun to the stretch in the three-path, and rallied mildly between
horses to get the show. SALSA RITA raced three wide on the turn, and lacked the needed bid. PROSPECTIVE DIVA was outrun to the stretch four wide,
and improved position without threatening. SPEED STAR was no menace inside. DIXIE PRINCESS faded inside after three furlongs. FIBER OPTIC set the
early pace inside, yielded to J'S INDIAN CHARM late on the turn, and tired in the stretch.

lead. ROAD TO PEACE moved off the inside around the turn, and posed no threat. THREE DEEP was outrun inside. PALIMPSEST was never prominent.

Footnotes
GAME BOY BENNY advanced around the turn four wide, wrested command from outside at the top of the stretch, and bested HERO TIGER through a long
drive. HERO TIGER settled in the two-path for three furlongs, cut the corner with a rail bid into the lane, and fought gamely to the finish. SILVER DEFENSE
was outrun early, came five wide for the drive, and finished willingly outside. DAD'S YANKEES dueled outside FORT KING for three-eighths of a mile, and
faded in the stretch. DARK AGES was outrun to the lane, and gained mildly on the far outside. FORT KING was sent hard for the lead in the two-path,
dueled inside DAD'S YANKEES, and had nothing left in the stretch. I'M CARDINAL was finished early inside.

Footnotes
CHEZ PAREE saved ground coming under a ride midway on the turn, angled to the four-path rallying into the stretch, came out under heavy left-hand
pressure brushing WITCH HUNTER through the furlong grounds, and drove clear. PANAREA pressed CLASSY BEAST from outside, took over with the
rider glancing back past the quarter-pole, yielded inside the winner into the last furlong, and saved the place. WITCH HUNTER bobbled at the start, stayed
in range early three wide, entered the stretch in the five-path, got brushed and nudged out by CHEZ PAREE with a furlong remaining, and missed the place
out past the middle of the track. LAVI was outrun for a half-mile three to four wide, got taken to the rail in upper stretch and lacked a solid response.
CLASSY BEAST set a pressured pace inside for a half-mile, lost the lead to PANAREA approaching the stretch, and weakened through the furlong grounds.
BIBIANA brushed the right side of the gate at the start, and was outrun. GREY JAZMINE dropped far back outside after a half. MARAMA showed brief
speed, dropped back on the turn, and was eased up in the stretch. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE TRAINER OF WITCH HUNTER FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
MO OF THE WEST settled in striking range three wide, was roused midway on the far turn to go after CENTSLESS DRAMA, reached the front from outside
past the eighth-pole, and edged away under a drive. CENTSLESS DRAMA rated along clear inside through the middle stages, dug in as MO OF THE
WEST challenged turning for home, could not hold that rival off, and held for second. INDICIA saved ground near the back for six furlongs, came through
rallying between horses in mid stretch, and finished well. STARSHIP MALLOMAR was no threat through a three-wide trip. DYNATOWN saved ground early,
had the two-path on the far turn, and made no headway. AERODYNAMIC prompted the pace outside CENTSLESS DRAMA to the far turn, and gave way.
ROSA STAR became unsettled as the gates opened and broke two lengths behind the next-to-last horse, and showed little.

Footnotes
YODEL E. A. WHO advanced in the three-path under a ride late on the turn, took over outside TRAVY BOY in upper stretch despite attempting to lug in,
came out under left-hand pressure brushing FROSTED GRACE lightly in deep stretch, and held on gamely. FROSTED GRACE bobbled slightly at the start,
rallied past rivals four wide after a half-mile, bid outside YODEL E. A. WHO staying on his left lead past the furlong marker, got brushed lightly by that rival
and could not get by. TRAVY BOY broke to the lead, showed the way slightly off the rail for a half-mile, and yielded inside the winner after straightening
away for the drive. ROYAL SQUEEZE was outrun toward the inside early, moved to the far outside coming off the turn, and had no rally. FIELD TRIP raced
forwardly inside to the stretch, and faded. RUNNING FOR RIZ brushed the left side of the gate coming out a beat slow, went up to press TRAVY BOY from
outside leaving the half-mile marker, and faltered turning for home.

Footnotes
REMARKABLE SOUL had an alert beginning despite breaking outward, moved inside nursed along through an easy pace, spurted away from VITAEMI
after six furlongs, drifted out through the stretch and remained clear. LOVELY LUVY saved ground at the back under a firm hold to the far turn, swung to the
far outside past the quarter-pole, and finished well. BIENVILLE STREET steadied slightly in a crowd midway on the first turn, remained covered up under a
hold through the middle stages, rallied toward the inside turning for home, and was outkicked for second. MAKEME DREAM stayed in range to the far turn,
came off the rail to loom a threat after six furlongs, but flattened out through the drive. GREAT SISTER DIANE settled in the two-path early, shifted out three
then four wide around the far turn, and faded through the furlong grounds. VITAEMI prompted the pace outside REMARKABLE SOUL, got shaken off
approaching the stretch, and dropped back. ALIZEE lacked room between BIENVILLE STREET and VITAEMI and steadied back at the start, moved up
three wide into the first turn, stayed in that path in range to near the quarter-pole, and was empty into the lane.

Footnotes
WHYCANTTHISBELOVE broke out brushing ROYAL JEWEL, stayed close toward the inside to the stretch, moved off the rail past the eighth-pole, and
wore down BELLA BIONDA from outside late. BELLA BIONDA broke out bumping MORE DIAMONDS, sped to the front inside, shook away around the
turn, remained well clear to deep stretch, could not hold off the winner and barely held for second. MORE DIAMONDS was bumped by BELLA BIONDA at
the start, lost ground into the turn along the rail, stayed inside for the drive and closed strongly too late. DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB saved ground early,
moved off the inside after three furlongs, gained mildly and did not have enough. DINNER AT FIVE broke outward, raced well back four wide to the stretch,
and improved position without threatening. R SEA SMOKE saved ground throughout, and made up some ground without threatening. ROYAL JEWEL got
brushed by WHYCANTTHISBELOVE at the start, chased the pacesetter from outside to the head of the stretch, and weakened. LEMONCITA was always
outrun. GRAN DIAMOND was never prominent. TWO CENTS WORTH broke outward, raced three wide, and tired through the lane. KATNISS KAN broke in
a tangle behind the field, and never made contact with the field.
