Footnotes
CRIME SPREE up close early from the outside, dueled through the turn, remained engaged with MEAN CANNON through the drive and outnodded that one
late. MEAN CANNON well placed from the outside, dueled through the turn, remained engaged with the winner through the drive but was outnodded.
SARAH'S VISION dueled from between foes early, remained engaged through the turn, held a forward position for the drive but could only hold the show.
AWE SHACKLE stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded but could not keep pace. OH SNAP chased the
early pace outside but could only improve position. LIT A SHUCK dueled from the outside early, remained engaged through the turn then tired in the drive.
IM COMING OVER could only pass tired ones. MAKATI PHIL was no factor. VISIONS OF GOLD was no threat. NO CUSSING broke awkward and was no
factor. LANG'S FIR DOLL dueled from the inside and gave way. SKY WATCH had a steady fade.

DONTBEFOOLISH stalked the early pace from the inside, altered outside up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn,
responded when sat down for the drive and was just in time. SINGING ACES pressed the early pace from the inside, crept closer entering the second turn,
responded to duel through the drive but was outfinished. THAT'S D 'CAT broke sharp from the inside, gained the early margin, remained clear up the
backstretch, dueled through the second turn, remained engaged for the drive but could not keep pace. ROARING STAR FIRE unhurried early from the
outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, responded entering the drive and had a late rally. HANSEN'S HOLIDAY forced the early pace outside but
had nothing left. WEKNEWUWERETROUBLE could only improve position. DE BIRD IS DA WORD was no real factor. MEDITATE forced the early pace
outside then faded in the drive. SMITHWICK was never close. NAUGHTY MOON was no menace. MOSTA FLYIN had little interest. DICKINSON'S IMAGE
up close early, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
SWINGING GALAXY chased the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, altered outside for the drive, responded to duel through the
drive and was just up late. BOURBON REVENGE dueled from the inside early, battled through the turn, remained engaged for the drive but was outfinished.
SOUTHERN LIGHT stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded and rallied late for the show. CAPONE'S LOFT
chased the early pace from the inside, advanced through the turn, responded but was too late. RAY'S KIMUA could only improve position. BLUE RIDGE
SPICE dueled from the outside and tired. MOONLIGHT WILLY was no factor. LIGHTNING HARBOUR was no threat. SWEET CHATAIN forced the early
pace inside and tired. DAPPER DAN MAN was no menace. BRAIZEN FIRE was never close. COCO AMOD showed little.
