Footnotes
RUN LAUGHING stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to gain a clear lead through the turn, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. BABY
DRAGON allowed to settle, looped up four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and closed well for the place. PEMAQUID DOT well placed
and between rivals, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled in and closed well for the show. GENUWINE mid
pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and edged up for a share. LET'S TWIRL allowed to settle, looped up three
wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled in and flattened out. BLACK PATENT SHOES well placed, gained position three wide through
the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong. MARRIAGE allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, bid four
wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. BLAZE OF JOY allowed to settle, looped up four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, drifted in
and improved position. CHINA DISH lunged at the start, looped to position three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and had no rally.
R CHERRY tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, steady hard mid way of the turn and faded. VEIL DANCE set the early pace on the inside,
stayed on when challenged through the turn, then faded in the stretch.
