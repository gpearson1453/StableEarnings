Footnotes
DUGOUT broke through the gate though was walked back to reload by an assistant starter who never lost hold of him, was placed on the lead, cut inside in
the opening half-furlong, set a pressured pace inside of BOA NOVA and NUCLEAR OPTION while racing keenly, took over into the lane, and held between
horses. HIDE THE DEMON tracked the leading trio down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, saved ground into the lane, rallied up the inside
down the lane, and missed. ROYAL COMMISH chased two wide toward the rear, came into the lane in the three path, rallied three wide, and missed. BOA
NOVA (IRE) was herded in during the opening half-furlong when DUGOUT cut inside, switched outside that foe and pressed him while racing between
horses, proved no match past the quarter pole, and ran evenly in the final furlong. DAZZLING TRUTHS soon trailed, took closer order in the five path on the
turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, and made a belated rally near the center of the track. NUCLEAR OPTION pressed the pace three wide, began to lose
ground from the five sixteenths, and faded in the lane. RUNFORTHEMUNNINGS broke slowly, came awkwardly into stride, was pushed along to chase
inside of ROYAL COMMISH, began to weaken near the five sixteenths, and had no response under a drive in the lane.

Footnotes
NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) broke quickly and led the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, pulled clear entering the stretch and was kept
to the task to while extending his lead to the wire. NORTH ELKHORN chased the leader on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn,
began a bid approaching the quarter pole, and dug in gamely in late stretch to hold second. GORGEOUS GEORGE chased the frontrunner between horses
in the opening stages, moved up to press the pace near the three eighths pole, entered the stretch from the two path and finished evenly. EASTER MUSIC
tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground late on the outside in the stretch. LONG
STATION raced off the pace on the outside early, came around the turn in the three path and gained ground mildly in the final furlong. WELOVECANDY
raced outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole, swung wide into the stretch and weakened in
the final furlong. DANCIN NICKY raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. YOU'RE KILLIN ME trailed the field
the entire way around the oval, raced in the two path around the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TOUGH STUFF bobbled out of the gate and came inward in the opening strides, sent to the lead inside, dueled inside of I'M CORFU down the backstretch,
set a pressured pace around the turn while that foe attended outside, opened up when asked into the stretch and held safe under a drive. TAKAFUMI (BRZ)
settled toward the rear early, took closer order while saving ground through the turn, sustained an inside rally under a drive in the lane and got up for place.
IMPRESSED tracked three wide down the backstretch, perched three wide behind the leading pair on the turn, was driven three wide in upper stretch,
chased TOUGH STUFF down the lane while proving no match, and lost the place late. PRESIDENT ELECT settled at the rear, took closer order in the three
to four path on the turn, was taken six wide to upper stretch, and offered a belated outside rally. SHAKES CREEK chased between horses, came three wide
into the lane, and ran evenly in the lane. CAN'T HIDE FROM ME settled toward the rear, was pushed along three wide on the turn and improved position,
was urged four wide into the stretch, and was outfinished five wide. MEXICO MEMORIES settled in second last, saved ground through the turn, came into
the lane at the inside of the rear flight, and offered no bid. ONE WAY HOME tracked well behind the leading pair early, chased the leading trio in the two
path on the turn, came into the lane under a drive between horses, and proved empty. I'M CORFU disputed the pace outside of TOUGH STUFF early,
pressed outside that foe around the turn, could not match him into the lane and faded three wide.

Footnotes
MCHENRY trailed the field from the two path through the opening half mile, continued to bide his time at the back of the pack up the backstretch, began to
move up on the field from the trail around the far turn, and made a late surge between horses in the final sixteenth of a mile to pull clear for the win. GOLD
HAWK stalked the leader from the two path around the first turn and the first time down the stretch, raced in the three path around the clubhouse turn,
continued up the backstretch between horses, launched a bid from the three path nearing the quarter pole, took the lead on the outside with a furlong to go
and was caught in the final strides by the late surging winner. HIGH ON SUGAR raced off the pace while saving ground through the entire opening mile,
swung wide entering the stretch for the second time and gained ground quickly on the outside in the final furlong. THE SHEIK OF ARABY raced in the two
path around the first turn, came down the stretch the first time by in the middle of the pack, continued around the clubhouse turn in the three path, raced
inside up the backstretch, began to improve position from the two path around the far turn and in upper stretch and was outkicked late. GIACALLURE saved
ground from the back of the pack through the opening half mile, angled out to race on the outside up the backstretch, began to move up from the three path
around the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch. RIVER EVANGELIST was rank while saving ground in the early going, continued to fight his rider
slightly the first time down the stretch, ran into traffic and was steadied entering the clubhouse turn, continued up the backstretch on the inside, angled out to
the two path on the far turn, moved up to challenge between horses passing the three eighths pole, took the lead briefly entering the stretch and weakened
while drifting out mildly in the final furlong. KALININGRAD raced in the two path near the pace around the first turn and the first time by the stands,
continued around the clubhouse turn and up the backstretch on the outside, began to drop back from the three path around the far turn and continued to
fade in the stretch. CROCE D'ORO led the field from the rail through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the clubhouse turn, continued to
show the way under a hold up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and tired entering the stretch.

Footnotes
TORNADO BOY chased midfield, was pushed along for a bid into the second turn, responded with a smooth two to three wide bid, swept past the leading
pair near the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, and held driving. MILBURN settled toward the rear of midpack, began to improve two wide past the
half mile mark, advanced three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, sustained his rally and proved a clear second best. DARK WOOD (IRE)
settled third last, took closer order in the two to three path inside horses through the far turn, offered a belated three wide rally through horses in the lane,
and got up for show late. LOVE THAT WARRIOR chased midpack, bid two wide into the far turn, was urged three wide into the lane, proved no match for
the leading pair into the final furlong, and lost the show late. BOURBON TAN tracked the leader, raced keenly in second down the backstretch, encroached
outside the pacesetter into the far turn, headed him past the five sixteenths but could not keep pace with TORNADO BOY as he swept past three wide, and
flattened out in the lane. LAST SPRING tracked the leading pair early, was swarmed by the closers near the quarter pole while still in range of the leaders,
and lacked the needed kick in the lane. ENHANCED EDITION settled in second last, took closer order in the three path on the far turn, went to a drive three
wide in upper stretch, but did not have enough late. COUP DE VILLE was reluctant to load, settled at the rear, took closer order around the far turn while
racing in the four path in the rear flight, came three wide into the lane, and offered no rally. CRANKSHAFT cleared to the early lead, was confronted by
BOURBON TAN into the far turn, was headed past the five sixteenths, quickly emptied out, and was not persevered with in the lane.

Footnotes
MIRACLE MOUNTAIN chased inside of STANDFORTHEANTHEM, took closer order into the backstretch along the inside, pulled behind the leaders near
half a mile out, split between CALL THE COLONEL and the weakening CHARLIE IRISH with five sixteenths of a mile to go, opened up past the quarter and
ran on well clear. BEHIND ENEMY LINES settled at the rear through the first turn, came three wide into the backstretch with the rear flight, rallied three wide
around the far turn, sustained his run through horses with a quarter mile to go, turned for home inside of the weakening CALL THE COLONEL, cleared the
rest of the field, could not cut into the winner's advantage down the lane but chased on a clear second best. FORGOT TO FORGET chased midpack inside
of TIMINGISEVERYTHING through the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch, rallied two to three wide between horses around the far turn, came three
wide into the lane, improved mildly down the lane but proved no match for the top two. CHRISTIAN C chased well behind the leading pair early, took closer
order from near a half mile out, bid three wide into the far turn, headed CALL THE COLONEL with five sixteenths of a mile remaining, led briefly, proved no
match for MIRACLE MOUNTAIN from a quarter mile out, came two wide into the lane, weakened but held for a minor share. TOCCETIVE JAC settled near
the rear two wide through the first turn, settled back to trail the field for the backstretch run, took closer order while saving ground through the far turn, turned
for home under a drive two wide to get around the fading CHARLIE IRISH, and chased on mildly inside. SATURDAYS HANGOVER settled near the rear
inside of TOCCETIVE JAC, was urged between horses on the far turn, swung out into the lane and kept on mildly four wide past tiring horses. CALL THE
COLONEL tracked the pacesetter through the first turn, encroached to his outside with five eighths of a mile remaining, continued to pressure him into the
far turn, led with seven sixteenths of a mile remaining, was headed by CHRISTIAN C with five sixteenths of a mile remaining, and weakened.
TIMINGISEVERYTHING chased midfield outside of FORGOT TO FORGET, took closer order and kept on four wide through the far turn, raced four wide
into the lane and weakened. STANDFORTHEANTHEM chased two wide early, was outpaced from the half mile mark, had no response when asked three
wide on the far turn, and was no factor in the drive. CHARLIE IRISH got through to the lead into the first turn, set the pace while pressured by CALL THE
COLONEL down the backstretch and into the far turn, was headed with seven sixteenths of a mile remaining, and came up empty in the final three eighths.

Footnotes
HUEY ATTACK raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground around the far
turn, began a bid nearing the quarter pole, angled out to find room, gained ground on the outside in the stretch and pulled clear while drifting out slightly in
the final furlong. HIGH SPIRITS hopped up leaving the break, saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and improved position between horses in late stretch. AGAVE KID raced in the two path around
the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to duel for the lead from the two path around the far turn and into the stretch,
and gave way in the final strides. MIDNIGHT LEWIS was bumped and then pinched back leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch off the pace, began a wide bid from the four path near the quarter pole and improved position in the stretch.
CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN tracked the frontrunners from the three path through the opening half mile, raced in the three path around the far turn and finished
evenly. PHARAOH'S KITTEN saved ground while leading the field around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled for the lead on the inside around the
far turn and into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. OFF TO THE BEACH bumped soundly with the horse to his outside leaving the gate,
navigated the first turn from the two path, raced on the inside up the backstretch, began to move up on the rail around the far turn and flattened out in the
stretch. FOGGY ALBION brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch
between horses off the pace, came around the far turn in the two path and faded in the stretch. FAST ONE raced in the five path around the first turn,
steadied slightly coming off the turn, raced outside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and made no bid.
CAPTAIN CARNEGIE veered out leaving the gate, chased the leader between horses from the three path through the opening half mile, raced in the two
path around the far turn and tired in the final furlong. THAI ONE ON was blocked badly leaving the gate, trailed the field while saving ground the entire way
around the oval and was never a factor. SKEETERSKEETS bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the four path around the
clubhouse turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began to drop back from the four path around the far turn and was
done early.
