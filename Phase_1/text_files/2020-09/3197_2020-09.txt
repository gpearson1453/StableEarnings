THUNDER DAY stalked the pace four wide, bid three wide into the far turn, seized command nearing the quarter pole and drew off under a drive.
GALLINIPPER was detained in the starting gate and away well behind the field, rushed up two wide to reach contention early on the backstretch, dropped
back some inside around the far turn, angled three wide in upper stretch and was gaining late. DOODLE TIME prompted the pace three wide around the
first turn, took the lead early on the backstretch, led to the quarter pole and weakened. OFFICER MATUTE set the early pace along the rail but was through
early. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INTO THE START, THE STEWARDS DECLARED GALLINIPPER A NON-STARTER.

PHISH FAN set a clear pace in the three path and widened while drifting out a bit under left-handed urging. KINGSTON PIKE settled off the pace along the
inside and rallied inside of foes to gain the place. WHY JOEY WHY was in a bit tight at the start, advanced outside down the backstretch, chased the winner
in the three path around the turn, could not keep pace with that foe and was outfinished late for the place. SIR ROCKPORT made a four wide middle move
around the turn and flattened out in the lane. KEEPING THE PEACE chased the pace three wide and faded in the lane. AMERICANO was outrun outside.

MALIBU MISCHIEF set the pace in the two path and drew off readily while ridden out. SHE ANSWERED prompted the winner in the three path, was no
match for that foe in upper stretch but stayed on well enough to last for the place. GRAY HAZE raced off the pace inside, angled four wide nearing the lane
had a mild rally outside and just missed second. DREAMING DIAMONDS chase the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. BETTYANN failed to menace
while racing three and four wide.

up in deep stretch. BUSTIN HEARTS tracked the pacesetter in the clear two wide, took over nearing the eighth pole and led until deep stretch. FRAN'S
SALSA was pinched back at the start, raced two wide around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and was along late for the show. KAYLIE'S GIRL sprinted
clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail and tired in the lane. HEATHERLY came out and bumped a rival at the start, saved ground and never
threatened. BALLERINA KITTEN failed to menace while racing two wide.

Footnotes
W W SPRINGTIME stalked the pace in the two path, briefly waited for room nearing the lane, got through turning for home, quickly seized command, drew
clear in midstretch and held clear under a drive. HE'S SMOKIN NOW settled off the pace, raced three wide between rivals around the turn, angled in in
upper stretch and rallied between foes. BELLE TAPISSERIE stalked the early pace three wide, took the lead between rivals near the five-sixteenths pole,
continued on willingly but was no match for the winner in upper stretch and settled for the show. TOMMY SHELBY raced off the pace outside, made a five
wide run around the far turn and lacked the needed stretch rally. TIP FOR TAP raced in midpack early, bid four wide between foes around the far turn,
reached near even terms near the quarter pole then weakened in the lane. TAKE YOUR PLACE played no factor while racing two and three wide.
PERFECT COVER set a clear pace inside, gave way near the five-sixteenths marker, steadied while tiring leaving the quarter pole and retreated through
the lane.

Footnotes
ALWAYSINAHURRY set a clear pace in the two path and widened under left-handed urging. INDIAN LAKE tracked the pace four wide, continued on the left
lead in the lane and was clearly second best. BIG DADDY BUZZ raced well back two wide, angled widest in upper stretch and was along for the show.
GAMING JACK chased the pace four wide and lacked a rally. CLEVER AND GREAT failed to menace while racing two and three wide between rivals. THE
KING CHEEK stalked the pace three wide and tired in the drive. FRANKIE Z was outrun inside. JAQUAVIOUS had some speed inside and was through
after a half.
