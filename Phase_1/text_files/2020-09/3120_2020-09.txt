Footnotes
GELATO AMORE brushed the gate at the start, moved up three wide effortlessly to stalk the duelers, stayed in the three path on the turn, engaged the
leaders at the eighth pole and drove by nearing the sixteenth pole, a comfortable winner at the wire. SYSTEMIC RISK led quickly from the gate, allowed a
rival up her inside to duel with her around the bend, lost the front momentarily in upper stretch but regained her advantage by the eighth pole, immediately
tackled and passed by the winner, staying game to hold the place. FASHION FLIRT chased along the inside, came off the rail in upper stretch and followed
the winner's path in the final sixteenth, only able to garner the show spot with her rally. AUNT TILLIE chased outside, was three to four wide advancing on
the turn and widest as they turned for home, continuing to inch up down the stretch while widest. BONNIE LEE rushed up inside the early leader to duel that
one down the backside and through the turn, took a brief lead in upper stretch but couldn't match and lost positions in the final seventy yards. WAKE UP
MAGGIE dropped back quickly and taken over to the fence to trail the field, moved up inside to three wide on the turn, working her way closer to the rail
down the lane while showing some eagerness late. KA GEE GEE settled in mid pack, was between runners when steadied slightly on the turn, no bid
forthcoming after that incident. NOT A HOUSE FRAU broke out at the start and dropped off the pace, trailed throughout the turn while two to four wide,
never reaching contention.

Footnotes
CLOSE IMAGE pressed the pace in hand from the rail, angled out leaving the turn, rallied, came out in the final 16th shutting off CRUMLIN QUEEN and was
up late under a drive. MYSTIC NILE pressed the pace also in hand as were all five of the runners in the early going, forced the issue on the turn, gained
command near the furlong marker but was caught in the late stages. DESERT POEM was rated off the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn,
was hustled into the stretch and was all out but was bumped by CRUMLIN QUEEN in the final 16th then chased to the end. POWER HOUSE set a reserved
pace, quickened on the turn, was passed mid stretch and gave way. CRUMLIN QUEEN pulled hard from mid pack on the backstretch, was hustled three
and four-wide on the turn, was pinched back in the final 16th and caught the back end of DESERT POEM then evened out. THE JOCKEY ON CRUMLIN
QUEEN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST CLOSE IMAGE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL 16TH. ALSO, THE TRAINER OF DESERT POEM
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST CLOSE IMAGE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL 16TH. THE STEWARDS INQUIRY AND SUBSEQUENT
REVIEW OF THE INCIDENTS IN THE STRETCH RESULTED IN CLOSE IMAGE BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST BEHIND CRUMLIN
QUEEN.

Footnotes
STARLIGHT RIDGE stalked the pace, took the lead leaving the turn, drew clear and held under a drive. SHANGHAI BOUND bumped with BIG CHEEKS at
the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn, launched a determined stretch drive and was gaining steadily. VENUS VERITY stalked the
pace, came three ands four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. CEDAR VALLEY settled off the pace, was checked hard
early turn to avoid the fallen rider, chased into the stretch, altered course when encountering traffic a furlong out and rallied. QUEEN BEACH broke inward,
settled in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn but evened out in deep stretch. L'AMOUR TOUJOURS raced from off the pace, was checked hard
early turn to avoid the fallen rider, was hustled along then showed some interest in the stretch. LETTER ROLL, bumped by QUEEN BEACH at the outset,
was steadied slightly early early turn from the outside of the fallen rider, closed four and five-wide, then evened out late. IN PURSUIT forced the pace,
backed away late turn but lacked a closing response. SWEET EDITION set a pressured pace, shook clear into the turn, was headed approaching the top of
the stretch and faded. BIG CHEEKS, bumped at the start, raced in mid pack, clipped heels early turn and fell, unseating her rider and walked off. A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT CONCERNING BIG CHEEKS ON THE TURN LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.
