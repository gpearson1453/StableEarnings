Footnotes
STYLIN N PROFILIN, urged between foes disputing the pace into first turn, dueled for command outside a rival into the far turn and edged clear under
strong handling. FLASH FLOOD, urged along the rail prompting the pace, dueled for command into upper stretch but proved only second best. TIMBER
LADY, pinched back at the start, settled into stride near the inside, split foes entering the far turn, swung four wide racing into upper stretch and found her
best stride late. MISS STEELE JONES settled off the leaders while angling inside early, swung out six wide entering the lane and made some belated
progress. CANTERBURY GOLD, urged to a forward placing four wide into the first turn, tracked three deep off the leaders to the second bend, was urged to
lodge a brief bid nearing the lane and faded in the drive. PILOTS STAR, urged to a forward placing between foes racing to the first turn, was eased off the
leaders entering the backstretch to track along the inside but steadily faded. FOR SARAS SAKE settled well back early and passed only tiring rivals. LEFT
OF CENTER made brief pursuit of the leaders three wide to the backstretch, angled in entering the far turn and gave way. ANNIE'S SHENANIGAN tracked
off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch but offered no rally. MARLEY BE GOOD dropped out early.

Footnotes
BIG FALCON ROCKET angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to bid along the rail entering the far turn,
gained a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, drifted out entering the lane momentarily impeding PUBLIC SAFETY but was righted to turn back a
challenge from CARAMEL ANGEL in the closing stages to prove best under firm right handed encouragement. The latter was prompted to a forward placing
along the rail racing to the first turn, was eased off the pace entering the backstretch, swung out on the far turn to race five wide into the lane, loomed
outside the winner but was just outkicked. FINN COUNTRY tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening half, continued under light reserve while
waiting into the second bend, drifted five wide on the far turn, angled six wide in the lane and continued with late interest to prevail for a share. CAPTAIN
DRAKE tracked off the second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced four wide to challenge racing into the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch.
PUBLIC SAFETY tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, was urged to bid for command three wide between foes on the far turn, lost some
momentum when caught in tight quarters entering the lane and had no final response. WARRIOR BOSS was held up between foes in early stages, shifted
outside foes to race widest through the far turn to the lane and proved no threat. CANDY PRINCE, urged forcing the pace outside rivals into the first turn,
pressed the issue outside a rival through the backstretch and gave way between foes racing into the far turn. WESTONS WILDCAT, urged between foes
disputing the pace into the first turn, angled inside dueling for command through the backstretch and gave way into the far turn.

Footnotes
ME SAY SO broke readily, tracked just off the leaders four wide between foes in early stages, was urged to advance three deep between foes nearing the
lane to challenge for command, wrested a narrow advantage and edged forward under strong handling. WITHHERBOOTSON angled to the inside tracking
off the first flight from out of striking distance in the opening quarter, saved ground to upper stretch and advanced inside rivals to prevail for the place
honors. ROSEHILL ROAD, urged inside rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, continued to resist between rivals
entering the lane but weakened in late stages. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, forwardly placed three deep between rivals in early stages, angled inwards entering the
turn and continued evenly between foes late. SUNDANCE STAR, caught five wide racing through the backstretch tracking just off the first flight racing into
the turn, had no closing bid. SHE'S EXALTED, caught six wide in early stages, angled inwards nearing the turn but lacked a closing response. THAT
WOULD BE NICE, urged between foes pressing the pace racing into the turn, gained a brief lead nearing upper stretch but faltered entering the lane. TIKA
TOY settled between foes in early stages and failed to menace.

COME ON SWEET PEA tracked just off the first flight along the inside into the backstretch, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch to challenge for
command and edged forward through the stretch under brisk left handed pressure to prove best. IMMINENT THREAT was rated off the second flight along
the inside to the backstretch, gathered momentum inside the eventual winner leaving the far turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch, then altered course
abruptly twice into the lane but continued with interest just inside the winner to prevail for the place honors. ALL NATIVE, caught five wide into the first turn
tracking well off the second flight, angled to the inside racing through the backstretch, steadily gained position inside foes racing into the far turn, swung five
wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to prevail for a share. SHAY'S GLORY, urged to the lead while angling over racing to the backstretch, disputed
the pace a bit off the rail, angled inside on the far turn dueling for command to upper stretch but weakened in the drive. WEE MS. BURNZIE, caught wide
racing into the first turn, angled in nearing the backstretch and continued with an even effort to improve position between foes. BINDING TIME, urged
prompting a rival's pace to the backstretch, dueled for command into upper stretch and gave way. LIL' RED DEVIL settled last racing to the backstretch and
passed only tiring rivals. ORTS DREAM tracked off the first flight outside the leaders and offered no rally. TEMPLES MON CHERI tracked the leaders
between foes in second flight to the backstretch and faded into the far turn. TANTIMA, caught four wide between foes racing through the first turn to the
backstretch, soon retreated. DREAMING BIZ tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening half and emptied out entering the far turn.

READY TO RUNAWAY raced unhurried between foes in the opening stages while climbing a bit when appearing to dislike the going, was prompted to
advance while shifting out four wide leaving the midway point of the turn, moved to wrest command in that path racing into upper stretch and went clear
under firm right handed encouragement. PINUP GIRL settled well off the field racing to the turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch and produced her best
stride in the closing stages to prevail for the place honors at the wire. RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC, urged prompting a rival's pace racing through the
backstretch, dueled for command between foes into upper stretch and gave out late. DIVA DE KELA angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight,
made sharp progress along the rail to challenge for command inside the leaders entering the lane but quickly flattened out. ARI GIA, off a bit awkwardly,
was urged along the inside pursuing the leaders, shifted out nearing upper stretch and quickly came up empty. DEFEND THE ROSE was hustled up the rail
setting the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, drifted out nearing upper stretch and abruptly gave out.

Footnotes
DROP OF GOLDEN SUN broke readily, was prompted to dictate the pace on a clear margin racing well off the rail to the backstretch, was urged to maintain
a safe advantage nearing upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm handling. DAME PLATA shifted inwards avoiding close quarters just after the
start, tracked the pacesetter between foes into the backstretch, angled in to bid inside the leader nearing upper stretch, shifted outside that foe entering the
lane and continued with a grudging effort under brisk handling to prevail for the place honors while failing to gain even terms with the winner. TWOKO BAY
broke out bumping TRI SPOT, was righted to race inside rivals as part of the second flight in the opening three furlongs, was eased back from that position
midway through the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, was prompted to advance inside foes entering the lane and edged a rival for a share nearing
the wire. HOT SHOT KID tracked the pacesetter three deep between foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
while shifting out three wide nearing the lane, was fanned four wide in upper stretch and finished evenly late. EL TIZAR, urged to a forward placing four wide
tracking just off the pacesetter into the first turn, continued outside foes in the second flight and faded racing into the far turn. TRI SPOT, bumped at the
start, settled last to the backstretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
CLICKBAIT was rated off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted four wide entering the second bend steadily gaining on the leaders,
moved to wrest command while shifting inwards racing into upper stretch, kicked away under left handed pressure and was taken in hand late once the
issue was decided. HOTASAPISTOL, urged between foes, then along the inside disputing the pace into the backstretch, dueled for command into upper
stretch and proved best of the others while no match. TWO BE ROYAL, restless in the gate, was rated along the inside tracking off the second flight to the
backstretch, switched out after a half, steadily gained position between foes, angled four wide nearing upper stretch and continue with interest to gain a
share. FIRSTMATE switched well off the inside early tracking off the first flight four wide to the backstretch, was fanned five wide into the lane but lacked the
needed late kick. LILA'S LUCKY LADY, urged to a forward placing along the rail, tracked just off the leaders along the inside to the far turn but came up
empty in the drive. DOUBLE BEE STING, held up in close quarters four deep between foes racing through the first turn, failed to menace thereafter.
MAYWOOD HOPE, caught five wide between foes racing into the first turn, was prompted to gain position outside foes through the backstretch, moved to
challenge three deep racing into the far turn gaining a brief advantage but flattened out once headed by the winner in upper stretch. SHE B GLAMOROUS,
caught six wide racing to the backstretch, proved no threat. HONEY'S SOX APPEAL was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the backstretch,
dueled between foes into the far turn and gave way into the lane.

STAR OF THE NORTH was urged to the lead outside a rival in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a clear margin to upper stretch, then widened the
advantage through late stages under firm urging and right handed pressure. HELL OF THE NORTH, urged inside rivals prompting the pace, shifted outside
the leader nearing upper stretch but couldn't gain terms with that foe while just prevailing for the place honors. OWEN'S PLEASURE settled outside foes in
the opening stages, angled out five wide entering the lane and found her best stride late to just miss for second. PRETTI TA KELA, bumped at the start, was
urged along the three deep between foes pursuing the leaders into the turn and emptied out entering the lane. ROZEY CHEEKS was rated off the first flight
while angling to the inside racing into the turn, gained some position inside foes after a half but flattened out nearing midstretch. MOLLY'S ANGEL tracked
just off the leaders racing four deep into the turn and steadily faded. MINNESOTA NICE broke outwards bumping PRETTI TA KELA and dropped out early.

Footnotes
FIREMAN OSCAR was settled along the rail dropping into last racing through the backstretch, gathered momentum leaving the midway point of the turn,
shifted out nearing upper stretch to split foes, angled back to the inside to bid for command nearing the furlong marker, wrested the advantage and went
clear under firm hand urging. CINCO STAR was settled well off the leaders while shifting out racing into the turn, swung five wide racing into upper stretch
while being prompted to advance and edged a rival for the place honors late. RAY'S ANGEL, urged between foes prompting the pace in the opening stages,
went clear nearing upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum once headed by the winner. ASTRONAUT OSCAR was urged inside rivals prompting
the pace into the turn and came up empty entering the lane. MISTER BANJOMAN, a step slow into stride, made brief pursuit of the leaders three wide
racing into the turn and gave way nearing the lane. WEEKEND RIDE was rated just off the first flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper
stretch and quickly emptied out.
