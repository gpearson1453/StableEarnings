Footnotes
ABBY'S DESTINY was allowed to settle early, made a five wide sweep on the turn, drew clear past the eighth pole, then held on late to prove best, driving.
WEIGHTLESSNESS chased the early pace from the inside, then eased out two wide by the quarter pole, angled out past the eighth pole, closed fast late to
just miss. BACKSEAT PROMISES was taken back early and moved to the inside, then swung out six wide for the drive for racing room, offered a good late
rally but too late. DIRTY DIXIE ROAD dueled for the early lead on the inside, stayed on grudgingly while fading late. MAST COVE tracked the early pace
from between rivals, then came into the stretch seven wide but offered no significant punch. LUCY TOO dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid
on the turn to edged clear past the quarter pole, but weakened in the final furlong. TAPJEN stalked the early pace four wide then stopped.

PRESCIENCE stalked the early pace three wide, made a three wide bid past the quarter pole, took a short lead past the eighth pole, then dug in gamely late
to edge away to prove best, driving. LITTLE MAEMI was well placed early, then swung out five past the quarter pole for racing room, made a strong bid at
the winner leaving the furlong marker, but kept trying to lug in the final sixteenth while hanging, 2nd best. NAUGHTY JUSTICE stumbled at the start, then
was sent up on the inside to set the pace, relinquished the lead past the three eighths pole, then made a rebid to vie for the lead past the quarter pole, but
faded in the drive, bested rest. BACKHAND was five wide into the first turn, then made a five wide middle move past the half mile pole, crossed over while
gaining the lead to the two path past the three eighths pole then was empty late. EXPLOSIVE JUSTICE was allowed to settle early, came into the lane four
wide but offered no rally. DOWNDELANE was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide on the backstretch then tired. ROSIE DUBAI showed

THE BEAUTY'S TALE was allowed to settle early while three wide on the backstretch, made a bid three wide on the far turn, hit the front entering the stretch
and was clear past the eighth pole, then held sway late to prove best, driving. KYNANCE (IRE) was reserved early and raced three wide on the backstretch,
was sent down around the five sixteenths pole, came into the stretch six wide and rallied well, but was too late while second best. COMPLETE was void of
early speed and raced three wide on the backstretch, came into the stretch three wide while starting to unwind, then had to alter course in midstretch,
angled out late and closed fast. SONG RIVER stalked the early pace three wide, made a bid three wide past the quarter pole to vie for command, but could
not sustain that bid while fading late. HALAMA was rated off the front two and raced on the inside on the backstretch, moved into contention on the turn, but
was shut off past the quarter pole, swung out four wide at the top of the stretch but was empty. DISTINCTIVE FLOWER set a fast pace on the inside for six

Footnotes
BREAKERS POINT was sent to the front to set the pace while unchallenged, dawdled along then drew off past the eighth pole and was kept to mild urging
to prove much the best. UNBRIDLED REBEL was rated early, came into the stretch while making a bid but needed more. ITASCA was allowed to settle
early, came into the stretch five wide to have a mild late rally. MR. SARCASTIC was reserved early, split rivals while two wide entering the stretch then
offered a belated rally. BRIAR JUMPER was void of early speed moved on the far turn and came into the stretch four wide but offered no serious rally late
while experiencing some traffic in the stretch. G FRIDAY chased the pace three wide then faded. SUGAR DOG FOX was reserved early, then was four wide
past the quarter pole, then was fanned out eight wide at the top of the stretch while being no threat. LEA RIDGE dropped back while saving ground.
