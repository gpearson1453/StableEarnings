inside trip and was outkicked for the show spot. TAKEITTOCOMITTEE set the pace on the inside, briefly dueled with the winner on the turn, then weakened.

and tired. VINAIGRETTE chased the leaders in the early stages and gave way.

Footnotes
SHARE THE RIDE away alertly to set the pace, raced a bit off the inside, showed the way on the turn, responded when roused, turned back a bid from
AWESOME ANYWHERE at the top of the lane and drew clear under urging. AWESOME ANYWHERE stalked outside in the early stages, moved up three
wide on the turn, rallied outside entering the stretch, was no match for the winner and clear for the place award. MIND CONTROL was in a bit in the early
stages and shuffled back at the half mile marker, moved up outside on the turn, went four wide past the quarter pole and rallied mildly outside in the final
furlong. WENDELL FONG raced three wide off the pace, continued three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. EPIC DREAMER raced off the pace inside,
came three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. SPEIGHTSFORD tracked inside, chased inside on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
GRIMGRINNIN' GHOST tracked close up on the inside, came through on the rail to challenge nearing the far turn, took charge on the turn, pulled away and
was ridden out. PURCHASING POWER raced off the rail, off the pace, chased the leaders on the far turn, came five wide into the lane, closed steadily
outside and wore down ALGORIX in deep stretch to earn the place spot. ALGORIX set the pace racing a bit off the inside, dueled two wide on the far turn,
dug in through the lane and lost second at the wire. SYCAMORE LANE raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn, rallied inside entering the
stretch and weakened. VIPER had his head turned sideways in the hands of the starter and dwelt at the start, then outrun. OUT OF LINE raced three wide
early, then stalked two wide, bid three wide on the turn and faded. TREASURY STOCK was outrun. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, VIPER was
declared a non starter.
