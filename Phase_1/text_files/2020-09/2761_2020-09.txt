Footnotes
UPTOWN was well placed early, rallied at the quarter pole and drew even, prevailed late after a long stretch battle. BRIG set the pace and dueled on the
with the winner, held grudgingly in the drive and was clearly second best. TO WIN was well placed throughout, lacked a late bid and went evenly. TALE OF
LACEY was off slowly and was allowed to settle, raced three wide and was no threat. OHIO CAUSE was never far back on the inside, had no late response.
JIMTOWN was no factor. EL MEZCALITO flashed brief foot and was through early.

and quickly made the lead, led every jump but the last one. LEM ME TEL YA was never far back, saved ground and was no threat to the top two.
LABYRINTH was allowed to settle and failed to menace. ADVENTUROUS FOX contended early and weakened in mid stretch.

Footnotes
KISSINGER dueled early, drew clear in the stretch under left handed urging. HISTORICALLY was allowed to settle early swung wide in the stretch and
rallied to be second best. JUDGE HEAD was well placed throughout, lacked a late response and went evenly. BISCUITS AND GRITS allowed to settle,
failed to menace. MOBIL BREEZE was no factor. HOME RUN POWER set a pressured pace and tired in the lane. ROMEO POWER flashed brief foot,and
was through early.
