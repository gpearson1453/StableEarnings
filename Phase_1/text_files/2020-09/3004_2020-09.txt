the backstretch, came through the far turn about the three path, and while outfinished for second the final sixteenth, was just up for third. MINI BOLT raced
in the four path the opening turn then bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn four wide and finished evenly. BRUTUS BRAE entered
the first turn in the five path then settled off the pace toward the inside from the half mile pole, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the
far turn and finished evenly. FEAR THE LATI took the lead two deep at the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the five
sixteenths pole, raced clear through the far turn and dug in under steadily handling, but was caught inside the sixteenth pole and weakened later yards.

TAKE ME HOME became a bit edgy in the gate then stalked the early pace three wide, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and took the lead at the
five sixteenths, raced clear into the far turn and widened with steady stretch insistence. AUSSIE GOLD rounded the first turn in the four path and settled
close outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole and came through the far turn in the three path then dueled for second through the
upper stretch. ALLISON K saved ground off the early pace then bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled between horses two deep on the far turn, ceded
second mid-stretch then flattened later yards. ALPINE MOON saved ground into the first turn and settled off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole,
eased four wide on the far turn and showed little in the stretch. BIRD TRAFFIC rounded the first turn in the five path and was well off the pace leaving the
turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, came through the far turn five wide and had little left. SHERWOOD LADY showed the way with a slim
lead early on and was pressured toward the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the advantage at the five sixteenths pole, dropped back into the far turn then
weakened. FLOATING BY rounded the first turn in the three path and showed little response down the backstretch. SINGINDOWNTHELANE raced with the
pace two deep while between horses then challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, but dropped back approaching the quarter and faded at the rail on
the far turn. Per Stewards Ruling # 66, Take Me Home has been disqualified from earnings.

Footnotes
COACH RUBE accelerated to the lead at the five sixteenths pole and dueled clear into the turn, then widened under steady stretch encouragement. ARTY'S
SECRET gave chase and kept aim three wide on the turn but had to settle for second. NICE N' BROAD gave chase, rounded the turn in the five path and
dug in to take third mid-stretch. TUNSTALL chased the leaders then saved ground into the turn, angled to the four path toward the head of the lane but
flattened stride. SWEETONTHEGENTS set the pace through the opening quarter mile but was caught at the five sixteenths pole, dropped back at the
quarter and weakened leaving the turn. MAMA DUNE gave early chase toward the inside then eased to the seven path on the turn and showed little more.
PIMM AND PROPER chased the pace through the backstretch and saved ground into the turn, then angled to the seven path toward the head of the lane.
INSPIRED GEM rounded the turn about the three path and was outrun. WE LOVE NANNI raced at the rail on the turn then weakened. WILD CAPPUCINO
brushed the gate at the break and was not a factor.

ANY WAY NOW took quick control to rate the pace then came under pressure past the five sixteenths pole, raced clear midway on the far turn and was
steadily handled to hold on well. RUM RUNNER RED settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn then started a bid leaving the half mile pole, circled
rivals in the six path of the far turn, got up for second mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner. WISH IN THE CASTLE settled off the pace in the three
and four paths then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and dug in for third mid-stretch. FAPPIANO ROCKET stalked the
pace from the two and three paths then challenged toward the five sixteenths, but, dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened. RIDING CLOUD
NINE hesitated and brushed the gate and was bumped shortly after the break then raced well back, raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase
into the far turn, came through the turn about the five path then passed rivals down the lane. PROVIDENCE R V F saved early ground then bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, was forced five wide nearing the head of the lane then weakened. BAT TWO ONE settled off the pace about the three path then
picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, angled four wide nearing the head of the lane then weakened. LIL MR MATT came away very awkwardly
and ducked out to make contact with Providence R V F, saved ground off the pace then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, though, weakened
at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
MABEL saved ground off the pace then bid leaving the three eighths pole, came between horses two deep toward the top of the stretch, dug in for the lead
approaching the sixteenths pole and held on well. CANDYFORACAUSE settled inside through the opening turn then bid leaving the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail then angled four wide into the lane and dug in to take second later yards. SHE GIVES ME FITS stalked the pace off the rail
then challenged from the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead nearing the three eighths and dueled at even terms, inched clear midway on the far turn but
was caught toward the sixteenth pole and ceded second later yards. COMPLETE SURPRISE saved ground into the opening turn and settled close entering
the backstretch, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole and raced five wide on the far turn then flattened stride the final furlong. SO RED THE ROSE raced well
back off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and could only improve her position. INTROSPECTION showed
little response past the three eighths pole. UNA BUENA MAMACITA rounded the opening turn about the four path then rated close, picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole but weakened three wide nearing the top of the lane. YOUR EYES TO MINE set the early pace inside then came under
pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole, was caught at the three eighths and continued in close chase, though, dropped back midway on the far turn and
weakened. THANK YOU GIRL was never a factor. LOVE HAPPY was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
BOUNDTOBEGOOD chased the earlier pace toward the inside, angled five wide mid turn and dug in to out-game FIREBIRD to the wire, while the latter of
whom, chased the pace inside then angled three wide leaving the turn and was outfinished, while trying gamely, through later yards. CARTHAGE pressured
the pace and contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, dueled to a slim brief lead mid-stretch but was outrun through later yards.
KULANI hesitated leaving the gate and raced well back from early contention, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn two deep
and finished well. CHRIS' CHEROKEEBOP was hustled along to set a pressured pace and contested the edge two deep on the turn, gave up the lead
mid-stretch and flattened stride the final sixteenth. GRANDPA LOUIE chased the pace off the rail then left the turn four wide and weakened the final furlong.
SYNERGY UNBRIDLED gave chase and rounded the turn about the four path, then proved empty down the lane. GATTOSING chased the pace inside and
weakened leaving the turn. LAST TRAIN OUT chased the pace then followed DESTRUCTION wide on the turn, while the latter chased the pace then bore
out into the turn, was immediately eased and walked off.
