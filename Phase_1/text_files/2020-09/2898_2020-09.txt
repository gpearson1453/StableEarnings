Footnotes
EASTBOUND N DOWN set a well reserved pace inside, pulled himself clear midway on the turn and drew away to win handily. REDOUBTABLE engaged in
close early chase but dropped back in the three path midway on the turn, was not a match for the winner but dug in to retain second. MINI BOLT gave
chase and rounded the turn about the four path then dug in through the stretch to gain on the runner-up. BRILLIANT IDEAS chased the pace, rounded the
turn at the rail and finished evenly under steady encouragement. SHARP'S MISSION chased the leaders from the outside, rounded the turn in the five path
and showed little more.

Footnotes
TRELLIS settled off the early pace outside, started a bid past the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn off the rail then dueled to the lead in the upper
stretch and widened with an aggressive hand ride. I AM AINE chased the pace from the two and three paths, drifted to the six path toward the head of the
lane but dug in to take second the final yards. TAR HEEL PALACE gave chase and rounded the turn near the rail, eased out entering the stretch then
outfinished for second the final yards. NO SUGAR NO CREAM rated the early pace inside then came under pressure midway on the turn, gave up the lead
past the eighth pole and flattened stride the final sixteenth. TRINNI FLOWER stalked the pace then picked up the chase toward the five sixteenths pole, but
faded approaching the head of the lane. MNEMOSYNE gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn in the five and six paths and never factored.

RIP THORN saved ground off the pace the first turn then started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced three wide on the far turn, drifted a bit into the
lane and took the lead at the eighth pole when River Crosroad Rvf bolted, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. J J WEDGIT MAN saved ground well
off the pace then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, angled four wide into the stretch and dug in to take second later
yards. OCASIONALY CLASSY settled off the pace saving ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced mostly at the rail on the far turn and
appeared to be a factor a furlong away but flattened stride the final sixteenth. SWING BATTER raced with the early pace two deep then stalked into the first
turn, took a brief lead at the seven sixteenths pole then gave chase from the three eighths, remained close two deep on the far turn but flattened stride
inside the eighth pole. LUCKY PENGUIN dropped well off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch. BOP MARLEY raced off the rail the
opening turn and left the turn outside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded into the far turn. RIVER CROSROAD RVF rated the pace inside then
briefly gave up the lead at the seven sixteenths pole, recovered control past the three eighths and raced with the edge near the rail into the far turn, but,
bolted at the eighth pole and took himself out of the race. The Stewards posted the inquiry before making this race official.

UNCANNY gave chase about the four path and took the lead midway on the turn, then dueled clear later yards. BABY JEAN pressured the pace and took a
brief lead nearing the quarter pole, was caught mid turn but remained a close factor to mid-stretch before giving way to the winner, then just held on for
second. HENDAYA gave chase toward the inside and rounded the turn just off the rail, finished well and just missed the nod for second. FLEETRESS
chased the pace while saving ground, angled to the outside leaving the turn and finished evenly. GINGER IN DISGUISE engaged in close early chase about
the three path, raced close through the turn but flattened out the final sixteenth. ONE ODD STORY was hustled along the rail to take the lead at the seven
sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, gave up the lead nearing the quarter pole then faded through the turn. TORNERO was not a factor racing wide.

Footnotes
DIMITRI'S ROMANCE settled off the early pace then gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, then dug in down the lane to get up the final strides. MISS
TSCHETTER pressured the pace two deep then took the lead nearing the quarter pole, kept the edge through the turn and dug in under steady stretch
encouragement, but was overcome the final strides. UNKISS ME gave chase and raced at the rail on the turn and finished well. SHANGHAI MISTRESS
broke in the air then picked up the chase leaving the chute, rounded the turn about the three path and finished evenly. ZIRCON ZLOTY was hustled to the
lead to set a pressured pace, gave up the lead nearing the quarter pole, remained close through the turn but dropped back mid-stretch and flattened stride.
INTRACTABLE gave chase and rounded the turn about the four path. SILENT NOTION gave chase inside and raced at the rail on the turn. KATIE'S
BAYOU gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the six path. WAY AHEAD OF YOU was never a factor.

MY FRIENDS BEER settled close in the two and three paths then challenged toward the three eighths pole, moved to even terms nearing the five
sixteenths, took the edge approaching the quarter and raced clear midway on the far turn then drew away the final furlong. K TOWN BRASS angled to the
inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was met at even terms approaching the five sixteenths and gave up the
advantage nearing the quarter, dropped back at the rail mid turn and had to settle for second best. OUT OF CENTS saved ground close to the early pace
then bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little more. MEAN TO AMEND stalked the pace three wide
and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and had little left. PAPA RALPH J was shuffled back early on
and raced in the four and five paths the first turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed little more.
TRIPLE BAD settled off the pace and off the rail and showed little response past the three eighths pole. CAPTAIN CHARITABLE rounded the opening turn
about the four path and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, then weakened at the rail leaving the far turn. SILVER TAURUS lost ground
into the opening turn and never factored.

Footnotes
CAUSE FOR SURPRISE angled in to stalk from the three path then picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, surged to the front approaching the
quarter, dueled clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. KATMAN QUICK rated close inside then bid nearing the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then dueled through the stretch for second. SET'EM UP JOE settled off the pace in the three and four paths the
opening turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the four path most of the far turn, but angled in toward the head of the lane and was
outfinished in the stretch long duel for second. PARTICULARITY moved to the inside to rate the pace then came under pressure leaving the three eighths
pole, was caught at the rail approaching the quarter, dropped back midway on the far turn and had little left. A TRUE GENTLEMAN raced well off the pace
while saving early ground then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, then finished
evenly. FRENCH'S QUEST was eased to the five path the opening turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid toward the seven
sixteenths pole but flattened stride on the far turn. MANHATTAN PROJECT saved ground then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, though,
faded at the rail on the far turn. ENASOIT stalked the early pace two deep but showed little response past the seven sixteenths pole.
