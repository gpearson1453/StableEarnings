Footnotes
STOKES settled off the early pace, came two and three-wide through the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, rallied determinedly from the outside and
was up late under a drive. PINK SCRIBBLES settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn, rallied between foes but was out finished. BOBBI'S
LEGACY was sent to the early lead, set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch but lost her lead in deep stretch. FAITH OVER FEAR stalked
the pace, chased three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, was blocked mid stretch, angled out quickly and rallied in vain. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD
stalked the pacesetter, closed four-wide late turn, loomed dangerous upper stretch but evened out late. PEARL HEIST broke outward, forced the pace,
chased three-wide into the stretch but her rally stalled and she faded through the late stages. SEA ANNA DREAM stalked the pace, was pinched back and
checked hard entering the turn, was hustled along the rail late turn but tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
LOOKOUT LOUIE dueled from the rail, gained command upper stretch then was all out to hold in the late stages. GIANT ATTRACTION settled in mid pack
along the rail, eased back a bit early turn when his path appeared to be narrowing, the horse on the second path moved out just a little and the giant moved
quickly up the inside then in a fluid move angled out leaving the turn, was clear and determined, closed gamely in the stretch but missed by a nod. MIA'S
EXTORTIONIST broke inward and settled off the pace, chased hard late turn then closed steadily through the stretch. D MAGICIAN dueled, was headed
upper stretch and chased to the wire. DOUBLE THE HEART raced in mid pack, came three and four-wide through the turn then chased gamely in the
stretch. MC CULLEY settled off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn then finished evenly. EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR stalked early, raced
two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but flattened out late.

Footnotes
THE NEWFIE EXPRESS stalked the pace, took command late on the far turn and drew clear, widened upper stretch and finished under a brisk hand ride.
KUDURO bumped with JORDANS WAY leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, closed along the rail into the far turn, was hustled along then finished gamely.
OUR UNCLE DREW raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the far turn, angled out in the stretch and rallied gamely. RANGE OF MOTION settled in
mid pack, closed two to four-wide on the far turn then finished willingly to no avail. KYSLIOS'S JUSTICE was bumped at the start, raced in mid pack,
hugged the rail through the final turn then rallied along the inside rail. G PRINCE OF SILVER set a reserved pace, was headed late turn, chased into the
stretch and gave way. JORDANS WAY bumped with KUDURO leaving the gate, stalked the pace, was hustled four and five-wide on the far turn but lacked
a closing response. BIG TIME GIZMO settled in mid pack, chased hard two and three-wide on the far turn then evened out in the stretch. FAST THINKING
broke outward and bumped KYSLIOS'S JUSTICE and settled well off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the far turn and never reached contention.
CELTIC CHIEF lost his path at the start, closed to mid pack, dropped back on the far turn and lacked a rally. VIRGIL CAINE broke in the air and settled well
off the pace, trailed the field, was eased in the stretch, crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
SOUPER SENSATIONAL broke well and settled into a nice pocket trip behind the two leaders, stayed inside until late on the turn when traffic cleared and
she was able to come off the inside to take dead aim on the front runners, given her cue and cleared to the lead by the eighth pole, a handy winner better
than the margin indicated. SPEIGHTSTOWN SHIRL stalked the two leaders outside the winner, advanced between those two when room appeared midway
on the turn, engaged her stablemate turning into the lane, led in upper stretch but was immediately tackled by the winner, no match but a clear second best.
DIAMOND ORE sat in mid pack with an open gap trip, closed in on the leaders late on the turn, showing interest in the stretch but way off the top pair.
NORTHERN CROSS along the inside and off the pace, rallied from second last into the turn and three wide into the stretch, besting the balance but not in
the same area code as the winner. MIA AT MIDNIGHT chased inside before falling back and running greenly around the turn, hard to motivate with her
head in the air, finally figuring it out somewhat down the stretch with a mild late close. CARELESS HEIRESS dueled inside a rival before putting that one
away midway on the turn, headed by her stablemate turning for home and losing ground down the stretch. MUSICALLY INCLINED quick to lead, a rival
coming up her inside to battle her down the backstretch and into the turn, losing ground from midway on the bend and drifting out turning for home, tiring
from there to the wire. TRILLING SONG off the pace, rallied smartly two to three wide on the turn into range, but had nothing left for the stretch drive.
HORSESHOE FALLS trailed by open lengths, was roused into the turn but couldn't get in the hunt.

DEJAS TOO was pinched back at the start, chased four-wide on the far turn, bid a furlong out, was lugging in but still prevailed late. CONZIP raced in mid
pack, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, bid a furlong out, dueled, but was out finished. VERY SAVVY was herded inward at the start,
stalked the pace, bid on the far turn, gained a short lead at the top of the stretch but gave way a furlong out. MITZI, steadied at the outset, raced in mid
pack, came five-wide through the first turn, bid three-wide late on the far turn but gave way in the final furlong. ADMONISH broke inward and settled off the
pace, closed from the rail on the far turn then rallied determinedly. LEAVE IT WITH ME led early and drew away a comfortable distance, set a reserved
pace, was joined midway of the far turn then tired in the stretch. HOLY LIGHTING broke inward, settled in mid pack, chased hard two-wide on the far turn,
was all out in the stretch but evened out in the late stages. EL VALOR broke outward and settled off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the far turn then
finished evenly. MY DAD ROCKS was herded inward at the outset, raced in mid pack, dropped back on the far turn and lacked a rally. ERASMO'S GIRL
was steadied at the start, raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn then lacked a closing response. SENSATIONAL GIRL broke inward
and settled off the pace, trailed into the far turn, was eased approaching the stretch, crossed the wire and walked off.

FEELING FUNNY broke outward, showed speed and set a pressured pace, quickened late turn, widened in the stretch and finished under a hand ride.
EXCELLING pressed the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn but couldn't close the gap in the stretch. BUNCHKINS bumped with CARA
CATERINA at the start, had aim on the leaders from mid pack, ride the rail on the turn and was game in the stretch. FABIOLLA (GB) settled in mid pack,
was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then finished gamely in vain. LOTS TO LIKE raced in mid pack, came along the rail then two-wide through the
turn and was all out in the stretch. CARA CATERINA, bumped at the start, settled off the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn but never reached
contention. DID I STUTTER settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then evened out in the stretch. SMARTY ILLUSION was off
slowly, settled well off the pace, came two to four-wide through the turn but was was never in contention. TWISTER ALERT was also away slowly, raced in
mid pack during her rail trip then lacked a rally.

SUMMER SUNDAY led into 1st turn, set a strongly reserved pace, let her loose a notch on the far turn then held sway under steady handling. ART OF
ALMOST raced in mid pack, closed three-wide late turn, rallied full out in the stretch and was just up for place. SOUPER ESCAPE stalked the pace, chased
two-wide on the far turn, was determined in the stretch but lost position late. SILENT TANGO, away slowly and rated off the pace, saved ground, then rallied
mildly. AUNTIE KATHERINE stalked the pace early then settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail on the far turn then chased through the stretch.
STRIKE AT DAWN raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn but failed to menace. ROYAL WEDDING, in range, chased two and
three-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
ROMAN D'ORO was taken back early, advanced without urging three to four wide on the turn, drove by while laying in at the sixteenth pole, holding off her
stablemate late. ALL QUALITY off the pace and along the inside, came four wide late on the turn, in behind her stablemate and eventual winner while wide
in upper stretch, lay in down the lane and couldn't get by late, still getting in a tad nearing the wire. SPANISH BALLERINA sped to the front, had a clear
edge until the sixteenth pole when the winner went by, drifting in a bit for the final stages while tiring. BELIEVE IN BEAUTY (IRE) stalked the leader
throughout, took a run at her turning for home but never could get by, staying on for a minor award. GOLDEN VISION was trailing the field into the turn,
rallied and tipped out into the five path in upper stretch, running by rivals down the stretch, a solid burst through the final sixteenth. FAIRYWREN sat along
the rail in mid pack, angled out to the three path late on the turn, was in behind a wall in upper stretch, shifted down to the fence, was closed off by the tiring
leader, then tried to go between the two tiring pacesetters late in the stretch but lost her path again, giving up at that point, obviously not her or her rider's
lucky day. ISHIYAYA chased along the inside, angled out in upper stretch but came up empty when asked between rivals when the real running began.
TEACHER'S PET was second last into the turn, having no response when asked down the stretch. SHORT SUMMER DRESS rushed up to wide stalk after
a stutter step start, two to three wide on the turn before losing ground down the stretch. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
SAY HEY (FR) stalked the pace two-wide throughout, chased into the stretch, drew even a 16th out and drove clear then held late running rivals off for the
victory. ANN OF CLEVES broke inward and settled in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and
rallied with determination. COOL SOCIETY bumped with MISS BOBBIT leaving the gate, raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn
then chased through the stretch. VESPOLINA bumped with MISS BOBBIT and then UNDER THE EYE at the outset, settled off the pace, was unhurried to
the far turn then closed quickly angling from two to four-wide and rallied outside. UNDER THE EYE, bumped at the start, showed speed and led into the first
turn, set a pressured pace, shook clear on the far turn, was hustled into the stretch but was collared a 16th out and gave way. QUEEN'S SPEED settled off
the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the far turn then rallied late between foes. APPELLA hopped out of the gate then settled off the pace,
came two to four-wide through the final turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the late stages. ROLLING SLOAN broke alertly and led very briefly
then stalked from the rail on the turns, chased into the stretch but evened out late. MISS BOBBIT, bumped with horses from both sides at the start, forced
the pace, chased the leader on the far turn but began to back away approaching the stretch and faded.
