GRATS ROAD chased the pace early, made a bid three wide nearing the lane, edged clear of leader near the eighth pole and drew away in the late stages.
I DREAM OF LOIS tracked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane with the lead but was no match for the winner in the stretch run. C
ISLANDSURPRISE set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane then was taken up hard and faltered in the stretch drive. CARINA raced back early on,
was in the six path into the lane and moved up in the stretch. MATT'S HONEY trailed the field early on, was in the five path into the lane and improved
position. LADY BLUE chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane while making a bid but faded down the lane. LUCKY BE A LADY was through
after a half. The rider of C ISLANDSURPRISE claimed an objection against the rider of I DREAM OF LOIS for interference entering the lane but after review
by the stewards the claim was disallowed.

EXEMPLAR was well placed early on, made a bid nearing the lane, was in the four path into the lane, drove past the leader near the eighth pole and drew
away late while geared down to the wire. MATROOH set the pace early, widened a bit nearing the lane, was off the rail into the lane, overtaken near the
eighth pole and no match for the winner in the final stages. MARK MY WAY stalked the pace early along the inside, was in the three path into the lane and
no match for the top two. ORIGINAL INTENT hopped at the start and trailed the field early on, raced widest into the lane and down the lane with a belated
gain in the final stages. MARTIAL EAGLE tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. STAR DOG was
never a factor. CHOP CHOP CHARLIE was done early.

Footnotes
ORO DE TEJANO chased the pace early along the inside, was moved out nearing the quarter pole, raced along the four path into the lane, rallied down the
lane while being ridden hard, drove past the leader near the sixteenth pole and cleared the field in the final stages. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER vied for the lead
early five wide, was backed off the early pace, came again and made a bid three wide near the three eighths pole, inched clear near the eighth pole but
yielded in the final sixteenth. ATMOS vied for the lead early three wide, was in the five path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. RUNNIN'
RAY vied for the lead along the inside, stayed on the inside into the lane and faltered down the lane. RAYO DE LUZ vied for the lead early two wide, was off
the rail into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch drive. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY was never a threat. ICECAP was never a factor. LEMNISCATE had
early speed then folded up.

Footnotes
OXIDE tracked the pace four wide around the turn, forged placed while shifting down to the three path turning for home with the clear leader to catch, then
ran down that foe at the sixteenth pole under a long drive, and won going away. SEA OF HOPE was forwardly placed three wide and between horses, split
the leaders leaving the chute to bid for the lead two wide and between horses at the three quarter pole, vied before drawing clear of his inner counterpart at
the seven sixteenth pole, held a clear margin turning for home and through midstrech, but was run down by an outer foe at the sixteenth pole, and proved
second best. ADHHAR pulled from midpack along the inside down the backstretch to a stalking position right behind the leaders at the five furlong pole,
where the rider had to tap on the breaks, then got shuffled back behind the tiring early leader into the turn, lost multiple lengths worth of position, shifted four
wide between horses turning for home, and stayed on for a minor reward. EL SUPREMO was forwardly placed two wide and between horses, but failed to
keep pace with the leaders turning for home, and did not menace while besting tired foes. JACK'S ADVANTAGE trailed the field two wide into and around
the turn, swung five wide turning for home, but failed to factor. EIGHT AIN'T ENOUGH vied for the lead along the inside, but failed to keep pace with an
outer foe into the turn, and subsequently weakened. ALPHALFA vied outside of EIGHT AIN'T ENOUGH while in the three path down the cute, stalked the
pace after another foe bid for the lead at the three quarter pole, but weakened turning for home, and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
KING FURY tracked from midpack four wide, inched forward into the far turn to vie four wide around that bend, dueled outside of a pair of foes through
upper stretch, then forged an advantage at the furlong pole and drew clear in the final sixteenth. RAM stalked the pace three wide, but came under a drive
to hold position between horses at the half mile pole, failed to do so turning for home, then refound stride between foes in the final stages, and surged to
prevail for place. PALAZZI stalked the pace along the inside, chased the leaders turning for home before tipping three wide at the furlong pole to pass tiring
foes, did so, but was outfinished by an outer foe at the wire. MYSTICAL MAN was bothered by a rank inner foe into the first turn, raced off of the pace three
wide around the first turn, advanced in the five path and outside of foes around the far turn, then leveled off through the lane and was outfinished by inner
foes for minor rewards. MAHOMES MONEY set the pace along the inside, dug in to hold an advantage from multiple foes in upper stretch, but was headed
by the winner at the furlong pole, bested approaching the sixteenth pole, tired, and got outfinished by outer foes in the final stages. WINDCRACKER
prompted the pace two wide, vied for the lead around the far turn, then between foes through upper stretch, but was ridden with less than all-out driving
pressure through the final furlong, and got outfinished by outer foes for minor rewards. NOW A JAGUAR awkwardly jumped a stride into the first turn
causing other foes to be bothered, then saved ground off of the pace but failed to menace. ERTUGRUL tracked from midpack in the two path around the
turns, but never got involved. LAST SAMURAI was off slowly, then shied to the five path from an inner foe into the first turn, trailed in the three path around
that bend, and failed to factor. COOL RAGS hopped then shied from a rival at the start, saved ground far off of the pace, and never factored.
PHRASEOLOGISM was bothered by an inner foe into the first turn, raced far off of the pace three wide, but was outrun. REDOUX was off slowly, raced off
of the pace in the two path, and never got involved.

Footnotes
CRAFTY DADDY stalked the pace along the inside before tipping to the three path into the turn, produced a three wide bid for the lead turning for home,
forged an advantage at the quarter pole, but drifted out passing the furlong pole while meeting CAPTIVATING MOON's bid, brushed that foe approaching
the wire causing himself to change leads, then won the photo via a head bob. CAPTIVATING MOON hopped a bit at the start and trailed the field, took the
far turn in the four path before advancing turning for home, but drifted out while producing a bid approaching the furlong pole, straightened dueled outside of
CRAFTY DADDY through the late stages as that foe drifted out as well, then was brushed by that rival approaching the wire, and lost the head bob.
RENAISANCE FROLIC set the pace along the inside, but was headed at the quarter pole, and tired. CULLUM ROAD stalked the pace setter two wide, but
failed to keep pace between horses at the quarter pole, and weakened. Following a Rider's objection lodged by the rider of CAPTIVATING MOON against
the rider of CRAFTY DADDY for interference in deep stretch, the stewards made no change to the original order of finish.

Footnotes
RUBUS lied forwardly placed three wide, inched closer around the turn and produced a three wide bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, forged an
advantage approaching the furlong pole, and drove clear in the late stages. EXPLORER set the pace inside of a pair of foes around the turn, dug in to hold
an advantage in upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong pole and held place. TOUGH LOVE stalked the pace along the inside while in the two path,
shifted outside of CANDY CORNELL to bid for show between horses, and prevailed for that position on the wire. STRAIGHT SHOT tracked from off of the
pace in the three path, split foes while shifting four wide turning for home, produced a rally, but was outfinished by an inner foe for show. MADISON'S LUNA
raced far off of the pace in the two to three path into the turn, shifted to the five path turning for home, but only offered a mild kick and failed to threaten.
CANDY CORNELL pressed the pace two wide and between horses, vied turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leaders at the furlong pole, and
yielded. COMPLEXIFIER was bumped at the start, then failed to factor. RAGTIME BLUES saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. LITTLE KANSAS
was off slowly and trailed the field, then never got involved. LINE JUDGE tracked from midpack four wide, inched forward to striking range turning for home,
but was eased while weakening between horses in upper stretch. SMART TIME tracked from midpack two to three wide between horses, but steadied while
weakening at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
GIRL DADDY broke a step slowly allowing her to avoid trouble at the start, stalked the leading duelers three wide, produced a three wide bid in hand at the
five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage from inner foes at the quarter pole, kicked clear of outer bidding foes while shifting in approaching the three
sixteenths pole, then widened her advantage under vigorous hand urging. CRAZY BEAUTIFUL trailed the field down the backstretch, rallied in hand
between horses around the turn to loom behind a group of foes, remained blocked behind that wall turning for home before splitting horses four to three
wide in upper stretch, was bumped between horses in the process but produced bid for the lead outside of GIRL DADDY, but proved no match for that foe
through the late stages and was second best. ALEXANDRIA was forwardly placed two wide and between horses, waited for racing room behind the leaders
turning for home, aggressively squeezed through a narrow opening between the early leading duelers at the quarter pole, bumped both of those foes in the
process, then chased the clear leader home from the inside. XTREMA tracked four wide and between horses, produced a four wide bid between foes at the
quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with the leader passing the three sixteenths pole. FABRICATE advanced five wide around the turn to produce a bid at
the quarter pole, but flattened out and weakened at the furlong pole. MANIA broke in and bumped INJECT at the start, dueled for the lead outside of that foe
around the turn, but was bumped by ALEXANDRIA at the quarter pole, and was quickly swallowed up between horses. AMERICAN GRACE raced off of the
pace along the inside, trailed the field around the turn before swinging to the six path turning for home, but failed to factor. INJECT was bumped by MANIA
at the start, dueled for the lead inside of that foe down the backstretch and around the turn, but was bumped by ALEXANDRIA while weakening at the
quarter pole. BLISSFUL CHANGE stalked the pace along the inside, but weakened into the turn, was eased through the lane, and jogged across the wire.

Footnotes
IADANZA set the pace along the inside, dug in to hold an advantage from a pair of foes turning for home, responded to mild pressure and recleared
approaching the furlong pole, and was ridden out to the wire while hanging on her left lead. EEL POINT stalked three wide, bid for the lead turning for home,
but was repelled by the leader and proved second best. CAPT. MAESTRI trailed the field along the inside around the turn, then shifted to the four path at
the furlong pole to produce a mild rally on his left lead for show. THE ANGRY MAN stalked two wide, but weakened between horses in upper stretch.
SUSPIROS took the turn in the three to four path while off of the pace, and failed to factor. POPPY'S PRIZE stalked along the inside, but weakened around
the turn.
