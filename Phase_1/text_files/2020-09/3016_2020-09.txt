HIGHESTDISTINCTION was bothered after the start and raced back early on, was off the rail into the lane, altered out in the stretch, split horses, made a
late bid and edged past the leader in the final stages. TEN FLAT was bumped after the start, dueled early on along the inside, stayed on the inside into the
lane, drew clear in the stretch but yielded in the late stages. NINEELEVENTURBO dueled early on two wide, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late
in the stretch run. VEDDER chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane while making a bid but faded late in the stretch drive. MAKE'N
TRACKS was never a threat. GRAVES MILL ROAD was never a factor. ADJUDICATOR was through after a half.

Footnotes
HOUSE LIMIT rallied four wide around the far turn to produce a bid for the lead turning for home, cleared away from inner foes at the three sixteenths pole,
widened while shifting ground, then held after flopping back to his left lead inside the furlong pole. FROST OR FRIPPERY stalked the leading duelers from
the two path, advanced into the far turn while inside of a foe, but was blocked behind the early pace setters in the latter half of that bend, which caused him
to be outmoved by the wider bidding HOUSE LIMIT turning for home, then tipped five wide at the three sixteenths pole as that aforementioned foe kicked
clear, and stayed on to achieve place while not threatening the leader. DARREN'S FORTUNE stalked the leading duelers from the three path, advanced
three wide around the far turn while keeping FROST OR FRIPPERY hemmed in, produced a bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but was no match
from an outer bidding foe in upper stretch, then was outfinished for place. CHARLIE'SARCHANGEL dueled for the lead inside of POPULAR KID into the
backstretch, but took back to stalk approaching the half mile pole, reengaged that foe two wide into the far turn, forged a narrow advantage turning for
home, but was no match for outer foes in upper stretch, and tired. POPULAR KID dueled for the lead two wide, cleared away from his inner foe approaching
the half mile pole, but was headed by that foe and other rivals at the quarter pole, and weakened through the lane. SMIRK saved ground from midpack
around the first turn before taking the far turn in three path, but failed to respond to pressure and was no factor. TRES EQUIS trailed throughout and was
outrun.

Footnotes
STAYIN' OUT LATE set a slow pace in hand along the inside around the turn, shook loose from pressing foes in upper stretch, drew off with ease as the
rider searched for competition, felt a few shoulder taps to the sixteenth pole, and was geared down approaching the wire. COUSIN LARRY was brushed
between horses at the start, tracked from midpack in the two path while in range of the pace, shifted three wide turning for home and produced a bid for
place in upper stretch as the leader kicked away, then chased that foe through the stretch while pulling away from the rest of the field. INSPECTOR FROST
was crowded at the start, but recovered to race close up inside of the pace setter through the early stages, but got keen under a tight hold inside of foes
passing the five furlong pole, settled at the half mile pole, then stalked from the pocket around the turn, but was no match for the leader in upper stretch,
tired, but held show. SAQEEL raced far off of the pace two wide, but failed to threaten the leaders while staying on for a minor reward. FLAGS UP pressed
the pace setter from between horses, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, and weakened. TOWN AGENDA saved ground far off of the
pace, but to no avail. COASTAL WATERS took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace, and was outrun. GO WEST was forwardly placed three
wide, but failed to respond to pressure around the turn, and weakened after being floated four wide turning for home.

Footnotes
SUN SUMMERS tracked from midpack along the inside, advanced under her own power into the far turn to loom from the pocket at the five sixteenths pole,
smoothly tipped three wide turning for home while inside of foes to produce a bid outside of the leaders in upper stretch, then kicked clear at the furlong pole
under driving pressure. CHANNEL PRINCESS stalked along the inside around the first turn, then two wide and outside of SUN SUMMERS around the far
turn, got floated four wide by that foe turning for home, but was outkicked by her and the outer bidding HAT TIP in upper stretch, then kept on to reclaim
place from the latter at the wire. HAT TIP raced off of the pace three wide around both turns, advanced while being fanned five wide turning for home to
produce a bid in upper stretch, but was no match for an inner foe at the furlong pole, flattened out while flopping back to her left lead at the sixteenth pole,
then was nailed by CHANNEL PRINCESS on the wire for place. GRAYSONSMACHO GAL pressed the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, but yielded
to outer horses through midstretch. UNAPOLOGETIC ME saved ground far off of the pace around the turns, shifted out through the lane, but failed to
produce a rally. JEN TAKE CHARGE was brushed between horses at the start, trailed the field two wide around both turns, and failed to factor. LISTEN UP
set the pace along the inside, felt pressure from an outer foe around the far turn before being headed by that foe and other rivals at the quarter pole, and
faltered.

Footnotes
WHAT A COUNTRY stalked two wide, bid for the lead three wide into the far turn before drawing clear under driving pressure at the three sixteenths pole,
then tired a bit through the final sixteenth, but held safely. DON BOURBON steadied into the first turn when COMMUNICATOR shifted inwards without
being clear, caused multiple trailing foes to steady off his heels in the process, then stalked from along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the eventual
winner around the far turn, kept on through the lane, shifted three wide at the furlong pole, and prevailed between horses for place. GLORY ROAD tracked
from midpack in the two to three path around the turns, then offered a late kick in the final furlong outside of a pair of foes while still having many lengths to
find on the leader, but missed place while dead heating for show. SAMARONTI prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead into the far turn inside of
WHAT A COUNTRY, but proved no match for that foe passing the three sixteenths pole, tired through the final furlong, then was nailed on the wire for place
and dead heated for show. STOCK DEAL steadied off heels into the first turn, trailed two to three wide around the turns, and failed to factor. MISTER
CANDY RIDE got rank behind and inside of foes passing the wire for the first time, then steadied off of heels into the first turn, saved ground while racing far
off of the pace around that bend, then two wide around the far turn, but failed to make an impact. COMMUNICATOR cut down into the first turn while forging
an advantage, but was not clear of DON BOURBON, caused that foe and other rivals to steady into the first turn in the process, then set the pace along the
inside down the backstretch before being headed into the far turn, then weakened at the three furlong pole, and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
STARRININMYDREAMS vied two wide early on before clearing his inner counterpart into the turn, held an advantage through upper stretch as MONEY
MILES produced a stiff bid, but repelled that foe passing the furlong pole, and drew off under a vigorous hand ride. MONEY MILES was forwardly placed
two wide and between horses into the turn, inched closer turning for home to bid for the lead three wide in upper stretch, but was repelled by the inner pace
setter at the furlong pole, and was second best. HIDDEN STASH tracked from midpack three wide and between horses into the turn, then stayed on mildly
through the lane while hanging on his left lead. MAZZINI shied a bit from an outer foe at the start and was aggressively taken up by the rider, trailed the field
two wide into the turn before splitting foes turning for home, then shifted four wide in midstretch and rallied for a minor reward. TAP GOLD bumped with an
outer foe at the start, stalked three wide before bidding two wide into the turn, but failed to keep pace between horses in upper stretch. BIRTHDAY PARTY
was off slowly, saved ground far off of the pace around the turn, then passed tired foes through the lane. HOPE AND DIGNITY vied along the inside, took
back to stalk into the turn, but steadily faded thereafter. GENERATOR tracked from midpack four wide, but failed to factor before weakening through the
lane. SPEITFUL SAM stalked along the inside early on, but was outmoved by outer foes into the turn, shifted to the five path while far off of the pace turning
for home, but further faded through the lane. CRUMP bumped with an inner foe at the start, saved ground around the turn while far off of the pace, but was
outrun.
