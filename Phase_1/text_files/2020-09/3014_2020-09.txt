DINGDINGDINGDING raced behind foes early, angled to the outside of the field nearing the turn, ranged up in the three path and led clear by the eighth
pole, drawing off. RUSHED chased from inside, dropped back on the turn, made a steady gain down the stretch and just got the place at the wire. LUCKY
FELLOW was bumped at the start, tracked outside of two foes, briefly fought the winner in upper stretch but was no match and yielded at the wire to another
foe for second, settlng for show as a result. BIG AL chased form between horses early, lost position and ran evenly in the final furlong. STERLING
GENERAL was bumped at the start, hard sent to the lead, and faded in the final furlong.

SAY IT AIN'T SO pressed outside the leader to the lane and was confidently ridden in late stretch to edge away for the win. TREETOP FLYER showed
speed at the rail, fought the winner in the stretch but yielded in the final furlong. SMOLTZ stalked from a good spot just behind the leaders, was urged closer
in the five path on the turn but needed more down the stretch. STATESBORO was bumped by a foe shortly after the start, raced unhurried to the turn,
picked up the pace and gained inside down the stretch despite the rider losing the whip at the 1/4 pole. DANZO drifted in and bumped a foe shortly after the
start, was last and no threat. PER OHIO STATE RACING COMMISSION RULING #2020-044, DATED 11/03/2020 SAY IT AIN'T SO WAS DQ'D DUE TO A

Footnotes
DISCREET KITTY showed to the front inside and stayed on in a willing finish. ETELKA raced mid pack, dropped back a bit on the far turn, closed best down
the lane but was too late to get past the winner. ANGEL OF VERDUN was up close throughout and lost place to a closer late. MAGIC FINNISH bounced
between foes entering the first turn, loomed in upper stretch but leveled out at the eighth pole. SWEEPENO was well back early, floated out by a foe on the
backstretch, came wide into the stretch and improved position. B SKY HIGH was well back and had some late pace. WHATAROCKET took the four path in
the first turn, chased from the rail on the backstretch, was pushed along on the turn and threatened before faltering in the final furlong. GOING TO TEMPLE
drifted out on the backstretch and also in the stretch. SO LONG DIXIE was bumped at the start and posed no threat. SING ME SWEET was bumped at the
start, chased inside to the turn and stopped.

needed. RUN BUBBA RUN off slow, stayed inside, missed trouble early on and raced on evenly. WHAT A RUMOR caught in tight early on, checked back
with no run thereafter. ROCK STAR LADY never in contention while all out to turn from inside. MYMONSTERSFORREAL close up early on, dropped back
into the stretch. MARCH MAGIC off slow, rushed in a drive outside but came up empty from the turn.

Footnotes
BLONDE BY NATURE off slow in hand, rallied widest out of the turn and rallied nicely to run past leaders as much the best. DUNWOODY good position to
the turn, ran on in the stretch while while no match for the winner and clearly best of the rest. FLAT OUT APPEALING good speed outside to vie into stretch,
cleared, run down late. WATERLOO SUNSET speed to the lead, collared in the stretch, faltered in the drive. WANTA SHOT close to lead for a half, gave
way readily in the stretch run. HOT FRANCESCA broke smooth from outside, never a menace. BOO HAWK terrible start, dropped far back in the stretch.
WHISKEY SIS off slow from inside, never a factor. MORNING CHILD never a factor.
