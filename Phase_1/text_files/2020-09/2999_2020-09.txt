Footnotes
ODD GAL set the pace in the two path, kicked clear nearing the lane and widened under a drive. ATHENASWAY raced up close inside, could not keep pace
with the winner nearing the lane but finished willingly to be clearly second best. CHARITY STRIPE pressed the pace in the three path, weakened in the lane
and lasted for the show. SWEET HOME DIXIE raced off the pace two and three wide between foes and had a mild rally inside to just miss third. LUNA
never threatened while racing four wide. BLUE SUADE GUITAR stalked the pace three wide in the four path, bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole and tired in
the lane. DUDE'S SECRET trailed two wide.

CULTURAL MANDATE set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch, held clear past the sixteenth pole and just lasted. OLIVE KAT raced off the
pace two wide, angled five wide entering the lane, surged late and just missed. POLISHED GAL raced well back three wide, came six wide into the lane and
rallied widest. JERSEY LIFE saved ground in range and lacked a rally. FRAN'S SALSA saved ground and never threatened. R U HAPPY NOW tracked the
pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. KUPURI threw her head at the start, raced well back two wide, made some progress in upper stretch, steadied off
heels near the sixteenth pole and was not encouraged from there. PRIME LIME pressed the winner two wide and weakened in the lane.

out through the final furlong. WHERE YA GOIN OWEN came out and bumped a foe just after the start, stalked the pace inside, tipped out in upper stretch,
was no match for the winner but held on for the place. SMART WARRIOR lacked early speed while racing four wide between rivals, advanced three wide
around the far turn and was along for the show. I SAY I PLAY stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. PURRS AGAIN was bumped just
after the start, chased the pace two wide and tired nearing the lane. EXCHANGE FEVER played no factor while racing three and four wide. HIGH

FINAL PROSPECT settled off the duel while racing two wide, made good progress around the far turn, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths pole,
seized command near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. BOBBY G trailed inside for six furlongs, swung four wide near the quarter pole and rallied
widest to be clearly second best. SACRAMENTO Q settled off the duel along the rail and just inside of the winner, advanced along with that rival while
ridden along around the far turn, angled out to bid three wide between foes nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch
and weakened. TIZ SAMURAI dueled outside of RED AGAIN for six furlongs and tired. RED AGAIN dueled inside in the two path and retreated nearing the
lane.

Footnotes
TROUBLE COFFEE set a clear pace inside, drifted out under right-handed urging in upper stretch, straightened out soon after and widened while ridden out
through the final three-sixteenths. MONSTER MASON settled two wide in midpack, made progress inside around the far turn and finished willingly to gain
the place. MAGIC WIZARD was bumped early, raced off the pace four wide around the first turn, moved up two wide around the far turn and was along for
the show. PRATT tracked the pace from the rail and came up empty in the lane. OPTICAL ILLUSION saved ground to no avail. ABDAA chased the pace
three wide and came up empty in the lane. FORTYEIGHTSTRAIGHT stalked the winner two wide and faded in the lane. MAKEANENTRANCE was in tight
at the start, raced four and five wide and never threatened. GOOFY BOY chased the pace four wide and tired. WON THE BYNG saved ground in midpack,
steadied midway around the first turn and made little impact. PROPER HUMOR veered out at the start, bumped a foe several strides later, was erratic
throughout and never reached contention. DRILL BIT was unruly in the paddock, broke slowly, raced off the pace three wide between foes, checked late of
the first turn and made little impact.
