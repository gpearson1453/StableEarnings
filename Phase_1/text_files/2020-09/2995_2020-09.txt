BE A LOVELY DAY vied outside a foe, led early in the turn, responded to a challenge in upper stretch and held sway. G CODE broke sharp, stayed off the
lead early, chased in the four path on the turn, could not match strides with the winner late but was game for second. PRESI PLAIN JANE raced off the
pace, took the five path on the turn, was erratic in the stretch and ran on for show. ONE LAST CAT was floated out by a foe at the start, stayed well back
and improved position in the stretch. UNBRIDLED'S GIRL vied inside the winner, bumped and checked nearing the turn and backed off after that. LISNET
veered out and bothered a foe at the start and raced up the rail in the stretch while no threat.

KYLIES CHARM ranged up to vie for the lead on the turn in the three path, led and angled in to the rail in upper stretch and widened from there. PLATINUM
GALE raced mid pack to the turn, moved up under mild urging, was roused at the top of the stretch and gained steady ground to get up late for second.
HONOR BAR bumped a foe at the start, was unhurried to the stretch and made a steady run for show. HOWIZEE bumped a horse at the start, tracked from
second early, was briefly between horses entering the turn, drifted out in the stretch and lost position. HOOSIER GOLD CASE was up close, a bit rank
entering the turn, floated out twice and bumped down the stretch. RUNNINFROMTHELAW took a reserved lead and faltered in the final furlong.
SANCTUAIRE SPOT tracked inside and dropped back on the turn.

ALLABOUTAPRINCESS tardy from gate gate, stayed on rail to the turn, angled out for the drive and was all out to prevail. DEVILS DAUGHTER vied from
inside to stretch, went all out to the wire but was,outfinished. MY TEMPLE tracked leaders from inside, loomed boldly at the eighth pole and gamely held the
show spot. HELGA SHMELGA good speed, let foe up rail to duel through the stretch and came up, empty late. DUCHES OF GRACE unhurried to turn,
swung wide to finish willingly in the stretch run. PRINCESS AVRIL vied three wide to deep stretch, put a head in front at the eighth pole but had nothing left
and backed up. TRACK MAGIC broke slow, never reached contention while inside throughout. TZIPI never threatened. SPOOFY DOO outrun.

SEVENTY SEVENTYCAT was at the rear early, responded to urging on the turn, moved up in the five path, wore down foes in the stretch and had the best
late run of all. ACCOUSTICAL ranged up to lead on the turn and ran on, only yielding in deep stretch to settle for place. DRAGSTER was restrained with
speed early inside, backed off a bit, stayed close and was fully extended late to hold show. BARRY'S SWING bumped a horse at the start, angled out for
room on the backstretch, chased the leader around the turn and on into the stretch before flattening out to lose position late. HIGH RISK STRATEGY
bumped a foe at the start, raced inside at the rear early, rallied in the six path on the far turn and improved position in the stretch. SEVENTYSEVENWILOW
was restrained on the lead and dropped back on the turn.

paced late. ONE FOR RICHIE pressed the winner most of the way and hung late. CAPTURE THE GLORY chased inside, was asked on the turn and
managed enough run late to get the show. EVENT DRIVEN bumped a foe at the start, stayed back and chased up the rail in the lane to improve position.
ACOSTA pressed outside two foes, raced in the five path into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. IMPROBABLE STORY was up close to the turn
but needed rally. MY GOOD GIRL ran mid pack from off the rail to the turn and backed up.

Footnotes
WICKED WEDNESDAY was bothered between horses at the start, raced well off the pace in a strung out field, was urged a bit into the turn and readily
moved closer, rallied to split horses at the top of the stretch, got clear by the eighth pole and won as best today. AMIGO MIKE prompted the lead, chased
the winner down the stretch and ended up second best. MR SUPERB tracked from third and held position throughout. CHEROKEE HAWK raced off the
pace, moved out for room on the backstretch and improved position in the lane. REAGANIZE was inside and up close to the turn and faded. KENTUCKY
SKY showed speed inside to the stretch and flattened out at the rail. DIAMOND DREAMER was far back and no threat. SIR NUISANCE stumbled badly and
was wide in the stretch.

READY SET GO raced four wide to the turn, rallied four wide past the three sixteenth pole and pulled away slowly to the wire under heavy pressure.. MISS
CELESTE slow from gate, had an inside trip to the turn, angled out for clear run but was outfinished.to the wire. FLEETWOOD GRADUATE unhurried
between horses to the turn, raced five wide mildly in the late going for the show spot. AFLAXENDREAM was off slow, no speed to the stretch, floated widest
to make up a bit of ground in the final furlong. MERRIE GOGO battled on front end to quarter pole but faltered in the drive. PAIG'S SONG was off slow and
never a factor. SHES MIGHTY FINE dueled from inside to turn and gave way readily from that point. ATLANTIS ROSE never a factor. EXPLODING LUCY
flashed brief foot to the turn, swallowed up approaching the quarter pole and dropped back from there.
