Footnotes
LUCKY RAMSEY lacked speed outside horses, raced five wide the far turn, floated to the six path at the head of the stretch, closed outside horses, led late
and drove clear. OLD DOMINION stalked the pace two wide, challenged for the lead inside the eighth pole and finished gamely. KISS MY NOTE , steadied
in close quarters entering the first turn, saved ground on the turns, angled out in upper stretch, worked between horses and rallied late. JO'S BOLD CAT
lacked speed, swung to the six path turning for home and showed a late move outside rivals. CAN HE SHINE set the pace along the rail and weakened in
the late stages. HARD FOUGHT hugged the rail stalking the pace, steadied into the far turn, had aim on the leader in mid stretch and flattened out.
CLEVER TRIAD , squeezed back leaving the starting gate, steadied in traffic approaching the first turn and was outrun. SOULMATE gave way. ATREYU ,
four deep the first turn, was five wide leaving the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
INDIAN GHOST settled off the pace while saving some ground, eased out leaving the far turn, rallied four wide between rivals and challenged in mid stretch,
gained a slim lead between foes leaving the sixteenth marker and prevailed under left handed asking. GLENGAR , fractious behind the gate, was taken to
rate off the pace, moved up three wide past the three eighths marker, bid between runners in mid stretch, fought on gamely to the inside of a pair of rivals
and dug in for the place. CAMPARI lagged off the pace, took closer order between runners past the five sixteenths, angled out and circled five wide into the
lane, ranged up to take command with a furlong remaining, dueled outside foes and hung. LUCID DREAM , off the pace while saving ground, was briefly
stalled around the far turn, was under pressure pursuing into the lane, eased out and had a belated response. ONCE MORE EH , a bit rank off the heels of
BATTLE READY leaving the seven eighths, recovered and was taken to rate, steadily closed in on the leader after six furlongs, drew alongside and dueled
on a slim lead past the three sixteenths, ceded command soon after and faded late. BATTLE READY dropped in and tightened things for rivals when
heading to command near the first turn, opened up and set a brisk pace towards the rail, was taken on leaving the five sixteenths, dueled in upper stretch
then surrendered through the final furlong. BEST OFFER had speed three deep then checked off the heels of BATTLE READY nearing the first turn,
regrouped to race wide, failed to make an impact and weakened around the final turn.

Footnotes
TICKER TAPE PARADE edged up inside then took up sharply when keen to go behind the leader heading towards the half mile pole, recovered to track
along the rail, got through inside in upper stretch, kicked clear a furlong out and held firm under a drive. TRICKY LION stalked two to three wide, was under
asking mid turn, bid to threaten outside rivals in upper stretch, kept on gamely and was clear for the place. SIDEWALK PROPHET , a bit rank out of the
gate, hopped shortly thereafter, regrouped and pursued in the clear mid turn, edged up behind foes past the eighth pole, shifted out and churned on. THE
FORTY FACTOR sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, began to drift out near the quarter pole, corrected into the lane, stayed willingly to about
mid stretch then faded. TEAM TIM broke a step slow, was taken well wide after about a furlong and failed to menace. SWING STEP , four to five wide early
on, dropped back around the turn. TALENT SCOUT saved ground off the pace, sustained an injury in upper stretch then was euthanized on the track. There
was a stewards' inquiry but no action was taken.

Footnotes
MINISTER'S STRIKE lacked speed, well off the pace, swung to the five path in upper stretch, advanced outside horses, swept to command inside the
eighth pole and drew off while hand ridden through the lane. GOLDEN SPEAR stalked the pace, advanced three wide on the far turn, gained the lead near
the eighth pole and lacked the needed late effort. EARNED IT saved ground to the far turn, raced in the two path approaching the stretch, worked between
horses, rallied and drifted out late. BARIN , taken to the six path in upper stretch, showed a mild gain outside horses. RULE YOURSELF , three wide the
first turn, was four deep leaving the far turn and failed to rally. ELDRITCH (IRE) chased the pace, raced two wide the far turn and gave way the final furlong.
POSTERITY , unhurried early, was not a factor. APPROVETHISMESSAGE set the pace near the rail and gave way. NO KNOCK RAID , a forward factor
along the inner rail, steadied entering the far turn and faltered in the drive. ACROSS THE AISLE , unhurried early, was outrun.

WHISKEY AND RYE sprinted clear early, dictated the pace towards the rail, opened up after being roused in upper stretch, was under a strong drive to the
sixteenth pole then cruised home late. CLOSERTOTHEHEART stalked the winner two to three wide, was under pressure past the five sixteenths and kept
on willingly to the wire. UNION TATTERS edged up early along the inside and rated in range, saw the leaders get away around the turn, eased out for the
drive and churned on. OUT OF SORTS , off slowly when a bit flat footed, swung four wide for the drive and finished with decent energy. LOOKIN BACK
stalked inside, was under pressure past the five sixteenths and faded. KUBIE SNACKS was forced out a bit and steadied at the break, regrouped and saved
ground well off the pace, checked sharply when put in tight entering the turn, recovered and remained inside, found room through the lane, finished strong
and kept on well through the gallop out. SALAMINA , three to four wide pursuing the pace, faded. DANGER ZONE , unruly when being saddled on the track,
came out at the break, was shuffled back some near the five eighths and failed to recover. HONORGETIC , fractious pre race, stalked the pace three wide
outside a rival, failed to keep pace past the five sixteenths and gave way. MYSTIQUE PALACE , off the pace three wide, raced greenly in the lane.

Footnotes
GRATEFUL BRED , unruly behind the starting gate, accelerated to the early lead, angled in midway down the backstretch, set the pace near the rail and
drew out through the stretch. HE'S ONE WILD DUDE saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and rallied. RAILMASTER ,
two wide around the turn, chased the winner and finished willingly. SEA LOVER bore out leaving the starting gate, chased the pace three deep around the
turn, moved up to the eighth pole then weakened. BATTLEBUS , four deep on the turn, was not a menace. FLY THE W , steadied when bumped by SEA
LOVER soon after the break, raced in the three path between horses on the turn and failed to be a factor. PADRINO'S HEART , outrun, swung to the six
path in upper stretch and failed to rally. XMASINTHECITY hugged the inner rail around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
OVERPOWER settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out and was put to pressure leaving the three eighths, circled five wide into the lane, rallied
past the dueling leaders leaving the furlong grounds, kicked clear under a drive then was taken in hand late. SHERIFF CHIP was hustled up between rivals
soon after the break, bid two wide to command into the backstretch, set the pace slightly off the inside, was joined into the far turn, got in an extended duel
with ELUSIVE MOTION, held a slim advantage in mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. FIND YOUR BOAZ , four wide the first turn, edged
up to prompt outside rivals, moved in to be a threat between foes leaving mid stretch then kept on with interest to the line. ELUSIVE MOTION drifted out
nearing the first turn, dropped in and rushed up between runners to threaten after a half mile, dueled and gained short lead past the three eighths, kept up
the battle past mid stretch then weakened. THREE CHOPT PUNCH sped clear early then rated back conceding the lead to SHERRIFF CHIP, stayed inside
to stalk, eased out in upper stretch, moved up then steadied in close between rivals in mid stretch then came up empty. KING PACAY , rank between
runners early, chased and came up empty. GALACTIC SLAM , off slow then bearing out, was outrun. RECKLESS LIFE lost ground five wide, faltered and
was eased. Objections against ELUSIVE MOTION and FIND YOUR BOAZ by the rider of THREE CHOPT ROAD for alleged interference in the stretch were
not allowed.
