Footnotes
RICH E Z chased inside horses through the first turn, edged to closer order past the three quarters, was switched three wide past the seven sixteenths and
pushed for a bid, took the lead three wide past the five sixteenths, took over into the lane and gradually increased his advantage under a drive. ORCUS
stalked just outside of FORT RAMSEY, encroached into the second turn, headed him at the five sixteenths but was almost immediately passed by RICH E Z
to his outside, was outkicked into the lane by FORT RAMSEY while both were no match for RICH E Z, but kept on well enough under a drive to get up for
place late. FORT RAMSEY was reluctant to load, went keenly to the lead, set an uncontested pace through the clubhouse turn and the backstretch run, took
pressure from ORCUS to his outside into the second turn, was headed by that foe at the five sixteenths, got past that foe again inside into the lane though
was no match for RICH E Z, kept on under a drive inside but lost the place late. PISTOL BOX chased the leading pair, was pushed along in the two to three
path around the second turn, and kept on evenly under a drive in the lane. ALPHA BOY raced two wide at the rear of the main group through the first turn,
was pushed along from the nine sixteenths, came into the far turn three wide, was driven three wide around the bend but made no rally. SWITHERAL
settled well behind the field, continued as no factor in the three path on the far turn, and was allowed to trail home.

WILLOW MOON sprinted to the front leaving the gate, showed the way throughout, saved ground around the turn and was never truly threatened. JUJU'S
SPECIALGIRL chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path approaching the half mile pole, and couldn't get by the
winner while drifting out in late stretch. HONEY MUG hit the gate at the break, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two and three
path around the turn, began a bid near the three sixteenths pole and gained some ground on the outside in late stretch. WINNING QUALITY trailed the field
on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and improved position mildly in the stretch but was outkicked late. ANGEL ALESSANDRA chased the
leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LOVE YOUR BUTTONS chased between horses four wide down the mile chute, continued midpack inside of ANDREAS after DIAMOND DAVE settled
back past the three quarters, chased the leading flight in the two path on the turn, swung out and was driven three wide in upper stretch, rallied, took the
lead past TETSU and TALKING ZIP at the sixteenth, and held four wide. MALIGATOR settled at the rear early, was pushed along in the three to four path
on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, found his best five wide in the final furlong and missed. DIAMOND DAVE chased near the rear inside early,
settled further back inside of MALIGATOR past the three quarters, raced patiently while saving ground through the turn, improved position inside into the
lane, sustained his inside rally and got up late for the show. TETSU tracked the leading pair down the back straight, engaged outside of TALKING ZIP into
the turn, vied outside of TALKING ZIP into the lane, had no answer for LOVE YOUR BUTTONS or MALIGATOR in the final sixteenth and was nailed late for
the show. TALKING ZIP cleared to the lead, was engaged by TETSU and ANDREAS outside him into the turn, continued to vie inside of TETSU all the way
down the lane, was no match for the top two in the final sixteenth, and narrowly outfinished between horses for show. ANDREAS chased three wide down
the chute and two wide down the main backstretch, bid three wide into the turn, began to weaken from the five sixteenths, was driven three wide into the
lane and proved empty. MIDNIGHT JOKER was keen to track the leader early, began to back up from the five eighths, continued to fade in the two to three
path on the turn, had no response under a drive into upper stretch, and was not persevered with in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BEST YOU EVER SEEN tracked the leader from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to race in the two path around the far
turn, moved up to challenge passing the quarter pole and pulled clear while drifting out some in the stretch. BOURBON TAN led the field from the two path
around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, was caught in upper stretch but ran on well to hold the place. THE FIRST
HERO saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the second turn and made a mild gain of
ground in the stretch, just missing the place. IHADADREAM saved ground around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack between horses up the
backstretch, began a bid on the rail near the three eighths pole and improved position mildly in the stretch. MESSED UP saved ground around the first turn,
raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path, made a mild bid passing the quarter pole and flattened out in
the final furlong. TURFMEISTER raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the outside, saved ground
around the far turn and made no bid. GREENSPAN hopped up and was steadied leaving the gate, trailed the field on the rail through the opening half mile,
began to improve position from the two path around the far turn but was never a threat. DARK WOOD (IRE) raced in the two path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch off the pace, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and was not a factor from there.

Footnotes
FOREVERNOA cleared easily, saved ground through the first turn, continued on an uncontested lead down the back straight and in the two path on the far
turn, and held well clear under only intermittent use of the crop. BEACH BAR tracked the leading pair early, took closer order three wide from the half, joined
three wide outside of HOT PEPPER SUZIE and GOINGTOAGOGO for the far turn run, came in at the five sixteenths and bumped HOT PEPPER SUZIE
soundly, loomed outside of FOREVERNOA under a drive into the lane, proved no match, and chased near the center of the track all the way to the wire.
GOINGTOAGOGO settled near the rear, advanced up the inside into the backstretch to chase inside of PEEK A BOO I SEE U on the backstretch, improved
further to join inside of BEACH BAR near the half, raced into the turn at the inside of the tracking flight, was bumped by HOT PEPPER SUZIE at the five
sixteenths as a result of BEACH BAR coming in, chased inside down the lane but proved no match for the top pair. BIRD KEY settled at the rear early,
continued toward the rear down the back straight, was pushed along to take closer order in the four path past the five sixteenths, was driven three wide
through the rest of the turn and four wide into the lane, and kept on mildly in the lane. PEEK A BOO I SEE U tracked the leading pair outside of BEACH
BAR through the first turn, chased outside of GOINGTOAGOGO into the backstretch, was pushed along into the second turn while beginning to lose
ground, raced in the two path around that bend, came into the lane under a drive inside foes, and lacked the needed rally. HOT PEPPER SUZIE broke
outward, tracked off the leader, was joined by GOINGTOAGOGO inside her and BEACH BAR outside her into the far turn, was bumped soundly when
BEACH BAR came in on her near the five sixteenth, weakened between horses into the lane and was empty for the drive. BRILLIANT PATINA settled two
wide near the rear early, was pushed along while trailing in the four path on the turn, and had no response under a drive in the lane. THE RIDER OF
GOINGTOAGOGO CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF BEACH BAR FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE FAR TURN. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY. UPON REVIEW, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED BEACH BAR FROM SECOND TO SIXTH FOR INTERFERING WITH BOTH
GOINGTOAGOGO AND HOT PEPPER SUZIE ON THE FAR TURN.

Footnotes
AGI'S CAIT led the field from the two path around the first turn, continued to show the way while fighting her rider slightly up the backstretch, navigated the
far turn from the two path and dug in in the final furlong to gamely hold off a late challenger. OH SO TERRIBLE brushed with the horse to her outside
leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, raced inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail near the three eighths pole and hung the
length of the stretch, unable to get past the winner and missing by a neck. RUSSIAN MAFIA brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, trailed the
field while saving ground through the next half mile, and improved position while drifting out in the stretch. KUORA (PER) raced in the two path around the
first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid nearing the half mile pole, navigated the far turn from the two
path and flattened out in the stretch. CARISSA CRISMAS raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
came around the far turn in the three path and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
EASTER MUSIC chased inside of GREELEYS ICE early, continued midpack in the two path on the turn, took closer order inside into the stretch just behind
GREY MASK, responded when asked to slip between that foe and the rail near the three sixteenths, and drew clear in the final furlong. WILLOW RIDGE
pressed the pace between horses, was pushed along between horses on the turn while still pressing outside of GREY MASK, was driven three wide from
the three sixteenths as EASTER MUSIC got through, could not match that foe into the final furlong, but kept on second best. GREY MASK was sent for
pace inside, edged clear while keen into the turn, set a pressured pace in the two path on the turn, carried a slim lead into the lane, was headed near the
three sixteenths as EASTER MUSIC slipped through to his inside, and outfinished for the place. CAMPIONI raced well off the inside in last early, continued
in the rear pair in the five path on the turn, swung out for the stretch run, found his best in the final furlong near the center of the course and passed tiring
horses. KNOCKYOURBLOCKOFF prompted the pace three wide until the turn for home but was outpaced by the leaders from upper stretch. GREELEYS
ICE chased two wide, bid four wide approaching the quarter, came into the lane under a drive still four wide, but proved no match for the leaders into the
lane and flattened out. CLUB SODA chased toward the rear early, continued in the three to four path on the turn, came into the lane in the two to three path
in range behind the leading line into the lane, but failed to kick on in the lane. DANCIN NICKY settled in second last well off the inside early, raced in the
four path in the rear pair on the turn, proved empty in the drive and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
DOM CAETANO (ARG) raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, navigated the far turn from the two path,
swung wide into the stretch, began a bid near the eighth pole and gained ground quickly on the outside, to get up in time. HUEY ATTACK raced in the two
path around the first turn, stalked the leaders up the backstretch on the outside, began a move from the three path around the turn, took over in upper
stretch and was caught late. PHARAOH'S KITTEN stumbled slightly leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, stalked the leader on the inside up
the backstretch, raced between horses headed into the far turn and improved position in the stretch. CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN raced in the two path around
the first turn, led the field between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and gave way late. OFF TO THE BEACH came around
the first turn in the two path, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far turn from the two path and gained some
ground in late stretch. A SHEEN CAT raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside headed into the backstretch, came
around the far turn in the two path and weakened in the stretch. RECKLESSNESS saved ground around the first bend, pressed the pace on the inside up
the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch. HIGH SPIRITS hit the gate and was away slowly, trailed the field from
the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, improved position some around the turn and in the stretch, but was never a factor. ROYAL
TRUMPET hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, came up the backstretch at the back of the pack, raced in the four path
around the far turn and made no bid.

Footnotes
GIVIN UP NONE hounded outside the pacesetter early while racing between horses, took the lead outside of BOBBIE TOO TOO at the three eighths,
opened up into the lane, and held while kept to the task. DRIVER DAN raced between horses in the chasing flight early, kept the leading line in his sights in
the two path on the turn, swung into the stretch four wide under a drive, responded with good interest, could not get to the winner but was gaining on him
late. LASTFORTINOFAMILY settled toward the rear, was pushed along two wide on the turn, floated into the stretch in the six path while driven, and rallied
outside horses to prove best of the rest. BEE HAPPY ATTACK hit the gate and came away slowly, settled at the rear, began to improve near the three
eighths while saving ground, turned for home in the two path, floated out in upper stretch and bumped ROCKET RIDE, dropped back inside, and made mild
inside improvement. SILVER HIT raced at the inside of the chasing flight early, was driven while saving ground past the three eighths, and lacked the
needed kick in the lane. ROCKET RIDE chased toward the rear, was pushed in the two to three path on the turn, floated into the stretch in the five path
between horses, was bumped in upper stretch when BEE HAPPY ATTACK came out, and had no rally three wide. BERACUDA HEART raced three wide in
the chasing flight, was hard urged three wide on the turn and driven four wide into the lane, and came up empty. IRISH LIGHTED ROAD attended the pace
three wide down the backstretch and through the turn, was driven three wide into the lane but could not keep up with GIVIN UP NONE and DRIVER DAN,
and faded in the final furlong. BOBBIE TOO TOO veered inward in the opening strides, was hustled to set the pace inside, dictated pressured terms until
being headed at the three eighths, continued close up behind GIVIN UP NONE to the quarter, and emptied out.
