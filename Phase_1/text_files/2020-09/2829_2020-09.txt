Footnotes
HERE'S HANNAH away alertly and raced to the lead one out from the rail upon entering the lane the first time, dictated the pace through the second turn
and in the run down the backstretch, maintained her advantage while racing out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished determinedly to hold
SUNBURST safely at bay late to prevail. SUNBURST stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, set sail after the
pacesetter three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to just miss, while proving easily second best. SOLARITY broke
sharply and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the rail entering the first turn, and finished one
out from the rail in the drive. WARRIOR'S PROMISE dropped back to trail the field while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time,
continued to save ground throughout, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.

WE B THREE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the turn, repelled a bid by UNCHARACTERISTIC leaving the turn, and finished
two wide in the lane to prevail. UNCHARACTERISTIC away well and chased the leader into the turn while saving ground at the rail, loomed a danger
entering the lane, and finished willingly from along the rail in the lane to prove clearly second best. WE'RE IN COMMAND chased from along the inside
entering the turn, and closed steadily from along the rail in the drive to get up for a share. SING OUT LOUD broke sharply and chased the leader one out
from the rail entering the turn, battled two wide through the turn, but was outfinished in the lane while racing one out from the rail. PARKER POINT chased
the leaders into the turn while saving ground at the rail, and finished from along the rail in the drive while unable to improve his position.
HUMBOLDTSTRONG chased two wide into the turn while devoid of early speed , and finished two out from the rail in the drive in an even effort. DIVALDO
was slow into stride, and trailed the field early, was always well back and never a factor.

Footnotes
SWORD FIGHTER settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, assumed command in mid
stretch and quickly drew clear under confident handling. TWISTGRIPS settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch,
rallied smartly five wide entering the final turn, and closed three out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place. CRACKDOWN away alertly and vied for
the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside, assumed command entering the
final turn, and battled gamely through the lane but was outfinished late. RING OF KERRY tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from
the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive. MOLESLEY broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out
from the rail entering the backstretch, chased the leader two wide into the final turn, but was outfinished late. THE ODDS R GOOD away well and pressed
the pace three wide entering the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but faded in the stretch drive. CHOREOGRAPHY stalked
the leaders one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly three wide in the drive. HONK tracked
the leaders from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but weakened in the late stages. SANTA FE
TRAIL settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, was always well back and failed to make a late impact.

Footnotes
AVE'S IN COMMAND away well and pressed the leader one out from the rail entering the backstretch, assumed control and opened a clear advantage into
the final turn, and was never threatened late under confident handling. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER stumbled at the start, but recovered quickly and tracked
the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, and closed one out from the rail in the drive
to hold the place. JUST MAKE BELIEVE tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn,
and closed willingly two out from the rail in the drive to just miss the place. MY GRAND VALENTINE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three
wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly two out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. HARDENED HEART settled well off the early while
saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the stretch drive.
SCULPTED away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backside, was unable to match strides with the winner approaching the final turn, and faded over the final furlong. UPTOWN FUNKY CAT broke sharply and
tracked the leaders into the backstretch while being hung five wide, continued with a five wide trip into the final turn, and lacked the needed closing
response when called upon.
