Footnotes
ROSIEJEWEL DANCER showed speed and set the pace, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. C
J'S FLAIR stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but with a bid at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. HILLTOP HARMONY
tracked the early leaders and was roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. TRULY HONOURED received an unfair
start and was refunded. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START RESULTED IN TRULY HONOURED BEING REFUNDED DO TO AN UNFAIR
START.

Footnotes
IT'SNICETOBENICE was unhurried early, gained ground on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. REBEL
LIONESS was in range and had a good position on the far turn but from the four path through the stretch was outgunned. ORPHAN QUEEN set the pace,
had a clear lead on the far turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. BENADETTE'S LADY was in touch, a factor on the far turn and had
the lead from the three path in mid stretch but failed to hold. I MISS YOU was in mid pack and raced evenly from the inside on the far turn but needed more.
WRITTEN stalked the early leader but chased on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. MEET YOU AT HOME showed
no speed and saved ground on the far turn but was never in contention. CLASSY SCARLETT was well back and showed nothing in a dull effort. A CLAIM
OF FOUL BY THE TRAINER OF BENADETTE'S LADY AGAINST IT'SNICETOBENICE, REBEL LIONESS AND ORPHAN QUEEN FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

HANDSOME GUY was hustled early, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. GUNZIG STINGER was off
slow, hustled along on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was second best. WESTERN SOCIETY was in touch and roused on the turn
but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. STONEAWAY was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path through the
stretch leveled off. SPARKISH showed speed from the inside but chased on the turn and had nothing left. MI CHIAMO STEFANO forced the pace and was
a factor on the turn but weakened through the stretch. BEAR CUB was up close early but checked into the turn, outdistanced and walked off. A CLAIM OF
FOUL BY THE RIDER ON BEAR CUB AGAINST HANDSOME GUY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE GOING INTO THE TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

WATER POLO was in range, moved up on the turn and with a bid from the five path in mid stretch drew clear. BIG BAND BENNY was away alertly, had the
lead on the turn and was second best in a good effort. COLLEEN'S SAILOR was in mid pack, raced evenly from the inside on the turn, angled outside in
upper stretch and finished well. OPTIC was hustled early and forced the pace on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was all out.
STATION ROCK was well back and saved ground on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. MIDNITE SNACKATTAK was in
touch but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch faded. VICTOR'S WAY was off the pace and roused on the turn but from the
seven path at the top of the stretch failed to fire.

from the four path in mid stretch was outgunned. BUTTERFLY STRIKE set the pace, had the lead on the far turn and vied through the stretch in a good
effort. CENAR was off the pace, had a mild gain on the far turn and from the five path through the stretch rallied late. ROCKBARTON stalked the early
leader and forced the pace on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. GHOST ISLAND was in touch early but lost

Footnotes
TWIRLING WIND was hustled early, had the lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. LIGHT OF CONGRATS was
unhurried early, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was second best. SAVOIA was away alertly, roused from between foes
on the turn and held show. MISS TEA BLONDE was in touch and a factor from the inside on the turn but evened out. MY FINAL TRICK was in range, saved
ground on the turn and angled outside in upper stretch but needed more. NONIOBUSINESS hopped at the start, trailed throughout and had no impact.

Footnotes
BRADY O'BRADY was off the pace, gained ground on the turn and with a bid at the top of the stretch proved best. SUMMER RETREAT set a pressured
pace and had a slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was all out. CAPTAIN SIDNEY was in range and had a good position
on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch evened out. MARRIAGE COUNSELOR was unhurried early and hustled along on the turn but from
the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. STORMY LEO was in range and a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had
no late kick. R DANCE HALL was off slow, saved ground on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. QUALITY BREW stumbled after the start
and closed the gap on the turn but had no impact. BRONZE AGE forced the pace and dueled on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch
faded. TOBRUK was in mid pack and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. AREOCENTRIC had no speed
and showed nothing while outrun.
