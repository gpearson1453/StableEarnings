HEIDI tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, launched her bid two wide entering he final turn and quickly assumed
command, and drew clear late under confident handling. EL QUETZAL broke sharply and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the backstretch,
was overtaken soon after entering the final turn while saving ground at the rail, and finished determinedly one out from the rail in the drive to hold the place.
AIRAFFAIR away alertly and tracked the leader two out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering he final turn, and
finished with late interest from along the rail in deep stretch to garner a share. GUNS N AMMO stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing three out
from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive. MY COLLEGE FUND unhurried early while dropping
back to trail, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact. SUNGOLD
BEAUTY away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but was
outfinished in the stretch drive. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of SUNGOLD BEAUTY lodged a claim of foul
against the rider of AIRAFFAIR for alleged interference entering the lane. After review the claim of foul was disallowed and no change was made to the
original order of finish.

out from the rail in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and drew clear late under confident handling. SLEW'S DA BOSS settled off the early
