Footnotes
GARRETTS GAMBLE broke out and bumped rival at the start, cleared quickly and wen to rail on the backstretch, maintained clear lead through the turn and
into the stretch, responded well to urging and held well while clear. EVER FOR EVER EVER tracked leader inside of rivals on the backstretch, maintained
rail position through the turn and into the stretch, gamely kept on in the stretch while being second best. ANDRE THE SAINT off slow at the start, stalked the
pace while in the three path, entered turn three wide, asked for run in the middle of the turn and made some progress, entered stretch in the four path while
being urged, finished a clear third while flattening out late. STORMY VENTURE tracked leader outside of rival on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and
into the stretch in the three path, lacked needed response in the lane while weakening. MY TREASURE LAKE broke cleanly and lacked speed at the start,
trailed field throughout, while never menacing. NAUGHTY CHILD bumped by inside rival at the start, showed good speed but quickly attempted to be taken
up by rider, veered out while rider attempted to pull him up, stayed well off the rail while galloping around the track, finally being eased past the eighth pole
and walked off.
