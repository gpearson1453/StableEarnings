Footnotes
WORLDS ON HIGH contested the early pace between horses, took over past the three-eighths, shifted in clear on the rail turning for home, drifted out from
left-hand pressure and was clearly best. PERSPECTIVE got bumped by MARVALOUS MIKE at the start, went along in the three-path behind the leaders on
the turn, came out a bit wider for the drive and finished well. EMIT pressed the pace four wide, moved inward coming off the turn, and flattened out.
BASTIEN LE BROWN broke sharply, was strung out five wide chasing the leaders for a half-mile, and faded in the stretch. ZAMFIR battled up front three
wide between horses, and tired after a half-mile. MARVALOUS MIKE broke out bumping PERSPECTIVE at the start, and never reached contention.
ORULA broke out bumping SILVER DOLLAR CITY at the start, and tired inside. ALADO broke a couple lengths slow and veered out a few paths, and was
outrun. EL GUAPO was finished early. SILVER DOLLAR CITY received a bump from ORULA at the start, dueled inside several rivals early, and gave way
on the turn.

Footnotes
TANTALIZING GAL prompted the pace outside TIME SENSITIVE, was put to pressure after six furlongs, and prevailed after a long, hard drive. TIME
SENSITIVE the pace inside, dug in when challenged into the stretch, and stayed on gamely. GOLD COUNTRY got bumped by MY GLORY nearing the first
turn, was roused early on the far turn, and rallied between horses through mid stretch to gain the show. WORKIN ECLIPTICAL had a ground-saving trip,
and was no threat through an even effort. TONALA saved ground outrun to the far turn, angled to the far outside in upper stretch and improved position.
SISTER IS DEVIL raced five wide early, made her way in a couple paths advancing after six furlongs, but could not sustain the bid. AWESOME VIEW came
in nudging V K PRINCESS into MY GLORY nearing the first turn, raced four wide into the backstretch, and could not reach contention. OKALANI brushed
with FAITH'S A BLUEBIRD at the start, was carried out extremely wide by that rival entering the first turn, and was never close. FAITH'S A BLUEBIRD
brushed with OKALANI at the start, swerved out sharply to avoid the spill approaching the first turn, and dropped far back after a half-mile. V K PRINCESS
got nudged into MY GLORY by AWESOME VIEW going to the first turn, rushed up outside rivals, and was through after a half. MY GLORY got bumped into
GOLD COUNTRY by V K PRINCESS and stumbled badly unseating the rider nearing the first turn, was apprehended and escorted off. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT APPROACHING THE FIRST TURN BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
DOCTOR D J was covered up early behind and between horses, slipped through on the rail as AEQUOR drifted out a path turning for home, battled through
the lane on his left lead and edged EARTHQUAKE after a long drive. EARTHQUAKE bumped with AWESOME PARTY at the start and was outrun early,
rallied to contention with a five-wide run around the turn, reached even terms outside DOCTOR D J through the furlong grounds, and just missed. AEQUOR
vied early inside ST JOE VIPER, edged away around the turn, drifted to the two-path entering the lane and was overhauled from both sides. QUASAR
MOON saved ground outrun early, angled five wide off the turn and offered a mild response to gain a share. MACHIAVELLI stayed close early inside,
lodged a brief bid two then three wide approaching the stretch, and flattened out. ST JOE VIPER vied for the lead outside AEQUOR for a half-mile, and
gave way on the turn. RED FOG came under a ride on the turn four wide, and was empty. AWESOME PARTY brushed the right side of the gate, took the
worst of a bump with EARTHQUAKE and bobbled after the start, chased outside the leaders three wide, and was through after a half-mile.

Footnotes
STARSHIP ARAMIS set the pace inside, got collared by LONG GRAY LINE after six furlongs, battled back on the rail and took a hard-fought decision.
LONG GRAY LINE went along in the second flight between horses early, loomed menacingly three wide approaching the quarter-pole, poked a head in front
outside STARSHIP ARAMIS through upper stretch, and just missed after a long drive. DEXTER ROAD lodged a mild bid four wide late on the turn, flattened
out into the lane but ran on best of the others. DONE ACTING was outrun early, gained mildly into the stretch, but had nothing more. TAKEDOWN saved
ground at the back for six furlongs, shifted to the far outside past the eighth-pole and passed tired horses. GEMOLOGISTER broke open the gate prior to
the start, pressed STARSHIP ARAMIS from outside for five furlongs, and gave way approaching the stretch. PAPACHO stayed in range early, and dropped
back five wide approaching the stretch. FIRST AND THREE became restless in the gate prior to the start, saved ground and faded before reaching the
stretch.

Footnotes
AFFICIONADO (FR) vied early inside MIJET, deferred entering the backstretch, moved outside around the far turn and rebid after six furlongs, wrested
command into the stretch and drove clear, then held sway under left-hand pressure. GLORIOUS GAL was never far back, shifted out three wide being given
her cue at the top of the lane, and finished with good energy outside the winner. GALILEOS BALLERINA settled in the two-path most of the way, and
offered a mild response to pick up the show. OMNIA saved ground in range early, swung four wide approaching the lane, and lacked the needed rally.
MIJET vied outside the eventual winner around the first turn, cleared off and moved inside after a quarter-mile, could not match strides with AFFICIONADO
turning for home, and gave way. EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE raced three wide for six furlongs, came further out into the stretch and could not gain. MARAMA
checked off heels heading to the first turn, and never reached contention.

SPEEDING from outside with 70 yards remaining. SPEEDING hooked up inside STRONG AZTECA for the early lead, won that battle after a half-mile and
edged clear, but was worn down in the closing stages. TOOLEGITTOQUIT bumped with BEYOND HEAVENLY early, hugged the rail throughout, and rallied
mildly for the show. MY BEAUTY PRINCESS broke slowly, moved up quickly inside, stayed close to the stretch, lacked the needed rally in the two-path and
was outkicked for third. MAKE A SCENE moved inside getting outrun early, and passed only tired horses. STRONG AZTECA vied outside SPEEDING for
nearly a half-mile, and gave way in the three-path turning for home. MASTERING BELA bobbled slightly at the start, showed early speed three wide, and
dropped back on the turn. GLADYS hit the left side of the gate and was slow coming out, was urged along two wide into the turn, fanned to the six-path for
the drive and made no headway. BEYOND HEAVENLY bumped with TOOLEGITTOQUIT early, and dropped back before completing a half.

GO GONE GONE popped clear after the start, rated along inside to the top of the stretch, and kicked away under a mild drive. SOLDOLLIE bumped twice
with SHOSHONE BRAVE near the half-mile pole, was reserved into the turn two wide, swung to the four-path at the top of the lane, and was up outside
GETTHE MUNY BERNIE for the place. GETTHE MUNY BERNIE hugged the rail throughout, and finished evenly. SUBLIME APPEAL chased outside the
winner to upper stretch, and tired. SHOSHONE BRAVE bumped twice with SOLDOLLIE and checked back at the half-mile marker, and could not recover.
JOYFUL HEART chased three wide to the quarter-pole, and retreated.

Footnotes
JAMAICAN took control early, rated along inside to the stretch, got shaken up approaching the eighth-pole and had enough to hang on. KAREN'S COVE
lost ground to the leaders through the second quarter, moved out four wide being roused past the five-sixteenths, rallied with good courage outside the
winner and just missed. STARSHIP APOLLO exchanged bumps and brushes with TRANSITIVE at the start, trailed despite heavy urging past the half-mile
pole, came widest off the turn still well behind, found his best stride belatedly in the middle of the track, but was too late. GETTININTOMISCHIEF prompted
the pace outside the winner to the stretch, and ran on one-paced. STAR JUANCHO stayed in range for a half-mile inside, angled wide into the stretch, and
made no headway while drifting out considerably. TRANSITIVE exchanged bumps and brushed with STARSHIP APOLLO at the start, raced three to four
wide around the turn, and tired. AREYOUTALKINGTOME was finished early. SPA JAZZ showed some early speed three wide, and was through after a
half-mile.

Footnotes
YAFA broke out at the start, tracked outside the early leaders three wide, took over and went clear midway on the far turn, and drew away mildly hand
urged. BACKSPARK saved ground in range early, came under a ride three then two wide around the far turn, could not menace the winner, and was best of
the rest. LEARNT raced two wide around the turns, and was clear for the show with an even finish. MS. MELANIA was outrun for six furlongs, came four
wide for the drive, and went by faders to gain a share. THE RAIN IS COMING shied out from YAFA and bumped ALAIA QUEEN at the start, went along two
wide in midpack, and failed to menace. V K STAR became fractious dislodging the rider in the gate prior to the start, veered in at the break striking her head
on the left side of the gate and forcing CAPE ELIZABETH inward, and was never close. SILVER SKY SMOOTH was bumped lightly by ALAIA QUEEN at
the start, and was outrun inside. MELANIE'S PRIDE vied outside MARIA'S MIRAGE to the far turn, and was through after six furlongs. ALLIE AND JAZZY
wandered out several paths after the start, stayed fairly close four wide to the far turn, and faltered. ALAIA QUEEN got bumped by THE RAIN IS COMING,
brushed into SILVER SKY SMOOTH and took up at the start, and was far back throughout. MARIA'S MIRAGE set a pressured early pace inside, faltered
after a half-mile, and was eased up in the stretch. CAPE ELIZABETH was forced in badly by V K STAR at the start, lost contact with the field and had no
response to urging.
