HONOR RUN stalked the pace, raced four wide into the lane and finished well to be clear late under strong handling. IT'S PAZIBLE stalked the pace, raced
four wide nearing the quarter pole, led but couldn't match strides with the winner in the latter stages to finish second best. MIAMI STEVE settled off the early
pace, moved up six wide through the stretch and closed in gamely late. FERNWOOD DRIVE dueled for the early lead along the inside and weakened
through the drive. VICTORIOUS BEAR dueled for the early lead and gave way. KISSEDTHEGIRLS raced four wide at the eighth pole and never was a
factor.

Footnotes
BAD SUENO was a bit reluctant to load, backed into the starting gate, pressed the early leader while racing two wide down the backstretch, veered in
sharply mid stretch, bumped rival. An objection was filed and stewards ruled Bad Sueno to be placed second for interference in the stretch.
MYSUREWINWILLIAMS showed good early speed along the inside, was bothered mid stretch by rival and finished gamely to the wire. Mysurewinwilliams
was placed first through disqualification. BILETNIKOFF was allowed to settle early, angled five wide through the stretch and finished willingly to the wire.
MR. HAND FULL stalked the early pace, raced six wide through the lane and had not enough late. CRESCENT WARRIOR was slow early and never
threatened. THEKIDSBACK dropped back early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor.

Footnotes
GLAD ROCK (GER) showed good early speed while racing along the inside and held gamely to be clear under strong encouragement. BLACKLINE stalked
the early pace, moved up through the drive along the rail to finish second best. CENTERFOLDPROSPECT stalked the pace from the outside, moved up
four wide past the quarter pole and finished willingly to the wire. ZAYA settled off the early pace, moved up three wide in the stretch and showed good late
interest. BACK TO BACK was unhurried early, raced four wide in the lane and had not enough late. MEAD AVENUE was slow early, moved up seven wide
into the upper stretch and made a mild late gain. SADLER BAY was slow early on, raced six deep into the stretch and never was a factor. BAYOU JAM
stalked the early pace, raced four wide nearing the quarter pole and failed to respond. MAYNOOTH settled off the early pace, raced five wide past the
eighth pole and had no late response. YOWZA YOWZA YOWZA was allowed to settle early, lacked racing room at the eighth pole and never threatened.
KAMEHAMEHA pressed the pace and tired while racing two wide. CAUSFORCELEBRATION raced four wide into the lane and failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
GYPSY GIRL showed good early speed from the outside and held gamely through the drive under strong urging. THREE COINS was allowed to settle early
on, moved up three wide through the lane and finished second best. SAND IN MY SHOES stalked the pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no
final winning bid. WINROSE ELLIE was slow early, moved up seven wide into the upper stretch, angled in through the drive and had not enough while
racing along the inside late. WE HAP NOW settled off the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no rally. VICTORY TIME was hustled
along from the inside and tired. LADY MISTRESS failed to respond. TOURBILLON ROSE pressed the early pace and gave way. BLACK COAST raced far
back and never threatened.

Footnotes
LAGOM showed good early speed to set all the pace and drew off in the drive to be well clear under steady handling. BRAMBLE BAY angled in soon after
the break, saved ground around the first turn, moved up four wide into the lane and finished well to be second best. CHICLET'S DREAM stalked the pace,
raced along the inside and had no final winning bid. SUNDRENCHED stalked the pace, raced along the inside around the far turn into the stretch and had
no response. CURLY RUTH settled off the pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. LA BABIA was unhurried early, raced three wide
in the stretch and never was a serious threat. MIKO stalked the pace and tired while racing two wide. ROONEY was slow early and never threatened.
BETTER YET raced far back and never menaced.
