Footnotes
TURN IT ON bumped with HOKKAIDO after the start, sprinted clear and moved inside, and was driving to stay in command. AWESOME VIEW saved
ground behind the pacesetter to the stretch, had aim in the two-path after straightening away, and did not have enough. HOKKAIDO bumped with TURN IT
ON shortly after the start, was outrun three wide to the lane, and rallied despite taking some awkward strides through the late stages. LUISANA PRINCESS
broke slowly, raced three wide around the turn, and gained mildly through the stretch. MISBEHAVING LADY was no factor two wide. SISTER IS DEVIL was
outrun three wide. MIRACULOUS brushed with ALAIA QUEEN at the start, and was always outrun. GEM THIEF was behind the leaders when she lost her
action and checked early on the turn, dropped back steadily, then had the rider dismount on the gallop-out and was escorted back. ALAIA QUEEN brushed
with MIRACULOUS at the start, and was never close. MAIKO pursued the winner from outside for three furlongs, and tired. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
BION MAGIC vied for command inside KATNISS KAN early, shook clear five-sixteenths out, and widened under pressure. MATRACA raced in the two-path,
rallied into second turning for home, and finished evenly to secure the place. COMMANDING LADY saved ground throughout, and lacked the needed late
response on her left lead. ABARRIO FOREVER was outsprinted between horses heading into the turn, and had no solid bid. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE broke
outward, and was no factor three wide. DONA CAMILE was well placed behind the battling leaders early, had no response midway on the turn four wide,
and drifted further out tiring into the stretch. KATNISS KAN vied outside BION MAGIC for three furlongs, got shaken off soon after that, and dropped back.

Footnotes
DIENDA grabbed the lead with an alert getaway, rated along inside to the stretch, and stayed clear under a drive. LA RUSIA was strung out five wide on the
first turn, moved in through the middle stages, and rallied outside through mid stretch to go clear of the rest. CHEROKEE SOUND was outrun to the stretch,
and rallied in the two-path to overhaul MAHKATO for the show. MAHKATO saved ground throughout, and weakened through the final furlong.
DONNAMEUP prompted the pace outside DIENDA for six furlongs, and tired in the stretch. JOSEFA moved up four wide leaving the first turn, stayed in
range for six furlongs, and faded. OUR FANTASY dwelt at the start, and was far back throughout. EMOLGA raced three wide, and was finished after a
half-mile. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
CURTIN'S UP hooked up inside UNO BABY BIRD from the start, battled back after being headed a furlong out, and had just enough to withstand
MAKINALEGACY through the last strides. MAKINALEGACY lagged well back to the stretch, rallied on the far outside staying on his left lead, and just
missed. UNO BABY BIRD dueled outside CURTIN'S UP throughout, poked a head in front at the eighth-pole, and weakened slightly late. MAQUIAVELO
raced three wide around the turn, and gained some ground in the lane without menacing. RESTLESS ROCKER broke inward and was a step slow to begin,
and was outrun inside. SILVER CONNECTION raced two wide on the turn, and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
HEAT OF THE NIGHT was forwardly placed two wide from the start, moved into second position entering the far turn, rallied outside CHESS'S DREAM
through the stretch and edged away late. CHESS'S DREAM bumped with GOLOVKIN at the start, was on hold early inside, moved out three wide
approaching the backstretch, took over outside LOST LOVER after a half-mile and moved in, stayed clear to mid stretch, and could not hold off the winner.
GOLOVKIN bumped with CHESS'S DREAM at the start, saved ground on the turns, rallied willingly inside the top two but did not have enough. EL
ROMANTICO was in a bit tight between horses midway on the first turn, advanced after six furlongs, had aim outside the leaders through the drive, but
lacked the needed final response. RAULITO advanced inside after six furlongs, but flattened out after straightening away for the drive. STAR MISSION was
three wide early, went four wide into the far turn, and posed no threat. ANDRES EDUARDO stayed close early three or four wide, and had no response to
urging on the far turn. GHOSTLYPRINCE entered the first turn four wide, and failed to make his presence felt. LOST LOVER showed speed inside for a
half-mile, had nothing left into the stretch, and was eased up late.

Footnotes
ONE FAST took the lead with a sharp start, dug in when challenged by CAPTAIN DUKE approaching the stretch, and kept that rival at bay to the finish well
off the rail. CAPTAIN DUKE bumped lightly with BABY BROTHER at the start, pressed the pace outside ONE FAST, bid into the lane, and could not get
past. HANDSOME PRINCE advanced along the inside around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and was one-paced outside the top two. TRISOMIA was
outrun three wide early, cut the corner into stretch and gained mildly without threatening. RACK GIN raced two wide around the turn, and faded outside in
the lane. BABY BROTHER was jostled lightly between CAPTAIN DUKE and TAAMER at the start, chased outside early, and gave way on the turn.
TAAMER bumped lightly with BABY BROTHER at the start, showed brief speed outside, and was through after a half-mile.

Footnotes
SAND DRIFT advanced inside through the middle fractions, shifted out three wide past the quarter-pole, overhauled AVENIDA MANANA from outside
through upper stretch and kicked away, and was geared down late. YAKO hugged the rail into the stretch, moved to the two-path a furlong out, and rallied to
go clear for the place. AVENIDA MANANA pressed SASSY JUSTICE from inside early, gained the upper hand on the far turn, was no match for the winner
into the stretch, and weakened on the rail. FANTASTIC KINGDOM was outrun early, improved position after six furlongs four wide, and went by tired foes in
the stretch without threatening. SASSY JUSTICE set a pressured pace outside AVENIDA MANANA, and weakened approaching the stretch. PAINT THE
CORNERS tracked outside the leaders for six furlongs, and tired. TRILBY raced three to four wide, and never reached contention. VINYARDNINA was
always outrun. VALLEY DATE was finished early. TROPICALITY moved in a bit from the four-path on the first turn, and was through before reaching the
stretch. LEDECKY was never close. AMAZING AUDREY was never prominent.

Footnotes
FRONT LOADED grabbed the lead early inside, moved well clear turning for home in the two-path, and was kept to pressure never in jeopardy. SANDYS
BLAZE broke outward, saved ground into the turn, moved out in upper stretch, and rallied on his left lead to best the others. GREEN MANSIONS tracked
outside the leaders early, and lacked the needed response with an even finish. GEONOSIS got pushed out by SANDYS BLAZE at the start, was taken to
the rail soon after that, and posed no threat. VINNIE VAN GO stumbled at the start, pressed FRONT LOADED for an eighth of a mile before getting shaken
off, and faded. JOE DI BAGGIO tossed his head at the break and came out last, and tired four wide on the turn. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
DADDY'S JOY sprinted clear inside soon after the start, responded in the stretch and kept AVUNCULAR at a safe distance. AVUNCULAR broke out, stayed
close early three wide, had aim outside DADDY'S JOY through the lane, and came up second best. TIMETASTIC turned in an even effort through a
ground-saving journey. ALLURING RUMBA raced three wide around the turn, and failed to menace one-paced in the drive. BEAUTIFUL DIVA hit the left
side of the gate and was off slowly, saved ground on the turn, and never reached contention. LIVIN AT THE BEACH shied out from AVUNCULAR at the
start and was slow to get going, and remained well back. REMARKABLE SILVER was no factor inside. RAIN OF BLESSING showed brief speed, and was
outpaced around the turn.
