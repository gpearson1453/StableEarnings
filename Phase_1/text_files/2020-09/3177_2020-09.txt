YANKEE DIVISION In hand along the three path, quickly took the lead on the last turn, opened up when asked and widened as clearly best. WHAT A
CATCH Unhurried along the three path, gained on the last turn, chased and was no match. CHIC N WILBUR Hopped at the start, unhurried along the three
path, took the rail on the last turn, appeared blocked nearing the quarter pole, took up sharply, angled out when clear and failed to regain that momentum
needed. KERRY BOY Well placed along the two path, gained on the last turn and weakened inside. NEW JERSEY JOHN Four wide leaving the first turn to
the top of the lane, angled wide and weakened. HOROSCOPE Vied for the lead along the three path early, took charge after a half mile, tracked into the
lane and gave way. TOASTY BOY Vied for the lead early, tracked inside to the last turn, dropped back and was eased over the wire.

Footnotes
MASTERKEY in hand along the rail, slipped inside into the lane, responded, gained and bested OXLEY GAP for the win. OXLEY GAP set the pace along
the two path while pressed, cleared on the last turn and couldn't last. CURLIN'S NEW MOON was well placed four wide into the backstretch, three path on
the last turn, angled out and finished with interest. WIN BIGLY unhurried, four wide on the last turn, angled out and made a late bid. CONSTRUCT forced
the issue along the three path to the last turn, two path into the lane and weakened. ANALYZE YOUR LUCK unhurried along the three path, five wide into
the lane and failed to respond. TOP HAT VOYAGER well placed four wide up the backstretch, tracked on that path into the lane and tired. BALDONNEL
broke in the air, lagged back while always outrun. SALEAS saved ground and tired.
