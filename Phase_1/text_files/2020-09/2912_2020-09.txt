Footnotes
MR. SNAP quickly took over and rated a long lead inside, came under a bit of pressure into the lane and held on well with steady insistence.
CRYPTOSONDE saved ground off the pace then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved from that point but ran out of ground.
ELEANOR'S DIAMOND raced in the four path the first turn and was well off the pace into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came
through the far turn at the rail, took over third mid-stretch but lacked room through later yards. MODERN COWPOKE settled off the pace about the three
path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn still in the three path, but flattened stride in the lane. PAP'S LEGACY raced in the four
path the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. STERLING GLADIATOR became restless in the gate and raced off the early pace
inside, picked up the chase into the backstretch but faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
VILLAGE PRINCE rounded the first turn in the five path and settled close into the backstretch, challenged the runner-up leaving the three eighths pole and
contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dueled to even terms mid-stretch and dug in determinedly to inch ahead. DUSKY rated the pace
inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and kept the advantage over the winner while nearest the rail on the far turn, but was met at
even terms mid-stretch and grudgingly ceded to that one through later yards. HOMEMADE MOONSHINE settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn
then eased out into the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole and raced in range of the lead three wide on the far turn, but flattened stride the
final sixteenth. UNCLE JESSIE raced with the pace through the front stretch and stalked into the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, then faded into the far turn. OVER SALTY rated just off the early pace inside then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, though, faded
into the far turn. JACK'S DREAMER rounded the first turn in the four path, raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response. WHAT ABOUT
SHORTY was reluctant to load then stalked the early pace three wide, showed no response leaving the three eighths pole, faded readily on the far turn and
was not encouraged through the final quarter mile.

BOOBY TRAP settled off the rail early on then stalked three wide into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead at the quarter,
raced clear midway on the far turn then drew off under steady urging. BANISHMENT took the lead into the first turn and rated the pace, was met at the nine
sixteenths pole and came under pressure toward the three eighths, gave up the lead into the far turn, dropped back midway on the turn but dug in through
the stretch to retain second. COMPROMISO stalked the pace from the three path and moved to even terms at the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase leaving
the three eighths then flattened stride in the duel for second. DEPUTY DREW raced well back from early contention then eased out into the backstretch, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little more. CASHTON PEAK settled off the early pace in the two and
three paths then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and had little left. DELP saved ground off the pace then
picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, then bolted and lost his rider past the quarter pole.

MIO'S LONG TERM broke inward to make contact with Orileys Typhoon and was hustled to the lead to set a pressured pace, dueled clear past the eighth
pole and held well under steady encouragement. BLACK CANDY pressured the pace early and continued at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, but
dropped back past the eighth pole and couldn't close the gap in the stretch. PLEASANT LEE gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn and dueled for third.
PAGAN SMART broke out to make contact with Orileys Typhoon then picked up the chase, rounded the turn off the rail then ceded in the stretch duel for
show. ORILEYS TYPHOON came away a step slow and was jostled on the chute, dropped well back from early contention, rounded the turn near the rail
and could only improve his position. FLASHY READY RICK gave chase inside, raced off the rail on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF WINDSOR took immediate control to rate the pace, was met at even terms by Schlosser at the nine sixteenths pole and dueled clear of that
one past the quarter, then widened under steady encouragement. GLEN'S CASTLE settled back in the two and three paths then made a bid into the
backstretch, was eased to the four path on the far turn and steadily improved to take second later yards. ROYAL BLUE saved ground off the pace, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path then outfinished for second later yards. MACANAO settled off the pace in
the two and three paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, but weakened past the eighth pole.
CASTLEINTHEMEADOW raced off the pace toward the inside, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then flattened stride at the rail on the
far turn. SCHLOSSER stalked the early pace from the three path and moved to even terms at the nine sixteenths pole, challenged from that point but
dropped back past the quarter pole and weakened leaving the far turn. B RASEN raced well back and was outrun. THE PREDICTOR raced in the four path
the first turn and stalked the pace from the seven eighths pole, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths then faded into the far turn.
