Footnotes
CATANIA stumbled leaving the gate, raced on the inside just off the pace up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path approaching the five sixteenths
pole, and gained ground the length of the stretch, wearing down the frontrunner to just get up in time. SISTER RULER bobbled slightly leaving the gate,
dueled for the lead between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and raced on gamely in the stretch, getting caught in the final strides.
RACHELGOTSTEPHEN dropped back leaving the gate to trail the field up the backstretch, got rolling from the two path around the turn, and continued to
improve position in the stretch. WHITE LIES broke through the gate prior to the race, broke well at the actual break, raced inside just off the pace up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly. JOLIE RULER dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile,
began to drop back from the rail around the turn and was empty in the stretch. LOVINHERWASEASY pressed the pace on the outside early, raced in the
three path around the turn, swung wide coming off the turn, entered the stretch in the six path and tired from there.

Footnotes
MUNN PASSAGE chased the leading trio, came in near the seven sixteenths, chased in the three to four path on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch,
rallied under a drive and got up in time. LIVING VICARIOUSLY pressed the pace outside of VINCENT WILLIAM down the backstretch, dueled outside him
on the turn, put him away at the three sixteenths, cleared to midstretch, but could not hold off MUNN PASSAGE in the final sixteenth. PALVERA tracked the
leading pair down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, bid three wide into the lane, kept on three wide but was outfinished. MR. TIP settled near
the rear inside of POSEIDON'S PASSION and SAVAGE, steadied near the seven sixteenths when POSEIDON'S PASSION unseated her rider, saved
ground toward the rear around the turn, was driven into the lane, rallied inside but was outfinished. SAVAGE broke outward, settled three wide toward the
rear, raced in the five path on the turn, floated into the lane in the five path, and chased on while ultimately not threatening the top four. GRAND HIDEAWAY
was herded out when SAVAGE broke outwardly, soon trailed, altered out near the seven sixteenths to avoid a fallen rider, trailed in the five path on the turn,
veered out twice in the stretch under a left-handed crop, took closer order but never proved a threat. VINCENT WILLIAM was sent for speed, set the pace
down the backstretch while pressured by LIVING VICARIOUSLY, dueled inside of that foe through the turn, went to a drive into the lane, was headed for
good at the three sixteenths, and weakened inside. POSEIDON'S PASSION settled near the rear between horses, unseated her rider near the seven
sixteenths as MUNN PASSAGE crossed in front of her, finished the course without a rider, was apprehended by an outrider after the race, and walked off.
THE STEWARDS PERFORMED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE SEVEN SIXTEENTHS. UPON REVIEW, THEY MADE NO CHANGE TO
THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
TALES OF WAR walked out of the gate, trailed the field from the rail through the opening half mile, began to move up quickly between horses nearing the
three eighths pole, entered the stretch from the four path and continued to gain ground on the outside, pulling clear in the final furlong. BEAR TRAPPE
dueled for the lead on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground on the lead around the far turn, was caught in the
stretch by the eventual winner and finished well to be second best. DRAGUNOV raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in
the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far turn from the two path and finished evenly in the stretch, no match for the top two. HIDE THE
EVIDENCE hit the gate at the break, raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, continued around the
far turn in the two path and gained ground late in the stretch. ORCUS raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the mild
of the pack on the outside, made a mild gain of ground from the three path around the far turn and outfinished in the stretch. TABADDOL saved ground
around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the
stretch. ZANFORCE dueled for the lead between horses through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the far turn and tired in the stretch.
FORT DIXIE dueled for the lead from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back nearing the three eighths pole, drifted
out considerably coming off the turn and raced in the middle of the track down the stretch far behind the leaders. MIDNIGHT JOKER raced in the three path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, navigated the far turn from the three path and made no bid. TIO CHUY raced in the four path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch near the pace on the outside, began to fade from the two path around the far turn and continued to tire in
the stretch.

Footnotes
MERLIN'S SONG cleared to the lead into the first turn, kept on clear down the backstretch, was confronted on the outside past the three eighths by WAR
CHEST, CLOUD TO GROUND, and CANARY ISLANDS, turned them away into the lane, and kept finding enough. WAR CHEST stalked the leader, bid
outside him past the three eighths, could not get past him into the lane, kept on in close range but was ultimately held at bay. A P IS LOOSE chased through
the clubhouse turn and two wide down the backstretch, continued patiently into the far turn, was taken two wide past the quarter for a rally, continued under
a drive inside of CLOUD TO GROUND in upper stretch, came out and bumped that foe past the furlong, kept on three wide, and proved best of the rest.
AND WON was taken to the rear, continued to trail toward the inside through the far turn, was urged inside into the lane, responded with a rally and missed
the show narrowly. STOCK TRADE raced near the rear inside of CANARY ISLANDS through the first turn, continued inside of A. P. IS LOOSE down the
backstretch, continued patiently in the three to four path on the far turn, rallied four wide in the lane but was outkicked. CLEAR N CONVINCING raced at the
inside of the chasing flight, tracked close up in the pocket through the far turn, was hard asked for a bid between MERLIN'S SONG and the rail in upper
stretch, could not find enough, tossed his head past the furlong pole, and was no threat late. IWILLPERSEVERE settled two wide near the rear through the
first turn, continued in second last down the backstretch, raced in the four to five path on the far turn, and improved position five wide in the lane. CANARY
ISLANDS tracked the leading pair three wide through the first turn while hard to settle, chased two wide down the backstretch, made a four wide bid on the
far turn, came three wide into the lane, and weakened. CLOUD TO GROUND chased between horses through the first turn while racing rank, pulled into the
backstretch to track the leading pair, bid three wide on the far turn, was in range between horses to midstretch, took up past the furlong mark when A. P. IS
LOOSE came in, and faded.

Footnotes
KINGSBURY DREAM saved ground around the first turn, raced inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path approaching the quarter pole,
pulled clear entering the stretch and continued to draw off to the wire. LION LOVE raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the
middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far turn from the two path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole, and chased the winner home, the best of
the rest. HERO ALEXANDRA trailed the field from the rail through the opening half mile, angled out to race in the three path around the far turn and gained
ground on the outside in the final furlong. TANNAH'BLU raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch between horses in the
middle of the pack, started a bid from the three path near the three eighths pole, improved position around the far turn, and finished evenly in the stretch, no
match for the top two. KURINGAI broke slowly, raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack, angled in
to run in the two path around the far turn and made a mild gain of ground from there. ENCHILADA chased the leaders from the three path around the first
turn and up the backstretch, moved up to challenge the frontrunner at the half mile pole, dueled for the lead in the two path around the far turn and
weakened in the stretch. LAVERNS LASS raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the
outside, navigated the far turn from the three path and flattened out in the stretch. LADY SPIDUTES raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the
backstretch off the pace, saved ground around the far turn and made no bid. EADS BRIDGE bobbled leaving the gate, led the field from the rail around the
first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch. SAMIS CAR pressed the pace from the two path
around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to tire from the two path near the three eighths pole and continued to fade in the stretch. MY IDOL raced
in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside, began to drop back approaching the far turn, entered the stretch from the
three path and was not a factor. Due to a timer malfunction the final time was retimed electronically.

weakened late, was caught inside the sixteenth pole, and narrowly lost the place. GALAHAD KID settled two wide in the rear pair early, was pushed along
between horses on the turn, came into the lane two wide under a drive, shifted further out, and uncorked a belated four wide rally. V MAN tracked well
behind the pacesetter inside of CITY POSITION, was urged in the two to three path on the turn and driven into the lane, and chased evenly. HOMER was
bumped between TRES GENERACIONES and CITY POSITION in the opening strides, chased behind the tracking flight early, continued to chase between
horses around the bend, came into the lane three wide between horses, and chased on without finding the needed kick. TRES GENERACIONES broke
outward and bumped HOMER in the opening strides, raced inside horses at the rear of the main pack early, chased in the two to three path on the turn,
improved position in upper stretch but was outfinished. ROLL CALL raced between horses at the rear of the main pack early, lost position into the turn,

three wide in the rear group around the turn, and mustered no rally. MUSIAL settled in the rear pair inside of GALAHAD KID, saved ground on the turn, and
made no bid. CITY POSITION came in slightly in the opening strides and bumped HOMER, tracked the pace outside of V MAN early, was pushed along two

Footnotes
MEMORIES OF ARTIE bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back to save
ground around the turn, re-rallied entering the stretch, took over passing the eighth pole and kicked clear from there. LASTEN IMPRESSION raced outside
in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, launched a bid between horses near the quarter pole and gained ground
on the outside in late stretch. SILVER HIT raced inside in the middle of the pack early, saved ground around, gained ground on the rail in late stretch, and
drifted out, bumping with IRISH LIGHTED ROAD near the wire. IRISH LIGHTED ROAD chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, continued to chase the eventual winner down the stretch, gave way in the final sixteenth of a mile and drifted out and then back in again,
bumping with SILVER HIT just before the wire. LASTFORTINOFAMILY raced inside off the pace in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn,
gained ground late on the inside through the stretch, was blocked when SILVER HIT and IRISH LIGHTED ROAD bumped into each other and forced to take
up sharply in the very final stride. CAROLINA AIRNESS dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, took over the lead from the two path around
the turn and tired in the stretch. NIT PICK tracked the leader between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn,
weakened between horses in the final sixteenth of a mile, and ran into traffic at the wire. TO THE BANK settled in the middle of the pack up the backstretch,
raced between horses in the three path around the turn and came up empty in the stretch. BERACUDA HEART hit the gate at the break, raced outside
early, navigated the turn from the four path and made no bid. BE YOUR OWN HERO was reluctant to load, raced off the pace at the back of the pack early,
came around the turn in the two path and was not a factor. DISTINCT THUNDER was bumped and then blocked leaving the gate, trailed the field the entire
way around the oval, saved ground around the turn and never got involved.

RANK AND FILE tracked the leading pair inside foes early, continued to track while saving ground through the turn, advanced to the lead inside of the
dueling pair into the lane, cleared under a drive and held safe despite some drifting back and forth. BETTER ANGELS raced between horses early, settled
toward the rear approaching the turn, chased in the two path around the bend, was urged in the three path into the stretch, dropped to the inside in upper
stretch, and rallied up the rail for place. TANGO CITY chased three wide early, advanced in tandem outside of SHOP AMERICAN approaching the turn,
raced two wide around the bend, rallied two wide into the lane, kept on two to three wide, could not reel in the winner and lost the place late. ENGLISH
dueled inside of NIVA down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, floated into the lane in the six path, could not match RANK AND FILE who
was rallying well inside her, chased on three wide to midstretch and flattened late. FLAMING settled three wide in the rear group early, improved three wide
around the turn, sustained the rally into upper stretch and kept on mildly inside horses in the final furlong. NIVA was bumped by DIAMOND STELLAR in the
opening strides but sent forth unperturbed to duel outside of ENGLISH, continued to vie on the lead in the four path on the turn, proved no match for the
rallying RANK AND FILE while floating into the lane in the seven path, and flattened out. DIAMOND STELLAR broke inward, bumped NIVA, then bounced
out and bumped CLASSOFSIXTYNINE, raced between horses in the rear group early, continued two wide in the rear flight around the turn, and passed
tiring horses in the stretch. CLASSOFSIXTYNINE was bumped by DIAMOND STELLAR in the opening strides, settled back to the rear, saved ground in the
trailing pair around the turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. SHOP AMERICAN bobbled inward at the start, was hustled for position inside early,
tracked while saving ground around the bend, had no further response when asked along the rail into the stretch, and weakened. SISTER MARY CLETUS
raced between horses in the tracking flight early, weakened four wide around the bend and did not make a bid in the lane. BEZEL SET tracked three wide
early, weakened five wide on the turn and was no factor in the lane.
