Footnotes
TIZANOXBOW, just off the rail and just off the early pace, fell back a bit mid stretch but then came on again, closed determinedly and was along in time.
WEST FORK set the pace inside, extended his lead mid stretch but then just failed. TOWN JAK steadied off heels and lost action briefly in the opening
furlong, raced two wide, angled in entering the stretch and closed well. HERE WEGO challenged three wide on the turn, drifted out under left handed
pressure through stretch and faded. EL DULZURA failed to menace. RIO ABAJO, fractious in the gate, prompted two wide then tired. FLATEXCEL was
unsettled in the starting gate, had his head turned to the left at the break, saved ground and steadied on the far turn.

moved wide into the stretch and closed well. SOUL PLANET pursued the loose pacesetter, led into the stretch and weakened. WITH ME WITHOUT ME
trailed far behind then offered some late energy. CASEYOUDIDN'TKNOW quickly sprinted clear, widened before half mile then faded in the stretch. TIZ A
DATE chased off the pace outside then proved empty in the stretch. FREE COFFEE settled off the leader three wide and weakened. SUPERGIRL POWER
urged close up inside for three furlongs and stopped. PASTICHE dropped well behind early and was never in contention..

MOVIE SCORE stalked the pace two wide then took the lead leaving the turn, edged clear near mid stretch and won under strong handling. VOLODINA
broke slowly, advanced while racing very wide, drifted wider through the stretch, challenged but then flattened out late. CREEDIBILITY was four wide and
just off the early pace, weakened late. NOT IN THE MOOD saved ground and failed to threaten while passing faders. IRON LILLY appeared to be in the
grasp of an assistant starter at the break with her head downward and to the left, was bumped by REIGNING FIRE soon after then failed to threaten.
BAAQEYA, in the three path and just off the pace, tired. ELISSAS SECRET was three wide dueling for the early lead then tired. REIGNING FIRE also
appeared to be in the grasp of an assistant starter at the break, broke in a tangle, came in and bumped IRON LILLY, fell far back and never threatened.
MORISSETTE saved ground just off the pace then gave way leaving the turn. DEEP CANYON dueled for command just off the rail then stopped. THE
STEWARDS LITE THE INQUIRY SIGN REGARDING THE START. AFTER REVIEW, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

E J'S REVENGE outrun early, advanced inside on the turn, angled out in the and rallied clear. FERRY quickly took control inside, led to the final sixteenth
then yielded. TRUE WISDOM stalked the pacesetter outside, loomed a threat but flattened out. OGEECHEE moved very wide into the stretch and lacked a
rally. WHITE BLUFF urged close up inside to midway on the turn and faltered. COLORADO GRANDSLAM forced the pace between rivals to the turn and
faded. LUNAR ROVER lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. MY PIRATE lacked speed, moved wide on the turn and was no factor. OFF DUTY
chased near mid-pack and weakened steadily. REFUNDED dropped back at the start and was always outrun. DOWN WITH THE KING saved ground well
behind and gave way.

KADENS COURAGE broke slowly as the horses left the starting gate twenty four minutes past scheduled post time, was hustled up between foes, shook
loose leaving turn and edged away under mild handling. TOO MUCH JOHNNIE was returned to the paddock for an equipment adjustment prior to the start,
was between early then moved closer to the and gained place. DOUGIE was between rivals on the backstretch then was left with rail, eased out near
stretch while moving but then flattened out. ACERE came out sharply leaving gate bothering several rivals, split foes while never far back and had no rally.
JUMP SHOT was bumped around and took up sharply leaving the gate, fell far back early then passed faders. SPOOKY ISLAND raced wide and dropped
back steadily. PROUDMIAMICITIZEN came out leaving the gate contributing to the crowding then showed little. RULES, bumped around leaving the gate,
recovered and vied wide but then tired. LOUIE'S WISH was also bumped leaving the gate then showed nothing. WAR OF THE NORTH saved ground and
tired. BUILT BETTER was very wide and never a serious threat.
