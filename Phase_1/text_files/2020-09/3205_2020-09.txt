Footnotes
ANNMARIA pressed the early pace, rallied at the quarter pole, drew off in the stretch under left handed urging. AND I KNOW was never far back and saved
ground, angled out three wide in the stretch, finished well and was second best. EOWYN'S PARADISE was well placed throughout on the inside, lacked a
bid late and went evenly. IMPAZIBLE MINK set the pace for three quarters, then weakened. BLU HAWAII was allowed to settle and failed to menace. FILLY
RIDE contended early and was through after a half. FORMER BUNNY was no factor. BEAUTIFUL CREATURE was outrun.
