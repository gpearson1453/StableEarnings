Footnotes
LADY OF CHARLIE stalked lone leader outside of rival on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, entered stretch in the three path, cut in to the margin
slightly in upper stretch, then reeled in foe inside the final sixteenth as rival tired. ROBBERYINPROGRESS assumed command quickly on the backstretch,
entered turn with commanding lead along the inside, entered stretch with good energy, asked for best mid stretch and started to shorten strides late in deep
stretch to get caught. THICK SMOKE settled along the inside on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside, had to alter out due to tiring rival and took
most of the turn two wide, made mild progress in the stretch under steady urging. TAHOE BLUE stalked leader along the inside on the backstretch, entered
turn along the rail, started to lose ground early on the turn, entered stretch along the inside and had no response.
