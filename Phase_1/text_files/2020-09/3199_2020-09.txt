the front and under the whip proved best. TAPIT HAPPY JOHN Hopped at the start, unhurried along the two path, took the rail midway on the final bend,
appeared to be blocked into the stretch, checked, responded and finished well inside. OPEN LENGTHS In hand along the three path, eased out in the lane
and found his best stride late. MCENTIRE Well placed four wide, gained along the three path on the last turn to challenge from between at the top of the
lane, chased and weakened. PRINCE HALO Vied for the lead off the rail to the top of the lane and tired. LIGHTNING ROB Five wide early, four wide into
the last turn and failed to respond. HEIGHT Three path on the turns, was not a factor. OLIVER WITHA TWIST Vied for the lead along the three path,
