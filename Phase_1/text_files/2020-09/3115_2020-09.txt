NATTY NORA was away alertly, then was crossing over shortly before the five eighths pole shutting off rivals, then went on to set the pace while clear and
off the rail, was headed on the turn by the five sixteenths pole, repelled that bid and drew clear in the stretch to prove best under a drive. FACEYS FIRST
had to check past the five eighths pole, then went up to make a four wide bid past the five sixteenths pole, but could not sustain that bid while clearly second
best. BLU VIXEN checked her past the five eighths pole, then went on to make a mild bid four wide on the turn, but could not get to the top two while clearly
best of the rest. DE LA CHA CHING steadied slightly past the five eighths pole, but failed to menace. HANDFUL OF HEROES checked hard on the inside
past the five eighths pole and dropped back. The stewards posted the INQUIRY and there was multiple jockeys objection into the running near the five
eighths pole, The jockey of FACEYS FIRST claimed foul versus the jockey on NATTY NORA, also the jockey on BLU VIXEN claimed foul on FACEYS
FIRST and NATTY NORA. The stewards ruled that NATTY NORA be disqualified from first and placed third.

SKYKAT was well rated early and made a three wide bid past the seven sixteenths pole, quickly drew off past the quarter pole, then was getting tired last
sixteenth but was able to hold sway late. LADY ELSA was allowed to settle while five wide on the backstretch, launched a bid three wide on the turn by the
quarter pole, then continued to close well in the stretch but was too late, good effort. MESANGE chased the early pace on the inside, eased out three wide
past the five sixteenths pole, but had no significant gain while besting the rest. OXBOWINDY was four wide into the first turn, pressed the pace three wide
on the backstretch then tired. BOO'S GAL was away alertly and gunned to the lead to set the pace on the inside then gave way.

Footnotes
PASS THE BISCUITS was well rated early and made a three wide move to go on even terms for the lead past the quarter pole, drew off in the stretch under
heavy right handed encouragement to prove much the best. RAMPAGE was allowed to settle on the inside, angled out in the stretch for racing room to rally
well for the place. CONRAD IN CHARGE chased the early pace four wide, lacked the needed stretch bid while gaining the show award. BARRIER was sent
up to set the pace on the inside while clear, was headed past the quarter pole, jockey lost whip leaving the three sixteenths pole, faded final furlong. OUR
BALDY B had no rally while saving ground. ALWAYSBEHUMBLE chased the early pace five wide then weakened.

three sixteenths pole, then drew clear in the final furlong to prove much the best. S S TROOPER was sent to the lead to set the pace while clear, was well
handled on the front end, then was headed at the top of the stretch, came again late to be second best. MOONSHINE JUSTICE was four wide into the first
turn, tracked the pace setter four wide on the backstretch, made a menacing four wide bid entering the stretch but flattened out the final furlong.
EXPRESSED was allowed to settle early, came into the stretch three wide but had no punch. TWISTED MIRACLE was settled back early, angled out in the
stretch to offer a belated rally. FORWHOMTHEBELLTOLL chased the pace four wide then weakened. SPOTLIGHT JUSTICE was reserved early, came into
