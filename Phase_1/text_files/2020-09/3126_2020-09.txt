pole and cleared the field in the final stages. UNWRITTEN set the pace early, raced along the inside into the lane, was between horses near the eighth pole
and no match for the winner in the late stages. LIL MISS HOT MESS was bumped at the start, stalked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane,
inched ahead while four wide near the eighth pole but faltered late in the drive. TAPIGAL came out at the start, tracked the pace early, was in the three path
into the lane, made a bid while three wide near the eighth pole but weakened late in the drive. ISABELLE'S JOY raced back early on, was in the four path
into the lane, faded late in the stretch, bled and was vanned off after the race. TRACI'S GREELEY was bothered at the start, chased the pace early, was in
the three path into the lane and empty late in the stretch run. OVER THE BLUES was never a factor. FED POLICY trailed the field throughout.

KUORA (PER) stalked two wide, vied outside of EXTRA EFFORT around the far turn, forged an advantage from that foe at the furlong pole, cleared off at
the sixteenth pole, then held off CASH OUT's late surge at the wire. CASH OUT sat reserved off of the pace in the two to three path around both turns,
shifted four wide to be outside of HIS GLORY at the quarter pole, grinded away outside of that foe in upper stretch before shying a bit from that rival
approaching the furlong pole, then quickened inside the final furlong, surged late, but missed. EXTRA EFFORT set the pace along the inside, held an
advantage from KUORA (PER) around the far turn, dug in to cling to a lead in upper stretch, but was headed by that rival at the furlong pole, and yielded.
HIS GLORY stalked the pace in the three path, came into the lane in range of the dueling leaders, but lacked a kick to make a bid, drifted out approaching
the furlong pole, and tired. TEENAGE KICKS raced far off of the pace two wide, took back slightly when in a bit of tight quarters between horses into the far
turn, then failed to factor. REDEEM MY HEART stalked along the inside, saved ground around the turns, but failed to produce a bid and tired through the
lane. TURTLE TRAX was bumped slightly by an outer foe at the start while breaking slowly, then saved ground far off of the pace around the turns, and
failed to get involved.

Footnotes
GIROLAMO'S ATTACK hopped and stuttered a bit when the gates opened and was last away, recovered to track from midpack along the inside, advanced
inside of foes around the turn to loom from the pocket at the five sixteenths pole, shifted out passing the quarter pole to be four wide and between horses,
then rallied to produce a bid passing the furlong pole, and finished strongly to win going away. SENOR JOBIM settled off of the pace in the two to three path
around the turn, then split foes three wide in midstretch, rallied inside of MISTER K through the late stages, and prevailed over that foe at the wire for place
via a photo. MISTER K got rank in tight quarters between horses while close to the pace early on, steadied back approaching the five furlong pole, then
stalked the leaders from the three to four path around the turn, got floated five wide by GIROLAMO'S ATTACK passing the quarter pole and outkicked by
that foe in upper stretch, then kept on through the lane, but missed place to an inner foe. COLTONATOR saved ground far off of the pace, glided out
through midstretch to be six wide and outside of foes at the furlong pole, then rallied mildly and belatedly passed tired foes. HANSENS MISCHIEF dueled
for the lead two wide, but was headed by an outer foe passing the quarter pole, and weakened through the final furlong. MY MAN FLINTSTONE lied close
up between duelers early on, took back and stalked them from the two to three path around the turn, produced a three wide bid for the lead passing the
quarter pole, cleared off approaching the furlong pole, but was no match for the eventual winner approaching the sixteenth pole, then wilted through the field
approaching the wire. SATCHEL DE RITCHES dueled for the lead inside of HANSENS MISCHIEF, but was headed by multiple foes in upper stretch, and
weakened. CRYPTO hopped a bit a the start, trailed the field in the four path around the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
WILD POPIT saved ground in midpack, tracked ENERGIZER from behind as that foe forged clear in upper stretch, shifted outside of that foe approaching
the furlong pole, produced a bid passing that marker, and edged clear in the final sixteenth. ENERGIZER stalked along the inside around the turn, inherited
an advantage in upper stretch after the pace setter drifted out, drew clear passing the three sixteenths pole, but was headed by WILD POPIT at the
sixteenth pole, and was second best. UBER KIRK was crowded at the start due to an inner foe breaking outwards, saved ground far off of the pace around
the turn, and stayed on along the inside to pass outer tiring foes through the late stages. BREAKING NEWS was crowded between horses at the start,
advanced from off of the pace around the turn after shifting from the three path to the four path at the three furlong pole, then leveled off in the five path
through the lane. KADRI got rank while bumping with an inner foe at the start, stalked the clear leader two wide, bid turning for home, but was herded out by
the leader passing the quarter pole, and was outkicked by inner and outer foes in midstretch. SYMPHONIC tracked from midpack in the three path, but was
outkicked by a wider foe turning for home, got blocked behind foes afterwards in upper stretch, then failed to factor thereafter. JULIUS broke outwards
causing multiple foes to be crowded at the start, set the pace, drew clear in to the turn but drifted outwards while inside of KADRI passing the quarter pole,
and was swallowed between horses passing the furlong pole. SPYCRAFT was off slowly, attempted to advance inside of horses on his own power through
the opening furlong, but was restrained when trying to squeeze into tight quarters along the rail inside of WILD POPIT at the five furlong pole, got rank and
stayed keen to the half mile pole, then was outrun thereafter.

BELLE LAURA stalked two wide, vied between horses around the far turn, kicked clear passing the quarter pole, and held safely through the lane while
being kept to task to the wire. QUICK WITTED trailed along the inside around the first turn, then advanced mildly in the three path around the far turn before
swinging five wide turning for home, then produced a rally through the lane, but did not have enough to catch the leader, and proved second best. MY GAL
BETTY sat reserved along the inside around the turns, but was blocked behind foes at the three sixteenths pole, tipped five wide through midstretch, and
offered a belated charge for show. AMAZIMA stalked three wide, vied outside of a pair of foes around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with one of those
rivals in upper stretch, then tired and got surpassed by multiple foes through the lane. JULIA'S READY was caught three wide off of the pace around the
first turn, advanced to be in range of the leaders four wide at the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong marker, and faded.
STRIKE MY FANCY stalked along the inside, shifted two wide turning for home, but failed to produce a bid and weakened. FROND tracked from midpack
two wide between horses around the turns, was floated three wide turning for home, and failed to factor. CHARETTE set the pace, held an advantage from
a pair of foes into the far turn, but was headed by those rivals at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened in upper stretch.

ENTREAT was off a step slowly and got pinched back at the start, tracked from midpack in the four path and outside of foes around the turn, inched forward
to loom large turning for home, then sustained a grinding rally after MOVIE MOXY kicked away in upper stretch, and wore that foe down at the sixteenth
pole. MOVIE MOXY stalked three wide, vied around the turn before forging an advantage from CAPTURE at the quarter pole, kicked clear, but was caught
by ENTREAT passing the sixteenth pole. MOTOWN GIRL hesitated at the start, stalked along the inside and from the pocket around the turn, shifted two
wide turning for home, then four wide after MOVIE MOXIE kicked clear, then stayed on through the lane to secure show. CAPTURE vied two wide early on,
forged an advantage between horses at the three furlong pole, but was headed by her outer counterpart at the quarter pole and yielded through the lane.
SPEIGHTY SHIRL broke outwards and bumped HAPPY TUNE, raced off of the pace in the two path around the turn before swinging to the five path turning
for home, but failed to threaten. MISS MESS was off slowly, trailed along the inside, then failed to factor while passing tired foes through the lane. TIZSO
AWESOME hopped at the start and was off slowly, rushed to set the pace along the inside, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. HAPPY TUNE was
bumped solidly at the start by SPEIGHTY SHIRL, raced off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, and weakened in the six path in upper
stretch.
