STAY HYDRATED stalked the loose leader between foes, bid wide into the stretch then edged away under moderate pressure. PAT'S GRONK settled
inside within striking range, angled out in the stretch and was up for the place. SPLITZVILLE chased wide throughout, moved briefly closer on the turn, then
flattened out. LOVINISEASY lacked speed in the two path then went evenly through the stretch. E T'S NIGHT RANGER broke alertly and to the right, set a
clear pace then came up empty in the stretch. STEPHANOPOULOS trailed while saving ground then passed a stopping rival. SOMERSET BAY was urged
close up outside then stopped abruptly.

LUCKY IMAGINATION took the lead soon after the start, set the pace just off the rail, shook loose leaving the turn and won with speed to spare.
JUMPINTOACTION broke slowly, was wide while outrun then rallied for place. VISITING ANGEL saved ground just off the pace then tired. RUN
FLORENCE RUN broke a bit awkwardly, raced wide and tired. ICE DIAMOND, two wide and just off the pace, gave way. SUGAR SHACK DANCER saved
ground and gave way. BROAD JUMPER was three wide and just off the pace and had little left.

JW'S THIRD MISCHIE forced the pace outside, took over near the quarter pole, bid clear and lasted while weakening late. DEERSTALKER saved ground
throughout, advanced on the final turn, rallied well but was too late. BRILLIANT WORTH set a measured pace along the rail, WAS collared on the final turn
and faded late. OUR CLAIRE BEAR saved ground off the leaders and was finished after half a mile. SUCCEED QUIETLY displayed poor action from the
outset, was eased after a quarter mile and subsequently vanned off. MY MAN ELVIS was very unruly during the saddling process in the paddock and was
ordered scratched by the stewards.

Footnotes
DREAMS UNTOLD stalked the pace four wide, moved easily to the front when ready at the top of the stretch and edged clear while ridden out. BRILLIANT
CHASE vied inside under a rating hold, moved clear near the three eighths pole, was hooked into the stretch but continued gamely to the finish. BARCODE
bobbled soon after the start, settled inside, angled out but proved empty in the stretch. SCREEN SAVER forced the pace between rivals then began
faltering on the turn. GEEBERT lacked speed racing wide and was never in contention. ARRECIFE trailed for half mile racing wide and was always outrun.
FINAL RITUAL pressed the pace three wide between foes then stopped on the turn.

Footnotes
KIDNAPPED, inside vying for the early lead, was eased back and raced just off the pace, steered out three wide rallying, drifted wider entering the stretch
and after taking the lead, edged away. DO IT MY WAY was left with the rail, dueled inside and battled gamely to the wire. SMOKUM PEACE PIPE raced
wide while never far back, lacked a strong closed kick. BEREN ducked out leaving the gate, was straightened and was then angled in to duel two wide
before fading. DOWNTOWN DOC BROWN, just off the rail. drifted out under left handed pressure in early stretch then drifted in under right handed
pressure soon after. ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR saved ground and wasn't a serious threat. BAVARIA saved ground, drifted out near quarter pole and was no
factor. HANFORD was never a serious threat. CRYPT broke awkwardly hitting the right side of the starting gate then never threatened. MISSED THE BUS
was never was a factor. CHIEF REIDER, wide and just off the pace, was finished leaving the turn. CONTEMPLATING, between foes, showed nothing.

WAIT FOR IT set a measured pace inside, widened easily into the stretch then remained safe while asked for run through the final eighth under a mild drive.
SOMEDAY JONES saved ground throughout, rallied into the stretch but could make only a gradual late gain. TUDOX EXPECTATIONS earned a brief
narrow edge outside, forced the pace to the stretch, continued willingly but tired. HOCKEY PUCK stumbled at the start, raced close up outside and proved
empty from the quarter pole home. BROAD STREET BULLY raced between rivals and just off the pace and gave way. JUMP FOR ALEX dropped back
racing wide and steadily weakened. WISE JUDE lacked speed and trailed throughout losing contact with his field.

MIDTOWNCHARLYBROWN, inside, fell back on the turn, was being steered in but then changed course to the outside and split rivals, took the lead inside
the sixteenth pole and won under strong handling. MIDNIGHTCHARLY broke slowly and was outrun in the four path, angled to the rail for the stretch and
closed. FINAL SHOT raced wide while just off the pace, fell back a bit in mid stretch but then was coming back. DANCING BULL, racing two wide setting the
pace, drifted out then in in early stretch and stretch and faded. JAGUAR POZ failed to be a serious threat. JOHNNY RITT raced erratically on the
backstretch while just off the early pace then gave way.

Footnotes
ITS A JOURNEY settled well behind inside, angled out to secure room into the stretch, split foes while being bumped in between but was up in time in a
determined effort. PUCA PENNY angled inside on the first turn, rallied and edged to the front in the stretch but was nailed in the closing yards. WILDCAT
CARTRIDGE dropped back early, advanced wide, loomed a threat, in mid-stretch but was outfinished. REDEEM MY HEART trailed early after a sluggish
break, rallied very wide and closed strongly too late. SAFFRON SPIRIT rated inside just off the pace then flattened out in the stretch.
SHEMAKESMEHAPPY vied inside early, stalked in the two path, led briefly but weakened. DIXIE SERENADE raced wide, moved closer after half a mile
then faltered. TROLLEY RIDE dropped back early, raced in traffic and lacked a rally. UJJAYI was urged close up very wide, bid before half a mile then came
up empty. MOON CHANT vied outside early then led inside, was collared on the final turn and tired. PROMISED STORM well placed outside the dueling
pacesetters but stopped in the stretch.

PINK CADDY, was never far back, raced widest into stretch, took the lead leaving furlong grounds and slowly inched away. SUNNY DALE racing just inside
winner early then got to the rail, took the lead briefly near mid stretch but was unable to match strides late. BRONX BEAUTY broke very slowly and then
was angled to the rail, moved to the outside on the turn and into stretch and closed. I'M THE TALENT, just off the rail disputing the pace, tried to bear out
entering stretch and weakened. TRACE OF GRACE failed to be a serious threat. HEY MAMALUKE set the early pace between foes and had little left. E T'S
GYPSY WOMAN, three wide, was finished early.

Footnotes
THE CRITICAL WAY broke alertly and dueled in the two path, drew off on the turn and remained clear rest of the way driving. SMOOTH B pursued the
winner between rivals early and continued willingly to earn the place. ADMIRAL ABE was urged close up along the inside, dropped back briefly on the turn
and weakened late. FLYINGONTHEGROUND chased along the inside then flattened out through the stretch. AMERICAN TALENT raced close up outside
to the stretch and faltered. HOLLYWOOD TALENT chased very wide throughout and lacked a rally. THISCATCANJUMP was taken up between rivals soon
after the start and no factor. VENTRILOQUISM lacked speed, drifted out into the far turn and lacked a bid. WORD ON A WING hustled close up between
foes, was in tight and steadied into the far turn. AMBLIN MAN lacked speed, moved inside and was never in contention. SMOKIN NITRO flashed speed
outside to the far turn and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
CAPITAL Q, four wide early, three wide on the turn, took the lead near mid stretch and while drifting out, held on. TIZ GRACIE dueled for command
between foes, fell back slightly mid stretch then was coming back. FASTROADAHEAD in the three path early, went four wide into stretch, lugged in
challenging then was being carried out late. ODD GAL, in the four path early, swung wider into stretch, steadied off heels in deep stretch. ROLLS ROYCE
JOYCE, between foes dueling for the lead, weakened late. EBO SPECIAL steadied after start, went between rivals on turn, drifted in through stretch. LION
AND THE WOLF saved ground and failed to menace. LULA'S ROADRUNNER, four wide and just off the pace, tired. AKNA was wide and dull. BOTH
LUCKY OLIVIA ROSE AND CRAZY BEA WERE INJURED IN THE STARTING GATE AND SCRATCHED ON THE ADVICE OF THE VETERINARIAN.
CONSOLATION DAILY DOUBLES WERE PAID, ALL OTHER WAGERS ON THEM WERE REFUNDED.
