Footnotes
ONE SMART PRINCESS was well away alertly, then was well placed from the inside past the half mile pole, made a three wide bid past the five sixteenths
pole, assumed command while drawing clear past the furling marker, then held sway late to prove best under a drive. ROYAL CHEYANNE was reserved
early, came into the stretch while saving ground, angled out in the stretch for racing room, closed well late but could not get to winner. PERFECT JUSTICE
set the early pace while clear, was headed on the turn by the winner, faded in the drive while besting the rest. CRAFTY JUSTICE was allowed to settle
early, came into the stretch while saving ground, angled out in the stretch but offered no significant rally. SHE DA ONE chased the early pace while four to
five wide throughout and weakened in the stretch.

CARSON RULES sralked in the four path, bid at the quarter pole to be clear and just lasted. SUNSIGN was unrushed outside, rallied six wide and just
missed. CLEARING WAIVERS raced in the four path, bid late but missed. MY NORTHERN STAR dueled outside of a foe, came in and bumped that one in
the stretch and gave way. COMPLEX JUSTICE dueled inside of a foe and bumped with that one in the stretch. IT'S THE SUNRISE raced in the two path
but had no late bid. WEBER faded. KITKAT KITTEN saved ground, then faded. MY NORTHERN STAR then had to survive an inquiry and an objection by
the rider of COMPLEX JUSTICE alleging stretch interference.

BLESSING safe to prove best, driving. TOUCH OF BLESSING tracked the pace while three wide, made a bid with the winner on the far turn while four wide,
but could not get to that rival while clearly second best. ARTFUL MEMORIES was three wide into the first turn, then was allowed to settle but offered no rally
while besting the rest. GO GERTIE GO failed to menace. LADY DA DA was through after a half mile. SHE'S A SALTY B was not a factor. The jockey of
