EL VALE tracked the pacesetter, angled in for the stretch run, responded to his cue and kicked clear in the stretch. JIMMY'S MARCO grabbed the early
lead, was outpaced leaving the turn and stayed on in the stretch. SHERWIN raced forwardly while three wide and lacked a rally. COUNTRY LOVE never
menaced. THE LONE GRAINGER was always outrun. PHILLIP JUSTIN was awkward at the start and trailed. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS
RACE WAS HAND TIMED BY THE EQUIBASE CHART CALLER.
