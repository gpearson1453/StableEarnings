Footnotes
SILVERZAR quickly took control then drifted out and lasted while tiring in the final furlong. CURLIN'S KNIGHT pursued the winner, moved inside that rival in
the stretch gained but could not get by. DEERSTALKER lagged far behind then rallied through the stretch too late. MY MAN ELVIS was urged close up
outside, drifted wider near the quarter pole and flattened out. ELREGAL chased wide while well behind and was never in contention. MUNTAHEZ saved
ground within striking range early then gave way readily. DE PUNTA A PUNTA dropped back early and lost contact with his field.

Footnotes
TOMASCO set the pace in four path, drew out again near mid stretch and then lasted. MITHRA, between rivals early, swung to the outside leaving the turn,
closed and just missed. HAPPYASCANB raced wide chasing and weakened slightly. BURN AND TURN, outside winner stalking, lacked a strong closing.
FOX IN THE FOG, far back inside, passed faders and returned bleeding from a cut mouth. LT. COLUMBO raced wide and failed to menace.
EPIGRAMMATIST saved ground and stopped.

PLATINUM PAYNTER held a measured lead inside, took over on the final turn and pulled away under moderate pressure. IT'S SO EASY stalked the
dueling leaders inside, was up in time for the place while no match for the winner. WITCH prompted the winner outside to midway on the final turn and
faded. HEAVENLY HATTIE dropped back early then passed rivals without menacing. PAOLLA'S HEART chased in mid-pack and lacked a rally. LOST
POINT trailed for five furlongs saving ground and was no factor. KISSKISS TELLTELL saved ground close up and gave way readily. TIG TOG (IRE) settled
outside off the pace and began faltering on final turn. SAVANNAH'S DREAM lacked speed and was never in contention.

Footnotes
TOP HAT TIZZY came out leaving gate, saved ground and challenged for the lead near stretch, took the lead a sixteenth out and edged away. BON HEIR,
jostled leaving the gate, recovered and challenged four wide turn, took the lead but then was no match. PANSY saved ground disputing the pace, drifted out
leaving the turn and weakened. CHEVY TO THE LEVY was three wide in top flight and held on well. BALTIMORE BEAUTY broke slowly, saved ground
early, moved out and closed too late. GIRL POWDER saved ground and failed to menace. DESCARADO, outside, was never a serious threat. ONLY ESSA,
very wide, failed to menace. BERBERSLILBRIEBRIE, two wide and just off the pace, tired. PEACH ALLEY came in leaving the gate, dueled between foes
then stopped suddenly.

Footnotes
BELLARMINE HALL settled inside, bid to the front at three quarters, quickly pulled away and remained well safe under mild urging. DRUMMOND saved
ground off the leaders, rallied on the final turn, continued nicely but was no match for the winner. SLEEPLESSDREAMMORE lacked speed, advanced three
wide down the backstretch then flattened out. LEXATOGA broke slowly and raced far behind, offered a brief bid at the far turn and lacked a further
response. BREW DOG dropped far behind and was never in contention. JANE'S FACTOR was well placed early in the two path then stopped on the final
turn. ENDUROS DIAMOND set a clear pace off the inside and was finished after three quarters.

Footnotes
EASTPORT, well placed racing wide, drifted out under right handed pressure entering the stretch, rider switched to left handed stick, EASTPORT continued
to drift out, brushed KNOKKE BY THE SEA through the final furlong and then was brushed by that rival near the wire. KNOKKE BY THE SEA was outrun
early, rallied four wide on the final turn, was also drifting out under left handed pressure, was twice brushed lightly then came in and brushed the winner in
the final strides. SURFER BOY GEORGE saved ground and stopped. SYNERGIZED dueled for the lead two wide then tired. SACRIFICING IT ALL raced
wide and failed to menace. SINCERE MAN came out at the start then steadied briefly, saved ground and never threatened. PAWN IT BACK was wide and
never a serious threat. BILL'S MAFIA dueled for command in the three path, then stopped. DONNIE BRASCO, just off the rail and just off the pace, stopped
and was eased. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF KNOKKE BY THE SEA AGAINST EASTPORT FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS
DISMISSED.

Footnotes
MT SURIBACHI rated in the two path off the leaders, angled out advancing into the stretch and eagerly rallied clear. HOLD MY CALL pursued the loose
pacesetter, led on the final turn but yielded late. GOOD SOLUTION raced close up outside then began fading after half a mile. INDIRECTLY broke
awkwardly and raced far back then showed some late energy. SAMBAM dropped back inside then closed the gap without menacing. A I INITIATIVE lagged
far behind then passed fading rivals. HAZASPITTIN' IMAGE broke sluggishly and was outrun early then flattened out through the stretch. MR. VINCENT
was fanned very wide on the first turn and retreated. ANOTHER SMARTY urged close up early inside then stopped abruptly. FROST'S SONG rushed to the
front early when headstrong and stopped abruptly. CITY GUY saved ground, moved briefly closer before half a mile then gave way. Fractional times were
unavailable.

Footnotes
ROCK ON LUKE took the lead at once as the horses left the starting gate twenty three minutes past scheduled post, set the pace in the three path under
rating, drew away in stretch and won in hand. PATEGORY ONE saved ground in closest pursuit, drifted slightly through the stretch and was no match.
KNOW IT NOW, bumped soundly leaving gate, moved to the outside, chased then tired. MILTON THE MONSTER came out at the start bumping KNOW IT
NOW, was run up on heels and steadied along from the 9/16 pole to the far turn, moved out and was no factor. JAYJAYDEE was fractious in the post
parade and while being loaded, was between second flight then tired. COMMISSIONER G was never a factor. HEALTHCARE HEROES ducked out badly
leaving the gate then angled in and was no threat.

Footnotes
O'KRAM settled inside, advanced on the final turn, collared the leader,then won the head bob in a long stretch duel.. PETULANT DELIGHT set the pace
along the inside, widened at the quarter pole, was collared passing the eighth pole, fought gamely and just missed. FLAT OUT FLYING eased back inside,
angled out in the stretch, loomed a threat but weakened. LUVINMEISEASY lacked speed between rivals, was asked for run on the final turn but proved
empty. BOB'S MY UNCLE fanned wide into the first turn, remained wide and was no factor. THE ROBERT dropped back wide under firm rating, moved
closer after the half then faltered. TRULY A MOON SHOT dropped well back, moved inside and gave way. CREATIVE GENIUS prompted the leader
outside for half a mile and stopped.

Footnotes
IRONBOUND took the lead at once, set the pace well off the rail, was clear mid stretch and held off rivals under strong handling. SMART RAGS, between
rivals early,was left with the rail on the turn, drifted leaving the turn and was gaining. FOREST RIVER, between rivals early, moved out and challenged on
the turn, fell back a bit but then was slowly coming back. ADULATION, between rivals early, moved out on the turn and flattened out. SECRET SECRET
was in motion in the starting gate and broke slowly, raced wide and passed faders. KID MAC COOL was in the three path and just off the pace before tiring.
A J'S WAY angled to the rail, saved ground to stretch, eased out and failed to menace. SLOT was wide and just off the pace then gave way. INCENSED
threw his head to the right and got hung up on the gate breaking far behind the field and then showed little. DIAMOND SQUARE, three wide, was finished
before a half. BLINDING raced wide and failed to menace. MARRIAGE FEVER showed little.
