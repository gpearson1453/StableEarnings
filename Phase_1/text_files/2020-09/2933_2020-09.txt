was angled three wide into the stretch and rallied. NIKKI'S NIGHT raced forwardly along the inside and stayed on well. TAPTHATLUCK failed to threaten.
SASSY AIN'T I chased while three wide and lacked a rally. CYNDIES CHARM broke in the air at the start and was never involved. SHACKLEROC reared,
swerved in badly at the start and was outrun. SWEET WALKIN' SUGA forced the pace, was pulled up at the eighth pole and had to be vanned off.
FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO SEVERAL INCIDENTS AND MADE NO CHANGES.

MR. ANKENY grabbed the lead, edged clear on the turn and held sway in the stretch under confident handling. ST. LOUIE GUY outpaced while three wide,
advanced on the turn, was swung four wide into the stretch and finished well. RETALIATED raced forwardly along the inside, remained inside for the stretch
run and kept on. LOUDEN'S GRAY reserved early, commenced his bid on the turn, moved out five wide for the stretch run and offered a late bid. YO Y ME
chased while five wide and could not menace. WASABI MOON was always outrun. WHENTHEDOVESCRY stalked the early pace and retreated.
RECOUNT showed little. MINER HEAT raced in striking position while three wide and faded.

Footnotes
DISCREET INVASION settled well, advanced on the turn, was swung four wide into the stretch, rallied strongly and was along in time. BASIC CHANCE
forced the pace, took over on the turn and was reeled in late by his onrushing stable mate. GIO NASTY ONE hopped at the start, was reserved and
displayed some good late energy while closing along the inside rail. EDGE OF ACKWORTH chased along the inside and lacked a rally. IOWA NATIVE
raced forwardly while three wide and came up empty. JUSTA STREAK never menaced. HOLT COUNTY was very awkward at the start, trailed by some
ways and showed belated interest in the stretch run. SHIP BOSS failed to threaten. THISBOY'SACOWBOY was always outrun. WOKE UP WILD set a
demanding pace, was headed on the turn and faltered.
