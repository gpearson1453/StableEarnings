gain and edged up in the final strides. DO YOU LOVE ME broke a step slowly from the gate, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the
stretch, lugged in, then angled in late and missed while edging up for the place. DANA'S BEAUTY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on
when challenged into the stretch, then was outfinished. FAST LANI tracked the pace to the turn, angled out and gained position on the two path through the
turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, weakened late and held a share. GAME THEORY well placed and outside, gained position two and three wide
through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and evened out. HONEY BEEST ran evenly for a half and had no stretch rally. CHARLITA broke slowly and ran

Footnotes
SUPER DONNA G sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin to the lane, then drew off and was kept to the task. BROOKLYNS
SURPRISE well placed and between rivals, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and closed well for the place. OH MY
PRECIOUS allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the show. LA
LIMONADA allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and got up for a share. MARY ELIZABETH rated
back in the early going, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, ducked in and faded. ROLLING MO mid pack, looped three
and four wide through the turn, bid five wide into the lane and could not gain. MONBA NUMBER FIVE stalked the pace on the outside, angled in and saved
ground through the turn, came through inside, steadied briefly and fade. VICTORIA E was a brief factor, inside.
