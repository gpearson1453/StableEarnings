Footnotes
O'KEEFFE dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the first turn, kicked clear entering the stretch, and drew off in the final furlong
while being kept to the task to the wire. SUPERSTAR DIVA trailed well behind the field up the backstretch, began to improve position racing around the far
turn, swung wide to enter the stretch from the four path and closed rapidly on the outside to make up considerable ground in the final sixteenth of a mile.
WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY stumbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to chase the dueling pair up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three
path, and was unable to go with the eventual winner in the stretch. PATSY J raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, came around the turn in
the two path and improved position on the rail in late stretch. OH SO TERRIBLE raced off the pace through the opening half mile, navigated the turn from
the two path, angled in nearing the quarter pole and passed tiring horses in late stretch. HEY HEY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and offered no bid. PUNTSVILLE dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn,
entered the stretch from the two path and tired in the final furlong.

was taken two wide in upper stretch, veered out and bumped AMAZING ANNIE in upper stretch, rallied smartly in the final furlong, rolled past REND LAKE
BABY with about forty yards to go, and cleared. RARE ACTION ATTACK settled toward the rear inside of AMAZING ANNIE early, continued patiently as
that foe began to improve position approaching the half, raced three wide on the turn, rallied four wide through midstretch, and got up for place five wide in
the final jumps. REND LAKE BABY attended the pace three wide early, took the lead past the three eighths and coasted clear, continued well clear to

settled near the rear outside of SLOANER early, was pushed along three wide on the turn, came into the lane between horses, rallied four wide in the final
furlong but was outfinished for the place. I DON'T WANT TO GO was hustled for speed inside set a pressured pace, was headed by REND LAKE BABY at
the three eighths and no match for her past that point, and gave chase two wide in the lane. SLOANER was slow into stride, settled near the rear inside of
SHARPERTHANME, chased between horses on the turn, was taken three wide past the furlong mark, rallied but was outfinished for the place. AMAZING
ANNIE raced toward the rear outside of RARE ACTION ATTACK early, improved position approaching the half, was pushed along inside into the turn,
swung out three wide into upper stretch, was bumped by PRESENT OF HERO when she veered out in upper stretch, and flattened out in the final furlong.

in the final furlong. MAGNITUDE TEN raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch between horses in the middle of the pack,

Footnotes
DOM THE BOMB was hustled to the lead, set the pace while saving ground through the turn, remained clear into the stretch, drifted out in the lane, but held
while kept to the task. GREY MASK was bumped by TIO CHUY in the opening strides, chased the leading trio outside of KNOCKYOURBLOCKOFF,
improved position from the three eighths while racing in the five path, came into the stretch three wide, pursued the pacesetter under a drive, gained late but
could not catch him. KNOCKYOURBLOCKOFF raced inside of GREY MASK early, chased in the two path on the turn, came into the lane under a drive
inside, and chased on while no match for the top two. R H SMOAKEM was slow into stride, settled at the rear, improved while saving ground on the turn,
and showed good interest between horses in the lane. GREELEYS ICE chased midpack down the backstretch and in the five to six path on the turn,
improved three wide in upper stretch, but ran only evenly late. TIO CHUY came in and bumped GREY MASK in the opening strides, chased in the two path
on the turn, kept on inside in the lane but was outkicked. MINISTER'S GLORY settled near the rear, chased on two wide past the three eighths, came three
wide into the lane and improved mildly. DREAMING OF FRANK raced toward the rear three wide, was pushed along while still racing three wide around the
bend, and lacked the needed kick four wide in the lane. SEQUINS STORM bobbled in the opening strides, tracked DOM THE BOMB two wide on the turn
though was gradually outpaced by him, came into the lane between horses and weakened. GENTLEMAN RICHIE settled toward the rear, raced in the three
path on the turn, and came up empty inside in the lane. PETEIZUM raced toward the rear between horses and offered no bid in the lane. BOSTON
CHARLEY tracked the leading pair in the four path on the turn and weakened two wide in the lane.

outside in the final furlong, drifted in near the sixteenth poll and pulled clear from there. LOST IN MANHATTAN tracked the leaders between horses up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began an inside bid approaching the quarter pole, and gained ground on the rail throughout the stretch to
settle for second best. BEST YOU EVER SEEN dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, led the field
into the stretch, steadied slightly at the sixteenth pole when MALIGATOR drifted into his path and was caught late. TORNADO BOY raced in the middle of
the pack on the inside early, navigated the turn from the three path and improved position in late stretch. ROAD GAME hit the gate at the break, tracked the
frontrunners between horses through the opening half mile, raced in the three path around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and chased the
frontrunners home, getting outkicked late. TETSU raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and flattened
out in the final furlong. DARK WOOD (IRE) raced off the pace on the outside in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the three path, swung wide into
the stretch and made no bid. WARRIORS GEM raced outside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, moved up to challenge the frontrunners from the
four path approaching the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. TALKING ZIP tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, raced into tight quarters entering the stretch and faded. GRAND LITTLE MAN raced off the pace on the inside throughout, saved ground
around the turn and never fired. NO BOUNDARIES dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the turn and tired

Footnotes
CAN'T HIDE FROM ME set a pressured pace inside of STORMINSIDE down the stretch and through the turn, cleared the rest of the field along with his
closest pursuer while saving ground around the bend, cleared into the lane and gradually increased his advantage while kept to the task. STORMINSIDE
came away sharply, pressed outside of CAN'T HIDE FROM ME down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, proved no match into the lane, and
chased on second best while racing well off the inside. NO CENTS LEFT soon trailed, took closer order between horses on the turn, was urged four wide
into the lane, and rallied to prove best of the rest. SEBA'S DANCER chased two wide early, saved ground through the turn, and chased on mildly inside in
the lane. FORGOT TO FORGET settled near the rear inside of CHLOBEE early, raced three wide in the rear group on the turn, swung seven wide to upper
stretch, and offered a belated outside rally. OFFLEE FUN tracked the pace inside of CHERNYAHOVSKIY down the backstretch, chased well behind the
leading pair in the two path on the turn, continued to chase into upper stretch while proving no match for that leading pair, and flattened out in the final
furlong. CHERNYAHOVSKIY was pushed along for early pace, tracked the leading pair outside of OFFLEE FUN, chased the leading pair in the four path
between horses on the turn, flattened out past the three eighths, came three wide into the lane, and was no further threat. TWO PAIR chased midpack,
continued in the two to three path while urged on the turn, came into the lane between horses, and had no kick. GO FOR SHERRIE settled at the rear of the
main group inside of ROLL CALL, continued at the inside of the rear group while saving ground through the turn, was driven inside into the lane, and had no
response. CHLOBEE raced two wide toward the rear early, bid outside past the nine sixteenths, advanced to midfield into the turn, chased in the six path on
the bend, floated six wide into the lane, bumped with ROLL CALL in upper stretch, and weakened. ROLL CALL settled at the rear of the main group outside
of GO FOR SHERRIE early, bid three wide past the five eighths, chased the leading pair in the five path on the turn, leveled out past the three eighths,
floated five wide into the lane, bumped with CHLOBEE in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
UNSCATHED was hustled for speed, set the pace in the two path on the turn while headstrong, cleared when urged in upper stretch, continued to increase
his advantage while driven to the final sixteenth, was put in hand and only shown the crop late once the affair was decided, and crossed the wire in track
record time. CAN'T SAY NO tracked outside of CREAL WONDER, raced in range on the three path on the turn, could not match UNSCATHED into the
lane, and chased on second best under a drive. CREAL WONDER was bumped by CHRISTMAS COOKIE in the opening strides, tracked the pace inside of
CAN'T SAY NO, saved ground through the turn while tracking the leading pair, chased along the inside down the lane, weakened in the final furlong but
salvaged the show. RIO SECO chased three wide, went to a drive in upper stretch while still three wide, kept on between horses and narrowly missed the
show. IWILLPERSEVERE settled near the rear, was urged between horses on the turn, came into the lane in the rear flight between horses, came out near
midstretch and forced DIAMOND MAXIMUS out as a result, and made a belated outside rally. DIAMOND MAXIMUS was bumped by SUPRISE CAT in the
opening strides, settled near the rear outside of IWILLPERSEVERE, raced three wide in the rear group on the turn and into the lane, was carried out slightly
by IWILLPERSEVERE near midstretch, and rallied belatedly outside. OUR THOMAS trailed down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, shifted
three wide in upper stretch, and passed tired horses. DEMAND RANSOM chased two wide early, continued well behind the leading trio three wide on the

Footnotes
MUSIC CITY STAR hit the gate leaving it, recovered to lead the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and
held off a late closer under a drive to save the win. KATIE M'LADY tracked the leader on the inside in the early going, angled out to launch a bid from the
three path approaching the quarter pole, and closed the distance between herself and the winner down the lane. AMERICAN BOURBON raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the three sixteenths
pole and gained ground on the outside in late stretch. SCENT OF SUCCESS raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, began her bid nearing the three sixteenths pole and improved position on the rail in the final furlong. CAT ATTACK hopped up leaving the
gate, raced at the back of the pack in the opening stages, came around the turn in the two path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. PRINCESS STELLA
(IRE) pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch in the two path and weakened in the final furlong. READY
AT MIDNIGHT raced off the pace on the inside in the early going, came around the turn in the two path and improved position in the stretch while never
threatening. TIZ A QUEEN raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and made no bid. ABBMAR raced in
the middle of the pack on the outside early, came around the turn in the three path, and faded in the stretch. SHE'S MY RIDE broke with the field, dropped
back quickly to trail far behind the field up the backstretch and around the turn, saved ground throughout and kept on in the stretch to catch the back of the
field. DARE TO HOPE raced between horses in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired entering the stretch.
Race was hand timed.
