Footnotes
LOST IN ROME bumped at the start by MAGIC MOJO due to pressure inside from THIS ILL DEFEND, established the front shortly after the start and
showed the way just off the inside through the first turn before tucking closer to the rail down the backstretch while under rating through sensible splits,
remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive inching away to the eighth
pole, was under late threat from a pair and held safe to prevail. MAGIC MOJO bumped at the start by LOKOYA ROAD due to pressure from THIS ILL
DEFEND, who broke outwards, raced two to three wide through the opening bend, tracked the front from just off the pace just off the inside, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive threatening through the final eighth while running on but was
ultimately rebuffed to the finish. THIS ILL DEFEND broke out at the start bumping LOKOYA ROAD into MAGIC MOJO and in turn LOST IN ROME, tracked
the pace along the inside under rating, had a firm near side grip applied into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper
stretch in behind the eventual winner and lacked optimal clearance, gained that clearance and was unable to catch the seam inside the eighth pole, then got
driven behind the winner to the finish briefly tepid at the sixteenth marker while ultimately repelled and along for the show honors. LOKOYA ROAD got
bumped between foes at the start due to mostly pressure from THIS ILL DEFEND, raced just off the inside through the first turn, chased two then three
wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kept on through to the wire. FEELING DANGEROUS struck the off
side stall at the start, raced along the inside through the first turn before tipping three wide down the backstretch, chased three to four wide through the far
turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. STONECASTLE chased along the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

up the pressure on the leader, took the advantage under a right-handed whip into upper stretch, fought outside of the runner-up under a continued
right-handed whip into the final furlong, shook clear outside the sixteenth-pole then drifted in and was placed under a hand ride in the final seventy yards

pace between horses, vied in the two to three path early on the turn, dropped back passing the three-eighths, chased into the stretch and proved no match
for the top two but determinedly earned the show. DREAMONMEBABY moved up under urging then settled just off the pace, was roused while saving
ground on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, fought with two foes for the show and just missed that position while narrowly able to get the last
spot in the superfecta. BREES BAYOU was well placed just off the pace, came under urging while three then four wide on the turn, chased into upper
stretch, proved no match for the top two, fought with two rivals for the minor awards and just missed the superfecta. BETTS hit the inside of the gate at the

SIMPLY RAVISHING away in good order, assumed a forward position, prompted CON LIMA from path two, saw the pilot still holding something back taking
control in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, went onward for another furlong before getting asked for more, responded, was in possession of a healthy
advantage when geared down for the final seventy yards. CON LIMA left the post parade early, out-broke the competition and retained the advantage, got
guided over to the inside route, was lightly hand urged showing the way, feeling pressure from the top one all the while, relinquished despite being roused in
the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, cut the corner into the lane, fell back steadily, stayed on for second. UNION GABLES scurried to the outside
after brushing twice with THURSDAY at the conclusion of the chute, took up the chase two to three wide on the turn, was more the latter spinning into the
stretch, proved no match. THURSDAY bumped lightly two times with UNION GABLES as they twosome approached the top of the backstretch, went on to
hug the rail until the quarter pole, was maneuvered four wide from the top of the lane to midstretch, had no response.

Footnotes
MASHNEE GIRL showed good speed, set the pace with company to her outside, vied inside a foe while along the rail on the turn, was given her cue inside
the five-sixteenths, shook clear in upper stretch, responded well when put to a right-handed whip inside the furlong marker, was given one last crack of the
whip at the sixteenth-pole then placed under a hand ride to the wire while best. BIG TIME LADY brushed with a foe at the start and bobbled, moved in early
then was rated just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, shifted three wide while roused for more into the stretch, came
under the whip inside the three-sixteenths, pursued the winner in the final furlong and was second best. CARA'S DREAMER hesitated at the start,
established a good position just off the pace, moved out from behind horses near the half-mile pole, went three wide on the far turn, was roused outside the
five-sixteenths, came under the whip outside the quarter-pole, chased four wide into the stretch and weakened but earned the show. SWEETER pressed
the pace on the outside, vied in the two path while outside of the winner on the turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back under the whip in
upper stretch and tired. MENDHAM broke in slightly then was hustled, moved out near the three-quarter pole, was coaxed along on the outside, went four
wide under strong encouragement on the turn, was put to the whip outside the five-sixteenths then driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty.
HOT DAME ran off with the rider with his feet out of the irons in the post parade, was jostled by the pony of the outrider when pulled up near the
three-sixteenths marker on the main track, bobbled just after the start, settled towards the rear, dropped back late on the backstretch, went around the turn
in the two path, turned into the stretch under a drive and showed little. CONSTITUTIONALRAGE brushed with a rival at the start then stumbled, spotted the
front a couple of lengths, raced towards the rear on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, went five wide while falling well behind on the turn
and was no factor while coasting home without encouragement.

Footnotes
OFFICER HUTCHY was allowed to ease back into a stalking role after narrowly out-breaking the competition, sat perched three wide keeping an eye on the
front runners, swung into the lane within striking distance, arrived at the three-sixteenths pole and was given her cue, hitched up to SPIN A YARN, sparking
off a tussle between them the rest of the way home, whittled away at the deficit, snatched away the lead for good in the final seventy yards and edged away.
SPIN A YARN briefly spotted along the rail, shifted into the two path once BIG Q herself set up residence along the inside route early on the backstretch,
was rated along thereafter pressing the issue, got called upon coming up the three-sixteenths pole, wrested away the lead in short order, hobbled onward
springing from the eighth pole, having failed to switch to the proper lead, yielded well inside the sixteenth marker, had enough to save second. THE
IMPORTANT ONE left the post parade early, proceeded to break from the gate without apparent mishap, settled into midpack, departed the backstretch
from the two path, got set down right around the five-sixteenths pole, fanned out five wide from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, flashed late
foot en route for the show. BIG Q cut over to the rail early on the backstretch once sufficiently in the clear, was lightly hand urged setting the pace,
shadowed by the second place finisher out in path two, felt an uptick in pressure nearing the head of the stretch in the form of the eventual winner, saw the
rider resort to stronger handling, yielded quickly, tired in the final furlong. NICKY SCISSORS slid over to the inside at the midway point on the backstretch,
contently tracked the front runners, came into the lane, went down it between path two and the rail, had no rally. HOLMDEL PARK saved ground until the
end of the bend, angled three wide for the stretch run, lacked an offering. MANI PEDI worked out a tuck into the two path at the half mile pole, got put to a
drive a furlong later, tipped out four wide into upper stretch, made no headway, prior to being placed to a protective hold and allowed to back away more
readily.

to hold for the place honors. STEFANIE ON FLEEK three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide into
upper stretch and improved position to procure the show honors. SKY KITTEN just off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tipped four wide through
the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths to the inside of TEAM WIN, swung three to four wide for home and weakened. RUVIES IN TIME

Footnotes
PALACE AVENGER was hustled to the lead, set the pace on the inside of a foe while well out in the track, dropped in leaving the backstretch, vied in the
two to three path on the turn, responded well when asked once straightened for the drive, was put to a right-handed whip just after shaking clear coming to
the furlong marker and extended the advantage under steady urging to prove much the best. SPANISH POINT broke in and bumped with a foe then was
pulled off that rival with a hard tug of the right rein, pressed the pace on the far outside, vied in the three to four path on the turn, was asked near the
five-sixteenths, came under the whip in upper stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while able to hold the place.
FAIR REGIS was bumped on both sides at the start and shut-off then pinched back, moved in while off the pace, advanced closer along the rail on the turn,
was asked while cutting the corner into the stretch, chased under the whip into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while just able to get the show.
KEPT TRUE broke out and bumped with an opponent, tracked the pace on the inside of a rival while outside of the leader, dropped back a bit near the
half-mile pole then moved out into the turn, went four to five wide on that bend, made a brief bid under a right-handed whip in upper stretch, dropped back
into the final furlong and just missed the show. SLIMEY settled well back on the outside under some urging, came under stronger encouragement while two
to three wide on the turn, angled out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. JC'S SHOOTING STAR settled well back in the field, saved
ground under urging on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and was no factor.

FOXTAIL broke on top, proceeded along two to three wide on the clubhouse eyeing NIKO'S DREAM, had no difficulty wresting away the advantage as the
second split was being posted, settled into a snug fit on path two by the commencement of the run around the far turn, effortlessly lengthened away during
the final sixteenth leading up to the quarter pole, swung slightly wider into the lane, switched leads when instructed in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths
pole, won handily as much the best. NIKO'S DREAM vied inside the winner for three-quarters, went into the stretch and easily procured the place. TASS
fidgeting about prior to this trio being released, came away the tardiest after striking the right side of the gate, underwent a three to two wide journey, failed
to pick it up when asked early on the second bend, stepped into the lane and ventured onward for the show award,.

MY SWEET WIFE brushed the near side stall at the start, chased three wide from near the rear under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command just outside the sixteenth pole, then inched away to the finish to prevail.
HALO CITY chased three to four wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn advancing to take command five-sixteenths from
home, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, came inwards near the eighth pole before drifting out slightly inside that station, got collared just outside the
sixteenth marker and kept on clear for the place honors. HARLEM HEIGHTS stumbled at the start getting away last and conceding two to three lengths to
the front, chased just off the inside from the tail of the field, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. YES TO MISCHIEF showed the way in hand along the inside coming under
coaxing when under pressure near the five-sixteenths, yielded at that station, cut the corner into upper stretch back to near even terms straightened away
and weakened. MS BOOMBASTIC chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under a ride at the seven-sixteenths, spun
three wide into upper stretch and tired. ANYTHING GOES showed brief speed just off the inside down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the half mile
pole as HALO CITY tucked in front from the outside, faded through the turn, swung three wide for home and tired.
