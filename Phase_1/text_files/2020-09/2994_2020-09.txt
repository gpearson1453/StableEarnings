out to the wire, in command throughout. KENAI COOL raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the turn, launched a bid between horses
passing the three sixteenths pole and chased the winner home from there. LADY EXPRESS raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came
around the turn in the three path and gained some ground on the outside in late stretch. DEVIL'S ROSE broke slowly, trailed the field on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and began a late inside run to improve position in the final furlong. MY FOUROONE KPLAN raced in the middle
of the pack early, navigated the turn from the three path, raced evenly in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. LOVE BROKE THRU trailed the
field on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and flattened out from there. ROCKET

Footnotes
DO WITH PRIDE stalked outside and just behind the pacesetter, encroached on him near the eleven sixteenths, continued in close range whole two wide
through the far turn, saw the leader inch slightly away in upper stretch but stayed on in the lane, took the lead outside him approaching the sixteenth pole,
and held. READTHECLIFFNOTES tracked the leading pair three wide, lost a bit of position in upper stretch while still three wide, rallied under a drive,
gained to the wire but just missed. FADE AWAY tracked the leading pair between horses early, settled midfield for the backstretch run, came in on
ANTRIM'S GIANT while racing into the far turn, chased in the two path on the far turn, saved ground into the lane, proved no match for the leading pair in
the final furlong but kept on two wide between horses to prove narrowly best of the rest. CROW MOON was hustled out to the lead, set the pace, took some
pressure from DO WITH PRIDE near the eleven sixteenths but continued to set the pace while saving ground through the far turn and into the lane, was
headed with a sixteenth of a mile remaining and weakened inside. DOLLAR BLUE chased three wide through the clubhouse turn, continued two wide in
midfield down the backstretch, improved position between horses on the far turn, kept on three wide in the stretch but was outkicked for show. FIRST
MASAMUNE chased between horses through the far turn, was wrangled back to second last into the backstretch, was pushed along three wide into the far
turn, swung four wide under a drive into the lane, rallied four to five wide but missed the show. NEVER EVEN CALLED came out and bumped SKYCRAFT
in the opening strides, raced at the inside of the chasing flight, continued in the two path on the far turn, was taken out three wide into the stretch, rallied
three and then four wide, but was outfinished for the show. SKYCRAFT was bumped in the opening strides by NEVER EVEN CALLED, trailed through the
first turn and down the backstretch, raced between horses in the rear flight on the far turn and into the lane, and had no rally. ANTRIM'S GIANT raced at the
inside of the tracking flight, began to lose ground inside past the half mile mark, took up sharply near the seven sixteenths when FADE AWAY came in,
continued to lose position inside through the far turn and was no factor in the lane.

backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path nearing the three eighths pole and weakened in the final furlong. WHY WHY PAUL WHY brushed
with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, saved ground
around the far turn and made no bid. VIOLATOR veered out and brushed the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field from the rail
around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch. BABA LOU trailed the field from the three
path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BUSHROD tracked the leading trio, bid inside of JIVE DADDY on the far turn, took the lead past the three eighths, took command in upper stretch, and held
clear while kept to the task. GREY MASK was bumped by J Z'S LAST TRY in the opening strides, also bumped TWO PAIR in the opening strides, chased
two wide into the turn, improved inside of the tracking flight into the lane, could not cut into BUSHROD's lead in the lane but kept on well enough to hold the
place. JEGGYJEGGY chased midpack early, was pushed along into the turn but lost position, saved ground toward the rear around the bend, came into the
lane under a drive inside, rallied in upper stretch, but did not have enough in the final furlong to capture the place. J Z'S LAST TRY broke out and bumped
GREY MASK in the opening strides, was wrangled to the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, swung out six wide into the lane, and rallied five wide in
the final furlong. BOOM BOX was fractious in the gate, raced at the inside near the rear early, was pushed along between horses on the turn, swung four
wide into the lane, and kept on mildly. ARTEGON disputed the pace outside of JIVE DADDY, had no response when BUSHROD bid for the lead past the
five sixteenths, came three wide into the lane, chased to midstretch, and weakened three wide. TWO PAIR was bumped by GREY MASK in the opening
strides, raced two wide near the rear on the backstretch, continued near the rear three wide around the bend, swung five wide into the lane, got relegated to
last in upper stretch but passed tiring horses under a drive late. MONGOL BULL raced at the inside of the leading flight in the opening furlong but allowed to
settle back to chase midfield along the inside into the turn, swung three wide into the lane under a drive, but came up empty. PABLO DEL MONTE stalked
outside the leading pair down the backstretch, continued in close range four wide on the turn, and emptied out in the lane. JIVE DADDY disputed the pace
inside of ARTEGON, had no answer for BUSHROD when he took over past the five sixteenths, turned for home between horses, and was allowed to
weaken in the lane. This race was hand timed,

Footnotes
SMOKIN' JAY led the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and extended his lead down the lane,
winning handily. HIPPIE COWGIRL raced outside in the middle of the pack early, navigated the turn from the four path, began a wide bid approaching the
quarter pole, and gained ground on the outside, settling for second best. WISE KHOZAN bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced off the
pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and improved position between horses in the final furlong. MKAR THE FAST
hopped up leaving the break, raced off the pace between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the four path and made a
mild gain of ground in the stretch. KENNESAW stumbled slightly and bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to race between
horses in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid between horses near the five sixteenths pole,
chased the frontrunner in upper stretch and weakened late. TWO COOKIE RULE bumped with the horse to his outside and then veered sharply inside at
the break, raced just off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, launched a mild bid entering the stretch and flattened out
from there. DEJOHN veered in leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and made no bid. HAVE A
NOTION chased the leader up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, moved up to challenge nearing the quarter pole and tired in the
stretch. MACHO CLASSIC raced off the pace on the outside early, came around the turn in the three path and was never a factor.

the lead in the two path as LEMON BLITZ and NO BOUNDARIES encroached around the far turn, kicked clear when asked into the lane, and kept on under
a hand ride in the final furlong. LEMON BLITZ tracked the leader, encroached to his outside into the far turn, stalked between horses around that bend,
could not match CONTRACTION into the lane, but kept on best of the rest and held the place. UNITE THE MASSES soon trailed, improved two wide into
the second turn, came into the lane under a drive in the three path, was taken to the outside, rallied, and missed the place. ROAR OF THE LION tracked the
leading pair inside of horses through the clubhouse turn, continued to chase inside foes down the backstretch, was pushed along at the inside of the
chasing flight on the far turn, kept on to midstretch while no match for the winner, and was outfinished in the final furlong. TETSU chased between horses,
was urged into the lane while still between horses, and lacked the needed kick. NO BOUNDARIES was away slowest, advanced to chase four wide through
the clubhouse turn, pulled three wide into the backstretch, bid three wide into the far turn and stalked three wide around that bend, proved no match for
CONTRACTION into the lane, and emptied out in the final furlong. DONIVAN MY BOY chased three wide while rank through the first turn, continued to
chase three wide down the backstretch and through the second turn, came into the lane three wide under a drive and mustered no bid. AL TAWEEL settled
near the rear inside, continued to save ground in the rear flight around the far turn, and made no rally.

RICHIESGOTGAME raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside, began a bid from the three path nearing the
three eighths pole, angled over in upper stretch to take the lead from the inside and pulled clear in the final furlong. DEWY'S HIT broke quickly, angled in to
save ground around the first turn, led the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn, and was caught while drifting out mildly in the
stretch, proving to be the best of the rest. ROYAL KITTEN saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated
the far turn from the two path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and chased the leaders home, no match for the top two.. BRAVO BRAVO was reluctant
to load, broke well and raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the frontrunner up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and was
outkicked in the stretch. DUCKDEVIL brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch off the pace, began to move up from the two path around the turn and gained ground mildly in the stretch. LORING PARK broke slowly, was
carried out five wide around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the
stretch. DELFT BLUE drifted out to the four path around the first turn, carrying LORING PARK with him, trailed the field up the backstretch on the inside,
raced in the two path around the far turn and came up empty in the stretch. Z U AT THE RACES raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the
backstretch off the pace, continued around the far turn still in the two path and weakened in the stretch. FRANK THE TANK brushed with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, continued around the far turn on the rail and
faded in the stretch. MANGO TREE hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the four path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch on the
inside, navigated the far turn from the three path and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
CHARLIE'S PENNY came away with the leading flight, disputed the early pace inside of GRAPEVINE, pressed inside of BLONDE ON TAP once that one
took initiative into the turn while still racing comfortably, took the lead near the five sixteenths without being asked, opened up in upper stretch and won as
she pleased. MY BOSS LADY settled toward the rear, raced in the four to five path on the turn, floated five wide into the lane, and rallied with good interest
outside to prove second best. JOAN'S WAY broke in and bumped SUGAR DIVA in the opening strides, settled toward the rear, began to improve in the two
path past the three eighths, split horses approaching the quarter pole, swung four wide in upper stretch, and kept on to seize the show late. SUGAR DIVA
was bumped by JOAN'S WAY in the opening strides and then bumped GRAPEVINE, was urged between horses on the turn, improved position inside
horses into the lane, proved no match for CHARLIE'S PENNY in upper stretch, and was outfinished in the final furlong. GRAPEVINE was bumped by
SUGAR DIVA in the opening strides, disputed the early pace outside of CHARLIE'S PENNY, settled back behind that foe and BLONDE ON TAP into the
turn, chased them in the three path, was urged three wide in upper stretch, but did not have enough in the final furlong. BULU bumped the gate on the way
out and came inward in the opening strides, soon trailed, was urged in the two to three path on the turn, and offered a mild gain in the lane. SHE'S A BIG
STAR chased well behind the leading trio, chased three wide as the middle of the field contracted near the five sixteenths, came three wide into the lane,
and proved no threat. TIZ A QUEEN came away slowly, pulled to midfield into the turn, was urged while chasing three to four wide around the bend,
continued to improve position in upper stretch, and weakened. READY AT MIDNIGHT settled in second last, raced in the six path on the turn, floated into
the lane in the nine path, and lacked the needed rally. LADY TIME chased inside of DARE TO HOPE early, saved ground through the turn, came into the
lane under a drive inside, but had no response. BLONDE ON TAP was forward early, engaged three wide past the half mile mark and took the lead into the
turn, was pushed along on a narrow lead outside of CHARLIE'S PENNY, had no answer when she took the lead at the five sixteenths, and weakened
between horses down the lane. DARE TO HOPE was reluctant to load and fractious in the gate, chased midpack, raced five wide on the turn, began to
weaken past the three eighths, was driven into the lane in the eight path and proved empty.
