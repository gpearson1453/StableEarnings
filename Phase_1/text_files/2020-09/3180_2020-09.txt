Footnotes
PRECIOUS ARCH stalked the pace early four wide, made a bid to take command past the five sixteenths pole, then was headed entering the stretch,
moved over to the inside leaving the eighth pole, then came again the final sixteenth to get up under a drive. PABLO'S MINX chased the early pace, made a
five wide bid on the turn, gained a short advantage at the furlong marker under right handed encouragement, then switched to left handed stick urging
leaving the eighth pole, but lost the whip shortly after, hung late to be caught at wire. MUSICAL LADY was allowed to settle early in between rivals, came
into the stretch four wide but offered no significant rally while besting the rest. I JUANA HERO dueled for the lead on the inside then weakened. CROSSED
THE LINE had no rally while racing wide and greenly. PURE AIR HAVANA lacked a rally while saving ground. CRYPTOMNESIA dueled for the early leas
three wide then faltered.

Footnotes
BIRDIE BLUE was well rated early while three wide, made a four wide sweep on the far turn to assume command, drew off in the stretch to prove much the
best under mild encouragement. IRENE was five wide early, then advanced on the turn while four wide past the quarter pole, but proved to be no match for
the winner while clearly second best. WICKED WAYS dueled for the early lead and was two wide past the seven sixteenths pole, then moved over to the rail
on the turn while weakening, held show spot. BROOKVILLE STORM stalked the early pace on the inside, checked on the rail entering the far turn by the
seven sixteenths pole, then steadied while lacking room by the five sixteenths pole, swung out four wide for the drive but offered no rally. JUST HUMMING
was allowed to settle early, swung out six wide for the drive but had no rally. CUTIE PIE dueled for the early lead three wide then weakened. The stewards
posted the INQUIRY into the running around the seven sixteenths pole, after reviewing the video replays they determined that WICKED WAYS be
disqualified for third and placed fourth.

Footnotes
ROB THE RICH broke outwardly a tad at the start, pressed the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid in hand past the seven sixteenths pole to
quickly assume command, then drew out to prove much the best under right handed stick encouragement. LAVERY dueled for the early lead on the inside,
then eased out three wide by the quarter pole, but could not go with the winner while clearly second best. ROUGHIN THE CITY was allowed to settle early,
then was four wide past the quarter pole, angled in in the stretch to be up for the show late. DODGER chased the early pace four wide and faded, losing the
show in the final hundred yards. CHASING ANNA dueled for the early lead and was in between rivals leaving the half mile pole then faltered. CYBIL failed to
menace.

Footnotes
MISS DEPUTY STAR set a pressured pace on the inside, dug in gamely in the stretch to prevail late while all out. TIMELESS GLORY was well rated early
while three wide, then came into the stretch four wide and was slowly gaining late. A TOUCH OF JUSTICE pressed the pace three wide and hung late after
a long drive, lost place late. HARLANS PRINCESS was allowed to settle early and was four wide past the quarter pole, then drifted in slightly past the eighth
pole under left handed urging, then was blocked in deep stretch while gaining. MISS INHOFE was well placed towards the inside but lacked the needed
winning stretch bid. BIG IF TRUE was allowed to settle while three to four wide throughout and raced evenly. IMA BARREL RACER failed to menace. REVS
RUN broke in tangle at the start, no threat. FOUND MY MAN was four wide early, then crossed over to the rail on the turn and tired. THE LAST FLING
checked after the start, stopped.

Footnotes
SCARLET CITY was rated early and raced five wide on the backstretch, made a four wide bid on the second turn, drew clear entering the stretch then drew
off to prove much the best under a drive. I'M AN EIGHT was allowed to settle towards the inside, had to move two wide to move around a tiring rival on the
second turn, then finished well to gain the place on the inside. FADE AWAY was void of early speed towards the inside, angled out seven wide at the top of
the stretch for racing room to offer a belated rally. SEA ADMIRAL vied for the lead three wide, then dueled with the winner past the quarter pole, but faded in
deep stretch. BIZERK chased the early pace and made a mild bid four wide past the three eighths pole but was empty. FIREWATER JAKE was bumped at
the start, had a four wide trip while offering no rally. EVIL EYE was bumped at the start then proved to be no factor. STEWARDS RULES was hard used
early to vie for the lead on the inside then stopped after a half mile. WITCH DOCTOR tired.
