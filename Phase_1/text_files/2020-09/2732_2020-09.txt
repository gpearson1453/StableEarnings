Footnotes
CIRCLE AWAY was unhurried from the gate, saved ground to the far turn, went quickest moving past foes, continued advancing in the lane and led past the
eighth pole, clearing off. LIZZY'S LURE was bumped at the start, traveled off the leader's flank, took the lead at the top of the far turn, angled out in deep
stretch and had late pace but had no impact on the winner. GIANT TRICK was bumped at the start, had the lead off the rail, lost the lead on the far turn and
kept on for third while no match for the winner. JENNYSREGALMAN took the five path around the first turn, tracked the top pair ealy, lost ground on the far
turn but improved position in the stretch. PRIMED FOR TALENT ran in the four path on the first turn, stayed near the back of a compact field, lost position
on the far turn and passed a tired foe late. RIKER went to the three path on the first turn, raced mid pack, was urged on the far turn, came into the stretch in
the five path and tired.

Footnotes
STATESBORO stayed within range, rallied in the two path on the turn, continued down the lane, split horses midway and battled on to secure the win.
KEYED ON TOP tracked to the turn, moved up from there, was game late but needed more kick while settling for second. LEO raced off the lead, raliied in
the four path on the turn, had pace down the lane and showed courage late for third. SMOLTZ showed speed to the stretch and gave way at the sixteenth
pole while on the rail. GOT THE NOTION was patient at the rear, went from off the rail on the turn and needed more rally in the stretch. IN A FOG was
restrained early, lacked room and steadied going into the far turn, came into the stretch in the four path and flattened out. WILLY I AM was the inside speed
to the turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
GRACE D' ART raced as inside speed, came out into the stretch in the four path, angled back inside in upper stretch and was able to fend off a foe late to
hold the win. DUNWOODY chased the pace early, moved closer while on the rail in the turn, made a rail run down the stretch to make a late bid, angled out
at the sixteenth pole but lacked the needed rally to catch the winner. MIRIANA'S QUEEN raced off the rail while off the pace and held posiiton late. FOR
HOME was bothered at the start, raced well off the pace, had some rally on the turn and improved position in the stretch. STREET QUEEN prompted the
pace from the outside to the stretch and was out of gas at the eighth pole. BOO HAWK steadied a bit at the start and was no threat. The rider of
DUNWOODY objected to alledged interference by GRACE D'ART in the stretch but the claim was disallowed by the stewards and the order of finish stood
as is.

SISTER'S CREED broke sharp, opened up a clear lead and was never threatened. MARKET SUCCESS was bumped and steadied at the start, raced
unhurried to the turn, rallied from mid turn, came widest into the stretch and closed best past the sixteenth pole. FORTUNATE GINA broke inward, was a
clear third to the turn and ran evenly late for the show spot. CONJURING was bothered at the start,, stalked a clear leader and faltered late. DOLLY DEAR
was mid pack in a strung out field, rallied on the rail in the stretch, loomed a threat but tired the final eighth. ROCKY PARADE was no threat.

DETERMINATOR tracked just off rail first turn, set to drive far turn and all out to last in the final stages. GABE'S FLAG speed to the front, well handled
throughout while determined to wire but outfinished. VALYCOVE perfect spot throughout, running well to the finish with a good, nice effort. SPEED
GRACER raced off rail throughout, four or five wide into stretch and ran on mildly through the final furlong. ALL HANDS ON DECK reserved throughout,
bothered first turn, checked up again late. GEH SCHNELL raced a wide trip throughout, mildly in the stretch run. SPRING SOLO off rail throughout, close up
to stretch, faltered in the drive. PURR CAT never a real factor. FRED'S COUNTRY BOY jumped a shadow first turn, lost stride moment and had an, eventful
trip through the stretch run also.

TEMPLEMENT raced mid pack, moved past foes in the three path on the turn, led by mid turn and opened up. SWEET CARLI was off slow, chased the
winner on the turn, was game but second best. KISS OF DAHPESPE was the speed to the turn from off the rail, lost the lead there and leveled out to settle
for show. BOOTS N' BATTLE stumbled at the start, was well back early, took the three path on the turn and improved position in the stretch. CORA ANNE
was up close early, dropped back on the turn and came widest into the stretch. PROMISED FAME tracked from the inside, pulled up at the eighth pole and
walked across the wire.
