Footnotes
STILL CHIEF stalked the early pace three wide while in hand, then made a bid past the quarter pole when ready, drew off smartly to prove much the best
under a drive. ITS JUST FATE set the early pace while two wide, was headed at the top of the stretch and proved to be no match for the winner, second
best. ROOSTER broke outwardly at the start, chased the pace while four wide, sent down past the quarter pole while four wide but lacked the needed rally
while besting the rest. UNBRIDLED BOILER was reserved early, eased out on the turn and came into the stretch five wide to offer a belated rally.
JOHNSTOWN JOHNNY chased the early pace from in between rivals then weakened. IN A WHILE chased the early pace from the inside then stopped.

CAFE MISCHIEF vied inside, lost the lead, then came back on the rail to be up in time. PERSONALLY raced four wide, rallied late and missed. RUN LIKE
REV pressed the early pace in the three path, bid at the three-eighths pole to be clear but was outfinished. MY DISCREET SECRET saved ground to no
avail. MAGNA G FORCE raced in the two path, moved out four wide in the stretch for a mild late bid. EVALUVNMACHINE raced in the five path with no late
bid. GOTTAGOTOGETMYDO pressed the early pace between foes, bore out at the quarter pole and gave way. Due to a timer malfunction, internal
fractions were omitted and the final was hand timed. Race times determined following video review.

FLOWERPECKER set the pace from the inside, repulsed multiple bids past the quarter pole, then held sway late to prove best, driving. YOU GO BOY
pressed the early three wide, then found himself in between rivals past the quarter pole, was shuffled back entering the stretch, angled out in mid stretch for
racing room, then closed well late. JOVA was bumped at the start, then chased the early pace on the inside, was boxed past the quarter pole while still
inside, then finished well late on the inside to get the show award late. LITTLE KANSAS was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the far turn
to vie for the lead, but was unable to sustain that bid, hung late. PLAINFIELD chased the early pace three wide, made a bid in between rivals past the
quarter pole, but flattened out in the final furlong. WHOLELOTACHOCOLATE broke outwardly at the start bumping a rival, then was not a factor.

ALWAYSBEHUMBLE pressed the pace set three wide early, then rated off past the five sixteenths pole, then made a bid in the stretch while three wide,
wore down rival late to prove best, driving. TUFFER THAN TUFF set a pressured pace on the inside and shook clear on the turn, but could not hold off the
winner late, game effort. TOPPING chased the early pace and came into the stretch four wide but lacked the needed bid, held show. STORMY CACTUSA
lacked a serious rally. HOPPED UP was void of early speed, came wide into the stretch to offer a belated rally. R SOARING LIGHT was four wide early and
weakened. PRETTY BOY DAVE was bumped at the start, failed to menace. BLACK SPARTACUS showed brief foot from the inside then was through early.

AZIPASS vied for the early lead four wide, made a bid entering the far turn, drew clear while crossing over to the rail, then remained clear to prove much the
best while being kept to pressure. VALSHEBA tracked the early pace, then made a three wide bid on the far turn, continued on to grab the place award
while no match to the winner. BROOKVILLE STORM chased the early pace five wide, made a four wide bid on the far turn, but flattened out final furlong,
lost place late while besting the rest. BIG BLUE EMU vied for the early lead on the inside then weakened. STRONG ILLUSION vied for the early lead in
between rivals, fell back on the turn, angled out in the stretch but offered no bid. CECIL'S ANGEL was not a factor while three wide. QUITE WHIMSICAL
was not a factor while wide. BLU VIXEN was bumped at the start, failed to menace.

Footnotes
COLD HEARTED WENCH was reserved early, made a five sweep on the far turn to vie for command entering the stretch, drew clear in the final furlong to
prove much the best under a drive. STACK SHACK was well rated while saving ground on the backstretch, angled out for racing room entering the stretch
while making a bid, could not go with the winner late while second best. OMI TEN was away alertly to set the pace, gave way grudgingly the final furlong
while besting the rest. NOSTALGIA was well placed early, awaited room on the turn, then when roused entering the stretch but offered no punch. MISS
HATTIE was reserved early, made a inside bid entering the stretch but flattened out. IVORYSGOLDTREASURE was void of early speed, saved ground
entering the stretch but offered no rally. R U MIZZEN ME lacked a rally. BRATOUTTAHELL stumbled at the start, then went up to press the pace while three
wide, weakened. DIXIELAND TRAFFIC stalked the pace four wide then tired after six furlongs. POSH PRINCESS was not a factor while four wide.
TOUCHING THE SKY showed little.
