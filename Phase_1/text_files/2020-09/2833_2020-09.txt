Footnotes
ELDRITCH (IRE) tracked on the inside, moved up inside on the far turn, rallied two wide into the lane, dug in gamely outside of BOOTLEGGER (FR) and
wore down that rival late for the win. BOOTLEGGER (FR) set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, dug in gamely on the rail in the final
furlong and battled to the end. ALFRED raced off the pace inside, rallied mildly inside and got up for third. JUAN PABLO was off a bit slow, raced three wide
off the pace, went five wide past the quarter pole and gained mildly in the lane. NOBLE HOPE raced off the pace between rivals, advanced between horses
at the quarter pole, rallied and was outkicked for the minor awards. CHEYENNE BULL steadied in the chute, raced off the pace inside, moved up on the rail
on the far turn, checked at the quarter pole when lacking room, then raced on the rail in the stretch. SHOELESS raced two wide off the pace, went four wide
past the quarter pole and faded. CABINET PIK stalked outside, bid on the far turn and gave way.
