early, raced seven wide, was gaining late and finished second best. IMA SAINT TOO was unhurried early, went six wide into the turn and offered a mild late
rally. BULLY BABY set a pressured early pace from the inside and weakened. COMING ABSTRACTION was void of any early speed from between rivals
and finished belatedly. PUB was outrun early, went three wide and never fired. QUATRO tracked the early pace, went five wide and was empty. ONE MARK
was up close early, raced off the rail and faded. DAN WHO was taken back and was no threat. SILVER PONZI was always outrun.

Footnotes
AFRICAN FIGHTER was void of speed, circled seven wide through the second turn, was closing late, took control late and edged clear. KRISTO set a
pressured early pace from off the rail, opened up in early stretch, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. EMPEROR'S CHOICE pressed the
early pace, went five wide into the second turn and weakened late. SUPER ACCORD stalked the early pace, angled out six wide into the second turn and
was empty late. SURPRSINGLYPERFECT was allowed to settle early from between rivals and flattened out. SHARPSHOOTINGEORGE was void of any
early speed from the inside and had no rally. PASAMONTE MAN raced in mid pack early, went three wide into the second turn and never fired. TIZEZZY
was taken back and was no threat. HEREDITARY was reserved early and was no factor. HOWDY was not far back and was finished early.
