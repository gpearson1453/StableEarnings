Footnotes
FORT LEWIS RIVERS tracked dueling leaders outside of rival in the two path, entered turn two wide, made a bid for the lead approaching the eighth pole,
responded to urging and wore down leader in deep stretch. NOVA dueled inside of rival throughout the back stretch, maintained position through the turn
and into the stretch, responded to urging down the lane and caught late by surging rival. PAPA CABALLERO stalked pacesetters along the rail, stayed on
the rail throughout, responded well to urging in the stretch and finished a clear 3rd. MYSTIC GREY dueled outside of rival down the backstretch, entered
turn head and head with rival, started to lose the battle late in the turn and lacked needed response in the lane when asked.
