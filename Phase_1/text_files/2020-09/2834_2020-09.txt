Footnotes
SOPHIE RULES stalked early angling out into the turn wresting the lead there clearing in upper stretch digging in from the four path hanging on late.
LINDA'S MUSIC went evenly through the turn rallying along the inside in upper stretch pressing the winner late from the two path. TAPITTIZER R V F
stumbled at the break lagging well back early, rallied from the three path in upper stretch coming on to finish well. OUR MARIKKA gave a mild rally on the
turn going evenly through the lane in the six and seven paths. SLOWPOKE slow early was no factor racing six wide down the lane. MY BLACK BEAUTY
was never involved. CHINA DISH showed little. QUALITY H TWO O broke sharply to clear then ceded on the turn folding abruptly in upper stretch.
AWESOME EVIL gave way rapidly on the turn.
