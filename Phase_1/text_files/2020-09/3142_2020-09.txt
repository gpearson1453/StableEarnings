Footnotes
TEXAS REWARD tracked the pacesetter in the clear three wide, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole quickly drew off and widened through the
lane while ridden out. QUICKSTRIKE settled off the pace outside, raced four wide around the turn and rallied for the place. HIDEY HIDEY lacked early
speed, raced along the rail throughout and was along for the show. LADY QUINTESSA sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace in the two path and
tired in the drive. WIRETAP saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and never threatened. NOR PER OURS failed to menace while racing
three and four wide. WHO'S YOUR DADDY had some speed inside and steadily faded. TUA checked when shut off early, advanced outside into contention
down the backstretch, chased two wide around the turn and tired in the lane. MISS ROXY played no factor while racing three wide. CHANTAJE was outrun
while racing two and three wide.

MADAM MEENA set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. DANCER'S MELODY chased the pace two wide, was no match for the winner,
battled outside of QUIET IMAGINATION through the final furlong for the place and prevailed in that duel. QUIET IMAGINATION settled off the pace along
the inside, made progress in upper stretch, never threatened the winner, battled inside for the place and was outfinished. PINK CADDY raced off the pace
four wide and lacked a rally. CRAZY BEA failed to menace while racing two wide. MAP OF AMERICA prompted the pace three wide and tired in the lane.
STILL ALIVE was outrun in the three path. FIFTEEN ROYALS pressed the pace two wide and retreated in the lane.

STREET LUTE vied outside down the backstretch, drew clear two wide around the far turn and widened under moderate stretch urging. PLANE DRUNK
tracked the pace inside, angled three wide entering the turn, chased the winner from there, never threatened that foe and just lasted for the place.
HICKORY DICKORYDOC raced well back three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, rallied late and just missed second. JUROR NUMBER FOUR
chased two wide and was one-paced in the lane. HEART FULL OF SOUL vied inside of the winner down the backstretch, could not keep pace around the
turn, angled out near the five-sixteenths maker and faded. LAUGHIN' PLACE saved ground and failed to menace. ANGINETTI played no factor while racing
two wide. MAVILUS was outrun while racing three wide. TACTICAL PAJAMAS had some speed outside, was briefly forced out entering the turn, raced
three wide around most of the bend and faded. THEGODDESSOFSNAKES was outrun inside.

ARTFUL SPLATTER set a clear pace in two path drew off around the far turn and widened through the lane as the rider sat motionless until a congratulatory
pat in deep stretch. UJJAYI raced off the pace inside, steadied entering the first turn, angled out early on that bend, advanced between foes down the
backstretch, steadied off heels nearing the far turn, raced three wide around that turn and was along for the place. WILDCAT CARTRIDGE saved ground in
range early, dropped back around the far turn but stayed on to re-gain third late. B B'S BUSTED settled off the pace three wide, bid three wide into the far
turn, could not keep pace with the winner while under urging around the turn and came up empty. ITS A JOURNEY stalked the winner two and three wide
and had no response when roused on the far turn.

Footnotes
WILD ABOUT DEB settled off the pace inside, bid inside nearing the eighth pole, dueled through the final furlong and prevailed. BRANDT raced in range
three wide early, made a four wide bid into the far turn, took a narrow lead in upper stretch, dueled outside of foes through the lane and was narrowly
outfinished. MY FRIEND LINUS raced off the pace inside, went four wide around the far turn and rallied outside. PERFETTO set a pressured pace in the
two path, fought on between rivals through much of the lane and yielded late. TWIN VALOR rated between rivals when keen through the opening half, went
three wide around the far turn and finished evenly. BORSA VENTO was hustled early, pressed the pace three wide and gave way midway around the far
turn. SHOTMASTER failed to menace while racing two and three wide. MCLEAN HOUSE played no factor while racing three and four wide.
