Footnotes
TOMATER GATOR saved ground throughout, bid to the front into the far turn, vied through the turn and edged away in the stretch. DROSSELMAGIC vied
with the winner outside through the turn and weakened late. TRULY A MOON SHOT dropped back outside, raced wide throughout and lacked a bid. BRIO
MAN prompted the leaders three wide and began fading on the turn. INKY DINKY DO chased wide and was never a factor. ADULATION angled inside on
the turn but lacked a response. FIFTY sprinted clear in the opening quarter, bolted into the far turn losing any chance.aS PER RULING 20142PP from the
Pa. racing commission, DROSSELMAGIC was dq'ed for a positive test.

turn but then flattened out. MR. PEREZ stalked the early pace two wide then tired. LT. COLUMBO fell back after the start which was six minutes after post
time due to a slow gate load then never threatened. REFI bobbled after a slow start then failed to menace. EPIGRAMMATIST saved ground and tired.

TRUE UPGRADE saved ground throughout, bid to the front into the stretch and held on gamely in a tight finish. MIDNIGHT SKY lagged far behind then
closed with a rush very wide too late. MISS STAR LO prompted the pace outside, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. BAD NANA settled wide
just off the leaders, faded on the turn then came again. KNOCK OUT KID advanced in the two path on the turn and closed well inside. TOP HAT TIZZY
saved ground well off the pace, angled out in the stretch rallying. ENIGMATICA set a pressured pace inside rivals then stopped in the stretch.

SHORELINE, primed to roll after a long layoff, ran freely in front under rating, was roused sharply through mid stretch despite a huge lead and then was
taken in hand late MY MAN ELVIS, fractious in the gate and outrun for a half, split foes then moved out and was up for place. BRILLIANT WORTH chased
from the four path and was no match. PROUDMIAMICITIZEN saved ground early, drifted out through stretch and was no real threat. NONNO PIETRO,
between rivals, was never a serious threat. ELREGAL had his head turned to the left prior to the break and got off very slowly, trailed racing in the three
path and was no real threat. CITY GUY, three wide and just off the pace, stopped. MANAGING RISK, very wide, failed to menace. JOHNNY WISHBONE
showed nothing.

outside and began fading on the turn.

VICTORIA E came out after start and bumped BAYLEAF, never left the rail and edged away. ATLANTIC AVENUE was fanned out and bumped after the
start, challenged four wide on the turn and was up for place. LA FLAMENCA set the pace well off the rail, allowed winner to rally inside and gave way
grudgingly. MORISSETTE bumped and fanned out leaving gate, was very wide and just off the pace but had no rally. REIGNING FIRE saved ground and
showed little. BAAQEYA, wide, failed to menace. BAYLEAF was also fanned out and bumped leaving the gate, dueled between foes then had nothing left.

on the final turn and faltered. TYBALT settled outside, moved very wide on the final turn with only a mild bid. WHISTLING BIRDS was urged close up three

Footnotes
RUBY BLEU set the pace inside, repulsed a strong challenge near stretch, edged clear mid stretch and won under strong handling. FOREST FIRE was
outside chasing but was unable to match strides but gamely held place. SEMI EXCITED broke slowly, saved ground, drifted out slightly in early stretch and
finished well. FLAT OUT BEAUTIFUL, between rivals early, moved out and challenged entering the stretch but failed to sustain his bid. BROAD STREET
BULLY raced just off the rail and was too late. YES IT'S ROO, three wide in second flight, tired. MOTI was two wide and showed little.

Footnotes
PECAN PATTIE pursued the loose pacesetter between foes, bid in hand on the final turn, rallied clear and remained safe to the finish. GLOBAL AMBITION
angled near the inside after a quarter, rallied outside in the stretch and closed too late. ISABELLA SMILE lagged far behind, advanced wide on the final turn
and gained willingly. SWEET BLAME saved ground in the second flight, angled out in the stretch but flattened. LORDEN'S LOVE quickly drew away,
widened before the half but proved empty in the stretch. MINI SCOOP trailed for three quarters and was never in contention. CAT GIUMARELLO chased
three wide and was finished after half a mile. DAZZLE ME raced four wide down the backstretch and stopped abruptly.
