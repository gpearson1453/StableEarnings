from the rail to the stretch, shifted outside of HOSS CARTWRIGHT, responded when clear but was outfinished for the win. STOCKED also chased the pace
to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch and finished in a mild rally. HOSS CARTWRIGHT set the pace while racing off the rail to the stretch,
responded to urging to mid stretch but was tiring in the late stages. SHARON'S FURY prompted the winner three wide to the stretch then weakened in the
final furlong. IF I HAD A NICKEL had no speed, trailed to the turn, was three then four wide to the stretch and did not rally. BERNARDOS HIDEAWAY was
outsprinted to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive.

TAKES A VILLAGE was outsprinted to the turn, advanced three wide then swung out widest for the drive, rallied once clear and closed steadily to prevail.
EDDIE'S PRINCESS chased the leaders to the turn, came three wide and rallied to get on terms in mid stretch but was outfinished by the winner. SEIZE
THE CHANCE hustled to contest the pace, raced off the rail to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then got outfinished. REAL KEEPER was chasing to the
turn, saved ground to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. PRORIKA had good speed, dueled outside of SEIZE THE CHANCE and
three wide, also responded to mid stretch but was weakening late. RANDOM PLEASURE broke a bit slow, trailed to the turn, was four wide to the stretch
and never a factor.

LOVE AND PEACE (FR) had the best speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then edged away under urging and held driving. ZIARAH (IRE) chased
the winner to the second turn, made a run three wide to the stretch but got outkicked to mid stretch and could not threaten in the drive. POSH HOLLY (IRE)
trailed to the second turn, was two then three wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. WISE RACHEL stalked the pace from the rail,
was two wide on the second turn, was also outrun to mid stretch and weakened. BOUNDFORJAMAICA had no speed, settled for a half mile, got fanned out
to the four path on the far turn and came up empty in the drive. CREATIVE ROMANCE pressed the winner for a half mile, was outrun on the second turn
and tired in the stretch.

ROLINGA was outrun to the turn, saved ground to the quarter pole then swung out widest for the drive and closed with a rush to be along in time. IXTAPA'S
FINEST pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, responded in the drive but could not hold the winner while gamely outnodding BUSY PAYNTER for the
place. BUSY PAYNTER hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then dug in late but was outfinished. PAPAYA
got outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then finished in a rally. LASTING LIGHT tracked the pace early, got fanned four wide on the turn
but was gaining in the late stages. GO SMILEY GO settled mid pack, came three wide to the stretch then shifted in and was also closing ground late. CHIRP
broke out and bumped ACCLAIM THE QUEEN, tracked three wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. ACCLAIM THE QUEEN was bumped
and pinched at the start and trailed throughout.

SATANTA was outsprinted to the turn, shifted off the rail and was two wide then eased out further in the stretch, rallied when set down and closed steadily
to win driving. KINCAID PARK dueled outside of SUNNY RIDE early, edged away while off the rail on the turn, responded in the drive but could not stall the
winner. SURPRISE FASHION had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch and finished in a rally. KNOWN was chasing to the turn then had to circle five
wide to the stretch and could not make an impact late. GRAND SIERRA also chased the pace early, raced two wide on the turn but came up empty in the
drive. SUNNY RIDE dueled while off the rail to the turn then was pushed out to the four path into the stretch and weakened in the lane. DAVE'S GIFT had
no speed, trailed and was never a threat.
