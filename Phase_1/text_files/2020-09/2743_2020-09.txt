Footnotes
SOMUCHSUGAR was well placed early, rallied at the top of the stretch three wide and drew clear under steady urging. SAMMY'S SISTER had good
position throughout, could not reach the winner in the stretch but was second best. SHEZ SHACKED UP set the pace and dueled on the lead from the
inside, weakened late. WINE ME UP BABY never far back, steadied at the three eight pole while between horses and went evenly. SCARLETT'S AWISH
never far back, lacked a late response. RAINBOW SHIP vied for the lead and weakened in mid stretch. FRICKA raced mid pack and was no threat.
IAMGOINGTOSHINE was outrun. J J'S FANCY showed little and trailed.
