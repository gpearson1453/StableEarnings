Footnotes
AFLEET MOON dueled from the outside early, remained engaged with ICY CHARLIE through the turn, shook loose from that one entering the drive and
was well clear while kept to task. ICY CHARLIE dueled from the inside early, battled with the winner through the turn, remained forward but could not match
strides. SIENNA BREEZE well placed from the inside, advanced through the turn, remained forward but could only hold the show. HONEST WOMAN
chased the early pace from the outside, advanced through the turn, responded but was too late. GOLDEN SMILES pressed the early pace outside,
responded but could only improve position. ELLA'S LIL STAR forced the early pace inside but came up empty in the drive. FLASH HANDS forced the early
pace outside but tired in the drive. GEORGIA DAWN had a steady fade. WAR BANDIT was never a factor. FIERY FLASH was no threat. ORETTA had little
interest. LIL PEASTOCH forced the early pace outside and gave way.

JOEMO stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn, responded to
open a clear margin at the eighth pole and was clear late while kept to task. MALLARD'S BRO unhurried early from the outside, inched closer entering the
second turn, responded and gained the place. DONWELL well placed from the outside, advanced through the second turn, responded and gained the show.
CAJUN CASH up close early from the outside, dueled through the second turn but could not keep pace. KING PTOLEMY could only improve position.
CONFEDERATE YELL chased the early pace and tired. TAKE CHARGE CHASE forced the early pace but had nothing for the drive. SECOND GUESS was
no factor. RAISE EM UP was no threat. RED WINED UP dueled from the inside and faded. BILLY BIG (IRE) was never close.
