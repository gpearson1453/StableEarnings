Footnotes
PINOT ENVY steadied early down the backside, awaited room on the turn, slipped through at the quarter pole, drew off in the stretch while being ridden out.
THE GOSPEL OF MARK was never far back, rallied four wide in the stretch and was up for place. BRILLIANTBENNY pressed the pace and dueled on the
lead, needed more late. CLASSIC VOLUME was unhurried early, rallied in mid stretch and had a late gain. FAMILY JET allowed to settle on the inside,
failed to menace. SEASONS END was no threat. ADMIRAL GLEN set the pace and dueled on the lead, weakened in mid stretch. TOM T contended early
and was through after a half.
