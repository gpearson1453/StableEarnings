DANCING WILLARD was toward the back early in a strung out field, advanced on the turn in the three path and had good momentum in late stretch to take
the win. ENTICING SHAQ showed speed to the eighth pole and drifted out while weakening a bit. EL CHEAPO showed to the front, dropped off the pace
and was way back while on the turn, gained and fired late but not in time for more than show. KINETIC ART bumped at the start, was unhurried, got closer
on the rail down the stretch but leveled out late. BUCKEYE KITTEN sat in a good spot in second but evened out and lost position in late stretch. HEIDI'S
SINATRA was in range for a quarter and dropped back while wide in the stretch. LUZON CHARGER was never involved.

three wide to turn, cleared into stretch but proved no match for the winner in the late stages. AMIGO MIKE off slow, back to the stretch racing wide, circled
field for 3rd. SCOTCH chased leaders to the turn, leveled off in the final furlong. MRWILLOUGHBY good break inside, sent hard to turn, ran on in stretch, no
gain. GO UNCLE JOEZ GO broke with field, lost position into turn with no late gain. KAWA never a factor. SONSHINE PEGASUS chased leader to the turn
inside, gave way readily in the stretch. DIAMOND DREAMER never factored.

TEJATE was under some restraint early while sitting off the leader's flank, vied with that one to upper stretch and led clear, staying safe late. CRYPTO'S
TWIN MILL was unhurried from last early, went quickest on the turn, advanced steadily down the stretch and was just up for place at the wire.
CONCORDSDIFFERENCE showed speed to the far turn, vied with the winner down the stretch, yielded to that one in upper stretch and was nailed at the
wire for the place spot, settling for show. LIEBCHEN tracked three wide on the backstretch and made a steady fade from the far turn. MERRIE GOGO
veered out and was climbing at the start, raced rank into the first turn off the rail, got closer near the half mile and faded. MADICHASINGDREAMS was
widest on the backstretch and faded after a quarter.

OLIVE U led to late stretch, was roused and responded to repel foes. STORMY MEMO stalked, rallied on the rail from the turn to the stretch and was willing
but needed more. KYLIES CHARM chased from the rail, took the three path down the stretch and ran on but needed more kick. HER GOLD MINE was
bumped at the start, between horses on the turn, and widest while drifting out in the stretch while managing to improve position. ROBOTRON was last early,
passed a fader on the turn, got closer by mid stretch and evened out. MI CHACHIS INTENTA was bumped at the start, raced mid pack, went four wide on
the turn and was even after that. BOOMERANG BABY chased up close and faded steadlly from the turn.

pace from inside, chased on the turn and held the show spot. HONOR THE D was bothered after the start, raced mid pack, chased closer on the turn and
needed more in the stretch. FLAT OUT BEAUTY faded after a quarter. BUCKEYE WARRIOR was wide on the backstretch while making a steady advance

Footnotes
HEY RAY unhurried to far turn, saved ground into the stretch, grinded away up the rail to prevail with a heady ride. DANCE AN IRISH JIG tracked leader
throughout, cleared in the stretch but was nailed on the wire in a good effort. COUNT YOUR PENNIES sat the perfect position inside to the stretch, floated
out in the drive and settled for the show spot. UNDERSTAND never a real menace. SIGNSOFAWARRIOR threw his rider pre-start and was never in
contention thereafter. TIZ DEJA BLUE had sharp speed to the front, sprinted clear to the quarter pole while used up and stopped.
