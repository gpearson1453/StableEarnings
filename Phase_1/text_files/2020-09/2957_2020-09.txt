GIMBALA stalked the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. EVER SO D'WILD set a
pressured pace and had a slim lead on the turn but was no match for the winner. JACK'S MEMORY was off the pace and roused on the turn but from the
seven path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. SHAMRUCKUS showed no speed and saved ground on the turn but from the six path at the top of
the stretch had no impact. SEA MY MOVES showed speed from the inside and dueled on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had nothing
left.

OMI'S BOY set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path through the stretch prevailed. SEAL TEAM TWO tracked the early leader and
was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch just missed. GRIN N' BEAR broke poorly and moved up on the turn but from the six
path at the top of the stretch needed more. LEO THE RABBIT showed no speed and raced evenly on the turn but was no real threat. DIVINE AMI was well
back, showed little and from the four path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. SEA BUBBA was up close early, chased on the turn, pulled up in deep
stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
TIME TO DANCE was in touch, a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. FAHRENHEIT showed no speed, moved up
on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. TRAPPEZE ARTIST was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the five
path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. SILENCIUM showed speed from the outside and had the lead on the turn but gave way in deep stretch.
THOR'S THUNDER was hustled early and roused on the turn but had no late kick. FLASH MAN was well back and showed little in a dull effort. TRUST IN
SILVER was off the pace and showed nothing while outrun.

Footnotes
CALM IT set a pressured pace, dueled on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. NAKED ILLUSION lacked room on
the first turn and had a slim lead on the far turn but was second best. LEGAL IN CANADA forced the early pace, raced evenly on the far turn and from the
four path at the top of the stretch was up for show. HOPE GARDEN was in touch and roused on the far turn but had no response. STARDUST KITTEN was
off the pace and saved ground on the far turn but had no impact. BEA COURAGEOUS was in range early but trailed the field on the far turn and was never
a threat.
