Footnotes
UNUSUAL MISCHIEF stalked the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide but rallied to engage the leaders into the stretch, edged clear to mid stretch then
held on stubbornly. TEXAS BOB had no speed and trailed to the turn, shifted in and saved ground to the stretch then came off the rail in mid stretch, rallied
steadily between and grabbed the place. SEVENTH WAVE pressed the pace to the turn, was pushed out three deep by UNFLAPPABLE, got outkicked by
the winner to mid stretch but kept on determinedly and lost the place late. ST. GEEZY was outsprinted to the turn, raced four wide to the stretch and finished
willingly. SHINER'S CODE broke a step slow then was outrun to the turn, bid two wide to the stretch then was also gaining ground belatedly. NEAH BAY
tracked the pace three wide to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch then flattened out. INSANIAMANIA had no speed, trailed to the turn, had to circle
five wide to the stretch and could not offer the needed late response. SLEWPY JO settled to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch but came up empty in
the drive. UNFLAPPABLE hustled to the front, set the pace in the two path to the stretch then got outkicked and tired.

Footnotes
BRILLIANT BIRD was quickest and set all the pace two wide to the stretch, responded when set down, did not switch leads in the drive but drew clear
driving. LUCKY ANTARES pressed the winner to the turn, was three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then did not rally but saved the place.
CROWN KITTEN chased the pace to the turn, swung out four wide to the stretch, did not threaten the winner and missed second. COASTAL STARLITE
trailed while void of speed, came two wide to the stretch then lacked a late response. SUGARSEEKER also had no speed, was three wide but never a
threat.

between rivals in upper stretch, rallied to the lead and held driving. SMOKINHOTREDHEAD trailed to the second turn, bid three wide then swung out five
deep into the stretch, was widest in the drive and closed determinedly for the place. PULPIT SINGER hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail to the
stretch, was collared in mid stretch and could not save second. AMERICAN ROYALTY pressed PULPIT SINGER to the second turn, was three wide to the
stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. SWEET CHAYANE stalked the pace to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch but
was outrun to mid stretch and finished evenly. RUN FOR A MILLION had no speed, raced two wide on the far turn but did not rally in the drive. CHARLIE'S

LAWYER PROOF stalked the leaders to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, rallied to the front but was confronted for the lead by FIERA CANELA leaving
mid stretch then outbattled that one to the line. FIERA CANELA bumped with TACKY ANNIE at the start, was outsprinted to the turn, came two wide to the
stretch then rallied between rivals, was almost on terms with the winner leaving mid stretch then got bested late. B B KIDDO had no speed, eased over and
saved ground to the stretch then found a good stride, had to shift out for room leaving mid stretch but closed determinedly late. PROOF OF JAZZ dueled for
the lead from the rail to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch and weakened. TACKY ANNIE was bumped by FIERA CANELA and bumped RAIL HOG at the
start, had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch but failed to threaten in the drive. LADY SKYWALKER attended the pace outside of PROOF OF JAZZ two
wide to the stretch but also weakened in the final furlong. RAIL HOG was bumped at the start, had no speed and was not a factor. MY THREE ASE'S got
outsprinted to the turn then saved ground to no avail. MIZ CAPPADOCIA tracked the leaders outside rivals, was four wide to the stretch but gave out in the
drive.

SHE'S SO PRETTY was well placed to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch and held driving. MISS YOU
MOM settled mid pack for a half mile, was two wide while rallying on the second turn then could not catch the winner best held second. CIMARRON had no
speed, settled to the second turn, swung off the rail to be four wide into the stretch then finished widest of all in a mild rally. FAMILY TRIPS hustled to
contest the pace in the two path for six furlongs, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened. MOON ROCKET was inside of FAMILY TRIPS and dueled
that one from the rail to the stretch then was also outrun to mid stretch and weakened. BILLY'SGOTASINGLE settled mid pack to the half, was three wide to
the stretch but lacked the needed late response. BABY HANG ON had no speed, trailed to the second turn and was never a threat. VONHRA also had no
speed and was always outrun.

HONG KONG COWBOY hustled to the front then set the pace to the second turn, met bids from both AMERICAN CAMP and ALBANY FRONT to the
stretch, pushed away to mid stretch and held determinedly. MATSON was unhurried to the second turn, shifted off the rail and was two wide to the stretch
then eased back in and closed willingly inside to the wire. PRAISE LOUDLY had no speed, settled to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch then
could not impact the top two. ALBANY FRONT pressed the winner to the half, bid two wide between rivals to loom boldly on the second turn but was
outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. BLUES RAPPER had no speed, raced two then three wide on the second turn then came up empty in the drive.
AMERICAN CAMP chased the winner to the half, rallied three wide to engage for the lead on the second turn but got outkicked to mid stretch and tired.
GEM STATE also was chasing the pace, raced two wide to the stretch then gave way.

to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then eased out for room, responded and closed fast late. DR WYSONG had no speed, trailed from the rail to the
stretch then was closing fast but too late. DRIFT AWAY had no speed, raced off the rail on the turn then could not offer the needed late response. LADY
