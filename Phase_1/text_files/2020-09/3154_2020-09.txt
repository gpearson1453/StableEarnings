and remained clear. AQUA SEAFORM SHAME stalked between foes then three wide into the stretch and outfinished BIDDY DUKE for the place honors.
BIDDY DUKE pinballed leaving the gate, forwardly placed off the rail, chased three wide into the drive and got edged for second. MIND OUT settled early
and moved to the inside, swung four wide leaving the turn and showed late effort to gain some ground late. BLUE SKY BABY chased the speed from inside,
saved ground to the stretch and went evenly through the final furlong. PARKOUR bumped both sides in the beginning, steered to the inside, saved ground
around the turn and failed to rally. MOONHALL MILLY (IRE) broke in and bumped rival at the start, raced off the rail then came four wide into the stretch
and proved no menace. POWERFULATTRACTION tracked the pace three wide through the turn and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
SHEZA GIRLY GIRL stalked the pace from inside, slipped through along the fence into the stretch, took over approaching the eighth pole and drew clear
under strong handling. KRISTI'S TIGER raced outside the top pair early, went three wide into the turn, bid alongside the leader nearing the quarter pole,
gained the advantage in upper stretch, overtaken by the winner closing in on the furlong grounds, kept on gamely and proved second best.
GRINNINGEARTOEAR stumbled at the start, raced in range from the outside, took the turn four wide, flattened out in the lane but held the show. HOT ON
THE TRAIL settled early off the fence, angled out at the top of the lane and also flattened in the late stages. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP away quickly and took
control early, set the pace near the inside then a bit off the rail on the turn, headed by rival at the quarter pole and gave way. LOUD LOUD MUSIC attended
the pace just outside the leader, continued close up around the turn, lost ground leaving the bend and faded.

outside the leader, took over nearing the quarter pole, quickly moved clear and powered away under hand urging and ridden out to the wire. VARDA tight
into the first turn then steadied off heels, tracked off the inside then moved four wide on the backstretch, angled in some around the far turn and stayed on to
prove second best. MISS COSTA RICA up close outside the pacesetter, dropped back around the far turn, traveled a bit off the rail into the stretch, kept on
and gained the show. ILLUMINATION broke alertly and assumed control quickly, steered inward and set the pace near the inside, challenged around the far
turn and offered no resistance to the winner losing command nearing the quarter pole, tired in the drive and lost the show. MAKE MISCHIEF in tight entering
the first turn then steadied soon after around that bend, chased off the inside, came three wide into the stretch and had little left.

Footnotes
BABAEL went to the front and set the pace inside, showed the way to the far turn, coaxed at the five-sixteenths when pressure by a pair of rivals, kicked
clear again into the stretch and drew off under urging. HAPI HAPI raced four to five wide into the first turn then angled in some around the bend, remained
off the rail and entered the stretch three wide, angled out in upper stretch and closed late for the place. MOST SANDISFACTORY had early speed outside a
rival then chased the lone leader into the backstretch, continued to track the pacesetter outside a foe, bid three wide around the far turn but could not keep
pace into the lane and got edged for the place. STREET BEHAVIOR tracked four wide to the stretch and never summoned the needed bid. KAZANSKY
chased outside the leader, bid between foes around the far turn, could not match strides into the lane and weakened in the drive. SQUALOTORO stalked
the pace from the inside, saved ground into the lane and never responded when asked. MEADWAY saved ground along the inside and proved no menace.
QUESTION AUTHORITY tracked off the rail then went between runners on the backstretch, traveled two wide on the far turn and faded. FORT DODGE
lagged behind the field early near the inside, moved off the rail in the lane and was always outrun. AMMOLITE hopped at the start to come away last,
traveled off the rail to the lane and tired.

Footnotes
AMANZI YIMPILO (IRE) knocked into rival at the start, pressed the pace from outside, took a short lead mid-stretch and held gamely to the wire. WYFIRE
raced off the rail then entered the turn two wide then moved three wide into the stretch, angled out further in the lane and rallied through the final furlong but
was too late. WINDY CITY RED stalked off the inside, raced outside a rival and two wide into the stretch, finished well and earned the show honors.
COMMANDER KHAI bumped from the outside at the start, stalked near the inside, raced two wide on the turn then moved out three wide in upper stretch,
showed some response in the drive but lacked the needed late punch. NO PEDIGREE set the pace while under pressure, held a short lead to the eighth
pole, lost command soon after, fought back inside and yielded late. THE GREAT ONE saved ground near the fence, moved a bit off the rail in the lane, split
foes and improved position. BASQUE MAN chased the speed from the inside, kept along the rail to the stretch and never responded to urging. FEATHERS
(IRE) unhurried in the early going, traveled off the rail, two wide around the turn then angled out at the top of the lane and failed to threaten. FURY KAP
broke in and bumped foe at the start, stalked outside a rival then three wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MUCHO UNUSUAL had good early speed, took command then cleared and angled to the inside, inched away around the far turn, urged right-handed past
the eighth pole and held gamely. MAXIM RATE stalked the pace off the fence then outside a rival, went two wide into the stretch, chased the winner through
the lane, could find the extra energy to impact the winner but proved second best. LADY PRANCEALOT (IRE) unhurried through the early going, steered
down into the two path, traveled between runners on the first turn then raced a bit off the rail, angled three wide entering the stretch, rallied but was not
enough. TONAHUTU (IRE) off alertly from the inside, drifted out a bit entering the stretch the first time, stalked outside the pacesetter throughout and
weakened in the lane. PRETTY POINT allowed to settle early on and angled to the rail, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out near the eighth pole and was
never a factor. CATCH THE EYE raced three wide off the pace, went three deep around the clubhouse turn, continued outside a rival then three wide into
the stretch and came up empty.

continued three deep around the far turn then exited the bend three wide and kept on through the final furlong. TAKE THE ONE O ONE took control early,
set the pace inside, showed the way to the lane, overtaken by the winner in upper stretch and gave way. SLEEPY EYES TODD chased the speed a bit off

Footnotes
INGEST floated out early on the first turn while pressing the leader, dropped back a bit into a stalking position, re-bid three wide leaving the turn, lugged out
then lugged inward in the stretch, continued to race greenly through the late stages but was able to hold on. BLUE STAR trailed the field early from the
inside, moved out into the two path then three wide on the far turn, swung out at the top of the lane, closed well and was up for second late. WARRENS
CANDY MAN traveled three wide into the first turn, moved out four wide on the backstretch, came out at the top of the lane, rallied and edged rival for the
show. J C EXPRESS stalked the pace from inside, remained along the fence then a bit off the rail into the stretch, finished well but lost the show.
THELUTEISMINE off a bit slow to begin, unhurried in the early stages from off the rail, went two to three wide around the far turn, chased through the drive
then drifted in and steadied off heels in deep stretch. STARS OF BLUEGRASS tracked the pace from inside then moved out into the two path, lacked room
through the lane and finished willingly. TETON VALLEY showed early speed and drifted out a bit on the first turn, set the pace under pressure then moved
clear, relinquished control into the stretch and gave way. INVESTMENT ACCOUNT stalked between foes then a bit off the rail, angled in around the far turn
and weakened. DETECTIVE BERNARDO floated out while outside a pair of rivals early on the first turn, raced off the rail in range of the pacesetter, went
three wide into the stretch and weakened.
