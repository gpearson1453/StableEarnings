Footnotes
NIC AND ZOE was hustled to the lead, saved ground through the turn, and drew off down the lane while kept to the task. SENSE OF SELF broke out and
bumped SHE'S HONORABLE soundly in the opening strides, settled at the rear of the main group, improved three wide on the turn, kept on mildly outside
in the lane and got up for place in time while proving no threat to the winner. SHE'S HONORABLE was soundly bumped by SENSE OF SELF in the opening
strides, chased well off of NIC AND ZOE down the backstretch, inched closer to that foe in the two to three path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch
but could not keep up with NIC AND ZOE, flattened out and lost the place late. MOONLIGHT DANCING raced midpack inside horses, was pushed along
past the five eighths for position, continued under hand urging while saving ground through the turn, came into the lane under a drive and had no rally.
APRIL'S GEM chased two wide down the backstretch, continued midpack between horses on the turn, came up empty in the lane and faded while drifting
out. ZAPPI dwelt at the start, came awkwardly into stride once he did leave the gate, trailed in the three to four path on the turn, floated into the lane in the
five path and made no bid.

VERRAZANOINTHESKY tracked the pace outside of CLARESTOWN early, bid outside of KENNESAW past the three eighths, lost some ground on that foe
into upper stretch, was driven three wide through midstretch, continued unrelentingly and got up in time. KENNESAW was sent to the lead, saved ground
around the turn, was confronted by VERRAZANOINTHESKY past the three eighths, opened up a narrow lead again into upper stretch, came in slightly in
midstretch, kept on under a drive but was caught. CLARESTOWN tracked the leader inside of VERRAZANOINTHESKY early, raced in the pocket around
the turn, shifted toward the rail in upper stretch and bid inside of KENNESAW, was put in tight midstretch when KENNESAW came in, and flattened out in
the final furlong. JAVANICA chased midpack down the back straight and between horses on the turn, was urged between from the quarter pole, raced
greenly in upper stretch, and kept on with interest through the final furlong while not being able to close the gap. SPEND BENJAMINS raced at the inside of
the rear group, continued toward the rear in the two path on the turn, and had no rally inside in the lane. PAYSTER broke outward and hit the gate, raced
three wide in the rear group down the backstretch, was pushed along for a three wide bid on the turn, came three wide into the lane, and came up empty for
the drive. SIMPLE LOGIC lurched awkwardly out of the gate, raced keenly at the rear between horses early, continued at the rear in the four path on the
turn and into the lane, and mustered no bid.

ground quickly on the outside in late stretch for a near miss. FRENCH MINDED led the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, and

Footnotes
TUFF ATTACK chased inside of OVERPRAISE early, edged forward past the nine sixteenths, tracked the leading pair two wide between horses into the far
turn, was urged three wide into the lane, found his best near the furlong pole while still three wide, kicked to the lead and proved best. TAK led into the
clubhouse turn, was confronted by LITTLE SNIP and then DONIVAN MY BOY down the backstretch, surrendered the lead to the latter approaching the half,
tracked in the pocket around the far turn and into the lane, was put in tight in upper stretch, altered out four wide midstretch, rerallied, and got the bob for
place. GOOD INTENT was bumped by BEAST MODE in the opening strides, settled near the rear, continued in the five path at the rear of the main group
around the far turn, was driven six wide into the lane, found his best five wide in the final furlong but lost the bob for place. MIRACLE MOUNTAIN chased
three wide through the clubhouse turn, continued to chase the leading trio outside of CONTRACTION into the backstretch, improved position to stalk outside
of leader DONIVAN MY BOY into the far turn, was pushed along in the three path around that bend, bid into the lane, took the lead from DONIVAN MY BOY
past the three sixteenths, was headed by TUFF ATTACK to his outside with a furlong to go, kept on with interest but was outfinished. OVERPRAISE chased
two wide through the first turn, continued midfield down the backstretch and three wide on the far turn, swung out and was driven five wide into the lane,
rallied with interest but was outkicked in the final furlong. LITTLE SNIP stalked the early pace two wide, continued three wide in range as DONIVAN MY
BOY threaded in between him and TAK approaching the five eighths, did not go with DONIVAN MY BOY as he cleared to the lead approaching the half,
raced three wide into the far turn, lost ground around the bend, floated five wide into the lane and was no further factor. DONIVAN MY BOY raced in range
inside into the first turn, switched two wide and attended the pace between TAK and LITTLE SNIP approaching the five eighths, advanced to take the lead
from TAK approaching the half, set the pace inside of the stalking MIRACLE MOUNTAIN through the far turn, was headed by that foe near the three
sixteenths and weakened. CONTRACTION raced between horses in range through the clubhouse turn, chased the leading trio while well off the rail on the
backstretch, improved four wide on the far turn, came into the stretch still four wide and weakened. BEAST MODE came out and bumped GOOD INTENT in
the opening strides, settled at the rear, continued to trail in the three path on the far turn, was driven into the lane and offered no rally.

Footnotes
NOTABLE EXCEPTION led the field on the rail up the backstretch, relinquished the lead while saving ground around the turn, took over again entering the
stretch, kicked clear and was much the best. DUCKDEVIL tracked the leaders on the inside early, began a bid on the rail near the five sixteenths, angled out
to find room coming off the turn, entered the stretch in the two path and chased the winner home. LAWLESSNESS chased the pace between horses early,
saved ground around the turn and improved position with a bid between horses in late stretch. KAMARA VISION stumbled slightly a few strides out of the
gate, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, began to move up on the rail around the turn, and continued to gain ground on the outside in the
stretch. RUN RABBIT veered in and bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, chased the leader on the outside early, moved up to challenge at
the half mile pole, dueled from the two path around the turn and tired in the stretch. WINE CELLAR bumped with the horse to his outside at the break, trailed
the field on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was not a factor. BALLET SHOW chased the leader between horses in
the opening stages, raced in the two path around the turn and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
LAPIS STORM was headstrong to the lead, continued to set the pace while saving ground through the turn, and held safe under a drive in the lane. FIELD
LETTERS tracked the leader outside of B N A NATIVE GIRL down the backstretch, continued in range between horses around the turn, was driven between
horses into the lane, chased on earnestly to the finish but could not make headway on the leader. B N A NATIVE GIRL tracked the pace inside of FIELD
LETTERS down the backstretch, continued in range in the two path on the turn, turned for home under a drive, kept pace in the tracking flight inside of
FIELD LETTERS to the furlong pole but flattened thereafter. LEMON DROP TWIST chased four wide early, inched forward to track the pace three wide
around the turn, was outpaced by B N A NATIVE GIRL and FIELD LETTERS when asked into the lane, but held for a minor award. LILLET was keen in
second last early, settled back to join inside of LUCKY AT JUSTICE in the rear flight approaching the half, raced in the two path on the turn and lacked the
needed kick in in the lane. STORMY EMPIRE chased inside of LEMON DROP TWIST early, was pushed along on the turn while saving ground behind the
tracking line, came into the lane under a drive, found no rally, and weakened while drifting out. LUCKY AT JUSTICE settled at the rear, continued with the
rear group in the four path around the turn, swung five wide into the stretch under light hand urging, and made no bid.
