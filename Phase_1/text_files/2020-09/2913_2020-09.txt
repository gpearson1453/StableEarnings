Footnotes
BEYOND PRETTY was nudged clear early then taken to rate while setting the pace inside, spurted away after being set down past the five sixteenths, kept
on under stout left handed encouragement and held firm. WHY NOT YOU settled off the pace three wide, came under pressure leaving the far turn, circled
three wide while making progress into the stretch and continued on willingly to bridge the gap. MOUSE CAT tracked the winner two wide, was put to a ride
past the five sixteenths, drifted in near the three sixteenths and faded. MOLLY BOLTS saved ground, edged up to be in range near the half mile marker,
swung four wide while under asking into the lane but came up empty. MAY ON THE RUN , between runners near the five furlong marker, faltered.

Footnotes
AIR TOKEN , off a step slow after drifting in, recovered and moved up off the rail heading to the turn, was patiently handled while taking closer order mid
turn, angled four wide and worked through a seam in upper stretch, closed in under left handed rousing, drew alongside GALATIANS near the sixteenth
marker, forged to a short lead soon after, dueled and held firm. GALATIANS rated forwardly about four wide, moved up to engage the leaders entering the
lane, struck the top past the quarter pole, drifted in when briefly going clear, dug in when confronted approaching the sixteenth pole, dueled and missed in a
game effort. TOE CURLIN' KISS , off the pace while saving ground, was under a ride past the three eighths, cut the corner into the lane, eased out,
advanced between foes near the sixteenth pole and churned on. HOLY SAINT took over soon after the break and set a rated pace, was joined by rivals to
his outside when two wide into the lane, fought on past the quarter pole then weakened in the final furlong. LYNCHBURG stalked three wide, bid between
runners heading towards the lane, pressed then gave way. PARDON THE PUN stalked the pace while saving ground, came out for room nearing the five
sixteenths, swung five wide soon into the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and weakened. WIND RIDGE , four to five wide while well in range,
came under urging mid turn, lacked a response entering the lane, tired and drifted in near mid stretch.

pressure chasing past the three eighths, angled out in the drive and kept on with some effort. ELUSIVE MOTION , under a snug hold stalking three wide, bid
three deep after a half mile, briefly went clear around the turn, was taken on by the winner nearing the five sixteenths, ceded soon after and weakened in the

VIGILANTES WAY , patiently handled four wide while well within range, cruised up and took command in upper stretch, widened after given her cue and
proved much the best while under steady hand encouragement. EPIC IDEA cleared leaving the chute, set the pace two wide, drifted out a bit nearing the
lane, was soon corrected, proved no match through the final three sixteenths but kept on willingly to be second best. MUCHA MEZQUINA hopped slightly at
the break, recovered and rated five wide early on, dropped in towards the rail leaving the far turn, moved up inside rivals mid turn, chased into the lane then
faded. HOLLYWOOD HOOPLA prompted the early pace three wide and faltered before going six furlongs.

SEVEN ON THE ROCKS settled off the pace and outside a rival, moved up mid turn, angled out and came six wide into the lane, rallied under left handed
rousing, came in tightening GLORY SONG when lodging his bid in mid stretch, took over soon after, kicked clear and was geared down some late. EMPIRE
LINE , urged along while saving some ground, eased out advancing past the five sixteenths, was floated out a bit and put in close near the three sixteenths,
shifted out some and finished gamely. GREAT GO GO had speed outside GLORY SONG then cleared heading towards the five eighths pole, set the pace
two wide under a drive into the lane, drifted out and tightened things for GLORY SONG in mid stretch, ceded command a few yards later then gave way
grudgingly in the final sixteenth. GLORY SONG had speed inside then rated back off the leader near the five eighths, angled out and took up chase, was
guided out some into the lane, checked off heels when put in close near mid stretch, recovered and continued on with effort. BAD LITTLE BEAST settled off
the pace while saving ground, moved up a bit while towards the rail in mid stretch then flattened out. GREEK PRINCE , four wide, was not a factor.
OUTSIDE THE BOX , three wide under coaxing mid turn, stayed in range to the quarter pole then gave way. There were objections by the rider's of GLORY
SONG and EMPIRE LINE against the winner alleging interference in the stretch. There was also a stewards' inqiury into the stretch run. Upon review there
was a double disqualification. SEVEN ON THE ROCKS was disqualified from first and placed third and GREAT GO GO was disqualified from third and
placed fourth for causing interference in the stretch.

Footnotes
SMOKIN HOT FACTOR moved up from the outside and engaged AIR ON FIRE nearing the five eighths pole, took over when asked for his best soon into
the lane, spurted clear inside the three sixteenths and eagerly widened under a right handed drive. HILL SHADOW , between rivals early, settled off the
pace, came under a ride and advanced past the three eighths, shifted out for the final furlong and kept on willingly to gain the place. ARMAMENT had speed
to contest the early pace towards the rail, eased back after three furlongs, chased while saving ground into the lane but lacked a solid run. AIR ON FIRE
disputed the early pace outside ARMAMENT then was hooked by the winner heading towards the turn, dueled into the lane and weakened nearing the
sixteenth pole. BELTWAY BOB , wide, was not a factor. MEAD AVENUE broke a step slow, was sent up towards the inside to give early chase, stayed in
touch to the turn then retreated.

JUROR NUMBER FOUR edged up outside rivals nearing the half mile marker and took a stalking spot off the duel, bid three deep mid turn and dueled into
the lane, was roused clear past the three sixteenths, widened a bit in mid stretch, switched to her left lead late and held sway. MISCHIEFS MODEL ,
between foes nearing the half mile marker, raced in the clear then angled four wide to pursue the dueling trio into the lane, moved up past mid stretch,
attempted to lay in and churned on to gain the place. GREEN EYES vied outside BUCKEY'S CHARM early on, gained a short lead leaving the far turn,
sparred between rivals entering the lane then gave way grudgingly through the final seventy yards. WONDERWALL , off the early pace, was under pressure
three to four wide circling into the lane, straightened away and offered a mild response. BUCKEY'S CHARM was sent to the front, dropped in towards the
rail while contesting the pace into the turn, fought on under a hearty ride and inside a pair of runners into the lane then faded. NICOLAR , between rivals
near the half mile marker, was not a factor. WHY NOT TONIGHT drafted back off the pace, dropped in some, raced three wide into the stretch but lacked a
bid. ITALIAN DRESSING , bumped at the break, rated off the pace while saving ground, eased out in the drive but failed to kick on. SHACKABOOM flashed
speed, dropped in towards the rail leaving the five eighths, was steadied briefly nearing the turn and gave way. CHAMPAGNE TOAST bobbled inward at the
break and bumped with ITALIAN DRESSING, raced three deep into the turn but lacked a rally. MIT MAZEL , fractious in the gate, reared when the gates
sprung and lost her rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start. No action was taken.
