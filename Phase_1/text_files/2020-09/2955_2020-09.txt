Footnotes
HEATHER HILLS stumbled at the start, advanced two wide, seized command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied inside of ITSAGIMME'S GIRL through
most of the lane, edged ahead of that foe in deep stretch and just lasted over a late surging runner-up. BARLEY JACK settled off the pace while racing two
wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, closed strongly outside and just missed. ITSAGIMME'S GIRL stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing
the lane, battled outside of the winner through most of the stretch and was outfinished late. HEIDI'S WISH set the early pace along the rail and weakened.
CIAO LUNA chased the pace four wide around the turn and faded in the drive. TIKA saved ground and failed to menace. BALLERINA KITTEN played no
factor while racing three wide.

RATTLESNAKEROSE quickly went clear, set the pace well off the rail, angled into the two path entering the turn, held clear around the bend, continued on
her left lead in the lane, remained clear to deep stretch and lasted between rivals. PREMIUM MOTION was devoid of speed, saved ground, closed inside
and just missed. MEMORIZE tracked the pace four wide and was slowly gaining widest in the final sixteenth. I'LLMAKEYOUSMILE stalked the pace three
wide, bid nearing the lane but flattened out in the lane.

Footnotes
CHESS MASTER came in and bumped NASHVEGAS soon after the start, disputed the pace outside of that rival, drew clear leaving the eighth pole, drifted
out under left-handed urging near the sixteenth pole, quickly straightened out under hand urging and held clear. BOPPIN ANDA WEAVIN settled off the
pace outside early, angled in entering the turn, saved ground around most of the bend, angled four wide nearing the three-sixteenths pole and rallied
through the lane. SARASOTA BOY went evenly while racing two wide. NASHVEGAS was bumped just after the start, set a pressured inside and gave way
in midstretch. TONKA FLOWER steadied entering the turn, saved ground and never threatened. TALENTED SON was outrun while racing two wide.
HOLLYWOOD OVERDOGS played no factor while racing three wide. EXPECT DRAMA was in tight early, dropped well back and trailed throughout.

SPIRITED BEAUTY stalked the pace four wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, dug in inside of JOYFUL JILL in upper stretch, dueled through the
lane and prevailed. JOYFUL JILL settled off the pace outside, made progress four and five wide around the turn, bid outside of the winner in upper stretch,
dueled through the lane but was staved off. LAOBANONAPRAYER was off slowly, advanced two wide around most of the turn, swung six wide near the
quarter pole and rallied outside. GUNS BLAZING chased the pace two wide and lacked a rally. CALI DIVINE was bumped at the start, raced four wide and
failed to menace. DRAGON LILY had early speed three wide and faded around the turn. SILVER STREET was bumped at the start, raced three wide and
never threatened. MY DESDEMONA dueled inside and retreated. ADIOS TRIPPI dueled two wide and tired. BODACIOUS BLEND trailed inside.

Footnotes
GUITAR TRIBUTE settled off the pace two wide, bid three wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, struck the front near the sixteenth
pole and powered clear under a drive. TORRES DEL PAINE pressed the pace two wide, took control near the three-eighths pole, led two wide from there to
the sixteenth pole and was no match for the winner late while staying on well to be clearly second best. COBALT BARON dueled inside for five furlongs,
kept trying inside and lasted for the show. BICKLEY raced in range two wide, was one-paced in the lane and just missed third. JUNIOR BUG saved ground
throughout and finished evenly. TOLAGA BAY lacked speed inside, went three wide around the far turn and improved position. BOLD TREK failed to
menace while racing two and three wide. HANDSOME BOY played no factor while racing two wide. REGAL SPEAKER made little impact while racing four
wide. METHODICAL was outrun while racing two wide.

COMMUNICATION FAIL set the a clear pace in the two path and held safe under a drive. THE KING CHEEK settled off the early pace outside, moved into
a clear second three wide around the turn, finished willingly and was gaining late. BEAVIS chased the winner two and three wide, lacked a rally but plugged
away to last for the show. BRIBERY lagged well back inside, angled four wide near the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. OUR COMMISH failed to menace
while racing three wide. MAID THE JOURNEY played no factor while racing two wide. JAIME JAMEL was in tight at the start, rushed up inside into
contention but came up empty in the lane.
