Footnotes
PURE BODE bobbled at the break brushing the near side stall, led briefly before settling to track the spurting away leader leading the main flight, came
under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, rolled by the leg weary leader to take over near the eighth pole inching away
briefly then dug in and held safe to prevail. GAELIC GOLD just off the inside down the backstretch, tipped three to four wide through the far turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to chase the winner home while securing the place honors.
I'M FINE tracked just off the inside down the backstretch forwardly placed among the main flight in behind a spurting away leader, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. TWICE A LADY two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three
furlongs from home, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and ran on through to the finish. CAINUDOTHETWIST three wide in pursuit, got coaxed
along with seven-sixteenths to go, continued three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. PORTOFINA hustled from the gate, established the
front shortly after the start and spurted away two to three wide down the backstretch, widened into the far turn winging it on the lead, had the field begin to
take closer order with three furlongs to go, took the inside route into upper stretch placed to urging, grew leg weary nearing the eighth pole and was
overhauled just outside that station and tired through to the finish.

Footnotes
MYSTERY BANK away sharply, was rated in the two path prompting the pace, remained on hold drawing up closer to the nemesis during the final stages of
the run around the far turn, settled in at the head of the stretch and was given his cue, inched up to a very tenacious foe, went at it eye to the eye with
ALLEY OOP JOHNNY and gamely got the job done. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY went over to the rail with the advantage after the start, was pulling a bit on the
bit leading the competition on the clubhouse bend, settled down on the backstretch showing the way, accompanied by MYSTERY BANK out in the two path,
saw that rival increase its presence approaching the quarter pole and was set down in response to an impending challenge, desperately held on to the
barest of leads during the ensuing furlong, released it reluctantly as their battle spilled over in the final furlong, then narrowly saved second. KILRONAN sat
reserved in the two path, swung into action by swinging three wide into the stretch, came home with solid late foot, fell short. RAKEEZ unhurried two wide
for over six furlongs, got asked to pick it up tipping into the three path in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, went into the lane, gained steadily en
route for the last major check. SHORE MAGIC made contact with the right side of the gate at the start, recovered and got set up in the pocket, sat within
range of the front runners, stepped into the lane, failed to fire appreciably. COWTOWN two wide during the opening phases, saved ground on the second
bend, angled back to the outside and into path three at the head of the stretch, had no offering. MINI P (IRE) cut over to the rail shortly after the field had
been sent on its way, travelled on the first turn rankly fighting the pilot, went about the backstretch more on the keen than the professional side, ventured
towards path two spinning off the far turn, had no rally.

Footnotes
STAY FOND broke in at the start bumping ZECHA, chased four then three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command nearing the sixteenth
pole, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. COLD HEARTED PEARL dueled four then three wide with COTTON CANDY CUTIE to her inside, took over
sole command nearing the quarter pole and was set down spinning just off the inside for home, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under
threat and was collared outside the sixteenth marker, kept on to preserve the place honors. COTTON CANDY CUTIE dueled inside with the aforementioned
foe to her outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off, dug in under a drive
and weakened in the late stages. BEYOND DISCREET five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, got placed to
coaxing three furlongs from home, went four wide into upper stretch and weakened. ZECHA bumped at the start by STAY FOND who broke inwards,
chased two to three wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened. DIRTY BIRD chased along the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SPA READY got rated along prompting IAINTAFRAIDANOGHOST from path two, took over while under confident handling approaching the quarter pole
marker, responded when called upon more at the three-sixteenths marker to draw well clear, padded the winning margin further in the final furlong, kept to
some encouragement. LIGHTFOOT MISS saved ground until the end of the bend, angled five wide from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all,
rallied for the place. IAINTFRAIDANOGHOST hustled to the top, vied for command from along the rail matched up with the winner, relinquished in the
general area of the quarter pole, contended for another sixteenth before weakening. AUTOSTRADA pursued the pace two to three wide, got switched over
to a brisk ride by midpoint on the turn, fanned four wide into the lane, made no headway. BERNING QUESTION about a half length the tardiest at the break,
was along the inside route tracking the front runners for over a half, shifted into the two path for the stretch run, gave way. HONEY PANTS sighted two to
three wide on the turn, folded. LAOBAN FUREN four wide departing the backstretch, was near the rail and on empty by the head of the stretch.

Footnotes
FORTY ZIP strung out three wide on the clubhouse bend, followed SENGEKONTACKET over closer to the rail after entering the backstretch, got rated
prompting that foe from path two, was forced to undergo the task from between rivals shortly after six furlongs had been run, challenged in earnest as one of
the middle members of a group of four front runners turning onto the head of the stretch, vied with vigour between opponents, managed to attain a slim
advantage inside the eighth pole, faced heavy pressure afterwards, but dug in gamely to stay in the clear. HARLEM HEIGHTS towards the two path during
the initial stages, shifted wider prior to reaching the far turn, got cued up leaving the three-eighths pole, unleashed a bold four run approximately a sixteenth
later, was four to five wide bidding as the outermost of a quartet heading onto the top of the lane, fought onward with good courage down the center of the
course, missed. L'INDISCRET settled into midpack after losing her footing springing from the starting gate, pursued the pace two wide on the first turn, was
a bit wider on the subsequent one, got positioned in between rivals beginning from around the five-sixteenths marker, was still between them getting turned
loose for the drive, was valiant the rest of the way to the finish only to ultimately have to settle for the show. SENGEKONTACKET launched herself to the
front end with a three wide run, cut over to the inside route at the top of the backstretch, got rated showing the way, attended by the winner from the outside,
came under extreme pressure approaching the five-sixteenths pole, forced to fend off three foes by this juncture, got put to a drive entering the stretch, was
determined being hounded to the end but finally gave in the non-stop assault. CEANT remained stationed along the inside route, got kept on hold caught in
traffic prior to spinning into the stretch, slipped to the outside and went on to draft behind the winner in midstretch, kicked into her best in the neighborhood
of the sixteenth marker clawing her way towards the embattled front runners, was forced to steady along when buried in traffic for the final seventy yards.
SAFARI QUEEN three wide on both turns, rallied mildly. LOOK ME OVER chased the pace two wide while under a snug hold for the opening half,
commenced the stretch slightly wider, made no headway. MS BOOMBASTIC lightly bumped in the shadow of the starting gate, tracked the pace at or near
the inside, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, had no rally. MALIBU ANTHEM out awkwardly with her initial stages, got bumped from both
sides at the start, was hung out four wide on the first turn, raced one path nearer the rail on the next one, kept up its pursuit until about the five-sixteenths
pole, came four wide into the stretch and backed away. BARISTA VIXEN made contact with MALIBU ANTHEM at the break, travelled mainly two wide until
the end of the second bend, got sent out into path seven once in the stretch, never made her presence felt.

HIGHLY MOTIVATED veered in at the start forcing HIGHWAY BOUND to steady off his heels and bumping THE REDS into SONO GRATO against
pressure from HIPSKY who recovered outwards from a stumble, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the pace, tucked to the two
path through the turn remaining patiently handled spinning just off the inside into upper stretch behind foes, had HIPSKY drift out straightened away and
was roused to the open seam rallying into it as HIPSKY came back inwards, shouldered that rival to keep the open seam and split foes just inside the eighth
pole taking command, dug in under a drive and inched away in the late stages kept to task. KNOWN AGENDA coaxed from the gate, raced five wide in
pursuit down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, got carried
four wide straightened away as HIPSKY drifted out to his inside, dug in under a drive to challenge a furlong out, dug in willingly to chase the winner home
clear of the rest. TIME LEVERAGE veered in at the start and was corrected to establish the front shortly after, showed the way in hand along the inside,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and was collared just inside the eighth pole, kept
on to preserve the show honors. THE REDS got bumped at the start by HIGHLY MOTIVATED who veered in and in turn bumped SONO GRATO conceding
two to three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three to four wide from near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out
six to seven wide into upper stretch and improved position through to the finish. HIPSKY stumbled at the start recovering outwards and bumping SONO
GRATO, then got brushed by that rival due to pressure coming from outside begun by HIGHLY MOTIVATED, chased just off the inside striding a bit green
and keen, got given some rein to work with and advanced into striking range on the leader into the turn, latched on that rival put to coaxing five-sixteenths
from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drifted out straightened away to the three path carrying KNOWN AGENDA four wide, got corrected
back inwards and was shouldered by HIGHLY MOTIVATED who now held his former path between foes nearing the eighth pole and backed away
weakening in the late stages in an eventful run. COST AVERAGE hustled from the gate, chased four then three wide, was paused briefly in behind the
aforementioned foe just inside the three-eighths as that rival drifted very slightly, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths tipping outwards, angled five
wide into upper stretch and weakened. SONO GRATO got bumped at the start by HIPSKY when that rival recovered outwards from a stumble, then got
bumped by THE REDS due to pressure from HIGHLY MOTIVATED who veered inwards and in turn brushed with HIPSKY, chased along the inside down
the backstretch before tipping three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and
weakened. RUN SMITTY RUN shied in at the start filling the space left vacated by HIGHLY MOTIVATED, chased three to four wide until tucked inside at
the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. HIGHWAY BOUND broke a half a
beat slow and then got steadied off the heels of the inward veering HIGHLY MOTIVATED and conceded three to four lengths to the front before able to
settle into stride, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
FREEWHEELER away without apparent mishap, established the top well before arriving at the conclusion of the backstretch, shifted inward to take up
residence in the two path in the vicinity of the half mile pole, was held in reserve leading the field on the bend, settled in at the top of the stretch before
getting asked for more, gave the desired response and kicked away. VETERANS BEACH off the rail throughout, stalked the winner three wide on the turn,
commenced the stretch run one path farther off the inside, ventured on with willingness but got staved off. STEELERSFANFORLIFE took up the chase two
wide on the turn, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, rallied for the show. THREE OUTLAWS departed the backstretch from the two path,
angled five wide into the stretch, made no late headway. UNCLE GEORGE dove onto the inside route midway on the turn, tracked the pace towards the
back of the pack, got sent out towards path seven during the stretch drive, becoming the widest of all, gained en route for a minor slice. BIG WONDER
forwardly placed saving ground early, became unsettled at the top of the turn as the winner was being maneuvered into the two path, moved outward and
went on to loosely draft behind FREEWHEELER, got set up back on the rail late on the turn, cut the corner into the lane with sufficient room with which to
launch a rally, wasn't up to the task at hand. MORE LIKE IT took the inside route for the opening half, slipped into the two path in upper stretch, flattened
out. LEAP TO GLORY three wide onto the turn, went into the five path exiting it, had no offering. CONSTANT KNIGHT sent over to the rail on the
backstretch, got steered out six wide stepping into the lane, never made its presence felt.

THANKFUL broke in at the start bumping POP A CHOC into MRS. DANVERS and in turn MRS. S, chased three wide in closest aim of the leader, came
under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and took over command near that station, floated five wide into upper stretch before straightening away in a path,
dug in under a drive under threat from a pair and held gamely to the finish to prevail. MRS. DANVERS got pinched in tight between foes at the start due to
pressure from THANKFUL breaking inwards and MRS.S to the inside, chased two to three wide, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and went six
wide into upper stretch attempting to nudge out CRITICAL VALUE for a seam but was denied the move as that rival rightfully kept her lane, dug in loosely
between foes brushing CRITICAL VALUE at the three-sixteenths before altering inside a furlong out several paths to the two path, rallied with good energy
willingly through the final sixteenth but was ultimately staved off. CRITICAL VALUE three to four wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch as the leader floated five wide and got nudged to the seven path by the aforementioned foe attempting to
open a seam loosely between foes, denied the move holding her lane and was brushed and bumped lightly at the three-sixteenths in another attempt,
denied it once more then dug in to run on and chase the top pair home mildly threatening to the finish. POP A CHOC got bumped at the start by
THANKFUL, who broke inwards, and in turn bumped MRS. DANVERS into MRS. S, established the front and cut the pace in hand just off the inside, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths coming under pressure to the outside, yielded the front and swung two to three wide into upper stretch, then tired in the
drive. PASSIVE INVESTING five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four to five wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. MRS. S broke out at the start a step and was brushed by MRS. DANVERS due to pressure
begun by THANKFUL, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired. SOLITARY GEM three to four
paths off the inside in pursuit early on, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, got coaxed along midway on the turn, continued just off the inside into
upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
WICKED AMBER taken hold of after breaking to the inside, was eased to the outside after taking the inside route on the first turn, gradually made her way
into path three travelling on the backstretch, angled five wide for the drive home, straightened away and charged to the front end then doubled that
advantage in the final furlong. LIDO KEY moved over to the rail shortly after the start, contently tracked the pace towards the rear of the field, was forced to
remain on hold stuck in traffic nearing the quarter pole, was still idling behind blockage being maneuvering into path four from upper to midlane, tipped into
the path six with approximately a sixteenth remaining, attaining racing room for the initial time, kicked in to be along for the place. STERLING BEAUTY took
up the chase primarily from the two path until the end of the second bend, angled out five entering the stretch, scurried into contention, flattened out leaving
the sixteenth pole. MARQUET LEGACY underwent a three wide journey until the quarter pole, got moved one path wider in time to spin into the lane under
a drive, issued her best bid from the top of the lane until the general area of the sixteenth pole, weakened. MORE MANGO chase the pace from path two, in
between rivals for the majority of the trip leading up to the quarter pole, commenced the stretch slightly wider while roused, lacked the needed late
response. STORMY DERBY DAY pursued the pace from the two path, got sent out six wide from upper to midstretch, appeared to mostly improve position
by weak and tired ones. POSITIVE SKEW kept watch on the front runners from along the inside, was in some traffic prior to entering the stretch, got steered
out about four wide once in it, had some running room past the eighth pole and gained some real estate. MINIT MAUS saved ground until the quarter pole,
slipped to the outside to scoot past the former pacesetter in upper stretch only to come up empty herself afterwards. WILD NORTH rated prompting the
pace from path two, went about the task from between rivals on turn two, got driven into the lane, gave way. BIG AL'S GAL forwardly placed three wide,
pressed the issue on the far turn, went into the stretch and soon folded. WINIFRED J along the inside disputing the pace, faced off against a pair of foes to
the outside on the second turn, gave in and retreated to last.
