SECRET FORMULA trailed down the backstretch, began to rally in the two path on the turn, split horses in the four path two wide past the furlong marker,
and was along in time under a hand ride. A PERFECT SKY pressed the pace two wide for a half, made the lead, set the balance of the pace then couldn't
handle the late charge of the winner. WILD TILLIE away alertly, set a pressured pace for a half then was outfinished. CRYPTONIC CATWALK vied for the
lead three wide and failed to offer the needed response. STAR OF PRIDE had good early speed then faded. WEEKEND AT LAST was no factor.
LIL'PRINCESSNELLIE was no threat.

FU ROO away alertly, set all the pace while nicely rated and maintained his advantage under brisk handling. OHIO EAGLE stalked the pace three then two
wide and got up for second in the five path. MASTER LEGIONAIRE close up while hung out in the five path, lugged in through the stretch but was steadily
gaining ground then clipped heels past the wire. TAPAWAY chased the winner from the inside for six furlongs, shifted out to the four path and finished
determinedly. ESTRELLA DE DANE moved up between horses entering the far turn then leveled off. TANCAHUA allowed to settle, inched closer along the
inside into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. DOUGS MORNING PICK chased the early pace and was through after a half. FLINT CORN was in tight
at the start and trailed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
MY BETS always within striking distance while inside, shifted out four wide nearing the quarter pole, rallied to make the lead a furlong out then finished full
of run under a strong hand ride to win as much the best. LA CAFETERA pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead, set the pace into the
stretch then was no match for the winner. MOR BREEZE away alertly, set the pace along the inside for nearly six furlongs, angled out to the five path near
mid stretch and was outfinished . KENDALIN allowed to settle, loomed boldly three wide midway on the second turn then failed to sustain that bid.
WROTE'S GIFT was no threat. LET'S GO LUNA was a froward factor in the four path for six furlongs then wilted. WARRIOR BABY was through after a half.
EVEN IF trailed.
