Footnotes
FLOWERS FOR LISA established the top in short order, gradually made his way towards the inside route, getting there by the conclusion of the backstretch,
shook free of the main contenders, even with some of them under a drive as early as the seven-sixteenths marker, slithered into path two entering the
stretch, kicked clear, wandering between paths two and three somewhat erratically while doing so. CONTROL GROUP hustled along on the chute, took up
the chase from path three, got set down in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, proved no match. THEBIGFUNDAMENTAL guided over to the rail,
underwent a ground-saving journey, was put to a drive at the five-sixteenths pole, went into the lane and got outfinished. HEAVY ROLLER pressed the
issue from path, fell back even though put to a drive on the turn, swung four wide into the lane and fell back even farther. DIRECT ORDER pursued the
pace two wide, never got involved. SHALAKO at or near the inside, was never in it.

Footnotes
ADVANCED STRATEGY two then three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied
to issue a challenge through the final eighth taking command just outside the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the finish to prevail. JADE'S DREAM
established the front and showed the way rated along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive inching away to the eighth pole, got collared near the sixteenth pole and ran on to preserve the place honors. THE GOLDEN DOOR three wide in
pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under a ride at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. A VOW
OF BEAUTY bumped at the start by KAZ'S BEACH who broke outwards, chased inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn
placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and improved position to the finish. TERCERO broke a half a beat slow and lost his lane to
a rival, chased inside down the backstretch from the tail of the field, tipped to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from
home, swung three to four wide at the head of the stretch and passed tired rivals. SILVER TOKEN drifted out after the start floating out a rival slightly,
tracked the pace just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. KAZ'S BEACH broke out at the start bumping A VOW OF BEAUTY, tracked the pace inside growing keen under restraint when
off the heels of a rival near the seven-eighths marker skygazing for a few strides before settling once established down the backstretch, saved ground
through the far turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no headway. ECCOCI QUA three
to four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. KEY TO
VICTORY just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the
inside into upper stretch and offered no response.

Footnotes
AMERICAN WEST off the rail throughout, proceeded along the backstretch until a hand ride that began nearly from the get-go, was put to more vigorous
encouragement stepping three wide onto the turn, got set down at the five-sixteenths marker after having fallen back a tad, was still in path three spinnintg
into the lane, closed in on the ones to catch readily, out-fought a pair of rivals to her right in deep to prove best. MILLEFEUILLE away without apparent
mishap, sneaked her way into the pocket approaching the half mile pole, kept watch on the front runners towards midpack, got cued up for the drive,
scurried into contention with a menacing run from upper to midlane, fougtht on willingly in the last eighth en route for second. LEIA MARIE was rated along
prompting the pace from path two, drew up and into closer contact with JOUSTER as the third fraction was being finalized, settled in upper stretch and
challenged in earnest, took charge only to have the top twosome bearing down hard from path three and the inside route respectively, got overhauled in
deep stretch. JAMSSTAR took up the chase from the two path on the turn, under a ride by the pilot, commenced the stretch one path farther off the inside,
made no headway. JOUSTER kept the advantage after out-breaking the competition, rated well showing the way from along the rail, accompanied by LEIA
MARIE to her outside, succumbed when put to the test by that opponent in upper stretch, then steadily backed away. SHESHAPPY sent over to the inside
route after bumping with SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN in the shadow of the starting gate, got flipped into path two after MILLEFEUILLE moved over to the rail
herself near the end of the backstretch, angled four wide into the stretch, lacked the necessary response. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN came inward after
taking an awkward initial step, bumped into SHESHAPPY right afterwards, underwent a two wide pursuit, came into the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
TRAIPSING away well, ranged up to establish the front when most rivals got placed to reserve and dragged off the front, showed the way in hand along the
inside through sensible splits, remained patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth
pole, dug in and held well to prevail. SIMPLICITY (FR) bumped at the start by ESPRESSO SHOT, who broke outwards, tracked the front two then three
wide from mid pack, got let out spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors in a blanket finish. TUNED
(GB) tossed her head lightly at the break and was wrangled at the start to the tail of the field, settled just off the inside unhurried, remained on hold until
roused spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, closed well to procure the show honors. STONE TORNADO (GB) tracked the pace along the inside,
got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch in behind the eventual winner, offered up a mild bid. NIKO'S DREAM just off the inside in pursuit from
mid pack, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, closed well but was outfinished. PALLAS ATHENE got steadied
at the start when TRAIPSING crossed in front, settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, tipped four wide through the far turn and came under
coaxing near the quarter pole, went six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ESPRESSO SHOT broke out at the start bumping SIMPLICITY, came
under coaxing to be forwardly placed then got placed to restraint to concede the lead to TRAIPSING and grew briefly rank tossing her head into the
backstretch, raced well rated just off the inside in closest aim of the leader latching on briefly to the outside six and a half furlongs from home and being
taken back a bit, remained patiently handled advancing once more to latch on five-sixteenths from home, got asked spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BREADMAN broke in line with fellow tardy-starter OPUS CURIS, powered up to midpack almost immediately afterwards, without need of any
encouragement from the pilot, sat reserved until the conclusion of the backstretch, departed it from the three path, flashed interest when let out a notch
springing from the half mile pole, angled four wide into the lane, straightened away and was given his cue, charged up to the leader during the ensuing
furlong, out-dueled that foe to take over with approximately a sixteenth to go and edged away. MASKED MARAUDER established the top in short order,
moved over to the inside, was rated along carving out the fractions, with I'M BLAMING YOU in accompaniment out in the two path, got turned loose coming
up to the three-sixteenths pole, was soon pounced upon by the eventual winner, relinquished in the vicinity of the sixteenth marker, had no difficulty
salvaging second. ARROWHEART tracked the front runners from the pocket, was put to a drive as three-quarters was being completed, tipped towards path
two early during the stretch run, got outkicked. MAMBONICK stung out four wide on the chute, was one path nearer the rail on the fuller turn, fanned out into
path seven from upper to midstretch, maintaining its status of just about being the widest of all throughout, mustered up a response sufficient enough to
claim the final significant slice of the purse. WICKED EASY at or near the inside in pursuit of the pace, proceeded along the backstretch well held, went into
the lane and after being asked for more, made no headway. I'M BLAMING YOU prompted the pace from the two path, got roused at the five-sixteenths
marker after dropping a bit, commenced the stretch run slightly wider, gave way. PIVOTAL RUN three wide for the opening three-quarters, shifted into path
six once in the stretch, made no impact. CHULAINN took up the chasr towards the two path, got called upon nearing the quarter pole, went five wide into the
lane, had no offering. HURTGEN FOREST four wide on the chute, travelled in the three path on the turn, came four wide into the lane, backed away. OPUS
CURLS saved ground to no avail while trailing throughout.

CANDY FLOWER established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into
upper stretch, drew away under a drive and held well to the finish. VALLETTA broke a half a beat slow and lost her lane to GIGGLE FACTORY who
recovered outwards from a stumble, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. HARD WON tracked the pace along the inside from near the rear, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. WICKED HAPPY stumbled at the start, recovered to track just off the inside

Footnotes
BIG ENGINE gathered in after breaking to the outside with its initial step, got set up in the pocket well before arriving at the conclusion of the backstretch,
sat poised to strike at any time given the opportunity during the run around the bend, remained on hold forced to draft behind TRIBECCA during the early
stages of the stretch run, managed to slip into the two path and into freedom deep into the furlong grounds, was given its cue and took off in earnest after
the previously-mentioned foe, out-dueled that one and edged clear. TRIBECCA cut over to the rail with the advantage coming up to the half mile pole,
showed the way well rated while facing only mild pressure for nearly a half, came up to the three-sixteenths marker and saw the pilot go to work,
relinquished with some reluctance, dug in long enough to save second. T LOVES A FIGHT slow to settle into stride, underwent a four wide pursuit on the
turn, was about as wide spinning into the lane, got asked for his best in the general area of the three-sixteenths marker, steadily gained real estate, fell short
of snagging away the place award. PETE'S PLAY CALL chased the pace three wide, got driven into the lane, flattened out in the final furlong. LAST
JUDGMENT rode the rail on the backstretch, got maneuvered into path two at the half mile pole, idled along behind some of the front runners beginning
from late on the bend, inched its way to the outside, yet idling along, tipped out belatedly into path five for clearance in the general area of the sixteenth
pole, went onward securing a minor slice, having never really gotten involved. CELTIC CHAOS quickly spotted on the rail, angled five wide into the stretch,
made no impact. MOUNT TRAVERS pressed the pact two wide and gave way. LIAM'S PRIDE three wide at the top of the turn, was along the inside route
by the five-sixteenths pole, cut the corner with little left and retreated.

Footnotes
VIADERA (GB) tracked the pace along the inside from near the rear, tipped to the two path into the far turn remaining patiently handled until set down
spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive rallying to angle in a path inside the eighth pole, rallied up the rail and surged late inside to get up
and prevail in the final jumps to the finish. BLOWOUT (GB) established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand three to four paths off
the rail down the backstretch through swift splits, tucked to the two path into the far turn, remained patiently handled awaiting a challenge and got it spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive gamely fending off flanking challenges through to the final strides when nailed inside by her barn
mate. SWEET BYE AND BYE coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong latched on the aforementioned foe
fighting on through to the finish but could not go by and was along for the show honors in a good effort. NOOR SAHARA (IRE) bumped at the start by
LEMON ZIP who broke outwards, chased two to three wide from near the rear, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch and finished with good
energy to secure the last major share clear of the rest. CHALEUR (GB) three wide in pursuit just off the pace, got coaxed along five-sixteenths from home,
swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. ATOMIC BLONDE coaxed from the start, chased three wide down the backstretch,
tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, got set down spinning just off the inside for home and weakened in the late going. FEEL GLORIOUS (GB) saved
ground at the tail of the field, tipped three wide into the far turn and advanced outside coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, went five wide into
upper stretch and offered no further kick. GETMOTHERAROSE broke on top and settled three wide in pursuit from mid pack, tucked to the two path through
the far turn and got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered no response. LEMON ZIP broke out at the
start bumping NOOR SAHARA, chased along the inside from mid pack, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired.

FIRENZE FIRE assumed a forward position after the field had been sent off and running, stalked SHARE THE RIDE from path in between rivals during the
run around the bend, was let out a notch a few jumps shy of the quarter pole, wandered towards path three challenging in earnest in the vicinity of the
three-sixteenths pole, wasted little time taking charge, extended the margin in the final furlong under good handling. FUNNY GUY contently brought up the
back of the pack during the initial stages, glided into the four path from the top of the turn to its midway point, was in the four path spinning into the stretch,
proved no match today rallying for the place. SHARE THE RIDE hustled from the gate to establish the top, got guided over to the rail, showed the way being
rated along, felt an uptick in pressure as the half was being completed, went up to the three-sixteenths pole before getting called upon for more, got
overpowered by FIRENZE FIRE, stayed on to earn the show award. TRUE TIMBER saved ground until the quarter pole, failed to fire appreciably after
getting placed two wide at the head of the stretch. ENGAGE took up the chase three wide on the turn, swung into the lane, couldn't keep pace with the
winner then gave way in the last eighth.

Footnotes
ALBIE broke out at the start bumping SHOOTIN THE BREEZE in tandem with RIVER KNIGHT who broke in a step, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, tipped out for a clear seam nearing the eighth pole two paths and
rallied to split foes near the sixteenth marker before seizing command inside that station among a host of rivals and inched away to the finish to be up on the
wire. BEACHSIDE coaxed from the gate, crossed to settle three wide in pursuit from mid pack, tucked to the two path through the far turn and came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong splitting rivals a
sixteenth from home and was up for the place honors in a blanket finish. BARLEEWON got bumped at the start when MR. VINCENT stumbled awkwardly
and recovered outwards to his inside, chased three then two wide from mid pack, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick to close in and be among a host of rivals hitting the finish together and just got the head bob on the wire for the show
honors. HYPNOTIST dueled early on from the three path with RIVER KNIGHT to his inside, backed off a bit midway down the backstretch tracking in
closest aim, tucked to the two path into the far turn and steadily advanced outside to duel once more with that rival three furlongs from home, knocked
heads coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in and took over command just outside the eighth pole, came
under threat from a host of rivals, got collared just inside the sixteenth marker, then got outfinished in the final jumps. MR. VINCENT stumbled awkwardly at
the start genuflecting outwards and bumping with BARLEEWON, chased four to five paths off the inside near the rear of the field down the backstretch,
tucked two to three wide through the turn and came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid showing
good courage after a tough start to latch on a trio and of the top quartet at the wire. JOY CITY three wide in pursuit forwardly placed early on, lost some
position, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to bid a furlong from home getting on
near even terms for command at that station, dug in and flattened out in the very late stages. SHOOTIN THE BREEZE got bumped between foes who each
broke his way, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and failed to
quicken staying on one paced to the finish. DIANNESIMPAZIBLE broke out a step at the start, chased three then two wide from near the rear, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. ALLIED INVASION broke in at the start and was
corrected, saved ground at the tail of the field down the backstretch, tipped out three to four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing just outside the
five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. MY AMANJENA coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside from
just off the pace, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, went three wide for home and weakened. FOTIS coaxed from the gate, tracked just off
inside from just off the pace, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to go, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. RIVER KNIGHT
broke in at the start bumping SHOOTIN THE BREEZE in concert with ALBIE who broke outwards, dueled inside with HYPNOTIST to his outside in the early
stages before that rival backed off, showed the way safely in front and in hand, had that same rival advance once more near the three-eighths pole and
knocked heads a second time through the latter turn, got roused cutting the corner sharply into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared nearing
the eighth pole, then weakened through to the finish.
