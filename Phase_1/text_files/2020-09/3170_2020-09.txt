ENVOUTANTE was allowed to settle early, moved up three wide at the eighth pole and finished well to be clear under strong encouragement. PAIGE ANNE
tracked the leader while racing two wide, led around the far turn but was no match for the winner late to finish second best. SEATTLE SLANG was unhurried
early, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough late. TRIXIE RACER stalked the pace, raced four wide nearing the quarter pole and
had no final winning bid. JEWELED PRINCESS was allowed to settle off the pace and failed to have a response. CURLS AND BOWS dropped back early,
raced five wide at the eighth pole and had no response. DARLENE STRONG failed to sustain a bid. HOTASAPISTOL set all the pace and tired readily.

Footnotes
SUNLIT SONG positioned just off the top two leaders and rated under slight restraint, picked up the pace on the far turn, hustled up between foes in the final
furlong, lost whip near the sixteenth pole and got by late under a strong hand ride. TUT'S REVENGE set a pressured pace down the backstretch, continued
to turn back bids with a furlong left to run, continued to dig in gamely but could not hold off the winner. MR. MISUNDERSTOOD was allowed to settle in
early stages, lodged a four wide bid on the far turn, roused forward into contention then lacked the needed kick to reach the top pair. YOUVESAIDITALL
raced off the pace through early stages, was put to a drive on the far turn, moved into closer contention then needed more late for serious impact.
REDATORY was forwardly placed and pressed the pacesetter, made a run for the lead on the far turn but could not sustain bid near the furlong marker.
PROSPECTOR FEVER raced off the pace then swung into stretch drive five to six wide and failed to muster a rally. LEADER OF MEN was unhurried
through early stages and failed to gain when placed under pressure. SHERIFF BROWN raced in range down the backstretch then faded in the far turn.

Footnotes
CALIENTE CANDY was well placed being nicely rated off the early leaders, began to pick up the pace along the outside while confidently handled,
responded willingly when called upon at the head of the lane and pulled away. IRISH MISCHIEF settled off the early leaders, hustled up three wide nearing
the quarter pole, shifted out wider upper stretch and continued a solid bid to finish on equal terms for place. BRAVE DAISEY battled for the lead around the
turn, got over taken by the winner upper stretch and stayed on to finish on equal terms for place. MT. BRAVE chased up close through the opening quarter,
vied three wide for the lead at the quarter pole then gave way in the lane. KARATE HOTTIE showed speed and battled for the lead around the turn then
tired in the stretch. COSMIC CODE raced off the pace, swung five wide into stretch run and lacked a needed rally. WISHFUL QUALITY raced off the pace
and failed to move int0o contention. FINAL FORM vied the lead, fought back around the turn then had nothing left. SWEET MARY M bobbled at the start
and showed early interest then lacked response on the turn.

Footnotes
KANDY GINGER was off to a good start then settled in just off the leader, moved up to match strides with MISS TWENTY then edged away while still
unasked in the turn, continued to move away while ridden out with much more left in the tank. MISS TWENTY held a slim advantage in opening stages then
vied for the lead with KANDY GINGER entering the turn, could not maintain equal terms with eventual winner at the three eighths pole but continued a
steady effort for second best. GOTTA SEE RED sat back off the early speed, hustled up mid-2way around the turn, swung five to six wide into stretch run
and stayed on for a share. NOVEL SQUALL positioned just off the top two leaders in early stages, dropped to the inside and put to a drive leaving the turn
then gave way in the lane. COSMETOLOGY raced in the back then gained position on the turn but failed to gain a threatening position. LITTLE SAMURAI
raced near the inside leaving the turn and failed to move in the stretch. HOPPING JITTERBUG showed response in the opening quarter then faded.
FRIENDLY MISCHIEF chased the early pace then dropped back and eased up to the wire.

SHARED SENSE raced tow to three wide into the first turn and settled under slight restraint to rate near midpack, given cue near the five-sixteenths pole,
responded and advanced four wide into upper stretch to duel for the lead, continued to battle with MO MOSA in the final furlong, dug in gamely, turned away
rival and finished clear. MO MOSA positioned off the top pair and stalked rivals down the backstretch, hustled up along the outside on the far turn, dueled
for the lead into upper stretch, continued in a heated battle with SHARED SENSE past the furlong marker but could not resist winner in final stages. LIAM
held a slim advantage down the backstretch, vied for the lead on the far turn, continued to put in a good effort into stretch run then could not keep pace in
the final sixteenth. AVANT GARDE was allowed to settle in early stages, launched a five wide bid on the far turn, swung wide into stretch run, showed
interest then shifted wider and evened out in final stages. SALOW raced off the pace, hustled up on the far turn then lacked the needed response to make
an impact in the stretch run. ROWDY YATES rated down the backstretch then failed to move on when called upon near the three-eighths pole. DEAN
MARTINI was forwardly placed just off the leader down the backstretch then steadily faded. CODE RUNNER raced in or near the back and lacked a rally.
CREATIVE PLAN showed early response then dropped back after six furlongs.

Footnotes
CONFESSING was allowed to settle off the pace while saving ground down the backstretch, continued patiently handled two wide on the far turn, given cue
upper stretch, responded, angled out a path wider, dug in gamely and edged away. QUICK QUICK QUICK saved ground and led the way around the first
turn, raced on top under pressure down the backstretch, took a clearer ;lead on the far turn, opened up upper stretch, continued to put in a good effort but
could not resist the winner in final stages. CORLUNA raced off the pace down the backstretch, launched a rail bid leaving the final turn, moved up into close
contention and continued a steady effort for a share. SOARING NOW settled while rated through early stages, hustled up along the outside near the quarter
pole, swung five to six wide into the stretch and had a mild improve. ZAMZAM raced in the back then swung wide into the stretch and passed tiring foes.
STREAK OF LUCK applied pace pressure to the leader down the backstretch, continued in range around the far turn then faded in the lane. BLESSED
AGAIN was rated through early stages,. saved ground while hustled up along the inside on the final turn and lacked response in the stretch run.
DECORATED ACE raced near midpack two to three wide then steadily faded. LOVE ON TIDES raced in range then edged up four deep near the three
eighths pole but could not sustain bid and dropped back. CURLIN'S JOURNEY stalked up close down the backstretch then failed to keep pace on the far
turn.
