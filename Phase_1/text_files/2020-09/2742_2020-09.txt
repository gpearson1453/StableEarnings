the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then could not threaten the winner and held the place safe.
BEYOND SMART stalked the pace on the outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out.
MASTEROFTHEHOUSE ran evenly. GOLD WING was no factor. BUZZ OFF mid pack, gained position three and four wide through the second, then had

Footnotes
RED LINGERIE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased through the turn, then drew off in the lane and held under steady pressure. FUSI
allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and closed the gap on the winner late.
PEMAQUID DOT well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. SEA
CANDY allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and got up for a share. DOMINANT STRANGER mid
pack, moved up while angling out through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and evened out. ACADIA FLEET tracked the pace, saved ground through the
turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. LOVELY ARABELLA never far back, held position three wide through the
turn, then had no rally. DREAM OF HERO was never involved.
