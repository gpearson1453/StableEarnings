spot. BOOMERANG MISS set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and then yielded. HEADING

wide on the far turn and rallied mildly. BIG PERM pulled in the early stages, then tracked inside, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled into the lane and
weakened. MASTERIO raced off the pace three wide, then between rivals, steadied at the seven sixteenths marker and lacked a rally. FEISTY KITTEN
