came under pressure toward the three eighths and drew clear midway on the far turn, dug in to steady encouragement leaving the turn but was caught the
final strides. TAPPIN FOR GLORY stalked the pace from the two and three paths, challenged toward the three eighths pole but dropped back midway on
the far turn, though, came back in the lane to finish evenly. JUST GETS BETTER broke outward and settled just off the pace three wide into the
backstretch, faded past the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path and improved his position. STRIDE ON BY saved ground well off
the pace the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and passed rivals in the lane. PISTOL P came in at the
break then stalked off the rail, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and weakened. MINISTRY OF MAGIC

Footnotes
CAPE LOOKOUT stalked the earlier pace off the rail then coasted to the front approaching the seven sixteenths pole, was soon clear then came under
pressure midway on the far turn and held well under steady stretch handling. DEDICATED saved ground the first turn then eased outward into the
backstretch, started a bid from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and could only close the gap down the lane. JACKY'S MAN
settled back toward the inside the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and angled to the seven path on the far turn and was along for third later
yards. MEILLEUR settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the four path,
angled to the six path leaving the turn but flattened stride from mid-stretch. AWESOME FU was unprepared and lunged from the gate then stalked the pace
four wide from the mid point of the opening turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened. SILVER CASTLE
raced off the pace inside then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, though, weakened at the rail on the far turn. PEP TALKING raced well off the
pace in the three path the first turn, entered the backstretch outside and showed little response. CHERUBIM raced off the pace in the three path the first
turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then weakened. SAVAGERY angled to the inside to rate the early
pace, was caught approaching the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point but faded readily nearing the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
BRIDGING THE GAP rated a short lead inside through the opening five eighths then came under pressure into the far turn, was met at even terms midway
on the turn, edged clear past the eighth pole then kept alert in the stretch. SEE YA MANANA raced off the pace in the two and three paths then bid
approaching the five sixteenths pole, drew to even terms midway on the far turn but dropped back past the eighth pole and had to settle for second best. B'S
WILD CORK settled back inside the opening turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and finished evenly. CAMERON
STREET raced well off the pace in the two and three paths and raced outside with a bid into the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the three path and
could only improve her position. GRACE ELIZABETH stalked the earlier pace two deep then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, though, faded
on the far turn. GANDARI saved ground off the pace and showed little response the last three eighths.

SECRET CASTLE settled close in the three path the first turn then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, dueled to the
lead passing the eighth pole, raced clear mid-stretch and lasted well. HOW IS SHE raced off the pace in the four path the first turn and entered the
backstretch outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the seven path, dug in to take second later yards and was gaining
on the winner. C V'S CAMPFIRE saved ground through the opening turn then bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail,
eased outward into the lane and dueled through the stretch for third. SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS stumbled to her knees leaving the gate and settled off the
pace in the three and four paths and raced well back leaving the first turn, then bid nearing the three eighths pole, stayed in range of the lead in the six path
of the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. WINDSOR'S CHAMPION entered the opening turn in the four path then settled with the pace
three wide past the half mile pole, challenged leaving the three eighths and took the nod toward the head of the lane, but was caught past the eighth pole
and flattened out inside the sixteenth. KATALIMA raced with the pace two deep then challenged while between horses leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
but dropped back toward the quarter and faded on the far turn. CASTLE OF CAYLEE raced with the pace inside and dug in leaving the three eighths pole,
yielded the advantage toward the head of the lane then weakened the final furlong. GATTOLOTTACHARM stalked the pace inside the opening turn then
gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded approaching the five sixteenth.

Footnotes
RUNNIN'TOLUVYA settled off the pace in the three path the first turn then started his bid past the seven sixteenths pole and challenged leaving the three
eighths, was carried out by the pace-setter on the far turn, but dug in leaving the eighth pole to take the lead mid-stretch and inched clear under the wire.
NORTH ATLANTIC raced off the pace in the two and three paths then bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the far turn at the rail and had a slim brief
lead mid-stretch, but was outfinished the final sixteenth. PENGUIN POWER rated a slim lead inside and dug in to the challenge of Runnin'toluvya from the
three eighths pole, maintained the edge while drifting outward on the far turn but was caught mid-stretch and flattened inside the sixteenth pole. RUSH TO
THE CASTLE saved ground off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch. HERO'S MAN accelerated to contention and raced close two
deep, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, but faded at the rail rounding the far turn.

was caught flattening stride mid-stretch. FREEDOM IS RINGING gave chase and rounded the turn about the four path then flattened stride later yards.
MAJESTIC SEAS broke outward to make contact with Unnamed Soldier and steadied sharply then gave chase well off the pace, came through the turn
about the five path, angled out in the upper stretch and finished evenly outside. BENNY CHANG chased the pace through the backstretch and rounded the
turn about the six path then flattened stride the final furlong. DASHIELL was bumped at the break and picked up the chase through the backstretch, raced
