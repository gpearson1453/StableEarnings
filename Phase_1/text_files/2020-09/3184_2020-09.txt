Footnotes
ONE STOP SHOP settled well, advanced on the far turn, was swung four wide, lodged a bid and was all out to fend off CANDY MY BOY. The latter forced
the pace, led around the far turn, was headed and stuck to his task gamely. PROMISING SHOES outpaced early, moved closer on the far turn and kept on
in the stretch. HOLIDAY MAN set a contested pace, was headed on the far turn and yielded. BAGPIPES raced forwardly while four wide and faded.
ONOMATOPOEIA chased while five wide and faltered. KIT CHECK was always outrun. PER RULING #46165 FROM THE IOWA RACING COMMISSION,
CANDY MY BOY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
