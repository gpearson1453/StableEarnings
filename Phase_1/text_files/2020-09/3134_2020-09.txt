showed good early speed along the inside, had a clear lead nearing the sixteenth pole and just missed in a game effort. YANKEE INDIAN stalked the early
pace, raced four wide at the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. BOLD IMAGE was off a step slow, raced towards the inside throughout and never

Footnotes
IM JUSTA BACHELOR pressed the early pace, raced two wide and finished well to draw clear late under strong handling. DREADNAUGHT vied for the
early along the inside and was no match late for the winner to finish second best. WELCOME WEST stalked the early pace, raced four wide at the quarter
pole and had no final winning bid. MUNI MUNI SLEW stalked the pace from the outside, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally.
MANDOLIN JIM dropped back early, raced six wide through the lane and had not enough. REVIVAL settled early, raced along the inside through the far turn
and never threatened. MY GOLDEN M settled to the second flight early on, raced in the three path through the stretch and never was a factor. UNBRIDLED
TEXAS failed to respond. SUMMER WAGES pressed the early pace and gave way. OBSTRUCTED VIEW was off slowly and never menaced.
BEGGARTHYSTAR failed to threaten.
