Footnotes
JUST RIGHT pressed the leader from the outside in the four path between foes, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths and remained patiently
handled applying pressure to the leader in concert with DURKIN'S CALL to his outside, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, came under light
coaxing at the three-sixteenths, took over command at the eighth pole and edged away under a light hand drive, then was in hand to prevail comfortably on
the wire. ZONIC chased two to three wide from the tail of the field coming under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch
and kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors in the last jumps. PLAYWRIGHT chased along the inside down the backstretch and then three wide
through the turn placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to just get up for the show honors
at the finish. HIT IT ONCE MORE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand from the three path under pressure from a trio, tucked inside at the
nine-sixteenths as the innermost prompter dropped back, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, still pressed by a pair, spun just off the inside for
home, dug in under a drive and relinquished the lead near the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages getting nailed on the wire for the place and
show honors. DURKIN'S CALL coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace from the five path outside a trio, tucked three wide through the turn now outside
the top pair, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, got shaken off straightened away and weakened. MANIFEST DESTINY
hustled from the gate, showed brief speed from the two path applying pressure to the leader from the inside, got shaken off into the turn and came under
coaxing now giving chase along the inside at the seven-sixteenths, faded through the turn, went two to three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MONIFICENT established the top in short order, set up residence in the two path, showed the way, feeling the presence of MOON SWEEPER out in path
three by the top of the bend, saw that opponent looming dangerously as the half was being rattled off, got called upon turning into the stretch, went over to
the rail right afterwards, staved off that foe only to face a fresher challenger in the form of SNICKET by the eighth pole, had the nemesis chop away bit by bit
during the duel that followed, but had enough at the end though to win the bob. SNICKET set up on the inside route after the field had been sent off and
running, was patiently ridden tracking the front runners during the run around the bend, remained on hold stuck in traffic beginning from the general area of
the quarter pole, picked it up so as to slice its way into the two path a sixteenth down the road, got engaged in a spirited tussle with the eventual winner,
whittled away at the deficit, fell short. MOON SWEEPER assumed a forward position, worked out a tuck into the three path after leaving the half mile pole,
pressed the issue, drew directly abreast of the top one as the second split was being finalized, challenged two wide from the top of the lane until the deep
into the furlong grounds, weakened into the show slot. FAVORITE IMPULSE pinched after stutter-stepping its way out of the starting gate, dove onto the two
path well before reaching the conclusion of the backstretch, chased the pace towards the rear of the pack, fanned out into path four from upper to midlane,
lacked a solid closing punch. EQUANT one of the tardiest springing from the gate, stepped onto the turn from path three, got steadied as MOON SWEEPER
was herself being maneuvered into the same path at the top of the turn, got going after suffering a temporary loss of momentum, was still three wide
heading home, failed to fire appreciably. TINY MAGOO gave way after undergoing a two wide pursuit. LOVE THAT FACE rode the rail and faltered.

SPIRIT ANIMAL broke out at the start floating WINNING FACTOR and THREE TECHNIQUE out at minimum a path and forcing WINNING FACTOR to be
briefly steadied and altered inside, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch settled at the tail of the field, tucked three then two wide through
the far turn getting placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just outside the eighth pole, then
edged clear to the finish to prevail. WINNING FACTOR got floated out at the start by SPIRIT ANIMAL and was forced to steady in behind that foe and
altered inwards, chased just off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside at the half mile pole, got set down spinning two to three wide for home, tipped
out straightened away and battled head to head with THREE TECHNIQUE to his outside keeping on to prevail in the battle for the place honors. THREE
TECHNIQUE got floated very slightly outwards at the start by the breaking out SPIRIT ANIMAL, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then
just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and kept on for the show honors.
EPIC BROMANCE broke in at the start bumping CONVICTION TRADE, established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside uncontested
until CONVICTION TRADE latched on five and a half furlongs from home, had that rival advance and tucked inside through the turn coming under increased
pressure placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from the finish, spun just off the inside into upper stretch clinging to command, got displaced by the eventual
winner just outside the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. CONVICTION TRADE bumped at the start by EPIC BROMANCE who broke inwards,
chased three wide in closest aim down the backstretch before advancing on the leader five and a half furlongs from home, tucked to the two path and
advanced to get on near even terms midway on the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, weakened in the late going.

Footnotes
MINE THE COIN remained forwardly placed after coming away without apparent mishap, got guided inward, forced the issue from between opponents from
the top of the bend until its end racing two to three wide, settled onto the head of the stretch and was fed his cue, inched up to the one to catch, drifted out a
bit in the final sixteenth, reacting to some left side stick work, ground its way to victory in the last jump. BIG BOY MO gained a narrow advantage after the
field had been released, slid over closer to the rail leaving the backstretch, showed the way riding the right rim of the inside route feeling pressure from a
pair of foes to his outside, was called upon heading home, saw the top one make steady progress, came out in deep stretch, intentionally or not, from left
side pressure in the last seventy yards, got nipped. BEACH FRONT off a half beat the slowest, advanced into a prominent position, was close enough to the
top twosome so as to vie as the widest of three for command, going about his business from the three path, swung into the lane, kept up its pursuit in
earnest for a little while longer before backing away. OUR AMERICAN STAR off the inside throughout, was coaxed along travelling three wide on the turn,
got sent out into path six from upper to midlane, made no headway in the final stages. I SAW IT ALL underwent a ground-saving journey, was already being
encouraged prior to the quarter pole, stepped into the lane and tired. JUSTICE OF WAR took up position in midpack after being hustled from the gate, raced
in the two path on the turn, spun into the lane, had no rally. FLYING FINISH took up the chase from path two in between rivals on the turn, was on hold
idling behind the front runners beginning from the quarter pole, got asked for some run shortly afterwards, came up empty. NO MORE MIRACLES three
wide entering the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wider, launched no bids. RIGHTDOWNGENTLEMEN strung out four wide on the turn, was moved
out seven wide during the early portion of the stretch, ventured onward as the widest of all.

MAGIC ATTITUDE (GB) away well, got pinched and briefly taken in hand under the wire the first time as KEY BISCAYNE came inwards closing her seam,
settled unhurried at the tail of the field just off the inside through the first turn before taking to the three path down the backstretch, tucked back to the two
path midway down the backstretch remaining patiently handled into the far turn, tipped out three wide three furlongs from home, came under coaxing
nearing the quarter pole and angled out six wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, rallied with a good burst to take command just outside the eighth
pole, then edged clear kept to task. ANTOINETTE established the front shortly after the start and crossed to show the way just off the inside in hand into
and through the first turn, went three then two wide down the backstretch and had KEY BISCAYNE briefly latch on midway, tucked inside half a mile from
home, slipped away given some rein to work with through the latter portion of the turn, spun just off the inside for home, got roused straightened away into
upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole, ran on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. NEIGE BLANCHE (FR)
just off the inside through the opening bend, went three then two wide down the backstretch in aim of the leader settled unhurried near the rear of the
compact field, tipped three wide through the far turn getting placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in
the late stages while safe for the show honors. SETTING THE MOOD a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, tracked the pace along the inside, came
under urging at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. KEY BISCAYNE bobbled twice just after the break and
recovered coming inwards and forcing MAGIC ATTITUDE to be briefly taken in hand when pinched out of her seam under the wire for the initial time, raced
three wide through the first turn in closest aim of the leader before advancing four paths off the inside down the backstretch to latch on that rival midway,
tucked three wide five furlongs from home then to the two path half a mile out into the far turn, came under coaxing in the midst of being shaken off at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final eighth.

Footnotes
LIKEABLE lightly hand urged on the chute establishing the top, remained under some coaxing afterwards, showed the way from along the inside route,
pulling a bit on the left, kicked away from the competition during the final stages of the run around the bend, saw the pilot sitting atop chilly at the quarter
pole, even with the closest pursuers all under drives themselves, slid over to the rail when the rider released his grip on the left side, drew off to a convincing
score, best-described as handily. RATIONAL CHOICE slow to settle into stride, flashed interest approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, tucked along
the rail midway on the turn after effortlessly circling by HIGH KNUCKES, cut the corner under a drive, failed to gain real estate on the confidently-ridden
winner. ENGRAVE two wide and asked for run on the turn, gave way. SIMOVITCH took up position in midpack after the start, was given some rein at the
midway point of the backstretch after appearing keen, pursued the front runners towards the three path on the turn, hand urged, got fully roused by the
five-sixteenths pole, swung into the lane and backed away. HIGH KNUCKLES tracked the front runners while saving ground, wandered out towards path
four after spinning into the stretch with little left.

Footnotes
BATYAH three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, tipped five wide near the midway point on the turn circling rivals and advancing before coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command over a trio
battling a sixteenth from home, then edged away to the finish to prevail. WOW just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, advanced and tipped three wide at
the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, ran on through the stretch to the finish to be along for the
place honors willingly. STONE TOWN tracked the pace just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
three wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. AMORTIZATION (IRE) tracked the pace along the inside from near the rear of the
field, tipped three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the
finish. BRYNBELLA established the front shortly after the break and showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until placed to coaxing
nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a trio through the final furlong getting caught a sixteenth out,
then weakened in the very late stages to the wire. KERRY GIRL three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths,
angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid closing late but was outkicked while showing interest. FRANKEL AT ASCOT (FR) ducked in
sharply at the start and was taken hold of conceding six to seven lengths to the front, chased just off the inside from the tail of the field, came under urging
near the five-sixteenths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. MAGICAL CHARM broke in at the start attempting to
follow the aforementioned foe and fill in the gap and was corrected by the rider, chased along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing five-sixteenths
from home, angled out eight wide at the head of the stretch and tired. BAGS ARE PACKED tracked the pace along the inside in range of the front, came
under a ride five-sixteenths from home, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. ISLAND TREASURE forwardly placed three wide down the
backstretch, went four wide through the turn put to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch in retreat and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
FIGHT ON LUCY took up position in the two path after seemingly getting away in good order, flashed some interest when let out a notch crossing the
midway point of the turn, paused behind others as the half was being completed, angled three wide for entrance into the stretch, steadied after lugging in
momentarily in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, having coming into close proximity of the heels of BLICHTON LADY, tipped out into path five during
the remainder of the run through the furlong grounds for clearance, gained ground with willingness, striking the front end in the shadow of the finish line.
BANKERS DAUGHTER stalked the pace from the three path, was moved out one path wider for the stretch run, forged to the front, saw the top one gaining
ground well, got nailed right near the end. BLITCHTON LADY prompted the pace from path two, got asked for more at the five-sixteenths pole, saw the
runner up take charge in upper stretch, stayed on for the show in the last eighth. FIRENZE FREEDOM guided over to the rail approaching the half mile pole,
rode it to the end of the turn, was shifted to the outside heading onto the top of the lane, wound up approximately seven wide, closed in to secure the final
significant slice of the purse. WAILIN JOSIE got set up in the pocket, was on hold awaiting options as the half was being completed, turned into the lane
with a freshly-created open rail corridor available, ventured onward for another sixteenth though before asked to pick it, failed to do so.
SHESASUPERFREAK retained the advantage after breaking sharply, dove over to the rail, showed the way, feeling some pressure from the outside, got
driven two wide into the lane, relinquished to BANKERS DAUGHTER shortly afterwards and backed away. STRETCHTHESTORY sighted saving ground
early, was under a ride angling into the two path at the three-eighths pole, stepped into the stretch, had no offering. Please note that BLITCHTON LADY ran
for purse money only.

Footnotes
ON THE COUCH sat reserved in the two path in midpack, was on hold forced to draft behind a wall of equines beginning from around the five-sixteenths
pole, tipped wider entering the stretch, acquired clear passage in path four a sixteenth later, responded eagerly when given his cue, began the final furlong
locked in a spirited tussle with the second place finisher, gamely wore that foe down and inched away. FAST GORDON set up in the pocket by the end of
the backstretch, was rated along staying within striking distance of the front runners, gained room with which to launch a rally of his own when FREUDIAN
ANALYST shifted into the two path himself in upper stretch, did just that fighting its way past several foes to emerge at the eighth pole clinging to the
advantage by a narrow margin, got engaged in a duel with top one, battled onward with good determination but had to settle for second. DISCIPLANARIAN
recovered in short order after breaking to the outside, pursued the pace from path four during the run around the bend, swung into the lane about as wider,
got steered wider then had a good finish down the center of the course rallying for the show. FREUDIAN ANALYST vied for command from the rail as the
innermost of three for much of the opening half, moved towards path two when set down for the drive home, released the lead shortly afterwards then
weakened steadily. FALSE ALARM stacked five wide on the turn, was one path farther off the rail during the stretch run, lacked the needed response.
GENERALONAMISSION forwardly placed four wide for a half, commenced the stretch slightly wider, gave way. FOREST SPIRIT checked after taking an
awkward step striking the right side of the starting gate, loped along in path two, got sent out seven wide from upper to midlane, rallied mildly.
YOUSAIDHELLO disputed the pace in path two from between rivals for nearly a half before faltering. STARSHIP EMPIRE taken in hand shying away from
another at the break, dove onto the inside route, went on to save ground to no avail. WHATS IN IT FOR ME hustled from the gate, contended from path
three as the outermost of a trio for the lead until past seven-sixteenths marker, retreated rapidly, stepped into the lane and was allowed to fade farther away
under a protective hold. BEING ME parked five wide on the turn, got roused into the lane, never made its presence felt.
