Footnotes
LOVELY LADY LINDA went to a lone lead, was challenged in the final furlong and found more to prevail. MISS ELIANA stalked between horses early, got
clear of those foes, chased the winner to deep stretch, loomed boldly to mount a serious threat but was a bit rank and turned away while settling for second
best. LUVYASEEYABYE raced toward the back early, went on the move in the five path on the turn and ran on to gain the show spot as best of the rest.
NANA ROZE had an awkward start, raced up close from inside, dropped back nearing the turn and ran evenly while improving position. KAYLEE'S HOPE
stalked from outside two foes, was under the whip on the turn and faltered in the stretch. TICKET OUT was always last and no threat.

Footnotes
WHO'SYOURFAVORITE raced near the back early, floated out wide on the backstretch, rallied in the six path on the turn, drifted out in the stretch and ran
down the leader to get up for the win at the wire. RUN THIS TOWN stalked unhurried, took on the leader in the stretch, got clear for the lead at the sixteenth
pole but was nailed at the wire by the winner. BOOGIE MAN held a reserved lead off the rail, vied with a foe down the stretch and evened out late. HIGLEY
O'PRADO steadied at the start, chased the leaders on the turn and lacked a late rally. POCO CHARLIE was well back early, loomed a threat in upper
stretch and flattened out. MR ZYDECO was no real threat. BOASTFUL DENIAL was up close to the turn and backed up.

SECOND COMING tracked outside of two foes, vied with one on the turn, led in upper stretch and drew away. LADY LAURA led inside, dropped behind two
foes nearing the turn and came again up the rail in the lane for second, though no match for the winner. LORAN HOLIDAY (ARG) pressed the leader early,
went on to vie with the winner on the far turn, was put away by that one and leveled out. SWEET EVY GRACE was unhurried, got close on the the turn and
tired while very wide in the stretch. BURSTING IN AIR was floated out by a foe at the start and not a factor.

RIPROARING slalked just off the leaders, took the three path on the turn and drew off down the stretch. PEARLS IN CHARGE showed speed inside, was
no match for the winner but stubbornly refused to let a foe by for place. SUMMIT POINT raced on the lead with a foe and could not get by that one late to
gain the place spot after both were passed by the winner down the stretch. SWING MUSIC veered in at the start, rallied from inside on the turn but evened
out late. FLAT OUT BEAUTY was off the pace, widest on the backstretch, angled out in upper stretch and improved position late. K FOR KATHY tracked in
hand from third, stayed close in the four path on the turn, was wide in the stretch and faltered. LEGEND BOUND raced in range for a quarter and backed
up.

Footnotes
THIS MAN CAN showed to the front, led off the rail and drew away on the turn to stay clear. GRIND LINE was bumped at the start, stayed off the pace,
quickened on the turn, gained up the rail in the stretch, vied for place and prevailed for that minor award. CAPTAIN RILEY angled off the rail nearing the far
turn while well off the pace, came wide into the stretch and had a late rally in the final furlong. KING CORN chased to the stretch, vied for place and gave
way late. LINDA'S LUCK had an awkward start and bumped a foe, raced off the pace and ran even in the stretch. SIR LEONIDAS needed more rally on the
turn. CALBOYZEKE chased inside, dropped back on the turn and could not keep up.

GIOVANTE in the hunt and dueling from inside all the way, swallowed up at the eighth pole and battled back inside with gutsy effort to prevail on the wire
under stout handling. KALEIDOSCOPE KID just off leaders, ranged up to battle on the lead stayed game through the drive to the wire but outnoodded.
DREAMMEISTER right with leaders to deep stretch, stuck head in front at there eighth pole but outfinished to the wire in a good effort. THE ACCUSER
raced evenly throughout with nothing left in the stretch. LAFLOWMYLAXBRO never in contention. A BIT QUICK with the pace to the half, surrendered and
dropped back. TIZABOUTIME hustled along six wide to first turn but could not keep up. SPRING SOLO had a steady fade after the half.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE showed to the front, backed off the pace in the turn and rallied to edge up on even terms at the wire. GO STORMIN GIRL waited,
split horses in upper stretch, rallied on the rail to close in on the leader, led in deep stretch but was headed by a foe late. GOLDEN STAR LADY rallied on
the turn, led at the top of the stretch, fought in deep stretch for the lead and gave way just before the wire to settle for show. SIMONELA raced mid pack,
was asked on the turn and had a rally in late stretch. CASH CODE chased from last and ran on well late. HEADFIRST raced mid pack and came widest into
the stretch before faltering. DISTINCTIVE FLOWER pressed outside the leader, led on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. FOREIGN EXCHANGE
and GO STORMIN GIRL finished in a dead heat for win.
