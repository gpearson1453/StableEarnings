Footnotes
SHARK CAT was quick to the lead, set the pace off the rail to the stretch then responded determinedly and held. PEQUENO MONTE chased the winner
from the rail to the stretch then finished well but settled for second. HOT SOCKS was also chasing to the turn, came three wide to the stretch then lugged
inward leaving mid stretch, was corrected but missed the place. ON ICE had no speed, saved ground to the stretch then angled out for room in mid stretch
and came on late. BILLTOWN BANNER was outsprinted to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch, was widest in the drive and also was rallying.
CAPACITOR got outrun to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. DESERT MOVIE broke in and bumped
CHARLIE RED RIVER at the start then saved ground to no avail. CHARLIE RED RIVER was bumped by DESERT MOVIE at the start and showed little.

Footnotes
NOVELLA pressed the leader for six furlongs, rallied up to engage for the lead in mid stretch then dug in to edge clear. MYLITTLERUNAWAY set the pace
to the second turn, was collared in mid stretch, resisted to the sixteenth marker then was tiring but saved second. TIZNO'S DILEMMA stalked the winner to
the second turn, was three wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and could not catch MYLITTLERSUNAWAY for the place. FAIRY TALE
BLISS had no speed, settled to the second turn, swung four wide into the stretch and was making some headway late. SPLASHING lagged to the second
turn while off the rail, had to swing out six deep into the stretch but also closed belatedly. SURROUND (IRE) was allowed to settle for a half mile then saved
ground to no avail. MULHIMA (IRE) tracked the pace to the second turn, swung five wide for the drive but weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
CORSICAN pressed the runnerup early, bid three wide to the stretch, rallied to the front leaving mid stretch and edged away driving. LASTBESTHOPE set
the pace to the turn, inched clear to the stretch, could not stall the winner in mid stretch but had enough of a cushion to hold second. BOLD VOYAGER was
outsprinted to the turn then got fanned four wide to the stretch, did not threaten the winner and was too late for second. SILLY IMAGE chased to the turn,
raced two wide to the stretch then came up empty. SHACKEY'S LOVE tracked the leaders to the turn then saved ground to no avail. KODIACTION had no
speed, was two then three wide to the stretch but did not rally. RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT broke a bit slow and was never a threat. THE HENRIETTA chased the
pace three wide to the stretch then tired.

wide to the stretch then responded in the drive but missed second. CANNONBALL COMIN had the best speed, set the pace off the rail to the stretch but
was caught in mid stretch and weakened. LIL AWECIM had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch but could not threaten in the drive. DRINK TIL YOU
DROP trailed from the rail to the stretch and did not offer a closing response. AMBER LOUISE chased the pace early, was three wide to the stretch then
weakened in mid stretch. OH BE ONE had no speed, raced three wide but was also not a factor. NUTTY SIERRA got outsprinted to the turn, bid three wide
but weakened in the final furlong.

four wide to the stretch and finished in a rally. HOT SOUP set the pace two wide to the stretch, inched away to mid stretch but was tiring late. CANDY

Footnotes
OASIS had no speed, settled to the second turn, advanced inside to get on terms in mid stretch then drifted out under constant left handed whipping but
held on desperately. TEMBO also had no speed, was mid pack to the second turn, came three then four wide to the stretch, rallied in the late stages then
bumped FRAVEL in the last jump. FRAVEL was outrun for a half mile, circled rivals five wide to the stretch then was closing determinedly and got bumped
by TEMBO in the last jump. K P D DAY was five wide to the backstretch, stalked the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch then dug in
late but was being outfinished and had to take up off of the winner's heels. FLICKERING LIGHT set the pace to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch
then was caught in mid stretch and outfinished. ZAHRA pressed the pace to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch then weakened in the drive.
RAILSPLITTER trailed to the second turn, was five wide to the stretch and closed the gap in the lane. EXETER was forced out six deep on the first turn,
tracked to the half, was four wide to the stretch then weakened. INFATUATE chased the pace for a half mile, was off the rail while being outrun to the
stretch and weakened. WILD BOAT RIDE settled mid pack while saving ground, remained inside to the stretch but gave way in the drive. PARADISE
FOREVER had no speed and was not a factor. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run involving OASIS and K P D DAY but although OASIS
did force K P D DAY to take up late, in a majority decision, the stewards ruled that the incident did not cost K P D DAY a better placing and no change was
made.

allowed to settle to the half, rallied three wide on the second turn and finished willingly. INVERTIGO also settled for a half mile, came two wide to the stretch
then could not offer the needed late response. RATE FOR ME was four wide to the backstretch, chased to the second turn then saved ground to the stretch
but did not rally. AIGLE trailed to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch and did not threaten. CALL ME SOUL had no speed, settled to the second
turn, was two then three wide to the stretch and came up empty. HARDY CHISEL set the pace from the rail for five furlongs then was collared and tired in
the drive. ARCH ANTHEM was five wide early, chased to the half, tried to rally four deep on the second turn but also tired.
