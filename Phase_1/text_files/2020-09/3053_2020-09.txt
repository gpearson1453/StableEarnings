urging but could not reach the winner. MOVIN TIMBER stumbled breaking outward from the gate and gained quickly outside late to earn show honors.
FIRST TO CLEAR stumbled leaving the gate and rallied belatedly but missed out. RJ FLY BYE some early speed and weakened from the rail in the late
stages. ROLLING TIMBER lacked a clear path early, angled inward and yielded.

LITTLE NEW YORK trailed the field early, advanced quickly through the final turn in the two path, responded to intermittent handling into the drive, angled
out mid stretch while closing steadily on the leader and was up just in time. CAGEY sat in striking position inside, moved up alongside SALTY O'DAY to
challenge the lead while three wide, drove clear into the stretch and was nipped at the wire. SALTY O'DAY sat just off the pace while four wide through the
backstretch, inherited the lead into the far turn, was overtaken at the quarter pole then went evenly through the drive and just held show placing. YUKON
MIST saved ground on the lead, was overtaken nearing the half, chased outside into the lane, kept on evenly and missed. METERS MEMORY trailed and
never reached contention. IBROX GIRL raced in close quarters through the opening turn, chased five wide and was done early. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An
objection lodged by the rider of SALTY O'DAY against the rider of CAGEY alleging interference at the top of the stretch was not allowed after review of the
Stewards. No change to the order of finish.

encouragement, improved through the drive and got up for the place. BIONIC BIRD clear the lead to secure a position just off the rail, held good margins
into the final turn but saw them diminish quickly nearing the three sixteenth, was overtaken mid stretch and was edged out late. CHISUM G hustled inside
early, checked in close quarters at the five sixteenth pole and was unable to improve through the drive. PEYTONS PRINCE settled four to five wide early
and lacked a bid. OIL CHANGE trailed throughout. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of CHISUM G against the rider of LIPAN

ALBERTA BOUND settled in stride, saved ground just off the rail through the backstretch, swung out four wide at the head of the lane, gained the lead with
a furlong remaining and drove clear. RUN JEANNE RUN fanned three wide into the opening turn, dueled outside of LUCKY LAST NIGHT leaving the
backstretch, dug in between rivals when confronted with challengers into the stretch but was out finished. DOMENICO lagged early, chased through the far
turn taking closer order, rallied inside a foe to gain the show. LUCKY LAST NIGHT prompted the pace inside, dueled through the far turn, was under attack
into the stretch and lacked the rally required. STEELFORCE sat in range while three to four wide through the backstretch, dropped back through the final
turn and lacked a closing response. PATRICK trailed and offered a late mild bid. SILENT EMISSARY race four wide through the first turn, sat in striking
range and had nothing left in reserve for the drive.

Footnotes
SMALL VICTORIES chased five wide into the backstretch, drove four wide nearing the quarter pole, gained the lead at the head of the stretch and won
driving. INDICATIVE dueled inside leaving the opening turn then settled just off the pace through the backstretch, uncoiled a bid into the lane, angled out but
was unable to stall the winner. BOLSANO raced at the back of the pack, chased wide into the lane and rallied steadily to earn show. MOROCCAN
WARRIOR slow to stride from the gate, saved ground in the backstretch and rallied belatedly. CASH REWARD reserved off the early pacesetters, shifted
out to the four path through the backstretch then moved up to dispute the pace, lodged a bid between foes but was unable to sustain the bid that was
required. SUPER INDIAN (FR) vied for the early lead between foes, contended the pace through the backstretch, gained a short advantage into the far turn
and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. KIWITAHI sent for early speed, prompted the pace under a strong hold, gained a slim advantage over foes
through the backstretch, came under coaxing into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
CHICOUT D'TIGER led the field through the backstretch while four wide, drifted outward at the head of the lane, responded to pressure into the stretch and
drove clear. LYLA LORRAINE tracked inside, uncoiled a rail bid into the stretch and was along in time for place. SOMETHING ABOUT ME sat in striking
position outside, loomed boldly nearing the quarter pole, chased into the stretch but was no match for the winner and was edged out late. BONITA RAPIDS
sat mid pack from the three path and lacked response when called upon. LEENA outrun throughout. ANSTRUM saved ground inside, was asked to quicken
leaving the final turn and wilted through the stretch. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY tracked wide through the backstretch and failed to menace.
