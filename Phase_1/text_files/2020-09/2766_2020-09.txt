wire. ONE SLICK CHICK stalked the early pace, raced four wide through the lane and had not enough late. ASPEN ROSE was unhurried early, raced four
wide at the quarter pole and had no rally. CAR LADY was slow in the early stages, saved ground and never was a factor.

NO ONE TO BLAME stalked the pace, moved up three wide at the eighth marker and finished well to be clear late under steady handling. GUN LAW
stumbled at the break, was unhurried early, moved up four wide nearing the quarter pole but was no match for the winner late. KAKE'SCHARMINGBOY
showed good early speed along the inside and weakened a bit through the drive. RECYCLE broke awkwardly, was slow early, saved ground and never was
a serious threat. CORRIGAN stalked the pace while racing between rivals down the backstretch and tired. SEA CAPTAIN was allowed to settle early and
failed to respond.
