but was passed late. NICE BROWN GIRL raced in mid pack, chased from the rail and two-wide on the far turn and finished under a determined drive.
BOSSALINA, bumped at the start, settled off the pace, came two to four-wide through the far turn then rallied belatedly. COMIC KITTEN broke outward,
raced in mid pack, was hustled four then three-wide on the far turn then failed to menace. BOBBI'S LEGACY, off slowly, moved up quickly to force the pace
on the first turn, backed away on the far turn and lacked a rally. MOKSGMOL stalked the pace, dropped back early on the far turn, was hustled along but
lacked a rally. MISS ARIEL stalked early then pressed the pace late backstretch, was hustled on the turn but flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
EMPIRE ANGEL won the break and sprinted clear into the first turn, was stalked by a rival down the backside and the far turn before opening up a clear
advantage as the field turned for home, maintaining that lead while being kept to her task down the lane. SARATOGA VISION settled along the rail in mid
pack early, dropped back to off the pace into the far turn before rallying into the four path at the top of the stretch and sprinting into the place position, no
match for the long gone winner. BUTTERED TOAST was four to two wide through the first turn, circled the field two to five wide on the far turn before drifting
out into the seven path into the stretch, closing down the outside for the show position in the final sixteenth. JUST PLAYING settled off the pace while three
to two wide on the first turn, moved up four wide on the far turn into contention and fanned out into the six path at the top of the stretch, inching up late for a
minor award. KEEPME IN THEGAME steadied between rivals into the first turn, moved up two to three wide on the far turn to look dangerous by the quarter
pole but stalled a furlong out. SHES THE NORTH was rank and steadying through the first turn and early backstretch, settled down to chase in behind the
front runner but had nothing left for the stretch drive, dropping back down the lane. L'AMOUR TOUJOURS was four to three wide moving up to stalk out of
the first turn, stayed three wide outside the leaders into the far turn before dropping back from the quarter pole to the wire. SUPER JADE was four to three
wide around the first turn near the rear, asked for run along the inside on the far turn but had no response. GLORIANNIA was three to two wide stalking the
winner around the first turn and up to the quarter pole but retreated from there to the wire.

hustled two to five-wide on the far turn then rallied full out. SPANISH RIVER stalked the pace, chased angling from the rail to four-wide on the far turn then
lacked a closing response. CONQUEST ELIMINATR broke in the air and settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the far turn but

Footnotes
SHANGHAI KIMMY dueled on the backstretch and took a short lead on the turn, dashed away at the top of the stretch, widened, then was all out to hold
CEDAR VALLEY safe. CEDAR VALLEY, off slowly but in range angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, launched a full out stretch drive, gained
steadily and just missed. LOST CORSAGE was off slowly, moved up and pressed the pace, chased along the rail through the turn but evened out in the
stretch. TRAIL BLAZING ESSA broke slowly, raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn then finished gamely to no avail. QUEEN LICIA was
also off slowly, stalked the pace, chased three-wide late turn but was left behind by the leader at the top of the stretch and evened out. HONEY GIRL
pressed the pace, was pinched back and checked early on the turn, was hustled along but failed to menace. MAHONE BAY broke alertly, dueled, forced the
issue on the turn, chased into the stretch and had no closing response. LADY DYNAMITE lost her path just out of the gate, settled off the pace, angled in
from three-wide to the rail through the turn but lacked a rally. ALOHA WILKO raced in mid pack, dropped back late turn then flattened out in the stretch.

MARWOODS WAR stalked the pace, came two and three-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch, rallied smartly and got up late under a light
drive. MARCH OF DREAMS steadied at the outset and settled off the pace, closed from the rail on the far turn, had command in the final furlong but failed
to hold the winner safe. DAY DAYENU showed early speed, was joined in a duel, gained a narrow advantage on the backstretch, set a pressured pace to
late turn then shook clear at the top of the stretch, was all out but was passed and had to settle for the show position. ETERNAL PEACE dueled on the first
turn, forced the pace on the backstretch and turn then flattened out in the stretch. LAKE MANITOU broke outward and settled in mid pack, was hustled
angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, was pinched back approaching the top of the stretch and evened out. VESPOLINA raced in mid pack, was
hustled five-wide on the turn but offered no response in the stretch. SPECIAL HONOR settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn but was never
in contention. FOREST HALO, pinched back at the start, raced in mid pack, closed on the backstretch, was hustled through the turn then evened out in the
stretch.

Footnotes
RED QUEEN'S COURT pressed the pace on the backstretch then stalked the quickening leader on the turn, chased into the stretch, bid a furlong out and
prevailed under a drive. PURPLE SCOOTER led into the turn and moved clear, set the pace, was collared a furlong out, battled, but gave way grudgingly.
SAVVY'S SISTER stalked the pace, moved in to the rail late turn and was all out to the wire. ROCHE'S POINT pressed the pace, came three-wide through
the turn then chased gamely to the wire. MUSKOKA DANCER showed brief speed, was pinched back early turn and veered out while nearly being
unseated, moved back inward and was hustled from the rail to two-wide, angled out a bit upper stretch and rallied outside. YOU CANT CATCH HER settled
in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn then evened out in deep stretch. MINE FAST PHILLY, in range, was forced inward early turn, rode the rail,
was blocked upper stretch and finished gamely. MUSTN'T GRUMBLE, off slowly, stalked the pace, appeared to have been bumped and forced to check
early turn then finished evenly. BOATLOADOFNERVE was pinched back at the outset and settled off the pace, closed late turn but failed to menace.
ORBORTUNISTIC raced in mid pack, was steadied and veered out early turn, closed five and six-wide on the turn but evened out in the stretch.
SHOTNABEER raced in mid pack, came four and five-wide through the turn but lacked a rally. LIGHT IT UP, taken back early, was hustled two-wide on the
turn, angled out upper stretch but failed to threaten. WUK UP QUEEN was taken off the early pace, moved inward from three-wide to the rail on the turn
then flattened out in the stretch. THERE WERE SEVERAL CLAIMS OF FOULS LODGED BY JOCKEYS INCLUDING MUSKOKA DANCER AGAINST
MINE FAST PHILLY AND SAVVY'S SISTER ON ROCHE'S POINT, ALL FOR INTERFERENCE EARLY ON THE TURN, BUT BECAUSE A BACK TOWER
CAMERA WAS INOPERABLE AND THERE WAS NO CLEAR VIEW THE STEWARDS WERE UNABLE TO MAKE A JUDGEMENT AND WERE FORCED
TO DISMISS THE CLAIMS.
