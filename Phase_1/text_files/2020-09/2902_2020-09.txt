Footnotes
JARETH broke through the starting gate pre start, was well placed early, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane,
made a steady gain and edged up late. GLENNWOOD well placed and outside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid between rivals into the
stretch, then lacked the needed late kick. PEANUTS PERFECTION sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch,
then weakened late and held the show. JEN'S SONG never far back, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through inside into the stretch,
then could not gain and held a share. THIRSTY BETRAYAL ran evenly. CALORIC allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid
three wide into the lane and improved position. LESS THAN PERFECT chased the pace on the inside and steadily lost ground. FAMOUS N FLASHY broke
through the starting gate pre start, then lunged at the break and was no factor. CHIC N WILBUR well placed, moved up four wide through the turn, fanned
widest into the lane and had no rally.
