GRASSHOPPIN prompted the pace outside, took over after three quarters and edged off following a long drive. METAPHORICAL set the pace along the
rail, vied through the final turn and held on gamely. DIAMOND SETTER lagged far behind then closed the gap outside too late. AMERICAN ROMA was
taken up into the first turn then flattened out in the stretch. ARMAMENT raced close up wide for half a mile and retreated. MIAMI TIGER saved ground close
up and gradually faded. WINDOW TABLE was crowded between rivals at the start and dropped far behind. IMMUNITY trailed early and was never in
contention. K D'S CAT BIRD chased in mid-pack and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
SON OF DARKNESS broke sharply after an extremely long gate load, set pace in the three path, shook loose and was clear mid stretch and then
maintained a safe lead under strong handling. BRAZEN saved ground early then was eased back slightly and moved off the rail, chased, fell back mid
stretch but then was coming back. DOUGIE saved ground just off the pace and lacked a strong kick. LOUIE'S WISH ducked out sharply, eventually moved
to the rail, drifted out through stretch and didn't threaten. RISING STORM saved ground just off the pace and faded. JUMP SHOT was very wide, was
carried wider into stretch and wasn't a threat. ANOTHER SMARTY, very wide, failed to menace. MIRROR MIRROR broke slowly, raced wide and bore out
into stretch. FINN'S POSSE was unruly loading then showed nothing. ASBURY AVE never threatened.

SLINGIN SAMMY B firmly rated inside, moved boldly on the turn, angled out and edged away through the final eighth. LOVE ON FIRE vied between rivals
early, rallied clear briefly in the stretch but was outfinished. GOSSIP ISLE alternated for the lead inside then came up empty in the stretch.
SHE'SMYRISENSTAR broke sluggishly, moved up inside and continued willingly while no threat. STORMBEAM stalked the pacesetters outside and
weakened on the turn. TOWSON dropped back early then passed fading rivals. SEEKING SHAMROCKS lacked speed and was never in contention. HAY

Footnotes
COLORADO GRANDSLAM set the pace inside, drifted out through the stretch and won under strong handling. MIDNIGHT GAMES saved ground early,
moved out on the turn, drifted wider through stretch and couldn't gain. FOREST RIVER raced three wide on the turn, challenged but then flattened out.
PEGASUS RED raced between rivals while not far back then had no rally. SUNRISE SATURDAY, outrun early, split rivals on the turn and failed to menace.
SHAFT OF LIGHT prompted the early pace two wide then tired. REIGNING WARRIOR fell far back after the start then passed faders. R JOLLEY
DREAMER, very wide, showed little. LUNAR ROVER saved ground and failed to menace. MY PIRATE, two wide and just off the pace, stopped.
MARRIAGE FEVER was never a factor.

Footnotes
DIG CHARLIE DIG advanced inside, angled out in advancing in the stretch then wore down the pacesetter in the final stride. OUR PHILLY SPECIAL hustled
to the front inside, extended his lead on the turn, remained clear in mid stretch but was nailed at the wire. ACED chased off the pace in the two path then
flattened out through the stretch. IRISH MEADOW lagged far behind inside, swung very wide in the stretch with late energy. READY AND RICH lacked
speed, moved inside and failed to threaten. GREAT GO GO prompted the leaders four wide down the backstretch and faltered. FIVE MORE MINUTES
hustled close up three wide then steadied tiring on the turn. MISSION OBERON lacked speed and was always far behind. WILL'S PIONEER forced the
pace outside then gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
PENANCE took control early, widened without urging on the final turn, maintained a long advantage and was taken under wraps late. JANELLE DREAMS
lacked speed, advanced inside to the stretch, angled out but was no match for the winner. MIDNIGHT BOUNTY chased very wide for half a mile then
flattened out in the stretch. THEODOSIA eased back and to the outside after a quarter, pursued the winner and faded. HALLUCINATION dropped back
inside and was always outrun. BRYCE'S PHILLY chased three wide for half a mile and gave way readily. FRIDAY MASS was urged just off the leaders
briefly then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
BRILLIANT CHASE broke slowly, was hustled up in the four path, looped the field near stretch, took over and drew off. SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS, racing in the
three path, went four wide near stretch and fought gamely for place. BARCODE, between foes, was boxed in on the far turn, squeezed through a small
opening between rivals entering the stretch and fought gamely. SCREEN SAVER raced inside, stuck his lead in front near quarter pole but then weakened
late. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN hit the right side of gate breaking slowly, moved out on the turn and then swung very wide into stretch. STAY HYDRATED vied
for command just off the rail then tired. GEEBERT, very wide, failed to menace.

LOAN ME YOUR EAR saved ground throughout, took the lead near stretch and pulled away under a drive. BOAT OVER THE HILL, just off the rail, split
foes after a half and then challenged three wide near stretch but was no match. SYNERGIZED set the pace in the four path, allowed winner to rally inside
and dropped back. SURFER BOY GEORGE raced two wide and tired badly. DONNIE BRASCO, wide and just off the pace, dropped back to last, then
came back to pass faders. SILVERZAR prompted the pace in the five path then tired. SINCERE MAN saved ground and showed little. KINGSVILLE
stumbled badly as the horses left the starting gate twenty five minutes past scheduled post time and unseated his rider.
