Footnotes
C'EST MARDI raced off the pace inside, bid three wide on the turn, dug in gamely outside of PIONEEROF NEW YORK passing the furlong marker, battled
it out with that rival and surged late to get the nod. PIONEEROF NEW YORK chased the pacesetter, took over nearing the far turn, dug in gamely inside of
the winner in the final furlong and just missed. MISS BOB raced off the pace, moved up on the far turn, rallied three wide into the lane and closed mildly
outside. LAST GREAT raced off the pace inside, steadied to avoid a quickly tiring rival at the three eighths marker, came two wide into the lane, angled out
and closed belatedly. PORT SALERNO was outrun early, moved up three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. PEGGY
O'PRADO was outrun early, moved up inside on the backside, steadied to avoid a rival at the three eighths marker, then raced inside and had no rally.
CLASSY LYNN settled off the pace, moved up, bid two wide on the far turn and faded. VALERIE FIRST did not factor. OCEAN CONQUEST was fractious in
the gate, then had the rider lose the irons at the start and never recover them, showed speed to set the pace, gave way past the half mile marker, was
pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

PIRATE'S PUNCH settled off the pace racing two wide in a stalking position, moved up nearing the far turn, made a strong three wide bid on the turn, took
charge at the quarter pole, kicked clear under urging in the lane and was kept to the task until the final strides when the rider stood up in celebration. TOP
LINE GROWTH raced off the pace outside a rival, bid four wide on the far turn, rallied four wide into the lane, dug in gamely in the final furlong and held on
determinedly for the place award. BAL HARBOUR raced off the pace with an inside trip, saved ground waiting for room midway on the turn, came two wide
into the lane, rallied on the rail, dug in gamely and missed for second. NAME CHANGER raced four wide early, trailed the field, moved up three wide on the
far turn, four wide past the quarter pole, came five wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. GOLDEN BROWN raced three wide early, settled off the
pace three wide, came four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) showed good early speed to set the pace, opened up a
clear lead, dueled inside on the far turn and faded. PRENDIMI chased on the inside, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled and faded. VALID POINT had
a three wide trip racing off the pace and gave way.

into the lane, rallied inside and dug in gamely inside in deep stretch to prevail. RUNABOUT raced off the pace, off the rail, moved up three wide on the far
turn, four wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside into the stretch, dug in gamely in the final sixteenth but came up second best. GENERAL BELLAMY
stalked two wide, bid three wide entering the far turn, dueled past the quarter pole and dug in gamely between rivals in the final furlong. REGAL QUALITY

stalked three wide, bid four wide on the far turn, dueled past the quarter pole and tired. SPIN CYCLE dueled inside for the lead, battled inside on the
