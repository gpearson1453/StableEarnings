Footnotes
QUICK LEARNER quickly took control inside, repelled challenges then remained safe while kept to a drive. JACK O LIAM rushed to contention in the two
path, bid on the turn, was repelled by the winner but continued willingly. TRUSTING FRIEND angled wide on the turn then closed well through the stretch.
DRAXHALL WOODS lacked speed, moved wide in the stretch with some late energy. THE ITALIAN chased wide down the backstretch and lacked a rally.
FREE FOR NOTHING saved ground within striking range and began fading on the turn. DOWN WITH THE KING broke sluggishly and trailed throughout
losing contact with his field. As per ruling 20130PP from the Pa Racing Commission, Quick Learner was dq'ed for a positive test.

SPECTACULAR NOW set the pace three wide under rating, edged clear after a half and won under mild handling. PASATIME, between rivals early, moved
out wide on the final turn, drifted wider and had no late gain. SHES EUPHORIC raced very wide and failed to menace. SOPHIA KATE, inside, passed tiring
foes. GOLD RUSH KIZZIE saved ground and tired. MEGALOMANIA saved ground in top flight then stopped. GUMDROP'S CHICLET was outside dueling
for the early lead then stopped. TIBERIAN EMPRESS raced wide and stopped.

menacing. MIDNIGHT SKY chased outside, moved briefly closer on the turn then weakened. CHANCEE set a pressured pace inside, moved clear on the

Footnotes
BREW DOG, racing in the four path, drifted wider racing into stretch, closed, taking the lead near the sixteenth marker and quickly drew off in a much
improved effort. GALLIC WAR set the pace inside, relinquished the lead near mid stretch but fought back gamely to regain place. GAUCHO came in and
bumped rival leaving the gate, stalked two wide, took the lead near furlong grounds, drifted out and hung. PIGGYBANK bobbled then came out leaving the
gate causing crowding, raced out from the rail and tired. MIGHTY MARK hesitated at the start, and then showed little. GOSLEY, three wide and just off the
pace, tired. COMMISSIONER DAVE, bumped leaving the gate, was never a serious threat. NAUGHTY FOX was forced out then steadied leaving the gate
then raced very wide. MOSSBAWN was jostled leaving the gate and never threatened.

SHANGHAI SUPERFLY settled wide just off the pace, bid to the front near the quarter pole, battled the remainder of the trip in a game effort. PETULANT
DELIGHT set a measured pace under a rating hold, was collared on the final turn, and faded. TACTICAL PURSUIT (IRE) prompted the leader in the two
path for five furlongs and weakened. STARLING PRINCE angled inside early, raced close up to the far turn then stopped.

Footnotes
CARAMEL CREAM saved ground just off the pace, angled out four wide on the turn, closed strongly through the stretch taking the lead near the sixteenth
pole and won going away. TAPETE CLAIRE, in the five path while just off the pace, moved in on the turn, took the lead near quarter pole, relinquished the
lead but fought back for place. GOSSIP ISLE, bumped leaving the gate, was three wide early and then two wide on the turn, took the lead near mid stretch
and held on well. FILLUPCOHENSAPIKER broke slowly, raced between rivals on turn and through stretch and finished well. KAREN'S GEM came out at
the start causing bumping and crowding, took up sharply trying to split rivals near the end of the backstretch, eased out and had no rally. SILVER EXCESS
was wide and just off the pace, tired. ROSE OF DUBLIN failed to menace. AUSSIE MIST, bumped leaving the gate, recovered and was sent up to set the
pace before tiring. SALLY O'PRADO broke slowly and saved ground. LOOKINGFORANEWSPOT stumbled badly leaving the gate, was wide and outrun.

CHAMPAGNE CHUCK stalked the pace two wide, was headed on the final turn, fought back and regained the lead in deep stretch then lasted. DRUMMER
DON, outrun three then two wide, angled out very wide into stretch and finished strongly to just miss. PRINTER vied for command three wide, took the lead
on the final turn, battled gamely and weakened slightly. MARQ ONE, two wide early, eased out through the stretch but was too late. WORTH HIS SALT
saved ground disputing the early pace then tired. DIAMOND SQUARE, in the four path and just off the pace, tired. NOBLE KENT saved ground just off the
pace then tired. METAPHORICAL broke slowly, saved ground and never threatened. BANKER'S ISLAND, between rivals early, was left with the rail near
half mile and failed to menace. BACKSTRETCH GEORGE showed little.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT BEAUTIFUL settled at the back of the pack for five furlongs, surged near the inside and quickly rallied clear in the final furlong. FOREST FIRE
set a clear pace to the stretch then weakened slightly. RUBY BLEU was fanned wide early, raced close up outside, loomed a threat and continued willingly.
SEMI EXCITED dropped back early, split foes into the far turn then flattened out. MOON GATE WARRIOR settled wide off the leaders and faded after five
furlongs. HIT IT ONCE MORE saved ground,moved briefly closer before half a mile then gave way. OPTIC WAY was urged close up inside early then
stopped abruptly. BOJINGLE hustled just off the leader between rivals and gave way readily.

Footnotes
MIRROR MIRROR, didn't break sharply, was hustled up between rivals and then moved to the outside to be just off the pace, drifted in taking the lead near
mid stretch and just held on. GRAY LITTLE MEADOW dueled for command along the rail and fought gamely to wire. AFLEET MELODY, outrun while wide,
continued outside and finished fast. LITTLE LATER broke slowly, was hustled up along the rail, moved out and lacked a strong closing bid. BULLZILLA
dueled for command two wide and faded late. TICKED ALL DABOXES raced wide and failed to be a serious threat. HURACAN raced wide and never
threatened. ODDS ARE broke slowly, raced just off the rail and never threatened. STRATEGIC LEGACY was wide and had only brief speed. THIN
SPACES, between rivals and just off the pace, tired. METALLIC TUNE showed nothing.
