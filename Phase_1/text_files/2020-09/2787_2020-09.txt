Footnotes
BLUEFIELD chased the pace outside INSPIRED GEM, overtook that one near the quarter pole then drew out under brisk urging. POSITIVE FORCE
hugged the inner rail on the turn, angled to the three path approaching the stretch and rallied. INSPIRED GEM sprinted to the early lead, hugged the inner
rail around the turn and steadily retreated through the stretch. GLORIOUSLY , four deep on the turn, steadily dropped back through the stretch. RIVER
TRAPPE stumbled badly leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, eased out for the drive and was not a factor. YIRA chased the very early pace
and was done before reaching the turn.

Footnotes
BELFOUR vied three deep around the first turn, emerged in a tussle with OLDFASHIONED CLUB leaving the five eighths, spurted away into the far turn,
dropped in some and dictated, came under some coaxing into the lane, kept on under a drive past the furlong grounds then held firm while allowed to coast
the final yards. MIDNIGHT ACT sparred between runners through the opening five sixteenths, rated back and stalked past the five eighths, came under
pressure while chasing outside a rival leaving the three eighths, came back on with good energy in the final furlong and out kicked GENERAL PADDY for
the place. GENERAL PADDY chased outside a rival, angled further out after six furlongs, circled four wide under pressure into the lane, advanced outside
MIDNIGHT ACT inside the sixteenth marker but hung late. BOBBY G saved ground pursuing the leaders, was under a solid ride around the final turn, eased
out entering the lane but lacked a bid. OLDFASHIONED CLUB dueled inside a pair of foes through the opening quarter mile, battled with the winner past the
five eighths, failed to match strides heading to the far turn, gave willing chase to about the quarter pole then wilted.

Footnotes
EXTREMELYEXCLUSIVE bobbled at the break, recovered and took to rating while in range of a contested early pace, edged up between foes while
confidently ridden past the three eighths, bid three deep to engage the leaders with a quarter to go, was nudged clear in upper stretch and widened in handy
fashion. MORE TWIRL settled well back, came under pressure mid turn, angled out in the drive and churned on while on his left lead and gained the place
in the final yards. I'D LIKE TO KNOW prompted outside the leader, dueled around the turn, raced between runners into the lane, failed to keep pace past
mid stretch and faded. MALIBU HEAVEN saved ground in range, awaited some room mid turn, altered out for room entering the lane but failed to kick on.
MAN UP DUDE , three deep chasing the pace, weakened. RUNAWAY STAR grabbed command early towards the inside, set a pressured pace, dueled mid
turn to the head of the lane then weakened.

Footnotes
CHARM CITY BAND sped to the early lead, set the pace well off the rail and was kept to his business in the drive. OFFICER COUNTRY bobbled at the
break, circled horses around the turn, drifted to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. DREAMING OF CARATS bore in leaving the
starting gate, chased the winner, saved ground on the turn, eased out for the drive, raced erratically in mid stretch and weakened. CHAUFFEUR , outrun,
was wide turning for home. DESHACKLED chased the pace,r aced two wide on the turn and faltered. NEVERHAVENEVERWILL , pinched back leaving the
starting gate, raced along the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor.

FIVE CARD DRAW settled off the inside, angled five wide advancing into the lane, rolled past the dueling leaders in mid stretch and drew clear under a
drive. SING A VERSE , off the pace while saving ground, steadied near the far turn, regrouped and edged up behind foes nearing the stretch, dropped in to
the rail and bid inside runners nearing mid stretch, threatened for the lead, faded late but managed to save the place. WINSTON'S WAY broke slowly,
lagged well back, angled out in the drive and got past tiring rivals. EL ROJO saved ground while outrun early, eased out for the drive and lacked a solid
finish. TALENTED DR. B , taken to rate early, advanced three to four wide mid turn, bid to challenge between horses in mid stretch, failed to kick on from
there and gave way. CHUCK'S DREAM stalked the leader, took closer order two to three wide heading to the quarter pole, vied between runners past the
three sixteenths, drifted in and bumped with FIRST IN SHOW then gave way. FIRST IN SHOW was gunned clear early, set a strong pace towards the
inside, raced two wide while joined into the lane, bumped with CHUCK'S DREAM while between rivals in mid stretch then weakened. NATION U S A , wide,
was outrun.

G MAN set the pace slightly off the rail, opened up leaving the turn and lasted under urging. CREATED SPECIAL bumped with CECIL THE LION leaving
the starting gate, moved up on the turn, chased the winner and raced erratically most of the final furlong. NIC NIC BOOM lacked speed, raced between
horses and passed tired ones. ELUSIVE MOTION chased the pace three wide on the turn and gave way. THREE CHOPT PUNCH , along the inner rail
most of the race was not a factor. CECIL THE LION bumped with CREATED SPECIAL leaving the starting gate and was outrun. FAVOR MAKER circled the
turn, drifted out badly in upper stretch and weakened. KING PACAY , wide on the turn, was not a factor.

CAROLINA ICE , reserved outside a rival as the leading pair dueled into the turn, came under some asking mid turn, circled four wide into the lane, closed
steadily under left handed encouragement and forged ahead in the final yards. MAYBE AN OMEN dueled inside into the turn, rated back off of NIGHTLIFE
as that one cleared past the three eighths, gave hard pursuit three wide into the lane and came back between rivals to earn a dead heat for the place.
NIGHTLIFE vied outside MAYBE AN OMEN, secured command leaving the far turn then opened up without much asking, remained well clear under a drive
past the eighth pole, drifted out late, failed to last but got a perfect bob to be on even terms for second. GOLDEN CAN , rated back from between runners at
the break, saved ground and weakened.

Footnotes
SILENT MALICE assumed the early lead, set a slow pace in the two path, drifted out turning for home, was under a brisk hand ride in mid stretch, raced on
his left lead the final sixteenth of a mile while not being urged. GHOST ON A MISSION saved ground around the turn, remained along the inner rail in the
stretch and gained the place. HARD STING stumbled soon after the break when appearing to clip the heels of GHOST ON A MISSION, circled the turn four
wide and failed to rally. ZEN PI , three wide chasing the winner to the stretch, weakened.
