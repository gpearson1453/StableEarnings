Footnotes
JUST FLY was away in good order, set the pace along the inside, shook clear into the stretch and widened. ALL FACT settled saving ground, got through
and finished willingly, but failed to menace the winner. LIL MISS HOT MESS tracked to the outside of JUST FLY through the turn, weakened entering the
stretch, but stayed on to preserve the minor award. PROUDLY FOUGHT was close up three wide through the turn and faltered. SHE WANTS MORE settled
off of the inside, fanned out five wide but lacked a response when called upon. WAR BALLAD showed little.

Footnotes
ALLEGE attended pace tucked in along the rail, moved up and out through the second turn, came five wide, reeled in the leader and kicked away.
MULBERRY STREET was away alertly, settled off the lead along the rail, split horses and forged a narrow lead nearing the quarter pole, edged clear into
the lane, kept on but was unable to resist the winner. AWAKENED broke a step slow, moved into contention four wide, came to level terms nearing the
quarter pole, but weakened and settled for the show. LEADING WEST was allowed to settle, came five wide but failed to make headway. GOOD JUJU
contended between horses to the second turn and tired. DECISION MAKER worked his way to the lead through the stretch the first time through, angled in
to set the pace, was collared leaving the second turn and gave way. JACK LUVS NOVA stopped and was distanced through the stretch.

FROSTED PRAYER opened clear to dictate terms and remained unchallenged. SMOOTH MUSIC veered in at the start, stacked up a trio of runners,
chased three wide, fought on through a long drive and was all out to earn the place. TWO WORLDS broke slow, was allowed to settle, tucked in on the turn,
moved out into the stretch, altered back to the inside and continued on well. SOUTHERN WILL was bothered at the start, moved up along the inside, tipped
out leaving the turn to make his bid, but failed to sustain the drive. ULTIMATE IRONY settled off of the inside, finished with a belated gain but failed to
threaten. AUTHORITARIAN hopped at the start, settled along the inside but lacked a response when called upon. OKUDAH was close up through through
the turn and faltered. COWARDLY ACT broke slow, moved up between runners, stopped before going a half, pulled up inside the furlong marker but walked
off. The jockey of SOUTHERN WILL lodged an objection against SMOOTH MUSIC for alleged interference out of the gate, but following the Stewards
review there was no changed to the order of finish.

RY'S THE GUY set the pace under a snug hold toward the inside, drifted out a bit leaving the final turn, inched out a clear lead, dug in under stern urging
and gamely led throughout. RATED R SUPERSTAR attended the pace along the inside, got through and kicked on but was unable to reach the winner.
ESKENFORIT tracked outside RY'S THE GUY under a tight hold, disputed the issue to the head of the lane, weakened slightly but stayed on for the show
spot. SIR WINSTON was unhurried off of the inside, but lacked a response when called upon. CORE BELIEFS was close up three wide, but stopped before
going a mile and a quarter and was distanced through the stretch.

Footnotes
GOLDEN DRAGON stalked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, made a bid in the stretch, dug in and was driven clear in the final stages.
KAZIRANGA set the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane, pulled clear down the lane but yielded late in the drive. TIZZARUNNER chased the pace
early on, was covered up and in tight along the far turn, raced off the rail into the lane, made a bid late in the stretch and finished willingly. HAY DAKOTA
chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane and finished willingly in the final stages. SILVER N LAI was unprepared at the
start, stalked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. HIGH PROMISE tracked the pace
early, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. MORNING SOCIAL was never a threat. BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL was never a
factor.
