CARIMBA set the pace while off the rail and clear, repelled an inside bid entering the stretch and drew off to prove much the best while being ridden out. ON
BRILLIANT was rated early, made a inside bid entering the stretch but could not go with the winner late while clearly second best. MY MORNING GAL
stalked the pace four wide then was empty while besting the other rival. RED PEPPER GRILL lacked a rally.

BOLD CONCEPT was settled back early, then was three wide by the quarter pole while starting to unwind, was five wide by the three sixteenths pole,
angled out eight wide in mid stretch, closed with authority to draw clear under a drive. SERENA'S HOPE was allowed to settle early, made a nice five wide
bid entering the stretch to loom boldly, but was outfinished by the winner while getting the place award. NIECE JACKIE DAVIS chased the early pace five
wide, made a three wide bid on the turn, but flattened out the final furlong. POLARIZING pressed the early pace on the inside then faded in the final furlong.
JILLS PASSION dueled for the early lead three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn but was empty final three sixteenths. COLONIAL JILL chased the
early pace and weakened. PAIGE'S STAR failed to menace. OLIVE U tracked the early pace then stopped, vanned off.

SPECIAL BEACH was unrushed early, rallied four wide at the eighth pole and was clear late under a strong hand ride. OMI TEN stalked three wide, bid at
the three-eighths pole to be clear in the stretch but was caught late. ANGEL FACE bid belatedly between foes. MISS HATTIE showed her best stride late
outside. IMNOTSMALL stalked in the four path but had no closing bid. IRREVOCABLE TRUST stalked inside before fading in the stretch. MIZZEN THE
COVE stalked the pace between foes, bid at the three-eighths pole, then faltered in the stretch. GRACEFUL CHOICE was clear early, then couldn't last. R
U MIZZEN ME saved ground. GO GERTIE GO was not a factor. CRUZIN COMO stalked in the four path before fading. SO FAVORITA was not a factor.

Footnotes
LADY LEAH set the pace while removed from the rail, shook clear past the eighth pole, then was kept to right handed pressure to prove best. W W FITZY
hopped at the start, then went on to be well placed on the inside, angled out three wide at the top of the stretch for dead aim on the winner but could not
gain on that rival while saving the place. SEEDS OF TIME was allowed to settle early while three wide on the backstretch, came in to the stretch five wide
and offered a mild late rally. JORDAN'S KITTEN was void of early speed, came into the stretch seven wide to offer a belated rally. APPEALING WAY was
reserved early, came into the stretch six wide but had no significant rally. DREAMIN' OF MUNNY was allowed to settle early, swung out six wide for the
stretch run but lacked a rally. SOLAR KITTEN was allowed to settle on the inside then weakened in the stretch. SWEET N WICKED stalked the pace three
wide then tired.
