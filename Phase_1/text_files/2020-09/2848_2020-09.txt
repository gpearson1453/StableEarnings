Footnotes
FANTASTIC SECRET was on the pace outside of PULPIT SINGER to the second turn, edged away to the stretch then drew clear to mid stretch and was all
out to the wire. SWEET CHAYANE got outsprinted early and settled to the half, saved ground to the stretch then finished in a rally. PULPIT SINGER hustled
to contest the pace inside the winner to the second turn, was outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. CHARLIE'S BELLE chased the leaders for six
furlongs three wide but was outfinished in the drive. LIZZY'S INTHEGAME had no speed, settled to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch but lacked
the needed late response. SMOKINHOTREDHEAD had no speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MOMMA MOCCA was unhurried to the second turn, swung out four wide for the drive, rallied but drifted inward, cut off LADY OF THE HOUSE leaving mid
stretch then continued to drift in but prevailed. SERENITY NOW set the pace in hand to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, dug in determinedly to
deep stretch but could not stall the winner. SANDY SUNSHINE pressed SERENITY NOW to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch, loomed
threateningly in mid stretch but finished evenly. EMBODIED had no speed, raced inside MOMMA MOCCA to the second turn, shifted off the rail and was
two wide to the stretch then lacked the needed closing response. LADY OF THE HOUSE stalked the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide to the
stretch then was cut off by MOMMA MOCCA leaving the furlong grounds, steadied and lost any chance. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch
run and disqualified MOMMA MOCCA from first to last for interference to LADY OF THE HOUSE.

contest the pace outside a rival and two wide to the stretch, was overtaken by the winner in mid stretch and weakened. CROSS CREEK tracked the pace to
the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then was outkicked and did not rally. DADDYSPRIZE hustled to duel inside to the stretch then went wrong at the
three sixteenths, was pulled up and vanned off.

HERDSMAN had no speed, settled to the half, circled four wide while rallying on the second turn, pushed to the front in mid stretch and held driving. HOLD
ME CLOSE set the pace off the rail to the second turn, was overtaken in upper stretch then battled BLUES RAPPER through a prolonged stretch run and
got the nod for second. BLUES RAPPER also had no speed, was roused two wide on the second turn, shifted inside of HOLD ME CLOSE in upper stretch
and finished gamely but was nipped for the place. ARC NATION pressed the pace three wide for six furlongs then tired. An incorrect order of finish was
posted and made official placing #2 BLUES RAPPER 2d and #3 HOLD ME CLOSE third. The payoffs for the incorrect finish were: BLUES RAPPER paid
$2.80 to place. The $1.00 exacta 5-2 paid $3.70 and the $0.50 trifecta 5-2-3 paid $2.90.

speed, trailed to the second turn, was three then four wide to the stretch and finished steadily for second. MOON ROCKET set the pace from the rail to the
second turn, was collared but resisted the winner to mid stretch then weakened late. FAMILY TRIPS was outsprinted to the half, raced three wide to the
stretch but went evenly in the drive. EDDIE'S PRINCESS had no speed, settled to the half, was two wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response.
MORNING DOVE tracked the pace for a half mile, tired on the second turn then stopped in the stretch.

UPO had good speed, set a pressured pace for six furlongs, turned back TOP OF THE GAME leaving mid stretch and held stubbornly. TOP OF THE GAME
pressed the winner throughout, rallied to loom boldly in mid stretch but could not get by. UBER STAR stalked the top two from the rail to the stretch,
checked briefly leaving the furlong grounds when lacking room behind the top two then finished willingly. SOBERANO (FR) trailed to the second turn, saved
ground to the stretch and finished in a mild rally. OCEAN FURY chased the leaders to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then came up empty
when roused. SOUTHERN THUNDER had no speed, raced three then two wide to the stretch and did not threaten in the drive. RIDEO was chasing to the
second turn, made a bid three wide to the stretch but weakened in the drive.

CAMINO DEL PARAISO shifted out to get clear on the first turn, stalked the leaders to the half, rallied three wide to the stretch then dug in determinedly to
be along in time. KIWI'S DREAM (AUS) contested the pace from the rail to the stretch, edged away to mid stretch under urging then battled on but was
caught late. NAVY ARMED GUARD was allowed to settle to the second turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch but could not impact the top two.
MAJESTIC EAGLE was rank inside into the first turn, settled on the backstretch then saved ground to the stretch but lacked the needed late response.

(FR) attended the pace outside the winner for six furlongs then was outkicked to mid stretch and tired. IRISH HEATWAVE trailed to the half, was forced to

Footnotes
CHIEF EAGLE EYE had no speed, raced mid pack to the turn, came two wide to the stretch then rallied between rivals and surged to the wire. SHINER'S
CODE was outsprinted to the turn, also was two wide to the stretch then shifted out, responded leaving mid stretch but was bested. BOISTEROUS RASCAL
stalked the pace from the rail to the stretch then finished willingly inside but was outkicked late. NEAH BAY pressed the pace two wide to the stretch,
pushed to the front in mid stretch but was also outfinished. TEXAS BOB broke a bit slow and had no speed, got fanned four wide to the stretch then finished
in a rally. FULL REGALIA trailed to the turn, saved ground to the stretch and finished willingly inside rivals. BOB AGAIN had no speed, swung out to the five
path to the stretch then closed ground belatedly. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET was chasing to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then weakened in the
final furlong. BLUEGRASS WRANGLER hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch but tired in the final furlong. SMILING CREWE tracked
the pace to the turn, made a run three wide to loom a threat into the stretch but gave way in the drive. CHASE CHEETO had no speed and was not a factor.
