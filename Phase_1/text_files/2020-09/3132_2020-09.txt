Footnotes
BECKON prompted the pace outside ZOLA B, moved to apply more pressure leaving the far turn, dueled past the five sixteenths, gained command in upper
stretch, was roused clear leaving the three sixteenths and held firm under a drive. AMPLIO ESQUEMA saved ground, edged up nearing the five sixteenths,
angled out entering the lane and closed steadily. POUNDING MUSIC steadied off heels under the wire the first time, steadied briefly near the three quarter
pole, recovered to stalk, chased outside a rival past the five sixteenths and kept on with effort. ZOLA B took over early and set the pace towards the rail,
took pressure leaving the far turn, dueled as the pace picked up nearing the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then wilted. CONGA IN PARIS , three to four
wide stalking the early pace, dropped in around the final turn and faded. SOMEWHERE GOLDEN , between foes nearing the first turn, eased out and came
under pressure around the far turn and gave way. INVESTER broke a step slow, raced outside a rival past the five eighths and failed to menace. OHH
BEEHAVE saved ground and tired.

SKY PROPOSAL saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch, angled to the two path near the sixteenth pole, closed and was up
late. UNREQUITED LOVE set the pace along the inner rail, opened up in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. MISS MARLEY lacked speed, circled four
wide leaving the turn, advanced to second in mid stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth pole and flattened out. THURSDAY raced in the two path between
horses around the turn and failed to be a factor and gave way. TIZ FERGUSON , three wide on the turn, faltered in the stretch run. PROPER ATTIRE
prompted the pace outside the winner and faltered.

Footnotes
HUSHED HIJINKS , in range towards the inside, eased out under pressure nearing the lane, bid four wide between rivals leaving mid stretch, dueled,
gained a slim lead late and held firm. PRINCE PERE rated three wide early, angled out under asking past the five sixteenths, ranged up five wide outside
rivals in mid stretch, gained a slim lead while attempting to lay in a bit inside the furlong grounds, battled gamely outside the winner but wasn't quite good
enough. BALTIMORE BUD vied outside a rival before clearing past the three eighths, set the pace two wide into the lane, remained clear to mid stretch,
fought on after being collared then faded late. HAIR OF THE DOG had speed inside to contest the pace, eased back leaving the far turn, shifted out in the
drive but needed more. MOSBY'S RANGER , in a bit close at the break, found himself well back with three furlongs to go, came five wide for the drive while
picking up some momentum and closed steadily. DREAMING OF CARATS tracked the pace three wide, moved up to loom a danger entering the lane,
failed to kick on while between rivals in mid stretch and faded. KING SHAWN was checked soon after the break, steadied between runners in the opening
furlong, angled six wide but came up empty. CRYING FOR MORE broke a step slow, raced wide and failed to menace. MIRACLE BOBBIE broke outward
brushing a rival, dropped to the rail soon after and faltered.

willingly. SIMMARD SHENANIGAN , four wide the first turn, remained off the rail to the stretch, angled to the inner rail in mid stretch and passed tired
horses. ORTINOLA , forwardly placed down the backstretch, raced in the two path on the far turn and gave way in the drive. ARBUTUS sprinted clear mid

SAN ANTONE , quickly to the front, set a rated pace about two wide while handling outside pressure, opened up after being asked in upper stretch then
continued to widened while under a solid hand ride the final furlong. WICKED PRANKSTER was sent to contention, pressed the pace three wide outside the
winner, saw that one get away soon into the lane, wandered inward pursuing past the sixteenth pole then stayed well to salvage the place. TWICE AS
SMART settled off the pace about two wide, shifted out near mid stretch and had belated action. SAM IN STYLE , four wide pursuing the winner, was under
pressure into the lane and went evenly late. DREAMPOINT , off the pace, circled four wide into the lane, drifted in briefly, was corrected and gave effort to
the line. HELMS DEEP pulled his way forward along the rail nearing the, rated close then crept up to have aim past the five sixteenths, began to fade in mid
stretch, drifted out late and steadied off the heels of WICKED PRANKSTER. PEPE AND HEYWOOD broke a step slow, saved ground off the pace and
failed to menace. BANANAS ON FIRE had speed between runners, steadied nearing the turn, shifted in and gave way. An objection by the rider of HELMS
DEEP against WICKED PRANKSTER for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed

Footnotes
THE CAIRO KID bumped with STONE COURAGEOUS soon after the break, hugged the inner rail, took the lead on the turn, opened up approaching the
stretch and was under urging in the drive. ABSOLVED chased the early pace, was taken to the inner rail leaving the far turn, remained along the rail and
rallied mildly. KARAN'S NOTION showed speed well off the rail, failed to keep pace with the winner around the turn and flattened out in the stretch run.
MARKET ANALYSIS lacked speed, swung to the five path turning for home, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. STONE COURAGEOUS bumped
with the winner soon after the break, raced along the inner rail most of the trip and was not a factor. SEVEN ON THE ROCKS , four deep on the turn, was
not a factor. ROYAL THUNDER , rated down the backstretch, was four deep approaching the turn, negotiated the turn in the three path and weakened.

Footnotes
JAXON TRAVELER broke sharply, set a rated pace two wide while handling some early pressure from both sides, edged clear into the turn, remained under
rating to about the quarter pole, opened up readily after being roused soon into the lane, was flashed the whip a few times and powered away while kept to
steady hand encouragement. LUGAMO had speed three wide outside the winner, stalked around the turn, came under pressure into the lane and just got
the place following extended battle with SPEIGHTSTER RED. SPEIGHTSTER RED had speed inside rivals, steadied briefly nearing the turn, came back
along the rail to take aim near the quarter pole, could not impact the winner from the three sixteenths but dug in gamely through the drive and missed the
bob for second. RAPID RESPONSE , reluctant to load, came away in decent fashion and rated in range behind rivals, angled out near mid stretch and
churned on with interest. SOME MO saved ground and lacked a bid. KING ALAN leaned in at the break, chased in the clear and faded. IRON PEARLS , off
slowly after drifting in towards the gap, was taken off the inside early on, circled five wide but lacked a bid. INDEFATIGABLE showed speed four wide
outside rivals, remained in range to the quarter pole then gave way. MACHO SMOKE , off slowly, dropped far back, came three to four wide but failed to
make an impact. LAMARKABLE , away slowly, found himself well back after a furlong, saved ground into the lane but failed to respond.

PATRIOTIC PUNCH drifted out at the break, settled well back, saved ground into the lane, swung out to be four to five wide in upper stretch, leveled off
under right handed rousing, rallied between foes and just got up. POSITIVE FORCE prompted the pace two to three wide, was under a drive into the lane,
kept on gamely and earned the place between rivals. SHE'S A BLACK BELT drifted out at the break, corrected and edged up to stalk three to four wide,
churned on between foes and got the show. LOOKIN FOR CANDY bobbled at the break, sped clear early, set the pace two wide into the lane, remained
clear under a drive past the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly. ROCKSTAR GIRL broke a step slow, saved ground early, angled out around the
turn, circled five wide into the lane, brushed with a rival and rallied. RAN CHAR tracked inside and came up empty. ELOQUENT LADY chased outside a
rival, exchanged a brush in upper stretch and faded.
