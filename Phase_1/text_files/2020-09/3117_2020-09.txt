Footnotes
BROOKLYN LAW tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide into the lane, then made a steady gain and drove clear late.
MYHESSEXPRESS set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid into the stretch, dueled with DRUNKEN LOVE in the lane, held swap over that one while
not match for the winner late. DRUNKEN LOVE stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, dueled, then was no match and held
the show. CHARLITA mid pack, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong. SEA
MONSTER angled in early, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. HEATHER'S GOLD
well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and flattened out. MONTRICHARD mid pack, moved up
three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and had no rally. APPROVED TO WIN improved position. WHOOPS had a wide trip. CAPTAIN FUN

HONEY BOURBON mid pack, moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up late.
DOMINANT STRANGER mid pack, moved up while angling out through the second turn, came widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the
needed late kick. BALLYBRACK LASS allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, then evened
out while gaining the show. CASCABELL QUEEN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the final furlong, then weakened and held a
share. GYPSY WIND allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid five wide into the lane and had a mild gain. ART FORM
tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path through the turns, bid three wide into the lane and weakened. LOVELY ARABELLA passed tiring rivals.
ACT LIKE A LADY stalked the pace in the early going, dropped back slightly and saved ground through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into
the stretch and weakened. KATIE'S SUNRISE improved position. PURE MAGIC never far back, gained position three and four wide through the second
turn, bid four wide into the lane and faded. SEA CANDY well placed and outside, held position three wide through the second turn, then had no rally.
