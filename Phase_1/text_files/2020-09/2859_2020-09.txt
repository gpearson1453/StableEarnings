Footnotes
HAPPY WANDERER rated close up and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, drove
clear and held. ORCHESTRAL rated outside the leader, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside, then was no match for the
winner and held the place safe. CONQUEST GIROBALL never far back, looped to a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into
the lane and flattened out. TIGER PAW mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside and ran evenly in the lane. STARLING'S LAW set
the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong. C THE KING allowed to settle, looped up three and four
wide through the turn, bid five wide into the lane and weakened in the drive. BEING THERE showed little. REPLAY was no factor. PROMETHEAN was
never involved.

ENTHRONED mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and closed well for the show. BLAZE OF JOY allowed
to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and got up for a share. DISCRIMANATION set the early pace on the
inside, stayed on when challenged into the turn, then faded the finalfurlong. ORBITAL DEITY ran evenly. LITTLEMISSTATERTOT well placed and outside,
held position four wide through the turn, then had no rally. PALACES DIAMOND was no factor.
