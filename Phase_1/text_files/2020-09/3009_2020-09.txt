IBELIEVEINMIRACLES bumped at the start, prompted the pace two wide, matched strides through the final furlong and proved best under strong handling.
LAISSEZ FAIRE made the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside, dug in when joined by the winner but finished second best.
UCANTKEEPUP never far back, closed a gap late in the six path. SEEKING A JEWEL trailed into the turn, swung wide and closed some ground in the eight
path late. SHACK'S HAREM bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide into the turn and was through after half. SHOW ME SOME SASS was no
factor. ANSWER QUIETLY was bounced around between horses at the start, squeezed then had brief speed.

TIME TO SHOOT sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace along the inside and finished full of run to win going away. GUCCISSIMO raced
widest throughout and rallied determinedly through deep stretch in the middle of the racetrack to be clear for second. ATTUCK stalked the pace five wide
and finished with good courage. MINE'S DIALED IN near the inside, was on heels from the seven sixteenths pole til midway on the turn, bid into the stretch
along the rail then failed to sustain that bid. UYEDA chased the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened. IMA BELIEVER was no factor. IRIE ISLAND
MAN was outrun. SHARKS COVE vied for the early lead three wide and was through after a half. WATCH YOUR STEP chased the winner two wide into the
turn then flattened out. WYATTS WARRIOR was never close, pulled up entering the stretch and was walked off.

SHESDIAMONITE bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide into the turn, made the lead past the quarter pole then widened the balance of the trip to
win in hand. HOPES AND PRAYERS veered in shortly after the start causing a chain reaction of bumping to her inside, dropped to the rail, dueled for the
lead along the inside for a half then was no match for the winner. EMPIRITA was bumped and squeezed at the start, moved up in the four path entering the
stretch then leveled off. HALIE'S ARCH also bumped and squeezed at the start, was forced inward then failed to menace. LA MUNECA dueled for the lead
two wide and was through early. STEEL CITY BRIEZE was bounced around between horses at the start, pinched a few strides thereafter, clipped heels, fell
suffering a catastrophic injury and was euthanized. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED HOPES AND
PRAYERS AND PLACED HER FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE START.

again late in the six path and got up for second. ROLLIN ALL THE WAY bumped repeatedly the length of the chute, battled for the lead two wide then inside
for a half and was outfinished. H. F. CARMEL trailed down the backstretch, moved up in the four path on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. CANDY

Footnotes
KITTY EXPRESS well placed, rallied three wide on the far turn, drifted to mid track entering the stretch, made the lead a furlong out and won as much the
best under a hand ride. GRADY'S LADY split leaving the clubhouse turn, made the lead and quickly drew clear after a quarter, set the pace to the top of the
stretch, dug in gamely when headed and finished second best. TRUEAMERICANBEAUTY stalked the pace two wide for six furlongs, made the lead, set the
pace until mid stretch then was outfinished. SWEETALKINGJUSTICE failed to menace. PRETTY PRODUCTION passed tiring rivals. IT'S SPRINGTIME set
the early pace off the rail in the three path, chased the pace into the far turn, remained a sharp threat along the inside until mid stretch then gave way.
GOLFIN' DE AN had brief speed. QUEENA ESTHER showed little. WICKED LOVE chased the early pace and was through after a half.
