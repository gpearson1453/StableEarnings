held. ROANIE was content to lag following a slow break then closed outside through the lane. LUNAR PRIZE settled between foes, circled into the stretch,
lugged in late and bumped with the winner. AFLEET TRAXX was slow early then made a late run between horses. MIDNIGHT HAULER saved ground into
the stretch then angled out between horses with a late run. GRAB THE GOLD took command at once, made the pace in the two path for over five furlongs
then faded from between horses. INHONOROFTHEMOON was close up along the rail into the turn, fell back, regained ground in early stretch then flattened
out. FLASHINTHENIGHT advanced between horses before a quarter, remained prominent in the three path into the final furlong then tired. SENSE OF
JUSTICE made an early run between horses, stopped then was vanned off following the race. START CASHIN made a four wide run inside the winner
around the turn then stopped and was eased up through the lane.
