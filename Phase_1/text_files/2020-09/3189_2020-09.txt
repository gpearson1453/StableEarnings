Footnotes
BLONDILIKESTODANCE was in mid pack, gained ground on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch drew clear. ONE FOR NICKI was
unhurried early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. SHAMRUCKUS set the pace and
had the lead on the turn but was headed in mid stretch and held show. SHEZTENTHEHARDWAY was in touch and roused on the turn but needed more.
CLASSY VISION settled off the pace and moved up on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch leveled off. HUSH BUFFY stalked the early
leader but chased on the turn and from the three path a the top of the stretch had nothing left. CELTIC SINGER was off slow and showed little while outrun.
HANSEN'S GIRL broke poorly, lost ground on the turn, pulled up in mid stretch and walked off.

outdistanced and walked off. MAX'S LAST was up close early, lost ground on the far turn, was outdistanced and walked off.

IT'SNICETOBENICE tracked the leaders from the outside, was a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best.
BENADETTE'S LADY was in touch, in tight on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for place. REBEL LIONESS stalked the
early leader, dueled from between foes on the far turn and vied through the stretch but was outfinished. SECRETARIATS HONOR was in range and roused
on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. ROMANTIC BLISS was off slow and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. GYPSY JAZZ was hustled early but headed on the far turn and gave way. DELLY was off the pace
and saved ground on the far turn but was not a factor. KATE'S WHISTLE had no speed and was hustled along on the far turn but failed to fire. TAYLER'S
THE BOSS was in mid pack but chased on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no impact.

Footnotes
MIJO showed speed from the inside, had the lead on the turn and with a clear lead through the stretch was much the best. BEAR CUB was in touch, moved
up on the turn and from the three path through the stretch was second best. UP N ADAM was unhurried early, hustled along on the turn and from the five
path through the stretch was up for show. SUNKA WAKAN was hustled early and a factor on the turn but weakened through the stretch. DOODLE DANDY
was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. J M R SILENT LAKE was up close and raced
evenly on the turn but came up empty. WHATSONEMORE was in range early but lost ground on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
BEEN WAITING was in mid pack, moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. LEO THE RABBIT stalked
the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and had the lead at the top of the stretch but was outgunned. DIVINE AMI was unhurried early and had a mild
gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. HONDURAS showed speed from the inside and dueled on the turn but was all
out through the stretch. BRONZE AGE forced the early pace and had a slim lead on the turn but dropped back through the stretch. R DANCE HALL was off
the pace, showed little and was never in contention.

THE KIPPY TRAIN showed speed and set the pace, took command on the turn and was kept to task through the stretch. GET THE NEWS was off slow and
moved up on the turn but was no match for the winner. POOL PLAYA was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the
stretch was no real threat. STROLLING POSSE was off the pace, hustled along on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for a
share. STOPVICTIMIZINGME was in touch and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. HARDY CANDY had no speed and was roused on the turn
but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no response. EYES FORWARD was well back and showed little in a dull effort. UKNOWULIKEIT stalked
the early leader but chased on the turn and came up empty.

KILKENNY PROSPECT stalked the early leaders, was a factor on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. GIANTBALLS OF
FIRE was unhurried early and moved up on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was second best. A VIKING MORNING was in range
and raced evenly on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. HARMONY HALL was off the pace and gained ground on the
far turn but leveled off through the stretch. DOCTOR ROBERT set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the far turn but had nothing left. BADDEST
BLUES was well back, saved ground on the far turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. THOR'S THUNDER forced the early pace and dueled from
between foes on the far turn but was all out through the stretch. KEEP GOING was in mid pack and roused on the far turn but had no response.
EBORACUM was in touch but lost ground on the far turn and was empty. ALEXANDER THE GRAY showed no speed, trailed the field on the far turn and
had no impact.
