BOURBON NATIVE raced well off of the pace, rolled past horses on the turn, was wide in the stretch and fought the leading horse before clearing in deep
stretch. DONTNEEDANAME prompted the pace from outside a foe, led on the turn, gamely battled the winner down the stretch and yielded late. LOVER
BOY was huslted to the lead inside, lost the lead on the turn and held show down the stretch. GOLDEN NOTION bumped a foe at the start, chased the pace
early and through the turn and faltered from inside down the stretch. DARBY DART was off the pace, took the four path on the turn, came wide in the stretch
and improved position late. GREENSPAN bumped a horse at the start, was up close to the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
CHRISTIANS CITY veered in at the start, sat behind the early leader, headed that one at the quarter pole and vied, getting the lead late under hand urging.
OUR FLAG led to the stretch, vied with the winner down the lane, was game but yielded late. SPEED GRACER was off the pace to the stretch, angled out
for room in upper stretch and chased, then closed for show. BORA BORA steadily advanced inside to have the show spot but lost that position in the final
furlong. ANIMATE was shuffled back inside on the first turn, checked on the backstretch and ran on to improve position in the stretch. COURT AND SPARK
was shut off at the start, widest on the backstretch and ran evenly from the far turn. EL CHEAPO was up close until late stretch and faltered. CHUCKLES
CANDY took the five path on the first turn, was wide on the backstretch while getting closer but weakened on the far turn. SMUGGLER'S GHOST tracked
from inside, lacked a rally on the turn and drifted out in the stretch.

Footnotes
JETTIN PEGASUS had a terrible start but quickly regrouped and taken outside for clear run on the backstretch to turn, circled the field and ran on with good
courage to run down the leader with an all out ride to the wire. IBELIEVEINMIRACLES dueled from inside to quarter pole, edged off a bit into the stretch run,
looked good in the final sixteenth put was run down in the final strides. HYDRA'S HOPE reserved to the turn, raced evenly from inside through the drive.
GRADUATEWITHHONORS sharp speed outside ran in tandem to turn, slowly gave way late. HEAVENLY MINE broke tardy, far back to the stretch,
improved position only. OHIO SILVER tardy start, rushed outside to turn, used up, backed up. HIGHLY VISIBLE had a steady fade from inside.

Footnotes
SOUR PEACH never far back with an outside trip, split horses while well handled and held to the wire in a good effort. YIELD never far back between
horses with tons of trouble turn into the far turn and stretch while probably best best today. MOMENTA KAT settled back of pack to far turn, came five wide
in stretch for the show spot. NARROWS BRIDGE behind pace to far turn, checked back at five sixteenths pole, recovered well and moved up. GO
STELLAIRE raced evenly from inside with out any gain in the stretch run. PLEASE DO four wide to first turn with a bobble going into the backstretch with no
response when needed. ARIAN RAE broke through gate pre start, up close with a three wide run to quarter pole but could not sustain the bid and faded in
the lane. HERO OF THE BEST good speed to quarter pole, used up and backed up in the stretch. QUEEN MAXINE no speed to the half and went around
trouble around the far turn to improve position only. BUTTER UP KATIE back to the turn, steadied back past five sixteenths pole with nothing left. TRACK
MAGIC was through early and stopped. SPOOFY DOO three wide speed first turn, led at the half, but swarmed from both sides on the far turn and ran on
empty through the stretch run.

Footnotes
PRESI PLAIN JANE readily passed foes on the turn, led clear, was headed in upper stretch and battled to deep stretch, getting clear nearing the finish.
TETON THAI made a quick move inside on the turn, headed the leader in upper stretch, dueled to deep stretch and only yielded late. DULCE MARIA was
near the pace early, ran on for show and was best of the rest. FIVE O'CLOCK was away a step slow, raced wide early and ran evenly. ENGLISH TOFFE
ROSE was well back, mild in the stretch and improved position. SPRINGDALE pressed the leader into the turn and tired. ROSY MAY led betrween foes
early but galloped past the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
HE'S THE SOUPERWON went to the lead inside, was headed on the turn, responded and stayed clear down the lane despite floating out wide. NEW
YEAR'S LUCK was off slow, steadily advanced, headed the winner on the turn, was rebuffed but gave chase while being floated out wide. AGAINST THE
LINE angled inside on the backstretch, tracked up close to the turn, lacked a rally and ran evenly in the stretch while managing to improve position. IT'S
GAME TIME tracked from mid pack and ran evenly in the lane. OLA QUE TAL was bumped at the start, raced last while inside early and ran eratically in the
stretch. CHEAP SHOT raced close to the front, was urged inside on the far turn, loomed a threat in upper stretch but bore in and lost position in late stretch.
STACK EM HIGH was off the pace and stalled on the far turn. E Z MAN BAND was bumped at the start and involved for a quarter.
