Footnotes
WILADENE was well rated early and made a three wide bid past the half mile pole to assume command, then repulsed bid entering the stretch and drew
clear in the final furlong to prove much under a drive. SALTED REVENGE was rated early on the inside, moved out two wide past the three eighths pole to
launch a bid, then tried the winner entering the stretch while on the inside, but could not go with that rival while clearly second best. READY TO MONBA
was allowed to settle early, made a three wide middle move to move into contention three wide past the five sixteenths pole, but was empty in the stretch
while besting the rest. QUEEN CHARMAINE was sent to the front to set the pace on the inside then gave way after a half mile. DERBY PRINCESS was not
a threat. CANDY EMPIRE had a four wide then stopped.

OFF SIXES stalked in the four path, rallied six wide at the quarter pole and was up in time under steady urging. ELZABE'S ON BOARD led inside of a foe in
the three path but couldn't hold off the winner. OLD TIMER'S DAY pressed outside of the leader but had no closing bid. WILL KNOWS stalked in the four
path but had no closing bid. ROCK ME bid four wide at the eighth pole but then faltered in the drive. GETTIN EVEN stalked in the four path before fading.
IMPUNITY saved ground to no avail. FOREVER THE CHIEF was not a factor.

pace on the backstretch, eased out four wide past the quarter pole, then was up for the show. OUR NEIGHBOR BOYS had no rally while being outfinished
for the show award. HE'S A WARRIOR vied for the lead early, made a bid on the backstretch to draw clear, then was headed entering the stretch, came out

Footnotes
COACH stalked the early pace five wide, made a four wide move on the turn, took command past the quarter pole, then drew off smartly in the stretch to
prove much the best under a drive. COREY was well placed early from the inside, was boxed and was awaiting room by the five sixteenths pole, swung out
five wide leaving the quarter pole for racing room, finished well for the place while no match for the winner while second best. LETTERED OLIVE dueled for
the early lead two wide, then found herself in between rivals past the five sixteenths pole, faded in the stretch while saving the show award. HUNGARIAN
PRINCESS was allowed to settle early on the inside, swung out four wide past the quarter pole, but offered no significant rally while gaining the minor
rewards. NEW BOSS dueled for the early lead on the inside then weakened. SCAT'S CHOICE was outrun early then lacked a rally. TRIP TO SEOUL
steadied early while four wide then tired.

Footnotes
TIMELESS ROSE was reserved early, made a strong five wide move on the far turn, assumed command at the top of the stretch, drew clear to prove best
under a drive. BANKRUPTONTHEBEACH was bumped at the start, settled back early, moved five wide past the quarter pole to move into contention, then
had a good finish but could not get to the winner. LIRAZ was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the far turn, lugged in by the eighth pole, but
flattened out. SPUN EAZY was void of early speed on the inside, then swung out seven wide for drive to have a belated rally. TOMORRA chased the pace
from the inside, was boxed on the far turn, swung out three wide into the stretch, but lacked the needed stretch bid while having traffic past the eighth pole.
NOT A PROBLEM was allowed to settle on the inside but lacked the needed rally. ENGLISH ESCORT tracked the early pace and made a four wide bid to
press the pace on the backstretch then vied for the lead on the far turn before tiring in the drive. GINSENG pressed the pace three wide then gave way.
NOTHINGBUTFLOWERS set a pressed pace on the inside before giving way. SPARTANKA dull effort.
