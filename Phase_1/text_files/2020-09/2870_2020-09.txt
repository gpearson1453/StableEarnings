Footnotes
WINK TEXAS dueled from the outside early, battled through the turn, shook loose entering the drive, gained a clear margin and was well clear while under
steady urging. TIME FOR A SONG dueled from between foes early, remained engaged with the winner through the turn but could not match strides in the
drive. ARKANSAS BLING stalked the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced through the turn, altered outside for the drive and closed with a rush for
the show. DANCE ON OVER chased the early pace from the outside, advanced through the turn, responded but was too late. DIAMOND LILY dueled from
the inside but came up empty in the drive. FOXYCALL went evenly. BLUE XCHANGE forced the early pace outside and tired. VEILS AND VOWS was no
factor. FANCY GI GI vied from the inside early and tired. SUSAN STRONG was no threat. A SONG FOR MICKEY chased the early pace and faded.
LARISSA was never close.

SMARTY GRIMES up close early from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, responded along the rail and drew clear late. GOOSE chased the early
pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded when asked and closed with a rush for the place. FLEET RUN stalked the early pace
from the outside, advanced through the turn, responded and was just up for the show. CRAFTY IKE outrun early, advanced outside through the turn,
responded and finished well but too late. TIZ NEYNEY AND RAD dueled from between foes but had nothing left. KATAMA BAY dueled from the outside and
tired. BRUTALIZE went evenly. HAMAZING SONG dueled from the inside and tired. WHY NOT CHARLIE was no factor. MARTIN G was no menace.
PRIORITY'S LIL BOY showed little.

Footnotes
MADELYN'S WILD MAX stalked the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, altered outside, responded to pressure to gain the margin
and was well clear while kept to task. KING BANDIT stalked the early pace from the outside, inched closer entering the turn, responded but could not reach
the winner. GUILTY AGAIN forced the early pace from the outside, remained forward for the drive but could not keep pace. CONFEDERATE YELL up close
early from the inside, remained forward for the drive but had nothing left. STEPPIN' OUTONHER pressed the early pace outside but could only improve
position. CASE'S TICKET could only pass tired ones. ROLLWITHIT was no factor. PHAT AND FAST was no threat. HITTER broke sharp from between foes
to gain a clear early margin, remained forward then faded in the drive. MY RAINEY DAY was no menace. THEBOYZHOUR was finished early.
