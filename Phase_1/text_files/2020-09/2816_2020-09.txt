early, edged clear leaving the turn and was reeled in late. KELLEN CASH settled well, moved four wide into the stretch and stayed on. TEQUILA ducked in
at the start, was outpaced early and showed some late interest. READY OR NOT forced the pace and weakened. RUTHLESS RHETT was always outrun.

on to good effect. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY void of speed, commenced his bid on the far turn, was swung five wide and kept on belatedly.

GIRLS IN CHARGE chased while three wide, moved closer on the turn, was swung four wide and rallied. MY GOLDEN DAY chased the pacesetter, surged
clear in the stretch and was run down late. STUNNING ONE settled while four wide, advanced on the turn and finished well in the stretch. VELVA'S
LEGACY sprinted clear, held well into the stretch and gave way. TIZALADYBUG never menaced. INTOXICATING KISS showed little. HOLIDAY ROMANCE
raced forwardly along the inside and faded.

was no match late. AQUINA'S ADVICE saved ground, was angled off the rail in the stretch and kept on. VEGAS VIXEN was brushed at the start and
exhibited mild late interest. MISS TYRO chased the pacesetter and weakened. ANIMATOR was squeezed back at the start and never involved. LUCKY
ROAD veered in at the start and was outrun. FASHION FACT retreated.
