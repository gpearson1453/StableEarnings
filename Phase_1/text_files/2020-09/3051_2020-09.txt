Footnotes
GAMBLING CAT away the tardiest after stutter-stepping her way out of the starting gate, got set up along the inside route, flashed interest crossing the
midway point of the fuller turn, maintained that momentum cutting the corner under a brisk hand ride, narrowed in, was able to tip towards path three
imidstretch, requiring strong pressure on the right side however, lugged in coming up to the sixteenth and then soon afterwards going by it, got corrected
only with the application of a snug grip once again on the right side, kicked into her best, boldly splitting rivals in the final seventy yards then out-fought them
for the score. CADENCIA sighted three wide on each of the bends, drafted in the two path travelling on the backstretch, got cued up for the drive home,
rallied with good energy to emerge at the eighth pole as the new leader, came under heavy pressure from a pair of opponents in deep stretch, got nailed.
EVVIE JETS one of the quickest out of the gate, dropped back during the initial stages while proceeding along somewhat keenly, departed the backstretch
from the two path, angled five wide for racing room upper to midstretch, had a good finish down the center of the course to be along for the show. UPTOWN
FLIRT bobbling lightly losing her footing springing from the gate, raced two to three wide heading for the top of the backstretch, was more the former
stepping onto the turn, got moved out into path four for the stretch run, lacked a solid closing punch. MOMENTITA settled into the two path after the field
had been sent off and running, prompted the pace unkind for a good portion of the opening half as indicated by her pulling quite a bit on the bit, went about
more professionally closing the gap on the fuller turn, was directly abreast of TAQSEEMAAT as they spun into the lane, issued her best challenge during the
ensuing furlong, couldn't cement itself to the top and backed away. LILLY SIMONE saved ground for three-quarters, was under a ride gradually being
worked into path three from upper to midstretch, lacked the needed response. TAQSEEMAAT was rank disputing the pace from along the inside, for much
of the trip leading to the end of the backstretch, got put to the test by MOMENTITA as six furlongs was being rattled off, succumbed. WE MISS HARVEY
sluggish on the chute, went over to the rail, brought up the back of the pack one-paced, stepped into the lane and ventured down it ridden out.

Footnotes
HARRIS BAY bumped at the start by RIKEN who broke in under coaxing, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to get up in the final strides and prevail on the wire. RIKEN broke in under coaxing at the start bumping
lightly with HARRIS BAY, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch, got roused
nearing the eighth pole clear to that station, dug in under growing late threat and was caught in the final jumps. INSIDE INFO coaxed from the gate, chased
along the inside in closest aim of the leader down the backstretch, tipped to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. WARDENOFTHENORTH chased three to four wide put to coaxing three furlongs from
home, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. MICROSCOPE chased two to three wide under a ride from the
three-eighths, cornered two to three wide for home, offered no response. BIG THICKET chased along the inside under coaxing from midway on the turn,
spun just off the inside for home and weakened.

Footnotes
SECOND OF JULY made light contact with FIGHTING FORCE in the shadow of the starting gate, assumed a forward position, stalked the pacesetter from
path two, picked it up and closed the gap during the final stages of the run around the bend, came under a ride challenging as the middle member of a trio of
front runners slugging it out for the advantage heading home, fought onward with good courage so as to be begin the last eighth leading by a little, dug in
well in during the final sixteenth to fend off the second place finisher. FIGHTING FORCE caught leaning to the outside as the field was sent off the running,
brushed into the right side of the gate, then shouldered the winner right afterwards, settled into stride and secured a prominent spot, sat forwardly placed
three wide on the turn, moved up to increase his presence as the half was being posted, put in a strong bid as the outermost of three from the head of the
stretch to the sixteenth pole, went at it one on with SECOND OF JULY afterwards, couldn't go by. REALM OF LAW took up the chase from the two path in
midpack, commenced the stretch slightly wider, mustered up a mild response for the show. VOTER PROTECTION saved ground for nearly a half, was
worked into path six during the first half of the stretch run, made no headway late. CHASING FAME a bit keen pursuing the pace early on the backstretch,
accelerated to the top when given some rein as the first fraction was being finalized, cut over to the inside, eventually settling along the outer border of the
inside route, came under intensified pressure from the top twosome approaching the quarter pole, got set down, relinquished making her way through the
furlong grounds, vied for another sixteenth before weakening. TEXAS BASIN over-reacted shying away from another at the start, was three wide entering
the turn and fanned out five wide exiting it, flattened out. EXPLAIN firmly rated tracking the front runners from along the rail, tipped into the two path at the
top of the lane, gave way. KENTUCKY KNIGHT cut over to the rail, faltered off the ground-saving journey that followed.

Footnotes
FAMILY BIZ four to five wide in pursuit down the backstretch, chased four wide through the turn coming under coaxing advancing nearing the quarter pole,
took over command at that station, swung five then four wide straightened away into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to the finish. MALIBU PRO
chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into
upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while along well clear of the rest and second best. THE SICARII five paths off the inside down the
backstretch in aim of the front, tucked three wide into the turn and advanced in tandem with SUPER DUDE on the leader midway on the turn, took over
narrow command just inside that station and shook away from the former leading pair coming under threat from the eventual winner to the outside, got
headed at the quarter pole and spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive, weakened to the finish while clear for the show honors. SUPER DUDE broke
out at the start bumping ALLURED and pinching that foe back in tandem with AMERICAN LINCOLN, raced three to four wide in closest aim of the leader,
advanced in tandem with the aforementioned foe and pressed the pace just off the inside through the turn between foes taking brief and narrow command
near the three-eighths before being headed by THE SICARII, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and tired.
ALLURED got bumped between foes who each broke his way and was pinched back at the start conceding about three lengths to the front, chased six
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths and saved ground through the turn getting placed to coaxing three furlongs
from home, angled out six wide into upper stretch and tired. CHIEF KNOW IT ALL coaxed from the start, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and faltered, then got pulled up quickly after the finish. AMERICAN LINCOLN broke in at the start
bumping and pinching back ALLURED in concert with SUPER DUDE, established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside at
the nine-sixteenths and came under pressure from a pair to the outside, got put to urging near the three-eighths, yielded the front at that station, faded and
cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, folded, then got pulled up quickly after the finish.

Footnotes
TWO CENT TOOTSIE cemented itself to a forward position after the start, was patiently ridden accompanying ROSEY'S INVASION, moved when ready as
three-quarters was being completed, settled onto the head of the stretch and was given its cue, wasted no time taking charge, began the final furlong with
LUCKY LATKES bearing down hard, held on with good determination to preserve the decision. LUCKY LATKES tracked the front runners from the pocket,
got ridden three wide into the lane, took off in earnest after the ones to catch, finished with willingness down the center of the course but got staved off. SHE
SO NAUGHTY bobbled lightly losing her footing at the start, angled sharply over to the inside, arriving on the rail by the top of the backstretch, stayed put
keeping watch on the pace, was asked to pick it up maneuvering towards path three at the midway point of the fuller turn, was asked to pick it even further
for the stretch run, shifted wider and wider racing down the lane, until in the neighborhood of path seven, flashed late foot getting up for the show.
RUNNING ON ENTRY made it over to the rail by the end of the backstretch, kept an eye on the pace from midpack, stepped into the stretch, angled into
path four heading for the eighth pole, stayed on for the last major check. ROSEY'S INVASION launched herself to the front end with a three wide run on the
chute, tucked along the rail once sufficiently in the clear early on the backstretch, showed the way, mildly hand urged and facing pressure from the winner
out in the two path, got roused as that one inched up at the quarter pole, yielded soon afterwards then backed away. TORNADO CROSSING strung out
three wide on the chute, was unhurried taking path two on the subsequent bend, got ridden four wide into the lane, made no impact. LITTLE RED BUTTON
gathered after coming out with its initial step, sat three wide on each bend, shifted into path five from uipper to midlane, had no closing punch. CENTRAL
CAPITAL took up the chase from between path two and the inside route for most of the opening six furlongs, went into the stretch, wandered all the way to
the eight path making no headway. SANDRA'S MINE four wide heading for the backstretch, departed it from path three, never made its presence felt.
COURTED forwardly placed three, was sighted pulling during the opening phases, finished off six furlongs and gave out. EIGHTY SEVEN NORTH strung
out four wide on the chute, travelled towards path two on the turn, got moved inward in time to cut the corner into the lane, had no rally. SOPHIE FATALE
saved ground on each bend, was never in it.

SHANES PRETTY LADY got brushed at the start by TAMI'S ORCHID just after that rival was bumped by the inward breaking FLIRTACIOUS KISS while
under coaxing from the gate, chased two to three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive rallying to take command just inside the eighth pole, shied in slightly under an off sided stick while edging away to the finish kept busy
to the wire. VIOLENTIAM prompted the leader from the outside in the five path down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn, came under
light coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, dug in taking command near the eighth pole, got displaced
inside that station and ran on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. BLAME IT ON MARY six paths off the inside down the backstretch in close aim of
the top pair, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
prominent to the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages while safe for the show honors. A BIT O'IRISH SASS five to six paths off the inside down the
backstretch in pursuit from mid pack, tucked three wide through the turn, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide for home, ran on
through to the finish improving position for the last major share. LA URBANA established the front and showed the way four then three wide down the
backstretch under light coaxing and facing pressure from VIOLENTIAM to the outside, tucked to the two path through the turn and knocked heads from the
midway point on the bend, swung three wide for home, dug in under threat and relented near the eighth pole, then weakened through to the finish.
PHOTOFINISH JEANNE five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside into the turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and weakened. CAPTIVATING CARA brushed the near side stall at the start, chased along the inside under a ride from three
furlongs out, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. WISH FOR MAGIC brushed the off side stall at the start, chased seven
paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into
upper stretch and tired. STAY HOME MAMA a bit unsettled in the gate prior to the start, got coaxed away from the gate at the break, chased five wide under
coaxing from midway on the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. VIVE LA LIBERTY hustled from the gate, chased four wide down the
backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.
TAMI'S ORCHID got bumped at the start by FLIRTACIOUS KISS and in turn brushed SHANES PRETTY LADY, chased just off the inside until tucked inside
at the nine-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and was unable to make an impact. FLIRTACIOUS KISS broke in at the start bumping TAMI'S
ORCHID into SHANES PRETTY LADY, chased four wide under a ride from three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and made no
impact.

Footnotes
JASMINESQUE well rated off the inside on the backstretch, got moved into the four path at the top of the turn, improved position during the run around the
bend, got moved out one path farther off the rail for the stretch run, chopped away readily at the deficit during the ensuing furlong, forged on ahead
relentlessly, getting up in the shadow of the wire. TRANSLATE took up the chase from the two path on the turn, got called upon as the half was being
completed, was sent out into the four path, closed in, found herself battling between rivals in the final stages, bravely won the place. ZACCAPA (FR) settled
into midpack after the start, travelled about the turn towards path two, got steered in the direction of the rail to upper stretch, had the rider take hold and then
get re-routed to the outside just inside the eighth pole, wedged itself between rivals in deep stretch after rallying into contention, grabbed the show award.
APURATE stalked the pace from path two, increased her presence as the half was being completed, put in a strong bid all the way down the lane, came up
short. YES TO MISCHIEF guided over to the rail after establishing control in short order, set the splits, with APURATE in attendance from the outside, got
put to the test stepping onto the head of the stretch, offered good resistance before getting overwhelmed in deep stretch. BASTET along the outside
throughout, stepped onto the turn from the four path, advanced to within striking distance as the second split was about to be posted, swung into the lane
under a drive and took off in earnest after the front runners, vied onward with willingness until a little past the eighth pole, was in the process of losing some
position bit by bit when pinched with about a sixteenth to go, fell back farther having never recovered any real interest. FLY FIGHT WIN took the inside
route, went into the two path in upper stretch, lacked the needed response. ALL AMERICAN DREAM sent over to the rail nearing the conclusion of the
backstretch, chased the pace towards the rear, got sent out five wide entering upper stretch, made no impact. VENUS OYZO near the inside on the bend,
was through after going a half. RAPIDO GATTA quickly spotted along the rail, faltered. ROMA CARPE abandoned the rail for path two at the half mile pole,
went very wide after leaving the turn until about eight wide, failed to contend.

Footnotes
LEAD GUITAR grabbed a narrow lead after KEPT TRUE was forced to get taken off right after the start, slid over to the inside prior to departing the
backstretch, was lightly hand urged picking up the tempo several ticks during the run around the bend, with the aforementioned foe keeping up all the way,
herself two to three wide and under a more confident ride, turned into the lane with that opponent directly abreast, got cued up in the general area of the
three-sixteenths pole, blew away the others with a strong sprint the rest of the way home, capping off the effort under a hand drive. MADELEINE MUST
(FR) tracked the front runners from just off the rail, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch for the best of racing room, rallied with willingness to
be along for the place. OLENDON (FR) broke slightly to the outside after losing her footing springing from the gate, pursued the pace towards the inside
route on the bend, angled three wide into the stretch, flattened out, losing second. TIPLE (IRE) two wide onto the turn, was sent out into path four exiting it,
got straightened away and was outfinished. KEPT TRUE grabbed after breaking to the outside, pressed the issue two to three wide on the turn, got set
down right where the winner was, that is in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, proved no match, weakened late to finish off the board. KREESIE off a
half beat the slowest, raced two wide on the turn, got steered out into path six during the first half of the stretch drive, had no rally. SISTER SOPHIA faltered
after undergoing a ground-saving journey.

Footnotes
HAPPY SOPHIA coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with CENTRAL EXIT to her inside from the get go, came under light coaxing near the
quarter pole, took over command swinging three wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive drifting out slightly under a near sided stick a sixteenth
from home while holding well to the finish kept busy to the end. LA NEGRITA coaxed from the start, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch in
pursuit from mid pack, got bumped at the nine-sixteenths by SHE'S A BLACK BELT and in turn bumped SUPER CUTE to her outside, tucked four wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors. SHE'S A
BLACK BELT coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide getting out slightly at the nine-sixteenths and bumping LA NEGRITA into SUPER CUTE at
that station before tucking four wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. WICKED TITLE
chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. GESTURE chased three then two
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid but was outfinished in the late stages.
CLASSY SADIE chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, got placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and was outkicked. SHE'S A LUMBERJANE chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. ENOUGH LOVE coaxed
from the gate, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. CENTRAL EXIT
coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of HAPPY SOPHIA from the get go coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, got headed at that station and spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the final furlong. SARAHRINI four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs
from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. SUPER CUTE coaxed from the gate, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, got
bumped by LA NEGRITA due to pressure from SHE'S A BLACK BELT near the nine-sixteenths and was briefly marooned six wide into the turn before able
to tuck four wide just past the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
