Footnotes
DE ONLY SOLUTION bumped AWESOME YET AGAIN at the start, led onto the main track, set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch and
widened under light handling and continued to the wire under a hand ride. AWESOME YET AGAIN, bumped at the start, pressed the pace, chased hard
two-wide on the turn and finished gamely in vain. LAST ENDEAVOR had brief speed then stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn then
finished gamely. GA GA GIZMO bumped with GRAND GIZMO leaving the gate, showed brief speed then stalked the pace, closed three-wide on the turn
and finished under a determined drive. GRAND GIZMO had some early speed then settled in mid pack, came two and three-wide through the turn, chased
into the stretch, was steadied along the rail upper stretch then was game in the late stages. MALIBU MANDATE showed early foot but was taken back, was
hustled three to five-wide on the turn but failed to menace. IMA SILENT FORCE bumped with GA GA GIZMO at the start then showed brief speed, stalked
four-wide on the turn but evened out in the final furlong. FLASHY SIGNATURE dwelt at the break, trailed the field, rode the rail on the turn but never
reached contention. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START CONCERNING FLASHY SIGNATURE CONCLUDED THAT THE HORSE HAD
RECEIVED A FAIR START AND LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

GRATEFUL PRAISE moved up from her off the pace early position to mid pack down the backstretch, continued to rally three to four wide on the turn to
loom outside at the top of the stretch in the five path, drove past the pace setter with two others to her inside nearing the sixteenth pole and persevered to
the wire while laying in the final sixteenth. STORM GAUGE came from mid pack inside the winner two to three wide around the turn, drove to the front in
between rivals outside the sixteenth pole and was in a tight spot with the winner a few times in the final seventy yards while being outkicked to the wire.
HOLD THE APPLAUSE chased the leader a few lengths back, was hustled to go after that one turning for home, had a very brief lead by the sixteenth pole
but could not match the energy of the top pair in the run to the wire. D'S SOUL lost her path when a rival to her inside came out into her path at the start,
dropped well off the pace, rallied nicely in the two path around the turn and closed with a solid run down the lane, right in behind the leaders at the finish.
PODGORA was allowed to drop back soon after breaking well, rallied three wide from off the pace on the turn and into the five path in upper stretch, but her
rallied stalled, only inching up late. CLASSY N' SILENT broke out into a rival's path at the start before recovering quickly to get a clear lead under restraint,
held the advantage until nearing the sixteenth pole before wilting in the final stages. GO GIGI GO GIGI GO settled in mid pack along the inside, was asked
for run midway on the turn but did not respond after a mild move into the stretch. NANA SAV trailed throughout and could only pass a tired foe late. TOUCH
OF ROUGE chased along the inside before dropping back from midway on the turn to the wire. THE RIDER OF THE SECOND PLACE FINISHER, STORM
GAUGE, CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER, GRATEFUL PRAISE, FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL SIXTEENTH. AFTER REVIEW BY THE
STEWARDS, THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

PEACE SEEKER settled in mid pack, saved ground, angled out at the top of the stretch, rallied and swept by the leader a 16th out and held sway under a
drive. NO MO TEMPER stalked the pace in hand, bid two-wide late on the far turn, had the lead at the top of the stretch, was engaged quickly, dueled, was
passed a 16th out then drew away from her rival to save the place position. NIIGON'S SPIN stalked the pace, came three to five-wide through the far turn,
bid upper stretch, dueled, was passed a 16th out and gave way. GO FOR MO raced in mid pack, rode the rail on the far turn, closed upper stretch but failed
to menace. CLOSE IMAGE settled off the pace, closed two to four-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch but never reached contention. GRAND
MESA raced from off the pace, closed three-wide through the far turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch but flattened out in the final 16th. EVIL WOMAN
pressed the early pace, stalked on the far turn then flattened out in the final furlong. SLYDINI bobbled leaving the gate, led early, set a reserved pace in a
race which had little movement until the far turn, remained in the clear until late turn, was swarmed approaching the stretch and tired.
