Footnotes
ALWAYS WORKING was away in good order to duel for the lead with FREESTONE while racing four-wide, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive
and was up in the closing yards. FREESTONE disputed the pace with the winner from off the rail, vied into deep stretch and just missed. RENO ROY was
forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, did not gain on the top pair in the drive but finished well to save the show. SHAMISEN chased
the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. INQUISITION lagged early, saved ground through the turn, angled out in
mid-stretch and was bothered by the loose horse through the final sixteenth. ALL ABOUT TIME stumbled at the start and unseated his rider.

Footnotes
ZANAB stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command inside the quarter, opened a clear lead and held sway to the wire.
CHEROKEE LOUISE chased the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and finished with good courage. SUNSHINE EMILY sprinted clear at
once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and gave way to the winner after going a half. BEAU ROCKS settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. CHOTEAU lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to menace. TIGER MOM broke in the
air, rushed to contention, raced five-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive.

was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished willingly. DON'T REMEMBER lacked early speed, saved ground
through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished evenly late. STANLEY RYDER raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and
failed to threaten. BRETT lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and was not a factor. TRUE REGARDS broke
sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide and weakened through the final furlong. RACE OFFICE showed brief speed, raced five-wide through the
turn and weakened. RIPTIDE ROMEO broke awkwardly, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
STAY IN POWER lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, remained inside and was up in the final yards. GENERAL MACH FOUR pressed the
pace while racing four-wide, came in nearing the half, offered a bid with a sixteenth to run but could not resist the winner late. DAYTONA BEACH was away
in good order to set a pressured pace, came in nearing the half-mile pole, opened a clear margin soon after and gave way late. GRAYCASTER chased the
leaders from the inside, steadied nearing the half-mile marker, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. DALLON'S GOLD was
forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and weakened. EMPIRE RULER showed no early speed, raced
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SLEET AFLEET was void of early foot, raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace. KALAKALA
settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. THE TRAINER OF GRAYCASTER LODGED OBJECTIONS AGAINT
GENERAL MACH FOUR AND DAYTONA BEACH CONCERING THE STEADYING OF GRAYCASTER NEARING THE HALF MILE POLE AND AFTER
REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED GENERAL MACH FOUR FROM SECOND AND PLACED HM THIRD AND DISQUALIFIED
DAYTONA BEACH FROM THIRD AND PLACED HIM FOURTH.

Footnotes
MIKE MAN'S GOLD broke sharply to press the pace of IRON ROB from the inside, vied with that rival into the stretch, opened a clear margin with a
sixteenth to run and drew off. IRON ROB was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the
winner nearing the quarter, vied with that foe and gave way through the final sixteenth. ROCKET POWER was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early,
raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly late. GUARDINGTHEMONEY was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide
through the turn, drifted out into the stretch and failed to gain late. SWAY ROAD settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked
the needed rally. KITTEN'S ROYAL was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ROUGH AND READY reared at the start
and lagged far back throughout.

Footnotes
ARUGULA was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with FLAT OUT FEISTY, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear lead into
the stretch and was ridden out to be kept to task. BLEU MUSKET chased the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but was
up for the place. DROPYOURBUFFS chased the leaders while racing three-wide and failed to gain in the drive. FLAT OUT FEISTY broke sharply to dispute
the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. MENSCH lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out
further in mid-stretch and did not offer a bid. STANLEY'S WAVE showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
STRATEGIC HOUR was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace.
