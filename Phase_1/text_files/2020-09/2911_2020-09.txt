Footnotes
CONGRATSROSY was widest and outrun early, moved in advancing around the turn, rallied near the rail through the stretch, caught AIZU from inside
entering the final furlong and edged away. AIZU set a pressured pace removed from the rail, shook off KATAMA MOONLIGHT around the turn, could not
stave off the winner past the eighth-pole and was clearly second best. LOOKINTOGETLUCKY eyed the leaders from the five-path on the turn, and lacked
the needed closing response. MADDOX lost ground to the front flight on the turn four wide, moved in at the top of the lane and ran on evenly. KATAMA
MOONLIGHT dueled for the early lead outside AIZU, yielded before completing six furlongs, and dropped far back. HUMOR ME DIXIE was forwardly placed
to the turn in the two-path, and gave way before reaching the stretch. ART OF LAW was outrun throughout. GONE CRAZY COCO broke slowly, and was
finished early. PEARLESCENT stumbled a stride from the gate, moved up inside after a half-mile, and retreated around the turn.

Footnotes
CATCHING FISH broke to the lead, let TIRELESS CHAMPION and HE AIN'T NO SAINT go after entering the main track, moved readily to poke a head in
front outside those two after a half-mile, battled inside CON PERMISO through the rest of the turn and into the stretch, and proved best late. CON
PERMISO stayed in easy striking range early, loomed up outside CATCHING FISH as they overtook the pacesetters in tandem past the three-eighths, could
not get by through the lane and settled for the place. FEARLESS LION was outrun early, gained through the furlong grounds while attempting to lug in, and
rallied mildly into the show spot. TIRELESS CHAMPION vied inside HE AIN'T NO SAINT for nearly a half-mile, and tired. THE METHOD hit the left side of
the gate and was slow to begin, saved ground throughout, and failed to seriously menace. HE AIN'T NO SAINT hit the right side of the gate coming out,
contested the pace outside TIRELESS CHAMPION, and gave way before reaching the stretch. OUR GREY GHOST hesitated and was off a beat slow, and
tired after a half.

Footnotes
WHYRUAWESOME pressed KOBE FIFTY TWO from outside, took over after three-eighths of a mile, and drew away from HERO TIGER under pressure.
HERO TIGER lodged a bid outside the leaders late on the turn, was no match for the winner once straightened away for the drive, and was clearly second
best. KOBE FIFTY TWO broke to the lead inside, got overhauled by the winner at the quarter-pole, and gave way. FUZZY IRISH RASCAL faded after three
furlongs in the two-path. MARCELINO was hustled up into traffic and steadied at the nine-sixteenths marker, dropped back inside, had the rider dismount on
the gallop-out, and was ponied back. PURE LUCK hit the left side of the gate at the start, and was outrun four wide.

Footnotes
ANTIGONE got bumped solidly by KAY'S DREAM at the start and was off last, moved up outside horses through the backstretch run, came into the stretch
five or six wide, finished determinedly outside MYCRAZYXGIRLFRIEND and was along in the last 50 yards. MYCRAZYXGIRLFRIEND vied outside
PURPLE PEOPLEEATER early, took over after a half-mile while shifting out four or five wide, shortened stride on her left lead past the eighth-pole and
could not deny the winner. YOU'RE THE BEST broke out bumping KAY'S DREAM into ANTIGONE, lagged well back inside early, moved out approaching
the stretch and rallied mildly. EFFIEMEISTER raced two to three wide in range for a half-mile, and faded in the stretch. TRINNI GIRLS shifted out five wide
late on the turn, and could not reach contention. PURPLE PEOPLEEATER vied early inside, and gave way before going a half. KAY'S DREAM got bumped
into ANTIGONE by YOU'RE THE BEST at the start, and was through early toward the inside.

Footnotes
TOUPHA saved ground unhurried for a half-mile, advanced around the turn, reached contention through a large opening on the rail in upper stretch, and
drew off under a drive. TOSS pursued CAPPY HOUR from outside early, caught that one nearing the quarter-pole, then was outdueled through upper
stretch by the winner. CAPPY HOUR broke outward, sprinted clear removed from the rail, got caught after six furlongs, and yielded. DAKOTA'S DUDE was
never a factor. REMEMBER THE MAINE tired before reaching the stretch two wide. MR. PAPILLON tired four to five wide around the turn, and dropped
back through the lane out past the middle of the track.

RAISON D'AIR took over from FIGO shortly after going a quarter-mile, widened to an insurmountable lead after six furlongs, and was kept driving to the
finish. SLASHING broke in bumping ORULA solidly at the start, came into the stretch four wide, and rallied to go clear of the rest. FIGO led out of the chute,
yielded to RAISON D'AIR after a quarter-mile, stayed on the chase to the top of the stretch, and tired. EL AFORTUNADO raced two wide and never reached
contention. CONGRATS AGAIN raced two wide, and dropped back after six furlongs. UNCUT GEM was never close. INDY LYON was outrun three wide.
BIG CITY RED was finished early inside. ORULA absorbed a hard bump from SLASHING at the start, and retired early. BIG SKY MONTANA stayed close
for a half-mile, and faltered.

Footnotes
DAHLONEGA got bumped into SWEETLY MAID by I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT at the start, vied inside DIXIE PRINCESS for three furlongs, shook clear into
the stretch and drew off under pressure. DIXIE PRINCESS pressed DAHLONEGA from outside, could not stay with her past the three-sixteenths, and held
the place. SWEETLY MAID was bumped by DAHLONEGA at the start, trailed four then five wide through the first three-eighths of a mile, and was along for
the show. I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT broke in bumping DAHLONEGA into SWEETLY MAID, chased in the two-path early, and faded in the stretch. SPEED
STAR tired after three furlongs inside. FIBER OPTIC pressed the pace outside rivals in the four-path, and dropped back steadily past the quarter-pole.

Footnotes
MOZO BELLO bobbled at the start, advanced around the turn four wide, took over outside FREE FLAY and TREV in upper stretch, drifted out from left-hand
pressure past the sixteenth-pole and held SEPTEMBERTEN safe to the wire. SEPTEMBERTEN was bumped by NICHOLAS ROSE at the start, saved
ground at the back early, swung five wide approaching the stretch, rallied outside the winner but could not get by. ARRIVEDERLA was outrun early, fanned
six wide rallying into the lane, then was one-paced to the finish outside the top two. FREE FLAY dueled inside TREV for a half-mile, and weakened in upper
stretch. NICHOLAS ROSE broke in bumping SEPTEMBERTEN, saved ground behind the leaders around the turn, lacked room in upper stretch, and
improved mildly on the rail when clear. TREV vied outside FREE FLAY from the outset, and weakened turning for home. UNPUBLISHED brushed the right
side of the gate and was slowest to begin, moved through early between horses, went three wide around the turn, and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
ROCKET BLAST vied inside SIERRA CAT and KID LEE early, disposed of those two after a half-mile, widened the advantage around the turn, had the rider
lose the whip in upper stretch, and continued to expand the lead urged with goggles. MY CHITU bobbled at the start and was outrun early, swung four wide
into the lane and went by tired horses for the place. KID LEE vied early outside rivals, was under a drive by midway on the turn, and tired. DILIGENT stayed
in range early, came under a ride three wide midway on the turn, and was empty. SIERRA CAT broke slowly, went up to contest the early pace between
horses, stopped abruptly after a half-mile, and jogged in far behind.
