BE LIFTED UP was unhurried while trailing to the turn, swung out for room and rallied four wide into the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch and
edged clear driving. PLEASE ZIP IT prompted the pace two wide to the stretch, responded to mid stretch, got outkicked for the win but gamely bested
SUPER BUNNY for the place. SUPER BUNNY set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to stay on to mid stretch then was weakening late.
GAMBLER'S APPEAL chased the leaders to the turn, was off the rail to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. INCREDIBLY LUCKY
stalked the pace three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and came up empty. MOSCATO GIRL had no speed and saved ground to no
avail.

Footnotes
CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE was unhurried for a half mile, shifted off the rail and rallied three wide on the second turn, lugged out after taking the lead in mid
stretch then was straightened, drifted back in a bit and held driving. BELLA FIGURA (IRE) stalked the pace early, got outkicked to the second turn, bid two
wide to the stretch then was no match for the winner while saving the place. LORETTA set the pace early, pushed away on the backstretch, got overtaken
into the stretch and could not hold second. LOVE OF ART (IRE) had no speed and settled to the second turn, got pushed out to the four path to the stretch
and did not offer a late response. RED BUNTING (IRE) trailed to the second turn, was two then three wide to the stretch but did not threaten in the drive.
SURELY A SMILE was chasing early, got outrun down the backstretch, raced two wide on the far turn but gave out in the stretch. SOPHIE ANTOINETTE
was four wide to the backstretch, chased to the second turn but also gave out after six furlongs.

GLORY CALL hustled to the lead, set the pace in the two path to the stretch then kicked away to mid stretch and held driving. HONG KONG COWBOY
chased the pace two wide to the stretch then finished willingly for the place. IDIOT IN LOVE was also chasing, raced three wide on the turn, got outkicked to
mid stretch and did not rally. JAZZ STREET pressed the winner three wide to the stretch, was outrun to mid stretch and finished evenly. AMERICAN CAMP
got outsprinted early, was off the rail on the turn then steadied hard leaving the quarter pole in tight off heels, dropped back but was gaining ground late.
BABY YOU GOT IT also was outsprinted and saved ground to no avail. OPERA GHOST had no speed, was forced out to the five path into the stretch and
closed a gap without threatening. JU JU GUY lagged three wide to the stretch and was never a threat. STARTENDER had no speed, was outside of
OPERA GHOST and six wide to the stretch then was not a factor. DAXSTER chased the pace from the rail to the stretch then tired.
