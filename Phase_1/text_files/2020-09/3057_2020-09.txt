Footnotes
BLOODPROF saved ground unhurried to the head of the stretch, found room splitting horses past the furlong marker and drove clear. CATCH ON
EMOTIONAL pursued outside the leaders three wide to the stretch, and was up outside PUTMAN to get the place late. PUTMAN set the pace inside for a
half-mile, and weakened in the last furlong. SNOW JOB raced in the two-path around the turn, and lacked the needed rally. ROUGH ENTRY pressed the
pace outside PUTMAN, got shaken off after three furlongs, and tired. PRINCE IGOR steadied in tight along the rail inside SNOW JOB approaching the turn,
and tired. This race was hand timed, fractional times unavailable.

Footnotes
GENERIC MARK was a bit slow into stride and allowed to settle early, split horses advancing midway on the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, caught
MY MASTERPIECE from inside past the eighth-pole and drove clear. MONEY FACTOR trailed early three wide, moved to the four-path improving position
after six furlongs, and rallied on the far outside to get up for second. TOO MUCH WAR was never far back, moved out three wide approaching the lane with
aim outside the leader, lacked a solid final response and got the show between horses. MY MASTERPIECE grabbed the early lead inside, came two or
three paths off the rail at the top of the stretch, was no match for the winner, and was overhauled late for larger shares. ITS ABOUT ME raced forwardly
inside early, and dropped back after a half-mile. STRONG GEM tracked three wide for six furlongs, and tired. HELEN HAYES saved ground, steadied
entering the far turn, and could not recover. BLAME THE GODS was no factor three to four wide. MOTHERWELL pressed MY MASTERPIECE from outside
to the far turn, and gave way.

Footnotes
AYCAPOTE set a pressured early pace inside NIMBLE BEAST and SKYLINE VIEW, edged away after six furlongs, settled into the stretch in the three-path
and held sway under a drive. NIMBLE BEAST pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, had aim outside AYCAPOTE in the four-path turning
for home, ran on with good courage but did not have enough to get by. HIGHWAY FLYER steadied along the inside near the half-mile pole, stayed on the
rail advancing around the turn, and finished evenly on his left lead. POWER (BRZ) lacked the needed response in the two-path. SKYLINE VIEW pressed
the pace outside rivals for a half-mile, and gave way around the turn. BOURBONROX got bumped by CASTILLETE at the start, and was finished after a
half. ULTRACONFIDENT trailed leaving the chute, moved up through the backstretch run, but could not sustain the bid. CASTILLETE broke in and took the
worst of a bump with BOURBONROX, and was through early. O DANNY BOY retired after a half.

Footnotes
SHARM EL SHEIKH took control at the start, shook off PROJECTED turning for home, and responded to remain clear. MORNING STRIDE steadied along
the rail as DONJI dropped over in front of him nearing the first turn, split horses a quarter-mile out, and finished well to narrow the gap. DONJI brushed the
right side of the gate coming out, moved to the rail approaching the first turn, stayed inside the rest of the way, and gained mildly in the stretch without
threatening. CAN'T TRUMP KITTEN was outrun for six furlongs in the two-path, swung four wide for the drive and rallied mildly. PROJECTED (GB) pressed
the pace outside SHARM EL SHEIKH, could not get past under heavy pressure midway on the far turn, and tired in the stretch. UNLOCKTHEPOTENTIAL
saved ground to no avail. INDEPENDENT WORKER stayed close three wide early, and gave way after six furlongs. I AINT TELLIN broke slowly and was
never close.

CHARGE ACCOUNT was a step slow from the gate, got out of last approaching the half-mile pole, advanced inside around the turn under a hold, slipped
through inside BEAST OF WILDWOOD to wrest the lead away in upper stretch, and drove clear while drifting out. BEAST OF WILDWOOD set the pace
slightly off the rail, got overhauled from the inside by the winner turning for home, and ran on to hold the place. WORDS OF DEVINE chased outside BEAST
OF WILDWOOD to the top of the stretch, and had no late response. REGGAE REVOLUTION faded in the two-path nearing the stretch. IMA DAREDEVIL
broke very awkwardly to the left, advanced to loom a threat on the turn three then four wide, and gave way in the stretch. ITSENOUGH broke open the gate
prior to the start, and was finished around the turn.

Footnotes
KING BUDDHA broke outward, rated along setting an even pace for six furlongs, responded through the drive and stayed clear while drifting out.
GOLOVKIN pressed the pace between horses, moved in through the stretch and ran on well. RAULITO saved ground on the turns, shifted out for the drive
and finished with interest. BARNEGAT LIGHT was ridden along inside midway on the far turn, came three wide for the drive, and gained mildly outside.
GHOSTLYPRINCE tracked outside the leaders three wide to the stretch, and faded. CALLSUMONEWHOCARES came in slightly at the start, went along
behind the leading trio on the far turn, and lacked a solid final response on the rail. LIAMS STAR was no factor two wide. MAGICAL ADVENTURE lacked
room between KING BUDDHA and CALLSUMONEWHOCARES and checked at the start, and was never close. UNCLE PIP dropped far back after a
half-mile. FORTY FLASH was outrun early inside, and dropped far back after a half.

Footnotes
SOLID AS A ROCK broke in and bumped with MISS MAC at the start, vied outside SHES ONE MAD MOMMA early, disposed of that one and was joined
from outside by SAY ADIOS and MISS MAC five-sixteenths out, fended those two off in upper stretch only to have VARSOVIA loom up on the far outside,
and edged away determinedly. VARSOVIA ranged up four wide after a half-mile, had aim outside SOLID AS A ROCK through the furlong grounds, and
came up second best. SAY ADIOS stayed close early, challenged between horses five-sixteenths out, and weakened between the top two finishers through
the last furlong. MISS MAC got bumped between SHES ONE MAD MOMMA and SOLID AS A ROCK at the start, bid outside rivals late on the turn, and
gave way into the lane. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA broke out and bumped MISS MAC at the start, vied early inside, and weakened after three furlongs.
BLESSED BEAST raced four then three wide in range early, and lacked the needed response. MIZ CHAPLIN was outrun inside. TALE OF V K became
fractious behind the gate and loaded without the rider, and was outrun. MARDI GRAS GIRL threw her head at the break, dwelt and came out well behind
the field, and went along far back throughout. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

LEGENDARY PRINCE chased HENRY'S WORLD from a distance for three-eighths of a mile, finished determinedly through the lane, and caught the leader
from outside in the final strides. HENRY'S WORLD sped right to the front, was clear in the two-path through most of the stretch run on his left lead, and was
nailed at the finish. SASSY BUT SMART bumped solidly with LEGAL DEAL at the start, was outrun in the two-path to the stretch, and closed strongly
outside the top two late. GRAN OLD PARR was in range between horses up the backstretch, dropped back early on the turn, had the three-path into the
lane and lacked a solid bid. WEEKEND DREAMER chased inside from the start, and made no headway on the rail through the lane. LEGAL DEAL bumped
hard with SASSY BUT SMART at the start, was outrun for three furlongs, angled to the far outside at the head of the stretch, and made up some ground
without becoming a factor. IKEISGREAT was outrun inside. REMASTER (IRE) went wrong in the right front on the turn and lost the rider, was apprehended
after running loose to the stretch, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
TREVESS got off to a flat-footed start at the rear, advanced inside around the turn, came off the rail rallying into the stretch, finished resolutely and caught
REITERATE from outside in the final strides. REITERATE broke to the lead, rated along well in command to the stretch, shortened stride still clear past the
70-yard marker, and could not hang on. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE had a ground-saving journey, had aim along the rail turning for home, but needed more.
MATRACA raced five wide around the turn, and improved outside for the last major share. COMMANDING LADY raced three then four wide around the
turn, had no final response, and was vanned off after the finish. KEEP AMERICA GREAT was finished early three wide. I'M A ROCKSTAR chased after the
pacesetter from outside to the top of the stretch, was empty from there and was being eased up through the late stages. MIAMI ROSE raced two wide and
was through early. DELTA HUTCH dropped back three wide on the turn, and was eased up late.
