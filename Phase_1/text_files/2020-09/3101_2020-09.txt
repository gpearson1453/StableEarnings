Footnotes
LANIER tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to
the task. HEY BIG GUY allowed to settle, looped up four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and closed well for the place. REAL
FACTOR allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and edged up late for the show. POST CLOSE
never far back, moved to position three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, weakened and held a share. RED CAT (CHI) passed tiring
rivals. HOME RUN TRICK broke out at the start, moved up to stalk the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second
turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and faded. WATCH HER STRUT mid pack, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through
inside of rivals and weakened in the drive. LESS THAN PERFECT set the pace on the inside, shook clear down the backstretch, stayed on when challenged
into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. WESTERN CRUSADER was never involved.

Footnotes
RIVERSIDE WALK (GB) set the pace on the inside while bearing out, shook clear in the lane and lasted under strong right hand urging. A LITTLE
FLATTERED allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, closed well late and missed. OUR GIRL SNICK
tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed. SIX FIRE mid pack, moved
up while angling out through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up for a share. COUNTRY THUNDER well placed and outside, gained a striking
position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and weakened in the drive. LOOKIN PERFECT was no factor. JEALOUS HEART
stalked the pace on the outside, held position through the turn, drifted out four wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong.
