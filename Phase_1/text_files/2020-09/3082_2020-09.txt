SPIRIT OF LIFE Well placed four wide into the turn, gained to take on the leader nearing the quarter pole, battled outside in the lane with GRAPHITE
DUTCHESS and bested that one for the score. GRAPHITE DUTCHESS Ducked out at the start, tossed her head after that, two path into the turn, took the
rail entering the stretch, gained to reach the winner a furlong out, battled and finished gamely. LASAGNA Unhurried four wide into the turn, five wide out of it
and finished with interest. MORNING PLEASURE Tracked early, three path on the turn and weakened. MISS AUTHENTICITEE Bumped at the start, three
path on the turn and weakened inside. WRONGSIDEOFHISTORY Saved ground and tired. MADDY BLACK Broke sharply, set the pace along the two path
to the top of the lane and gave way.
