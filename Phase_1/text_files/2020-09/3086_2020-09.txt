Footnotes
IRISH PRIORITY dueled from between foes early, remained engaged through the turn, shook loose entering the drive, opened a clear margin at the eighth
pole and held sway. THAT'S A SONG stalked the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded when sat down for the drive but
could not reach the winner. LUCKY TAYLOR chased the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, altered outside for the drive, responded
and rallied late for the show. COOL DEAL outrun early, advanced outside through the turn, responded and had a late rally. RUNNING ROSADO could only
improve position. FLASH COPY dueled from between foes but came up empty in the drive. DR. FRANKIE KAYE forced the early pace outside and tired.
CHATAIN'S FLYER chased the early pace and faded. FLAT SCAT dueled from the outside and tired. MISS PAR T was crowded at the start and no factor.
SECRET PRINCESS dueled from the inside early and gave way. WIND ZEE was no threat. Five eights split time unavailable due to a timer malfunction.

Footnotes
WIDOW OF NAIN unhurried early from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, inched closer entering the second turn, responded when sat down
for the drive and steadily drew clear. LINDA GOT LUCKY broke sharp from the outside, gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch,
continued to show the way through the second turn, remained well clear at the eighth pole but could not last while just lasting for the place. TWO SKIES
outrun early, steadily advanced through the second turn, responded when asked and closed with a rush to just miss the place. GILDED APPLE well placed
early from the inside, chased the pace up the backstretch, remained forward for the drive but could not keep pace. CLOUDYWITHACHANCE forced the
early pace outside but had nothing left. HIGHTAIL RUNAWAY chased the early pace and tired. NITRA was never a factor. WHISKEY TO WINE was no
threat. MS. SPARKLING JET was never close. One mile split time unavailable due to a timer malfunction.
