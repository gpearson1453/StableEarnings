Footnotes
DANCING CRANE brushed with SHARP PRIZE at the start, tracked the leaders three wide to the stretch, and wore down SHEZA HAPPY GIRL from
outside to win going away. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL pressed SIERRA DIAMOND from outside, took over at the top of the stretch and pulled clear, stayed on
her left lead until inside the 70-yard marker, and could not hold on. LUCI BREEZE lagged far back early inside, moved out in upper stretch and was along to
be a distant third. BELLA BASORA saved ground throughout, and lacked the needed response. SIERRA DIAMOND cleared to the early lead inside, got
caught by SHEZA HAPPY GIRL approaching the top of the lane, and tired. SHARP PRIZE brushed with DANCING CRANE at the start, and was no factor
toward the inside. PALACE GIRL broke awkwardly, and was outrun four wide. MERMAID'S TEAR was outrun three wide. CORINTHIA showed nothing.

Footnotes
CACTUS KITTEN was slow into stride and unhurried early inside, came under a ride and began picking off rivals four wide around the far turn, caught the
leaders from outside into the final furlong, and was driving to 70 yards out. DREAM ADRIANNA stayed in range two to three wide from the outset, could not
kick on with the winner but went clear of the rest. MIRANDA SOFIA tracked outside the leaders four then three wide, loomed outside TINIKKA LORRAINE in
upper stretch, but could not sustain the rally. TINIKKA LORRAINE set a pressured pace inside, stayed on past the furlong marker, and weakened.
DREAMINOFDASIES was a step slow at the break, then steadied in tight as rivals came her way from adjacent stalls, saved ground outrun to the stretch,
moved out and improved position while never a factor. STARSHIP BLANCA made no impact through a four-wide trip. WELLINGTONS ROSE broke a step
slow, steadied in tight between rivals two strides out, and never reached contention. IRISH THUNDER pressed the pace from outside for a half-mile, and
retreated on the far turn. MARIANNA QUEEN saved ground for six furlongs, and had no response in the stretch. UPSTAGING was outrun throughout.
RACK DADDY was always outrun. SASSY GIDGET trailed all the way.

Footnotes
WORTH AVENUE tracked outside the leaders into the turn, took over four wide with five-sixteenths remaining, and widened steadily under pressure. SALSA
RITA was well placed behind the embattled leaders on the turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied to best the others. J'S INDIAN CHARM brushed
with TAKECHARGE MIRELLA at the start while away alertly, led into the turn with pressure from both sides, and yielded after three-eighths of a mile.
TAKECHARGE MIRELLA brushed with J'S INDIAN CHARM at the start, trailed to the top of the lane shifting outward, and could not gain. ITSENOUGH was
sent up to vie inside rivals early, and could not keep pace after three furlongs. NONCENTS contested the early pace three wide, drifted wider dropping back
off the turn, and was eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
VUYELWA was never far back, went after SIGNING BONUS from outside after a half-mile, took over in the three-path under her own power midway on the
turn, was roused from upper stretch to the sixteenth-pole, and coasted in much the best. BENNY'S GIRLFRIEND moved off the rail after five furlongs,
advanced between horses at the top of the stretch, and went clear for the place. SURPRISE ARRIVAL dropped back around the turn, came four wide into
the stretch and was along for the show outside. SIGNING BONUS set the early pace inside, was no match for the winner after five furlongs, and gave way.
DARESCA was no factor three wide. CALLMESENORITA moved up four wide after six furlongs, then flattened out. CAPTURED LIGHT was forwardly
placed inside when she veered in sharply and took up going off stride at the end of the chute, nearly striking the temporary rail and fortunate to have the
rider stay on, and did not recover while moving to the far outside. SILVER PALMS tired after a half-mile inside. SANDBAH showed brief speed and tired.
This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
SPINNING KITTEN eyed the leaders in striking range early, bid for command between horses three wide on the far turn, took over in upper stretch and
edged away, then held off STRONG HEADED through the final stages. STRONG HEADED raced in the second flight unhurried early, came three wide into
the lane, moved outside the winner and was closing in steadily near the wire. MAVERICK KITTEN settled well off the early pace inside, moved out
approaching the far turn attempting to loop the field, came five wide into the stretch unable to quicken sufficiently, and was along outside for the show lightly
urged the last sixteenth of a mile. CITY PARK prompted the pace two wide, lodged a bid between horses on the far turn, and gave way through the furlong
grounds. SKYRAY moved menacingly four wide into the far turn, but flattened out after straightening away for the drive. ROAD TO PEACE failed to
seriously threaten. MR. WHO set the pace inside, got caught after six furlongs, and retreated.

AVANT GARDE settled between horses early, moved out three wide late on the far turn, wrested command outside SNAP HOOK at the top of the stretch
and drew off under a drive. SNAP HOOK tracked outside BRASSTOWN early, took over after six furlongs, proved no match for the winner turning for home,
and was clearly second best. BRASSTOWN set the early pace inside, relinquished command to SNAP HOOK midway on the far turn, moved out into upper
stretch and ran on for the show. TRAPPEZOID saved ground to no avail. CREATE AGAIN raced three wide, and tired after six furlongs. IL FARAONE lost
contact with the field early, felt the whip up the backstretch, and offered nothing.

Footnotes
KRAMMY BOY was well placed off the leading trio into the turn, moved up four wide to challenge outside GAME BOY BENNY after a half-mile, and
outdueled that rival through the stretch. GAME BOY BENNY vied inside TIP SHEET and TOWN POLICY early, put those two away after three furlongs,
responded when hooked from outside by KRAMMY BOY coming to the quarter-pole, and yielded grudgingly after a long drive. BLACK PEPPER got pushed
in by CHARGE CARD at the start and was outrun early, came four wide rallying into the lane, and went clear of the rest. SMOKE 'N' GLOAT bumped with
TOWN POLICY at the start, and posed no threat. FOURTH DESIGN was no factor inside. POWER WALKER was outrun four wide. TOWN POLICY
bumped with SMOKE 'N GLOAT at the start, came back in and pushed CHARGE CARD into BLACK PEPPER, vied outside GAME BOY BENNY and TIP
SHEET early, and tired. TIP SHEET contested the early pace between horses, and faltered after a half-mile. CHARGE CARD got pushed into BLACK
PEPPER by TOWN POLICY at the start, trailed a long way last, and was eased up in the lane.

Footnotes
MONFORTE grabbed the lead with an alert start, was mildly roused to extend the advantage turning for home, and stayed clear hand urged and shown the
whip late. LURE HIM IN saved ground moving up after a half-mile, switched out three wide at the top of the stretch, overhauled CITRUS BURST from
outside for the place in deep stretch, and narrowed the gap on the winner without seriously threatening. CITRUS BURST hugged the rail around the turns
forwardly placed, had a clear shot at MONFORTE in the two-path into the lane, could not make an impression on the leader, and yielded second late.
CADET CONNELLY was bumped and cut off by SASSY BUT SMART at the start, lagged well back to the stretch, and improved past tired horses outside.
SURPRISE FACTOR brushed the right side of the gate coming out, raced three wide and made no impact. SASSY BUT SMART broke out bumping CADET
CONNELLY and cutting that one off, had the two-path until moving inside nearing the stretch, and could not gain. SINGINGINTHEJOHN was keyed up
heading into the first turn four then three wide, and tired after a half-mile. GRACEFUL KITTEN pursued the winner from outside for a half, and stopped on
the far turn. Run-up distance unavailable.

the pace hounded by the winner for nearly six furlongs, and ran on with good courage to salvage second. GRACE'S DRAMA raced three to four wide
around the turn, and could not gain on the leaders through the drive. ASSUME CONTROL was forwardly placed toward the inside early, and weakened in
the stretch. NOWITNA RIVER lagged far back to the stretch, and passed tired horses. NOTE TO SELFIE bumped with PICASSO MOON at the start, and
tired after a half-mile. BABIE MONSTER was finished early four wide. PICASSO MOON bumped with NOTE TO SELFIE at the start, and was outrun.

Footnotes
MARIES MELODY broke alertly, took over outside FUJAIRAH approaching the backstretch and moved in, came under a ride outside the quarter-pole to
fend off several challenges, and found more through the lane to hold sway. DROP A HINT prompted the pace from outside three then two wide, and stayed
on well. FUJAIRAH took the lead inside heading to the first turn, deferred to MARIES MELODY before going a quarter-mile, saved ground in range to the
stretch, and finished willingly. BLUE MISTRESS raced in striking range three wide from the outset, bid between horses a quarter-mile out, and was
outfinished. MERSEYSIDE settled in the two-path for most of the trip, and was one-paced through the lane. LADY PANDA broke slowly, advanced four wide
around the far turn, and flattened out. MO OF THE WEST had the rider lose the left iron shortly after the start, moved off the rail after the rider recovered the
stirrup early on the first turn, and lacked a solid response. MEADOW BEAUTY broke slowly, and was outrun inside. ONYX was never prominent. LAVI was
always outrun. Run-up distance unavailable.

Footnotes
COOL ARROW broke alertly, was ridden along three wide on the turn with pressure to his outside, stayed on task through a long drive and wore down
KRSTO SKYE from outside in the last 70 yards. KRSTO SKYE shadowed WEISSER from outside early, wrested command past the three-eighths and
pulled clear, dug in through the lane and yielded grudgingly. DOUBLE CROWN advanced in the two-path after a half-mile, cut the corner to loom a threat on
the rail turning for home, but flattened out through the final furlong. WITH VERVE saved ground outsprinted early, fanned widest into the lane and could not
gain appreciably. OURNATIONONPARADE was urged along four wide to stay in range around the turn, and faded in the stretch. WEISSER was hustled up
to get the early lead inside, yielded to KRSTO SKY after three furlongs, and gave way.

Footnotes
SPEED FRANCO broke in bumping DEBDURITE into MASON'S SONG, stalked outside the former for a half-mile, took over on the far turn and moved
inside, and widened under a mild drive. NOTSOSUBTLE leaned all over DEVOTED KITTEN out of the gate and steadied having to be pulled off, moved up
with a four-wide run on the far turn, and rallied to go clear for the place. MASON'S SONG was bumped by DEBDURITE at the start, advanced around the
far turn in the four-path, and was outfinished for the runner-up spot. DUKE OF MONROE saved ground on the turns, and lacked the needed response.
DEVOTED KITTEN had NOTSOSUBTLE draped all over him and got pushed into UNLIMITED DATA after the start, moved up four wide approaching the
stretch, and ran by tired horses. ROCK THE CAUSEWAY broke out at the start, went along in the middle of the pack to the lane, and had no rally.
UNLIMITED DATA got bumped and pushed in by DEVOTED KITTEN in the shadow of the starting gate, and was outrun inside. FANTASIZING was
forwardly placed early, got closest to SPEED FRANCO around the far turn, but could not sustain the bid. MACHIAVELLI got bumped by GRAYDAR'S
