Footnotes
TOCCETIVE JAC settled at the back and inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, progressed along the rail through the second turn, was all out in the
stretch and took the advantage inside the final sixteenth. DAVKA jostled briefly with ITALIAN CHARM just after the break, pressed the pace three wide,
went for the lead on the second bend, did not keep up entering the lane but came again deep stretch and caught JOEY B for second. JOEY B was sent to
be well placed inside from the beginning, bid for the lead along the rail after a half mile, floated out leaving the second turn, fought gamely to the wire but did
not have enough left in the waning yards. ITALIAN CHARM jostled briefly just after the start, was settled, advanced from outside to gain the advantage
approaching the final quarter mile, battled through the stretch but weakened in the late going. VENKMAN chased staying well off the inside and was never a
factor. GARRISON COMMANDER set a pressured pace from just off the inside, was challenged from both sides on the second bend, began to yield, was
checked when his path narrowed at the quarter pole, floated out entering the lane and steadily gave way.

Footnotes
WARY CARRIE shared the early lead off the rail but inside rivals, moved clear when allowed on the turn, was roused leaving the bend, floated out entering
the stretch and lengthened command under a drive the last furlong. EQUALLY EVEN bumped at the start, was settled inside, picked up her pace along the
rail into the turn and continued her rally to edged ahead for second with a sixteenth left. TWO MORE TIMES settled outside, lost ground four wide on the
bend, fanned out behind INNER DELIGHT into the lane, altered in some soon after, rallied and caught MINING FOR PEARLS for third. MINING FOR
PEARLS contested the pace between rivals on the backstretch, moved clear for second from path three on the bend, angled in some entering the stretch,
slowly yielded between rivals the last furlong and had to be vanned off after the race. INNER DELIGHT in contention from inside on the backstretch, did not
stay close after a quarter mile, angled out through the turn, came widest into the stretch and closed the gap too late deep stretch. RUNNING SCARED
displayed early speed from outside but began to yield on the bend. GARDEN OF EDNA broke outward, bumping solidly with EQUALLY EVEN, helped
prompt the early pace but gave way two wide on the turn.

Footnotes
COUNTRY JO settled off the rail, commenced her bid between rivals on the turn, came into the lane from path five, altered in midstretch for a clear path,
closed well and gained the advantage with sixty yards to go. SOUTHERN ATTACK fractious in the gate, raced in contention from outside on the
backstretch, progressed three wide on the turn, floated out to path five entering the stretch, drifted out some as she rallied under left-handed pressure in the
late going and narrowly missed. MEETMEINSTLOUIE reluctant to load, shared the early lead from outside once the race began, moved ahead on the bend,
floated out to path four into the lane, slowly wore down between rivals deep stretch but was easily best of the rest. MISS GAVEL chased from inside, angled
out leaving the turn, came into the stretch behind SOUTHERN ATTACK and passed tired ones. POSITIONEDTOWIN was forwardly placed early but faded
three wide on the bend. BARBIELLO failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. COMMANDING MIDAS contested the pace inside MEEMEINSTLOUIE on the
backstretch, did not keep up leaving the turn and gave way the last furlong. GO PADDY JO showed little in a wide trip.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD SECRET showed first, was briefly urged to move ahead of the rest, roused again leaving the turn, opened up on the field and was kept to a
drive the final eighth. BABA LOU was soon well back and kept well off the inside, angled in some as he picked up his pace on the turn, rallied two wide in
the stretch, split foes inside the last furlong and caught UGO for second nearing the wire. UGO gradually angled out through the backstretch, came four
wide into the lane, dueled for second, edged ahead for the place deep stretch but was outfinished. POCKET PLAYER without early speed, lodged a mild bid
from inside into the stretch but weakened in the late going. TAP'S BIG SHOT pressed WILDWOOD SECRET from outside for a half mile, was no match for
that one when set down for the drive and gradually wore down between rivals.

BURKHART bumped at the break, took the early lead, showed the way just off the inside, was challenged from inside on the second turn, battled back in the
lane, drifted out some midstretch, was straightened, moved clear with a sixteenth to go and held sway. AMSALOR progressed from outside on the
backstretch, was four wide through the second bend, rallied belatedly but caught B APPRECIATIVE for second nearing the wire. B APPRECIATIVE broke
inward bumping BURKHART, bounced off that one and into SKIPTOTHEWIRE, recovered to press BURKHART from just outside, angled inside the late
midstretch, gained second with seventy yards left but was outfinished in a game effort. SKIPTOTHEWIRE bumped at the break, was outrun for a position
between horses into the first bend, altered out, was kept close just off the inside, went for the lead along the rail on the second turn, had a slight advantage
leaving that bend but slowly wore down inside the last furlong. BELLA MY ELLA showed little in a wide trip. PHOENIX ATTACK pressed four wide for five
furlongs then began to fade.

Footnotes
SHMILY was urged up between rivals to stalk the early pace, went for the lead two wide on the bend, edged ahead under a drive upper stretch and drew
clear under steady urging the final furlong. AT GUARD soon sprinted clear, was challenged from outside nearing the half mile marker, did not keep up
leaving the turn, fought to hold second in the lane and held off GREAT SCAT for the place. GREAT SCAT pressed from outside, vied for the lead outside
SHMILY on the bend, could not stay with that one upper stretch, battled for second but did not have enough left. GONZO raced in contention from inside on
the backstretch, angled out through the turn, came into the lane five wide and made up minor ground the last eighth. STORMY PACIFIC was prominent
from just off the inside, fanned out some entering the lane, angled out four wide for a clear path upper stretch and flattened the final furlong. NOT
CHOPPED LIVER failed to menace in a wide trip. MR. LUV MAKER was a factor four wide on the backstretch but gave way from between foes on the bend.

Footnotes
COOL AMBITION rated from outside on the backstretch, angled in on the bend, was put to a drive, altered to the rail entering the stretch to gain a clear
path, was all out and got up in time. W W KAN DO broke outward, bumping CITY POSITION, vied for the lead between rivals, moved clear on the turn,
floated out some into the stretch, slowly wore down the last furlong and was outfinished. CITY POSITION bumped at the break, was kept close from outside,
took over second three wide on the bend, fanned outside W W KAN DO entering the stretch, had every chance but lacked the needed late kick in a game
effort. STEALIN' SUMMER progressed to contention four wide on the turn, swung out some for the drive and found best stride too late. GALAHAD KID
without early speed, was two wide on the turn, lost ground fanning widest into the stretch and showed a willingness to run late. MUSIAL was soon well back
and inside, commenced his bid from inside leaving the bend, gradually angled out upper stretch and passed between tired ones the final furlong. UNCLE
PAPPY contested the early pace inside W W KAN DO, did not stay with that one on the bend, fanned to path three for the stretch run, weakened between
rivals, altered out for a clear path with a sixteenth left and continued to fade. BUDDY BUD raced in contention between rivals on the backstretch, retreated
three wide on the bend, fanned out behind STEALIN' SUMMER entering the lane, altered out some upper stretch, failed to have a significant bid and was
checked when UNCLE PAPPY took his path with a sixteenth left. COUNTRY COOL was forwardly placed inside for a half mile, floated out some into the
stretch and gave way.
