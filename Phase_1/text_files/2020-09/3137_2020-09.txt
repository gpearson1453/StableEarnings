Footnotes
CANADIAN SECRET pressed the pace, dueled on the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch, rebid a furlong out and edged ahead in the late stages,
driving. HELL BENT settled off the pace, closed late backstretch, was hustled two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined
drive. RED RETURN moved up to duel on the main track, battled through the turn, took a short lead at the top of the stretch, was rejoined and gave way
grudgingly in the 16th. STOP THE HUMBUG settled off the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn, was blocked entering the stretch, angled out
quickly and rallied gamely. ARTIE MY BOY stalked the pace on the backstretch, dropped back early turn, was hustled three and four-wide then evened out
late. ROMEOS LAW moved up to force the early pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn but lacked a rally. DEN OF THIEVES broke alertly, set a
pressured pace, was joined in a duel on the main track, dropped back a bit to stalk into the turn, chased to the stretch and evened out.

Footnotes
MY LADIES' MAN exchanged light bumps with WATCHNSEE leaving the gate, stalked the pace then pressed the issue three-wide on the far turn, chased
into the stretch, closed steadily and was up just in time. SON OF MY FATHER set a pressured pace, shook clear midway through the final turn, was all out
in the stretch but was nipped at the wire. KOMUNIST settled off the pace, steadied nearing the 1st turn, traveled along the rail until late on the far turn,
angled out approaching the stretch then rallied gamely. I DANCE ALONE stalked early then chased hard on the far turn then finished gamely. LIQUID
LOUIE stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn, was steadied at the top of the stretch then tendered a mild rally. BREAD CRUMBS
raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response. FRAT PARTY forced the pace, was hustled on the far turn,
chased into the stretch then flattened out in the final furlong. WATCHNSEE shared some bumping with MY LADIES' MAN at the outset, raced from off the
pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn then lacked a rally.

Footnotes
SEGUIMI sprinted to a clear early lead, set the pace, was under light pressure on the backstretch, quickened on the far turn and finished well in hand. ICE
BLUE stalked the pace, chased two-wide and from the rail on the far turn then finished gamely. PERFECT REVENGE settled in mid pack, was hustled hard
three-wide on the far turn then closed determinedly through the stretch. SILENT EMPIRE stalked the pace, chased three-wide on the far turn but failed to
menace. DENMARK, close up early, pressed the pace on the backstretch, chased two-wide on the far turn then posted a late effort in vain. ONE MORE
DRIFT raced in mid pack, was hustled four then three-wide on the far turn but was never contentious. COUNTRYSIDE DRIVE was rated off the pace, trailed
on the far turn, was eased in the stretch, crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
HEY CONGRATS pressed the pacesetter, lodged his bid at the top of the stretch, battled, and prevailed under a drive. LORD OF LEGENDS set a
pressured pace, was engaged at the top of the stretch, dueled, but gave way grudgingly in the late stages. SEA SCOUT was off slowly, moved up the rail to
take a run at the lead but didn't quite reach the front and stalked the pace, was hustled along the fence on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished all
out. SHARP'S RIVER settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then rallied gamely. SILENT RISK was off slowly, raced in mid pack,
was pinched back along the rail early turn, was hustled into the stretch then closed fast in the late stages. ROOKIE GIRL raced in mid pack, was hustled
three and four-wide on the turn then finished evenly. SWEET SYDNEY settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but evened out late.
RIGHTEOUS ROBBIE, away slowly, raced off the pace, closed three-wide late turn but evened out in deep stretch. COLTON SHAFT, away slowly, settled
off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
CORDUROY ROAD set a reserved pace, quickened on the turn, was engaged upper stretch, was headed but dug in and came back to nail his rival on the
wire. EXPLODE showed early speed then forced the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn, bid upper stretch, battled, gained a short lead but failed to
stave off the winner in the final yards. COLEYVILLE was away slowly, settled off the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn, tipped out at the top
of the stretch and put in a strong stretch run from the outside and just missed. AVIE'S MESA stalked early then raced two-wide from mid pack on the turn
then finished under a determined drive. CARMENOOTZ, in mid pack early, closed four then three-wide on the turn but evened out in deep stretch. KING
AND HIS COURT was off slowly and settled in mid pack, rode the rail on the turn, was blocked at the top of the stretch and evened out. NEVAEH'S
VALENTINE was in range early, came three and four-wide from mid pack on the turn then lacked a rally. DRENA'S BULLET, off slowly, stalked the pace
from the rail, chased into the stretch but was empty when asked.

FORESTER'S DESTINY raced from off the pace, closed along the rail early on the far turn, remained behind rivals and was patient to the stretch, rallied
smartly and swept to the lead a furlong out and widened under a hand ride. BOLD ANIMAUX led into the first turn, set the pace, was joined midway of the
far turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch, was passed by FORESTER'S DESTINY a furlong out but held place. CAT ZAPPER settled in mid pack early,
stalked on the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished all out. SPANISH RIVER pressed the pace, lapped onto the leader early on the far turn, bid in
earnest at the 3/4 mark, was headed at the top of the stretch and chased. MOON MAGIC stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn
and finished evenly. TISHINA settled the off pace, was hustled two-wide and from the rail on the far turn but never reached contention. SEATTLE
TREASURE raced off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn but lacked a rally.
