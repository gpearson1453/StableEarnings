UP JUST IN TIME vied along the inside, drew clear on the turn, widened in the stretch and was taken in hand late. LI'LBITO'CHARM bobbled at the start
then rallied along the inside with late energy. SHATTER ME chased wide throughout and flattened out through the stretch. HEROIC OFFICER saved
ground, moved closer on the turn then proved empty. I'AM A UNICORN chased between rivals early and lacked a rally. EZ ON THE EYES was urged close
up in the two path then steadied slightly between rivals tiring in the stretch. BETTER BEGIN lagged well behind and passed a fading opponent. RISQUE'S
TREASURE forced the pace outside through the opening quarter then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
AIR ATTACK raced wide throughout, took the lead near furlong grounds and while drifting out under left handed pressure, just lasted. JEROME AVENUE,
between foes, took the lead near quarter pole and edged away near mid stretch, fought gamely to the wire and just missed. MUCHO MACHO EDDIE set the
pace inside, drifted out leaving the turn and weakened late. EXTRA MEDIUM, racing two wide while never far back, faded in the drive. CHRISATUDE saved
ground, angled out in mid stretch and tired. VERO SUN was wide throughout and no real threat.

RAZOR GIRL lunged then came out and bumped Misquillo leaving the gate then was bumped by PEPPER POT soon after, saved ground just off the pace,
rallied between foes through stretch, was brushed by RISING LIGHT DEEP stretch and while drifting out, got the decision PEPPER POT was bumped
around soundly leaving the gate, raced in the three path while just off the pace, moved out three wide into stretch, challenged and loomed boldly through
deep, while drifting out, and missed. RISING LIGHT set the pace in the three path, opened a long lead on the backstretch, drifted out and brushed winner in
deep stretch and held on tenaciously. PEGASUS IN FLIGHT was just clobbered from both sides leaving gate causing her rider to lose his lost left iron, she
eventually recovered and raced along the rail, made a nice run to challenge near stretch and fought with tremendous courage to the wire. MISQUILLO was
unruly prestart and was bumped leaving the gate, raced wide, drifted out badly through stretch and lacked a strong kick. BROAD JUMPER clipped the heels
of BOURBON AIDE after the start then was never a serious threat. BOURBON AIDA came out sharply leaving gate causing crowding and bothering several
rivals, she had her heels clipped soon after, raced just off pace, stopped suddenly on the backstretch, was pulled up and vanned off. THE STEWARDS LITE
THE INQUIRY CONCERNING THE INCIDENTS AT THE START BUT THEY TOOK NO ACTION.

THATTA BOY GIRL quickly took control, widened on the turn then remained safe while ridden out through the final furlong. BOW TOWN CAT pursued the
winner throughout and held on for the place. SPECIAL RISK lacked speed, advanced in the two path on the turn then showed some late energy. BESS
bothered soon after the start, saved ground and closed well. I'M THIRSTY raced near mid pack and lacked a solid rally. ABACO DREAM was urged close
up wide down the backstretch and retreated. TO THE FLAG came out after the start crowding a rival, saved ground and was no factor. LITTLE NECK
dropped back early and was never in contention. IMPERIAL LADY raced far behind throughout. SKOOKIE chased between rivals briefly then stopped
abruptly.

APPEALING FUTURE, racing in four path, rallied to the lead near sixteenth pole and drew off. FIX ME A SANDWICH set the pace just off the rail, resisted
when challenged but then weakened late. POPIZAR, racing in the four path, was never a serious threat. FAST RUNNER broke slowly and was outrun early,
was very wide into and through stretch. GET THE W saved ground and tired. ASPHALT PAVING had only brief speed.

slow, awkward start and then was outrun while he saved ground, split rivals on the final turn, moved out wider through stretch and was along for place.
PRINTER saved ground early then split foes, went three wide into stretch, took up chase but then flattened out. DRUMMER DON raced wide, flattened out
and was eased up late. SIGHT LINE saved ground dueling for the early lead then tired. BANKER'S ISLAND, between foes while well placed, tired. HIGH
FLYING GUY was three then two wide while just off the pace then gave way. REIGNING WARRIOR saved ground and tired. HOWBOUTDEMPATS dueled
