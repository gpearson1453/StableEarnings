NARROW ESCAPE forced the early pace, had a slim lead on the far turn and from the three path through the stretch was kept to task. CENAR was in
touch, a factor on the far turn and had a bid from the five path at the top of the stretch but was second best. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE was well back, saved
ground on the far turn and gained gradually through the stretch. WORLD OF PROSPECTS was in range and hustled along on the far turn but from the six
path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. MAGICAL BREEZE showed speed from the inside and dueled on the far turn but gave way at the top of the
stretch.

Footnotes
PASTEL EMILY set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch prevailed. MUNCH AND CRUNCH was off the
pace, gained ground on the far turn and from the five path through the stretch just missed. CLEARLY SEEN was well back, moved up on the far turn and
was up for show. MOON ROVER stalked the early leader but chased on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more.
CONQUEST RAPIDUNO was in range and hustled along on the far turn but had no rally. CALM IT was in touch and a factor on the far turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. LINDATALKS had no speed and showed nothing while outrun. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON
MUNCH AND CRUNCH AGAINST PASTEL EMILY FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RESULTED IN PASTEL EMILY BEING DISQUALIFIED AND
PLACED SECOND.

three path at the top of the stretch held show. EVER SO D'WILD showed speed from the outside and forced the pace on the turn but from the five path at
the top of the stretch was all out. ORPHAN QUEEN was in range and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch evened out.

Footnotes
KAIGUN was unhurried early, gained ground on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. EASY WEEKEND was
off the pace, roused on the far turn and angled out at the top of the stretch but just missed. AWESOME MINER set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on
the far turn but gave way in mid stretch. FOUR KNIGHTS was in range and hustled along on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch
needed more. CONQUEST ELIMINATR was in touch, raced evenly on the far turn and had to check from the three path at the top of the stretch while all
out. GREENFIELD had no speed and saved ground on the far turn but was no real threat. RED BO was well back and had a mild gain on the far turn but
from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no impact. CONSTANTINO forced the early pace and dueled on the far turn but from the four path at the
top of the stretch had nothing left. GIANT MINE was in mid pack but lost ground on the far turn and was empty. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON
CONQUEST ELIMINATR AGAINST EASY WEEKEND FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RESULTED IN EASY WEEKEND BEING DISQUALIFIED
AND PLACED FIFTH.

at the top of the stretch and held show. BLUE BELT was off the pace, gained ground on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no real
threat. DYNAMITE KARMA was away alertly and had a good position on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch weakened. UNYIELDING
was unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. TALE OF VIENNA was in touch but chased on the turn and dropped back through
