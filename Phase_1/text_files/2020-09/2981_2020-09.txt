Footnotes
SIERRA HOTEL, urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin to the far turn, widened when prompted nearing the
lane and held sway to the end under mild encouragement. BIG FALCON ROCKET, urged to a forward placing along the inside attending the pace, was
urged to advance racing into the lane but proved no match. WHATA PERFECT DAY was rated inside foes as part of the second flight to the backstretch,
was urged to advance despite close quarters nearing upper stretch, shifted three wide entering the lane and edged a rival for a share. WHERE'D THE DAY
GO shifted three wide early to track the leaders as part of the second flight, was prompted to advance on the far turn but had no closing bid. TALENT AND
TRICKS angled inwards to track the leaders between rivals in second flight, shifted inside racing into the lane and faded. WANNAPLAYBIGCHIEF was rated
off the second flight along the inside, was prompted to advance while shifting out after a half, was fanned four wide into the lane but had no rally. BYE BYE
BENNIE, caught a bit wide leaving the chute, settled while angling inwards and failed to menace. FLANAGAN, reserved last to the backstretch, failed to
menace. ROYAL EDITION tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch and retreated early.

Footnotes
RAGING GOLD DIGGER, bumped at the start, was reserved just off the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide midway through the
backstretch advancing to contention, continued in that path through the far turn, then dug in racing past the furlong marker to wrest the advantage in time
under firm handling. CARRIAGE was rated off the second flight racing to the first turn, steadily gained position three deep between foes nearing upper
stretch, wrested the advantage nearing the furlong marker but couldn't contain the winner. SILVERA, reserved along the inside in the opening stages,
switched outside foes nearing the far turn, angled five wide entering the lane and continued with some late interest to edge a rival for a share. FIRST
HUNTER, urged to the lead along the rail racing to the first turn, dueled with a rival through the backstretch into the far turn, edged forward nearing upper
stretch but gave out once headed nearing the furlong marker. GINGER ROSE, bumped at the start, angled to the rail tracking just off the leaders, continued
along the inside to upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. MEMORABLE ANGEL angled inwards to prompt a rival pace racing into the backstretch,
pressed the issue on the far turn to upper stretch and gave way. FRIENDLY AND KIND, forwardly placed between rivals tracking just off the leaders racing
to the far turn, gave way into the lane. STARFEST veered out at the start bumping GINGER ROSE and forcing that rival into the path of the eventual winner,
settled last along the inside and proved no threat.

Footnotes
STONE ARCH BRIDGE, in touch with the leaders between foes attending the pace in the opening quarter, took over racing through the turn to gain a clear
advantage nearing upper stretch and widened the margin under pressure. CHURCH SERVICE tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn,
split foes racing into upper stretch but proved only second best. TUFFENOUGHTOSTART, forwardly placed three wide prompting the pace racing through
the backstretch into the bend, drifted out nearing upper stretch and gave way. TOUGH BAMA BELLE tracked off the first flight racing off the rail into the turn
but never gained contention. MYSTIC COURT hopped at the start, was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin through the
backstretch and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CINCO STAR sped to the fore along the rail, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin to the far turn and responded to firm handling to widen the
advantage through the closing stages. TIN BADGE broke out brushing GIANT PAYDAY, was righted to track just off the pacesetter between foes, then
along the inside after a half, shifted out racing into the lane while being urged to challenge but proved no match. SKIPPY'S STRIKE, caught wide early,
tracked off the second flight into the backstretch, was prompted to advance while being fanned four wide into the lane and edged rivals for a share. KID
FROSTIE, shuffled back out of close quarters at the start, settled along the inside and continued with a steady effort to gain some position inside rivals in the
closing stages. GIANT PAYDAY, carried out a bit start, tracked the pacesetter as part of the second flight to the far turn, shifted three wide racing into upper
stretch and came up empty. NOBLE EGYPTIAN angled to the inside tracking just off the second flight in the opening half, angled out entering the lane but
had no rally. I'M AN EIGHT, reluctant to load in the starting gate, broke awkwardly and failed to menace.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT CURRENT, forwardly placed between rivals attending the pace racing into the turn, continued with a steady bid to wrest the advantage in upper
stretch and kicked away under firm encouragement. RUNAWAY READY, off a bit slowly, tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn,
shifted out entering the lane and bested the others. GABRIEL'S LEGEND tracked off the first flight between rivals racing into the turn, shifted three wide
nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid while edging a rival for a share. STEPPIN ON OUT was urged between foes to gain the advantage,
then angled inside setting the pace racing into the turn, briefly resisted the winner's challenge but gave way late. WITHHERBOOTSON tracked off the
second flight while angling to the inside and offered no rally. PASSTHECAT switched out four wide racing through the backstretch into the turn and never
gained contention. DRAKE'S SPIKED ICE, a bit reluctant to load, was urged to a forward placing four, then three wide racing to the turn and was finished
early.

Footnotes
SHABAM came through close quarters at the start to track off the first flight between foes under light rating, gained position between foes just off the inside
racing to the far turn, moved to challenge just outside the pacesetter racing into upper stretch, gained the lead, then swerved out under brisk left handed
pressure crossing into the path of RENTAL POOL in late stages but was righted to gain a clear advantage nearing the wire. The latter ducked out at the
start bumping ALL NATIVE and forcing that rival into DREAMING OF BLUE, was righted to gain a position in second flight, conceded some position nearing
the far turn under patient handling, shifted out four wide to advance between foes racing into the lane, then was forced out in late stages but recovered to
prevail for the place honors. MIZZANNA, forwardly placing tracking the pacesetter in the opening half, advanced to take over leaving the midway point of the
far turn, set the pace into the lane and faltered midstretch. AWESOME SUNSET settled outside foes in early stages, angled inwards entering the
backstretch to track between foes to the far turn, shifted inwards under pressure but improved position between foes to the end. AND ISLES tracked off the
second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, made brief progress three wide racing into the far turn but came up empty in the drive. DREAMING OF
BLUE, bumped, then shuffled back at the start, recovered to track off the second flight between foes, was fanned five wide nearing upper stretch, lacked a
late response and was vanned off the course following the race. IRISH HALO settled well off the leaders while angling inside, shifted out nearing the lane
and continued evenly between foes. TRENDY NEVE tracked just off the first flight along the inside in the opening half and steadily faded racing into the far
turn. ALL NATIVE, bumped soundly at the start, was settled between foes to the backstretch, swung six wide into the lane but offered no rally. LIL' RED
DEVIL settled outside foes to the backstretch and failed to menace. GOLDEN TAP settled between foes in early stages but proved no threat. ARRESTING,
urged to dictate the pace along the inside from the outset to the far turn, gave way nearing the lane. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF RENTAL
POOL LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SHABAM WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY INTO THE
START AND THE STRETCH RUN. AFTER REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SHABAM FOR INTERFERENCE,
PLACING HER SECOND.

was prompted to advance shifting out three wide entering the lane and took charge to go clear under firm encouragement. MR. D'S LEGEND tracked off the
first flight between foes in the opening quarter, switched outside foes entering the turn to advance four wide nearing upper stretch, couldn't match the winner
but edged a rival for the place honors. J J'S WILDCAT, urged to the lead racing in the three path early, dueled for command between foes into the turn and
gave way leaving midstretch. ITWASTHEDEVILSIDEA, slow to gather stride, angled to the rail early, then shifted out nearing the lane to improve position
between foes late. YESTERYEAR angled to the inside disputing the pace, dueled into upper stretch and gave way. CELTICS WILDCAT settled outside foes
early and never gained contention. ADDED DIAMONDS, caught five wide in early stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn and soon dropped out. R
DEJA VOO was rated along the inside and retreated early. BOOZIN AT BOZOS, urged to a forward placing four wide, then three wide racing into the turn,

Footnotes
LOVE MY BOSS, reserved while angling to the inside in the opening half, gained position inside foes racing into the far turn, swung out six wide in upper
stretch and continued with a steady late response to take over late under firm encouragement. HOMELAND MESSA tracked off the first flight along the
inside racing to the backstretch, was bumped by DRAMA IN DANUBE nearing the far turn, shifted out to bid three deep between foes nearing upper stretch,
gained a brief advantage but couldn't contain the winner. MARSHALL HILL settled well off the leaders along the inside in the opening half, swung out five
wide racing into the far turn, made a steady advance in that path to gain striking distance but was outkicked. SON OF POSEIDON, urged prompting a rival's
pace, pressed the issue through the backstretch into the far turn and gave way into the lane. DRAMA IN DANUBE, urged three deep between foes to gain a
position just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, shifted inwards bumping HOMELAND MESSA nearing the far turn and came up empty racing into
the lane. PLEASANT MOON, caught six wide racing into the first turn, tracked off the first flight outside foes for a half, was urged to advance lodging a brief
bid four wide nearing the lane but soon emptied out. DUSTY PRINCESS settled near the inside early and failed to menace. COURTING MOONLIGHT,
pinched back at the start, angled to the rail in early stages but never gained contention. CAMPAIGN SPY, urged four wide between foes to a position in the
second flight racing through the first turn, dropped out early. YOU SAY SO, urged along the rail disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way
into the lane. CLASSY INDIVIDUAL, caught five wide between foes racing into the first turn while jnder pressure to contend, dropped out early.

Footnotes
PUBLIC SAFETY, forwardly placed four wide tracking a rival's pace, was prompted to make a steady advance on that rival three deep leaving the turn,
wrested the advantage in upper stretch and went clear under hand urging. LIL' NINJA settled outside foes in early stages, then continued with a steady
effort five wide between foes on the turn into the stretch to gain the place honors late. SIOUX VALLEY settled between foes in the last flight early, lacked a
path from which to advance racing through the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and continued with interest between rivals to prevail for a share.
HENRY O'HENRY was urged to dictate the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail, went clear through the turn but gave out once headed by the
winner in upper stretch. GOPHER GOLD, a bit slow into stride, raced six wide into the turn and made some mild progress. DERBYS MONEYMAKER was
settled outside foes early, angled seven wide racing into the lane but made no impact. PHANTOM THREEONINE tracked off the first flight along the inside
racing through the backstretch but faded early. CIRCLE ME BERT, urged between foes prompting the pace, gave way early. WORN A BIT vied briefly three
wide between foes but emptied out racing into the turn.

Footnotes
OMEN OF CHANGE, urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch and
grudgingly maintained the advantage under right handed pressure. GOT EVEN SMARTER, reserved last while angling to the inside racing through the
backstretch, gained contention along the rail nearing upper stretch to bid inside the leader, raced in close quarters in late stages and proved only second
best. SPEEDING KID tracked just off the first flight in the opening stages, was prompted to bid three wide between foes racing into the turn and continued
willingly to late stages while just outkicked by the top pair. ATTAIN SUCCESS, bumped at the start, was prompted to position between foes, then settled off
the second flight, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. PROFESSIONAL broke outwards bumping ATTAIN SUCCESS,
was righted quickly to force the pace between foes racing into the turn and gave way midstretch. HARD TO PARK flashed brief pace between foes but
dropped out early. JUST BLAZE, off slowly, was urged to contend four wide racing to the turn and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
BOSS HUGO broke sharply, angled inwards to dictate the pace on a narrow margin between foes racing into the turn and edged clear late under firm
handling. AND HE'S LOOSE tracked off the first flight between foes in early stages, shifted out three wide while being urged prompting the pace into the
turn, pressed to upper stretch but proved no match late. ROCKTHEPULPIT angled to the inside disputing the pace inside the eventual winner, dueled into
the lane and weakened late. TWIRLINCOTTONCANDY angled to the rail in early stages tracking just off the first flight into the turn, shifted a bit off the
inside and continued evenly into the lane. IZZY IN A TIZZY threw his head at the start while dropping well back early, settled between foes and found his
best stride in the closing stages to gain position three deep between foes. SAMMY'S NUGGET tracked off the second flight along the inside but offered no
closing bid. WHISKYFORBREAKFAST tracked off the second flight racing four wide into the turn and lacked the needed late response. GONE A LIL LU HU,
urged to a forward placing five wide in the opening stages, tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight and faded nearing the lane. SHATTERED
DREAMS proved no factor. MONROES DREAM switched outside early and was soon outpaced. FIERCE HE BE dropped out early. NAZDRAVE was
outdistanced nearing the lane but walked off under his own power.
