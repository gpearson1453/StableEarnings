HELLO FRIENDS forced the pace, bid late turn, led at the top of the stretched and held under a drive. SOUPER PECAN raced in mid pack, came off the rail
late turn then rallied gamely. WIDE AWAKE, in range, closed two to four-wide through the turn, failed with a bid in the stretch, chased, but weakened late.
DEAR ONE pressed the pace from the rail, stalked on the turn, closed into the stretch, was up close but did not bid and evened out late. LA BESTIA set a
pressured pace, dueled into the stretch, was headed quickly and faded. OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY forced the issue, was hustled three to five-wide on the
turn but failed to menace. GRAZARION, in mid pack early, closed five then four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. THATS BOMB broke
outward and settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail through the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
RAPUNZEL'S DREAM showed brief speed then stalked the pace, closed two-wide late turn, rallied, led in the final furlong and held swayunder a hand ride.
STORMY VISION was rated off the pace, closed two to four-wide on the turn then rallied determinedly and was gaining late. GEA broke inward and was
rated off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, closed approaching the stretch and was gaining to the end. IVYLEA steadied at the start,
raced in mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn and finished all out. CHEEKY PINT broke outward, pressed the pace, forced the issue on
the turn, dueled into the stretch, gained the lead but was passed in the final furlong and gave way. BOATLOADOFNERVE was off slowly then rated off the
pace, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide through the turn, moved wider in the stretch and finished gamely. SARARENDA raced in mid pack,
came three-wide through the turn but evened out in the late stages. NOBLE GODDESS broke outward, set a pressured pace, dueled into the stretch, was
headed and faded. CHEEKYLICIOUS was herded outward leaving the gate, settled off the pace, raced three then two-wide on the turn but evened out in
the stretch. LIGHT IT UP was prominent early then stalked the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch but failed to menace.

Footnotes
PRICELESS WILL was off the pace early, advanced two wide between rivals on the turn and tipped out into the four path turning for home to take on the
leaders, drove to the front and lugged in at the eighth pole on his wrong lead, straightened out quickly to hold the lead but the damage was done. DIXIE
GIANT led quickly, was stalked down the backstretch, shook off that challenger by mid turn, had a clear advantage in upper stretch, lost the lead at the
eighth pole but battled on gamely to the wire. THERE'S NO JOE stalked the two leaders, stayed three wide on the turn and moved into a striking position
turning for home, steadied hard at the eighth pole when the winner shifted in, gathered up and re-rallied to just miss in a place photo with the early leader.
SEVENTH WONDER in mid pack between runners into the turn when grabbed up momentarily, resumed his run along the inside to get into contention in
mid stretch but levelled off in the final sixteenth. FIRST DESIRE was taken up just after the break, the rider steadying down the backstretch to be last,
rallying after tipping off the rail in upper stretch, showing good interest late. ORPHAN HALLIE sat along the inside behind the leaders, steadied hard into the
turn and dropped back to second last, re-rallying mildly down the stretch to pass a tired foe. BIRCHMOUNT RD stalked the early leader, pressed the pace
until midway on the turn and retreated from there. WHIZMO was off the pace and trying to rally when three wide on the turn but stalled midway on the bend
and had nothing left for the stretch. THE RIDER OF THE THIRD PLACE FINISHER THERE'S NO JOE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF THE WINNER PRICELESS WILL AT THE EIGHTH POLE. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED THE WINNER AND PLACED
HIM THIRD.

Footnotes
GRETZKY THE GREAT stalked the pace, came two-wide through the turn, closed into the stretch, took the lead, moved clear then came inward and
widened under a hand ride. READY TO REPEAT set a reserved pace along the rail, was collared and passed upper stretch, lost his path when ther winner
came in front of him, altered course and chased to the wire. DOLDER GRAND was away slowly and settled off the pace, closed three and four-wide on the
turn, bumped with AMERICAN MONARCH upper stretch then finished determinedly. AMERICAN MONARCH broke outward and settled in mid pack, closed
three-wide on the turn, bumped with DOLDER GRAND upper stretch and finished gamely in vain. HEAT OF THE NIGHT lost his path at the start and settled
in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide through the turn, angled out in the stretch and rallied. SECRET POTION, in range along the rail, angled out
chasing into the stretch, moved back to the rail in mid stretch then finished evenly. DOWNLOAD stumbled leaving the gate, raced off the pace, saved
ground on the turn, chased into the stretch but lost his path when SECRET POTION came back to the fence in mid stretch and evened out. A CLAIM
LODGED BY THE RIDER OF READY TO REPEAT AGAINST GRETZKY THE GREAT FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
LADY SPEIGHTSPEARE forced the pace, stalked the pace on the turn, closed approaching the stretch, swept to the lead mid stretch and held under a
drive. ALDA raced in mid pack, came three then two-wide on the turn, ducked out at the top of the stretch then rallied gamely. SEASONS, away slowly,
settled off the pace, swung out for the stretch drive and rallied mildly. DREAMING OF DREW stalked from the rail, was laying in on the improper lead until
the final 16th and finished gamely. SLEEK LYNX (GB), in range, came through the turn three then two-wide, bobbed in and out near the top of the stretch,
dropped back a little then rallied in vain. STUNNING PRINCESS closed to mid pack, saved ground on the turn then finished all out. BIG BIG PLANS broke
outward but led early, set the pace, quickened on the turn, gave way a furlong out and retreated.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S SOLUTION came up the inside of a rival to take the lead while under restraint, opened a clear advantage on the turn, repulsed a bid by the same
rival turning for home and kept giving to hold sway, drifting out a tad late. CHIRICAHUA SIGNAL leapt in the air at the break, advanced up the inside to mid
pack, angled out to the three path to sit outside the two leaders turning for home and was laying in a tad inside the final seventy yards, no match for the
winner. GUNNER BEN was outside in mid pack, came into range three to four wide on the turn, laying in somewhat in upper stretch, closing well when
straightened out in the final seventy yards. BADJEROS BOY stalked the winner throughout, bid at the top of the stretch but was repulsed by the winner,
holding on for a minor award. HEYDON'S CASE chased along the rail, was in behind the winner turning for home but was outkicked down the lane. R U
WATCHINGBUD settled off the pace and trailed into the turn, came three to four wide and out in the seven path at the top of the stretch, inching up widest
and levelling off the final forty yards. EPILOGUE off the pace and dropped back to trail midway on the turn, only able to pass a few tired foes in the stretch,
closing mildly. FOLLOW MY LEAD off the pace early before angling out two to four wide on the turn, out in the six path turning for home but not changing
leads through the stretch and tiring. PERLARANA sat in mid pack and along the fence on the turn, not responding when asked.
