Footnotes
GRUMPELSTILTSKIN accelerated to the front at the seven sixteenths pole and was rated through the backstretch, came under pressure at the rail midway
on the turn and was steadily encouraged down the lane. EUTAW STREET chased the early pace toward the outside and rounded the turn about the four
path, then dug in from the head of the lane and dueled for second the final sixteenth. GRAND FIBER gave chase and raced in the three path of the turn
then outfinished for second the final sixteenth. FREEDOM IS RINGING chased the leaders and raced at the rail on the turn, then flattened stride inside the
sixteenth pole. SCYTHE gave chase and saved ground on the turn. SAGEBRUSH had his head cocked to the inside when his stall door opened then leapt
from the gate and lost all chance.

Footnotes
BUFF N stalked the earlier pace two deep then took the lead past the three eighths pole, drew clear into the far turn and was steadily encouraged to widen.
WHOSE THAT LADY rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace leaving the turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole,
came through the far turn in the three path then dueled for second. SHOOFLY PIE raced in the five path on the turns, bid from the seven sixteenths pole
and was along for third later yards. BELLA FEMMINA angled to the inside to set the pace then came under pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole but dropped back into the far turn and flattened stride. KIM'S DIAMOND rounded the first turn in the five path then gave
chase from the three eighths pole, but flattened stride about the three path of the far turn. MASTERDANCER showed little response through the
backstretch. LADY SPARROW saved ground and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DUBAI WAS LIT raced well off the pace and left the second turn outside, bid past the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and
dueled to the lead in the upper stretch, then drew away later yards. CHINA CAT raced well back from early contention then bid approaching the five
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, angled to the outside leaving the turn and finished well to take second later yards while gaining on the
winner. SILK STOCKING checked from between horses into the first turn then settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid toward the seven
sixteenths pole and raced in range of the lead in the three path of the far turn, but, flattened stride through later yards. FLOATING BY steadied at the rail in
the vicinity of the seven eighths pole and settled off the pace while saving ground, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the
far turn then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. AZZURRA showed the way through the opening turn then dropped back from the seven eighths pole, bid
leaving the three eighths and took the lead toward the five sixteenths, dueled with the advantage through the far turn then weakened inside the sixteenth
pole. C R CASE'S LEGACY set the pace from the thirteen sixteenths pole but was caught toward the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail then
weakened from mid-stretch. HAY BABY GIRL raced with the early pace inside but dropped back approaching the three eighths pole, faded readily from that
point and was not encouraged the final quarter.

Footnotes
LIZA contested the pace inside and took the lead at the rail midway on the turn, dueled clear toward the head of the lane and held well under steady stretch
handling. TRINNI SUNSET gave chase outside and raced six wide on the turn, dueled for second inside the sixteenth pole and finished well. MANNA FROM
HANNAH gave chase toward the inside then eased to the five path approaching the head of the lane and was along to take third the final yards. HIDE gave
chase through the backstretch and raced near the rail on the turn, then flattened stride the final sixteenth. VEE TEE gave chase toward the inside, raced at
the rail on the turn and showed little more. RAE'SREDROCKET contested the pace two deep but dropped back midway on the turn and weakened.
ALLTINGZ R PAZIBLE broke inward across the path of EXCLUSIVELY MIA and dropped well back; the latter of whom was pinched back leaving the gate,
picked up the chase outside and rounded the turn about the seven path. CHASING MIDNIGHT raced well back saving ground.

more. CREEKMORE rated off the pace about the three path then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, was carried to the six path approaching

Footnotes
BOASTER settled off the pace about the three path the opening turn then bid approaching the three eighths pole, took the lead in the four path approaching
the head of the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. AWSOME FAITH raced off the early pace in the three and four paths, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn mostly in the four path, but swung to the six path entering the stretch and dug in to earn the nod for second the final
yards. BUFF'S EYE VIEW settled off the pace in the three path, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and raced three wide on the far turn then
outfinished for second through the final yards. OPERA NITE took the lead approaching the three quarter pole and rated the pace inside, came under
pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail to the mid point of the far turn but was caught past the three sixteenths pole
and flattened stride later yards. PARTY LIFE bore outward into the first turn then corrected course to stalk the pace two deep, challenged toward the five
sixteenths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage still two deep on the far turn but dropped back into the lane and flattened stride the final sixteenth. STEP
OUT DANCING raced well back while saving early ground, bid toward the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, angled to the
outside entering the stretch and showed little more. START LINE saved ground off the pace, showed little response through the backstretch then faded at
the rail on the far turn. CASTLE BOUND raced well off the pace in the three and four paths and was through early. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
LIZZIE'S LAST angled in to stalk the early pace two deep then moved to even terms toward the seven sixteenths pole, dueled from the three eighths to take
the advantage nearing the quarter, drew clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. UNCUT settled close while saving ground
the first turn then bid leaving the three eighths pole, took aim in the four path toward the head of the lane and finished evenly. POSTINO'S QUEST rounded
the first turn about the four path and settled off the pace leaving the turn, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the
four path then dueled to take third mid-stretch. CALCUTTA saved ground off the pace the first turn then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, raced two deep on the far turn but flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. WE LOVE NANNI angled to the inside to rate a slim lead, was met at even
terms at the nine sixteenths pole and pressured to duel from the seven sixteenths, but, dropped back toward the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn
then weakened. A FOOLISH SMILE showed little response after saving early ground. YODEL LADY settled close in the three path the first turn then gave
chase toward the three eighths pole, though, faded on the far turn. GRAND BLUE HARBOR raced off the pace while saving early ground, showed little
response through the backstretch and rounded the far turn in the five and six paths.
