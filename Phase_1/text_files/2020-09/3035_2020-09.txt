Footnotes
DIRT ROAD RED never far back inside to the second turn, remained inside to the stretch then angled out for room in mid stretch, rallied once clear and
closed fast to prevail. MAXINAMILLION contested the pace two wide to t he stretch, battled gamely through a long drive but was tagged late for the win
while besting MOONLIGHT BLUE for second. MOONLIGHT BLUE stalked the pace to the backstretch, pushed up inside to duel from the rail to the stretch,
dug in determinedly to deep stretch then was outfinished. EL BORRACHO trailed to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch then lacked the needed
late response. MR. MAGICO also was stalking to the half, raced three wide on the second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch then finished evenly. REY
COLIMAN was on the pace to the backstretch then dropped back and chased to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch and also failed to advance in
the drive. ALLEYCAT was settled for a half mile, got fanned four wide to the stretch and came up empty in the final furlong.

Footnotes

urging. CONCENSUS pressed the pace three wide to the stretch, got outkicked by the winner to mid stretch but kept to task to save the place. TRIBAL
STORM was slow to settle then pushed up in side to get into contention, saved ground to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch then was outfinished for
second. WHOA BUDDY got outsprinted to the turn, came two wide to the stretch, made a bid to mid stretch then could not sustain the needed response.
HOT ENCOUNTER tracked the pace to the turn but had to circle four wide to the stretch, was outrun to mid stretch by the winner and did not rally.
ELEGANT TANNER chased the pace three wide, swung out widest for the drive but weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BIG DUKE stalked the leaders between rivals to the turn, was two wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms with RANTANEN leaving mid stretch and
outdueled that one late. RANTANEN pressed the pace two wide, responded to take over into the stretch then battled the winner to deep stretch but was
bested. SEA SAILOR broke about five lengths last, trailed to the turn, was off the rail to the stretch while edging closer then angled out in mid stretch but
finished evenly. WARRIORS HERO chased the pace from the rail to the stretch, shifted off the rail for the drive but came up empty. A LITTLE BIT LUCKY
stalked the pace also three wide to the stretch but was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. FALCONS FURY got outsprinted to the turn, was forced to
circle four wide to the stretch then weakened in the lane. THEYREMINISCEOVERU hustled along and set the pace from the rail to the stretch then was
overtaken and tired.

Footnotes
WHERE'S FRANKIE had good speed from the inside, dueled from the rail to the stretch then inched away to mid stretch and held on stubbornly. B J'S
SPIRIT attended the pace outside the winner to the stretch, lugged inward and cut off TESS'S WILD CAT leaving the furlong grounds then lugged out while
racing erratically to the line. TESS'S WILD CAT chased the leaders from the rail to the stretch, shifted out to try to rally in the spot B J'S SPIRIT left in mid
stretch but was cut off when that one lugged inward, steadied and finished evenly. WINNING APPEAL chased the pace to the turn, was three wide to the
stretch then closed a bit without threatening late. TURA LURA broke slow and was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch and was finishing well
inside. SILVER LYRIC got outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. MARVELOUS MARVELLA
broke slow and lagged to the turn, was two wide then shifted out for room and also finished with interest late. MARK WHATS MINE had no speed, raced two
wide to the stretch but could not threaten. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run involving B J's Spirit and Tess's Wild Cat and disqualified
B J's Spirit from second to third for intereference.

T BONES TRICK was allowed to settle to the second turn, rallied three then four wide to the stretch, continued to respond when set down and closed fast to
get a desperate nod. PROSPICIENCE broke slow and trailed to the stretch while two wide, angled out for room then closed fast late but missed. BOYSON
had no speed, settled to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch but was rallying through the final furlong. DARKHAWK never far back to the
half, was two then three wide to the stretch, responded when asked in the drive and just missed. LOOK AT MY HOOVES pressed the pace to the second
turn, bid two wide to the stretch, took over in mid stretch, dug in but was outfinished. POUR ON THE COLE tracked the pace to the second turn, saved
ground and rallied to loom boldly in mid stretch but was outkicked late. MAJOR KONG got outsprinted to the half, was two wide to the stretch but could not
make an impact in the late stages. SINGLE BARREL set the pace to the half then was under urging on the second turn and tired in the drive.

settled to the second turn, circled five wide to the stretch then outfinished the rest. QUAZE VIPER settled mid pack to the half, was four wide on the second
turn, swung out widest for the drive but did not threaten. CHASE AND COLORADO was also settled for a half mile, raced three wide to the stretch but was
never a serious factor. BIGFOOT CITY pressed the pace two wide to the stretch then got outkicked and weakened. RIVER NORTH set the pace for six
furlongs, was overtaken into the stretch and tired. MY LUCKY BID raced mid pack to the half, was off the rail to the stretch then weakened.

chased the pace to the half then gave way. FLYING PETER PAN was pinched back a bit at the start and not a factor.

Footnotes
MY FRIEND TONY stalked the pace from the rail to the stretch, angled out nearing mid stretch and briefly took the path of EMERALD MAGIC, rallied once
clear and was up in time. DETANGLER got outsprinted to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch and closed willingly. FLICFLAC broke slow and
had no speed, saved ground to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch then was outfinished. PAPAPIFAS hustled to contest the pace, saved ground to
the stretch, stayed to mid stretch then was tiring. SNOW FEATHER attended the pace two wide to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then was outkicked.
HECK YEAH had no speed, circled four then five wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. EMERALD MAGIC tracked the pace two wide to
the stretch then was tiring and had to check away from the winner in mid stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
MY FATHER FOOTSTEP was quickest and edged away to the backstretch, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded late to hold. MR.
PICKLES chased the winner to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch then finished willingly. FATHER O'FLAHERTY had no speed, settled for a half
mile, saved ground on the second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task to the line. QUE SERA SIR RALPH was four wide to the backstretch,
tracked to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch and also made up some ground late. BLAKEFORD pressed the winner to the second turn, was
outkicked three wide to the stretch and closed the gap without threatening. MISTY CAT hesitated and broke slow, was four wide throughout and not a factor.
YNOT TONY settled mid pack to the half, was two wide to the stretch then gave way. BIG IRISH EYES had no speed.

short lead a sixteenth out but could not stall the winner. GEM STATE set the pace for six furlongs, responded to pressure to the stretch, resisted to deep
stretch then was outfinished. CURRY NATION broke slow and trailed to the second turn, circled four then five wide to the stretch, was widest in the drive
and closed willingly. PEGASUS SPRINT pressed the pace while in the two path to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.
