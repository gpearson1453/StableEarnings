Footnotes
THE MIGHTY JUDGE stalked two wide, tracked the leaders on the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, dueled with HONEY DONT in the final furlong
and wore down that rival to prevail. HONEY DONT pulled and was steadied racing close up in the early stages, then went three wide on the first turn,
stalked two wide, bid entering the far turn, dueled, took over, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and yielded. AFFLUENTIAL trailed the field, moved up at the
quarter pole, angled out, rallied late outside and got up for third. CHEYENNE BULL raced off the pace, advanced on the far turn, split rivals at the sixteenth
marker and rallied mildly inside. DARK ROAST pulled and was steadied early, then checked entering the first turn, settled off the pace, saved ground on the
far turn and raced between rivals in the stretch. BOB IN OUR MIDST had a three wide trip racing off the pace and failed to threaten. SUMMER MISCHIEF
set the pace, dueled on the far turn and tired. DISCREET HEAT pulled and was steadied early, then tracked inside and gave way.

Footnotes
ASHLEY'S HOPE was bumped at the start, raced two wide off the pace, rallied two wide on the far turn, gained command in midstretch and drew clear
under urging. ALLERIA raced three wide on the first turn, stalked three wide, bid three wide nearing the three eighths marker, took over, kicked clear, dug in
and then was no match for the winner. SYZYGY tracked inside, was shuffled back nearing the far turn, advanced on the turn and rallied mildly outside.
LAYLA'S VOYAGE raced off the pace inside, then between rivals, came three wide into the lane and weakened. SHERRY ORIENTAL stalked between
rivals and faded. LADY JOANNA was bumped at the start, set the pace on the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
MONTELEONE broke awkwardly and was off last, then rushed up inside into contention, bid three wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside in the stretch,
then wore down SAUCY DON in the final sixteenth for the win. SAUCY DON dueled two wide for the lead, led into the lane, edged away, dug in gamely
when challenged and yielded grudgingly. EIGHTS AND ACES chased three wide, raced inside into the lane and rallied mildly for third. KING DUDE OF
OCALA chased between rivals, came three wide into the lane and was outkicked for third. SILVER STARSHIP chased outside and closed belatedly outside
in deep stretch. JERSEY JOE B dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and tired. ALWAYS FREE raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten.
CLEAR PROSPERITY was outrun. BLINDED VISION chased three wide, gave way, was eased in deep stretch and vanned off.

Footnotes
LIKE WHAT I SEE showed good speed to vie for the early lead, cleared off soon after, responded when roused entering the stretch, shook free, then dug in
gamely late to hold on. OAK BLUFFS raced off the pace outside a rival, came three wide into the lane, closed well outside and dug in gamely to the finish.
QUIBERON BAY chased three wide, made a bid at the quarter pole, was outkicked in the final furlong, then drifted in late crowding LUCKY JAIME. ROYAL
URN was off slowly, raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane and closed well late. LUCKY JAIME vied early, then chased inside, raced on
the rail in the stretch, weakened, was crowded late and steadied nearing the finish. SAND DUNE raced off the pace inside, angled out at the top of the lane
and had no rally. REGALLY IRISH did not factor. PIANZI raced off the pace, two wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane and tired. A Jockey's
Objection by the rider of LUCKY JAIME against the third place finisher was dismissed.

CAUSE I SAID SO settled off the early lead, moved up on the turn, came three wide into the lane, closed strongly outside, ran past MOJAC KAT and pulled
away late. MOJAC KAT away alertly for the early edge, then dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, shook free entering the stretch, dug in gamely
but was no match for the winner. WILDCAT CURA raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the turn and rallied late on the rail for third. GIANT OF
GIANTS chased three wide, came four wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside and missed for third. ABAZILLION rushed up early to contest the pace,
dueled two wide for the lead, dueled on the turn and weakened late. SIR THADDEUS raced off the pace between rivals, came four wide into the lane and
lacked a rally. GOLDEN VIPER bobbled at the break, raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. CALEB THE BOSS raced three wide off the pace,
came four wide into the lane and did not factor. LONG ISLAND CITY stumbled badly at the start, raced four wide and was outrun.

lane and rallied mildly for third. HOLY GUACAMOLE raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the far turn, swung four wide turning for home and bested
the others. I RECKON SO broke in bumping a rival at the start, raced three wide early, stalked two wide, bid three wide nearing the far turn and weakened.
