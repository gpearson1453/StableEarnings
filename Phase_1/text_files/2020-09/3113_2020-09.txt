Footnotes
WICKED FORTITUDE pressed the pace three wide entering the backstretch and in the run to the final turn, rallied smartly while battling for the lead two
wide through the final turn, got the better of his pace rival late and inched clear. THE CHANCES R away alertly and dueled for the lead from between rivals
entering the backstretch, rallied determinedly from along the rail entering the final turn, and just failed to last, while proving easily second best. YOU DON'T
OWN ME settled off the early leaders while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied four wide through the final turn, and finished three
out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. RED BUFFALO broke sharply, but was taken in hand and trailed the field into the backstretch while saving
ground at the rail, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, tipped two wide entering the lane, and finished with some late interest.
DAT DAY away well and vied fort he lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail entering the backstretch,
struggled to keep pace with the leaders approaching the final turn, and had little to offer late.

Footnotes
UNCHARACTERISTIC broke sharply and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the turn, and repelled the late challenge by RICHARDS
COMMAND to prove best. RICHARDS COMMAND broke inwards, hitting the side of the gate, chased the leaders while saving ground along the inside
entering the turn, tipped three wide leaving the turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. SOUTHERN
LASS away well and chased the leader through the turn while saving ground at the rail, but lacked a closing response in the drive. TUXEDO away alertly
and chased the leaders three wide through the turn, and finished evenly two out from the rail in the drive. CALAMAZEUS chased the field from mid pack
while saving ground at the rail through the turn, and finished evenly two wide in the drive. DIVALDO was slow into stride and squeezed slightly in the
opening strides, trailed the field in the run to the turn, raced two wide throughout, and was never a factor. MANDY MAGIC was slow into stride and raced
three wide through the turn at the back of the pack, and showed little.

the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on the leader entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

ZEN BABY away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, dictated the pace from along the inside in the run down
the backstretch and through the final turn, and widened her margin late under confident handling. PEPPERMINT tracked the leader through the stretch the
first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished from
along the rail in the stretch drive to prove clearly second best. HEREVERYWISH settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the lane
the first time, tipped three wide entering the backstretch and raced into a stalking position, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished one out from
the rail in the drive to hold on for a share. TIMELESS SHRUG stalked the early leaders while racing two wide through the stretch the first time, rallied one
out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive. RUGGED BEAUTY was bumped at the start and trailed the field through the lane
the first time, rallied three wide from the back of the pack entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive. FOREVER CRYSTAL away
well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied two wide entering the final turn,
but failed to respond when called upon. ASPIRED broke sharply and tracked the leaders from along the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied along
the inside entering the final turn, and faded in the late stages.
