Footnotes
SHASTA STAR dueled for the lead outside of DOMONETTE into the turn, then inside of LOVE MY HONEY around it, dug in as JUNGLE JUICE (IRE)
produced a bid in upper stretch, repelled that foe at the furlong pole, and was ridden out to the wire. JUNGLE JUICE (IRE) stalked the pace two wide, split
the leaders to produce a three wide bid between horses at the quarter pole, but was repelled by the leader at the furlong pole, and proved second best.
DOMONETTE dueled for the lead along the inside into the turn, stalked from the pocket around the bend before attempting another bid for the lead along
the rail at the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with outer foes in upper stretch, then held show. I DREAM OF LOIS raced far off of the pace two wide,
swung six wide turning for home, and produced a mild kick for a minor reward. SANTINO was bumped by an inner foe at the start, lied close to the pace
three to four wide around the turn before being fanned five wide in upper strtech, but failed to produce a bid before being outfinished for minor rewards.
ANSWER MY CALL raced off of the pace three to four wide, but chased the leaders home without making a bid. SILENT SURPRISE saved ground from
midpack, but to no avail. LOVE MY HONEY broke out, prompted the pace three wide, dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner at the half mile
pole, but weakened four wide passing the quarter pole. FLAT MEADOW trailed a bit keenly along the inside into the turn, swung to the seven path turning
for home, but failed to factor. SWEET N WICKED was forwardly placed two wide early on, but steadily faded around the turn. ADAMANT was bumped at the
start, took the turn off of the pace in the two path, but failed to factor.

foes, then held ALIEN SEASON at bay in the final sixteenth. ALIEN SEASON shifted off of the inside to the four path around the turn, then rallied five wide
through the lane, but was denied by RANSACK through the late stages. TESTY KITTEN stalked the pace along from the pocket and behind the dueling
leaders, shifted three wide turning for home and produced a bid between horses approaching the furlong pole, dueled inside of RANSACK passing that
marker, but yielded in the late stages. VICTORY ELEMENT stumbled start, dueled for the lead two wide, but tired while hanging on her left lead through the
final furlong. CROCE D'ORO stalked the pace two to three wide around the turn before shifting four wide in upper stretch, but was outkicked by outer foes.
EL RUBIO tracked from midpack in the two path, and finished up evenly. CLEAR FOR ACTION dueled for the lead along the inside, but weakened passing
the furlong pole. BIG IRON saved ground far off of the pace, but failed to make an impact. CARTER CAT was outrun. TWINKLING KNIGHT was rank at the

UNMOORED sped clear early on, held his margin through upper stretch, then dug in gamely inside of ARTIE'S RUMOR at the furlong pole, and prevailed
via a headbob. ARTIE'S RUMOR settled off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide turning for home, rallied through the lane to produce a bid outside of
UNMOORED, but was denied by that foe and lost the headbob at the wire. SECRETARY AT WAR was forwardly placed three wide, inched closer to the
clear leader in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong pole, then weakened while hanging on his left lead. KREWE CHIEF saved
ground in midpack before splitting foes three wide in upper stretch, but chased the leaders evenly through the lane. CUESTION DE TIEMPO failed to factor.
CLINT MAROON (GB) stalked two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader at the quarter pole, and weakened. CROSSTOWN SHOOTOUT trailed the
field by a distance early on, and was outrun. AFLEET ASCENT stalked the pace along the inside, but weakened in upper stretch before being eased in the
late stages.

Footnotes
SUMMER IN SARATOGA raced far off of the pace three wide, swung five wide turning for home, rallied outside of foes to bid in the final furlong, shifted in
through the late stages herding her inner foe inwards, and prevailed. SORRENTINA LEMON tracked from midpack two wide, shifted out three then four
wide in upper stretch as OFFSPRING drifted out, rallied inside of SUMMER IN SARATOGA through the lane to bid inside the furlong pole, but was herded
in by that foe through the late stages, and lost the photo finish to that rival. JOY OF TREASURE raced far off of the pace four to three wide, then rallied
between horses through the lane, but was no match for her outer counterparts in the final furlong. TIZAHRA saved ground off of the pace while only leaving
the fence to pass a tiring foe, and produced a mild rally along the rail through the lane. OFFSPRING prompted the pace two wide, but driftd outwards in
upper stretch while failing to keep pace with the inner leader, then weakened further at the furlong pole. SOLD IT set the pace along the inside, drew clear in
upper stretch, but hit a wall in the final furlong, was swallowed up at the sixteenth pole, and stopped through the late stages. WILDLIFE trailed along the
inside early on, and was no factor. HIGH ROAD stalked the pace along the inside, but weakened turning for home. TWEETY SHOW was outrun.

LOGICAL MYTH rated in the pocket around the turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch but waited behind traffic, split foes at the furlong pole to
produce a bid, surged forward, then held. CHOCOLATE BAR was squeezed back at the start, trailed the field around the turn before swinging seven wide
turning for home, rallied stoutly outside of foes through the lane to bid at the sixteenth pole, but was denied by an inner rival. LAKE NAKURU was bumped
at the start, tracked from midpack four wide around the turn before producing a bid a the quarter pole, but was outkicked by an inner and an outer foe in the
final furlong. MANTRA was bumped hard by an outer foe at the start, raced far off of the pace two wide, shifted four to five wide in upper stretch to produce
a bid, but failed to keep pace with rivals at the furlong pole. REPROBATE tracked from far off of the pace in the five path around the turn, shifted six wide
turning for home, and produced a mild kick while hanging on his left lead. JUSTINTHENICKOTIME dueled for the lead two wide, then between horses
around the turn, but yielded at the furlong pole. AFICIONADO bumped an inner foe at the start, stalked two wide before attempting to bid between horses in
upper stretch, but tired. CHA VEZ was forwardly placed three wide and between horses, but weakened. PICASSO vied three wide around the turn, but
weakened in upper stretch. BEE CATCHER saved ground, but failed to factor. JUMPER was jostled at the start, saved ground in midpack, but failed to
make an impact. SUBSTANTIAL dueled for the lead inside of foes around the turn, but weakened at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
CONFESSING raced back early on, was in the six path into the lane, rallied down the lane, was rolling and drove past the leaders three wide, drew away in
the final stages while geared down to the wire. OSAKA GIRL chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid nearing the quarter pole,
edged past the leader and inched clear but was no match for the winner in the final stages. STREET OF DREAMS set the pace early, raced off the rail into
the lane, was overtaken near the quarter pole and faltered late in the drive. DEVIOUS CHARM raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane, made
a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. FATE FACTOR chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and leveled off late in the
stretch run. HEAVENLY PEACE was unhurried early on, raced off the rail into the lane, made a bid near the five sixteenths pole but weakened late in the
drive. LOVE BEACH tracked the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and faded down the lane. ELKE DO JAGUARETE (BRZ) was never a threat.
BETTER BIZ was never a factor. CHOATE BRIDGE stalked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane and empty late in the stretch drive. ENVIED
was through after a half.
