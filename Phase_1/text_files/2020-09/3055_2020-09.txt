Footnotes
SIGRID'S GOLD was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker, was well rated
through the back-stretch, remained in control through mid-stretch and held by a diminishing margin. URBAN DIVA stalked the winner while racing five-wide,
responded when set down for the drive and was gaining on the winner late to just miss. FULL SPEED AHEAD was forwardly placed from the inside
throughout and lacked the needed closing response. SHELBY R. steadied soon after the start, lagged early, raced three-wide through the second turn and
was not a factor. FORTY KNOT CURRENT pressed the pace of the winner for five furlongs, weakened and was eased through the lane.

TIZ BRILLIANT was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, responded to steady urging and wore down PURELY
POLITICAL in the closing yards to be going away late. PURELY POLITICAL raced unhurried early, moved four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter,
gained a slight advantage with a furlong to run but could not resist the winner late. I WORK FOR CARROTS broke sharply to set a pressured pace from off
the rail and gave way through the final furlong. PREACHINATDINNER was forwardly placed from between foes early, moved three-wide through the second
turn, angled in with a furlong to run and weakened in the drive. ONLY THE HIGH ROAD raced four-wide through the first turn then was never far back,
raced five-wide through the second turn and weakened. CODE GRAY was away in good order to press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened
after going five furlongs.

LITTLE DANCER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, offered a bid in mid-stretch, vied with SHE BEGAN
AGAIN late and got the nod. SHE BEGAN AGAIN settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out with a furlong to run, vied with the winner late and just
missed. CLASSIC LEAH broke sharply to set a pressured pace from off the rail and gave way through the final furlong. IF YOU WANT IT lagged early,
raced three-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. LOOKOUT TAYLOR raced five-wide through the first turn, lacked early speed,
raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. BEAU ROCKET was away alertly to press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened

FANTASTIC DAY raced unhurried early, circled six-wide through the turn and was up in the closing yards. SPITTIN IMAGE was away in good order to set a
pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin into the lane and gave way grudgingly to the winner late. VINNY FROM DIXIE was reserved just off
the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch and back inside with a furlong to run and finished willingly. LOLO PANIOLO settled off the
leaders from between foes, steadied nearing the three-eighths marker, angled inside nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly late. HARBORS
RULE was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. WICKED WINNINGS pressed the pace while racing
three-wide for a half and weakened.

Footnotes
STAY IN GRACE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, responded when challenged by SPOT ON nearing the quarter, vied with
that rival and edged clear through the final yards. SPOT ON broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to engage
nearing the quarter, vied but could not match strides late. MAGICAL SPELL lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the
stretch and finished with good late energy. CLOSE THE SHOW LO was off a step slow and bumped, rushed to contend, chased the leaders while racing
four-wide and gradually gave way. SUDDENLY AWESOME settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to rally. CASINO GAMES showed
no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. PERFECT BLOSSOM was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn
and weakened.

Footnotes
LOBANESS sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. TIGER ON YOUR SIX
chased the winner while racing three-wide, failed to gain on that rival in the drive but finished well to save the place. MIKE OPERATOR settled off the
leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. AZADI was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and
lacked the needed closing response. RI' PIN SNAP was void of early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TRIBAL IMPACT steadied
soon after the start, raced off the rail through the turn and was not urged in the drive. LOOK AT MY STAR lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn
and did not threaten. ROB'S GOT GAME was away in good order to press the pace from the inside for the opening quarter and weakened.
