Footnotes
WONDER BLONDY gave a prompted middle move looming off hard used rivals on the far turn surging to lead from between the pair in upper stretch
drawing out along the inside as much the best. STARS IN THE SKY (GB) bumped at the break was hustled to draw even on the backside chasing through
the turn, overpowered in upper stretch would salvage place in the four path. VINTAGE READY sent clear set the pace coming under pressure on the
backside, worked to daylight on the far turn, then weakened along the inside down the stretch. ABILIFY came out bumping at the break, raced a step slow
through the turn giving a modest rally from mid track down the lane. MY SWEET PAYNTER tracked the early pace then faded on the far turn. ORBITAL

Footnotes
CUTTIN EDGE TECH broke sharply to clear maintaining a comfortable margin throughout. TOWN CHAMP a step slow from the gate responded at mid
track to save place in the last strides. RULING chased gamely from the rail. SHADOW SURPRISE chased gamely throughout. ROMAN OFFICER a step
slow at the outset was no factor. APPEALING YANKEE moved evenly fading late. ROUXHERE off to a slow start would trail.
