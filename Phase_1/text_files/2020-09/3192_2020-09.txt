HOW SWEEP IT IS went evenly bidding three deep near the quarter pole powering clear in upper stretch widening in the three path as much the best.
VERY BOISTEROUS slow early circled out to upper stretch rallying six wide coming on to save place. BRENDA'S G L P rallied four wide on the turn vying
from mid track in upper stretch losing momentum giving an even finish. CYCLONE BETTY pressed early dueling along the inside through the turn wearing
out at the rail in upper stretch. DAVE'S TEXAS LADY sent hard pressured abreast then between foes on the turn wilting in the two path upper stretch.

LET ME ASK BOB broke sharply pressing to daylight along the inside on the turn, digging in from the two path down the lane found more holding rivals at
bay. TRUFFLES AND GOLD tracked the pace angling five wide into upper stretch unable to get to the winner while salvaging place at mid track.
FORCEFUL ONE rushed up to threaten on the turn extending outside the leader in the three and four paths down the lane weakening late. RUN FOR CASH
faded on the turn then showed some late interest in the three path. PRIME TIME slow early lost ground to upper stretch finishing evenly seven wide. BOSS
ONTHE HORIZON pressed early then gave way from the quarter pole. LIL DEUCE COOP folded up on the turn.
