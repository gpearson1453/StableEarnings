Footnotes
OIL ON CANVAS angled in approaching the first turn to race a bit off the rail in the second flight, gained inside entering the far turn, tipped two wide near the
three-eighths pole, seized command near the quarter pole, burst clear while lugging in on the left lead, drifted out under some left-handed urging in upper
stretch and widened while continuing greenly under a tight hold of the right rein. SUNNY ONE was bumped at the start, raced in range four wide around
both turns and finished willingly to gain the place. SOCIAL was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide, made good progress at the rail rounding
the far turn and rallied for the show. FEYRE set the pace along the rail to the quarter pole and weakened. AIR FORCE PINK raced off the pace inside,
swung seven wide in upper stretch and finished with interest. PRAY FOR RAIN was not a threat while racing two wide. BLAZE FINERY played no factor
while racing three and four wide. ONE SMART COOKIE chased the pace three wide and retreated around the far turn. STORYBOOK FARM lagged well
back inside, was ridden along four wide around the far turn and made little impact. JOY IN JERUSALEM was outrun while racing two wide. VERBIEN O. P.
had early speed two wide and stopped.

Footnotes
SQUAN'S KINGDOM stalked the pace three wide, seized command leaving the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, lugged in leaving the
three-sixteenths pole and held clear at the rail under left-handed urging. DR. ANN set the pace in the two path, could not match strides with the winner from
the quarter pole to the three-sixteenths pole but stayed on well to hold second. RAG TOP raced off the pace three wide and rallied through the lane.
PRINCESS PALOMAR went evenly while racing two wide. QUEEN OF MUSKOKA played no factor while racing three and four wide. BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN
saved ground and was done after a half.

Footnotes
GIULIA AMMANNATI set the pace along the rail, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. MARYLAND'S MIRACLE stalked the pace from
the rail, tipped out in upper stretch, could not keep pace with the winner but stayed on willingly to save the place. SMART RED lacked early speed while
saving ground, advanced along the rail around the far turn, stayed inside through the lane and just missed second. LOVELY BROWN stalked the pace two
wide, bid between rivals midway around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. KONSTANTINOVA failed to menace while racing two and three wide.
TWEETY KITTEN lacked early speed inside, swung out nearing the lane and never threatened. MAGICGIRL played no factor while racing four wide.
ANOTHER WHIM trailed in the three path, swung eight wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally. DOUBLE DOWN DARE was outrun inside. BELLA
GIANNA had early speed three wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
VOILA BABY stalked the pace three wide, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. RAPIDASHQUEEN stalked the pace
two wide, bid between rivals nearing the five-sixteenths pole, could not match strides with the winner but stayed on to be a clear second. EMBRACE A NEW
DAY raced off the pace outside, was bumped entering the turn, raced three wide around the bend and was along for the show. MOON OVER VICTORIA
had early speed inside then steadily faded. AWESOME PAL saved ground, bumped foes entering the turn, and lacked a closing bid. NO CON TESTA raced
off the pace between rivals, was bumped between foes entering the turn, raced two wide around the bend, angled widest in upper stretch and lacked a rally.
TAP THAT CAT trailed throughout.
