Footnotes
ELUSIVE FORCE was pushed along to the lead, set a pressured pace on the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, cleared into the lane, increased
his advantage under a drive, and held safe to the wire. ROSKI chased three wide on the backstretch and two wide on the turn, swung four wide into the
lane, began to improve position in upper stretch, and gained on the leader late. KYZAN pressed the pace four wide down the backstretch, was pushed along
between horses into the turn, vied between ELUSIVE FORCE and DRAMA STAR past the three eighths, came into the lane under a drive between horses,
could not match ELUSIVE FORCE, but chased on willingly. STORMINSIDE bobbled at the start, settled at the rear of the main group, trailed the main group
four wide on the turn, was taken five wide into the lane, and passed tired horses. DRAMA STAR pressed the pace five wide early, continued to vie three
wide on the turn, could not match ELUSIVE FORCE into the lane, and weakened under a drive. RIPE ATTACK settled second last in the main group, saved
ground through the turn, came into the lane in range behind the leader, and came up empty inside horses in the lane. MUTAKDDIM ROAD reared as the
gates opened, dwelt briefly after he got back on his feet, left the gate, and trailed all the way around.

WICKED SPIRIT came out in the opening strides and bumped PROMISES KEPT, chased inside LOCASH early, improved in the three to four path on the
turn, swung four wide into the lane, rallied under a drive and got up in the final fifty yards. DULCIMER DAME raced at the outside of the leading line early,
came in approaching the half mile mark, edged to a narrow lead between into the turn, continued to set the pace between horses into the lane, drove clear
in upper stretch, kept on well but was caught late. POLLY WAR CRY was taken back in the opening strides, settled near the rear, raced in the rear group in
the three path on the turn, was pushed along to take closer order past the three eighths, came two wide into the lane, rallied, showed good interest to the
end but proved no match for the leading pair. LAURA ATTACK raced four wide in the leading line early, tracked three wide on the turn, raced in range three
wide to the stretch, could not match DULCIMER DAME into the lane and lacked the needed kick in the final furlong. MARY'S A JEM raced in range early,
took back approaching the half mile mark when DULCIMER DAME came in, raced in the four to five path with the rear group on the turn, floated into the five
to six path into the lane, and passed tired horses four wide late. LOCASH chased outside of WICKED SPIRIT early, was pushed along in the three path on
the turn, came into the lane under a drive inside, and lacked the needed rally. ASHLEYSDREAM came in and bumped PROMISES KEPT in the opening
strides, raced between horses in the leading line early, was outpaced from the seven sixteenths, weakened inside around the turn, and had no more when
put to a drive into the lane. TOUCH BY FELICTY bobbled inward at the start, settled at the rear, trailed in the five to six path on the turn, floated into the lane

Footnotes
MEEKA chased the leaders on the outside early, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid at the quarter pole, dueled for the lead in upper stretch
and pulled clear in the final sixteenth. TIZ SUSAN ANN led the field up the backstretch, extended her lead from the two path around the turn, dueled in
upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. POINT STREAK chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch saved ground around the turn and
finished evenly to hold the show. LUNA FORTIS raced off the pace in the opening stages, began an outside bid approaching the five sixteenths pole,
entered the stretch from the five path and gained ground quickly on the outside in late stretch. BOURBON REBELLION raced in the middle of the pack on
the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the four path and gained ground late between horses in the final furlong.
CHROME ATTACK raced inside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and weakened in the final sixteenth of a
mile. EYE ON THE FINISH trailed the field on the inside early, raced in the two path around the turn and passed tiring horses while drifting out slightly in the
stretch. JOYSOME raced between horses in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and came up empty in the
stretch. TEMPLUNA trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch and into the turn, raced in the two path around the turn and was never a factor. IMA
LITTLE KITTEN tracked the leaders in the early going, angled out to find racing room headed into the turn, raced in the three path around the turn, began to
drop back approaching the quarter pole and continued to tire from there. IMA LITTLE KITTEN RAN UNDER THE WAIVER CLAIMING CONDITION.

Footnotes
SEQUINS STORM was pushed along to the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, kept the lead under a drive in the lane, and held to the wire.
ENZOEXPRESS tracked the leader inside of TIO CHUY down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, was pushed along two wide near the five
sixteenths, had aim on the leader two wide from upper stretch, kept on under a drive and cut into his advantage late but could not get to the pacesetter.
COME ON DOVER raced at the inside of the chasing line, shifted outside the leading pair under a drive midstretch, rallied and gained to the wire. SYRUP
raced between horses in the chasing flight, settled just behind that flight near the three eighths, switched three wide into the lane, rallied mildly while drifting
out in the lane, bumped HAUNTED MESA near the sixteenth pole and continued his mild improvement. Z U SOON soon trailed, raced in the three path on
the turn, rallied into the lane under a drive inside of W W RUSSIAN GOLD, switched six wide in upper stretch, improved mildly late, grazed HAUNTED
MESA near the sixteenth after that foe was bumped by SYRUP, and kept on. HAUNTED MESA raced four wide in the chasing flight, was urged in upper
stretch while still racing four wide, proved no match for the leaders, chased on past the furlong mark, was bumped soundly by SYRUP when that foe came
out near the sixteenth, grazed with Z U SOON, and weakened late. W W RUSSIAN GOLD broke in and bumped WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG, settled near
the rear on the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, swung out near the center of the track in upper stretch, but lacked the needed rally.
WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG was bumped by W W RUSSIAN GOLD in the opening strides, raced three wide in the chasing flight, was pushed along past
the three eighths, found himself outpaced by the leaders going into the lane and faded late. TIO CHUY bobbled in the opening strides, was pushed along to
track the leader outside of ENZOEXPRESS, tracked in the four path on the turn, began to flatten from the three eighths, came three wide into the lane and
continued to fade.

Footnotes
FOGGY FLIGHT chased the leading pair between horses early, kept on to track them in the three path on the turn, took closer order from the seven
sixteenths before being asked, rallied two wide into upper stretch, reeled in the leader midstretch under a drive, cleared, and held safe. SIMPLY FAST came
out in the opening strides and lightly bumped STOPSHOPPINGAMY, settled at the rear, improved in the four path on the turn, went to a drive three wide
near the quarter, sustained her bid four wide through midstretch, and gained to the wire. FIFTHATNARRAGANSET was bumped by NEW RULES in the
opening strides, settled three wide near the rear early, began to improve two wide on the turn, came into the lane in the three path, went to a drive near the
three sixteenths, responded with a rally, kept on between horses but was outkicked for the place. STOPSHOPPINGAMY was lightly bumped by SIMPLY
FAST in the opening strides, raced three wide in the chasing flight on the backstretch, was pushed along while chasing in the four to five path on the turn,
swung five wide into the lane, was forced out slightly further by TWO TURN TAMMY when she came out in upper stretch, nonetheless rallied, but was
outfinished between horses in the final furlong. LIPLINER was sent for speed, took pressure from NEW RULES to her outside early, inched to a clear lead
while saving ground on the turn, carried a diminishing lead in upper stretch, was headed approaching the furlong pole and weakened. TWO TURN TAMMY
raced at the inside of the chasing flight on the backstretch, was pushed along in the two path on the turn, swung four wide into the lane, forced out
STOPSHOPPINGAMY slightly when she came out further in upper stretch, was driven between horses, and came up empty in the final furlong. SUMMER
EXPRESS raced between horses near the rear early, continued in the rear pair in the two path on the turn, came into the lane under a drive, and offered no
rally. THE ROVING KIND settled toward the rear, saved ground through the turn, was driven in upper stretch, and had no response. NEW RULES broke
out, bumped FIFTHATNARRAGANSET, prompted the pace outside LIPLINER early, tracked the leader in the four path on the turn, lost ground three wide
into the lane and faded.
