Footnotes
DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT Checked at the five-eighths pole, gained four wide on the turn, reached the leaders three across a furlong out and drew clear while
under wraps late. TOMMY THE TORCH Vied for the lead along the three path, drifted in while between rivals at the furlong marker bothering HARRISON
KNOWS and finished clearly second best. LAKE RUDOLPH Well placed along the three path, two path into the lane, angled out and finished well.
HARRISON KNOWS Contested the lead along the two path, battled inside in the lane, was bothered by TOMMY THE TORCH at the furlong maker, took up
and then just missed the show. LOVEJOY Checked at the five-eighths pole, lagged back along the two path on the turn, angled out and closed well. GATTO
MARRONE Well placed along the rail and weakened. JERRY'S JUNKYARD Four wide on the turn, was not a threat. COURAGEOUS CRAFT Checked at
the start, two path on the turn, was outrun. LEGENDARY BID Drifted out nearing the five-eighths pole bothering rivals, five wide on the turn and tired.
BLESSED HONOUR Checked at the five-eighths pole, four wide into the lane and tired. ODIN'S HONOR Saved ground, was done early. A stewards inquiry
was posted along with a claim of foul by the rider of HARRISON KNOWS against TOMMY THE TORCH for interference at the furlong marker, resulted in
the disqualification of TOMMY THE TORCH from second to fourth.
