Footnotes
DR. BAGLEY vied outside a foe to the far turn, quickened on the turn and continued to battle down the lane, getting clear at the sixteenth marker to hold
sway. VANDROSS was unhurried in the rear group of horses, roused on the turn in the four path and steadily advanced down the lane to edge up for the
place spot. BOLD PROPHET vied inside the winner, quickened on the far turn to stay with that foe, continued to duel to the sixteenth pole and leveled out.
OSVALDO was reserved while off of the pace, pushed along on the turn and edged closer in late stretch. AULD CUP was unhurried inside, chased the pace
at the rail on the far turn and lacked kick from inside down the stretch. HONDO GUSTO raced well off the pace, went five wide into the stretch and was
empty in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SPECTACULAR ROAD had a reserved lead to the stretch, stayed clear of the rest of the foes who were under a drive to catch up in the stretch and held off
a horse that closed the gap late. STATESBORO raced off the pace to the turn, chased in earnest from there and had the best run late. SUNNY'S STORM
prompted the winner early, led, then lost the lead, was rank in the stretch then re-rallied late to run on and keep show. INDEPENDENT INDY was at the rear
to the turn and moved up and rallied mildly from inside late. STARSHIP MERCURY angled out early, chased the leaders and lacked a rally in the stretch.
WILDCAT LITE was involved to the turn and dropped back. GRAY DONOVAN was last shorlty after the start, stayed toward the rear runners and was no
threat.

PATTI PATTI PATTI was mid pack, chased the leaders through the turn and got past those foes readily down the stretch. KALISPELL tracked in hand, led
mid turn while still in hand, was urged at the top of the stretch but could not withstand the winner and came up second best. ABOGADA tracked mid pack
staying mostly even throughout but edged forward late for the show spot. AIKEN FOR GOLD raced off the pace early, got closer on the turn and had late
pace to improve position. MARIA ROSE was last early, moved up inside and improved position in the stretch. SOUTHERNPERFECTION held a reserved
lead from well off the rail early and gave way at the top of the stretch. TICKET TO RICHES was no threat.

ROCK STAR LADY back off leaders to turn, quick turn of foot, took over into the stretch and cleared. LEMON DEELITE had a terrible start, way back to
turn, mad an outside run from the quarter pole and was coming on strong too late. ARTIES CRYPTONITE just off pace rushed around leaders took over
past quarter pole but faltered in the late going. AUGMENTING ASSETS close up throughout with no late kick in the stretch run while evenly. WACKER'S
GIRL broke slow, far back to turn, came wide into stretch to improve late. CARMEN OHIO close to leader but started a slow decent from quarter pole and
faded back. COSTUME JEWELRY off slow, show little throughout. LUCKY DOUBLE D'S was through early and dropped back quickly. FRONT CIRCLE
raced evenly to the turn, could not go on and wilted. BUCKEYE BLING was very antsy in the gate, broke well when the gate sprung, had three wide speed
to the turn but was swarmed to the quarter pole and gave way readily. SWEET EMPIRE failed to menace, dropped far back.

RECKLESS L J veered out at the start, chased just off the leaders, led on the turn, angled in to hold position down the stretch and kept clear late. WHO DAT
MO was bothered by the winner veering out at the start, took the five path while off the lead on the backstretch, moved up in the three path on the turn to
confront the winner, was no match, got floated out by a foe and nailed that one for the place spot after a short battle. HENRY THE CAT swerved in at the
start bothering several foes, chased inside and behind the leaders, came off the rail in the stretch for room, floated out a foe, had second late but was nailed
at the wire after a brief duel, settling for show. IT'S YOUR CALL was bothered at the start by a foe veering in and raced evenly throughout. OCCUR was
bothered at the start by a chain reaction caused by a foe veering in and only improved position in the stretch. DENNY M showed speed in hand, dropped off
the lead on the turn and tired in the stretch. INSPIRED TO ROCK was bothered at the start by horses veering in and never close.

Footnotes
ALBERT'S BARN with the pace to turn, slowly took over into stretch, prevailed. LOOPALLU speed to the lead, battled through the stretch, gamely to wire.
JAMMING CAMERON raced evenly to deep stretch while mildly in the late going. CALL WEST no speed to turn, rallied to cut margin in the the drive.
FORBETTERORWORSE dueled to the turn, gave way from the quarter pole. UNCLE EARL never a menace. ELECTRIC AVENUE no a real menace
throughout. HORSEFEATHERS through early outside.
