ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM stalked the pace, moved up four wide nearing the eighth pole and just got up in his final strides under strong urging. BOUND FOR
BROADWAY pressed the early pace, raced two deep, led late and just missed in a game effort. CONGA IN PARIS was allowed to settle early, moved up
two wide through the stretch and closed willingly in the latter stages. CONGRATS ANSWER was unhurried early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and
had not enough. TRIKKI NIKKI set all the pace along the inside and gave way in the drive. WILLOW DRIVE broke awkwardly and never was a factor.

STREET LUTE pressed the early pace, raced five wide past the eighth pole and finished well to be clear late under all out pressure. SPIRITED BEAUTY set
all the pace, raced just off the inside in the stretch and finished second best. HOPE HAS A NAME stalked the pace, raced along the inside through the lane
and had not enough. TRIPLE DIGIT was slow early, raced four wide at the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. SIBA settled off the early going, raced
three wide in the stretch and never was a factor. CLOUT CHASER was slow early and never threatened. RSHEPHERDSGAIT failed to sustain a bid.
FORTHELOVEOFLYDIA raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

CONFESSOR pressed the pace along the inside down the backstretch, raced four in the four path through the lane and finished well to prevail under all out
pressure. PRETTY GOOD YEAR stalked the pace, moved up five wide through the stretch and closed in on the leader in the final stages. SUPER JOHN
stalked the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. WEATHER WIZ settled in the early
stages, moved up down the backstretch to challenge the leader, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no late bid. BEYOND THE VICTORY set all the
pace and tired readily in the drive.

the early pace, moved up around the far turn, lugged in a bit nearing the eighth pole, angled five wide through the lane and closed in well late. GAELIC

pole and had no response. HILL D'ORO stalked the pace, raced along the inside through the stretch and never was a factor. BEAM OF LIGHT settled off
the early going, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and never threatened. IMMENSE dropped back early and failed to respond.
BARBARA GORDON was slow early and never threatened. GUILDER showed good speed from the outside and gave way. BELVA LOCKWOOD failed to

Footnotes
QUICK SAND AA stalked the early pace, moved up four wide past the eighth pole and drove clear late. UPTOWN CRUISEDIRECTOR set all the pace
along the inside and was no match for the winner in the drive. COLORS IN MOTION was unhurried early, raced three wide through the lane and was no
match for the top pair. BELLFASTT stalked early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and weakened. LAZUR HESS stalked the pace while saving ground
and tired. KISSOUUR ducked into the gap soon after the break and lost all chance.
