managing to hang on to the wire. CAIRO COMET slow early emerged to threaten in the four path upper stretch bidding all out to the wire. PACK TWELVE
was checked along the rail outside the three eighths pole continuing on to chase into upper stretch pressing abreast a tiring leader faltering late. JOHNNY

through the lane in the three and two paths. MAKIN MONEY saved ground bidding in upper stretch angling out while hanging late. BONDARO chased
through the turn then weakened at mid track in upper stretch. EDDIE AT BAT was never involved. LOVIE'S BITER was always outrun. MORO CASH
chased early then faded on the turn. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION MIAMI MAGIC WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THIRD FOR INTERFERENCE

FISH TRAPPE ROAD pressed on the turn dueling abreast rival in upper stretch edging clear in the two path. YES DARLIN pressed inside on the turn
dueling from the rail in upper stretch ceding late hanging on for place. FIRST TALENT hustled through the turn bid willingly down the lane in the four and
five paths. LIL HABANERO away alertly dueled through the turn extending in the two path upper stretch weakening late. ARTAVIA sent hard on the inside
was steadied when in a bit close into upper stretch. INVOCATION slow early played no factor. MY PEOPLE SING was never involved. MARTY WHO faded
on the turn. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF ARTAVIA AGAINST THE RIDERS OF LIL HABANERO YES DARLIN AND FISH TRAPPE ROAD FOR
INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE STRETCH WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
