CONGRATS ANSWER hustled to a narrow lead inside, edged clear in the stretch and stayed safe holding off rival in final stages. RISQUE'S JEWEL settled
inside, awaited room on the turn, angled out in the stretch and closed well. LUSCIOUS LOLA prompted the leaders three wide then flattened out through the
stretch. SOUR MASH vied outside to the stretch and gradually weakened. FRISKY FEELING broke awkwardly, moved inside, angled wide on the turn and
proved empty.

Footnotes
VERRAZANO VITTORIA dueled inside, shook loose near stretch and quickly pulled clear under mild handling. ROCHELA saved ground in second flight,
took up chase on the turn but then was no match. MRS. CREWS, racing outside her stablemate, raced very wide into stretch, drifted in in early stretch and
fell back. NOT IN THE MOOD, well off the rail, eased out wider and passed faders. MAD MARY dueled for command between foes then tired. TWITTER
STORM was just off the rail and never threatened. DEAN'S TICKET, four wide and just off the early pace, tired badly. BERBERSLILBRIEBRIE saved
ground and showed little. MARY COSTA, who needed an equipment repair and was late leaving the paddock, lunged and broke right slamming into the side
of the gate causing her to lost his balance briefly, recovered quickly and was sent up wide then stopped

MABEL ISLAND set a measured pace inside, widened on the final turn and was kept to her task with a long advantage. LIGHT UP NIGHT broke very slowly
and moved inside, swung out advancing into the stretch and rallied while no match for the winner. WOOD BEE saved ground off the pacesetters, faded into
the stretch then came again for the show award. GO METRO GIRL broke sluggishly, chased outside and failed to menace. ABOVE PAR outrun early,
offered a middle move into the final turn then gave way. LUCKY OLIVIA ROSE prompted the winner outside to midway on the final turn and faded.

BABY BAM BAM stalked the pacesetter, bid to the front at the top of the stretch and eagerly drew away under moderate urging. YELLOW CHICK lacked
speed, split rivals advancing into the stretch and closed well. VALIANT SPIRIT chased outside and continued willingly to the finish. IWASBORNAWINNER
prompted the leaders three wide and weakened through the stretch. CASEYOUDIDN'TKNOW dropped back early and lacked a rally. IT'S A SHAW THING
hustled to the front inside, was collared on the turn and faltered. CAWAJA TIME chased outside, was asked for run on the turn but faded. BELLAMY CAT
trailed early then passed fading rivals. PASTICHE raced along the inside and gave way readily. LUCKY'S RANSOM raced far behind throughout.

MR. ROUNDTREE saved ground, waited briefly for racing room entering the stretch, moved to the outside and then closed relentlessly to just get up.
ALFATEI, between rivals early, eased out into stretch, opened a long lead but was nailed on the wire. SPACEMAN, bumped and squeezed back leaving the
gate, was two wide and tired. AMERICAN QUALITY, wide and just off the early pace, gave way. SAILOR AGAIN showed little passing tiring foes. ADMIRAL
EASTWOOD was extremely fractious in the gate then was outrun. BYCHANCE came out leaving the gate bumping with INSPIRING JUSTICE, set the pace
in three path then tired. NSPIRING JUSTICE came in leaving the gate bumping with BYCHANCE, stalked outside then tired. POLITY broke slowest then

CURLINGTON settled outside, split rivals rallying in mid-stretch and out-gamed several opponents to get up late. ESOR raced close up, took over on the
final turn, moved clear but was nailed nearing the wire. MAKOTO saved ground just off the leaders, angled out in the stretch and made a gradual late gain.
BOLD QUEST reserved outside, bid into the stretch but was outfinished. ON DUTY prompted the leader to the far turn then weakened. FACTUM LOVE
STYLE trailed for half a mile then passed tiring rivals. JAMA DILLON hustled to a clear lead to the final turn then gave way. REBEL TRAVELLER lacked
speed inside and failed to rally. BIG RAY chased wide early, began bearing out before the half and lost contact with his field.
