ROYAL GALAXY stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded when sat down for the drive, split rivals inside the
furlong grounds and was just up. MY CALL unhurried early from the outside, advanced through the turn, responded entering the drive, split rivals, brushed
with RIVERS RISING and just missed. RIVERS RISING chased the early pace from the inside, dueled through the drive, was brushed deep stretch and
lasted for the show. HOPE FOR CHANGE well placed from the outside, advanced through the turn, responded and had a late rally. LOUISIANA JAZZ broke
sharp from the outside, gained the early margin, dueled through the drive but could not keep pace. TALE OF THE BULL forced the early pace and tired.
RUNTOTEXAS was no factor. BROTHER DAVID was no threat. SILKY'S DANCE forced the early pace and gave way. DEFATTA was always outrun. Three

JADE'S AUTUMN SKY dueled from the inside early, gained a clear margin through the turn, remained forward but could not match strides. MCLEAN stalked
the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded but could not keep pace. OSO NEGRO chased the early pace outside,

tired. FLASH IT was no factor. HAIL STATE had a steady fade. MEGA MAX flashed early speed and tired. IRONIC forced the early pace outside and gave

but could not sustain the effort. LOOKING FOR BULL forced the early pace outside but came up empty in the drive. ITS A CITY DAY was no factor. SHAE'S
