Footnotes
ANCIENT TIMES broke in line with KAZ'S BEACH, quickly assumed the top and glided over to the inside route, showed the way, with NOBLE MISCHIEF
applying some pressure to the outside, conceded the advantage to the previously-mentioned rival between calls on the backstretch, tipped out into the two
path then sped up to re-engage NOBLE MISCHIEF, took over under a confident ride on the far turn, was coming up the three-sixteenths pole when called
upon for more, responded, lenghtening away, was in total control when geared down for much of the final sixteenth. BERNARDINO sat reserved in the two
path, came under a ride spinning into the stretch, lugged in slightly, eventually settling along the inside route, during the going between the furlong marker
and the sixteenth pole, bested TACKLE for place honors. TACKLE unhurried racing towards the two path during the opening phases, shifted into the three
path after stepping onto the backstretch, middle-moved itself into contention, kept watch within striking distance during the run around the second bend, got
turned loose for the drive home, failed to keep up once the winner was himself set down, flattened out and lost second. KAZ'S BEACH remained along the
inside after the start, was moved to the outside travelling on the backstretch, departed it from path three, flashed some interest when let out a notch, was
under urging swinging for path four for entrance into the stretch, mustered up a mild response. NEURO pursued the front runners from the two path,went
under a ride by the five-sixteenths marker, angled three wide into upper stretch, had no rally. NOBLE MISCHIEF a pace factor three wide on the clubhouse
bend, cleared the winner and went over to the rail shortly after entering the backstretch, vied with that foe afterwards until the general area of the
five-sixteenths pole, stepped into the lane and faltered. KEY TO VICTORY unsettled after the start, was in and amongst some rivals getting checked
crossing the finish line for the initial time, fell back several lengths, cut over to the rail by the end of the homestretch, stayed put, shifted out about two wide
in upper stretch, never made its presence felt. MAKE MOTIME strung out three wide on both turns, was through after going six furlongs.

Footnotes
SARATOGA LOVE showed speed on the inside of two foes then was taken back off the pace under a vigorous hold, tugged hard at the bit under stout
restraint while just behind the leaders, drafted inside on the turn, patiently awaited room turning into the stretch then was given a clear rail opening, was
asked inside the three-sixteenths, came through along the inside to make a bid nearing the furlong marker, fought on even terms for the lead into the final
furlong and prevailed under strong urging. GRAETZ bumped with a rival at the start, tracked the pace down the backstretch, was tucked into the three path
on the turn then given her cue at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the whip, advanced to make an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, battled
on even terms for the lead under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the place. FRACTORZATION broke out and bumped
with a foe then was hustled, disputed the pace on the outside while well out in the course, vied in the three to four path on the turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, battled with the top two into the final sixteenth, swapped back to her inside lead shortly thereafter and
was out-kicked while able to get the show. SILKY BLUE bumped with a rival at the start, settled towards the rear of the field, went four wide on the turn, was
roused at the five-sixteenths, came seven wide into upper stretch and finished willingly to get the last spot in the superfecta. CANARSIE ANGEL was guided
in towards the rear early then reached the fence, settled towards the back, saved ground on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came under the
whip into upper stretch, followed the winner through along the rail into the final furlong and improved position. MAGNOLIA'S LADY bumped with rivals at the
start, settled off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into the stretch then was put to the whip and
lacked the needed kick. MZ SEB PAT was away alertly from the outside post, settled outside under some coaxing, came under stronger encouragement in
the four path on the turn, was roused four more late on that bend then carried six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. WINIFRED J showed good speed
and contested the pace, vied inside to the two path on the turn, moved clearly off the rail into upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and
tired. THEA'S THEME was urged along on the far outside at the rear, went five wide on the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CIVIL UNION away in good order, kept watch on the pacesetter from the pocket, pilot applying a firm hold, was switched over to an abbreviated hand ride
crossing the midway point of turn three after falling back a tad, paused in hand before having the rider commit to taking a wide route for entrance into the
stretch, wound up towards path three after completing the maneuver, tipped the fourth one after BEAU BELLE went into path two herself, narrowed the gap,
began the final furlong fighting as the outermost of a threesome for the front end, emerged as the new leader with approximately a sixteenth to go, kicked
clear in the final seventy yards. MY SISTER NAT (FR) gently pinched coming out of the starting gate, got set up along the inside route, tracked the pace
while being fourth in line along it, ventured onward under the same set up all the way to the quarter pole, got cued for the drive, fanned out into path five
from upper to midstetch, becoming the widest of all, closed in well to get up for the place. BEAU BELLE established the top in short order, got guided over to
the rail, rated kindly showing the way, with an equally-rated LOVELY LUCKY in accompaniment in the two path, turned into the lane and got asked for more,
shifted into path two getting put to the test by the aforementioned opponent, saw the winner burst upon the scene approximately a sixteenth later, gave in to
heavy pressure in the general area of the sixteenth pole, stayed on for the show. LOVELY LUCKY corrected after coming out with her initial step, assumed
the role of primary pursuer, went about the chore well rated in the two path, came under stronger handling stepping onto the top of the lane, vied with vigour
between rivals during the final furlong, flattened out slightly, ultimately having to settle for the final significant slice of the pot. ELIADE (FR) underwent a
ground-saving journey, had no closing punch in the last eighth. PALLAS ATHENE reserved in the two path all the way to the end of the third bend,
commenced the stretch slightly wider, failed to fire. COMPLICIT pursued the front runners two wide in midpack, went into the stretch and gave way.

TIMELY TRADITION tracked the pace down the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, rallied outside to take the
lead at the three-sixteenths then was put to a right-handed whip, fought outside the runner-up under a continued right-handed whip to the wire and prevailed
under strong urging. POP A CHOC showed good early speed, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead outside the
quarter-pole then was asked, lost the advantage to the winner at the three-sixteenths, fought on with that foe under a right-handed whip into the final furlong,
switched to a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for the place. UNION MAIDEN settled on the outside, was asked
while five wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, pursued the top two under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick but
was clear for the show. SAY MOI was taken under a tight hold while outside early, moved in nearing the five-eighths pole, was reserved under a snug hold,
saved ground on the turn, was let out a notch around the three-eighths then glided closer passing the five-sixteenths before being taken under a tight hold
again behind a foe, steadied while shuffled back behind the stopping pacesetter approaching the quarter-pole, found room and came inside that foe while
along the rail in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. CARRIZO broke in then was corrected by the rider, was well placed down the backstretch,
went two then three wide on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole then driven into upper stretch and also lacked the needed response. FOREVER
CHANGED settled towards the rear, went three wide for most of the turn then moved four wide, was given her cue inside the five-sixteenths then driven five
wide into the stretch and came up empty. MARYANORGINGER moved up to set the pace under pressure to her outside, began to lug out slightly midway
down the backstretch, vied in the two path while continuing to lug out slightly on the turn, gave up the advantage without a fight outside the quarter-pole and
stopped. DON'T CALL ME MARY bobbled twice at the start, settled under some urging, dropped to the rear at the nine-sixteenths, fell well behind without
encouragement in the three to four path on the turn and was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
RESTORED ORDER retained the advantage after breaking sharply from the starting gate, took up residence along the outer border of the inside route, was
rated along setting split after split on an open lead, stepped into the lane, was coming up to the three-sixteenths marker when called upon for more, gave
the desired response, saw the runner up inch up belatedly but dug in with willingness to preserve the decision. HIDDEN ENEMY (IRE) took up the chase
two wide in midpack during the opening phases, got guided over to the rail at the conclusion of the backstretch, sat within striking distance of the winner, got
roused angling to the outside springing from the five-sixteenths marker, wound up back in the two path at the head of the stretch, lugged in after a right side
shot in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, had the pilot switch the stick to the opposite side and was gradually worked back into path two by midstretch,
made some headway in the final strides en route for the place. HARDISON fractious stepping onto the track, left both post parade and pony, proceeded to
come out of the gate without apparent mishap, dove over to the rail shortly afterwards, continued along it on the backstretch, slipped to the outside in the
general area of the three-eighths pole, got called upon for more a sixteenth down the road, swung out five wide for the drive, had a good finish down the
center of the course to earn the show award. AMERICAN DIAMOND off the inside early, stalked the winner from afar travelling in path two on the
backstretch, moved over to the rail at the top of the second bend, cut the corner into the lane, made no impact. LEASE brushed into the side of the gate
after lunging at the break, then got steadied right afterwards avoiding a rival close by, cut over towards the inside, abandoned that path for path two by the
top of the far turn, went three wide into the lane, made no headway in the last eighth. SIFTING SANDS (GB) loosely pocketed for a spell, departed the
backstretch from the three path, commenced the stretch slightly wider, came up empty. WORLD CRUISER underwent a ground-saving journey, never got
involved. FULCO at or near the two path for over three-quarters, gave way. MO HEAT positioned two wide racing around the clubhouse rurn, was parked
out four wide on the next one, got sent out six wide into the lane, folded.

wide into the stretch under a right-handed whip, switched to a left-handed whip while gaining into the final furlong and finished with good energy but was too
late while able to get the place. JESUS' TEAM bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed between horses into the first turn, was eased back off the
pace in the two path early on that bend then shifted to the three path, tracked outside on the backstretch, made a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the three
path on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed whip in upper stretch,
lost the lead to the winner inside the three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed whip just inside the furlong marker and was outfinished while clear for the
show. DR POST was asked to get position on the initial straightaway, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the
half-mile pole, came under stronger encouragement while four wide early on the far turn, was put to the whip outside the five-sixteenths then moved to five
wide, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. CELTIC STRIKER showed early speed outside of two foes, rounded the first
turn in the three path, contested the pace on the outside, vied between horses in the two path on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faded.
FIRST LINE bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, contested the pace on the inside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, vied along the
rail on the far turn, came under the whip with three furlongs to run, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and stopped.

Footnotes
FRANK'S ROCKETTE shook off a few light bumps in the shadow of the starting gate to assume a forward position, sparred for command from path two
beginning from the half mile pole, seemingly moved when ready as the half was being rattled off, poked a head down in front in time to lead the others into
the lane, arrived at the three-sixteenths marker and had the rider go to work, kicked clear, then remained comfortably so, kept busy to the end. REAGAN'S
EDGE off the inside throughout, underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, got set down leaving the five-sixteenths pole, spun into the lane, finished
willingly for the place, although no match for the winner today. CENTER AISLE made it into the two path by the conclusion of the backstretch, go worked
into path five after entering the stretch, rallied well enough to be along for the show. SECONDARY MARKET brushed from both sides shortly after the start,
got eased back to get out of that predicament, took up the chase from the two path, in between rivals for a portion of the trip on the turn, went into the lane,
kept pace for about a furlong then flattened out. SOUND MACHINE underwent several light bumps right after the start, displayed no ill effects from that
contact and got guided over to the rail, went on to cut the corner into the lane, had no closing punch. HELLO BEAUTIFUL grabbed the advantage after the
field had been sent off and running, slid over to the inside route as the first fraction was being finalized, showed the way, feeling pressure from FRANK'S
ROCKETTE out in the two path, got headed coming up to the quarter pole, stepped into the lane and faltered. UP IN SMOKE left the inside route a few
strides into the contest, was sighted in the two path at the top of the turn, got put to a drive in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, angled four wide into the
stretch, lacked the needed response. PURRFECTLY CLAIRE three wide on the turn, got fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, had no offering.

Footnotes
GLOBAL CAMPAIGN established the front after brief light coaxing from the gate, showed the way rated along the inside through the first turn and down the
backstretch under the watchful eye of TACITUS to the outside but facing little pressure save from his presence, remained along the rail into the far turn and
came under coaxing at the three-eighths quickening the tempo, took the inside route into upper stretch as his main danger got set down poised to the
outside, dug in under a drive inching away to the eighth pole, ultimately repelled the challenge to hold well to the finish kept to task. TACITUS took to the
inside shortly after the start before tipping to the two path into the opening bend so as not to get hemmed in by SPINOFF in behind a rated leader, attended
the pace of the aforementioned foe to the outside under rating through sensible splits patiently handled down the backstretch and through the far turn
perched just off the shoulder of GLOBAL CAMPAIGN still under rating through the latter portion of the bend nearing the quarter pole in stark contrast to the
busy winner along the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch with dead aim on the leader, got shaken off a bit to the eighth pole,
dug in under an off sided stick and hung to the finish while preserving the place honors from an oncoming pair. PRIORITIZE got floated four to five wide
through the first turn by SPINOFF to his inside who went three to four wide, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch near the rear of the
compact field, tucked to the two path at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made
late gain on the top pair as those rivals began to come back to the rest nearing the finish. SPINOFF went three to four wide through the first turn keeping
PRIORITIZE to his outside four to five wide, chased four then three wide just off the top pair, came under a ride at the three-eighths, continued three to four
wide into upper stretch and made some late gain through the stretch while unable to impact the top trio. MATH WIZARD away well, settled saving ground at
the tail of the field past the stands for the initial time and through the first turn before tipping to the two path down the backstretch, went back along the rail
into the far turn, came under urging three furlongs from home, tipped out three to four wide at the top of the stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
LIFE ON TOP went three wide on the first turn, was rated under a tight hold, drafted inside to the two path under stout restraint on the far turn, shifted four
wide while asked at the quarter-pole, rallied to the lead in upper stretch, fought with TRAFFIC PATTERN into the final sixteenth and held under strong
urging. OUR COUNTRY saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, rounded the far turn in the two path while still in reserve, tossed his head
around the five-sixteenths under restraint, was asked in the two path into the stretch, angled out around the three-sixteenths then bumped lightly with a foe,
rallied outside into the final furlong and finished with good courage to just get the place. TRAFFIC PATTERN showed early speed on the outside, went three
then two wide on the first turn, showed the way under pressure through quick fractions, vied inside on the far turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, turned
into the stretch under the whip, lost the advantage in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths, fought on determinedly with the winner into the final sixteenth and
was outfinished then just lost the place but was clear for the show. CORAGESCONTENDER saved ground on the first turn, settled near the middle of the
field, started the far turn in the two path, shifted three then four wide later on that bend, was roused near the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into the stretch
and lacked the needed response. OPERATIVE went around the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was
given his cue at the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive while behind the pacesetter in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. SHOOTIN THE BREEZE
went three wide on the first turn, settled well back in the field, started the far turn in the three path, angled five then six wide later on that bend, was carried
eight wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DOUBLY BLESSED saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, went two then three wide on
the far turn, waited behind horses from the five-sixteenths into the stretch, lugged in badly in the drive and failed to rally. IMPLIED VOLATILITY was hustled
from the start, showed speed between horses, raced in the two path on the first turn, dropped back late on that bend then moved out early on the
backstretch, moved back up to prompt the pace, vied in the two path while asked on the far turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired.
BEACHSIDE went three wide on the first turn, settled in the back half of the field, went four then five wide on the far turn, came seven wide into the stretch
and was no factor. JOY CITY went three to four wide on the first turn, bumped lightly with a foe early on the backstretch, was forwardly placed on the
outside, came under urging while three wide on the far turn then carried five wide into the stretch, brushed with the runner-up inside the three-sixteenths and
came up empty. STARSHIP BUBBA broke out then was hustled, showed speed on the inside of two foes, raced inside early on the turn then shifted to the
three path late on that bend, bumped lightly with a rival early on the backstretch, was rated just off the pace, went three wide on the far turn, dropped back
late on that bend and capitulated. KID CHOCOLATE was restless in the gate then broke a bit slow, fell well behind early, went three wide on the first turn,
dropped far back on the backstretch and was pulled up but walked off. (Rail at 18 Feet)
