Footnotes
MIZZEN AIR was urged to the lead outside a rival racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a clear margin to upper lane, drifted out late under pressure
but held ELUSIVE AMELIA on a safe margin to the end under firm handling. The latter broke readily, was urged to a forward placing near the inside tracking
just off the pacesetter for five furlongs, switched outside that foe nearing the lane to bid for command, shied a bit late when the winner difted out but proved
only second best. BEE BIT tracked just off the first flight into the backstretch, was urged to advance three deep after a half to prompt the leader into the far
turn and faded in the drive. LADY HIDEAWAY stumbled at the break, settled near the inside, saved ground throughout but made no impression. CSILLA,
caught four wide racing into the first turn, soon faded.

ROYALLY DECORATED broke readily to gain a forward placing three deep, angled inwards racing past the half mile marker to press the issue outside a
rival into the turn, dueled into the lane and shook clear late under firm handling. VIVO broke slowly, settled along the rail, gathered momentum nearing the
lane while shifting off the inside and continued willingly to improve position between foes to the end. READS LANDING angled inwards tracking just off the
first flight racing to the turn, shifted three deep while being prompted to challenge nearing the lane but lacked the needed final kick. THICK HAZE hopped at
the start, settled outside foes racing to the turn and failed to menace. SR. BOM BON, urged to the lead along the inside in the opening three sixteenths,
dueled for command into the turn and gave way leaving midstretch. FIFTHTOWNFLUSH settled between foes in the last flight and dropped out early.

GOLDENEYED sprinted to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, held sway while extending the advantage nearing
upper stretch and was kept to firm encouragement to maintain a safe advantage. PRESSING CONCERN broke slowly, recovered to track outside the first
flight, advanced four wide on the turn to the stretch and prevailed for the place honors while failing to gain even terms with the winner. DRIED PEPPER,
urged to a forward placing three deep tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, bid between racing into upper stretch but weakened late. TONY'S
TAPIT was briskly roused in early stages to gain a forward placing, made brief pursuit of the pacesetter between rivals into the turn and emptied out into the
lane. GOOD BOY ROY, stumbled, then was pinched back at the start and never gained contention. EOS ANIMATIONS tracked off the first flight racing off
the inside to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
TABIA broke outwards bumping ROCKNROLL ROCKET, was collected off that rival, pulled his way between foes shifting into the path of VOW OF
FRANCIS momentarily nearing the turn, continued to make steady progress gaining terms with the pacesetter while still under firm restraint racing into
upper stretch and was given some mild prompting in the final stages to secure a narrow advantage under confident handling in a ridden out effort. BLUE
JEANS N BEER sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, resisted the winner's challenge entering
upper stretch but proved only second best. ONOMATOPOEIA, reserved along the inside in early stages, advanced to contention along the rail nearing
upper stretch, shifted a bit off the rail in upper stretch but had no late kick. VOW OF FRANCIS, forwardly placed between foes stalking just off the
pacesetter, was brushed while being shuffled out of close quarters nearing the turn, angled inwards a bit entering the turn and continued evenly between
rivals. SON OF POSEIDON, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the pacesetter, was fanned five wide nearing the lane and steadily faded.
ROCKNROLL ROCKET, bumped at the start, switched outside rivals early, continued four wide into the turn, was fanned six wide nearing upper stretch and
soon gave way. GATITO was quickly outdistanced, then pulled up by his rider but walked off under his own power.

OFF THE MEDS was rated along the inside tracking off the first flight inside foes to the backstretch, steadily drew into striking position while shifting out
three wide on the far turn, moved to challenge for command nearing midstretch and took over under firm encouragement. AUBEY RIDGE prompted the
pace between foes into the backstretch, edged forward nearing upper stretch, drifted out nearing the furlong marker but proved no match for the winner. BIG
MAN BOB settled between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide entering the lane and continued well enough to prevail for a share. HURTS
SO GOOD, urged inside rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, dueled for command to the far turn and gave way into the lane.
IMA HARLEY TOO, off a step slowly, was settled three deep between foes racing to the backstretch, was fanned four wide between foes nearing the lane
and steadily faded. FUDGE TOUGH, forwardly placed three wide attending the pace racing to the backstretch, steadily faded nearing the lane, then was
pulled up racing past the wire suffering an apparent injury and was vanned off the course. LOVE MY BOSS, caught four wide as part of the last flight racing
into the first turn, was fanned five wide nearing the lane but proved no threat.

Footnotes
COLLEGE PARTY broke readily, angled inwards to force the pace outside GIANT GAMBLE racing into the turn, continued to dispute the lead in a
prolonged drive to late stages and narrowly prevailed in time under brisk handling. BIG SPORT broke inwards, was righted to track just off the first flight
racing to the turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch and was gaining well late to close the gap while edging a rival for the place honors. GIANT
GAMBLE, urged to the lead along the rail in the opening stages, dueled for command racing into the turn, then into the stretch and grudgingly resisted the
winner to the end. EXECUTIVE DECREE bobbled at the start, recovered to track just off the second flight between foes into the turn and continued evenly
to late stages. BEYOND STREETSMART, brushed, then shuffled back at the start, passed between tiring rivals late. YEAH YEAH angled to the rail tracking
the leaders from out of striking distance and lacked a closing response. PRAISE BE TO GOD settled near the inside early and proved no threat. THIRTY
SECONDS OUT made brief pursuit of the leaders racing four wide into the turn and gave way early.

SUMMER LOVIN hopped at the start, was held up last dropping well off the field while angling to the inside racing through the backstretch, shifted out on the
turn, advanced on the leaders five wide into upper stretch and wrested the advantage from BISCOTTINI in time under steady encouragement. The latter
was urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail in the opening stages, dueled for command between foes on the turn, went clear into upper stretch and just
failed to contain the winner. GREATEST GAL tracked off the first flight between foes in early stages, shifted out four racing into upper stretch and continued
to improve position. PARTY LIGHTS, prompted to a forward placing along the inside, lodged a brief bid along the rail racing into the turn but flattened out in
upper stretch. SIDASTA, forwardly placed outside foes tracking just off the leaders, pressed the issue three wide racing into the turn and gave way into the
lane. WESTERN ATTIRE tracked off the second flight between foes to the turn but lacked a late response. ANGIEMEANSBUSINESS, urged prompting a
rival's pace in the opening quarter, gave way early. ROSIE'S FLOWER'S dropped out early.

Footnotes
ZANSHOES broke readily, angled to the inside dictating the pace, forged clear midway through the turn and held sway to the end under firm hand urging.
RENOVATION ducked inwards at the start, then was held up momentarily, gained momentum racing into the turn, switched outside a tiring foe to split rivals
racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors nearest the rail. MUWAAN MAT tracked the pacesetter between
foes in second flight racing into the turn and was outkicked for second late. UNDECIDEDCERTAINTY tracked the pacesetter four wide in second flight
racing into the turn, bore out entering the lane and gave way. FAIRY SURPRISE, urged to a forward placing between foes in the opening stages, angled
inside nearing the turn and soon gave way. SKIPTEASE proved no factor. BRAHMS IS WHO was pulled up nearing the turn and was vanned off the course.

Footnotes
MAY WE ALL, forwardly placed along the inside prompting a rival's pace, kicked clear racing into the turn and held sway to the end under steady pressure.
TRUE WEST tracked just off the first flight between foes racing into the turn and continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others. HATTIES
JEWEL, bumped at the start, was held up out of close quarters just after the break, continued under light rating while angling inwards, split rivals just off the
inside entering the lane and improved position to the end. NORTHERNBRILLIANCE tracked the leaders along the inside just off the second flight, saved
ground to the stretch and continued evenly. CANDY WOMPUS broke outwards bumping HATTIES JEWEL, was righted to track off the first flight between
rivals, was prompted to advance racing four wide between foes into the lane but had no final kick. SWEEPING EDGE, bumped hard at the start, tracked the
leaders outside rivals, was fanned five wide into the lane and had no rally. FORMIDABLE FORCE settled outside foes racing to the turn and failed to
menace. MOMENT OF MAGIC broke in bumping SWEEPING EDGE, was quickly right to force the pace outside a rival racing into the turn and gave way
early.

Footnotes
MY MISS MARILYN angled inwards while moving to gain a position just off the leaders racing to the turn, continued with a steady bid advancing three deep
to challenge racing through the turn, wrested the advantage and went clear under pressure. DROP O' CHOCOLATE, bumped at the break, angled to the rail
pressing the pace racing into the turn, gained a brief advantage nearing upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. GIVE EM
SHADE broke inwards bumping, was righted to press the pace between foes racing into the turn and weakened nearing the lane. RIVER SWAN tracked off
the first flight along the inside, was steadied when shut off by SWEET ECLIPSE entering the turn, then angled four wide racing into the lane while continuing
evenly. SWEET ECLIPSE tracked off the first flight in early stages, angled to the rail racing into the turn and soon gave way. HOLYCOW SHES FANCY
dislodged her rider before the start to run loose momentarily before being collected by the outrider, broke slowly and failed to menace thereafter. DATA
QUICK, held up in close quarters after the opening furlong, switched outside rivals nearing the turn and soon retreated.

Footnotes
DIRECT IMPACT was settled along the rail as part of the last flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn to upper stretch, tipped out
while being roused to advance between foes and wrested a clear advantage in time under firm handling. DEVIL VISION broke slowly, was settled between
foes racing to the backstretch, split foes three deep nearing upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors late. MAS TAKELA was rated stalking just off
the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight, came through to gain the advantage when presented an opening nearing upper stretch but faltered in late
stages. RUN AWAY FLASH, held up off the first flight while switching well to the outside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four, then five
wide into the lane and was outkicked for a share. STING BEE sped to the fore along the inside racing to the backstretch, dictated the pace on a narrow
margin to the far turn, bore out nearing upper stretch and abruptly gave way. YOU GOT THE LOOK, urged to a forward placing three wide tracking just off
the pacesetter in the opening half, gave way between foes nearing the lane and was shuffled out of close quarters in upper stretch. GOLD AND SKOL,
urged to a forward placing between foes tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, gave way into the lane. CLARK AND ADDISON, caught four
wide racing into the first turn, tracked off the first flight into the backstretch and emptied out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF YOU GOT THE
LOOK LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF DEVIL VISION ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM
WAS DISALLOWED.
