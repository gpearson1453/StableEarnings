sixteenth. AFFLUENTIAL raced off the pace inside, moved up on the far turn, came five wide into the lane, rallied, finished well but did not threaten the
winner. KRISTI'S COPILOT raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn and rallied mildly inside for third. CARPENTER raced off the pace inside,
between rivals on the far turn and lacked a rally. IMMUNITY raced off the pace outside a rival, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. PAPA JOEL
raced three wide on the first turn, chased three wide and tired. UHWARRIE SKY raced off the pace between rivals and failed to threaten. ANIMAL TRICK

the quarter pole, could not stay with the winner, then dug in gamely outside and came again late. RISEN CHANGE steadied a bit at the start, was outrun
early, moved up three wide on the turn and rallied mildly. BRIDGE TO BROOKLYN raced off the pace, moved up four wide on the turn, came five wide into
the lane and closed belatedly outside. RIGHT NOTION was off slowly, chased inside, came three wide into the lane and weakened. DIVA DANA chased
between rivals, continued between horses on the turn and gave way. VALID TREASURE showed good early speed to set the pace and gave way readily on

FACTOIRE vied inside for the early lead, shook free, steadied slightly midway on the turn, responded when roused, kicked away and dug in gamely late.
TOWN OF GOLD chased inside, came three wide into the lane, finished well outside but second best. TWIRLING FIRE vied two wide for the early lead,
chased FACTOIRE to the quarter pole, weakened and held on for third. TIZ HANDSOME was off slowly, raced two wide off the pace, closed late between
rivals and got the nod for fourth. BRINGING THE HEAT was outrun early, came two wide into the lane and closed well late outside. KAZ BANKING was
fractious in the gate, backed out and reloaded, then chased outside, drifted wide on the turn and weakened. FLIPPING FUN was a bit reluctant to load,
raced off the pace, chased inside on the turn and weakened. NORDIC RHYTHM raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

TY RAN A HOMER stalked outside, raced three wide at the half mile marker, bid on the far turn, dueled with MAROON MANIAC at the quarter pole, put a
head in front, responded when roused and edged away in the final sixteenth, driving. MAROON MANIAC set a pressured pace on the inside, showed the
way into the far turn, dueled with the winner passing the quarter pole, dug in gamely inside and tried to battle back past the furlong marker, then yielded.
MARKSMAN tracked inside, chased inside on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly. IDLE TIME pressed the pace in the early stages,
then chased between rivals and tired. ORBERT bobbled at the break, raced off the pace outside a rival and failed to respond when asked. DESPERADO
raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

SAMMY'S MINESHAFT dueled inside in a three way early duel, dueled inside on the turn, responded when roused, turned back a bid from LAZARUS
PROJECT in upper stretch and drew clear, driving. LAZARUS PROJECT raced off the dueling leaders early, bid three wide on the turn, rallied outside in the
stretch drive and was no match for the winner. HIGH FIVE COTTON dueled three wide for the early lead, dueled outside SAMMY'S MINESHAFT on the
turn, raced between rivals at the quarter pole and was outkicked. HE IZ GONE dueled between rivals for the early lead, then chased inside and tired. CALL
THE CAT was fractious behind the gate and very reluctant to load, then lost his action soon after the start and dropped far back, walked off.

held on late in a determined effort. CALL ME DADDY vied three wide for the early lead, stalked outside, dueled on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch,
dug in gamely outside the winner in the final furlong but could not get by. THREENINETYTWO stalked outside, raced three wide on the far turn, came wide,
finished evenly and failed to threaten. PLATO was off slowly, pulled early and was steadied on the first turn, came through on the rail to contest the pace,
dueled past the half mile marker, chased on the far turn and tired. ROYAL COUP raced six wide entering the first turn, continued four wide off the pace, four
wide on the far turn and weakened. NICE OF ME raced four wide early, settled off the pace between rivals, then had no rally. WARRANT OFFICER raced
