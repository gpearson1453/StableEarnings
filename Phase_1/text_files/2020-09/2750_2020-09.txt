LADDIE BOY chased the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch, had a late kick in the final stages and was just up at
the wire. REASON TO SOAR tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane while making a bid, took over and edged clear in the stretch but was
caught in the final stages. PARK RIDGE BENNY was a bit slow at the start and raced back early on, was on the inside into the lane, made a bid down the
lane from the rail, was gaining in the final stages and just missed place. VICTORY ELEMENT set the pace early, raced along the inside into the lane, was
overtaken near the eighth pole and yielded in the final stages from between horses. STRONG YEN stalked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and
flattened out late in the stretch run. STAY HOME was never a threat. MOST MISCHIEF came out at the start and was through after a half.

Footnotes
ARABIAN PRINCE rallied from far off of the pace three wide around the turn, shifted four wide turning for home, blew past the leader at the furlong pole,
drew off and was kept to task. KEEPMEINMIND was away awkwardly, tracked from midpack five wide, tucked down two wide under a drive at the five
furlong pole, chased the pace along the inside around the turn, advanced along the rail to be behind the leader in upper stretch, bumped LOUMO while
shifted two wide in tight quarters, split foes, and stayed on inside of the leader for place. LAKER MAMBA trailed after a bit of stuttered step start, advanced
in the four to five path around the turn, and sustained mild rally outside of foes for show. LOUMO stalked the pace four to three wide, but failed to respond to
coaxing passing the three furlong pole, was outkicked by the eventual winner in upper stretch, bumped by KEEPMEINMIND at the furlong pole, then tired
and got outfinished for show. JOHNY'S FIREBALL dueled for the lead two wide early on, cleared his inner counterpart at the half mile pole and held his
margin around the turn, but was headed by multiple rivals passing the furlong pole, and gave way. BRYCE CANYON stalked the pace three to two wide, but
failed to keep pace with the leaders turning for home, then weakened between horses in upper stretch. BUCKETS OF RAIN was always outrun. DEWY'S
HIT dueled for the lead inside of JOHNY'S FIREBALL early on, but weakened approaching the half mile pole, was done early, and eased.

Footnotes
AIN'T NO ELMERS stalked the loose leader two wide, inched forward and bid for the lead in hand approaching the five sixteenths pole, forged a lead at the
three sixteenths pole while feeling pressure from PERFECT HAPPINESS, then kept that foe at bay under driving pressure through the late stages.
PERFECT HAPPINESS stalked three wide, made a three wide bid for the lead turning for home, but was fended off by an inner foe through the lane.
DIAMOND CRAZY saved ground in midpack, shifted to the three path in midstretch, and offered a mild late kick for a minor reward. A THOUSAND
REASONS pulled clear early on, dug in to hold an advantage from AIN'T NO ELMERS at the five sixteenths pole, but was headed by that foe at the three
sixteenths pole and gave way. CLUB CAR saved ground far off of the pace around the turn, altered course from the three to five path in midstretch to be
outside of leading foes, but failed to menace. LADY OF LUXURY raced off of the pace in the four path around the turn, but failed to produce a bid before
tiring on her left lead through the lane. TIZ ELLA raced far off of the pace two wide early on, but was outrun.

Footnotes
EBBEN pressed the pace setter from along the inside, allowed that foe to clear off turning for home, but responded when set down passing the quarter pole,
rebid for the lead along the rail in upper stretch, then drew away from his outer counterpart passing the furlong pole. MY SIXTH SENSE set the pace outside
of EBBEN, drew clear from that foe turning for home, but was reengaged by that rival in upper stretch, was headed at the furlong pole, then kept on to prove
second best. THIRSTFORLIFE retreated from midpack to be far off of the pace into the turn, saved ground around the bend, but was shuffled back behind
TROUBLING MOON turning for home, cut the corner and commenced a rally passing the quarter pole, but was blocked behind LORD DRAGON from the
three sixteenths pole to the furlong pole, surged along the rail when that foe drifted out subtly, and prevailed for show. ROYAL MESA was forwardly placed
five wide, shifted four wide at the nine sixteenths pole causing BORRACHO to steady, tracked four to three wide around the turn, then kept on through the
lane while failing to make headway on the clear leaders, then got nailed for show on the wire. LORD DRAGON was forwardly placed in about the two path
around the turn, chased the clear leaders in upper stretch, but weakened between horses at the furlong pole. EASY SHOT trailed the field early on, shifted
three wide and between horses turning for home, rallied to split foes at the furlong pole, altered course to the four path at the sixteenth pole, but did not have
enough to achieve show. NIFTY raced far off of the pace in the four to five path, and produced a mild kick, but failed to threaten. TWO THIRTY FIVE shifted
from the three path to the five path turning for home while off of the pace, and failed to threaten. TROUBLING MOON saved ground off of the pace, but
never got involved. BORRACHO was forwardly placed four wide and between horses, but steadied when put to tight quarters at the nine sixteenths pole,
shifted to the six path turning for home, but failed to make an impact.

AMBASSADOR LUNA stalked the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path to be outside of the leaders at the five sixteenths pole, produced a bid
between horses at the quarter pole while being floated to the four path, then drew away from an outer foe passing the furlong pole. TOMLIN tracked the
pace from the three to four path around the turn, produced a three wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole while being fanned to the five path by inner foes,
then vied through a long drive in upper stretch, but was repelled by an inner foe passing the furlong pole. CHANGE OF CONTROL trailed the field in the
four to two path around the turn, produced a bid inside drifting foes passing the quarter pole, but flattened out in midstretch. STONEWOOD rushed after a
bit of a slow start, dueled for the lead two wide, inherited an advantage when her inner counterpart weakened at the five sixteenths pole, drifted to the three
path turning for home to meet outer foes bids, allowed racing room for an inner foe to make a bid in the process, then weakened between horses at the
three sixteenths pole. BREAK EVEN hopped a bit at the start, rushed to duel for the lead inside of STONEWOOD, but weakened turning for home, was
eased in upper stretch, then pulled up and dismounted at the wire, bled noticeably, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
PRIORITIZER was off a step slow, rushed to set the pace along the inside, shook free from chasing foes in upper stretch, and widened under driving
pressure. COMPANY CLOWN tracked from midpack five to four wide around the turn, produced a place bid while shifting three wide passing the quarter
pole, forged that position from tiring foes, but was no match for the leader, then held place in the late stages. FAST CASH was pinched between rivals early
on which caused him to race far off of the pace, advanced in the three to four path around the turn before shifting to the five path turning for home, then
stayed on well, but failed to reach place. BELFAST BOY was bumped by an outer foe at the start, saved ground far off of the pace before darting four wide
in upper stretch, then stayed on, but failed to menace. WINGING WAYS had a slow start, stalked the pace along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the
leader in upper stretch, and faded. SAG HARBOR tracked from midpack four to three wide and between horses, but weakened approaching the quarter
pole. MAGA COUNTRY bumped an inner foe at the start, trailed the field around the turn, came into the lane in the five path, and passed tired foes. WE'RE
STILL HERE pressed the pace setter two wide, but weakened between horses turning for home. CAN IMAGINE was bumped and steadied early on
between horses, raced far off of the pace four wide before being bothered by an inner foe into the turn, then failed to factor. COLONEL'S MAP was bumped
and steadied between horses early on, raced far off the pace three wide and between horses, but steadied again when put to tight quarters at the three
furlong pole, and weakened. ULTIMATE FIGHTER tracked from midpack three to two wide, then cut the corner while weakening turning for home.
