Footnotes
SASSY SENECA quickly cleared to the lead, set the pace in the three path while taking some pressure from MODERN MUSE around the turn, shook off
RUMPLEMINX when put to a drive in upper stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth but had just enough to hold off her pursuers. FULL OF GRACE bobbled
in the opening strides, chased outside of JANET'S MAE for the backstretch run, was asked near the three eighths and took closer order in the four to five
path on the turn, went to a drive near the quarter, rallied four wide in the final furlong and narrowly missed. MODERN MUSE pulled to track behind the
leader, pressed outside of the pacesetter around the turn, lost ground on her in upper stretch, gained late as she tired, but was outfinished between horses
for the place. RUMPLEMINX chased at the rear of the main pack early, saved ground while chasing the leading pair inside of FULL OF GRACE on the
bend, took closer order approaching the quarter, was driven just behind and inside of SASSY SENECA into the stretch, could not get to her, switched out
three wide near the furlong pole, and kept on with interest. JANET'S MAE tracked the leading pair early but settled back to race at the rear of the main pack
in the three path on the turn, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, took closer order but proved no threat. SETTLE DOWN EILEEN settled at the rear,
trailed in the five to six path on the turn, took closer order toward the middle of the track in the stretch but ultimately never threatened.

Footnotes
MALIBU JACK pressed outside of JIMMY'S MARCO, engaged outside of that foe past the three eighths, led at the quarter, kicked well clear when ridden
near the three sixteenths, and continued to draw off. JIMMY'S MARCO led narrowly early while taking pressure from MALIBU JACK, vied inside of him past
the three eighths, lost the lead for good near the quarter, could not match the winner under a drive in upper stretch, but kept on well enough to hold second
narrowly. UNCLE TAP settled at the inside of the rear pair, chased while saving ground on the turn, was driven to gain inside down the lane, slipped in
between JIMMY'S MARCO and the rail in the final furlong, but could not catch him for place. BOBBY BOOTS chased the leading pair in the pocket early,
pursued in the three path on the turn as the two leaders opened up on him, swung three wide into upper stretch and went to a drive, but mustered no
response. BOSS HUGO settled two wide in the rear pair, was outpaced in the three to four path from the three eighths, was driven from upper stretch, took
mildly closer order in the final furlong but never threatened.

Footnotes
HERBIE chased at the rear of the main group early, advanced inside of TOWARDS THE LIGHT into the turn, tracked while racing inside of him into the
bend, cruised up inside of OH BROTHER JACK past the five sixteenths to take the lead, went to a drive approaching the furlong mark, dug in when
challenged by ONOMATOPOEIA to his outside, exchanged brushes with that foe and held to the wire. ONOMATOPOEIA raced in second last while well off
of main group early, continued toward the rear in the three path on the turn, took closer order approaching the turn for home, bid inside of horses into the
lane, pushed TOWARD THE LIGHT out in upper stretch when switching out to sustain his bid, loomed to HERBIE's outside through the final furlong,
exchanged brushes with the leader and could not get by. TOWARDS THE LIGHT was quickest to the lead in the opening furlong but tracked in second
when OH BROTHER JACK was intent to go, tracked the pacesetter outside of HERBIE into the turn, took closer order outside of that foe, engaged three
wide outside of OH BROTHER JACK past the five sixteenths, came into the stretch outside of and just behind HERBIE, could not go with him into the lane,
was pushed out in upper stretch when ONOMATOPOEIA came out inside of him, chased on and had just enough under urging between horses to hold the
show. HATTIES JEWEL chased the leading trio down the backstretch and in the six path on the turn, was driven four wide into the lane, proved no match for
the leading pair and was outfinished three wide for show. FIVE STAR CREEK tracked the leading pair early, chased in the three to four path on the turn,
was urged inside horses into the stretch, went to a drive approaching the furlong pole, but kept on only evenly. MASTERFUL STRIDE trailed early, raced in
the two path on the turn, took closer order in upper stretch but could not sustain a rally. OH BROTHER JACK did not break on top but went keenly to the
lead three wide, was pushed along to maintain his advantage into the turn, set the pace in the three to four path, was headed from the inside by HERBIE
past the five sixteenths, readily capitulated, had no more when driven in upper stretch, and faded.

Footnotes
MIZZANNA raced well off the rail through the first turn at the rear of the main field, continued behind the chasing flight down the backstretch, was angled
three wide into the far turn, improved in the five to six path, swung four wide into the stretch, continued her rally, took the lead outside of TURQUOISE
TRAIL near the sixteenth mark and cleared. TURQUOISE TRAIL soon led, took pressure from MUWAAN MAT to her outside down the backstretch and
while saving ground through the far turn, kicked clear again when urged into the lane, was driven to maintain her lead but had no answer for the winner in
the final sixteenth. MUWAAN MAT stalked outside of TURQUOISE TRAIL through the clubhouse turn, pulled ahead to press outside her into the
backstretch,could not match MIZZANNA into the lane, chased her between horses in upper stretch, kept on under a drive in the final furlong and held show.
BAILDON chased three wide through the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch, was pushed outside of GOLDEN LILY into the second turn, raced three
wide in range around the bend, came three wide into the stretch, was outpaced by the leaders from past the three sixteenths, kept on evenly in the final
furlong and missed the show. GOLDEN LILY raced at the inside of the chasing flight, was pushed into the far turn, chased in the two path, continued inside
horses under a drive in upper stretch, but weakened in the final furlong. BRAHMS IS WHO settled at the rear, raced two wide in the rear flight around the far
turn, and lacked the needed rally in the lane. JAKEALINA chased between horses, began to fade in the three path approaching the three eighths, and had
no more in the lane. AUNT ETHEL settled in second last early, was pushed along inside of BRAHMS IS WHO in the rear flight on the far turn and was
driven hard into the lane, but found no bid in response.

Footnotes
PLEASANT MOON tracked three wide on the clubhouse turn, raced into the backstretch three wide with the leading line with her head just behind ROW
THE BOAT, bid in earnest outside of DRAMA IN DANUBE near the three eighths, vied outside her, went to a drive in upper stretch, continued to vie outside
of DRAMA IN DANUBE down the lane, got her head in front for good near the sixteenth, and prevailed. DRAMA IN DANUBE led into the clubhouse turn,
continued to set the pace down the backstretch while attended by ROW THE BOAT to her immediate outside, briefly cleared into the far turn, was engaged
by PLEASANT MOON to her outside near the three eighths, dug in under a drive, but was outfinished in the final sixteenth. ROW THE BOAT tracked the
leader between horses through the clubhouse turn, pressed outside of DRAMA IN DANUBE down the backstretch, did not go with that one into the turn but
instead tracked behind in the three path, could not go with the leading pair from the five sixteenths, but chased on well enough to hold the show.
FLANAGAN chased inside of BEE BRIDGE toward the rear through the clubhouse turn, continued patiently toward the rear into the backstretch, was urged
in the five path with the rear group through the far turn, came three wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. WHERE'S OLIVER was a bit slow
into stride and soon trailed, was pushed along from the rear through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch but continued to trail, was still urged in the
four path on the second turn, came into the lane between horses, and mustered no bid. BRANDY CHASER raced at the inside of the tracking flight through
the first turn, settled back behind the leading line into the backstretch, was urged in the two path on the far turn, and weakened in the lane. BEE BRIDGE
settled two wide toward the rear through the clubhouse turn, edged past FLANAGAN to race midfield into the backstretch, was pushed along into the far turn
but offered no response to keep up with the leaders, raced near the rear in the four path on the far turn, and continued to weaken in the lane.

SOME WOULD SAY engaged to duel inside of DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER, drove to a defined lead past the three sixteenths, opened up past the furlong
mark and held clear under a drive. SCENT OF SUCCESS tracked the leading pair, was pushed along in the two path behind them on the turn, swung out
and rallied three wide under a drive from upper stretch, got up for place outside of DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER past the sixteenth but proved no match for the
winner. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER was urged for early speed, dueled outside of SOME WOULD SAY, floated out to the five path while turning for home
under a drive, could not match SOME WOULD SAY in the final furlong, weakened in the final furlong and lost the place past the sixteenth. MOONSHINE
MOXY chased three wide between horses early, chased outside of MAJESTIC STRIDE while well behind the leading trio, never threatened them in the lane
but chased on evenly in the final furlong to prove best of the rest. MAJESTIC STRIDE raced between horses early, was pushed in the two path directly
inside of MOONSHINE MOXY on the turn, offered no bid in the lane and weakened in the final furlong. LA GLORIA chased four wide early, lost ground on
the leaders in the four to five path on the turn, and had no rally in the lane. CAROLS CUPCAKE soon trailed, continued detached from the rest of the field
around the turn, and never challenged.

seven sixteenths while racing three to four wide, circled four wide into the lane, sustained her rally in a grinding fashion, drove to the lead near the sixteenth
and narrowly outfinished PARTY LIGHTS. The latter broke in and lightly bumped TEMUJIN LADY, chased toward the rear of a well-bunched field outside of
SIDASTA early, raced patiently two to three wide on the bend, dropped inside near the quarter and improved into the lane, sustained her rally between
horses in the final furlong and just missed. FACING NORTH showed pace three wide between horses early, continued between horses in the leading flight
around the turn, vied outside of PEARLE DE VEEN in upper stretch, could not stave off the closers in the final sixteenth but kept on gamely for show.

upper stretch and rallied mildly, then evened out in the final furlong. PEARLE DE VEENE raced at the inside of the leading flight, continued to attend the
pace inside around the turn, vied inside of FACING NORTH past midstretch, but weakened in the final sixteenth. ALOTTA SOUL raced five wide in the
leading flight early, was pushed to the lead three wide past the seven sixteenths,continued in the leading flight until she flattened out three wide into the
lane, then kept on evenly in the final furlong. POKEGAMA raced four wide early at the rear of the leading flight, tracked the leading trio past the half, was
urged to keep up in the five path on the turn, flattened out into the lane and had no response under a drive. LA TORMENTA was hustled hard for speed

Footnotes
SIOUX VALLEY raced between horses at the rear of the chasing flight in the opening furlong, kept on between horses with the chasing flight on the turn,
was taken three wide in upper stretch, rallied under a drive, and got up three wide in the final strides. RASMUS led narrowly early, disputed the pace two
wide from the half, could not hold off the late charge of SIOUX VALLEY in the final strides but dug in to keep his head in front for place. CIRCLE ME BERT
pressed inside of RASMUS early, disputed the pace inside of that foe from the half, kept on doggedly under a drive, could not stave off SIOUX VALLEY and
was narrowly outfinished by RASMUS for the place. DERBYS MONEYMAKER chased three wide between horses to the half, continued three wide around
the bend and into the lane, lacked the needed kick in the lane but kept on well enough to salvage fourth. GOTTA LIL CAPTAIN settled at the rear, raced in
the two to three path on the turn, regained touch with the rear of the field approaching the turn for home, bumped the fading STAYCATION in upper stretch
and ultimately proved no threat. RAJA'S APPEAL chased four wide early, began to lose ground from the half, was pushed along in the four to five path past
the seven sixteenths, was driven three wide into the lane but proved empty. STAYCATION chased the leading pair inside horses, was hard ridden past the
seven sixteenths, emptied out past the five sixteenths, was bumped by GOTTA LIL CAPTAIN in upper stretch and continued to fade.

ARRESTING was bumped in the opening strides by BLUES TOUCH but nonetheless asserted a clear lead into the clubhouse turn, continued well off the
inside on an unchallenged lead down the backstretch, led in the two to three path on the far turn, and kept on well clear under a drive in the lane.
HUNTER'S HELLCAT raced near the rear inside horses through the clubhouse turn, continued inside of STING BEE toward the rear down the backstretch,
was pushed along to gain in the three path on the far turn, swung three wide into the lane and was driven for a bid, got up for second three wide past the
furlong pole, but could not gain on the leader. GREY WAVE raced two wide in the tracking flight, was pushed along still two wide on the far turn and driven
into the lane, could not mount a bid on the leader, and was outpaced in the final furlong for place. KENNEDY'S DAY chased between horses around the first
turn, inched forward between horses approaching the half, joined the tracking flight inside of GREY WAVE for the far turn run, was driven inside of that foe
approaching the turn for home, but flattened out in the lane. STING BEE chased three wide through the clubhouse turn and two wide down the backstretch,
lost ground in the five path on the far turn, and was no further threat in the stretch. HASH BROWN settled at the rear, was driven in the four to five path on
the far turn, and offered no bid. BLUES TOUCH broke inward and bumped ARRESTING, was hard urged for early position, tracked behind the leader
through the clubhouse turn, began to lose ground from the nine sixteenths, and had nothing further for the drive.
