LA GRANGE LADY set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, opened up and held for the win. MINDOFMYOWN raced in mid pack early,
advanced between rivals, was no match late and finished second best. SHEZA DANDY R F was unhurried early, went five wide into the turn and was evenly
late. I'M A DANCIN WHO stalked the early pace from the inside and was empty late. SHESAPACKINPUNCHES was void of any early speed, raced seven
wide out of the turn and never fired. SHESA GOLDIGGER was outrun early, went six wide into the turn and offered no late rally. NEW ADVENTURE
pressed the early pace, raced between rivals and faded.
