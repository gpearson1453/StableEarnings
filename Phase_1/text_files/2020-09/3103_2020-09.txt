Footnotes
SMOOTH TALKIN TOM checked while lacking room behind rivals past the seven eighths pole, remained in contact, shifted out and rallied three wide to
make the lead entering the far turn, set the balance of the pace and won under strong handling. CREATIVE COURAGE close up near the inside, shifted out
to the eight pat in the stretch, dug in late and got up for second. SUN BROWN was bumped then squeezed at the start, outrun early, swung out to the
middle of the racetrack and closed determinedly through the stretch. ROBERT'S PRINCE dueled for the early lead along the inside, dropped back, checked
midway on the far turn then came on again late. CLYDE PARK was bumped at the start, allowed to settle, loomed boldly four wide on the far turn then came
up empty in the final furlong. EXCLUSIVE REWARD failed to menace. GARDEN QUALITY was no threat. MASCHERATO contested the lead two wide then
along the inside into the second turn and was used up. ARTAKSEZ was bumped at the start then never close. MO TRAMP bore out at the start causing a
chain reaction of bumping to his outside, matched strides for the lead three then two wide for four and one half furlongs then stopped. MY DISCRETION

Footnotes
HICKORY HILL battled for the early lead along the inside, shook clear on the turn then widened the balance of the trip under a strong hand ride to win as
much the best. LOVEATTURKEYCLUB void of early speed, circled rivals four wide through the stretch and finished clear for second. TEMPLE MOUNT
broke in front, contested the early lead three wide, chased the winner into the stretch then lacked the needed response. DOCTOR LEE failed to menace.
GREG RULES DA prompted the early pace between horses two wide, had speed into the stretch then weakened. SLANTED TRUTH had brief speed.

Footnotes
FLUGEL BINDER chased the pace from the inside into the turn, shifted out past the quart pole, rallied to make the lead at the top of the stretch and finished
full of run to win going away under a hand ride. AWESOME MACHINE sprinted to the lead soon after the start, shook clear on the turn, set the pace to the
top of the stretch then was no match for the winner. YACHT inside, went evenly. LETSBEGREATAGAIN reared at the start, rushed past rivals before a
quarter then also went evenly. VAL'S DISTINCTION passed tiring rivals. PAOLA'S TEAM had brief speed. AND I KNOW was outrun.
