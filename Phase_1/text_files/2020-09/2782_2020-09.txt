Footnotes
SAINTSATION stalked the leader from outside her flank, inched closer into the turn to bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, vied before kicking clear in
upper stretch, then drew off under driving pressure. FINANCIAL ONE was off a bit slowly, stalked from midpack inside of foes while in the two path, chased
from behind the leaders turning for home, shifted to the four path as the eventual winner kicked away, then stayed on through the final furlong to prevail over
CHEWY CHEWY GOOD for place. CHEWY CHEWY GOOD tracked from midpack four wide, shifted three wide while inching closer turning for home to
produce a bid at the quarter pole, but chased SAINTSATION through the lane as that foe kicked away, then lost place inside the final sixteenth. APRIL IN
PARIS set the pace along the inside, felt pressure from SAINTSATION into the turn, then was headed by that foe at the quarter pole, and gave way.
GLAMOUR GIRL raced far off the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path approaching the five sixteenths pole, then four wide turning for home, and
stayed on mildly. SOVEREIGN APPEAL was bumped by an inner foe at the start, tracked form midpack two wide and between horses, but weakened while
taking back from tight quarters at the five sixteenths pole. WHISPERING PINES was off slowly, trailed the field in the four path into the turn, advanced subtly
while shifting five wide turning for home, but failed to threaten before flattening out and weakening. NORMA JEAN B. was brushed by an inner foe at the
start, raced far off of the pace in the three to five path around the turn, and failed to factor, and bled. POWER OF MAGIC broke outwardly, stalked three
wide, then weakened between horses while shifting two wide at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
SALTY AS CAN BE bumped with ROCK STAR PARKING at the start, was quickly into stride and tracked 4w, moved up to engage the leaders inside the
three-sixteenths and was fully extended to narrowly prevail. AMUSING ANTICS tracked three wide, forged a narrow lead entering the stretch, dug in to meet
the bid of SALTY AS CAN BE a furlong out, fought hard but grudgingly gave in. LADY TRAVELER settled saving ground, moved up through the turn, angled
out entering the stretch and was making up ground. FARSIGHTED was allowed to settle, came four wide into the lane, angled out further and improved
position. SHIP IT broke slow, was unhurried into stride, rallied between horses but failed to threaten. SIANARA contended between horses to the final
furlong and faded. MALIBU BIRD pulled to contention along the inside, leveled into stride on the turn, but came up empty into the lane and faded.
DISTORTED VERVE saved ground to little avail. ROCK STAR PARKING came away slow, was bumped at the start and never recovered. AUNT JOIE
contended five wide for a half and dropped out. QUICK MUNNY was away alertly, set the pace along the inside, was collared midway through the turn,
relinquished the lead and steadied near the three-sixteenths pole and stopped.

Footnotes
MISS T TOO set a pressured pace two wide and between a pair of vying rivals, cleared an inner foe into the turn and held an advantage from an outer rival
around the turn, then responded to coaxing in upper stretch, produced a good kick to quickly clear from bidding foes, and widened under driving pressure.
PALOMITA prompted the pace setter three wide, then two wide around the turn, but proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, and held place between
horses through the lane under a long drive. OCEAN BREEZE tracked from midpack four wide, stalked the pace three wide around the turn, inched closer
turning for home to produce a bid for place in upper stretch as the leader kicked away, then failed to achieve that position through the lane, then just held
show from an inner rallying foe. SHE CAN'T SING saved ground around the turn off of the pace, shifted two wide in upper stretch and produced a mild kick
between foes, but found traffic when aiming to split foes passing the furlong pole, tipped inwards at the sixteenth pole and sustained her bid, but missed
place. MISTY BLUE pressed the pace along the inside, stalked from along the inside into the turn, but failed to keep pace with leading foes in upper stretch,
and subsequently tired. TIPSY GAL raced far off of the pace two wide early on, took the turn in the four path, and failed to factor. GOULDING raced
forwardly placed in the two path behind the leader, but failed to keep pace at the five sixteenths pole. IRISH WILLOW trailed throughout and never got
involved.

Footnotes
TRAVEL COLUMN tracked three wide, took over nearing the quarter pole, opened clear once straightened for the drive, was kept to task and held safely.
OFF WE GO was away in good order, angled in leaving the chute, set the pace along the inside, was unable to go on with the winner but boxed on well to
preserve the place. PRINCESS LEA settled in the second flight in hand, came four wide to make her bid and finished willingly to earn the minor award.
MEJTHAAM settled between runners, came four wide and improved position. GOOD WITH NUMBERS was forwardly placed between horses to the turn,
then three wide, but weakened in the final furlong and faded. FRONT STREET was hustled along on the inside in the second flight and failed to make
headway. HONORIFIQUE was hung wide and failed to threaten. THREE TIPSY CHIX saved ground to no avail. DRAMATIZER passed only the tiring ones.
AMICHE was allowed to settle, came six wide but failed to respond. RUNAWAY ROCKETTE showed little. MISS MALIBU broke a step slow and was never
a factor.

LASTING LEGACY came out at the start, tracked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch, was headed but
fought back gamely while drifting out under left handed urging and prevailed at the wire. HONEST MISCHIEF chased the pace early on, was in the five path
into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch, headed foe but was carried out late and gamely missed at the wire. STRIKE THAT came out at the start, set
the pace early on, was on the inside into the lane and yielded late in the stretch run. NITROUS stalked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and
flattened out late in the stretch drive. MUCHO chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch run. The rider of
HONEST MISCHIEF claimed an objection against the rider of LASTING LEGACY for interference along the stretch run and after review by the stewards

Footnotes
FLABBERGASTED set the pace inside of SENSE YOU LEFT while staying a path off of the inner rail, held an advantage as that foe bid turning for home,
repelled him at the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, then held under driving pressure. I HEAR YOU broke outwards and bothered foes, tracked
from midpack two wide, inched closer to stalk into the far turn, shifted three wide turning for home to engage the leaders, then sustained her rally through
the lane, but was fended off by the leaders. SICILIA (GB) shied from and inner foe and was pinched between horses at the start, saved ground around the
turns in midpack before swinging to the three then four path in upper stretch, outside of the leaders, but flopped back to her left lead at the sixteenth pole
and did not have enough to reach place. ELLA BRILLA was crowded at the start, saved ground far off of the pace, trailed around the far turn, shifted three
wide in upper stretch, then five wide at the furlong pole, and rallied late with a good kick for a minor reward. URBAN FAIRYTALE raced off of the pace two
wide around the first turn, saved ground around the far turn before shifting to the four path in midstretch, then stayed on without threatening. MORE GOOD
TIMES stalked the pace along the inside, but failed to produce a bid, chased and tired through the lane, then failed to return to the winner's circle to be
untacked and was vanned off. FIRST COURSE trailed the field, took the far turn in the three path while far off of the pace, then altered four to six wide in the
stretch without factoring. GOLD INCLUDED raced far off of the pace in the three path around both turns, but failed to factor. SHELLEY'S GEM raced far off
of the pace two wide and never got involved. SENSE YOU LEFT stalked two wide while being kept in the three path, produced a bid around the far turn, but
was repelled by the leader at the quarter pole, and weakened. SINGITA DREAMS raced off of the pace three wide, but failed to factor before weakening.
AUDREY'S TIME saved ground around both turns while off of the pace, and weakened.

Footnotes
SCONSIN was unhurried into stride, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, angled out entering the stretch, was full bore and caught the dueling
leaders a furlong out, shook off those two and drew away. FOUR GRACES contested the pace to the outside of MUNDAYE CALL into the stretch, was
unable to kick on with the winner but churned on for the place. NEVER FORGET brushed the gate and was away slow, settled saving ground, commenced
her advance through the turn, shifted out into the stretch and continued on willingly. MUNDAYE CALL disputed the pace toward the inside to the final furlong
and succumbed. EXTRA EFFORT was hustled along three wide, drifted out further leaving the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
BY MY STANDARDS prompted the pace two wide and between horses, forged a lead from his inner foe turning for home, shifted to the three path to meet
OWENDALE's bid, dug in gamely inside of that foe through the lane, then repelled him approaching the sixteenth pole and won going away. OWENDALE
stalked the pace three wide around both turns, produced a bid for the lead turning for home while shifting to the four path, dueled outside a game BY MY
STANDARDS while shifting to the five path through the lane,but was repelled by that foe approaching the sixteenth pole, then held place from an inner
surging rival. SILVER DUST took up off heels into the first turn due to lack of pace, tracked the pace two wide, but came under an all out drive passing the
three furlong pole, came into the lane in the four path and produced a rally between horses in the final furlong, but missed place. MCKINZIE lied close up to
the pace along the inside, got keen as the leader backed down the pace into the first turn, settled into the backstretch and stalked the pace, but came under
coaxing at the seven sixteenths pole, shifted to two wide in upper stretch while still inside of leading foes, attempted a bid inside of those foes at the furlong
pole, but lacked a closing kick and flattened out. TITLE READY trailed the short field in the four path around the first turn, saved ground spotting the field a
margin around the far turn, then produced a mild bid along the rail through the lane, lacked room passing the furlong pole, but failed to make an impact. MR
FREEZE broke well and set the pace along the inside, backed down the pace into the first turn causing foes to be stacked up, held an advantage inside of
the eventual winner down the backstretch and the far turn, but was headed by that foe at the quarter pole, offered little resistance and weakened.

Footnotes
MONOMOY GIRL came away a bit flatfooted, bumped with RISKY MANDATE into the first turn while working for position, tracked in the clear three deep,
reeled in the leader through the second turn, took over nearing the furlong marker, shook clear and held safely. LADY KATE opened clear and angled in to
set the pace, was unable to go on with champion MONOMOY GIRL through the final furlong but kept on well to hold the place. HOROLOGIST settled in
hand toward the inside, came under a ride leaving the second turn, angled out and finished willingly to earn the show. SARACOSA was allowed to settle,
was fanned out six wide leaving the second turn and improved position. VEXATIOUS settled along the inside, tipped out entering the stretch but failed to
make headway. SHE'S A JULIE was bumped going into the first turn, settled between rivals, was fanned out leaving the second turn but lacked a response.
WITH DIGNITY failed to respond. RISKY MANDATE broke a step slow, rushed up between horses, was jostled between rivals into the first turn, chased off
of the inside for six furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
DIAMOND OOPS saved ground far off of the pace around the turn, shifted off of the rail in upper stretch to pass the tiring early pace setter, produced a rail
rally through the lane after passing that foe, and surged inside of foes through the late stages to prevail. EXTRAVAGANT KID saved ground from midpack
around the turn, waited for racing room behind the leaders turning for home, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, rallied to bid at the furlong pole, forged
an advantage at that marker, but was outfinished by an inner surging foe. JUST MIGHT dueled for the lead two wide, forged and advantage turning for
home, but was failed to clear and was outkicked by an inner and an outer foe in the final furlong. CHAPS raced far off of the pace two to three wide around
the turn, rallied between horses in upper stretch, but ran up into traffic at the sixteenth pole, switched out and rallied willingly, but missed show. REAL
NEWS stalked along the inside, shifted two, then three,wide turning for home, produced a mild bid at the furlong pole, but was outkicked by an outer foe at
that marker. SMART REMARK raced off of the pace in the three to four path aorund the turn, but lacked racing room turning for home, then stayed on late
without threatening. CAROTARI bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked the pace three wide, but failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch.
JAZZY TIMES bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked from midpack two wide before being fanned seven wide between horses turning for home, and
lacked a rally. CHIEF CICATRIZ tracked from midpack five wide and outside of foes, fanned eight wide turning for home, but failed to get involved. TELL
YOUR DADDY raced off of the pace in the two path and never got involved. FIELDER chased the pace four wide under coaxing, but weakened in upper
stretch and was eased between rivals. WELLABLED dueled for the lead inside of JUST MIGHT, but weakened turning for home, and stopped through the
lane.
