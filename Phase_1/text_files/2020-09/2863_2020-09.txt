stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, rallied but just missed. DRINK IN MY HAND stalked the pace, closed late turn, rallied, moved
to the rail mid stretch and finished gamely. DIDDLEY led late backstretch, moved clear through the turn, was caught in deep stretch and weakened.
SINGANDCRYINDUBAI forced the pace. stalked from the rail on the turn then flattened out in the final furlong. OUR ZUMA settled off the pace, was hustled

Footnotes
GOOD TO ME pressed the pace, lapped onto the leader on the far turn, led into the stretch and drew clear then held sway under a drive. SAYSO raced in
mid pack, came four-wide through the clubhouse turn, was hustled three to five-wide on the far turn then finished gamely and prevailed for place. AUDREY
GRACE settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn then finished under a determined drive. DEE DEE'S ANGEL, off slowly, raced in
mid pack, chased three-wide on the far turn then evened out mid stretch. WHAT'S IN A KISS (IRE) settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn
but never reached contention. OUR EYES TOUCHED stalked the pace three-wide through the first turn, was hustled two-wide on the far turn but had no
response in the stretch. WILBURNRUBBER led quickly on what turned out to be a rail trip, set a pressured pace, was headed late turn and gave way upper
stretch.

Footnotes
ROYAL LASER pinched back at the start and settled three to two wide in mid pack around the first turn, advanced between rivals on the far turn to loom
outside the leaders as the field turned for home, wore down the pacesetter at the sixteenth pole and had a clear edge late. STRIKING MOON cleared to the
front early, throttled down, exchanged the lead with a rival in the backstretch and on the far turn, finally shaking that one off and opening up in upper stretch,
the winner immediately tackling him and grinding by at the sixteenth pole, but stayed on gamely to hold the place. MIRACLE SILVER was getting a perfect
rail trip behind the embattled leaders until suddenly steadying on the far turn, gathered up again to rally smartly down the stretch with good energy to get
into the show spot. MUSKOKA GIANT settled along the inside off pace, rallied into range on the far turn and continued to inch up down the lane for a minor
award. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION was four to two wide on the first turn off the pace, roused by his rider four to six wide on the far turn into the stretch and
continued to close down the lane, picking it up particularly well after changing leads at the seventy yard pole. LEAD DIRECTOR broke out at the start, came
up to duel with the early leader, exchanging the front end a few times with that foe before dropping back in upper stretch and tiring inside the final sixteenth.
CHAMPIT broke in at the start and was at the rear, continuing to trail around the far turn, only passing one tired foe down the lane. COLEYVILLE was a half
step slow and bumped at the start, rushed up to stalk the leaders three wide, came five wide late on the far turn but ran out of gas, drifting about down the
lane.

early lead, shook clear mid backstretch, set the pace, was under a strong drive through the stretch but was caught and passed in deep stretch. JUSTCALL
ME CANDY showed brief speed then pressed the pace, chased into the stretch but evened out in the final 16th. CHEEKYLICIOUS raced in mid pack,
chased three and four-wide on the turn then finished gamely. CHEETAHRA settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn then rallied belatedly. DONT GET
SMART settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the turn then flattened out in the late stages. ONEZY'S DREAM settled in mid pack, was hustled
two and three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. MUNNINGS BEACH moved up between rivals to press the pacesetter but dropped back to a
stalking position, faded along the rail on the turn and lacked a rally.
