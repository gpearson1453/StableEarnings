POINT was unhurried early and was no threat. WAR AT SUNRISE was no factor. WILKO FREEWAY wide early, was no menace. Z J WINS raced middle of
the pack early and faded in the stretch. ARTAKSEZ was outrun. SUPER FLEET raced wide early and was through after a half.

PRICEY APPEAL set the pace and dueled on the lead, lasted late, driving. EASTER PRIDE was well placed early, rallied in the stretch and finished willingly
in a good effort. CEE CEE'S GOT THIS stalked the pace three wide and went evenly late. JUDGE REESE raced middle of the pack and was no threat.
LEMON SLUSH was allowed to settle and failed to menace. HASTEY WAY stumbled at the start and was no factor. PERFECT DOLL contended early and
gave way in the stretch. JOHNS LOVELY LADY raced wide early, dropped back quickly and was eased around the turn and walked off.
