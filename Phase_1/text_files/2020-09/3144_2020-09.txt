Footnotes
R U LUCKY stayed close four wide to the top of the stretch, challenged outside rivals and drew clear through the late stages. SEMPER FI raced in striking
range three wide early, reached a short lead outside CAPTAIN D at the top of the stretch, could not match strides inside the winner entering the final furlong,
and just saved the place. MAKABIM advanced inside around the turn, paused briefly a quarter-mile out, got through on the rail to loom a threat in upper
stretch, and did not have enough. CAPTAIN D pressed MECHA CORTA from outside early, took over midway on the turn, stayed on to upper stretch and
weakened between horses. SCAR saved ground outrun early, moved out for the drive and gained without threatening. PURECRAZIDUDE was no factor
three wide. SAINT BENEVOLENCE raced two to three wide, and made no impact. INDY'S JEWEL raced widest throughout, and tired after a half-mile.
MECHA CORTA set the early pace near the inside, and gave way between horses after five furlongs.

Footnotes
SURPRISE ARRIVAL tracked outside the leaders three wide for a half-mile, took over outside FIERY PRINCESS turning for home under a drive, and drew
away geared down late. FIERY PRINCESS dueled inside TRULY AMBIRTIOUS early, won that battle by midway on the turn, was no match for the winner
after straightening away for the drive, but remained clear of the rest. TRINNI SUNSHINE steadied early between TRULY AMBITIOUS and RUN SNIP RUN.
moved up around the turn two then three wide, but could not sustain the rally. RACE THE STORM hesitated at the start and was far back early, moved out
approaching the stretch and improved position outside. G T'S BLUE SQUALL saved ground to no avail. TRULY AMBITIOUS vied early outside FIERY
PRINCESS, and gave way on the turn. DRILLZILLA faded in the four-path after a half. RUN SNIP RUN was finished early four wide.

Footnotes
ATAKAN set the pace slightly off the rail, was roused after five furlongs as VIOLENT FIGHT loomed to his outside, faced an inside challenge from MIKE IS
READY after six furlongs as well, battled through the stretch in close quarters between those two, and gamely prevailed. MIKE IS READY slipped through
on the rail to challenge inside the leaders turning for home, fought stubbornly through a long drive and just missed. VIOLENT FIGHT advanced three wide
around the turn, bid outside the top pair through the stretch, and came up just short. COMING UP ROSES was slow into stride, passed a couple of tired
horses after six furlongs, and was no threat with an even finish. AT THE BEACH was forwardly placed early between horses, and gave way on the turn.
GOLDEN V C prompted ATAKAN from outside early, faltered on the turn, and was eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
CAJUN COMMANDER chased after TRICK SHOT into the turn, took over from outside near the five-sixteenths, pulled clear into the stretch, drifted out late
and held on. BIG THORN advanced three wide coming off the turn, had aim outside CAJUN COMMANDER through the lane, did not have enough, and
saved the place. LITTLE DEMON was ridden along through the turn, and finished willingly inside the top two. BAILEY hesitated and banged the left side of
the gate coming out, moved out wide and could not reach contention. TRICK SHOT sped clear early, got overhauled by the winner before completing
three-eighths of a mile, and faded inside. MARSALA MONARCH saved ground and was outrun. CIRCUS broke awkwardly and steadied at the start, and
was far back throughout.

Footnotes
GEONOSIS saved ground in range early, moved off the inside approaching the stretch, challenged outside CREATE AGAIN through a long drive, and
narrowly prevailed. CREATE AGAIN vied inside SO LONG CHUCK early, shook clear on the turn, dug in when confronted by GEONOSIS into the lane, and
just missed in a game effort. DARDANELLOS raced three then four wide around the turn, and could not threaten with an even finish. SURF SHACK was
urged along past the half-mile pole, fanned five wide into the lane, and improved position while never a factor. CHASE RUNNER tracked outside the leaders
three wide, and faded in the stretch. ESPRESSO CALIENTE brushed the right side of the gate coming out, moved off the inside around the turn, and was
no menace. SO LONG CHUCK pressed CREATE AGAIN from outside early, and gave way on the turn. DIZZY GILLESPIE broke awkwardly at the back,
and was finished early.

Footnotes
NOBLE DRAMA gained rapidly in the three-path around the turn, took over outside JACKSON coming to the quarter-pole, drew well clear through upper
stretch, and was all out to preserve the decision. GARTER AND TIE was ridden along around the turn four wide, finished determinedly and was narrowing
the gap outside the winner. JUST KIDDING chased outside JACKSON to the turn, gave way after five-eighths of a mile, then ran on for a share well behind
the top two. SQUEEZADIOS saved ground early, and could not reach contention approaching the stretch in the two-path. JACKSON sped clear inside
through a sharp pace, could not handle NOBLE DRAMA late on the turn, and tired through the stretch on his left lead. TURN ON THE MAGIC stayed in
range early two wide, and gave way before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
OMAHA CITY advanced three wide approaching the stretch, rallied into the final furlong outside the leaders, caught BIG DADDY DAVE a sixteenth out, and
edged away while lugging in. BIG DADDY DAVE broke out, recovered to a forward position, took over outside JUST RIGHT MIKE early on the turn, moved
inside fending off pressure from SWAGGY GEORGE after three furlongs, went clear through the furlong grounds, and ran on with good courage. HALL
RICH LEGACY settled in the two-path around the turn, was boxed in a bit inside rivals through upper stretch, and finished one-paced when clear.
DESIGNED BY KITTEN was close up inside early, brushed the rail and dropped back entering the turn, was steered outside SWAGGY GEORGE in deep
stretch, and overhauled that rival despite taking an awkward step near the finish. SWAGGY GEORGE broke awkwardly and was off behind the field, moved
up around the turn four then three wide, challenged outside BIG DADDY DAVE into the stretch, but weakened through the last eighth of a mile. ESPIA was
outrun three wide. CASALSA got out badly through the turn, and was eased up in the stretch. JUST RIGHT MIKE led early inside, dropped back midway on
the turn, took a bad step past the quarter-pole with the rider lunging forward out of the irons, was pulled up in mid stretch and escorted off. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE TURN BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
PRINCESS SECRET was pushed out at the start by ALLURAMORE, advanced four wide after a half-mile, ranged up outside RESTOFTHESTORY late on
the far turn, dueled outside that rival through a long drive and prevailed narrowly. RESTOFTHESTORY took command with a sharp start, rated along clear
to the far turn, responded when hooked by PRINCESS SECRET outside the quarter-pole, and fought gamely on the rail to the finish. BIG RINGS saved
ground forwardly placed to the stretch, and lacked a solid closing bid. GO JO JO GO settled in the middle of the field up the backstretch, came three wide
off the turn, and made no appreciable headway through the lane on the far outside. FREAK was bumped by SPLASH CASH at the start, raced four wide
much of the way, and lacked a final rally. ALLURAMORE broke out, prompted the pace outside RESTOFTHESTORY for six furlongs, and tired. TAMIAMI
broke out, raced three wide and made no impact. LILAC LACE was shut off at the start behind PRINCESS SECRET, and was never prominent. SPLASH
CASH hit the left side of the gate and bumped FREAK at the start, went five wide into the first turn, prompted the pace to the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
POPPY'S PRIDE sped to the front early, fended off pressure from RAISON D'AIR and FULMINI, and held firm inside. FULMINI chased after the winner
three wide, could not seriously menace through the lane, and was clearly second best. CASTLE KING was outrun early, found his best stride belatedly, and
was just up for the show between horses. RAISON D'AIR moved up after breaking a step slow, pressed POPPY'S PRIDE from between horses, and gave
way approaching the stretch. TOP BOSS was ridden along unable to gain four wide midway on the turn, moved inside through upper stretch, and tired.
KICKS ON SIXTY SIX raced three wide, and was finished after a half-mile. OXBOW PIONEER was through early inside. MISTER LEONARDO dropped far
back early. CATCHING FISH stopped after a half. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
BOCA BOY broke outward, grabbed the lead outside BREEZE ON BY three wide into the first turn, moved inside setting an even pace up the backstretch,
shook off GATSBY after six furlongs, drifted out in the stretch but had enough to stay clear all out. BREEZE ON BY broke alertly but was beaten to the top
by BOCA BOY and placed under a firm hold midway on the first turn, lost some position with horses all around him up the backstretch, came clear into the
far turn and was ridden along four wide, advanced getting closest to the leader turning for home, neglected to change leads until the final strides and came
up second best. SEAZAN was four wide early, entered the stretch six or seven wide, and was up for the show on the far outside near the finish. GATSBY
raced forwardly two to three wide, and lacked the needed late response. HERCULES bumped with THE RED MAN at the start, pressed the pace outside,
and faded after six furlongs. SOCIAL EQUALITY hesitated at the start, bobbled a stride out, and was no factor toward the inside. CHESS'S DREAM broke
out, was keyed up early inside, and was through before reaching the stretch. HONESTO lacked room behind BOCA BOY and THE RED MAN and steadied
back at the start, dropped far back into the far turn, and was eased up in the stretch. THE RED MAN took the worst of a bump with HERCULES and was off
slowly, dropped far back after six furlongs, and was eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
QUINOA TIFAH popped clear soon after the start, rated along inside to the stretch, and was driving to stay in command. CON LIMA got bumped in the hind
end by VIBURNUM at the start, chased outside the winner throughout, and held the place. HAPPY CONSTITUTION pursued the leaders three wide from
the outset, and ran on willingly to be well clear of the others. BATTLE CRY moved out widest for the drive, and could not gain. MARVELOUS MARLENE got
bumped hard by CAN'T BUY LOVE and steadied sharply at the start, raced four wide and could not reach contention. MASHUGANA tired after a half-mile
three wide. VIBURNUM got slammed by SPECIAL INCLUSION, bumped into CON LIMA and took up at the break, and raced far back. CAN'T BUY LOVE
veered out slamming into MARVELOUS MARLENE at the start, stayed close inside to the turn, and was through after a half. SPECIAL INCLUSION veered
in smashing into VIBURNUM at the start, and was finished early. ROMANTICAL NOTE ducked in and was taken up to avoid hitting the rail at the start,
never made contact with the field, and jogged in far behind.
