Footnotes
SWEETNESSNCHARM led early, quickened in upper stretch under steady handling and was clear late under mild urging. ROLLIN MY OWN tracked the
winner all the way but was left behind by the winner late while keeping second. PLATE IT UP stalked from third, lost position in upper stretch and made a
good re-rally to retake the show spot. JEDI TEMPLE stayed toward the rear, was asked on the turn and responded, took the inside down the stretch to
threaten for a share but leveled out late. NAMBITI chased to the turn from off the pace and never threatened. JACK SPARROW was last after the start and
stayed there.

WHAT A RUMOR tracked leader to the turn, roused sharply into the stretch to run past the leader in the stretch in a good effort. ROCK STAR LADY saved
ground throughout, lost ground into the turn, angled out for the drive to gain the place spot. RUN BUBBA RUN no speed from outside throughout and ran on
willingly through the stretch for show spot. MYMONSTERSFORREAL had a tardy start, rushed to the lead inside, held to quarter pole but was used yo and
came up empty. TIDE RISING was bothered at the start, raced along inside with no late kick when needed in the drive on the rail. YOU'RE MY BOY BLUE
good position off rail to quarter pole with nothing left in the drive. TAP THE TOWN raced between horses to the turn with no late response. IS SHE QUICK
never a menace throughout.

SWING WEST prompted the leader while well clear of the rest of the field, quickly got to a clear lead on the turn and stayed safe. MR ZYDECO was well off
the pace, pushed along in the five path on the turn, responded well to steadily advance and was urged in deep stretch to nail a foe late for the place.
CHEAP SHOT tracked unhurried from a well back third, gained second on the turn, held that position in the sttretch, briefly threw a head in upper stretch
and was nailed late for place. WHO'SYOURFAVORITE raced last and improved position in the stretch. BOASTFUL DENIAL had an inside trip, was no real
threat and flattened out in the stretch. SKATINGONTHINICE led inside to the turn and had a steady fade.

SOLE FACTOR rallied from off the pace in the three path on the turn and advanced to cruise past the leader at the eighth pole. LOVE YOU GOODBYE
broke sharply, led to mid stretch, was all out but leveled, settling for second. TICKET OUT came away last, was asked on the turn and improved position in
the stretch. K FOR KATHY was unhurried inside, got left behind by the leaders on the turn and had a mild gain in upper stretch. CACKI chased a clear
leader and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
GRIZABELLA was up close while inside amongst foes, waited for the turn into the stretch for room, angled out to split horses and led past the sixteenth
pole. LEONA'S REWARD led inside to the stretch and was under pressure late but could not contain the winner. BIRDACIOUS was bumped at the start,
layed just off the leaders, raced in the three path on the turn, was bumped at the head of the stretch in the five path, had pace late but only to hold the show
position. TING TANG took closer order into the turn, rode the rail into the stretch, lost the whip at the eighth pole and lost position late. EDGE OF NIGHT
was bumped at the start, advanced in the four path on the far turn from mid pack, angled in and then out for room in the stretch and improved position late.
CARLY'S FLIGHT was near the back of the field inside and no threat. DIVA POWER contended up front to the top of the stretch, bumped a horse and faded
late.

Footnotes
COUNTRY DREAMIN outbroke rider, slow into stride, rushed inside to the turn, angled out and stride clear under strong hand urging with no whip needed in
a good effort. CURIOUS RUTH chased leader to the turn but proved no match for winner while clearly best of the rest today. ROSEBUD'S TIGER sprinted
clear to the turn but gave way grudgingly through the stretch to garner the third spot. FANCY FOX raced back to the stretch but leveled off in the stretch run.
IVY O'DAY broke a bit tardy, rushed inside to the turn while used up and faded back. JIMA'S GOLD slow to begin outside and never reached contention.
PROM THEME never factored. LIL POM POM tried to keep to the turn but gave way readily in the stretch run. MOUNT EAGLE never close.
