Footnotes
SEAT OF HONOR allowed to settle inside, angled out advancing on the final turn and drew away while taken in hand late. STORMY JUSTIN alternated for
the lead outside, moved clear midway on the turn and was no match for the winner. WINDOW TABLE well placed behind the pacesetters, moved wide into
the stretch and offered a mild bid. SUNSHINE WILD lacked speed, rallied closer near the quarter pole then flattened out. ZIPPED CODE chased wide,
faded on the final turn and was no factor. HIGH FLYING GUY saved ground well behind and was never in contention. NAP LAJOIE dueled for the front
inside then stopped after five furlongs.

Footnotes
MIGHTY ELECTRICA came out leaving the gate, drifted in and bumped with Play By Play on the backstretch, stalked, took the lead near quarter pole and
drew off fully extended. MISSING HOOVER set the pace in the three path but proved no match. ROSIE SUMMER, bumped leaving the gate, raced very
wide and was no factor. SYMPHONY OF LOVE bobbled and came in leaving gate, was three wide early, moved out very wide and failed to menace.
LEFTATTHEALTAR saved ground and tired. PLAY BY PLAY came out on the backstretch and contributed to the bumping with the winner, raced between
foes then tired. DILLY DEDALUS was fanned out leaving the gate then showed nothing.

Footnotes
EPIC (ARG) reserved well back inside, rallied into the stretch, and outfinished several challenges to get up in the final yards. GOLDEN SPEAR saved
ground early, advanced outside in the stretch and closed well too late. MINISTER'S STRIKE trailed for half a mile inside then found best stride too late.
CLOONTIA led early, opened a long advantage on the final turn but shortened stride in the stretch. TRILOGY lunged a bit at the start, raced off the pace
and faltered. NIKO STRONG pursued the pacesetter to the stretch then proved empty. GOTTA GET AWAY chased outside and lacked a rally. K D'S CAT
BIRD dropped back early and was never in contention. JACKS A WARRIOR was urged inside just off the leaders then gave way readily. DON CAMILLO
lagged far behind throughout.

I'M THIRSTY, just off the rail, raced very wide into stretch, took the lead in deep stretch and edged away. LITTLE NECK saved ground early, split foes then
went three wide into stretch, challenged deep stretch but then was no match. ENIGMATICA set the pace inside, extended while drifting out and weakened.
LIVIN A DREAM, three wide dueling for command, fell back leaving the turn. DANCINGTHEHNYDAWAY, between foes, challenged on the turn then
flattened out. KNOCK OUT KID, very wide, came up empty. RISQUE EXPRESS, wide, failed to menace. CHANCEE was two wide and just off the early
pace, stopped.

Footnotes
THE DUSTMAN dueled outside, took over into the stretch, edged away and remained safe while kept to a drive. CANTSTOPRUNNING chased inside then
rallied in the stretch closing the gap too late. JOE THE BOSS lacked speed, advanced outside with good late energy. STAR LUCK eased back behind the
dueling leaders early and continued willingly. DYNAMIC DYNASTY angled inside after an alert break, dueled to the stretch and yielded. MORE THUNDER
settled outside close up then flattened out through the stretch. DUCK DUCKY GOOSE saved ground and lacked a rally. REFI broke very slowly and was
never in contention. NOBLE ENDEAVOR dropped back after the start and was always far behind.

DUBROVSKY saved ground early, split foes on the far turn, drifted out through the stretch, and won going away. ECLIPSED MOON saved ground just off
the pace, moved out in the stretch and was gaining. WOODBURY just off the rail, between foes, lead, clear, weakened. MASS APPEAL broke slowly then
was steered to the rail, was outrun, moved out for the stretch run but was too late. AMI'S ARTIE, outside and just off the pace, tired. DON POLO, just off the
rail setting the early pace, had little left. IMPERIAL BREW failed to threaten.

Footnotes
LITTLE MAZZY settled close up outside, bid into the stretch, hooked the pacesetter and edged away holding off outside opponent. OVERBOLD prompted
the pace inside, vied through the final turn and finished gamely. DRAMATIZED raced close up outside, faded on the final turn then came again for the show.
SPIDER JORGENSEN reserved early, bid before half a mile then flattened out. BARREL OF STOUT broke slowly and raced far back then offered some
late energy. THE COTSWOLD WASP (GB) set a clear pace, was collared on the final turn and weakened. FANTASIZE lacked speed and was never in
contention. TU EXAGERES dropped back early and faded steadily. TRAFFIC TROUBLE dropped well behind, moved briefly closer on the final turn and
faded.

Footnotes
COLLOQUIUM was in tight entering the first turn, prompted the early pace from the outside, took oveer and opened a long lead and won under pressure.
CAT GIUMARELLO, racing just off the rail setting the early pace, was no match but held. PECAN PATTIE, three wide early, was very wide on the final turn
and had some late gain. ARIMA, eased back and steered wide in tight entering the first turn, remained wide and failed to menace. QUIET PLEASE had only
brief speed. GIRARDI saved ground and tired. SHANGHAISWEETHEART, outside and just off the pace, stopped.

Footnotes
QUARKY dueled along the inside throughout and edged ahead in the final yards following a race-long battle. RAILMASTER vied three then two wide with a
narrow lead and held on gamely to the finish just missing. WHERE YOU WAS lacked speed, saved ground to the stretch, angled out and rallied. TALLY MO
forced the pace between rivals down the backstretch, faded on the turn but continued willingly. HAY BOY chased outside, moved wide in the stretch with a
willing finish. FIVE MORE MINUTES hustled off the pace inside and proved empty in the stretch. GILDED WARRIOR lacked speed and was never a factor.
RAGGY ROCKS dropped back after the start and was always outrun. EL DULZURA trailed throughout losing contact with his field.
