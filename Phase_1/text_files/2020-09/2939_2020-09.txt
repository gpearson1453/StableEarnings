QUARTER SAWN broke alertly, responded to pressure into the stretch and held on in multi horse scramble for the wire. DOUBLE CRUISE bumped leaving,
closed quickly late stretch and narrowly missed. SPEEDY RAE bobbled just after the break and rallied determinedly between rivals to earn show.
TIMBERGOLD away well, rallied at the head of the stretch and was narrowly denied in the final yards. IVORY FAME closed outside late. SASSES LOKI
broke inward bumping DOUBLE CRUISE and lacked a closing response. ROLLING TIMBER drifted in at the head of the stretch then steadied and yielded.

Footnotes
WALKTHELINE quickly took command, was asked to quicken approaching the quarter pole and stayed clear under light handling. IGNITE THE MOON
angled in entering the opening turn, moved up menacingly at the five sixteenth pole, was all out into the stretch but was no match for the winner and held
place. COLLAR ME FIRST saved ground through the turn, lodged a rail bid at the head of the stretch and but lacked closing response needed. LORD
STANLEY sat mid pack while three to four wide into the opening turn, drove four wide into the lane and lacked a kick. NOT YOUR BIZINESS brushed
approaching the first turn, chased and gave way. SALTY LITTLE DOG lugged out entering the opening turn brushing NOT YOUR BIZINESS, checked at the
three eighths marker and faded. JAZZY GIRL lacked early speed and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FLAT AS A PANCAKE sat just off the pace from the two path, angled out to the three path at the five sixteenth pole in pursuit of the lead, gained advantage
over EDGE OF OKOTOKS and drove clear. EDGE OF OKOTOKS hustled to the front, dueled for the pace outside of ROYAL STATUS through the
backstretch, moved clear of that one then was quickly under pressure approaching the quarter pole, rallied inside then gave way grudgingly late. LIL OL
FLATTER reared hitting the gate away, was distanced through the backstretch, closed the gap through the far turn, swung out into the lane, improved
position into the stretch but was no match for the leaders and finished best of rest. ROYAL STATUS contested the early pace inside, pressed the issue into
the far turn, was unable to move on with rival from the quarter pole and wilted. EVERYTHING'S QUIET allowed to settle just off the pace outside and retired
early. TALA never reached contention. *STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving LIL OL FLATTER but
made no change after review. LIL OL FLATTER reared leaving and was deemed to had a fair start.

Footnotes
TRIPLE LIVE sat in striking position while three wide, moved up alongside KICKEN WEST G. at the three eighths marker then gained the lead on the final
turn, was roused into the lane then drifted out under left handed urging then continued to drift further out at the top of the stretch then prevailed under a long
hard drive. STEELFORCE settled four wide from mid pack, took closer order leaving the backstretch, lugged in leaving the final turn, rallied between rivals
through the stretch brushing BARLEY BOY and inched clear for place. SMILEY raced near the back of the pack, shifted out after the half, took closer order
outside, steadied after losing path at the head of the stretch then re-rallied late to earn show honors. BARLEY BOY saved ground under a snug hold inside,
angled out approaching the quarter pole, lodged an all out bid inside into the stretch, exchanged brushes inside of STEELFORCE and was weakened late.
SMALL TOWN DUDE sat in range from the three path, lodged a mild bid into the lane and failed to threaten. TUXEDO MASK under a strong hold leaving
the opening turn, saved ground and was done early. KICKEN WEST G. well rated through the backstretch, was overtaken at the five sixteenth pole and
faltered. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of SMILEY against the rider of TRIPLE LIVE alleging interference into the stretch run was
upheld after review. TRIPLE LIVE was disqualified and placed third for interference to SMILEY.

Footnotes
CHASKA settled in stride early then was reserved off the quick pace through the backstretch, swept the lead at the quarter pole then was under steady
pressure and just held under a late drive. PORT PROTECTION saved ground mid pack, took closer order leaving the final turn then was put to a drive,
responded to mild urging then angled out mid stretch, closed with every stride and narrowly missed. HALLIE'S HERO reserved off the pacesetters while
three to four wide, came under coaxing into the final turn, ranged up four wide and flattened out through the drive. EDDYSHAK raced near the back, bid five
wide at the quarter pole but could not improve position through the drive. GEM ALTA steadied slightly entering the opening turn, gained ground leaving the
backstretch and lacked a closing response. LONE PIONEER lost ground leaving the opening turn and never reached contention. TAP MASTER set a fast
pace, was used up then gave way.

Footnotes
ZBIG chased the pace from the three path, inherited the lead at the five sixteenth marker, drew clear into the lane and was steadily handled to draw away.
SHADY BIZ chased wide through the backstretch, gained closer order through the far turn then was roused into the lane, chased through the stretch
improving position but was no match for winner. PADDYSDAYCHARM settled just off the early pace, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, chased
ZBIG into the lane and weakened late stretch. OSO BRAVE raced in second flight and offered a late mild rally. COZY CAPER quickly sped to the front, was
under pressure leaving the backstretch then was quickly overtaken and tired. GROOMED sat just off the pace in the two path, dropped back leaving the
backstretch and failed to menace in the drive. FROST CANYON lacked a serious bid. HOLY OR NOT saved inside early and was outrun late.

Footnotes
FROBISHER BAY tracked outside, went five wide into the far turn, angled towards the rail at the head of the lane, rallied steadily gaining the lead mid
stretch and won driving. OJO DEL MAR contested the early pace inside of AURORA D'ORO, continued a duel through the far turn, disposed of rival at the
quarter pole, was showing signs of tiring into the stretch and was caught late. LOOKIECOOKIE stalked the dueling pacesetters while three wide, drove three
wide coming off the final turn but was out finished. LONG TIME DON tracked four wide through the opening stages, rallied evenly and was not able to
improve position through the drive. CAPITALISM lacked a serious bid. SYNNIN trailed field and offered a late mild bid. OIL CHANGE offered little. AURORA
D'ORO away well, contended the early pace outside of OJO DEL MAR, dueled in the far turn but was not able to move on with the fore mentioned and
faltered.

Footnotes
DOUBLE BEAR rated from well off the pace, gained ground quickly on the leader into the final turn, swept to the front at the top of the stretch and won going
away. WATER WAGON trailed the field early, advanced outside through the backstretch then went in pursuit of the leaders from the quarter pole, improve
position mid stretch but was no match for the winner. RAIDEN allowed to settle early while four wide, chased through the stretch and passed tiring rival late.
REFLECTIONOFVALUES sprinted clear of the field early, widened to good margins through the backstretch then saw them diminish quickly from the
quarter pole, was overtaken with a furlong remaining and faded at the rail. GO WILD saved ground from just off the rail and showed a mild interest late.
TIMELESS TALES raced near the back, chased hard while four wide through the far turn and flattened out in the drive. NEVER EVEREVER saved to no
avail. HUERFANO G. raced in closest pursuit and was done early. RAYREADY pulled up in the backstretch, did not finished and walked off.

Footnotes
PRINCESS PONTI prompted the pace while four wide, dueled through the far turn outside CLASSIC TARTAN, drew clear into the stretch and was kept
under light handling. SECRET PROPOSAL gained closer order leaving the backstretch, closed gradually through the stretch and got up for place. CLASSIC
TARTAN set a pressed pace while three wide off the rail, responded to challenge from PRINCESS PONTI, was unable to sustain the bid that was needed
into the lane and was rundown late for place. CAGEY settled four wide, waited for running room approaching the quarter pole and uncoiled a late inside bid
but was in vain. SOPHIE MCTROPHY chased the early pacesetters from the two path, lodged a bid into the stretch and flattened. HI DREAMIN failed to
menace. INBETWEEN US chased throughout. DANCINONASTAR always outrun. SMOKE N' CHROME tracked inside early and tired into the stretch.
SEDITION raced wide through the backstretch, chased hard through the far turn then stopped at the quarter pole, was eased and was reported by the
Official Veterinarian as having bled.

REBATE SHOP attended the pace while three wide, gained an advantage into the lane and turned back challenge from NO COLLUSION digging in late. NO
COLLUSION sat just off the pace inside, steadied entering the far turn losing ground, chased in close quarters with a furlong remaining, gained a short
advantage mid stretch and was bested late. EMERALD CANYON sat in striking distance outside, drifted out brushing MYCANDY leaving the backstretch,
fanned three wide through the turn, but lacked the kick that was needed. TELL ME TALES raced from the back of the pack, fanned four wide entering the far
turn and lacked a closing response. LETTUCE sent for speed, was hard using vying and had nothing left for the drive. SALTY O'DAY back of pack and
failed to menace. NORTHERN STRYKER outrun throughout. MYCANDY broke outward, was brushed leaving the backstretch, pressed the issue while four
wide at the three eighths pole and tired. BALMONT CHOCOLATE crossed over quickly to pressed the early pace from the four path and retired early.
