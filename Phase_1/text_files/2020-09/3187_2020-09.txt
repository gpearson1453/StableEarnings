Footnotes
MOON'S IMAGE trailed on the first turn, stalked the pace from off the rail while getting closer, advanced on the far turn, lacked room and angled out
entering the stretch, kept busy with the reins down the stretch and passed the leaders late for the win. MONEY PIT was gapped off the pace early, moved
up on the turn, battled a foe down the lane and exchanged bumps as both were passed by the winner late. STERLING JUDGE led in the first turn, backed
off and tracked a foe, led again into the stretch and battled another foe, exchanged bumps, led late but settled for third deep. CUP GAME was bumped at
the start, got through a tight opening at the rail on the backstretch, chased the pace on the far turn but needed more in late stretch. CHEROKEE HAWK
bumped a foe at the start, led up the backstretch but lacked a rally on the far turn. DRASTIC MEASURES quit after a quarter.

Footnotes
SECRET FORMULA waited, rallied on the turn, was fanned wide into the stretch and outpaced the leading foes late. MAYBETHEDAY was bumped at the
start, last into the turn, had a ground saving trip and got closer, was near the lead midway down the lane but settled for second. WILD COWGIRL led to the
final furlong and could not keep pace late. SUMMIT POINT tracked behind the leader, pressed outside of that foe on the turn, stayed close to mid stretch but
came up short late. FANCY KELLY bumped a horse at the start, chased in the five path on the turn to move up but faltered late down the lane. MY PINK
BABY BIRD was sandwiched at the start, stayed involved to mid stretch and faded. PATTI GO GIRL was bumped at the start, mid pack early, angled out
very wide in the stretch and posed no threat from there. MIDNIGHT STROLLYNN raced mid pack to the turn and came up empty.

JERRID followed the leader in hand to the turn, moved up to vie for the lead to deep stretch and got clear close to the wire. ECRU showed reserved speed
at the rail, was headed on the turn and vied with that foe to deep stretch but yielded nearing the finish. OVERZEALOUS brushed a foe at the start, chased
the leader, took the five path on the turn and had late run to hold the show. ESCALERA was last early, raced wide in the five path on the backstretch, rallied
on the turn and entered the stretch six wide but flattened out at the eighth pole. EL RUBIO tracked from inside, dropped back on the far turn and had some
rally left in the stretch. BIG LEMON brushed a horse at the start, was close up to the turn, dropped back and raced a bit erratic in the stretch.

PROM THEME was well back early, came into the stretch in the five path, had the best run from the three sixteenths pole and was edging up on the winner
but missed. CORA ANNE raced evenly, had a mild late rally and improved position. OLDFASHIONED ANGEL was quick to the front, got clear of a foe
applying pressure early, was headed by the winner on the turn, dueled that one to the final furlong and gave way. CURIOUS RUTH briefly pressed the
leader, stalked from inside to the stretch and leveled out late. MOUNT EAGLE was no threat.

HER GOLD MINE chased from off the pace, headed the leader on the far turn, led, was clear down the stretch and lasted late for the win. NESSUM
DORMA veered in at the start, stayed well back to the stretch, was fanned widest and closed best, edging up on the winner at the finish. QUIET DAWN was
restrained a bit while in third early, chased the leader on the far turn and got up to second in mid stretch but settled for third at the finish. DIXIE MOLL
waited, chased closer to the pace on the far turn while in the four path and improved position in the stretch. MALICED tracked inside, raced evenly to the
stretch, rallied up the rail and faltered in the last furlong. PORTRAIT OF EMMA was no threat. LADY MADISON (IRE) was in front and clear to the far turn
while inside, dropped back there and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHEZA POP STAR bumped a horse at the start, was off the pace, angled outside foes entering the turn to move up in the three path, led there and cleared
off mid stretch. JUST ZOEY bumped a horse at the start, was pinched off shortly after the start, always stayed off the pace and ran on steadily down the
lane to pass a tired foe for second. CONCORDSDIFFERENCE was up close,, rallied on the rail in the lane, held second midway but leveled out and settled
for third. AFLAXENDREAM was last to the turn and passed tired horses in the stretch to improve position. I'M DA BOSS chased on the rail up close to the
turn and backed off. MYSTIC MAGIC was bumped at the start with rider losing his irons, quickly recovered, raced off the pace, made a wide move on the
turn and faded in the stretch. SILENT VOLUME led to the turn and tired. EXPLODING LUCY chased from between horses, tired on the turn and drifted out
very wide in the stretch. The stewards made a general inquiry into the start of the race and made no changes.
