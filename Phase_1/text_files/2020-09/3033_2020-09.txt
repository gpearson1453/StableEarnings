TKOTCHKE stalked the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch under a long drive, edged past the leader and lasted at the
wire. SOUTHERN PASSAGE raced back early on, was off the rail into the lane, rallied down the lane and just missed at the wire. CLEARLY MAD tracked
the pace early, made a bid three wide into the lane, took over and inched clear near the eighth pole but gave in and lost place in the final stages. CAVATINA
pressed the pace early while two wide, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. PORTAL ONE was in the six path into the
lane and ran evenly throughout. LOOKIN FOR LOKI set the pace early from the inside, was off the rail into the lane and faltered in the stretch drive. KICK
SOME TALE broke slowly from the gate and trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
MISSPELL stalked two wide, tracked the leading duelers from the three path around the far turn before producing a bid while still in hand in upper stretch,
responded when let out a notch and edged clear passing the furlong pole, then held firm under confident handling to the wire. SARANYA saved ground from
midpack around the first turn before leaving the rail into the backstretch, tracked from the four path around the far turn before producing a rally in upper
stretch, but greenly flopped back to his left lead at the furlong pole as the leader edged clear, then stayed on to prove second best. PRINCESS THEOREM
stalked from the pocket around the turns, shifted to the three path while still behind the leaders through midstretch, then stayed on mildly between horses to
achieve show. CHIPSHIRE prompted the pace two wide, vied passing the half mile pole before forging an advantage in upper stretch, but was headed by an
outer foe at approaching the furlong pole, and yielded. RAPID WATER saved ground far off of the pace and rallied mildly inside of foes through the lane.
REGAL SONG pulled clear through the lane for the first time, got rank from restraint into the first turn, settled and held an advantage from CHIPSHIRE
around the far turn, but was headed by that foe and other rivals in upper stretch before weakening in the late stages. STAGE FRIGHT saved ground off of
the pace before tracking from midpack in the two path around the far turn, but failed to produce a bid and finished up evenly. LAURA'S ANGLE raced far off
of the pace two to three wide around the turns and never got invovled. LEIA ORGANA raced off of the pace three wide, and was outrun. KENTUCKY PRIDE
trailed the field in the two path around the first turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
LONELY PRIVATE cleared off leaving the chute, held a margin in hand down the backstretch before widening into the turn, the responded when asked in
upper stretch, and held safely under driving pressure. VICTORY BOULEVARD was off slowly and trailed the field down the backstretch, advanced in the
four to five path around the turn, bid for place at the furlong pole, and edged that position from an inner foe approaching the wire while not threatening the
leader. HOMBRAZO advanced in the four path into and around the turn to forge place passing the five sixteenths pole, held that position through midstretch
while chasing the clear leader, but was outfinished by an outer foe approaching the wire. HOP KAT raced forwardly placed in the two path while inside a pair
of foes around the turn, but weakened passing the quarter pole. CZECHMIGHT chased three wide, then from between horses around the turn, but
weakened turning for home. NEW EAGLE raced keenly behind horses while in the two path through the early stages, cut the corner turning for home, but
failed to factor. SAMURAI CAUSE tracked from midpack along the inside, but weakened at the three furlong pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
ROCKPAPERSCISSORS was forced inwards at the start by an outer foe, recovered to stalk the loose leader from the outside, was kept in the three path by
that foe while just off of his flank through the turn, produced a bid at the quarter pole and drew off passing the three sixteenths pole, then widened her
advantage under driving pressure before being geared down approaching the wire. ROOKERY raced off of the pace three wide into the turn, shifted to the
four path at the five sixteenths pole, and sustained a grinding rally through the lane to achieve place at the sixteenth pole, but was no threat to the leader.
EILEEN ALEXANDRA trailed the field early on, took the turn in the two to three path, swung to the five path turning for home, then stayed on past tiring foes
through the lane for a minor reward. PATTY H cleared the field early on, held a clear margin in the two path into and around the turn, but was headed by the
eventual winner at the three sixteenths pole, quickly proved no match for that foe, then weakened through the final furlong. GOOD PENNY broke inwards
and forced ROCKPAPERSCISSORS inwards as well, stalked the pace along the inside, saved ground around the turn, attempted a rail rally through upper
stretch, but failed to produce a bid, and got outfinished by outer foes for minor rewards. JAIL HOUSE CODE raced off of the pace inside of foes in the two
path around the turn, but failed to factor. DOTTIE tracked from midpack in the four path, but shifted down to the three path while weakening at the five
sixteenths pole, was done early, and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
GOLDEN CURL saved ground in midpack through the first turn, smoothly tipped to the two, then three path, around the far turn before bidding for the lead
outside of TIPSY GAL in upper stretch, forged an advantage from that foe at the furlong pole while hanging on her left lead, then switched to her right lead
approaching the sixteenth pole, and inched clear. TIPSY GAL stalked the loose leader two wide, inched closer turning for home to bid for the lead
approaching the quarter pole, forged an advantage in upper stretch while meeting GOLDEN CURL's bid, but was headed by that foe at the furlong pole, and
gave way. LOVING MOMENT trailed the field in the two to three path around the first turn, then advanced in the four to five path around the far turn, and
stayed on outside of foes to achieve show in the late stages. SIAMESE saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, advanced mildly three to four wide
around the far turn, but lacked a kick while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, forged show before changing to her right lead passing the furlong pole,
but was still outfinished by an outer foe for show. EDGEE ANGEL raced off of the pace in the two path, then in the three to four path around the far turn,
shifted in to attempt a rally in upper stretch, but failed to do so, and was no factor. DEPUTY DORA saved ground far off of the pace, came into the lane two
wide, and never got involved. REDEMPTION DAY was sent hard after a flat footed beginning, cleared the field while drifting to the three path into the first
turn, opened up entering the backstretch, but tired around the far turn, was headed at the quarter pole, and stopped through the lane. SAINTSATION
prompted the pace two wide into the first turn, cut down to the stalk from the rail as the leader opened up, stalked from the pocket around the far turn, but
failed to attempt to angle out turning for home, was blocked and shuffled behind the tiring pace setter through upper stretch, then shifted out inside the final
furlong, but lacked any interest.

Footnotes
ITS A WRAP tracked the leading duelers from the three path around the turn, produced a bid outside of those foes at the five sixteenths pole, forged a
narrow advantage from the game WAR DETONATOR at the furlong pole, and edged away from that foe under a long drive through the late stages. WAR
DETONATOR dueled for the lead two wide, forged an advantage while meeting ITS A WRAP's bid at the five sixteenths pole, dug in to cling to a lead in
upper stretch, but was headed by that foe at the furlong pole, then kept on through the final stages. RYE HUMOR tracked from midpack in the four path
around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch, then stayed on through the lane to secure show. TRIBULATION tracked from
midpack along the inside into the turn, shifted two to three wide and between horses at the five sixteenths pole while behind the leaders, but failed to keep
pace with those foes in upper stretch, and got outfinished for show. ON YOUR MARK broke outwards and was uncontrollable at the start, strongly bothered
DECISION MAKER and PERFECT SENSE in the process, then raced far off of the pace in the two path and passed tired foes. DECISION MAKER was
wiped out by an inner foe at the start, trailed along the inside, and passed tired foes along the rail through the lane. OAK ROOM stalked along the inside, but
weakened two wide at the quarter pole. PERFECT SENSE was bothered at the start by an inner uncontrollable rival, shifted from the five to three path while
far off off the pace into the turn, and failed to get involved. MONTE NE dueled for the lead along the inside, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole.
