BLESSED TWO forced the early pace, dueled on the turn and with the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. JOIN THE CLUB
stalked the early leaders and was a factor on the turn but with a bid from the four path in upper stretch was no match for the winner. CAMP NARDO set a
pressured pace and had a slim lead on the turn but gave way at the top of the stretch.

raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. MISSION CITY GIRL stalked from the inside but chased on the turn
and dropped back through the stretch.

MARRIAGE COUNSELOR stalked the leader from the inside, was roused on the turn and with a bid in mid stretch proved best. SOPHISTICATION was in
range, a factor on the turn and had the lead from the six path in mid stretch but was outgunned. GET MY GIST set the pace and had the lead on the turn but
from the five path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. NUPOGODI was in touch and had a mild gain on the turn but from the seven path at the top of
the stretch leveled off. LOVE THAT LUTE had no speed, trailed the field on the turn, was pulled up in mid stretch and walked off. SEAL TEAM TWO
stumbled at the start and lost the rider. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

STATION ROCK was unhurried early, gained ground on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was much the best. BUTTERFLY STRIKE
was in range and a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. YALLHAVEANICEDAY was hustled early
and had the lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was all out. PHIL IN THE BLANK was up close and roused on the turn but from
the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. FRONT NINE was hustled early and raced evenly on the turn but had no late kick.
LOKINFORPURSEMONEE was off the pace, moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch passed tired foes. COBILOCO was well
back and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. MILWAUKEE MAGIC had no speed and saved ground
on the turn but was not a factor. HARDY CANDY was in mid pack but chased on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch came up empty.

Footnotes
GIANT MINE showed speed and set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held sway. UNCLE GRUMPY
was in mid pack and in tight on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. BENS LAST CALL was up close and a factor on
the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch weakened. CONQUEST ELIMINATR showed no speed and had a mild gain on the far turn but
from the seven path at the top of the stretch leveled off. THE OTHER BREEZE was well back and closed the gap on the far turn but had no impact. HIGH
ROLLING DUDE stumbled at the start and chased on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was empty. WHO'S GOT IT stalked the
early leader and raced evenly on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE was off the pace and
saved ground on the far turn but was never in contention.

Footnotes
IT'SNICETOBENICE was in touch, moved up on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. JACK'S MEMORY was in
range, roused from the inside on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for place. FOREST LASS tracked the early leaders and
was a factor on the far turn but with the lead from the four path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. FLECK was well back, had a mild gain on the far turn
and finished well. SHOW ME THE PRIZE stalked the early leaders and raced evenly on the far turn but from the three path through the stretch needed
more. GLIB MARYLIN was in mid pack and hustled along on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch evened out. PRINCESS MORO was
off the pace, trailed the field on the far turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. BLONDILIKESTODANCE showed no speed and saved ground on the
far turn but had no rally. HEART RUSH forced the early pace and had a slim lead on the far turn but gave way at the top of the stretch. GYPSY JAZZ set a
pressured pace and dueled on the far turn but came up empty.

Footnotes
DYNA'S GAMBLE was in range, gained ground on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch drew clear. DEPUTY OF EGBERT showed speed
and set the pace, had the lead on the turn and held place. CAPE DESIDERATO showed no speed, had a mild gain on the turn and from the seven path at
the top of the stretch was up for show. A VIKING MORNING was in mid pack, hustled along on the turn and from the six path through the stretch was the
best of the rest. HEAD KITTEN tracked the early leaders from the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no
late kick. RADIO NOWHERE stalked the early leader and raced evenly on the turn but weakened through the stretch. GIANTBALLS OF FIRE was well
back, lacked room on the turn and had no impact. CHESTERMERE was in touch and roused on the turn but had no response. STONE KING was off the
pace and saved ground on the turn while outrun.
