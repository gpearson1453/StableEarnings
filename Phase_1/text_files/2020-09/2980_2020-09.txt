Footnotes
FLAT OUT FAST was unhurried to the far turn, followed a horse rallying past other horses, continued on to pass that foe and split horses late to get up in
the final jumps. HONDO GUSTO was taken back inside and last after the start, began a rally on the far turn circling horses and closing well in the lane but
settling for place late. EMPEROR'S GOLD was bumped at the start, showed speed outside a foe, responded to a challenge and got clear on the far turn,
was headed in the stretch and responded again to get clear but weakened late to settle for show. GIANT TRICK tracked just behind the leaders, headed
and then battled the lone leader in the stretch and weakened late. LIZZY'S LURE was bumped between horses at the start, raced between horses on the
backstretch and stayed even till late stretch holding postion while losing lengths. JENNYSREGALMAN bumped between horses at the start, vied inside a
foe nearing the far turn, stayed close to mid stretch and weakened. PRIMED FOR TALENT bumped a foe at the start, broke well despite that, tucked inside
mid pack, took closer order on the turn and backed up shortly after. PER OHIO STATE RACING COMMISSION RULING #2020-041, DATED 10/30/2020.
FLAT OUT FAST WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
RIGHT THE WRONG outbroke rider and bumped at the start, rushed to the lead, widened into the turn and held sway through the final furlong with good
handling. CAZMAN trailed to turn, launched a outside run for place while best of rest. RAF tried to keep up, stayed on well in the stretch run for show.
PRIME TIME broke sharp, rushed to keep up from inside with no late gain in the drive. MY PAL DAL tardy from the gate, off rail trip with no late punch.
BOOGIE MAN tardy start from inside, never a factor thereafter. AGGRO CRAG (IRE) outside speed to turn, gave way only to drop out of it in stretch.

Footnotes
CONGRUITY four wide first turn, three wide quarter pole, blew past into the stretch run and cleared off in the final furlong. PALTARREVENGE good start,
well placed inside, rallied past the quarter pole for the place spot. CIRCLE AWAY no speed to far turn, put to a drive widest into stretch while all out for the
third spot, up for third spot. ESCALERA no speed from inside to far turn, moved up from the turn and only improved in the stretch. SOLO DRINK broke
sharp, three wide first turn, settled in with a wide run on the far turn but came up empty. WILLIAM CROTTY hard pursuit to far turn while used up and
faltered back. PETE MARWICK good speed to front for a half and gave way readily thereafter from the rail. FRED'S COUNTRY BOY never threatened at
any call.

MY PINK BABY BIRD tracked the lead to the stretch and moved up the rail to get clear late for the win. MISS TREATED STAR vied outside a foe, led on the
turn, was passed late for the win and just lasted for place. CARLY'S FLIGHT waited, came wide on the turn, was edging closer at the end and just missed
second. QUEEN CITY KITTY made a five path move on the turn, re-rallied to get closer in the stretch but needed more late. TREASURE WILBURNYA had
a rail trip and improved position in the stretch. IT WILL HAPPEN chased just off the leader and tired in the stretch. NUTNBUTAROXSTAR was no threat.
GINGERMYSISTER vied inside to the turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
UGLY DUCKLING no speed inside to turn, roused into the stretch with a keen response and finished fastest to go clear in the final sixteenth. TIZ DEJA
BLUE sharp break outside, set pace to deep stretch but was overpowered in the late while no match. LINE OF GOLD chased leader to deep stretch, could
not go on and held show. ASHER'S MUSIC raced outside throughout, chased top pair from turn and stayed on willingly through the final furlong. MISTER
CARSON tardy start, rushed up rail, checked hard at the three eighths pole and leveled off in the stretch. DICEMAN tardy start from inside, far back to
stretch and only closed the gap late. CINCINN brief foot from gate but backed up quickly with no response. SNAPY TWELVES bobbled at the start while
never a threat thereafter. JUDGE HUDSON raced outside with no run. QUEEN'S PALACE was through early and dropped back.
