Footnotes
GRAND MAMOO broke in at the start, exchanging bumps with BLUEBIRD DAY, sprinted quickly to a clear lead, then drew off and lasted under steady
pressure. BLUEBIRD DAY bumped at the start, tracked the pace, angled out through the turn to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady
gain and missed. SUNNYMEDE DREAM allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and closed well for
the show. KELLY BE KRUSIN mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch and flattened out. MIMA'S MIRACLE
well placed and outside, lost some ground three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened in the drive. SUGAR BRITCHES lost her
path at the start, was allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path and had no rally. LIMON VOLADOR broke out at the
start, showed little. SHES A MAMA'S GIRL was a brief factor.

Footnotes
SURLY FURIOUS well placed and off the rail, looped to a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path gaining a clear lead into the
stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. THE PREDICAMENT set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then was no
match for the winner and held the place safe. KOBLA MAS allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the
lane and closed well for the show. FLIGHT TO PARADISE stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid
outside the leader into the stretch, weakened late and held a share. BOURBON BROWN rated inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside
of rivals into the stretch and weakened. CONGRATS SMOKE improved position. SEA CAPTAIN was a brief factor, outside. DANCER'S REVENGE was no
factor. PALACE INTRIGUE lost contact with the field and walked off.

Footnotes
ALFRED tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off late.
SPETTACOLI (ARG) well placed, held position three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, gained a short lead at the furlong marker,
then was no match for the winner and held the place. BIG RIG mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, made
a steady gain and missed the place. SCIENCE TO WIN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second turn,
then weakened the final furlong and held a share. PREQUALIFIED allowed to settle, looped three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane
and evened out. NEVANS pulled to contention down the backstretch, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path and faded.
SWINGSTAGE was no factor.
