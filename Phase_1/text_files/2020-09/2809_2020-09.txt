WICKED AWESOME rated outside a rival early on, dropped in past the five eighths, crept closer while saving ground leaving the far turn, continued
progression into the lane, angled out with three sixteenths remaining and was put to left handed rousing, moved past the leader leaving the furlong grounds
and steadily widened while kept to task. ARTFUL SPLATTER came in at the break and bumped with TASTING THE STARS, corrected and went to the
front, set a rated pace towards the inside, turned away challenges leaving the three eighths marker, moved back away heading to the lane, failed to contain
the winner in mid stretch but kept on with some effort to secure the place. SMOOTH WITH A KICK , bumped at the break, angled off the inside for the
backstretch run, bid three wide under urging and between rivals leaving the far turn, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths and faded. JULIANA (PER)
stumbled at the break, recovered and prompted the pace two wide, challenged nearing the three eighths, could not match strides approaching the quarter
pole, gave hard chase and faded. TASTING THE STARS , bumped and pinched back at the break, was taken wide early on, moved up four wide into the far
turn, briefly threatened soon after then gave way after six and a half furlongs.

MILLIE CHILD , rated behind horses on the, moved up in the two path between horses in upper stretch, angled outside near the sixteenth pole, closed
determinedly, led late and drove clear. LOOKIN FOR CANDY hugged the inner rail, prompted the pace and finished gamely in a sharp effort. KEEPER IN
SPITE sped to the early lead, set the pace in the four path around the turn and led until deep stretch. FLOWZANO stumbled leaving the starting gate, was
forwardly placed in the two path on the turn, drifted to the three path turning for home and failed to rally. MELISANDE lacked speed and passed tired rivals
late. PINS AND NEEDLES raced in the three path between horses on the turn and weakened. SIPPING CHAMPAGNE , four deep on the turn, was not a
factor. SUNDAY RED raced along the inner rail and weakened.

NEVER ENOUGH TIME dueled inside, gained a short lead around the turn, spurted clear under a drive past the three sixteenths, wandered outward leaving
the sixteenth marker and held sway. CHALON , stumbled at the break, recovered and edged up between rivals early, gave hard chase of the dueling
leaders mid turn, shifted out about four wide into the lane and closed steadily. LAST TRUE LOVE saved ground, was under pressure around the turn,
swung out and offered a mild rally to nab the show. BUNTING , four wide nearing the half mile marker, dropped in around the turn, saved ground into the
lane and had a slight response. AMY'S CHALLENGE , brushed at the break, hustled up and gained a slim lead outside the winner, battled into and around
the turn, failed to match strides soon into the lane and gave way. BYE BYE BERTIE broke inward and brushed with a rival, had her rider sit back briefly in
the opening yards, recovered and rated three wide outside foes, was under asking around the turn, angled five wide but failed to respond.

MISS MARLEY stalked a three way pace battle, eased out four deep leaving the turn, gained command outside horses approaching the eighth pole and
drifted in while drawing clear. NO DOWN DAYS hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace, faded and held the place. OUR BELLA NICOLE saved ground on
the turn, swung outside in upper stretch and passed tired foes. WHISKEY AND RYE bore out leaving the starting gate, three deep on the turn disputing the
pace, gradually weakened in the drive. HITCH A RIDE disputed the early pace between horses and gave way through the stretch. POTION bore out leaving
the starting gate and was outrun.

Footnotes
HARPERS FIRST RIDE drafted in for the backstretch run and settled, edged up into the far turn, came under coaxing and angled out for a clear run past the
five sixteenths, responded when put to a stout drive soon into the stretch, forged to command in mid stretch, kicked clear and switched over to his left lead
while comfortably best. CORDMAKER rated stalking the leader two wide, went on the attack after six furlongs, briefly went clear entering the lane, could not
resist the winner's charge but continued willingly to be well clear of the rest. AWESOME D J , off the pace while saving ground, gained past the three
eighths, could not kick on with the leaders past the quarter pole, but continued with interest after being angled out. TYBALT lagged off the pace, raced three
deep nearing the half mile marker, circled four wide into the stretch but failed to muster up a serious rally. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS broke a step slow,
chased the pace while between rivals past the half, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and faded. INFURIATED cleared early, set the pace towards the
inside, was put to pressure once confronted near the five sixteenths, ceded the lead approaching the stretch then gave way.

ENGLISH TAVERN bobbled slightly at the break, raced in the two path between horses on the turn, swung outside in upper stretch, closed resolutely
outside the leader and caught that one approaching the finish. BACK CHARGE , right to the early lead, opened up without being asked on the turn, raced off
the rail and gave way grudgingly. GLACIER PARK , along the inner rail on the turn, failed to benace. YES MEANS NO lacked speed, worked between
horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. INFINITY , four wide on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and weakened. RUM BOBBY bobbled at the
break, saved ground on the turn and retreated through the stretch. EJE GAMA chased the pace three wide on the turn, drifted to the four path entering the
stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
EASTERN BAY tracked inside, eased out under some coaxing mid turn, shifted back in some, bid to the inside of LAKI to take command near the sixteenth
marker then edged clear under a drive. LAKI dueled outside a rival, moved to command between rivals with three furlongs remaining, was guided three wide
holding a tenuous advantage into the lane, briefly cleared under a drive in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. THREES OVER DEUCES settled outside a
rival early on, angled out leaving the far turn, circled five wide advancing into the lane, moved up outside the leader nearing mid stretch, raced on his left
lead and hung late. WHERESHETOLDMETOGO , three to four wide and off the early pace, came under pressure past the five sixteenths and offered a mild
late response. ONEMOREGREATTIME prompted the pace three wide, bid three deep near the quarter pole, forced the issue past mid stretch then faded.
TACO SUPREAM drafted back off the pace, saved some ground, eased out in the drive but failed to make an impact. MERU sped to a short lead inside
rivals, lost command three furlongs out, kept up the fight into the lane then gave way.

FAIRY WISH stalked the pace racing near the inner rail on the turn, eased out to the four path turning for home, gained the lead outside horses while under
a drive inside the eighth pole and eagerly drew away. M. J.'S LADY moved up three deep on the turn, took aim on the lead in upper stretch, bid between
horses inside the eighth pole and was no match for the winner. AWESOME JAZZ set the pace, took the turn in the two path and weakened the final furlong.
MORAVIAN PRAYER saved ground on the turn, chased the pace and faded. SAYYIDA AL HURRA trailed.
