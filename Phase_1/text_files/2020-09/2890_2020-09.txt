Footnotes
LIBERAL LUNACY tracked the leading pair outside of ARBA early, settled midpack in the three to four path on the turn, was taken three wide near the five
sixteenths for a rally, found his best in the final furlong while under a drive, and took over in the final sixteenth. ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS was anxious in
the gate, was bumped by ARBA in the opening strides but nonetheless advanced to dispute the early pace inside of DARK NINJA, began to edge away
while saving ground past the seven sixteenths, carried his lead into the lane in the two path, drifted out in the lane, and was headed inside the sixteenth
mark. ARBA was reluctant to load and anxious in the gate, broke inward and bumped ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS in the opening strides, tracked the
leading pair inside LIBERAL LUNACY down the backstretch, continued in range of the leading pair while saving ground on the turn, came into the lane at
the inside of the tracking flight, chased on but proved no match for LIBERAL LUNACY in the final furlong. CANARY ISLANDS settled in the rear pair inside
of HERE COMES KYLE, continued in the trailing pair in the four path on the turn and while driven into the lane, lacked the needed kick in upper stretch and
chased only evenly late. HERE COMES KYLE was pushed along early but outsprinted, raced outside of CANARY ISLANDS in the rear pair, continued
outside that foe in the five path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, and had no rally. DARK NINJA broke through the gate but was apprehended by
an outrider almost immediately, disputed the early pace outside of ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS, failed to keep up with him from the seven sixteenths, came
into the lane between horses in the tracking flight, and weakened.

Footnotes
MY GRACE veered in and brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack through the opening furlong, began an early
bid on the inside approaching the half mile pole, saved ground while taking over the lead around the turn, veered out and bumped with PALACE DUCHESS
near the eighth pole, continued to drift out significantly in the final furlong while holding clear, and was disqualified and placed second due to interference in
the stretch. PALACE DUCHESS dueled for the lead between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, was bumped and forced to
check sharply when MY GRACE veered into her path near the eighth pole, cut in to continue her bid and couldn't get by that rival, but was later moved up to
first due to interference. NURSE SADIE hopped up leaving the break, raced off the pace up the backstretch, began a bid on the rail nearing the three
eighths pole, cut in near the eighth pole to avoid traffic and gained ground late on the inside. LILL QUEEN B bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the
gate, dueled for the lead on the inside in the early going, dropped back heading into the turn, raced in the three path around the turn, and made a second
run to improve position in late stretch. RAGGEDY DOLL PEACH veered out and bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the middle
of the pack up the backstretch, began an inside bid passing the three eighths pole, angled out to enter the stretch from the three path and weakened in the
final furlong. CREAL DREAMER stumbled leaving the gate, raced off the pace early, navigated the turn from the two path, began a mild bid in upper stretch
and flattened out from there. WAR COLORS was cut off and forced to steady to avoid hitting the inside rail when MY GRACE veered into her path leaving
the gate, raced off the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid. ZAPPI dwelt at the start, trailed the field up the
backstretch, made up some ground while racing in the three path around the turn, and was not a factor. A STEWARDS INQUIRY, AS WELL AS A JOCKEY
AND TRAINER OBJECTION WAS FILED AGAINST MY GRACE BY THE RIDER AND TRAINER OF PALACE DUCHESS FOR INTERFERENCE IN
UPPER STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW, MY GRACE WAS DISQUALIFIED TO SECOND.

Footnotes
CADET CAPTAIN cleared to the lead past the mile pole, took token pressure from FORT DIXIE into the backstretch but remained well rated on the lead,
cleared again past the five eighths, saved ground and continued comfortably despite LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS attending directly to his outside, turned back
that foe when driven into the lane, and held safely to the wire. GOLD HAWK chased inside horses, was taken out for the far turn run and pushed along three
wide, came into the lane three wide under a drive, could not reel the pacesetter in but continued on evenly under a drive. BIG MONEY MACHINE raced two
wide in the rear pair, improved position in the three path on the far turn, came into the lane under a drive inside horses, lacked the needed kick in the lane
but chased on willingly. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS tracked three wide through the clubhouse turn and the backstretch, bid two wide into the far turn, loomed
around that bend, could not match CADET CAPTAIN into the lane, and weakened between horses. O'MALLEY'S MARCH settled in the rear pair inside of
BIG MONEY MACHINE, trailed in the two to three path on the far turn, was driven into the lane and had no response. FORT DIXIE raced keenly between
horses on the clubhouse turn, pulled ahead to put token pressure on CADET CAPTAIN into the backstretch, began to empty out near the five eighths,
weakened in the four to five path on the turn and was not persevered with in the lane.

Footnotes
NO CENTS LEFT brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced off the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, began
a bid on the rail passing the quarter pole and pulled clear in the stretch. FOUR LEFT FEET hopped up leaving the gate, tracked the frontrunner on the inside
up the backstretch, began an inside bid near the three eighths pole, pulled clear from the two path entering the stretch and was caught in the final furlong.
FORT COMMANDER trailed the field through the opening half mile, navigated the turn from the two path and improved position on the inside in the stretch.
TELETAP chased the leader on the outside in the early going, began a bid from the four path passing the three eighths pole, was wide into the stretch, and
made a mild improvement while continuing to drift out in the stretch. LITTLE BALTAR veered out slightly leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack up
the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and was outkicked in the stretch. ZANFORCE stumbled slightly and brushed with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the stretch. SPEARED raced outside in
the middle of the pack in the opening stages, dropped back entering the turn, entered the stretch from the three path and made no bid.

Footnotes
GET NONE dueled two wide, edged to a narrow lead past the three eighths, opened up on the field when pushed along in the stretch, and increased her
advantage under a mild drive. KENAI COOL broke with the pack but settled back in the rear pair inside of ELIZABETH'S FEVER near the half mile, trailed in
the two path on the turn, was taken six wide in upper stretch, found her best in the final furlong, and got up for place. EDISTO ISLAND chased two wide,
was pushed along and taken out past the three eighths, rallied five wide in the lane, proved no match for the winner, and lost the place late. ALMAFUERTE
tracked the leading pair inside of TINDERELLA early, was pushed along two wide on the turn, proved no match for the leader into the lane, chased on two
wide, and flattened out the final sixteenth. HAL'S MISCHIEF chased inside of EDISTO ISLAND early, saved ground around the bend, altered three wide in
midstretch, and chased on willingly. ELIZABETH'S FEVER hopped at the start, raced at the rear, swung five wide on the turn, raced six wide into the lane,
and passed outside tiring horses under a drive. TINDERELLA tracked the pace two wide, was urged two to three wide on the turn, was driven four wide in
the lane, and came up empty in the final furlong. MORA VALLEY dueled inside of GET NONE, did not go with her from the three eighths, continued in range
to the quarter, and weakened inside.

KIANA'S LOVE brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, chased the leaders up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, ran into traffic
entering the stretch, found room and began a bid on the inside passing the quarter pole and pulled clear from there. BIT MONEY dueled for the lead on the
inside early, raced in the two path around the turn, gave way in upper stretch, but ran on well to hold second in the final furlong. D J SOUL SISTA brushed
with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, tossed her head in the opening strides, settled to trail the field up the backstretch, began to improve position
from the three path around the turn and continued gaining on the outside in the stretch. VALIANT LADY brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the
gate, came up the backstretch at the back of the pack, swung wide coming off the turn, entered the stretch from the five path and was outkicked.
AMERICAN BIZ raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, moved up to challenge near the three eighths pole, entered the stretch
from the four path and weakened in the final furlong. LETHAL LEANNE hopped up leaving the gate, tracked the frontrunners between horses up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and made no bid. CONSTANCIA brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced inside off
the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and was not a factor. FIRST HOOSIER reared in the gate, broke well, raced between
horses off the pace early, navigated the turn from the four path and came up empty in the stretch. CAN SHE SCOOT dueled for the lead on the outside
early, raced in the three path around the turn, entered the stretch between horses and tired from there.

rallied, kept coming gamely in the final furlong and got up in the final jump. GOOD BYE GREG came away quickly, pressed outside of AMERICAN
HERITAGE, vied with him into the lane, wore him down midstretch, kept on gamely while drifting out, and was nipped in the last stride. AMERICAN
HERITAGE was sent hard for speed inside, set a pressured pace while saving ground around the turn, vied inside of GOOD BYE GREG in upper stretch but
weakened in the final furlong. ROYAL COMMISH raced at the inside of the rear pair early, improved in the two to three path on the turn, saved ground into
the lane, and lacked the needed kick. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE was bumped soundly by SUSPECT in the opening strides, chased outside of ROYAL
COMMISH in the four path on the turn, was taken three wide into the lane, got bumped by PABLO DEL MONTE in upper stretch, and had no rally. PABLO
DEL MONTE tracked the leading pair outside of WILD WES early, kept on in the two path on the turn, weakened into the lane, came out and bumped ONE
