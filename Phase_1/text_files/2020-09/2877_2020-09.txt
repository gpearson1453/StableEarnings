Footnotes
ANNMARIA chased just off the leader to the turn, headed that foe and battled down the stretch while a bit rank at the top of the lane but proved best late.
ROSY MAY bore out and bumped a horse at the start, took the lead to the turn, was headed by the winner and battled down the stretch but came up second
best. FIVE O'CLOCK broke awkward, was last early, made a steady advance to gain position but was well back of the top two all the way. G CODE
stumbled at the start, chased the leaders within range, was left behind on the turn and lost position in late stretch. LOVETOLOVEYOU was mid pack to the
turn and had no rally from there. ENGLISH TOFFE ROSE was bumped at the start, last into the turn and no threat. LISNET was off the pace, inside on the
turn and empty.

LIKE THE KING away sharply to established control in short order, stayed clear throughout and hustled away in the final furlong under perfect handling.
BRILLIANT JOURNEY kept watch on the leader in good position throughout while proving no match in the late going. MIDNIGHT WARSHIP broke a bit
sluggish, pocketed in to far turn, angled out widest with a late run in the stretch for the show spot. SKY BOLT bore out badly first turn, settled in far turn,
advanced inside. CANDY MOVER tried to keep up with eventual winner to far turn, used up, faded. ARMADA ran in tandem with entry mate to the half and
gave way readily. NOPICKINONCHARLIE off slow from the start, never menaced thereafter. LETSHAVEABRANDY always outrun. GETTING JIGGY never
reached a contending position.

Footnotes
DANZO was off the pace to the turn, lost ground inside on the turn as the leaders moved forward, angled out in upper stretch and wore down the
frontrunners to get the win near the wire. EXCLUSIVE DONALD chased the leader all the way, led briefly in deep stretch but was nailed at the wire. SIETE
LEGUAS was up close, lost lengths on the turn as the leaders drew away, moved well in the five path coming in to the stretch and gained past the sixteenth
pole. HACIENDA BLVD showed speed to deep stretch but weakened nearing the wire. CAPE MARCO DRIVE brushed at the start, ran last, came five wide
into the stretch and gained ground in the final furlong. J DUB was up front early, backed off the lead and lacked a rally on the turn. DRAFT BEER was up
close to the turn and faded.

Footnotes
OSVALDO saved ground in perfect position to far turn, came right up the open rail, took over a slim margin and held off challenger to the wire. AGAINST
THE LINE was unhurried to far turn, circled field into the stretch and grinded away but could not get to the winner in time. HALF TRICK good speed under
restraint to the half, cleared to the quarter pole and drifted off rail with winner coming through and tired in the final furlong. STACK EM HIGH far back to the
half, looped around horses and improved position in the stretch. MOON LAUNCH sat in perfect position to far turn, came three wide past the quarter pole
but came up empty in the drive. IT'S GAME TIME was bothered a bit at the start and only improved position in the stretch. COME ON VENEZUELA chased
leader to the half only to surrender and fade back from that point. MY MAE DAY secured a good spot to the half with nothing left and dropped back readily.
LION LION dropped far back throughout the stretch run.

DISCREET KITTY sat off the lead, was pushed along and quickened on the far turn and continued as best in the stretch. ST. LOUISE ran mid pack to the
far turn, pulled while in the five path, ranged up in mid stretch but was no match for the winner. LIL HITCHHIKER bumped a horse at the start, went wide on
the backstretch while off the pace, came wide into the stretch while drawing closer and steadily gained down the lane. ANGEL FACE raced inside mid pack,
came up the rail in the stretch and had good courage late. SMARTY ARTIE raced off the lead, dropped back near the far turn, came widest into the stretch,
closed well to deep stretch and evened out. FUNNY FEATHER split horses early to lead up the backstretch, contended to the eighth pole and faded. ONE
LAST JIG was bumped at the start and never involved. MUSIC CITY WOLF led on the first turn, dropped back to prompt the leader to the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BIG TRIP sharp to the front and led all calls, leaned in a bit through the final sixteenth and prevailed to the wire with a good effort under stout handling in the
late going. UNITED STAND off leaders to the stretch with a late surge through the final sixteenth for the place spot. SUMMERDUCK with winner to the turn,
backed off a bit, rallied slowly through the late stretch and shied from being in close quarters would not go through and leveled off. TRIPLE DELIGHT
bothered start with no speed to turn, rallied widest past the quarter pole while going willingly in the final stages. RIPE had an inside trip throughout with no
late response when needed. BENNETT tried to keep up from outside to the turn with nothing left in the stretch run. HUGH B. bothered at the start and never
menaced. BUNKER BUSTER bothered at the start and failed to menace at any point thereafter.
