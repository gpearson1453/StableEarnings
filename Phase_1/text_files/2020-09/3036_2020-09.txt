Footnotes
POLITIKUM vied outside UNIMPEACHED for a quarter-mile, took over and moved inside up the backstretch, widened the advantage under pressure
through upper stretch, and was geared down a sixteenth out. UNCLE FUN was outrun for six furlongs toward the inside, and finished well along the rail.
EXPONENTIAL settled well off the pace to the stretch, and rallied outside to gain a share. SPEARGUN bumped with UNIMPEACHED at the start, chased
outside the winner to the stretch, and tired. PUGIN bumped with UNIMPEACHED at the start, checked lacking room behind the leaders into the first turn,
and had no rally. UNIMPEACHED was bumped between PUGIN and SPEARGUN at the start, vied early inside POLITIKUM, and tired after six furlongs.
TESTIFIED was finished after a half-mile. SO VIOLENT broke slowly and was always outrun. PAINTED RAGS checked back to last soon after the start, and
remained far back. TIRELESS CHAMPION raced three wide early, and was through after a half. YITO MACHINE broke slowly, felt the whip heading into the
first turn, and offered nothing. ARRENDAJO entered the backstretch at the back and in the middle of the course, and lost contact with the others.

Footnotes
ITSMYLUCKYGIRL advanced in the three-path after a half-mile, overpowered MERMAID KISSES from outside in upper stretch and edged clear.
SOCIALLY ASTRAY was outrun to the stretch four then five wide, and rallied on the far outside. ABARRIO FOREVER hopped slightly at the start and was
outrun early, moved in around the turn, rallied through the furlong grounds and was outkicked for second. FIAMMA MAMMA bumped with LA WAPA after
the start, stayed in range three wide for a half, and lacked the needed bid. DONA CAMILE raced forwardly to the stretch three to four wide, and weakened.
MERMAID KISSES slipped through along the rail to take a brief lead turning for home, but had nothing left past the eighth-pole. MIA'S BOBTAIL broke
slowly and was never close. MYFIRSTEXWIFE set the pace near the two-path, and was overhauled from both sides at the top of the lane. MYSTIC COMIN
HOME stumbled at the start, and was outrun. LA WAPA bumped with FLAMMA MAMMA after the start, and was through early. UPSY DAISY DO lost
contact with the field early, and jogged in far behind.

PUPPET MASTER tracked from close range three wide to the stretch, rallied determinedly and wore down BOCA from outside a sixteenth out. BOCA led
early but deferred to IMWAYTOOCOOLFORYOU up the backstretch, regained command after a half-mile, edged clear into the lane, but could not withstand
the top one late. COZY CAFE broke slowly, stayed close four wide to the stretch, and failed to seriously menace. FEARLESS GIRL broke slowly, saved
ground, and weakened on her left lead in the stretch. IMWAYTOOCOOLFORYOU went up to take over from BOCA early, got collared by that rival midway
on the turn, and faltered.

Footnotes
KUNAL took over from TIZ LUNA after a quarter-mile and moved inside, rated along through an even tempo, had matters well in hand when the rider lost
the whip in deep stretch, and remained clear. CARK prompted the pace two wide to the stretch, and finished with good courage to hold the place. BAD BOY
E. J. saved ground in the second flight to the stretch, rallied between horses through the furlong grounds and was up for the show. VINCITORE raced two
wide on the turns, and finished willingly. DUCHOSSOIS raced three wide on the turns, and was no threat through an even effort. TIZ LUNA vied early inside
KUNAL, yielded into the backstretch, and gave way after six furlongs. GOOD TIMING MAN went along three wide to the stretch in range, and faded.
BARBIE'S KING was four wide approaching the quarter-pole, and could not reach contention. RED SORRELL broke slowly, and was always outrun. BODIE
CODY saved ground early, was forwardly placed to the far turn in the two-path, and tired. HEY GRIFF broke slowly, and was never close. STILL SCHEMIN
was four wide on the first turn, and dropped far back before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
STORM THE BRIDGE swung five wide leaving the turn, rallied steadily on the far outside through the stretch, and edged clear late. FLAWLESS MOON was
under a drive in the two-path outside the three-eighths, waited behind horses a quarter-mile out, angled to the rail to join the leaders entering the final
furlong, and was outkicked to the finish. HYDRAULIC was never far back, lodged a bid in the four-path through upper stretch, and was outfinished.
DECKOLOGY raced three to four wide around the turn, had aim in the five-path through upper stretch, and weakened. RED NATION vied for command
from the outset, and weakened through the late stages in the two-path. R BOY EVENS contested the pace from the start, and gave way through the last
eighth of a mile. WICKED TEMPTATIONS raced four to five wide around the turn, and posed no threat. FANTASIZING broke outward, and never reached
contention. ICE PEAK vied up front between horses early, and tired after a half-mile. IBERICO lacked room between FANTASIZING and ICE PEAK and
steadied at the start, and was no factor. SHANGHAI MOON broke slowly, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MONA STELLA got pushed out by TEQUA at the start, set a pressured pace inside TAKE ME AS I AM, shook clear into the stretch and held sway under a
drive. CHAMPAGNE IVY advanced around the far turn being guided off the inside, loomed in the three-path at the top of the lane, finished well and was
second best. STARSHIP NTERPRISE raced two wide in the second flight around the far turn, moved to the rail for the drive and finished willingly. TAKE ME
AS I AM pressed MONA STELLA from outside for six furlongs, and weakened in the stretch. TEQUA broke out pushing out MONA STELLA, and failed to
menace. CRYSTAL COAST lacked room and struck the rail getting checked sharply approaching the first turn, stayed inside and tired after six furlongs.
LOVIN LIVIN broke slowly, trailed for six furlongs, and passed tired horses. VOW SAVER steadied behind MONA STELLA at the start, and was never close.
LUISANA PRINCESS lacked room and checked while keyed up approaching the first turn, steadied along through that turn having to be taken outside, and
was empty before reaching the stretch. GULF COAST GAL was four wide into the first turn, tracked outside the leaders for six furlongs, and gave way.
BONHEUR broke slowly, and was never prominent. ABUELA CORI was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
TAAMER was bumped lightly between horses at the start, went up to grab the lead and moved inside, was put to a drive past the quarter-pole, and stayed
well clear. HARPER GO LUCKY broke slowly, lagged well back for six furlongs inside, and finished with good energy on the rail. WICKED CITI was bumped
lightly between horses at the start, pressed TAAMER from outside, made no impression under a drive before completing six furlongs, and weakened in the
stretch. TONS OF GOLD bumped lightly with WICKED CITI at the start, raced three wide, and faded in the stretch. TRIBUTE FLAG was in tight along the
rail behind TAAMER near the half-mile marker, and lacked the needed bid when clear. EL ZEUS got bumped by ALADDIN SANE after the start, steadied
along behind a wall of horses up the backstretch, and was empty after six furlongs. ALADDIN SANE bobbled slightly at the start, came out nudging
TAAMER into WICKED CITI, then came back in bumping EL ZEUS, and was no factor the rest of the way. SLIPPY was finished after a half.

Footnotes
FULLY LOADED chased after TENCH from the start, was making no impression in deep stretch when the pacesetter suddenly lost his action, and inherited
the lead in the closing yards. YES I AM FREE brushed with MAX K. O. at the start, came off the rail to the two-path near the quarter-pole, swerved to avoid
TENCH in deep stretch and was up for second. TROPICAT was outsprinted around the turn two then three wide, and ran on willingly on the far outside to
get up for the show. TENCH dashed clear early, rated along inside to the stretch, was well in command nearing the sixteenth-pole when he lunged
awkwardly twice and lost all momentum, came off the rail and was overrun. MAX K. O. brushed with YES I AM FREE at the start, trailed inside to the
stretch, and gained belatedly on the fence. LAHINCH was outsprinted to the stretch, and closed a late gap. The start was delayed 14 minutes until a loose
horse on the course could be apprehended. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE
OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
AL HEYBAY took the lead inside after an alert beginning, got set down through upper stretch, and dug in to remain in control. JESS'S STRIDE advanced
around the turn in the three-path, shied out from left-hand pressure past the eighth-pole, and ran on with good courage clearly second best. GRAN
RUNNER was slow into stride, gained mildly around the turn two then three wide, and held the show with an even finish. KIGER was slow into stride, swung
four wide late on the turn, stayed on his left lead and could not gain late. NAVAJO CREED lacked speed far back to the lane, and passed tired horses.
WASON raced four to five wide around the turn, and tired outside the quarter-pole. FROZEN FUNDS was urged with no response entering the turn, and
dropped back into the stretch five wide. ABHAR pursued the winner from outside early, and faltered after a half-mile. ARTISTA dropped far back around the
turn.

Footnotes
MAN OF VISION chased outside the early leaders four wide, took over from outside with five-sixteenths remaining, moved in a couple paths and widened
through the stretch under a drive. KHOZY MY BOY had the two-path around the turn, stayed on his left lead and went clear for the place. ROYAL DUKE
vied outside BAHAMIAN BEAT early, lost position in the three-path around the turn, moved to the rail leaving the furlong grounds and came back on with a
good finish. ROAD TO PEACE was outrun to the stretch, and offered a mild response between horses through the furlong grounds to lane a share.
FLAMING HOT lacked speed for a half-mile, came widest for the drive and passed tired horses. VALIANT APPEAL pressed the early pace outside, and
faded through the stretch. BAHAMIAN BEAT vied inside early, briefly went clear into the turn, got overhauled by MAN OF VISION five-sixteenths out and
folded up. NEW YORK STYLE was always outrun. RODEO RED tired inside after a half.

Footnotes
MILES AHEAD was hustled hard from the gate, took over inside several rivals approaching the five-eighths pole, went along clear around the turn and into
the stretch, drifted out and had enough to hold on. MAN OF HONOR came under a ride around the turn four wide, and ran on with good courage inside
FRONT LOADED to save the place. FRONT LOADED was outrun early toward the inside, angled wide into the stretch and finished gamely on the far
outside. SILVERLY ENOUGH was outrun for a half-mile, cut the corner into the lane, and finished well on the rail. SIR KAHN was outrun to the stretch,
moved in from the three-path and gained late without threatening. SOUTH SEA showed early speed between horses, and faded through the drive. JOE DI
BAGGIO faded inside after a half. SMALL FORTUNE led through the very early going, and faded around the turn three then four wide. GNARLY dropped far
back around the turn.

Footnotes
CHAOS KID was forwardly placed for six furlongs alternating between the rail and the two-path, bid in the three-path through the stretch, and prevailed
between horses. YADI saved ground early, advanced approaching the stretch swinging out four wide, rallied on the far outside through the last sixteenth of
a mile and just missed. SENZAZIONE advanced inside after six furlongs, bid along the rail and reached even terms for the lead past the eighth-pole, and
was edged to the finish. THE DEVILS BACK bumped with CAJUN EMBERS at the start, went up to grab the early lead in the two-path, stayed on to deep
stretch and was overhauled from both sides. CAJUN EMBERS bumped with THE DEVILS BACK at the start, stayed in range three wide to the stretch, and
was outfinished. IMA COALMAN settled in the middle of the field early, and had no rally. BABY BROTHER was forced out at the start by STORM RISK,
raced four wide around the first turn, and made no impact. GIMMEABREAK was no factor inside. STORM RISK broke out and was slow into stride, and
never reached contention. REVOLVING STAR dropped well back early. BLACK HOPE prompted the pace outside THE DEVILS BACK to the far turn, and
gave way.
