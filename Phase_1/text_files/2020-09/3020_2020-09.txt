ZEP gave chase inside and raced at the rail on the turn, eased slightly out into the lane and dug in to get up the final yards. ARYA PEACEFUL took the lead
at the half mile pole and set a pressured pace through the backstretch, moved clear past the quarter pole, dug in under steady encouragement through the
stretch but was caught flattening stride the final yards. COMPOUND INTEREST gave chase two deep then lacked room nearing the quarter pole, but
recovered full stride midway on the turn, angled three wide into the stretch and finished evenly while gaining on the runner-up. BRET'S LEGACY engaged in
close chase down the backstretch then drifted toward the head of the lane and had little left. BULLGRATS pressured the pace then faded in the four path of
the turn. GHOSTLY SONG chased the pace and rounded the turn about the five path.

ECLIPTICALS VISKI closed to contention through the front stretch and raced with the pace, dueled the runner-up from the three eighths pole and raced at a
close disadvantage through the far turn, drifted toward the head of the lane but dug in under steady handling to get up later yards and raced clear nearing
the wire. RAINBOW RIVER rated with the pace inside and dueled the winner from the three eighths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far
turn, dug in under steady encouragement through the stretch but was caught in later yards. REYANA REYA DREAMS raced well off the pace about the
three path the first turn then eased to the outside into the backstretch, started a bid past the three eighths pole, was carried to the seven path nearing the
head of the lane and came along to take third later yards. MAIDU raced well off the early pace toward the inside then eased outward entering the
backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole but drifted to the six path nearing the head of the lane and flattened stride. VENETIAN DRIVE rated just
off the pace and off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and had range on the leaders in the three path of the turn but weakened the final furlong.
RICH IMAGE settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then weakened.
PLAY CHARADES saved ground off the early pace then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but, weakened approaching the quarter. ALLTINGZ R
PAZIBLE raced off the pace about the three path then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened approaching the quarter. Per

HARBOUR TOWN chased the pace through the backstretch and circled rivals in the six path of the turn, then dug in widest through the lane to get up the
final yards. RUSTY THE UPS MAN engaged in close chase outside and appeared a factor in the five path of the turn, dug in through the stretch but was
outfinished the final yards. DERBY DAY DREAMS gave close chase and took the lead approaching the quarter pole, contested the edge off the rail on the
turn, drifted into the lane, dueled briefly clear past the quarter pole but was caught flattening stride the final yards. ROCKET SOUND pressured the pace
inside, checked from tight quarters off the heels of Don'tmesswithbull past the five sixteenths pole, quickly recovered stride and rounded the turn off the rail
but flattened stride down the lane. DON'TMESSWITHBULL set a pressured pace from the half mile pole, was caught toward the quarter but remained close
at the rail through the turn, then weakened inside the eighth pole. ISLAND CADGER gave close early chase off the rail then faded through the turn.

Footnotes
SCHLOSSER stalked the earlier pace two deep then took the lead approaching the three eighths pole, dueled at mostly even terms from that point but took
the edge nearing the quarter pole, raced clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled to widen. LOOKS GOOD raced in the three path the first
turn then stalked into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage in the three path of the far turn and ultimately,
settled for second. CAVALLOTTO saved ground the opening turn then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path,
angled to the outside entering the stretch and was along for third the final yards. JAXBRADENRISHI rounded the first turn about the four path then started
an outside bid from the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn still in the four path then flattened inside the sixteenth. GOODBYESEEULATER rated
just off the pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced just off the rail on the far turn, then flattened out. OWL RUN raced
well off the pace and showed little response. B RASEN steadied early and raced well back. ROLLING BROOK rated the early pace inside, gave up the lead
nearing the three eighths pole though dueled at even terms from that point, dropped back a head toward the quarter pole, raced near the rail through the
turn then weakened. POET WARRIOR rated close to the early pace inside then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, faded approaching the
far turn and was taken up and vanned off sore.

Footnotes
MYWALKTOFREEDOM was hustled to the front along the rail past the three quarter pole and rated a short lead, came under pressure leaving the three
eighths pole, gave up the nod at the rail approaching the top of the lane but dug in under determined handling to ward off the game stretch effort of FANCY
CONCHO who stalked the winner from the five eighths pole, challenged past the three eighths and dueled to a slim lead two deep midway on the far turn,
but was outfinished in a game stretch effort. FINAL SAY rated just off the pace and off the rail the first turn then bid approaching the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn in the three path and raced evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. MAYHEM LIKE ME saved ground well off the pace the first
turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened stride later yards. FEISTY
AND SASSY settled well off the pace in the two and three paths the opening turn and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
came through the far turn about the four path then flattened out later yards. ZEHAVI rounded the first turn in the four path then settled off the pace entering
the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn. THE SEVEN FIVE showed little response through the
backstretch. LUFTY'S KISSES was not a factor.

FRONTIER WOMAN settled off the pace saving early ground then bid off the rail leaving the five sixteenths pole and entered the stretch at the rail, took the
nod mid-stretch and dug in determinedly to maintain the edge over LIKE ME OR NOT who dueled for control through the front stretch and rated a short lead
inside past the five eighths pole, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths, dug in leaving the far turn but was met mid-stretch and grudgingly ceded
the final sixteenth. OCEAN LILLY came away a step slow and raced well back off the rail the opening turn, eased out with a bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, circled rivals in the seven path of the far turn then dug in down the lane to take third the final strides. COOL MO rated close in the two and three paths
then bid leaving the three eighths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn, drifted toward the head of the lane then ceded third the
final strides. MAMA'S GREY GHOST raced in the three path the first turn and was well off the pace entering the backstretch, steadily improved her position
and came through the far turn about the four path, but was carried out entering the stretch and flattened the final furlong. ULTIMATE JUSTICE settled off the
pace in the two and three paths then eased out to give chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the five path and showed little more. After
losing the duel through the front stretch, SPRING LASS stalked the pace into the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then
faded at the rail on the far turn. SAVANNAH ROXANNA showed little response through the backstretch. BRIGINTINE ISLAND rated close to the early pace
inside, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
SIR MAJESTY raced in close proximity through the backstretch and took the lead nearing the quarter pole, widened at the rail through the turn and was kept
in hand throughout the stretch to win handily. MY TIME IN COURT chased the pace and rounded the turn about the three path, drifted into the lane and was
no match. FROSTY'S MAJESTY pressured the pace inside through the backstretch, was steadied at the rail past the five sixteenths pole and flattened
stride inside the eighth pole. CAYENNE CREEK gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the six path and finished evenly. TRUFFLES AND
GOLD chased the leaders through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four and five paths and finished evenly. BARN YARD BRAT gave chase off the
rail, rounded the turn about the three path and showed little more. LA DUQUESA set a pressured pace but was caught nearing the quarter pole and faded
off the rail on the turn. TRUE CROSSING was not a factor racing toward mid track. UNBRIDLED BOND chased the pace inside then weakened at the rail
on the turn. BARNSTORM appeared to be off stride and was pulled up, then walked off.
