Footnotes
ZAINALARAB off a half beat the fastest despite coming out a bit losing its footing at the start, saw EXACT assume the advantage soon afterwards, had the
pilot take hold as the aforementioned foe was getting maneuvered over to the inside route a panel into the contest, tracked that opponent sitting within range
from the pocket, came under some hand encouragement a sixteenth shy of the quarter pole, swung out two wide into the lane then was given her cue at the
three-sixteenths pole, whittled away at the deficit, struck the front end with approximately a sixteenth to go, and edged away. EXACT established the top
after being urged along for the first few strides, cut over to the rail, eventually settling at a slight distance from off it, showed the way, rated on a
loosely-contested lead, was switched over to stronger handling as the half was being completed, got reeled in in the general area of the sixteenth pole, had
no difficulty salvaging second. JADE EMPRESS stalked the pace towards path two, commenced the stretch one farther off the rail, proved no match.
WHITE FROST took up residence in midpack, underwent a three wide pursuit on the bend, got roused coming up to the quarter pole, fanned out four wide
from upper to midstretch, had no offering. BOSS CARA guided over to the rail after the break, was being hand urged while continuing to save ground on the
turn, cut the corner into the lane and faltered. TREASURE LANE sluggish after the field had been sent off and running, was three wide entering the turn and
sent out five wide exiting it, trailed throughout.

ME AND MR. C broke out at the start brushing PEPPER PIKE, settled two to three wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, then drew clear under a drive to prevail. MAKE A STAND grew keen
under restraint early on near the rear of the field three wide, tipped four wide into the clear and settled better once allowed some rein, tucked three then two
wide through the far turn coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung four wide into upper stretch, kept on to just secure the place honors on
the wire. DOUBLY BLESSED tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, got paused in
behind GRAVITAS straightened away before being roused when given some clearance as that rival drifted slightly out, paused once more a furlong out as
the seam inside closed up, tipped out a path inside that station asked once more and showed interest making late gain after splitting rivals to just miss for
the place honors. ZIPALONG three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, advanced at the three-eighths to stack outside the top pair applying pressure to the
leader coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, kept on the same pace through the stretch to the finish.
PEPPER PIKE got brushed between foes at the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under a ride at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through to the wire. GRAVITAS established the front and showed the
way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, remained patiently handled under pressure from a pair through the latter portion of the
turn, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole, then weakened through to the finish. THE
DR'S SLIPPERS broke in at the start brushing PEPPER PIKE, chased three then two wide, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and
tired.

Footnotes
HETTY G. away forwardly placed, became one of several vying for control, went about the chore from along the inside route, ventured onward under the
same scenario during the run around the bend forced to fend off a couple of rivals to her outside, settled onto the top of the lane and was asked for more,
gave the desired response kicking away to its largest lead during the remainder of the trip leading up to the eighth pole, shied out twice in the vicinity of that
station, in each instance after having the stick applied by the pilot from the left side, maintained a truer course afterwards and held sway. CAPE COD DIVA
underwent a ground-saving journey, came under a stronger ride by the five-sixteenths marker, cut the corner and rallied for the place. LOOKBOTHWAYS
pursued the pace from the two path, angled four wide into the stretch, made no headway in the final furlong. APPLETINI argued for command as the
outermost of three from path three until the three-sixteenths pole before giving way. MISS LIANA shifted towards the two path after brushing with one of its
next stall neighbors in the shadow of the starting gate, contended for the top from between rivals until approaching the furlong grounds then backed away.
TIZ A KITTEN an early pace factor, got taken back at the nine-sixteenths pole, went on to pursue the front runners three to four wide, got maneuvered out
approximately six wide for the drive, came up empty. RUVIES IN TIME didn't run off after breaking through the gate, proceeded to get brushed from both
sides shortly after the field had been released, departed the backstretch four wide, wandered out in the direction of path seven once in the stretch, fell
farther back then was pulled up quickly after earning a minor slice of the purse. GENTLE ANNIE suffered light contact from between opponents right after
the start, got set up in the two path, raced in between foes on the turn, was under a drive moving out five wide entering the stretch, lacked a response, then
was pulled up quickly after crossing the finish line.

DANNY CALIFORNIA coaxed from the gate to establish the front, showed the way well rated in the two path, remained patiently handled under the close
watch of YOU'RE TO BLAME to the outside but facing little pressure, had PETIT FILS advance briefly outside into the backstretch to midway before backing
away, came under increased pressure through the far turn and remained on hold until put to urging at the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch
floating his main danger five wide, dug in under a drive rebuffing the challenger inside the eighth pole and inched away in the late stages drifting slightly
while a little leg weary near the finish kept to task to prevail. YOU'RE TO BLAME tracked the pace along the inside in the early stages and through the
opening bend before tipping to the three path down the backstretch to attend the leader from the outside applying little pressure save through his presence,
tucked to the two path through the far turn and came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, got floated five wide into upper stretch, dug in threatening to
the eighth pole before being ultimately repelled to the finish while well clear of the rest for the place honors. ROCKETRY three to four wide in pursuit
throughout, came under a drive at the seven-sixteenths, went three wide into upper stretch and tired. COUNTER OFFER two to three wide in pursuit, came
under urging three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. PETIT FILS (FR) four then three wide in pursuit, advanced on the
top pair with one mile to run, applied light pressure before backing off with five furlongs remaining, faded through the far turn under light coaxing tucked just
off the inside, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
LOTTIE'S MIZZION along the outside throughout, took up the chase from the two path, flashed interest getting maneuvered outward springing from the
five-sixteenths marker, wound up five wide upon completing the move, accelerated to the front end, left the eighth pole holding a hefty advantage, drew out
to an even more commanding margin prior to being geared down for the final seventy yards. MEBS WEB along the rail on the backstretch, abandoned it for
path two by the top of the bend, kept watch on the pace from midpack, got driven towards path six heading for the three-sixteenths pole, proved no match
rallying for the place. BELLEZA disputed the pace from path two in between rivals until around upper stretch, weakened into the show slot down the lane.
IMPRSSTHEPROFESSOR took up the chase two to three wide on the turn, swung out five wide for the stretch run, mustered up a mild response. CROSS
KEYS pursued the front runners from along the inside route, tipped into the two path at the top of the lane, failed to make an impact. EMPRESS LUCIANA
involved early, was then patiently ridden in the pocket tracking the contested pace, was on hold forced to draft behind one of those front runners late on the
bend, slipped into path two coming up to the three-sixteenths pole, got cued up, failed to fire appreciably. MADAM DEPUTY argued for the top from path
three as the widest of three for a good portion of the trip leading up to the head of the stretch, backed away steadily afterwards. BANKERS BEAST set up
along the rail after the start, vied as the innermost of three for over a half, folded. AGGRAVATION strung out three wide on the turn, was through after going
a half.

SPACE LAUNCH tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into
upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in tussling with the runner up before inching clear in the late stages. SCARLETT SKY three wide
forwardly placed in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and fought on to the
finish to secure the place honors. CREW DRAGON three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide
into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. BUNKER HILL chased just off the inside from near the rear, tucked inside half a mile from home,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, shied out under a near sided stick a furlong out and improved position,
then got pulled up after the finish, refused to load in the horse ambulance and was walked off. HONORABLE established the front shortly after the start and
showed the way in hand along the inside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in and was collared a furlong out, then weakened in the final furlong.
MCLOVIN brushed the near side stall at the start, chased just off the inside until tucked to the inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. LOWCOUNTRY attended the leader from the outside in the two path
between foes, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper stretch before tipping back to the two path straightened away
and weakened. ASCENDING MOON struck the near side stall at the start getting away last, strode green in the early stages displaying some high climbing
action before settling a bit better three wide down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled four wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
BIG WONDER remained stationed in the two path after the field had been sent on its way, contended from between rivals beginning from the general area
of the half mile pole, kept pace with its fellow fighters all during the trip on the bend, settled onto the top of the lane and saw the rider go to work, started the
final furlong desperately clinging to the advantage, vied with vigour matched up with RED MULE to his outside from that juncture onward, gamely got the job
done. RED MULE secured a forward position travelling on the backstretch, left it from the three path, disputed the pace as the widest of a threesome, pilot
holding something back in reserve, was in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole when finally called upon for more, inched up, taking dead aim on the
winner by midstretch, fought fiercely against that rival all during the last eighth, just couldn't go by a foe equal to the task at hand. IMPLIED VOLATILITY cut
over to the inside after the start, kept an eye on the contested hand urged on the turn, got set down as the half was being completed, shifted out towards
path two in upper stretch, finished with good energy to grab the show award. DARING DISGUISE went into the the two path prior to leaving the backstretch,
sat within range of the front runners, keeping pace with them while being under a ride, got angled four wide for the stretch run, narrowed in. OUR
TROUBADOUR took up the chase three wide on the turn, was already being roused before the half had been rattled off, got steered out five wide early in
the stretch, mustered up a mild response. RIVER KNIGHT was sighted two to three wide near the rear of the field, got fanned out into path six from upper to
midlane, becoming the widest of all, gained, but without ever posing a threat. QUINTARELLI positioned along the rail in short order, went on to save ground
to no avail. THREEPOINTNINENINE rode the rail, vied as the innermost of a trio from the top of the bend until deep into the furlong grounds, faltered.
KNIGHT FROST two wide at the top of the turn, was four wide by the top of the lane, backed away.

Footnotes
PRAIRIE FIRE three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path with nine-sixteenths remaining
patiently handled through the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch, got roused near the three-sixteenths and rallied to take command a furlong from
home before edging clear to the finish to prevail. GOOD CREDENCE chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the
turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. FIERCE LADY coaxed from the gate,
showed the way through moderate splits three paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing nearing
the quarter pole and spun just off the inside for home set down for the drive under growing threat, dug in and was collared a furlong out, weakened in the
late stages while clear for the show honors. JEWEL OF ARABIA chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got coaxed along with
five-sixteenths to go, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. BABY BOSS brushed the near side stall at the start, chased three wide under a
ride from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. BUSTIN SCONES brushed the off side stall at the start, chased inside briefly
before tipping to be just off the inside, came under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

LASHARA (GB) away without apparent mishap, sat forwardly placed pressing the issue three wide, moved into the two path at the top of the far turn, kept
abreast of FLETCHING, challenged in earnest at the three-sixteenths pole, forged to the front with good courage, then inched away late. FETCHING three
wide for a good portion of the journey on the clubhouse bend, was in the two path before leaving it, was rated along on the backstretch showing the way,
accompanied by the top one from the outside, got guided over to the rail by the half mile pole, led the way by a narrow margin, was coming up to the
three-sixteenths pole when turned loose, saw the winner whittle away at the deficit, relinquished reluctantly, saved second. EYE OF A SOLDIER pursued
the pace from the two path, was between rivals during the run around the second bend, got cued up for the drive, flashed good energy after tipping out late,
fell short of snagging away the place. WINDFALL PROFIT proceeded along well rated taking the inside route until the conclusion of the backstretch after
making contact with MARY'S FRANCE in the shadow of the starting gate, sat parked out four wide on the far turn, was about as wide spinning into the lane,
narrowed in en route for the last major check. MARY'S FRANCE (FR) bumped with WINDFALL PROFIT right after the field had been sent off and running,
took up the chase two wide afterwards, being clutched and grabbed like many others during the opening phases, went three wide on turn two, was about as
wide entering the stretch, lacked a solid closing punch. KELLEYCANRUN tracked the front runners from along the rail, briefly waited behind others
approaching the quarter pole, got committed angling three wide into the stretch, made no impact. UNA LUNA rated in the pocket, faltered.

Footnotes
K. K. ICHIKAWA saved ground in pursuit from mid pack down the backstretch, tipped two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to
the wire. BIELEFELD just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under
a drive to collar the top embattled pair just inside the sixteenth marker while under threat to the outside and was nailed in the final strides to the finish and
forced to settle for the place honors. NERO'S FIDDLE three then two wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under a ride five-sixteenths from home,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch circling the backing away former leader, took to the inside straightened away rallying to take command near the
eighth pole, dug in head to head with BRICCO rebuffing that rival when overtaken by a pair inside the sixteenth marker, ran on to secure the show honors.
BRICCO four then three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to knock heads
with the aforementioned foe for command from the eighth pole to just inside the sixteenth marker before being repelled, then got outfinished in the final
jumps. NOBLE MISCHIEF five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a
belated kick to improve position inside the final sixteenth. SIDD FINCH seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path at the
nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. SELFMADE just off the inside
just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, began to advance offering up a bid near the quarter pole, was in the midst of tipping out from the
two path when paused, steadied and taken over the heels of NERO'S FIDDLE when running up quickly on that rival, swung three to four wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive and flattened out in the final furlong. SUPPLY SIDER six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide at the
nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE
forwardly placed from the gate, dueled with UNBRIDLED JOHN to his inside while three then two wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths taking
over sole command, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened. BROADWAY JOE forwardly placed in
pursuit along the inside, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. UNLIKELY chased just off the
inside from near the rear of the field, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under a ride at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and tired.
UNBRIDLED JOHN led early on inside before being engaged by JUSTINTIMEFORWINE from the outside, knocked heads with that foe widening away from
the rest down the backstretch, came under coaxing yielding command at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner backing away into upper stretch and folded.
