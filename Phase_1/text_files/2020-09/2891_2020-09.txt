Footnotes
MASON A. P. showed to the front inside, vied with a foe, dropped back on the turn, re-rallied and had good courage to gain ground down the stretch for the
win. SMUGGLER'S GHOST vied outside a foe, raced off the rail down the stretch, weaved in and out and held place after losing the lead in the final furlong.
CALL WEST was last early, made a steady gain in the five path on the turn and had a willing run down the stretch to prevail in a show battle. BIG ISLAND
raced inside early, was in tight briefly up the backstretch, moved out for room approaching the turn, took the three path and was willing late to just miss the
show. THE BIG GAMBLER hopped at the start, chased the pace from the rail, was pushed along on the turn, re-rallied to get near the front in mid stretch
and faltered from there. NOD TO PERSIA ranged up on the turn in the three path, led briefly in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BRINK POINT broke in and bumped a foe at the start, left last, gradually moved up, circled the field on the turn, led at the top of the stretch and widened
under minimal whip urging. ONE CRAZY RIDE took the lead, was clear to mid turn but ended up no match for the winner while having just enough to hold
second. MASTER VOLUME chased close up in the three path on the turn and had a mild rally late to keep the show spot. KID TEJANO bumped a horse at
the start, waited, came widest into the stretch and gained best late. LOVELY LADY LINDA was bumped at the start, raced up close, came three wide into
the turn while being roused, drifted out in the stretch and faded late. TORNADO KID was bumped hard at the start, moved up to track right behind the leader
and backed up on the turn.

Footnotes
IT'S SUMMER secured the perfect spot, came three wide past the quarter pole, lost whip at the eighth pole and still won under confident handling to the
wire. FINAL DELIVERY sharp outside to vie on rail to deep stretch, hung in gamely while best of the rest. ROUGHIN THE CITY unhurried to the turn,
outside run in the drive for show spot. MONKEY ZONE raced an inside trip to the stretch, angled out only to run up heels of rival who was drifting off rail in
the final furlong. WEASELER sharp outside to the front stayed to stretch, drifted out late. EARLY ARRIVAL close up between horses to turn, weakened from
inside in stretch. DAY IN THE COUNTRY brief speed to the turn inside, angled out with no late gain. BREACHER was off slow and never menaced. CITY
PEAKS of slow and far back, never reached contention. SOY CAPITAN slow from gate and failed to menace. the

Footnotes
PAQUIME climbed at the start, moved up to stalk the leaders, readily took over on the turn, was engaged in a duel down the lane and game to prevail late.
LOVE MY JIMMY showed speed inside a foe, was passed on the turn by the winner, re-rallied to engage that one down the stretch and ran gamely while
settling for second. HENRY MAC ran outside a foe on the lead, raced in the three path on the turn but was unable to keep up with the top pair down the
lane. RONNI'S STORM chased to the stretch and lacked a rally. WEAPON was off slow, under the whip from off the rail on the turn and no threat. SEATTLE
SEE YA dropped back on the turn, came wide into the stretch and had no rally. MIKI DORA was not a factor. The rider of HENRY MAC lodged an objection
against PAQUIME alledging interference on the turn but was disallowed by the stewards.

Footnotes
E Z'S WIDE OPEN was unhurried to the turn, began a rally from there, came six wide into the stretch and flew home late. CUP GAME waited, went in the
four path on the far turn and closed well late to nab the show from two leveling out horses. NO U TURN was bumped at the start, settled behind the leader
after going four wide on the first turn, took the lead mid far turn and gave it up after flattening out in deep stretch. DELANEY bobbled at the start, got the
lead inside on the first turn, re-rallied after losing the lead on the far turn, angled out in the stretch and leveled out in deep stretch. CHILLIN OUT was mid
pack, widest on the backstretch and very wide in the stretch while running even late. MODERN DAY DRIFTER stumbled at the start, was mid pack to the
stretch and faltered. VOLUME ON TAP was bumped at the start, ran a reserved third and faded on the turn. BIG PERFORMER was up close to the turn,
roused and empty.

Footnotes
ON BRILLIANT rated off leaders to stretch, rallied in earnest in the drive to edge clear in the final stages. BONUS FEVER bit tardy, rushed, dueled to the
turn, gained the lead into the stretch but could hold on and was run down in the final stages in a game effort. MARIAH'S GIRL had an awkward start, rushed
to the turn circled field and ran along late for the show.spot SPECIAL BLUE broke sharp to be in the fray three wide at the quarter pole, gained a short lead
past the eighth pole but came up empty late. CARMEN OHIO raced well off rail throughout with an even effort outside. SWEET EMPIRE raced along with an
even trip on the rail in the stretch run. MINI MUSKETIER could not keep up to the turn with nothing left in the stretch run. SCARF QUEEN had a slow start,
never reached contention thereafter. JANE'S GOLD TOUR off tardy outside, never a threat throughout. WINDY CORNER showed good inside showed,
speed to the turn, swerved sharply into the inner rail at the three sixteenth pole while tiring. The stewards posted the inquiry sign following the finish, looking
into the incident at the three sixteenth pole and deemed the order of finish official.
