Footnotes
THE DOGMEN stalked SQUIRRELY MIKE from just outside, took over when allowed leaving the second bend then steadily drew away under a mild drive in
the lane. SQUIRRELY MIKE bumped at the break, soon had a clear lead, was challenged on the backstretch, no match for THE DOGMEN when set down
for the drive, angled out inside the last furlong and was unchallenged for the place. IWANT SGT RECKLESS was bumped and forced into SQUIRRELY
MIKE at the break then back into WAVE THE GOLD, advanced from inside on the backstretch, had every chance the last quarter mile, ran evenly instead
and proved easily best of the others. BONNIE DANCES hesitated then was steadied some when crowded by SONERO, settled inside, picked up his pace
after a half mile and passed inside tired ones the last two furlongs. SONERO broke somewhat outward, raced in contention between horses for a half mile
but began to yield with three furlongs to go. WAVE THE GOLD reluctant to load, broke outward, bumping IWANT SGT RECKLESS then was bumped by
that one a few strides later, was also a factor from outside for a half mile then began to tire widest on the second turn.

Footnotes
WOOD NOT MIND settled early, gradually progressed from outside on the backstretch, engaged JUKEBOX MONEY on the second turn, battled in the lane
and shook free the final sixteenth. JUKEBOX MONEY shared the early lead just outside NO TANKS, moved clear on the backstretch, was challenged again
from outside on the second turn, fought gamely in the stretch but did not have enough left inside the last eighth. TAPNFIRE settled between rivals, picked
up her pace after a half mile, advanced two wide on the second bend, fanned out some for the stretch run, took over third, was no match for the top pair but
proved easily best of the others. PINK FOR ME was settled at the back the first half mile, commenced her bid into the second turn then passed between
tired ones the last two furlongs. BANG hesitated ad broke a bit awkwardly, progressed to midpack, saved ground taking the second bend and had no late
bid. NO TANKS displayed early speed from inside, did not keep up on the second bend, swung out leaving that turn and steadily gave way. ICE ATTACK
steadily yielded from well off the inside.

Footnotes
STOSH angled in early on, took over the lead along the rail on the bend then steadily drew away under a drive in the lane. EUGENE also moved to the
inside early on, waited for room along the rail on the turn, squeezed through inside ENOCH leaving the quarter pole and took over second inside the last
sixteenth. EL PRINCIPE I B pressed just outside PUNCHNGO, was forced to stay in path four on the turn, angled in entering the lane to be just off the
inside and gradually wore down. PUNCHNGO soon emerged with the lead and slowly drifted out on the backstretch, stayed in path three on the bend, was
overtaken from inside and flattened out the final furlong. SWEET CIRCLE also moved to the inside early on, was just off the inside on the bend, altered to
the rail when his path was taken near the quarter pole, came off the inside some for the stretch stretch and had little to offer. JAXONS POINT pressed from
outside on the backstretch, angled in to be just off the inside with a quarter mile to go, floated out some for the drive and also gave way. NARRATION raced
widest throughout and was never a factor. ENOCH showed little in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
DEAUVILLE MIST vied for the lead from between rivals from the beginning, took over two wide on the bend, floated out to path four entering the lane,
moved ahead upper stretch, was challenged from inside shortly after entering the last eighth and edged ahead of SEE GRACE FLY BY in the waning yards.
SEE GRACE FLY BY was reluctant to load, was prominent from the inside once the race began, waited while boxed in on the turn, got through three wide
entering the stretch, engaged DEAUVILLE MIST inside the final furlong, fought gamely but had to settle for second best. CAROL'S A CASE forwardly
placed from outside, closed the gap three wide on the bend, fanned outside DEAUVILLE MIST into the lane and slowly yielded the last eighth. SEATTLE
TRAIN without early speed, came into contention along the rail on the turn but wore down the final furlong. DANCING HIGH chased from outside, was just
off the rail on the bend, fanned out behind DEAUVILLE MIST entering the stretch and had no late bid. RUBY LEES SONG was away somewhat slowly,
moved up quickly from inside to gain the lead, was overtaken from outside on the turn, floated out some into the lane and gave way.

clear under a drive the final eighth. SIRCORRI was jostled between rivals leaving the chute and shuffled back, advanced two wide on the bend, swung out
behind INTERNET SUCCESS for the drive, steadily closed the gap and gained second in the waning yards. SERIOUS TALK jostled with
FORAFEWDOLLARSMORE leaving the chute, recovered to race in contention, was two wide on the turn, moved to the rail upper stretch and caught JOLLY
GHAALY for third late. JOLLY GHAALY broke inward, bumping GREAT GRET, disputed the pace inside that one, had the rail on the bend, did not stay with
INTERNET SUCCESS upper stretch, floated out some with a furlong to go and slowly yielded. G G'S SECONDCHANCE also jostled between horses and
shuffled back leaving the chute, progressed three wide on the turn, swung out to path five into the lane and made up minor ground deep stretch. MADE TO
FIT moved up quickly from outside to share the lead, came into the stretch from path three and flattened out. WILDCAT LITE raced in contention from inside
for a half mile, began to yield, angled out for a clear path midstretch and continued to fade. GREAT GRET was bumped at the start then jostled with G G'S
SECONDCHANCE leaving the chute, helped press the pace from outside on the backstrech, lost ground four to six wide through the bend and gave way
through the stretch. FORAFEWDOLLARSMORE was also jostled between rivals leaving the chute, raced in contention on the backstretch but gave way
from outside on the turn.

Footnotes
POSITIONEDTODANCE broke outward, bumping JAM UP, raced in the second flight, began to close the gap when encouraged three wide on the turn,
gained the advantage nearing the final sixteenth and was driven clear. TOMASITA bumped at the break, was settled, advanced from inside on the turn,
gradually angled out in the lane trying to gain a clear path, gained one five wide inside the last eighth and got up in time for second. MEXIA chased from
between horses, was three to four wide taking the turn, angled out further for racing room midstretch, closed well but was too late. LADY OF LAHTI without
early speed from outside, lost considerable ground four to six wide through the bend, surged the last furlong but was also too late. FOO FOO GIRL disputed
the pace outside JAM UP for more than five furlongs then gradually wore down. DANCING WELL raced in contention from inside for a half mile, did not
keep up leaving the turn, came off the rail some inside the last furlong and finished evenly. JAM UP was bumped and forced into TOMASITA at the break,
quickly recovered to vie for the early lead from inside then also gradually wore down with a sixteenth to go. ONLY PRAISE ME steadily yielded from
between rivals.
