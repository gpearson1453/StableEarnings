OL' L B pressed the early leader, led at the top of the turn and drew clear in upper stretch. CAPTAIN CORN was towerd the rear early, came five wide into
the stretch and closed willingly to earn the place spot. CATAPHRACT chased the pace, got close in upper stretch, was put away by the winner and flattened
out while still holding third. RANSOM THE BULL was last at the rail into the turn and improved position in the stretch. REBEL'S REVENGE raced as early
speed inside, took the rail on the turn and lacked a rally in upper stretch.

Footnotes
VALYCOVE raced in a good spot in third off the pace, quickened on the far turn, vied with a foe at the sixteenth pole and was best nearing the wire. ECRU
was bumped at the start, prompted the pace to the turn, vied a foe to mid stretch, vied another foe in deep stretch and was outfinished for the win, settling
for place. BIG LEMON was last early, widest on the backstretch and drifted out while rallying down the lane. BLUE STEEL led in hand early, vied with the
winner from the far turn to mid stretch and backed up. GLIDING ALONE broke awkward and bumped a foe, got close to the pace but dropped back a bit and
held position for the remainder. SPRING SOLO was unhurried, raced in the four path on the backstretch, was pushed along on the far turn, came widest into
the stretch and stayed even from there. SO CAUGHT UP IN U raced mid pack to the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
CALIKA ROSE led inside, found more on the far turn to stay clear and drew off. PERSONAL SERVER advanced to rally on the far turn and ran on to get up
late for second. SKYKAT had an awkward start, raced around the first turn in the four path, moved up to chase the winner from closer on the far turn, was
no match for that one and needed more late to keep the place, instead settling for show. THIRSTYFORAMIRACLE stalked while a reserved third, raced on
the rail around the far turn but lacked the needed kiick in the stretch. DULCE MARIA tracked from inside early, was pushed along on the far turn and was up
and down in late stretch at the rail. WHODUNNITANDRAN went in the five path on the first turn, raced outside of the field on the backstretch and faded after
the half mile point.

POSITIVE VIBES was last and way back early, caught up with the field entering the far turn, launched a quick middle move and led at the top of the stretch,
drawing off late. KIMBERLEY DREAM stalked in hand, led mid far turn, was no match for the winner but gained the place late. YIELD tracked in second,
vied on the far turn for the lead and battled down the stretch for place, was game but settled for third. DREAMIN' OF MUNNY was reserved from inside and
up close, contended to the stretch but lacked a rally. REDHOT KATIE raced off the pace, was widest on the backstretch and widest in the stretch while
managing to improve position late. TICKET TO RICHES was whip urged from the gate, showed speed inside and dropped back on the far turn.

Footnotes
SHE GOT IT never far back to turn, rallied nicely while gaining to the front, roused in the stretch and cleared off under good handling to the wire. BIONIC
ROSIE good start outside, with pace to the turn, took over but proved no match for the winner in the late going. EOWYN close up to turn, lost position from
inside and re-rallied to be along for the show spot. RHODA'S JEWELL had a terrible start, trailed early, rallied widest into the turn and improved through the
drive. TALE OF CONDUCT raced back in the field to the stretch and only passed tired ones in the stretch. LAHIRI never a real menace.
TINGSTHATMAKESENSE good speed inside to the turn and gave way readily in the stretch run. TENAKEE flashed brief speed but gave way with little
resistance. NO VA MAS bobbled at the start from outside, rushed to contend to the turn and came up empty. COMECATCHME was off slow from the gate
and never threatened. INCA PRINCESS outrun.

FIRERY TALE came away last, was last into the turn while inside, picked up the pace in earnest, came up the rail in the lane moving inside four rivals
spread across the track and gamely stayed in front;. MAJESTIC VALLEY got closer on the turn, went five wide into the stretch, matched strides with four
rivals at once and fought on for the place spot. GIANT HONOR was close early, ranged up in the three path on the turn, threatened while four wide in the
stretch, fought on amongst several foes and evened out for the show spot late. JAMMING CAMERON was speed to the stretch, bumped a horse twice, and
lost positon thereafter. RECKLESS L J raced between leaders early, dropped back but stayed close to mid stretch, was bumped twice, put a bit off stride
and faded late. CABOT TRAIL pressed the lead early and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
CREATIVE CREDIT cruised over nicely from outside, overtaken by rival to the turn, engaged leader while she was bearing out past the quarter pole dug in
gamely and cleared away as much the best today. GO STORMIN GIRL unhurried to the turn from inside, angled out for the drive, split horses past the
eighth pole to be along up for the place spot. THAT'S GREAT no speed to turn, rallied widest into the stretch run for the show spot. DANCEWITHTHEDEVIL
with winner early, took over in the turn, cleared while having trouble negotiating the turn and getting out badly past the quarter pole while tiring in the stretch
run. SENSE OF PLACE chased pair to the turn, gave in and dropped back. ORQUIDIAS BIZ off tardy and never a threat. DEVILS DAUGHTER raced close
up early but retreated quickly from the turn. HELGA SHMELGA was off slow and never a threat.
