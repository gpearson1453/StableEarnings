INSIDE RISK edged up off the rail and under rating nearing the half mile marker and took aim of the leader, inherited command soon past the five
sixteenths, dropped in when clear then held firm under a drive. GLORY SONG , urged inside chasing the pace, altered around a rival mid turn, gave hard
chase from upper stretch then was taken in hand late when unable to pose a threat to the winner. RISING PERRY broke slowly, was taken to rate three
wide early on, came under pressure into the lane and faded. ONE FAT KAT quickly went clear, set the pace towards the inside, was pulled up after
sustaining an injury nearing the five sixteenths then was euthanized on the track.

TIME FLIES BY , four deep around the turn, gained the lead inside the three sixteenths pole and edged clear. VICTORY GIVEN , two wide on the turn
stalking the pace, lacked room near the eighth pole, altered course to the far outside and rallied gamely. GONE HOME , three wide chasing the pace around
the turn, challenged for the lead in upper stretch and failed to sustain the move. STRIVE FOR A CURE broke alertly to make the early lead, set the pace in
the two path around the turn and weakened the final furlong. FATHER'S LUCK lacked speed racing well off the rail around the turn, angled in near the
eighth pole and failed to menace. COOL MAN CLETUS hugged the inner rail chasing the pace and faltered leaving the turn. MEO DESPERADO unseated
his rider when he reared at the break. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the break but no action was taken.

Footnotes
SUCCESSFUL ZIP had speed outside rivals then dropped in leaving the far turn, set the pace close to the rail and turned away a challenge leaving the five
sixteenths, opened up after being roused into the lane, kept on under left handed asking near mid stretch then was steadily hand ridden while eager to the
line. SUNMAN broke a step slow, was hustled inside rivals and reached a prompting position, dropped back a bit leaving the far turn, eased out under
coaxing leaving mid stretch and finished willingly to be second best. JACK STRAIGHT , between rivals early, prompted the pace outside the winner leaving
the far turn, briefly threatened mid turn, gave hard pursuit past the furlong grounds and faded. NO MORE TALK , four wide between runners leaving the five
furlong marker, dropped in around turn turn, came back out for the final furlong and finished with interest. CAUSE HE'S WESTERN moved up between foes
nearing the half mile pole and challenged, chased three wide mid turn and gave way. BOLITA BOYZ , urged from the gate, lost ground when four deep into
the turn, was under pressure chasing past the five sixteenths and faded.

Footnotes
CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY gained the lead along the inner rail entering the stretch, drew away under urging while steadily drifting out through the stretch.
ZEN PI bumped NEVERHAVENEVERWILL when bumped and forced in by HINTING leaving the starting gate, was four deep entering the stretch and
rallied outside foes. MORE TWIRL , four wide entering the stretch, took aim on the leader approaching the eighth pole then weakened. CONFECTIONER
bumped by NEVERHAVENEVERWILL leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail most of the trip and had a mild rally. JOHNG chased the pace,
was in the three path between horses in upper stretch and gave way. HINTING caused a chain reaction leaving the starting gate when he bore in and
bumped ZEN PI, he saved ground on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way. BRIGHTWOOD lacked speed, circled the turn four wide, floated to
the six path in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. PERSEVERED showed speed outside the winner, drifted out near the eighth pole and gave way.
NEVERHAVENEVERWILL , jostled and forced in leaving the starting gate, swung four wide in upper stretch, angled in near the eighth pole and was never a
factor. NOT TELLING chased the pace, raced in the three path between horses on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
JUST CHILL OUT , keen early on, bid between rivals near the three quarter pole, dueled under good handling around the turn, emerged in a battle with
CLASSY SOLUTION while being set down in upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage a furlong out then held firm after an extended drive. CLASSY
SOLUTION got engaged in a pace battle inside rivals early on, gained a short lead nearing the turn, fought on valiantly through the stretch and just missed
in a sharp effort. MINT GAME , four wide stalking the dueling leaders, was under solid asking past the three eighths, shifted out wider in the drive and faded.
HOSTILE WITNESS , bumped at the break, lagged well back, was under a ride around the turn, swung out in upper stretch but failed to rally. PISTOLEIRO
broke inward and bumped with a rival, vied three deep for nearly six furlongs, failed to keep pace past the three sixteenths and gave way.

Footnotes
FOGGY DREAMS , reserved off the early pace while three to four wide, quickly gained after being given her cue past the three eighths, wrested command
nearing the eighth pole, responded to left handed rousing and was edging away in the final yards. LADY MAGICA , quickly went clear, set the pace towards
the rail, was joined in upper stretch, dug to past the furlong grounds and stayed on well. DI angled out early, was hard ridden chasing the leaders past the
five sixteenths, circled into the lane and had a mild late response. ALGODONAL broke outward and brushed with a rival, straightened and saved ground off
the early pace, took closer order past the five sixteenths, had aim into the lane but faded in the final furlong. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) edged up early and
gained a stalking spot, failed to kick on under pressure near the quarter pole, stayed in range to mid stretch then gave way. MORGAN'S Z VA , brushed at
the break, failed to keep pace and faded through the drive.
