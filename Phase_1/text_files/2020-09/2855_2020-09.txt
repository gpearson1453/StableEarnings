energetic handling. BRAMBLE QUEEN raced off the pace inside, made a three wide run nearing the quarter pole and finished well for the place spot.

third. AUNT HATTIE (IRE) was bumped at the start, raced two wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied and was outkicked in the lane.
IONIC tracked between rivals, chased inside on the far turn and tired. WISH YOU WERE MINE was bumped at the start, raced three wide early, stalked
three wide, chased on the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
BAND SWEETHEART stalked two wide, bid two wide at the quarter pole, dueled with WILDCATTIN past the furlong marker, drifted in past the sixteenth
marker bothering that rival and edged away for the win. WINDIXIEWIN raced off the pace, moved up in the stretch, angled out past midstretch, rallied late
outside and got up for second. WILDCATTIN set the pace, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely inside of BAND SWEETHEART in the final furlong, was
forced in causing her to interfere with O'MALLEY past the sixteenth marker, then dug in and held third. O'MALLEY raced off the pace inside, moved up
inside entering the stretch, rallied on the rail, was forced to check in deep stretch and then closed inside. SARATOGA BEAUTY raced off the pace two wide,
came three wide into the lane and closed belatedly. AWSUM ROAR raced two wide off the pace, between rivals at the quarter pole and had no rally. SNOW
FORECAST raced three wide off the pace, chased three or four wide on the turn and weakened. LEO'S DIAMOND raced four wide off the pace and failed to
threaten. BANGLE GAL raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. DOUBLE DOWN DARE raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn and did
not factor. POLITELY CROWNED steadied at the start and was outrun. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection by the rider of O'MALLEY against
the winner, BAND SWEETHEART was disqualified and placed fourth for causing interference in deep stretch.
