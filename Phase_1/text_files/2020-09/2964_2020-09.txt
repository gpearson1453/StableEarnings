Footnotes
ONE SWEET STEP had good speed and proved clearly best. APOLLOS DASHN COWBOY stalked the pace and proved no match. ZINGING THE BLUES
chased the pace, lugged in on the turn and kept on. LOTA LEGACY was outpaced, got shut off on the turn and was checked at the five-sixteenths marker
as a result. COWGIRLSRUNNINGREBEL was forwardly placed and came up empty. O PAS MONEY was outrun. SPYDASHING lacked room at the start.
FOLLOWING THE RACE, THERE WAS BOTH A STEWARD'S INQUIRY AND A JOCKEY'S CLAIM OF FOUL REGARDING AN INCIDENT ON THE
TURN. AFTER REVIEWING VIDEOTAPED REPLAYS, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED ZINGING THE BLUES FOR INTERFERENCE AND PLACED
HIM FOURTH.

Footnotes
TOUCH 'EM UP taken in hand early, commenced his bid on the far turn, circled the field while five wide into the stretch and was clear. ONE STOP SHOP
settled while four wide, advanced on the far turn, continued four wide into the stretch and finished well. PREACHER TIME dueled early, was challenged
throughout and worn down late. KNOCKS BIG THIRST stumbled at the start, chased while three wide and lacked a rally. BIG HEARTED FACTOR forced
the pace and weakened. ROCK CITY ROADHOG never menaced. CHUCKMATE saved ground and faded.
