Footnotes
LOBANESS was away alertly to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths pole and drew off through the lane.
BRETT stumbled at the start, rushed to contend, chased the winner from the inside and failed to gain on that foe in the drive. DECKLOAD chased the
winner while racing four-wide, drifted out through the final sixteenth and lacked the needed late response. CONTINUE ON VICTOR was off slow then
allowed to settle, raced off the rail through the turn, was carried out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly when clear. TIZ BRILLIANT settled off
the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly late. AWAY HE GOES showed no early speed,
raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace. RACE OFFICE broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and weakened
after going three furlongs.

STAND TO was away in good order to duel for the lead from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn, opened a clear margin into the lane and
held sway to the wire. LONG LANCE was off slow then allowed to settle, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch, could not
reach the winner but finished with a steady bid. TIME 'N TIME AGAIN settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached a contending
position and finished evenly late. ROYAL ASPIRATIONS disputed the pace from the inside for a half and gave way. MOSQUITO FLEET was away alertly to
vie for the lead while racing four-wide and weakened after going three-eighths. AMAZING TIMES was off a step slow, showed no early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and was not a factor.

steady bid. HAYNESFIELD HIT was bumped at the start, set a pressured pace from off the rail and weakened through the final furlong. CHUKIT settled off
the leaders from the inside and failed to menace. HEFTY GARCIA showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch

MR BINGLEY tracked the pace of the winner from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, responded when set down for the drive and wore that foe down
in the closing yards to be going away. LAST ONE STANDING sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, maintained a clear margin in
mid-stretch but could not resist the winner from over the top. EMPIRE RULER lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with a late
rally. STYLE DADDY settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. WILD WILD KINGDOM raced off the
pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and did not menace. SOLAR HEAT showed no early speed, saved ground throughout and did not
menace. HURRICANE FORCE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. ATTERCOP lacked early foot, raced three-wide

Footnotes
INDYGO BO was reserved just off the leaders early while racing from off the rail, moved up to take command with a furlong to run, opened a clear margin
and was fully extended to hold ONE TUFF MINISTER safe late. ONE TUFF MINISTER lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn,
angled out further into the lane and again in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. DOUBLE A. PROSPECT settled off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the second turn, angled out for racing room nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with a late rush. JACKSON TELLER was away in
good order to chased the leaders from the inside throughout, stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly. CANDY'S MARTINI sprinted clear before
going a quarter, raced off the rail while setting the pace, responded when challenged nearing the half and gave way through the final furlong. LONG GAME
raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and gave way in the drive. DUSTIN'S
PASSION lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn, offered a bid nearing the quarter and failed to sustain his rally in the drive. STAY IN
POWER showed no early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not menace. DYF raced five-wide through the first turn, chased the leaders
while racing three-wide, offered a bid nearing the half and weakened after going six furlongs.

Footnotes
SHOE GAME tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew off. CLASSIC LEAH
set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged nearing the eleven-sixteenths pole, re-cleared into the lane but could not resist the winner
late. IF YOU WANT IT lagged early, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished willingly. ZANAB was forwardly
placed early, raced four-wide through the second turn, offered a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive. CHOTEAU raced four-wide
through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. INDIAN POWER was away in good order to press the
pace of CLASSIC LEAH while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe after the opening quarter, vied and weakened after going three-quarters.
BEAU ROCKS raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SOVEREIGN NATION sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. BLEU MUSKET broke sharply to chase the
winner while racing three-wide throughout and failed to gain on that rival in the drive. HOSS settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn
and finished with a steady bid. COOLER THAN YOU showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to menace. ARUGULA tracked
the winner from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and weakened. FRENCH COAST lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a
factor.
