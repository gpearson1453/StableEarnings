Footnotes
VIVID VERSE tracked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, took over command in the upper stretch, drew clear near the eighth pole and held at the
wire. CANTRELL HILL chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining in the late stages. GANGLY stalked
the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch with some late gain. BAOZUN raced back early on, was on the inside into the
lane with a mild gain in the stretch from the rail. TOWN DRUNK set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run.
ATMOS stalked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. ICECAP chased the pace early, was in the five path into
the lane and leveled off late in the stretch. HALF TRICK was never a threat. FIREHORN hopped at the start and was no factor. DEANO hopped at the start
and was done early. BAQUERO FLIES was a bit slow at the start and trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
GUIDED MISSILE settled off of the pace along the inside, advanced to loom large behind the leaders around the turn, tipped four wide while still inside of
TOTALLY JIMBO at the five sixteenths pole, then three wide turning for home, produced a bid in upper stretch outside of FASTLY, dueled with that foe
through the final furlong, drifted out from left handed pressure through the final sixteenth, but still prevailed. FASTLY vied three wide, drew clear off inner
foes approaching the quarter pole and shifted down to the rail passing that marker, but met a challenge from GUIDED MISSILE inside the three sixteenths
pole, dug in and dueled gamely inside of that foe through the final furlong, got headed at the sixteenth pole, kept on as that foe drifted, but still missed.
PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE saved ground far off of the pace, shifted out to the six path through midstretch, and offered a belated rally to be gaining on the
leaders through the late stages, but ran out of ground. TOTALLY JIMBO lied close up to the pace two wide early on, the got floated five wide at the five
sixteenths pole before shifting back three wide turning for home, but failed to keep pace with inner foes in upper stretch, and chased those rivals through the
lane. MOLIERE vied for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but failed to keep pace passing the quarter pole. FULL AUTHORITY dueled for the lead two wide
and between horses, but failed to keep pace passing the quarter pole. POTERYA was off slowly and trailed the field, took the turn two wide, but was outrun.
LAKE NIMROD stalked four wide, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
IDOL tracked from midpack three wide, quickly advanced past a pair of inner foes at the three furlong pole to take dead aim on the loose leader turning for
home, chased that foe through upper stretch despite that rival holding his margin, but inched closer under a long drive passing the furllong pole as his
counterpart began to tire, wore that foe down at the sixteenth pole, and drew clear. THE SOUND set the pace along the inside, built a clear margin into the
turn and held it in hand around the bend, then was roused approaching the three sixteenths pole to maintain a margin from IDOL, but tired in the final
furlong, was headed by his outer rival at the sixteenth pole, and gave way while well clear of show. EMPERADOR swung five wide turning for home while
well off of the pace, and stayed on mildly to surpass tiring foes while not threatening the leaders. TURNAGAIN TIDE advanced from midpack inside of foes
to a stalking position into the turn, but was outmoved by IDOL passing the three furlong pole, then chased the leaders through the line, and was outfinished
for show. TOO HOT raced forwardly placed two wide early on, but retreated to midpack into the turn, and steadily faded. DEO VOLENTE bobbled a bit at
the start, raced off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and never factored. BEACHCOMBING pressed the loose leader from the outside, but
weakened between horses at the three furlong pole. FIFTY GRAND was reluctant to load, then was outrun and showed little. LUCKY ASSET went wrong
approaching the eleven sixteenths pole, pulled up and untacked in the vicinity of the five furlong pole, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
ESTILO FEMENINO trailed the field down the backstretch, picked off foes in the three to four path through the latter half of the turn before swinging six wide
turning for home, rallied outside of foes through the lane, bid outside of CHOCOLATE KISSES at the furlong pole, and prevailed over that foe in the final
sixteenth. CHOCOLATE KISSES tracked from far off of the pace in the three to four path, then came into the lane five wide and between horses, rallied
through the lane inside of ESTILLO FEMENINO to bid for the lead between horses at the furlong pole, dug in, but flopped back to her left lead at the
sixteenth pole, and was bested by her outer counterpart. SANENUS (CHI) pressed the pace setter from along the inside early on before taking back at the
half mile pole to stalk from the pocket, shifted two wide at the quarter pole to split the leaders in upper stretch, produced a bid for the lead inside of ESTILO
FEMENINO and CHOCOLATE KISSES at the furlong pole, but was bested by those foes through the late stages. GOLD STANDARD advanced from off of
the pace in the three path around the turn to be in range of the leader four wide turning for home, but was outkicked by outer foes at the furlong pole. NEW
ROO stalked four wide and between horses early on, inched closer into the turn to vie three wide, forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, but began
to tire in upper stretch, then weakened between horses at the furlong pole. JOY EPIFORA (ARG) saved ground from midpack, shifted two wide at the
quarter pole, and finished up evenly. TALK VEUVE TO ME bobbled at the start, set the pace in the two path early on, then along the rail and inside of a pair
of foes into the turn, but was headed at the five sixteenths pole, dug in in upper stretch, but weakened passing the furlong pole. TAKE CHARGE ANGEL
stalked two wide and between horses, but steadily faded around the turn. GOODBYE EARL tracked from midpack five wide around the turn, but weakened
through the lane. HARMLESS prompted the pace three wide, then vied two wide and between horses into the turn, but weakened passing the five
sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
MR. MONEY stalked along the inside and from the pocket, saved ground around the turn before surging inside of WARRIOR'S CHARE at the three
sixteenths pole as that foe left the rail open, then inched clear approaching the sixteenth pole, and held safely from wide late-surging foes. BOURBON
CALLING raced far off of the pace along the inside early on, smoothly left the inside at the five sixteenths pole before swinging six wide turning for home,
then rallied inside of THIRSTFORLIFE down the lane, and surged through the late stages to prevail for place via photo over his outer counterpart.
THIRSTFORLIFE settled far off of the pace, took the turn in the five path before swinging seven wide turning for home, then rallied outside of foes through
the lane, surged outside of, and along with, BOURBON CALLING in the final sixteenth, but lost the photo for place to that foe at the wire. DINAR was
fractious in the gate, then broke slowly, raced far off of the pace before advancing five wide and outside of foes around the turn, then sustained his grinding
advance through the lane, but was outfinished by wider surging foes in the final sixteenth. EBBEN tracked from midpack four wide, inched closer turning for
home, but only produced a mild kick before getting outfinished by outer foesw. PIONEER SPIRIT stalked three wide, bid for the lead into the turn before
forging an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, but was headed by a ground saving rival passing the three sixteenths pole, and gave way. BANKIT trailed
along the inside before shifting four wide in upper stretch, but chased leading foes willingly through the lane to cut the gap. WARRIOR'S CHARGE set the
pace while staying about a path off of the rail, vied inside of a pair of foes into the turn, got headed by an outer rival at the five sixteenths pole, dug in
between rivals passing the three sixteenths pole as MR MONEY made a rail bid, then yielded through the final furlong. EVERFAST tracked from midpack
two wide and between horses, shifted three wide turning for home, but failed to make an impact. ALKHAATAM saved ground from midpack, but failed to
factor before weakening in upper stretch. HOME BASE took the turn in the four to three path while off of the pace before swinging six wide turning for home,
but did not produce a rally. AMERICAN ANTHEM prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses in to the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
WAR LIKE GODDESS rated far off of the pace in three to two wide around the turns before swinging five wide turning for home, then rallied through the
lane, shifted ground a bit inwards passing the furlong pole, and drove past the leader inside the final sixteenth. LEAH CHASE raced forwardly placed two
wide, grinded away at the loose leader's advantage in upper stretch, drifted out steadily passing the furlong pole, shied from WAR LIKE GODDESS
approaching the sixteenth pole, and was outfinished by that foe while achieving place approaching the wire. SAIL ON ELLEN cleared off early on while
racing keenly, opened up down the backstretch while still not quite settled, but got a breather around the far turn before kicking away again in upper stretch,
but began to tire after being put to driving pressure at the furlong pole, drifted out, and was outfinished by outer surging foes in the final sixteenth.
LONGPANTS REQUIRED saved ground from midpack before swinging four wide in upper stretch, but lacked a kick to challenge the clear leader, then shied
in tight quarters at the furlong pole as LEAH CHASE drifted out and WAR LIKE GODDESS leaned in, took back from those foes, then kept on through the
closing stages. TIZ PENNEY was off slowly and trailed the field, took the far turn three wide before turning for home six wide, then failed to threaten.
DEMORA took the turns in about the two path while far off of the pace, but shifted to the five to six path in midstretch, put FASHION MO into tight quarters
and caused that foe to steady inside the final furlong, and failed to factor. GO TWEET stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid before weakening
in midstretch. FASHION MO was squeezed back at the start, tracked from midpack two wide while in the three to four path around the turns, but failed to
keep pace with inner foes in upper stretch, tired, then was squeezed between DEMORA and TIZ PENNEY at the sixteenth pole while weakening. ZAWADI
trailed in the four path around the far turn, and was outrun. Following the race, the rider of LEAH CHASE claimed foul against the rider of WAR LIKE
GODDESS for interference in deep stretch, but the objection was disallowed by the stewards.
