Footnotes
THECHROMEWEKNOW settled in the middle of the field three wide early, rallied to contention turning for home, split horses in mid stretch and edged clear
staying on his left lead. VENEZUELAN WINNER pressed the pace three wide, and ran on with good courage between horses. GEOMETRICO went along in
the middle of the field two wide for a half-mile, moved to the far outside for the drive and rallied willingly. ENSIGN PARKER broke inward and was slow to
begin, rushed up along the rail and lacked room behind COMPETITIVE HERO approaching the half-mile pole, moved out and challenged for command
between the latter and VENEZUELAN WINNER five-sixteenths out, led into the stretch, but weakened through the late stages. WATER CAY saved ground
outrun to the stretch, moved out several paths and was going well belatedly. FULL SEND broke in and was off slow, swung four wide off the turn and lacked
the needed bid. COMPETITIVE HERO set the early pace inside, came under attack from two opponents on the turn, and gave way in the lane. TIN ROOF
RUSTY was outrun throughout. WAR DOCTOR brushed with UPRISE at the start, and was outrun. UPRISE brushed the right side of the gate, then brushed
with WAR DOCTOR at the start, and was never close.

Footnotes
TOKYO was sent through to vie up front inside SIMPLE STORY near the half-mile pole, gained the upper hand coming off the turn in the two-path, and
moved clear under pressure. SIMPLE STORY set the pace in the two-path, responded when joined from inside by TOKYO going to the turn, maintained a
short lead to the top of the stretch in the three-path, could not match strides through the furlong grounds and saved the place. LA VIEXA was bumped
around between FRERET and GALWAY STAR at the start, raced in the two-path around the turn, moved out in the stretch and finished evenly. JEANIE'S
ANGEL bumped with BATI BATI at the start, then came in and bumped GALWAY STAR, advanced around the turn near the inside, and lacked a final
closing bid on the rail. KARENINA stayed in range three wide for six furlongs, and faded in the drive. GALWAY STAR came in after the start bumping LA
VIEXA, then got bumped by JEANIE'S ANGEL in the next stride or two, and tired after showing brief speed three wide. BIZNESS BEAUTY was urged inside

CAIRO CAMPAIGN sprinted clear early inside, got roused at the top of the stretch well in command, and was kept to pressure never in danger.
MAKINALEGACY was outrun early, swung four wide off the turn, and rallied on the far outside staying on his left lead. EXTRA DOUGH advanced around
the turn four wide, was clear for second entering the final furlong, but could not hold that spot. BOMOSEEN raced three wide in range to the stretch, and
could not threaten with an even finish. ROMARIO was slow into stride, and made no headway on the rail through the stretch. ADIOS SEE YA chased
outside the winner early, and faded after a half-mile. SMARTY J AND B dropped far back three wide before reaching the stretch. J Z MY MAN showed early
speed inside, retreated on the turn, and stopped in the lane. RAMSEY'S EMPIRE was hopelessly far behind after a half, got pulled up in the stretch, and
walked off.

STEADILY followed behind the first flight into the turn, waited behind horses in the two-path near the three-sixteenths, split HARD WEST and MONEY
COME rallying to the lead a furlong out, and drove clear. CAPITAN FOFO tracked outside the early leaders, lodged a bid three wide approaching the
stretch, loomed through the furlong grounds, and was outfinished staying on his left lead. JACK B WINKLE broke slowly, raced three wide around the turn,
and rallied mildly outside the runner-up. MONEY COME pressed the pace outside HARD WEST, reached a short lead between horses five-sixteenths out,
stayed on to mid stretch and gave way. EXATLON raced four wide and failed to factor. HARD WEST set the early pace inside, got collared before
completing a half-mile, and faded in upper stretch. EL GRAN CACAO was outrun throughout. ALL D' HYPE was finished early inside.

R U LUCKY tracked outside early, was urged up three wide to join the leaders from outside after a half-mile, wrested command through the furlong grounds
and pulled clear, and was all out to preserve the decision. STRONG ENDING saved ground outrun early, cut the corner rallying up the rail turning for home,
and was getting to the winner late. DIAMONDS ENJOY brushed with FIVE OF HEARTS at the start, sprinted clear early inside, got headed after a half, and
weakened in the two-path. FIVE OF HEARTS brushed with DIAMONDS ENJOY at the start, was urged along for early position inside, moved out three wide
approaching the stretch, and lacked the needed bid. AIN'T WASTING TIME was outsprinted early, swung four wide into the lane, and made no headway. U
S S COLTON pressed DIAMONDS ENJOY from outside, challenged for command between horses near the five-sixteenths, and gave way into the stretch.

Footnotes
CARSON CITY KID veered in at the start forcing WARRIOR'S PRIDE inward, grabbed the early lead in the two-path, fended off a challenge from
WARRIOR'S PRIDE leaving the turn, battled inside THIS DUDES NO FOOL through the furlong grounds, exchanged bumps coming to the sixteenth-pole,
and eked out a hard-fought decision. THIS DUDES NO FOOL was bothered at the start as WARRIOR'S PRIDE crossed over, loomed in the four-path
outside the leaders a quarter-mile out, exchanged bumps with CARSON CITY KID past the eighth-pole and just missed while clearly second best. DOO
WOP DON hit the right side of the gate and bobbled slightly at the break, then was shut off behind WARRIOR'S ROSE, advanced four wide around the turn,
and gained mildly outside finishing well clear of the rest. BIG VENEZUELA got pushed in by DOO WOP DON and steadied after the start, lagged well back
to the stretch, and was going well on the rail late. BLACK V. K. rushed up inside and checked behind CARSON CITY KID going to the half-mile pole, moved
out in upper stretch and made no headway. MASTER OF DISASTER broke slowly and was outrun three wide. WARRIOR'S PRIDE was forced in by
CARSON CITY KID at the start and greenly veered in across several lanes, pressed the pace in the three-path, shied in sharply from right-hand pressure
just past the three-sixteenths, and gave way. MASTER Q tired after a half two wide. TOP BOMB was through early inside.

Footnotes
GATOR FIFTY TWO took the early lead, vied outside PRICEY VICTORY around the turn, got brushed repeatedly by the latter through a long drive, and
prevailed gamely between horses. YES FOR LESS raced four wide around the turn already under a drive outside the quarter-pole, loomed outside the
leaders through mid stretch, and just missed. PRICEY VICTORY hustled through inside to join the leaders before completing a quarter-mile, battled inside
GATOR FIFTY TWO around the turn, came out brushing that rival repeatedly through the stretch, and ran on stubbornly to the finish. THE SPIDER moved
up around the turn three wide to appear a threat, then was one-paced through the lane. STARSHIP TAXI checked sharply hard to handle behind the leaders
past the half-mile marker, stayed in the two-path and ran on evenly, then veered out sharply galloping out after the finish. ACASEADAY showed early speed
outside, and dropped back around the turn three wide. ALL STAR SEILER was outrun to the stretch, and was eased up in the late stages. CAT GONE
QUICK stumbled three strides from the gate and checked back to last, got pulled up into the stretch far behind, and walked off.

Footnotes
LIKE YOU was nursed along on the lead in the two-path for six furlongs, shook off pursuers turning for home, and drew well clear while drifting out. PRINCE
JAMES stayed close four wide early, was under a drive from the three-eighths, and finished willingly outside to hold the place. YOUCANTCATCHCURLIN
was never far back, came under a ride midway on the turn, and ran on evenly inside. INDIMAAJ lacked room behind the leaders in the two-path a
quarter-mile out, and had no solid response when clear into the final furlong. FIFTH TITLE was shuffled back and steadied between INDIMAAJ and PRINCE
JAMES past the half-mile pole, moved way out off the turn, and could not gain. LOUIS LE GRANDE pressed the pace outside LIKE YOU for six furlongs,
and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
ALEJANDRO'S TEAM moved up steadily through the backstretch run, came through an opening on the rail and ran past the leaders approaching the
quarter-pole, and drew away through the stretch under a mild drive. IMPERIAL GREATNESS vied up front in the two-path inside LORD D'ORO and CUY,
had the winner come barreling through to his inside late on the turn, and ran on for the place. CUY hit the right side of the gate and stumbled at the start,
contested the pace outside rivals in the four-path for nearly six furlongs, and was outfinished for second. D. SILO advanced toward the inside around the
turn, but could not sustain the rally. ANIMA D'OR stayed in range early, and tired in the two-path around the turn. PROSPECT PROJECT faded four wide on
the turn, and dropped far back. LORD D'ORO vied between horses in the three-path to the turn, and was finished after five furlongs. BLACK CAPE HERO
dropped far back into the stretch, was pulled up and walked off. SEAGAR offered no response to urging entering the turn, was pulled up into the stretch and
walked off. This race was hand timed, fractional times unavailable.
