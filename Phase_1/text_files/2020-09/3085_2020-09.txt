CONQUEST STORMY was well placed early, raced three wide on the backstretch, made a four wide bid past the quarter pole to loom boldly, hit the front by
the sixteenth pole, then was going away late to prove best under a drive. CLOSE THE CASE pressed the early pace three wide, then made a bid from
between rivals to vie for the lead past the half mile pole, fell back entering the stretch, then came again late to gain the place. C JS BILLY BYU was four
wide into the first turn, then went up to press the pace four wide, made a bid past the quarter pole to draw clear entering the stretch, drifted in upper stretch
and faded late. CJ'S BILLY'SEMPIRE was off five lengths last, settled in the back, came into the stretch four wide to offer a mild late rally. BAHNKE was
allowed to settle early four wide on the backstretch, moved over closer to the rail on the far turn but was empty. DARKNSTORMYTIME failed to menace.
FIVE GRAND set a pressured pace on the inside then gave way.

GREELEY AND BEN pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for the lead past the quarter pole three wide, gained a short
advantage past the eighth pole, then slowly edged away to prove best under a drive. FIRERY TALE hesitated to be off slow at the start, then was outrun the
first quarter of a mile, started to unwind past the three eighths pole, then altered course twice in the stretch for racing room while finishing fast. IMPACT
PLAYER set a pressured pace on the inside then dueled for the lead with the winner past the quarter pole, then gave way grudgingly, bested rest. HERE
COMES DOC was allowed to settle while five wide past the half mile pole, then moved over to be three wide past the quarter pole, swung out five wide for
the drive to offer a belated rally. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER chased the early pace, then made a four wide bid past the quarter pole but flattened out. LAND
BATTLE tracked the pace four wide then weakened.

MATILDAS MAGIC stalked the early pace and made a three wide on the turn, drew off in the stretch to prove much the best, driving. GLOWED was well
placed early in between rivals, made a mild bid four wide leaving the quarter pole but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best.

alertly to set the pace to the quarter pole then weakened. ARTFUL MEMORIES was allowed to settle early, came into the stretch five wide but offered no

Footnotes
MAJOR SPARKS raced inside, was asked near the three-eighths pole, rallied at the quarter pole, raced five wide in the stretch and was clear under steady
urging. HERE COMES TREY stalked the early pace, bid at the five-eighths pole, dueled outside of the leader, was clear in the stretch but then yielded.
FEVER TEMPLE raced three wide and found his best stride late. CUSTERS LAST STAND was clear early, dueled inside, then faded. COLONEL MOON
raced evenly in the three path. THE STORY BEGINS saved ground. HOPPED UP stalked outside before fading in the stretch. SUNDAY DRIVE was not a
factor. MICHAELS TARNATION stalked five wide before fading.

Footnotes
PERFECTLY MAJESTIC was rated back early, made a quick four move past the quarter pole and assumed command with authority, drew off in the stretch
to prove much the best under a hand ride. SURGE PRICING set the pace for six furlongs but offered no resistance to the winner while staying on to be
second best. STEEL SHOT was allowed to settle early, came four wide in to the stretch while advancing and offered a belated rally for the minor rewards.
CONFIDENTIAL stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid to vie for the lead past the quarter pole but could not sustain that bid. RHINESTONE
ROMEO passed the tiring rivals. JOCKER JUSTICE was allowed to settle early on the in side, then had to check past the three eighths pole, no rally.
SHOBIZ STAR checked into the first turn and dropped back. ESKENDEREYAS DREAM failed to menace. BLUE STEEL stalked the pace three wide before
tiring.
