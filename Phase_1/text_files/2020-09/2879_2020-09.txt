V. I. P. CODE set all the pace from the outside, raced along the inside through the stretch and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. CANDY
CRUSHEM stalked the pace while racing three wide down the backstretch, continued to raced three deep in the stretch and finished second best. SOUND
OFF was allowed to settle early, raced towards the inside and had no final winning bid. NILEATOR was slow early, raced four wide at the eighth pole and
had not enough in the drive. ALL GOOD TIMES raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. LINDA'S NEKIA pressed the pace from the
inside and gave way.

EMBRACE A NEW DAY pressed the early pace, raced four wide into the lane and prevailed late under all out pressure. BELLY FLOP settled off the early
pace, moved up to split rivals just past the eighth pole while racing two deep and just missed in a game effort. RIDGELYSREDHOT stalked the pace, raced
three wide through the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. WALK IT OUT NANNY was slow early, raced six wide into the upper stretch and closed in
on the latter stages. RELEASE ME set all the pace and gave way. EXTRAVAGANT MISS stalked the pace, raced five wide at the eighth pole and had no
late response. PETES PRIDE was unhurried early and failed to respond.

JOHN'S PROMISE stalked the pace along the inside, moved up four wide in the stretch and finished well to get up under strong handling.
CANDYGRAMFORMONGO stalked the early pace, raced five wide into the lane and finished second best. BOURBON STREET showed good early speed
along the inside and weakened in the latter stages. RULING pressed the early leader and gave way. KID SLIPPER veered in sharply at the break, lost his
irons, regained his irons midway down the backstretch and was never involved after losing all chance at the start.
