Footnotes
R CHERRY tracked the pace pulling, held her position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew
off late. MOMS LOVE stalked the pace on the outside, moved up and shook clear through the turn, then was no match for the winner late and held the
place. PINE JUNCTION allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and closed well for the show.
DAISES OF MAY allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled widest and got up for a share. MY
LITTLE MELODY well placed, steadily lost ground. GOOD HEARTED CAT set the early pace inside and faded through the turn. JUMP STOP was a brief
factor. SHORE SHOT stalked the pace from between rivals, lost some ground through the turn and had no rally.

PEPPER allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain, edged ahead and held. RAIN
DANCE rated inside, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, shook clear, then was no match for the winner and held
the place. DARK LIGHTNING broke out at the start, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out, could not gain and held
the show. REIGN SHOWERS ran evenly off the rail for a half, bid three wide into the lane, angled in and got up for a share. MONGOLIAN ANGEL was a
brief factor, inside. SUMMER HOURS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin to the lane then faded the final furlong. DEB'S ALL OUT

Footnotes
ORCHESTRAL set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid through the second turn, shook clear, then drew off in the late going and held. MISSION
DRIVEN allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the place.
BUZZ OFF allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and lacked the needed late kick, while gaining the
show. CORTEGE stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, could not match strides, weakened and held a share. TIGER PAW
tacked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong. GO HIPPO GO mid pack,
looped to a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. BALK mid pack and inside, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened in the drive. GRAY DUDE ran evenly. JOYEUX improved position. REPLAY
well placed, faded after a half. CONQUEST GIROBALL allowed to settle, gained position four and five wide through the second turn and had no rally. C
