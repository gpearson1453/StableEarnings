Footnotes
RB RICH LYKE ME went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, drew off at will on the far turn, widened
without encouragement into the final furlong and won easily. AA DBUSTER tossed his head while keen under restraint early, saved ground on the first turn,
was rated just off the pace, lost touch with the winner on the final turn and safely secured second. AA RICH MOTHER went four wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, was urged along while dropping far behind the winner on the far turn and failed to respond while best of the rest. VAZS DESTINY SV
was off two lengths slow, raced inside to the two path on the turns and was no factor. BIG CHARLIE went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on
the outside, was through after a half-mile and retreated.

Footnotes
RB KINETIC set the clear pace, opened up a sizable advantage, repelled two challengers into the final furlong and drew off under strong urging. RB
WHISTLIN DIXIE settled towards the front, rallied late on the far turn, made a bid into upper stretch but proved no match for the winner while clear for the
place. UPTOWN LADY ARABELLA settled near the front, gained late on the final turn, made a bid into upper stretch but flattened out while clear for the
show. VIXEN MHF was off slow, settled well off the pace, moved closer under urging on the far turn but lacked the needed response. AMYS LITTLE DIVA
AA settled well off the pace and failed to threaten. DJUDJU SEQ raced well back in the field and was no factor. BIG PURITY was through early and
retreated. AA RICH WHISKEY went six wide on the first turn and showed little.
