bore out into LIME HOUSE LOUIE in midstretch and tired. BENEVOLENT PRINCE raced two wide and failed to matter. AMBLIN MAN wasn't far back

failed to menace. NAUGHTY PRINCE broke in the air, raced wide around the first turn, improved position into the far turn then tired. FORGOTTEN ONE

Footnotes
MISS CRAIGIE was slow early, circled into the stretch, took over in midstretch and edged clear. SNEAKY COWGIRL was unhurried, raced three wide
around the turn, vied inside the winner into the final sixteenth but couldn't keep pace late. REVOLUTIONARY MARY raced two wide around the turn, gave
her best between rivals into midstretch but wasn't enough. FIRST FOREVER showed speed outside, moved two wide to command before a half then
weakened. MISS PINK came out three wide on the turn and couldn't gain between rivals in the lane. DULCIBELLE (GER) took command at once, made the
pace along the rail into the turn and tired in the lane. NAUT A GIVER advanced inside early then tired. GLORIOUS MYSTERY showed speed between
rivals to the turn then tired. MOSCOWS GOT TALENT was outrun after a slow break.
