HEAVENLY MINE was unhurried and last early, got closer from inside on the turn, angled out in the stretch, closed and fired late to pass foes near the wire.
CONJURING bobbled at the start, chased and then battled with the leader to the eighth pole, led late and yielded to the winner near the wire. OHIO SILVER
was near the back, raced widest on the backstretch, entered the stretch in the five path, closed and passed faders late. GRADUATEWITHHONORS raced
off the pace, was roused on the turn from inside, took the four path into the stretch and ran on, passing a fader late. ADVENTURE LAND was lone speed to
the turn, vied with a foe to the stretch, fought back to the eighth pole and faded. CANUSTAYTONIGHT raced off the pace and was no threat.

VORTICES away well and secured position to far turn, took over into the stretch, cleared at eighth pole and held sway under confident handling to the wire.
DANCE THE DAY AWAY tracked top pair to deep stretch, had dead aim on leader with a furlong to go but not enough to go past. HERO OF THE BEST
speed to the front, pressured after the half and faltered from the rail in the stretch run. AIKEN FOR GOLD in hand around first turn, never untracked while
evenly in the late going. BUTTER UP KATIE no speed to far turn, advanced widest with a mild late run. MARIA ROSE raced along evenly from inside
throughout with no late kick. PLEASE DO tried to stay close from between horses, came three wide past the quarter pole while well on empty by that point.

POWER BANKER sat behind leaders to turn, came three wide with a rush to clear off in the late stages. MAYBETHEDAY broke awkward at start, way back
to turn, circled field past the quarter pole and ran for place. TIZ STELLA inside trip throughout, came up rail for the show spot while best of the rest. HOTTIE
STILETTO good speed to the front, held to quarter pole, came up empty. SWING MUSIC never a menace. FANCY KELLY tried hard to keep up to turn,
nothing left faded back stretch. SUMMIT POINT pressed leader to turn, gave way readily when becoming rank late. LEGEND BOUND reared at start losing
best chance, never close. MIDNIGHT STROLLYNN through early, dropped far back.

Footnotes
TWISTED EMOTIONS was reserved as lone speed, went clear on the turn and quickened down the lane without being seriously threatened. C C MY SIS
stumbled at the start, was last into the turn, split horses at the top of the stretch and rallied off the rail to steadily advance for the place spot. TIN CAN ALLIE
raced off the pace to the turn, ranged up three wide into the stretch, chased the leader best from second but leveled out late to settle for show.
EVENSCORE raced well off the pace, moved up on the turn and held position down the lane. CURLIN COED chased from off the rail, came from between
horses into upper stretch, closed but leveled off in the final furlong. LIVE IT UP was up close to track inside, angled out wide into the stretch and faded.
COMPANYS COMING stumbled at the start, was quick to the front and faded in upper stretch. FLAWLESS FACE lost footing at the start, ran close early,
dropped back on the turn and faded in the stretch.
