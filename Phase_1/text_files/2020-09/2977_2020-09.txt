Footnotes
BLUEGRASS CANDY well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room
and closed well to finish on equal terms with EMERALD CITADELLE. EMERALD CITADELLE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid
into the stretch, shook clear, then weakened late and finished on equal terms with BLUEGRASS CANDY. BEKKI'S DANCE broke out bumping a rival at the
start, was allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and closed willingly. AMAZON LIZZIE mid pack,
gained position three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, weakened late and held a share. TAPPING THE KITTY mid pack, moved up two and
three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and flattened out. COUNTRY THUNDER tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the
turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. SECRET MILITAIRE rated inside, angled out and gained position on the
two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and faded the final furlong. PEGGY N JUDY mid pack, moved up three and four wide
through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and weakened in the drive. YOUR KIDDEN ME was never involved. BANANA KOVA showed little.

drew off and was kept to the task. INDEPENDENCE LAW sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then was
no match late and held the place safe. GOOD NEWS tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then

lane and closed well for a share. ANDIAMA allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and weakened in the

Footnotes
MISS UNDERSTANDING well placed and outside, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, gained a short lead, then
drove clear and held. CYBERBURG allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and closed
well late to gain the place. FOOT RUB LOVE vied for the early lead on the inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, then weakened late
and held the show. GENUWINE mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn,, bid on that path into the lane, angled out and got up for a share.
STARRY AFFAIR mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened in the drive. HELLS BELLS HELEN set the
pace off the rail, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. FUSI was no factor. ACADIA FLEET mid pack, moved up three
wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and had no rally.
