Footnotes
LADY TRAVELER dueled for the lead inside of ALTERED SHOT, shook free and drew clear of that rival and other bidding foes passing the quarter pole,
and held well under driving pressure. PRINCESS LEA stalked along the inside, saved ground around the turn right behind the pace setter, shifted two wide
approaching the furlong pole to produce a bid outside of the leader, but did not have enough to catch that foe in the final stages, and chased her home
wilingly. ALTERED SHOT tracked from midpack, advanced in the three to four path through the latter half of the turn to produce a four wide bid at the
quarter pole, but drifted outwards from left handed pressure in upper stretch, failed to keep pace with the inner leader, and leveled off. GOOD WITH
NUMBERS dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses passing the quarter pole. DRAMATIZER was off slowly and brushed the gate at the
start, raced far off of the pace in the four to five path around the turn, and passed tired without making an impact. LIAM'S LASS bobbled at the start, raced
off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and failed to factor. EUPHORIC stalked three wide, inched closer outside of the dueling leaders turning for
home to produce a bid at the quarter pole between horses, but flattened out in upper stretch, and weakened in the late stages. THUNDERING CREED
hesitated at the start and brushed the gate, then was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
GINNY B stalked IRISH WILLOW from the outside, bid for the lead into the far turn before forging an advantage from that rival passing the three furlong
pole, drew clear from her inner counterpart approaching the quarter pole, stayed clear through midstretch, but tired late, and just held IRISH WILLOW's
rebid at bay at the wire. IRISH WILLOW set the pace along the inside with a loose lead into the backstretch, but was challenged by GINNY B into the far
turn, got headed and outpaced by that foe approaching the five sixteenths pole, then altered course to be outside of that rival passing the quarter pole, kept
on to rebid for the lead in the late stages as FLASHY BIZ rallied along side, but just failed to regain even terms with the tiring leader, and just held place.
FLASHY BIZ trailed the field in the two path, advanced around the far turn before swinging four wide turning for home, then rallied through the lane to
produce a late bid outside of a pair of foes, but missed. LADY O'PRADO tracked from midpack two wide and between horses around the first turn, shifted
three wide turning for home, then chased the leaders evenly through the lane without producing a bid. B SKY HIGH saved ground off of the pace, but never
got involved. SINGSONG BIRD stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid before weakening through the lane. SILLY NOTION chased from
midpack three wide, chased the leaders through the far turn, but weakened while being fanned five wide at the quarter pole, and was eased through the
lane. GOLD INCLUDED was caught four wide while off of the pace around the first turn, but was outrun thereafter, showed little, and was eased through the
lane.

Footnotes
LOOKIN FOR LOKI dueled for the lead two wide, forged an advantage at the quarter pole, dug in inside of a pair of foe in midstretch, then kept FOLIAGE at
bay while hang in his left lead. FOLIAGE stalked along the inside, tipped three wide passing the quarter pole while inside of SPICY MARG, bid between
horses in midstretch, but hung and failed to catch the leader. SPICY MARG stalked four wide, inched closer turning for home, grinded away to bid outside of
a pair of foes in midstretch, but did not have enough to keep pace with them late. LOYAL LOUIE prompted the pace three wide, but failed to keep pace with
inner and outer foes passing the quarter pole, then kept on through the lane. CEES GET DEGREES hopped at the start and brushed the gate, raced far off
of the pace in the four path around the turn, got fanned to the seven path turning for home when an inner foe veered outwards, yet produced a mild rally
through the lane. LOCK UP dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but failed to keep pace with that foe passing the quarter pole, and gave way
while hanging on his left lead. ROMAN PHAROAH tracked from midpack two wide, but failed to factor. ABSOLUTE CHAOS tracked from midpack three
wide, but failed to make an impact. WHISKEY PLANK saved ground far off of the pace but failed to factor. STUD PUPPY was off slowly and outrun
throughout. SEATTLE SEE YA broke well and vied two wide and between horses early on, but got rank approaching the half mile pole, lost action and
multiple lengths worth of position due to it, then raced far off of the pace around the turn before veering outwards turning for home.

Footnotes
BANGO stalked three wide, bid at the three furlong pole, before forging an advantage at the quarter pole under confident handling, then kicked clear
approaching the furlong pole, and held safely while being kept to task to the wire. WILD WES pressed the pace two wide and between horses, but failed to
keep pace with his outer foe approaching the quarter pole, shifted outside of that foe through midstretch, and kept on through the late stages. MAILMAN
MONEY tracked from midpack in the two to three path, but came under a drive at the three furlong pole, shifted four wide turning for home, leveled off
through the lane, and finished up evenly. LYKAN saved ground while stalking, then stayed on along the inside through the lane. NIGHT TIME set the pace
inside a pair of foes into the turn, but was headed at the quarter pole, then tired in midstretch. DIGITAL settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted five
wide turning for home, but was flat and lacked a kick outside of rivals. HIGH PROOF bobbled at the start, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HENDRICK dueled for the lead two wide, forged clear passing the three sixteenths pole, then met a challenge from BOLD MINISTER along the inside in the
final sixteenth, and just held. BOLD MINISTER hopped at the start and was off slowly, saved ground while steadily advancing around the turn, then
sustained a rail rally through the lane, but just missed at the wire. APPRAISAL chased three wide, got floated five wide in upper stretch, and stayed on for a
minor reward. PILOT PRINCE stalked along the inside, shifted four wide in upper stretch, but failed to produce a bid before tiring. LOAD UP MOE saved
ground far off o fthe pace, and passed tired foes through the lane. NIP N TUCK shifted from the two path to the five path turning for home, but failed to
factor. CLEARLY MAD dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but weakened in upper stretch. ROLL TYLER was outrun. ME WE was caught four
wide around the turn while off of the pace, and weakened.
