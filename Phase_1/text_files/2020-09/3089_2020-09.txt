Footnotes
SHOOT YOUR CUFFS chased the early pace off the rail, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain
and drew off inside the furlong marker. GALICENO tracked the pace well back, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane
and closed well for the place. SHARP'S FLASH mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out late for
clear racing room and edged up for the show. JUST A JOKER sprinted to a long lead soon after the start, held that margin to the lane, then weakened late
and held a share. LUCKY UNLUCKY allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and improved his
position. COPPER CADDY allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong.
STORMBIRD'S SONG was never involved.

stretch, then angled around a tiring rival, made a steady gain and edged up in the final strides. PRETTY CHARLEE tracked the pace, saved ground through
the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, gained a short lead, then was outfinished. SNIPER SIS allowed to settle, moved up on the two
path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up for the show. CAMBIUM allowed to settle, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and got up for a share. SPICY HOT well placed and outside, held position four wide through
the turn, bid on that path into the lane and evened out. MAIN LINK mid pack, moved up while angling out through the turn, came four wide into the lane and
flattened out. MOZA bumped after the start, passed tiring rivals. KEEP YOUR THOUGHTS rated inside, angled out and moved up three wide through the
turn, bid on that path into the lane and faded. ALLGOTUPTODANCE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the

Footnotes
SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin to the lane, then drifted out badly under right hand urging and drew
off. GRANDGRAN tracked the pace, angled out and moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, then could not threaten the
winner and held the place. FELON NO MORE mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, flattened out and held the
show. QUARTERMASTER broke awkwardly from the gate, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and
weakened in the drive. BIJEMINI SLEW ran evenly. GAMBLER ROCKET rated back early, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch and faded the final furlong. BLIZZ showed little. MR. SARINANA was no factor.
