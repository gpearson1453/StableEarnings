KNIGHT COMMANDER stalked, was outpaced leaving the turn, responded in the stretch and wore down JUSTA STREAK. The latter seized command from
the outset, edged clear leaving the turn, resisted stubbornly but was worn down. STORMIN' J. J. chased while three wide, moved four wide into the stretch
and finished well. SUBSTITUTION was sluggish at the start and proved no factor. TITAN'S REVENGE raced in striking position while three wide and faded.

Footnotes
LOUISE THE LASER set a contested pace, held well into the stretch and dug in gamely to fend off STAR HUNTER. The latter saved ground, was angled
three wide into the stretch and finished well. DAAHERACHEL forced the pace and stayed on well in the stretch. BYE LOVE GOTTA GO settled well, moved
closer on the turn, went four wide into the stretch and rallied strongly. NURSE LIST chased while four wide and lacked a rally. GLOBAL EXCHANGE failed
to threaten. BRAVE DISH was awkward at the start and no factor.

PINSON stalked the pace, outpaced leaving the far turn, responded gamely and was up in time. TAKE CHARGE NOW seized command, edged clear
leaving the far turn and was reeled in late. GALINDO chased while three wide, advanced on the far turn, moved four wide into the stretch and kept on.
CAROUSE saved ground, remained inside for the stretch run and lacked the needed bid. MIGHTY GHOST never menaced. BOW AND ARROW was void
of speed. IN THE DEEP dropped back early.

Footnotes
S C ANGEL raced in striking position, went three wide into the stretch and finished well. HALEYS HEIST dueled early, lost her position on turn and stayed
on in the stretch. WHO'S THE DIVA NOW led early, pulled away on the turn and was reeled in during the stretch run. GIGGLES AND SMOKE never
menaced. JUST SPLENDID passed tired ones. VAGARY stumbled at the start and did not factor. TOWN TATTLER was always outrun. NAPILI showed
little. SILVER TURNS GOLD was never involved.
