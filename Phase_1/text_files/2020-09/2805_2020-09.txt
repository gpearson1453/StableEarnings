KITTY'S CANDY was on the pace in the two path to the stretch then pushed away to mid stretch and held driving. COLD BREW KELLY pressed the winner
to the turn, moved up to challenge into the stretch but was outrun to mid stretch while well clear of the others. PENNER PARTY had no speed, was two wide
on the turn but never a threat. MOONS OVER MEXICO also had no speed, swung four wide into the stretch but also was not a factor. RAIL HOG hustled to
show speed to the turn then dropped back and gave out in the drive.

PURE PERFECTION pressed the pace to the half, was two wide and rallied up to take over on the second turn, edged clear to mid stretch and held off her
stable partner under steady urging. LACEY'S RAINBOW never far back though trailing, bid two wide on the second turn then finished willingly for the place.
NORTHERN ROSE was settled to the half, circled three wide while rallying into the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch then hung. BARBELLO (NZ) had
no speed, chased to the second turn then was not a threat in the drive. SOMARA pushed to the front, set the pace for five furlongs then was overtaken and
weakened.

while easily second best. ON THE WINGS OF trailed for six furlongs while two wide then could not offer the needed late response. CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT
