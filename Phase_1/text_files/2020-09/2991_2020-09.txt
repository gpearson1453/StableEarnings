Footnotes
LAWN DART sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin to the late going and held under steady pressure. WHERE YOU WAS allowed to
settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and closed well for the place. STORM ADVISORY allowed to
settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out and closed well for the show. MA DE TAW chased the pace,
held position three wide through the turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, then weakened and held a share. OLDZFOURFORTYTWO never far back,
moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and weakened in the drive. JEN'S SONG ran evenly for a half and had no rally.
