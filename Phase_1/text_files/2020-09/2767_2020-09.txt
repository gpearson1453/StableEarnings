Footnotes
SPOT ON was away in good order to duel for the early advantage from the inside with STAY IN GRACE, disposed of that rival with a furlong to run and
drew off with complete authority. STAY IN GRACE broke sharply to duel with the winner while racing three-wide, could not match strides with that rival
through the final furlong but finished well to be clearly second best. B C Z MIDDLETON settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn and
finished evenly late. JERRE TO CARRIE raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. SASSY DEBS
FIREFLY was off slow and lagged throughout.

RIPTIDE ROMEO dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and was ridden out to the wire to be kept to task.
TIZASTONE pressed the pace from the inside, stayed on in the drive, was no match for the winner but clearly second best. FLAT OUT FEISTY was away in
good order to dispute the pace with the winner while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. SONGBIRD EYDIE lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BIG DOG was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. HALO HERO
broke in the air and lagged throughout.

DOCTOR BRUCE S. was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and was fully
extended to hold off the closing DREAMCATCHER by a diminishing margin. DREAMCATCHER raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn
and was gaining on the winner late. THIS GREAT NATION bobbled at the break then was allowed to settle, raced six-wide through the turn and finished
with good late energy. DON'TBESHYWILLIE disputed the pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. DUDLEY STUDLEY was bumped at
the start, dueled for the early advantage while racing three-wide and gave way through the final eighth. LIL' CHIEFTAIN was bumped at the break, chased
the leaders from the inside for three furlongs and weakened.

SO LUCKY sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. MALIBU BAY tracked the winner from the inside
throughout, could not reach the rival in the drive but was clearly second best. GOLDEN COWBOY broke sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide
and gradually gave way. MIKE MAN'S GOLD settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly.
FAR WEST was off a step slow, lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. DANGERSMYMIDDLNAME lacked early foot, saved
ground through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FORTUNE'S FREUDE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear lead with a quarter to run and drew off through the
lane. SEMI SWEET raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and finished with good
energy to gain the place. GAZING was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position but failed
to gain late. LITTLE DANCER showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn and finished evenly late. SHE CHERIE pressed the pace
while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. TESLA chased the leaders while racing four-wide, moved five-wide through the second
turn and weakened after going five furlongs. FORTUNE IN SILK raced five-wide through both turns, lacked early speed and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
GOLD CRUSHER sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane as a
handy winner. UNMACHABLE was bumped at the break, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, remained inside for the drive, could
not gain on the winner but finished well to gain the place. MUNCEY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn,
angled in with a furlong to run and finished willingly. FANTASTIC DAY raced five-wide through both turns, settled off the leaders and finished evenly. VINNY
FROM DIXIE was bumped at the break, raced off the leaders from between foes. moved three-wide through the second turn and did not menace.
HARBORS RULE chased the leaders from the inside and weakened through the final furlong. LOLO PANIOLO raced off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the second turn and gradually weakened. CRITERION showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a
factor. TIG chased the leaders for five furlongs and weakened.

Footnotes
PRINCESS OF CAIRO was reserved just off the leaders early, advanced four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew
off with complete authority. DAFFODIL SWEET sprinted clear before going a quarter, saved ground while setting the pace, could not match strides with the
winner through the final furlong but was clearly second best. AUTUMN ARRIVES was never far back, raced five-wide through the second turn and failed to
gain on the top pair in the drive. WINDY POINT was off a step slow, lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace. SHE
OWNS THE PAYNT chased the leaders while racing four-wide for six furlongs and weakened. FOR YOU ONLY raced four-wide through the first turn,
showed no early speed and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
LANSKY pressed the pace of HARDTO DENY from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and drew off through the lane as a handy
winner. HARD TO DENY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up from between foes to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths pole, gained a slight
advantage, was no match for the winner in the drive but held the place. SPITTIN IMAGE pressed the paced from between foes, steadied sharply nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths marker and finished with good courage. WICKED
WINNINGS lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. RAISE THE WOOF was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide
through the turn and failed to gain late. FROLIC AND DETOUR showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. LOCHNESS
was away in good order to set a pressured pace and weakened after going a half.

FRIENDSWITHBOURBON sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with little need of urging.
THUNDERBOLT S. broke out, chased the winner while racing three-wide, could not gain om that foe in the drive but finished well to hold the place. EASY
DOES IT broke in a tangle, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy.
CANCALE was bumped at the start, steadied from between foes soon after, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished willingly.
MAYBEE A DIVA was off slow, raced just off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn and failed to menace. FOUR SCORE settled off the leaders
early, moved five-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. I'VE ALWAYS SAID was bumped at the break, chased the leaders while racing four-wide
for a half and weakened.
