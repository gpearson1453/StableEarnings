Footnotes
ATONE dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch and into the turn, pulled clear from the two path nearing the five sixteenths pole, and continued
to draw away in the stretch, winning geared down and proving to be much the best. RULE FOLLOWER stumbled leaving the gate, recovered to chase the
leaders up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path approaching the three eighths pole and chased the winner home, proving to be no match to that
rival. SINGASONGSAM tracked the leaders on the inside early, dropped back to race in the middle of the pack up what remained of the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the two path and made a mild gain of ground in the stretch. SPECIAL PRYCE bobbled slightly leaving the gate, raced off the pace
up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. SMART TRIAL stumbled slightly leaving the gate, trailed the
field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. CANYONS BOY dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and into the
turn, saved ground around the turn, began to tire approaching the five sixteenths pole and continued to fade in the stretch.

Footnotes
RELEASE THE HEAT was placed on the lead, dictated terms in the two to three path on the turn while clear, came into the lane in the three path, increased
her advantage under a drive, went to hand urging late and continued to increase her advantage. PRESENT OF HERO tracked well behind the leading pair,
was pushed along while saving ground through the turn, was driven along the rail into the lane, went two wide midstretch and got up for place late. REND
LAKE BABY broke inward and bumped HIDDEN FIGURE in the opening strides, tracked the leader while racing keenly early, continued well off the
pacesetter while racing in the three path on the turn, chased on inside down the lane while proving no match for the pacesetter, and lost place late.
SHARPERTHANME tracked well behind the leading pair while racing outside of PRESENT OF HERO early, settled back to midpack outside of AMAZING
ANNIE past the five eighths, was taken three wide past the five eighths, floated into the lane in the five path, and chased on mildly five wide. AMAZING
ANNIE settled near the rear inside of RARE ACTION ATTACK, chased inside of SHARPERTHANME into the turn, bid outside of PRESENT OF HERO past
the three eighths, came into the lane in the three to four path, and was outfinished three wide. HIDDEN FIGURE was bumped soundly by REND LAKE

SUNSHINE LINE grazed the inside door of the gate on the way out but seemed unperturbed, soon led, was engaged from the outside by BIG WIN near the
three eighths while racing in the two path, briefly vied inside of her, kicked away into the lane, and drew off under a drive while racing slightly greenly. BACK
IT UP chased the leading pair in the four path on the turn, came into the lane under a drive, split horses near the three sixteenths, never threatened the
winner but finished best of the rest. ABBMAR was bumped by CHICHI RIVICHE in the opening strides, settled inside at the rear of the main group, hugged
the rail around the bend and into the lane, proved no match for SUNSHINE LINE, and was outfinished for place. BIG WIN tracked the leader into the turn,
engaged to her outside near the three eighths, vied to the quarter, was turned back into the lane, and flattened out three wide. CHICHI RIVICHE stumbled at
the break, came in and bumped ABBMAR as she regained her footing, dropped to the rear, was driven in the five path on the turn, and mustered no bid.

Footnotes
SUPERSTAR DIVA raced at the inside of the tracking flight down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, raced into the lane between horses in
close range of the leader, went to a drive past the three sixteenths, reeled the leader in through the final furlong and led to her outside in the last jumps.
LADY MAGNA pressed the pace outside of PROBABLY GRACE, took the lead at the seven sixteenths, maintained a narrow advantage while racing in the
two to three path around the rest of the bend, cleared in upper stretch, but could not hold off SUPERSTAR DIVA in the final strides. HELEN MAE'S SONG
tracked three wide early, was pushed along three wide on the turn, turn into the lane under a drive while still three wide, chased on outside of SUPERSTAR
DIVA to midstretch but flattened out in the final furlong. DUSTY MILLER chased midpack, saved ground on the turn, came into the lane under a drive in the
three path, and kept on while proving no match for the top three. TRUE TO JEANINE trailed early, continued toward the rear while saving ground on the
turn, came into the lane in the three path, and chased on willingly in the lane. PROBABLY GRACE set the early pace while taking pressure from LADY
MAGNA to her outside, was headed by that foe at the seven sixteenths, urged to keep pace with that foe while saving ground on the turn, proved no match
into the lane and weakened inside under a drive. THIRSTY COWGIRL came away with the field, settled at the rear past the five eighths, raced in the five
path on the turn, was driven into the lane in the seven path, and had no rally. NO TIME TO PLAY chased near the center of the track early, continued
toward the rear in the four path on the turn, and made no bid. ANNIE TIME GIRL tracked the pace between horses, began to weaken from the seven
sixteenths, lost ground in the three to four path on the turn, was driven in the six path into the lane, but proved empty.

Footnotes
HEISFANCY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path near the five sixteenths pole, dropped in on the
rail at the three sixteenths pole, took the lead with a furlong to go and increased his win margin to the wire while kept to the task. FREAKIN JOE chased the
leader in the early going, raced in the two path around the turn, moved up to challenge near the five sixteenths pole, dueled in upper stretch, and could not
go with the winner but was the best of the rest. MAGI tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path around the turn,
gained ground in upper stretch and finished evenly. WELLFIELD raced off the pace between horses in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn
and gained ground late from the rail in the stretch. IDAHO TORNADO led the field through the opening half mile, saved ground around the turn and
weakened in the final furlong while drifting out in late stretch. RED PRINCE raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the
three path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. BOLD ATTACK tracked the leader on the inside early, raced in the three path around the turn and faded
in the stretch. TSALI stalked the leader between horses through the opening quarter mile, raced in the two path around the turn and tired in the stretch.
DAWN'S ROAD trailed the field on the inside early, came around the turn in the four path, still at the back of the pack, and was never a factor.

Footnotes
ISABELLACANNETELLA was keen to the lead, took pressure from CHOLLA to her outside past the eleven sixteenths, edged clear approaching the half,
settled better in the two path on the turn, and steadily increased her advantage under a mild drive in the lane. LOOKTHEOTHERWAY was away near the
front and raced keenly early, got taken back past the five eighths to track the leading pair, was taken out to the three path on the turn, was driven into the
lane while still in the three path, proved no match for ISABELLACANNETELLA but kept on earnestly to prove best of the rest. DARLIN ROSIE chased two
wide, improved position when pushed along near the five sixteenths, dropped to the inside to turn for home, proved no match for the winner into the lane,
chased under a drive inside but could not hold the place. LIL BIT TIPSEY had her head down when the gates opened and missed the start by several
strides, settled at the rear, raced in the two to three path in the rear group around the bend, went to a drive between horses in upper stretch and passed
between tired horses. SHOWIT chased three wide, was driven three wide into the lane, and proved empty four wide in the stretch. CHOLLA raced near the
rear in the opening furlong, pulled to press outside of ISABELLACANNETELLA past the eleven sixteenths, tracked two wide into the turn, continued in range
in the four path on the bend, was driven into the lane in the four path and weakened three wide. LITTLE SNIP raced close up inside early while fighting her
rider hard, was wrangled back toward the rear inside past the three quarters, saved ground near the rear on the turn and into the lane, and came up empty.
