CITY CHAMP was away a step slow but was used to stay in contention, rallied three wide to t he stretch then finished strong to win going away. CALL SIGN
LUCKY was quickest and set the pace to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, pushed away to mid stretch but tired badly and could not hold. TWO TERMS
had no speed, raced three then four wide to the stretch but could not threaten in the drive. BIG ERROR was chasing to the turn, shifted off the rail and was
two wide into the stretch then also did not rally. SWEET BAGS stalked to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but came up empty when roused. FLIGHT
SPEED pressed the pace two wide to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. EDWARD T. trailed throughout.

FINAL DEMAND was well placed off the leader, raced two wide to the stretch, got to terms in mid stretch but could not shake loose until inside the sixteenth
marker and held determinedly. COMMISSIONESS was outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide between rivals to the stretch then finished willingly to grab
the place. WAY TOO SWEET set the pace from the rail to the stretch, dug in stubbornly when hooked by the winner in mid stretch but was tiring in the final
sixteenth. MAMANUCA chased the pace to the turn, was off the rail to the stretch then shifted out but finished evenly. LYDIA O LYDIA stalked the pace two
wide to the stretch then failed to offer a closing response. GOTHIC GIRL broke a bit slow, trailed then had to circle four wide on the turn and gave way in the
final furlong.

SURFACE never far back to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, rallied inside in the drive and prevailed. ONLY THE FACTS set the pace while off
the rail on both turns, was collared in mid stretch but battled on late to save second. LAKAYA steadied off heels into the first turn, was outrun to the half,
circled five wide to the stretch and was gaining ground late. GOLDEN GODDESS pressed the pace to the second turn while three wide, rallied to engage
ONLY THE FACTS for the lead in mid stretch but tired in the late stages. KISS OF CONGRATS checked off heels into the first turn, chased to the second
turn, was two wide to the stretch, remained a factor to mid stretch then flattened. HOLY ZAGS was also chasing the pace, got fanned four wide on the
second turn and tired in the drive. BIG MINX had no speed and was not a factor. FOREHEAD KISSES trailed for six furlongs then stopped in the stretch,
was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
KUDA HURAA was hustled to contest the pace, saved ground then pushed away from TIZ THE STANDARD to mid stretch and held driving. TIZ THE
STANDARD stalked the winner early, moved up three wide to engage for the lead but was outkicked in upper stretch then battled on to save the place.
ROYAL DANIELLE pressed the pace early, dropped back inside on the turn but finished willingly in the final furlong. CHARLIE'S A. T. M. had no speed, was
caught out four deep to the stretch then showed some late interest. PAPA SAID YA chased the winner three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid
stretch and did not rally. PACIFIC SILENCE stalked to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch but weakened in mid stretch. PERFECT MOOD was
outsprinted early, got fanned four wide to the stretch and also lacked a closing response. SWEET HUSSAR chased the pace from off the rail to the stretch
then came up empty in the drive. AFTER SUNDOWN had no speed, was three wide then drifted out widest into the stretch but bore in under right handed
whipping, cut off CROOKHAVEN LASS nearing the furlong marker then bore in again to bounce off the rail at the eighth pole and finished evenly.
CROOKHAVEN LASS had no speed, was two wide to the stretch then had to steady sharply when cut off by AFTER SUNDOWN in mid stretch and came
up empty. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident in mid stretch and disqualified AFTER SUNDOWN, placing her behind CROOKHAVEN
LASS.

Footnotes
SCHERZO (GB) never far back, circled four wide while rallying on the second turn, pushed to the front in mid stretch and edged clear driving. LEMON
DROP TINI trailed to the second turn, was roused and advanced four wide to the stretch then finished in a steady rally. TOO HOT FOR CURLIN had no
speed, was two wide on the second turn then closed some ground late. WITH OPEN EYES tracked to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then was
outrun to mid stretch and finished evenly. DIAMETRIC attended the pace outside a rival, responded to mid stretch then tired. LA GATA ELEGANTE settled
mid pack to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing bid. TSUNAMI SPRING hustled to contest the pace from the rail to the
stretch then was outkicked and tired. KATSAROS settled for a half mile, had to circle five wide on the far turn and flattened out in mid stretch. TRULY
FABULOUS had no speed, raced three or four wide throughout and was not a factor. GET'EM TIGER stalked the pace to the second turn, made a bid three
wide to loom a threat to the stretch but tired and gave out.

JIMMY D was unhurried to the second turn, raced two wide then shifted out for room into the stretch, rallied when clear and closed fast to be along in time.
SEAU attended the pace to the second turn, responded to mid stretch, took a brief lead in deep stretch but could not stall the winner. ARMOUR PLATE
contested the pace inside SEAU, saved ground and dueled to mid stretch, battled on late then was outfinished. SAYIN GRACE settled mid pack to the
second turn, saved ground to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch then came up empty. IMPLICITLY tracked the pace to the second turn, was three
wide to the stretch, also loomed to mid stretch then weakened. PIONEEROFTHESTORM chased the pace to the second turn then was caught behind
horses in traffic to the stretch and could not regain momentum once clear. MAD AT MONEY had no speed and was not a factor. JIMMY G settled mid pack,
bid three then four wide on the second turn but gave way after six furlongs. MO BOB (IRE) lugged out on the first turn then was eased by the rider on the
backstretch but crossed the wire and was walked off.

Footnotes
JUST LIKE FRED was a pace factor to the second turn while inside, shifted out and was three wide into the stretch, rallied between rivals through a long
drive and got the nod for the win. KALINE stalked the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide to engage the leaders into the stretch, dueled determinedly
through the final furlong and was nipped on the line. FOUR O'FIVE was chasing to the half, got fanned four wide to the stretch but pushed up to contest the
advantage, battled stubbornly in the final sixteenth but missed. ISLAND HEAT had no speed, trailed to the second turn, was also four wide to the stretch
then could not close the gap on the top three. HEAVENLY TIGER also had no speed, settled to the second turn then saved ground to the stretch but lacked
a closing response. PEACE IN THE EAST had no speed and was never a threat. GREGS CITY ZIP hustled to dispute the pace two wide for six furlongs
then tired. UP TIME settled mid pack to the half, was off the rail on the far turn but gave way in the stretch.
