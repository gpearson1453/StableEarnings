TAMING THE TIGRESS stalked outside a rival early, closed in around the turn and headed the leader at the five-sixteenths, dueled with ALLIE'S PAL in the
lane, took over with a furlong to go and moved clear late. ALLIE'S PAL sped clear and opened up a comfortable lead early, challenged around the turn and
dug in to meet that bid, fought back from the inside through the lane and yielded grudgingly. CLUBHOUSE SAINT settled off the pace, angled four wide and
entered the stretch outside a rival and kept on to best the rest. BINGOS SYSTEM broke out, settled off the rail, went four around the turn and lacked a
serious bid. DARING CAT chased three wide into the lane and failed to rally. MO BRANDI raced off the pace near the fence, moved out into the two path on
the turn and was never a factor. COMMAS SAVE LIVES off a bit slow to begin, raced a bit green in the early going, chased four to five wide around the turn
and was always outrun.

COALINGA ROAD stalked a bit off the inside, chased two wide into the lane, came with a late bid outside the leader and took over late under a strong drive.
COUNT ALEXEI had good early speed to take command, angled to the rail, led clear past the eighth pole but could not hold off the winner. MASTER RYAN
hopped and came away slowly at the start, settled early off the rail, went two wide into the turn then angled to the rail, came out and looked to rally between
the top pair but lacked room late and stayed on for a clear third. CHIPPER broke out and bumped rival, tracked the pace up the backstretch, went two to
three wide into the lane then angled out and showed a mild response to edged rival for a minor award. R MATINEIGH IDOL bumped from the inside at the
start, stalked outside a rival then three wide into the stretch and flattened out. EL CHAPIN raced four wide into the turn then angled into the two path and
proved no menace. WHISPERING FLAME trailed the field to the turn, angled in around the bend, tipped out entering the drive, drifted in then back out in the
stretch and showed little. PAUL L traveled along the inside to the stretch and tired. HAND TIMED.

TIZ TOFFEE vied three deep to the stretch, cleared in the lane and held well over the runner-up. EASY GRADER chased off the rail then between foes on
the turn, came three wide into the stretch, tipped out in the lane, rallied outside the winner but lacked the needed late punch. GIVE ME A HINT off a bit
slowly to start, chased near the inside into the turn, moved a bit off the rail around the bend, rallied in the final furlong and outkicked WINSINFASHION for
third. WINSINFASHION vied between rivals for command to the stretch, could not match the winner in the final furlong and got nailed for the show.
INCREDIBLY LUCKY vied for the lead from inside and weakened in the final furlong. JUST GRACE stumbled and bumped hard from the inside leaving the
gate, settled off the pace, came five wide into the stretch and never made an impact. FLYING BUSINESS chased outside a rival then four wide around the
bend, drifted out at the eighth pole and lacked a bid. STURDY ONE knocked into rival hard at the start, tracked off the rail then angled in entering the stretch
and could not rally. CHAY UP AND AWAY veered out and bumped rival leaving the gate, stalked off the rail then three deep on the turn and weakened in
the lane. MIZ TIANJIN off slow to start, trailed the field early, angled out on the turn then came out further in the lane and was never a factor. AFTER A
REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT CHAY UP AND AWAY DID VEERED OUT AND FORCED STURDY ONE INTO JUST GRACE AT THE START
BUT SINCE CHAY UP AND AWAY FINISHED BEHIND BOTH RIVALS THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
LADY ON ICE stalked the pacesetter near the inside, bid alongside into the turn, dueled around the bend, kicked clear under a drive and widened under
strong handling late. IT'S A RIDDLE chased outside a rival, exited the bend four wide, rallied inside VANGOGO and gained the place. VANGOGO hustled to
the front, dueled outside a rival on the turn, could not keep up into the drive, drifted out through the lane and flattened out. MISS MOZART shifted out and
bumped rival at the start, raced off the inside then angled in on the turn and improved position. SHE B SALTY steered to the inside, saved ground into the
lane, moved out in the stretch and also improved position. SAVE THE STORY stumbled leaving the gate, tracked four wide into the turn, moved in and
traveled two or three wide into the stretch and failed to respond to urging. CALIFORNIA COOL bumped leaving the gate, in range while outside a rival,
chased the top pair four wide to the stretch and weakened. I'M SO ADORABLE trailed the field early near the inside, moved out a bit on the turn, angled out
further in the lane and never threatened. SECOND AVENUE bumped at the start, traveled mid-pack early, entered the stretch five wide and never rallied.
FOG LIFTER broke in and bumped at the start, traveled near the rear of the field, stayed off the inside to the lane and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
COMMANDER KHAI spec clear and set the pace early, inched away around the bend, urged a few times right-handed in the drive and drew away under
strong handling. MAC DADDY TOO chased a bit off the rail then moved to the rail, cut the corner into the stretch and bested the rest. STRATOFORTRESS
tracked the pace from inside, angled out into the stretch, steered out at the sixteenth pole and finished with late interest. REFI NOW forwardly placed off the
inside, angled into the two path around the turn, chased between foes in the lane and lost the show. FREEDOM FLYER bumped and bobbled at the start,
stalked the leader up the backstretch, kept inside through the turn, lacked room through the drive, gained a clear path in deep stretch but lacked room again
and steadied late. RUN SNAPPY off slow to begin, advanced to the turn, chased three deep in the drive and flattened. SANTOS TO WILSON away slowly
at the the start, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. GHOSTER tracked the pace then checked near the half-mile marker, steered to the
inside and came up empty in the stretch. FLACTEM LEGACY broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, saved ground to the stretch and was never a
factor. LOCHINVAR (GER) off slow, angled to the inside, angled out into the stretch and proved no menace. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
AWESOME DRIVE tossed head and was off a bit slow, pulled early from the inside, moved a bit off the rail and steadied past the five-sixteenths marker,
came out into the stretch, closed fast and nailed the runner-up. A G INDY sped clear early to set the pace, inched away leaving the backstretch, widened
around the far turn, stayed clear through the drive but weakened late and was caught by the winner. LITTLE BIRD (IRE) tracked off the rail, three deep into
the lane, finished well in the final furlong and was gaining to the wire. LUCIA'S DESIGN off alertly then dropped back, settled off the pace, checked past the
five-sixteenths pole, summoned a mild response and gained a minor award. WHITE VELVET stalked outside a rival then between foes into the drive and
lacked a bid. SABINOS PRIDE raced three deep early then steadied leaving the first turn, chased outside a rival then three wide into the lane, bothered by
rival at the sixteenth pole and weakened. BREAKFAST BALL stalked outside the leader, angled in on the second turn, saved ground into the lane and also
weakened. NOCHERYLIKEMYCHERY angled to the rail and stalked inside, checked past the five-sixteenths pole, stayed inside to the stretch and could not
regain momentum. HAND TIMED.

GOOD WITH PEOPLE bumped from the inside leaving the gate, set the pace up the backstretch, inched away past the five-sixteenths pole, urged
left-handed inside the eighth pole and held late. TOUCHDOWN BROWN stalked the leader off the inside, lost ground around around the turn and entered
the stretch three wide, came back at the leader in the final furlong but was too late. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES broke out and bumped leaving the gate, up
close inside the leader early, lost contact with the leader past the five-sixteenths pole, angled out with a furlong to go and secured the show. PAPPY
BOYINGTON turned his head and was off slow to begin, tracked off the rail through the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MULLIGAN chased between foes, steadied briefly early, angled in and saved ground to the lane, came out in upper stretch, closed fast and edged clear. VA
VA VOOM up close outside the top pair, dueled with SWEET SONNY around the turn and into the stretch, battled through the lane and led late, put away
SWEET SONNY but could not fend off MULLIGAN in the final sixteenth. BELLA CHICA allowed to settle then altered out around troubled rival early, chased
two wide into the stretch, moved out a path in the drive and earned the show. SWEET SONNY dueled for command with QUEEN STORMBORN then
dueled with VA VA VOOM around the bend and into the stretch, fought back gamely through the final furlong and yielded grudgingly. COVER VERSION
traveled near the back of the field, exited the turn three wide, angled out in upper stretch and summoned a mild late bid. SIENA SILK broke in and bumped
rival at the start, cut the corner into the stretch and showed a mild response. SHE LOVES KARAOKE tracked off the inside, steadied briefly early, went two
wide into the stretch and never made an impact. AWESOME GALAXY bumped leaving the gate, came three wide into the stretch and weakened.
POMEGRANATE chased three wide to the lane and never rallied. CHARMING LIFE threw head and was off slow at the beginning, altered out early, trailed
the field into the stretch and was never a factor. QUEEN STORMBORN dueled for the lead early, shifted in and jumped the rail early, losing the rider in the
process, and walked off under her own power. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT QUEEN STORMBORN CAUSED HER
PROBLEMS BY SHYING FROM SWEET SONNY THEN SHIFTING INTO THE RAIL, LOSING HER RIDER IN THE PROCESS AND THERE WOULD BE
NO CHANGE. HAND TIMED.
