FUTURE ABUNDANCE settled while thee wide, advanced on the far turn, lodged a four wide rally and was up in the last jump. I AM READY AGAIN set a
contested pace, edged clear into the stretch, dug in stubbornly and was worn down late. TOUCH 'EM UP outpaced, commenced a bid on the far turn, was
angled five wide and closed ground willingly. BACK THE BLUE chased along the inside, moved three wide for the stretch run and stayed on. BIG HEARTED
FACTOR saved ground, moved closer on the far turn and lacked room in the late going. TITOCHIP never menaced. BIGSHOT LACEWELL took no part.

POINT OF IMPACT settled well, commenced his bid far on the far turn and rallied while four wide in the stretch. BEACHHEAD outpaced early, advanced on
the far turn, took over at the eighth pole but proved no match for the top one. OFF AGAIN ON AGAIN chased along the inside and stayed on. READY OR
NOT stalked the early and lacked a rally. DREAMIN FOR REAL passed tired ones. BLAME IT ON JR failed to threaten. HE'S A BIG DILL raced forwardly
while three wide and faded. KNIGHTS FORK led early and retreated. GERDY'S BOY never menaced.
