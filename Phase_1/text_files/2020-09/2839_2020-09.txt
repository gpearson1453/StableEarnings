Footnotes
RED HIERARCHY bobbled leaving the gate, pressed the pace, came three and four-wide through the turn, took command a furlong out, moved clear and
held under a hand ride. ARI GOLD SPEEDWAGN broke alertly and settled in striking range, chased two and three-wide through the turn, closed along the
second path in the stretch, split horses in the final 16th and surged up for second place. SOUPER HOT dueled with HURRICANE DANCER from the outset,
battled two and three-wide on the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch, launched a bid but was outkicked then lost place late.. ELEKTRONIC stalked
the duelers on the backstretch, chased angling from the rail to two wide late turn then finished gamely. HURRICANE DANCER dueled from the rail, took
command at the top of the stretch but was passed a furlong out and faded. JAMMIN STILL broke outward and settled at the back of the pack, was hustled
along the rail through the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch and flattened out.

Footnotes
JACOBS CALL emerged from the pack with a clear early lead, set a reserved pace, was hustled the into stretch then held under a steady drive.
PRICELESS WILL settled in mid pack, chased two-wide late turn and finished under a determined drive. CANOLA WORLD stalked the pace, was hustled
two then three-wide late turn and chased through the stretch. SEVENTH WONDER stalked the pacesetter, was hustled along the rail on the turn, chased
into the stretch but evened out in the final 16th. BURNING LOVE settled in mid pack, chased hard three-wide late turn then finished gamely. KEEN
SAMURAI broke outward then settled off the pace, was hustled on the turn then finished evenly. CHASING VINNY raced in mid pack, was roused along the
rail leaving the turn and lacked a closing response. SEA SCOUT was steadied when KEEN SAMURAI broke in from of him, veered to the inside,
straightened away and chased from off the pace then flattened out in the stretch.

LUCKY GIRASOL settled off the pace, came three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, swept to the lead in the final 16th and finished under a
hand ride. RINCE TAPAIGH, in range, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn, rallied, bid a 16th out but was outkicked. WESTLODGE INTRIGUE showed
speed, shook clear approaching the turn, set the pace, was passed with a 16th to run and evened out. SAN NICOLA STORM was pinched back early and
was taken off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, was blocked upper stretch then rallied when clear. BELLA NINA raced from off the
pace, was hustled four-wide late turn then closed belatedly. BURBANK ROAD forced the pace, dogged the leader on the turn but flattened out in the late
stages. VEIL, in range, chased three-wide into the stretch, launched an all out drive, moved to the rail late but evened out. YES PLEASE, in range, was
hustled four-wide on the late turn then evened out in the final 16th. AIRY FAIRY pressed the pace, stalked from the rail on the turn, was close up in the

Footnotes
LOOKIN TO STRIKE broke out at the start, cruised up to stalk the leaders three wide into the turn, was given his cue to bid and collared the top pair,
zoomed by in upper stretch and widened, kept to his task with a solid margin late. STORMFUHR chased the three pace makers along the inside, angled out
in upper stretch to drive into the place position and was hard pressed to hold that spot late. CIRCLE OF FRIENDS was steadied when the winner came over
early on, dropping back to trail where he stayed until angling out and rallying two to four wide on the turn and into the six path turning for home, closing well
late, particularly in the final seventy yards to threaten for the place spot. PERFECT SPEIGHTY stalked the leader early, had a brief lead after bidding for the
front midway on the turn but was taken on immediately and passed by the winner, staying on for a minor award. CORDUROY ROAD was herded out at the
start, moved up four wide into range late backstretch and through the turn, but could only inch up down the stretch. WILE E PEYOTE was herded out at the
start, came into range three to four wide on the turn but could only rally past a few stragglers in the stretch. IKERRIN ROAD (IRE) was in mid pack on the
rail into the turn, hustled and asked to move up, rallied mildly into mid pack but had nothing left for the stretch drive. EXPLORATIONIST sprinted clear, was
stalked and pressed late backstretch and headed mid turn, dropping back and fading out in the final furlong. THE RIDER OF CIRCLE OF FRIENDS
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER SHORTLY AFTER THE START. AFTER REVIEW, THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED THE CLAIM OF FOUL.

DECIMATOR raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn, bid upper stretch, shook clear then held sway under a hand ride. GIANT WATERS
bumped by SUIGU STAR at the start, settled off the pace, was steadied late turn, chased into the stretch and finished all out. LIL BIT GANGSTA showed
brief speed, stalked the pace, closed four and five-wide on the turn, failed with a bid upper stretch and chased to the end. LIARS CLUB showed brief speed,
stalked the pace, closed two to four-wide on the turn, inherited the lead approaching the top of the stretch, was headed mid stretch and gave way. SUIGU
STAR bumped with horses on both sides leaving the gate, settled off the pace, closed, checked late turn to avoid a rival dropping back, chased into the
stretch but ran into traffic and evened out. DRONE SWARM broke outward and settled off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn, angled out in
the stretch but evened out late. NO EXIT was involved in some bumping at the outset, raced in mid pack along the rail, chased into the stretch, was up close
mid stretch but flattened out. POUROSO, in mid pack early, came four to six-wide through the turn, closed but was lugging in through the stretch and
flattened out. ROYAL BOURBON settled off the pace, was hustled on the turn, veered out to avoid a rival in distress then lacked a rally. CUMPLEANOS
broke outward, sprinted to the lead, set the pace, was eased late turn, did not finish and was vanned off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUN
THROUGH THE TURN LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

Footnotes
SOUPER MUNNINGS bore out at the start but had control and the rail quickly, was challenged as the field hit the stretch but got separation again at the
eighth pole, then held on with two rivals on her flank at the wire. IN MY OPINION sat along the rail in mid pack, followed a rival who took on the winner
turning for home before angling out in upper stretch inside the eventual show finisher and closed well to make it interesting in the final seventy yards.
GOSPEL HILL steadied outside when in behind rivals down the backside, still on hold two to three wide on the turn and shifted inside drifting rivals as they
turned for home, closing outside the place finisher to make it three in a line at the wire. BELIEVING got a nice rail trip in behind the winner, angled out and
bid for the front turning for home but was on her wrong lead and shifting about, tiring and falling back in the final furlong. UNWANTED INPUT was asked to
stalk the leader down the backside inside another rival, still hustling late on the turn when drifting out, dropping back in upper stretch and fading out in the
final furlong. RUMPUS was three wide stalking the leader, roused three to four wide around the turn but was herded out nearing the top of the stretch and
levelled off down the lane. KNEW AS A BREEZE trailed the field into the turn and lost contact with the field late turn and down the stretch. TOTAL BETTY
was quickly back to the rear of the field and caught the pack into the turn but dropped out of it by the stretch run.

stalked the pace, came two-wide through the turn, bid upper stretch and drew clear then was all out but was caught on the wire. WALTZING CHAMP closed
up the rail but was in tight quarters at the turn and steadied, stalked to the stretch, rallied gamely but was outkicked. STRIKE THE TOP raced in mid pack,
closed three and four-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. VOLTAMOUR settled in mid pack, rode the rail then two-wide through the turn,
chased into the stretch and closed gamely. CANADIAN PHAROAH settled off the pace, closed four-wide late turn and finished evenly. RED MERCURY
stalked the pace, closed three-wide late turn but evened out in the late stages. LORD OF LEGENDS had speed to lead and moved clear quickly, set the
pace with a comfortable margin, was engaged upper stretch, yielded and soon retreated. DINOSAUR BEN broke badly inward, settled off the pace and

Footnotes
SPEEDY HANS got away slowly and settled off the pace, closed angling from two to four-wide through the turn, rallied, led mid stretch and widened under a
strong hand ride. BEND IN THE RIVER stalked the pace, came along the rail then two-wide on the turn, was blocked at the top of the stretch, got clear then
rallied gamely. BOKERMIN showed brief speed then forced the pace, led into the turn, dueled approaching the stretch, shook clear but was passed in mid
stretch and gave way. HAVE A SOUPER DAY settled off the pace, closed along the rail through the turn then rallied along the fence but did not menace.
SUNSPEAR stalked, bid two-wide late turn but gave way mid stretch and faded. LAST AMERICAN EXIT bobbled and then bumped HUNGARY at the start,
stalked the pace, bid late turn but failed to sustain the drive. HUNGARY, bumped at the outset, held a short lead, was headed late backstretch, chased, but
gave way late turn. NORTH BATTLEFORD settled off the pace, angled in from the fourth path to three-wide on the turn then lacked a rally.

Footnotes
KEEP YOUR WORD hit the gate leaving and settled off the pace, then closed to mid pack still on the backstretch, angled from the rail to three-wide on the
turn then rallied, had the lead in the final furlong and finished under a hand ride. OUR UNCLE DREW stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide late turn,
bumped FRAT PARTY a 16th out to gain a clear path then closed gamely. THE NEWFIE EXPRESS raced in mid pack, came three and four-wide through
the turn then rallied outside. FRAT PARTY bumped with SKIPYS LEGACY at the outset, stalked the pace, chased into the stretch, was in striking range,
was bumped a 16th out and gave way. CARL G had speed, drew clear late backstretch, set the pace, was set down upper stretch, was passed in the final
furlong and gave way grudgingly. JORDANS WAY settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then finished gamely outside. I HAVE
HOPE, in range, stalked four-wide on the turn, was bumped by KEEP YOUR WORD in the final furlong and and flattened out. AMERICAN DRIVEN
contested the lead briefly, stalked the pace from the rail, then evened out in deep stretch. SKIPYS LEGACY bumped with FRAT PARTY at the start and
settled off the pace, rode the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch then flattened out. MY LADIES' MAN settled off the pace, chased hard angling from two
to four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. KISH POINT, in range, dropped back through the turn and lacked a rally. A CLAIM OF FOUL
LODGED BY THE RIDER OF FRAT PARTY AGAINST OUR UNCLE DREW FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED.
