Footnotes
ARTISTIC MINISTRY stalked from outside a rival, went three to four wide throughout, struck a narrow lead by the three-sixteenths, was clear into upper
stretch, dug in under steady handling and just lasted. RHYTHM'N SONG raced in the back half of the field outside going four to five wide throughout, edged
closer leaving the far turn, continued to gain steadily under urging and just missed. MISS RULES was between rivals two to three wide on the first turn,
continued off the pace just off the inside, began to pick it up still two to three wide on the far turn and gained mildly. STORMY WORLD set the pace from off
the rail in the two to three path and in the clear, was challenged on the far turn still just removed from the rail, weakened thereafter. NORTHERN FERN
broke a half-step slowly, tracked from inside on or just off the rail, came out in upper stretch and was empty. PEACEOUTYOURHONOR lacked early speed,
saved ground, came out turning for home, tired.

CATS SURFIN settled off the leaders, went four wide on the turn, took aim in upper stretch, drove by late to prevail over KRIS WHO, who set the pace from
off the inside going in about the two path on the turn and in the clear, came out a bit in mid-stretch, was overtaken late but held the place. LONS OXBOW
tracked from between rivals early into the turn, continued in about the two path in behind the leader on that bend, drifted out a bit turning for home before
shifting back in, kept on well late inside. ALL TRUMPED UP switched outside the leader up the backstretch, chased three wide on the turn drifting out about
four to five wide leaving that bend, weakened in the stretch. ANOTHER BROTHER trailed early, went evenly racing mostly in the four to five path on the turn
and made no bid. SAN GIORGIO stumbled at the start, chased inside, came up empty.

Footnotes
CAMINETTO broke just a half-step slowly, stalked the leaders from outside, went four to five wide on the turn, was driven through the stretch and got up in
the final jump over CRUMAN TAPOTE, who set the pace racing outside foes with a narrow advantage, was forced four wide on the turn, just failed to last.
SIDNEY'S HOPE attended the pace three wide and between runners into the turn, kept on late and just missed. E BAR GOLD was forwardly-positioned
between runners through the turn, was slightly taken hold past the three-sixteenths, ran on evenly in the lane. WILL TELL bobbled ever so slightly at the
break, settled inside, saved ground and was not a threat. SMART SPREE contended inside runners, steadily weakened. ONE QUICK BUDDY was not a
factor racing in the three path on the turn. Following an objection by the rider of E BAR GOLD against SIDNEY'S HOPE alleging interference, no action was
taken.

Footnotes
HOLD ME ONLY attended the pace from outside, went three to four wide on the turn, given some hand urging in upper stretch and eased up late.
CHAMPITO settled in behind the leaders off the inside, went in the four to five path on the turn, was no match for the winner but secured the place.
COURAGE N ORDER broke inwardly just a bit and was urged forward, contended inside on or just off the rail, weakened. RISKY REVENGE vied between
runners two to three wide through the turn then came up empty. VEIW FROM THE BAY was not a factor racing off the rail.
