TOP HAT TREASON was unhurried inside early, advanced two wide around the turn, split rivals turning for home and quickly drew off under a drive.
CHAMPAGNE'S ON ICE vied inside of foes down the backstretch, settled back a bit inside around the turn, re-bid inside of the winner turning for home, was
no match for that foe but finished well to hold second. HAPPY GUY raced off the pace outside, went five wide around the turn, came wider into the lane, bid
widest in upper stretch but was one-paced late. MISTER MISTER pressed the pace three wide and weakened in the drive. TRAVELIN GAMBLER set the
pace two wide and tired in the lane. BLIP prompted the pace four wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
PRIDE LEADER tracked the pace from the rail, came through a large opening inside in uppers stretch and drew clear under a drive. ALIN AZUL set a
pressured pace along the rail, drew clear nearing the lane, veered out under left-handed urging in upper stretch into the eight path, straightened out under
right-handed pressure soon after and stayed on to hold second. BROAD STORM was devoid of speed while racing two wide early, circled six wide around
the far turn and rallied down the center of the track. NO SNIVELING settled off the pace inside, went two wide around the far turn, bid between foes in upper
stretch but was outkicked. OCEAN DELIGHT pressed the pace two wide and weakened in the lane. SHREW MEANING never threatened while racing three
and four wide. SO WHO'S BACK saved ground off the pace, raced three wide between foes rounding the far turn and lacked the needed rally. ROONEY
raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, made a five wide move around the far turn and failed to sustain that bid. PAZ THE WINE chased the
pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. LIVELY KITTEN stalked the pace three wide and tired. SUNDRENCHED played no factor while racing three
wide. PER RULING FROM THE DELAWARE RACING COMMISSION, PRIDE LEADER WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
SUGAR STREAK lagged well back in the two path, circled five wide around the far turn, closed outside and was up in the final strides. BOBBY'S
GOLDENGIRL pressed the pace in the three path, drew clear nearing the quarter pole, held clear to deep stretch but was run down in the final strides.
ALWAYS A QUEEN settled off the early pace while racing three wide between rivals, gained three wide between around the far turn, moved into second in
upper stretch but flattened out a bit late while besting the rest. PRETTI XTREME chased the pace four wide and lacked a rally. PAT'S NO FOOL raced in
range two wide between foes, dropped back around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. MIKO set the pace in the two path and
tired around the far turn. DAZZLE ME had some speed inside but was through after a half.

with the winner, vied inside PALATIAL TIMES through the lane for the place and prevailed in that battle. PALATIAL TIMES advanced four wide between

starting gate, raced to wide and played no factor. RELATIVE GOLD set the pace in the two path and retreated nearing the lane. THE KING AQUILES had
brief speed two wide. BI BI CARPE had some early speed, stopped, was eased, cantered across the finish line and walked off. THIS RACE WAS HAND

Footnotes
RIBBON WINNER had early speed, rated back entering the turn, raced three wide between rivals around that bend, was content to settle back as rivals
made middle moves, angled in to save some ground in the early part of the far turn, angled back out nearing the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane,
closed outside, struck the front leaving the eighth pole, switched back to the left lead and drew away under a drive. HAPPYCREST raced off the pace four
wide around the first turn, made progress down the backstretch, advanced three wide around the far turn, bid nearing the eighth pole but was no match for
the winner. FAST FIONNUALA set the pace along the rail, came out under left-handed urging near the eighth pole, straightened out and was outfinished
then was vanned off after the finish. MOSALAH lacked early speed inside, made progress inside down the backstretch, continued to save ground around
the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, was shut off near the eighth pole, angled out and made a mild gain. KITTEN'S FINEST failed to menace while racing
