Footnotes
MIRABEAU dueled from the outside early, remained engaged through the turn, shook loose at the eighth pole and proved much the best while kept to task.

TIME chased the early pace from the inside, advanced through the turn, responded entering the drive and rallied late to be just up for the show. INAWIC

remained forward for the drive but had nothing left. SQUOX could only improve position. BOSTON FLAT OUT went evenly. MAMAS GONE CRAZY dueled
from the inside and faded. HEART THAT BINDS was no factor. TOTALLY GRACE had a steady fade. SUMITUP broke in a tangle, raced green early and
was outrun.

CHU CHU'S LEGACY dueled from the inside for the early margin, battled through the turn with CREOLE CHARLIE, put that one away entering the drive,
opened a clear margin at the eighth pole and held sway. JANETS JAY JAY chased the early pace from the outside, circled rivals on the turn, responded
when asked, drifted in and out through the drive and closed with a rush for the place. CREOLE CHARLIE dueled from the outside early, remained engaged
through the turn but could not keep pace in the drive. G'WILDCAT pressed the early pace from the inside, held a forward position for the drive but had no
late response. LT. BONURA chased the early pace inside but had nothing left. CATINANDSCATIN forced the early pace outside but had no late response.
JIMMY TWO TIMES went evenly. SCHNELL was no factor. EXTRAPOLATOR was no threat. READY FOR LOVE stumbled to his knees and was no
menace. BIG MERRILL forced the early pace outside and faded.
