Footnotes
MISSING LINK took control after the start, rated along inside to the stretch, and widened under a mild drive. DOMINEERING saved ground in pursuit of
MISSING LINK early, shifted to the two-path at the top of the stretch, and ran on best of the others. BALL LIGHTNING was bothered at the start by SPEEDY
FIRE, raced in the second flight for three-eighths of a mile, and rallied mildly between horses through the furlong grounds to earn a share. QUEEN
CALYPSO hustled up to chase after the pacesetter between horses, and lacked the needed bid. SPEEDY FIRE came in at the start, raced three wide and
faded approaching the stretch. SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER saved ground in range for three furlongs, and gave way past the eighth-pole. SHEZA HAPPY
GIRL raced in the second flight toward the inside, and failed to make an impact. I'M A COCO PEBBLES was always outrun. SILVER PACKAGE checked
sharply along the rail at the top of the stretch, and dropped back. WE BLESS LUCK broke slowly and was outrun. REALLYGOODTIMES broke slowly, was
urged early and had no response. BROADWAY DIVA dropped far back approaching the stretch. Timer malfunction, race hand timed, internal fractions
unavailable.

Footnotes
DREAM D'ORO bumped and brushed with SIESTA MOON at the start, raced four then three wide around the turn within striking range, rallied steadily
outside and overhauled the battling leaders in deep stretch. CAPTAIN DUKE received a solid bump from TIO WIL at the start, slipped through on the rail to
join the leaders five-sixteenths out, dueled inside TIO WIL through the lane and ran on gamely. TIO WIL stumbled badly at the start and recovered inward
bumping CAPTAIN DUKE, vied outside U S S COLTON early, dueled outside CAPTAIN DUKE from late on the turn to deep stretch, and yielded in the
closing yards. HANDSOME PRINCE broke in bumping SIESTA MOON into DREAM D'ORO, was outsprinted early, and finished with good energy. SIESTA
MOON brushed and bumped with DREAM D'ORO after being knocked into that rival by HANDSOME PRINCE at the start, and went evenly. U S S COLTON
set the early pace in the two-path, was overtaken from both sides late on the turn, and retreated. SON OF GREATNESS was outrun inside.

Footnotes
BACH raced close up early between horses, lodged a bid outside HANGAR ONE a quarter-mile out, took over into the stretch and pulled clear, and was all
out to hang on inside rivals. TORETTO broke slowly, was outrun to the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and finished strongly outside. CHAO broke
slowly, began improving position after six furlongs, and finished gamely between the top two. FORMAL TREASURE was outrun to the stretch, moved off the
rail with a furlong remaining and found his best stride belatedly. HANGAR ONE took over outside IMPEACH HIM heading to the far turn, moved inside
getting clear, yielded to BACH into the stretch, and faded. NINJA stayed in range toward the inside to the stretch, and faded. LORD FLINTSHIRE broke
slowly, went five wide moving up mildly after six furlongs, but had nothing more. LORD DARNLEY was pinched back between horses approaching the first
turn, moved out five wide with an early bid, and gave way into the stretch. MISSION BRIEF was pushed out into the first turn outside HANGAR ONE, raced
four wide and tired after six furlongs. EL ROMANTICO was forced out in the five-path outside rivals early on the first turn, and was through before reaching
the stretch. CUATE was finished early. IMPEACH HIM set the pace inside for a half-mile, and stopped once displaced for command by HANGAR ONE into
the second turn.

Footnotes
JESSICA broke in brushing BROADWAY CAT, pressed the pace outside ADONAI BLESS and VICTORY CRUSADE, took over in upper stretch and drew
clear. TIME TO TWO STEP hesitated at the start and was off last, moved up inside early, shifted out four wide midway on the turn, stayed on task through
the drive and was up outside for the place. VICTORY CRUSADE contested the pace between horses to the stretch, and weakened through the late stages.
CHUTZPAH broke outward and stumbled a stride from the gate, raced in the four-path and had no rally. ADONAI BLESS dueled inside rivals to the top of
the stretch, and gave way. BROADWAY CAT was brushed by JESSICA at the start, and tired near the three-path after a half-mile. FOREVER MARTA
moved off the inside to the four-path around the turn, and lacked a response. This race was hand timed.

and
saved
the
place.

then
steadied
back
between

one
and
YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY, saved ground to the far turn, moved to the four-path in the drive and finished well outside. JUST THE FACTS set the pace
inside, stayed on past the eighth-pole, and weakened late. BATTLE OF BLENHEIM was bumped between FREEDOM MATTERS and PONT DU GARD and
knocked back at the start, lagged at the rear saving ground for six furlongs, cut the corner beginning to improve coming off the far turn, and finished with
some interest. FREEDOM MATTERS bumped with BATTLE OF BLENHEIM at the start, tracked outside the leaders three wide for six furlongs, and faded.
TWENTY FOUR SEVEN settled off the top trio early, and gave way turning for home. TOTONO raced in the two-path on the turns, and made no impact.
UNCLE CURLY broke in brushing YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY at the start, raced three to four wide, and failed to menace. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY
brushed with UNCLE CURLY at the start, raced three wide and tired after a half-mile.

DOC AMSTER set the pace inside, shook off WESLEY OWEN after a half-mile, widened under urging through upper stretch, and was kept busy to near the
sixteenth-pole before finishing in hand. MAGICAL CAUSE was outsprinted early in the two-path, moved out in the stretch and went clear for the place
outside. WESLEY OWEN pressed DOC AMSTER from outside, could not match strides after a half, and faded on his left lead. CHILL HAZE eyed the
leaders toward the inside for a half, and tired on his left lead. BLOKE broke behind the field, and was outrun inside. MOON MAN WALKING faded in the
four-path on the turn, and was eased up in the lane. IMMERSION showed brief speed three wide, dropped far back on the turn, and was eased up in the
stretch.

Footnotes
HOPONTHEBUSGUS saved ground in striking range early, had the two-path entering the far turn, went back to the rail rallying into the stretch, reached the
front late and prevailed narrowly. FEATURE CREATURE steadied between SPICY NELLY and LADY NINA at the start, waited in traffic on the far turn,
came clear in the four-path through upper stretch, lugged in rallying under heavy pressure late, and just missed. LADY NINA was keyed up early in the
three-path, reached the front outside SUNSET EMPIRE after six furlongs, stayed on to deep stretch and was overhauled from both sides. COLONELS
DAUGHTER moved up around the far turn four then three wide, had aim outside the leaders in upper stretch, and was outfinished. AVENIDA MANANA was
forwardly placed inside to the far turn, got shuffled back badly behind a tiring SUNSET EMPIRE approaching the quarter-pole, moved around that rival into
the lane, and offered a mild response. YAKO raced three wide in contention to the stretch, and took up lacking room behind the leaders a sixteenth out.
SWEET STORY raced in the second flight, and failed to become a factor. FANTASTIC KINGDOM took the far turn in the four-path, and posed no threat.
NIGHT WATCH raced two wide on the turns, and tired. SPICY NELLY saved ground early at the back, moved out three wide to the far turn, and remained
outrun. HANNAH CATHERINE bumped with SUNSET EMPIRE at the start, and was outrun. SUNSET EMPIRE bumped with HANNAH CATHERINE at the
start, was keyed up tugging along up front early, and faltered after six furlongs.

LITTLE NESSO was outrun for a half-mile, moved out to the three-path coming off the turn, lugged in rallying through deep stretch and got up on the rail.
ROYAL HABIBI advanced four wide around the turn, collared ROCK WITH ROBIN from outside late, and just missed. ROCK WITH ROBIN sprinted clear
early inside, began to labor while drifting out past the furlong marker, and was overhauled from both sides. DANCING CRANE chased three wide into the
turn, and weakened through the lane. DARLA showed early speed two wide, and dropped back on the turn. HIDDEN DREAMS was urged along to keep up
early, and tired approaching the stretch. DIAL A LADY raced three to four wide, and was through early.

Footnotes
KING OF ROCK sped to the front and moved inside after an alert beginning, shook off R NINJA J K around the turn, and widened through the stretch under
pressure. VALID EXCHANGE stumbled at the start, hugged the rail around the turn and into the stretch, and was up for the place. R NINJA J K chased
outside KING OF ROCK to the stretch, lost second late, and salvaged the show between horses. GRAND UNION pursued the leaders three wide to the
stretch, and lacked a rally. COLD WARRIOR saved ground and failed to become a factor. PRIVATE ASTRAY tired around the turn three wide.
INACEPTABLE faded around the turn two wide. OPTIMISTIC was always outrun. BORGOBYTHESEA was far back throughout. SULTANNES CROWN
raced far back inside. FERGUS BOGEL broke out, dropped far back after three furlongs, and was eased up in the stretch. Timer malfunction, internal
fractions are unavailable. Final time is hand timed.
