Footnotes
TAP'S LULLABY rated on the front end between rivals, edged ahead from just off the rail when let out leaving the turn, responded to mild urging upper
stretch then surged away the last eighth with no asking. AFFIRMANCE shared the lead just outside TAP'S LULLABY, was no match for that one through the
lane but proved much the best of the rest. ZIP ATTACK BABY displayed brief speed from inside, did not keep up nearing the end of the first quarter mile
and could only improved position into the stretch. MIA MONEY was away slowly, moved up quickly to vie for the lead from outside on the backstretch but
faded with three furlongs to go. SUNDAY ATTACK was also away slowly and showed little.

Footnotes
TRUE TEN shared the early lead from inside, moved ahead when roused on the bend then maintained control under a drive through the lane.
MEADOWLEE'S AFLEET advanced in tight quarters on the backstretch, was checked in close quarters between rivals into the bend, advanced two wide
shortly after that, moved clear for second upper stretch, could not close the gap on the leader the last eighth but was unchallenged for the place. AMAROQ
settled well back, picked up his pace along the rail after a quarter mile, swung out widest for the stretch run and passed weakening rivals to catch DAYJUR
BEST for third. DAYJUR BEST disputed the pace between horses on the backstretch, stayed in path three on the bend, fanned out further into the lane and
began to gradually wear down. DR. LIECHTY was steadied when he was outrun trying to advance in a narrow opening into the turn, was two then three
wide taking the turn, progressed between horses upper stretch then leveled off. GENTLEMAN RICHIE made a small leap from the gate, advanced from
outside to press the pacesetters, did not keep up three wide on the turn and continued to yield in the stretch. ROLL CALL displayed early speed between
horses but gave way and moved to the inside on the bend.

Footnotes
MARCO'S DREAM bobbled outward at the break, brushing LEE LA DEW, vied for the lead from between horses, gained the rail on the turn, was roused
upper stretch and held sway under a drive the final furlong. BEE ATTACK pressed from inside, angled out three wide upper stretch, rallied belatedly but
caught LOOKIN' AT MIKE for second. LOOKIN' AT MIKE disputed the pace outside MARCO'S DREAM from the early going, lacked the extra needed for
the drive but was unchallenged for third. LEE LA DEW crowded briefly at the break, saved ground taking the bend, angled out between rivals for the stretch
run and improved position without threatening. HONEYDOLIST chased from midpack was four wide on the turn and failed to have a stretch rally.
MONFORD bumped and forced inward at the break, helped prompt the pace just outside BEE ATTACK then faded two wide on the bend. BOB'S BRASS
DANCER bore inward at the start, bumping solidly with MONFORD, was steadied, saved ground on the turn, angled out with a sixteenth to go and improved
his position. HARD WHISKEY stayed off the rail and failed to menace. DONNER PASS was a factor from outside on the backstretch but gave way three
wide into the turn.

Footnotes
JUSTENUFFTUFF advanced to share the lead outside CHERNYAHOVSKIY on the backstretch, moved clear on the second bend, was roused leaving that
turn and held on under urging in the lane. TALES OF WAR settled in midpack, was in path three on the second turn, swung out further for the stretch run,
took over second inside the last furlong but could not catch JUSTENUFFTUFF. BEHIND ENEMY LINES unhurried the first half mile, commenced his bid
from inside into the second turn, came into contention along the rail upper stretch, angled out with a sixteenth left, could only make up minor ground but was
clearly best of the others. CHERNYAHOVSKIY displayed early speed from inside, retreated some on the second turn, floated out some midway on that
bend, was checked behind JUSTENUFFTUFF, came off the rail nearing th quarter pole, fanned outside the latter entering the lane and continued to fade.
HELLOFAGUY drifted out going to the first bend, stayed widest the rest of the way and was never a factor. The rider of CHERNYAHOVSKIY lodged an
objection alleging interference from JUSTENUFFTUFF midway on the turn. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that foul claim.

Footnotes
TEMRIK soon took a clear lead and the inside, was challenged approaching the half mile marker, all out in the stretch and got the nod at the wire.
WILDWOOD DREAMER exchanged bumps with BEZEL SET at the break, quickly recovered to vie for the lead outside TEMRIK midway on the backstretch,
battled gamely through the lane but had to settle for second. DIAMOND GUCCI bumped with PRINCESS MANDII leaving the chute, advanced from outside
to race in the second flight, moved clear for third three wide on the turn and found best stride too late deep stretch. PRINCESS MANDII bumped with
DIAMOND GUCCI leaving the chute, chased from outside, progressed four wide on the bend, lost further ground floating out entering the stretch, closed
well but was also too late. UNEEKY chased from midpack, was two wide through the turn, could only make up minor ground deep stretch but was clearly
best of the rest. B REWARDING was an early factor but faded three wide on the bend. THE MORE I BURN chased from inside, angled out on the turn,
came into the lane from path four and failed to have a significant response. BEZEL SET exchanged bumps with WILDWOOD DREAMER at the start, was
well placed inside on the backstretch but began to steadily yield with three furlongs left. BOWS N LACE failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. WICKED
SOPRANO steadily faded on the backstretch, stayed wide through the turn and prove unresponsive in the stretch.

Footnotes
YOU'RE KILLIN ME pressed from outside, went for the lead from path four on the bend, angled in beside GONEGHOST with two furlongs to go, edged
ahead upper stretch then drew clear under a drive the last furlong. SUNNY'S STORM in contention early, angled out nearing the turn, advanced outside
YOU'RE KILLIN ME, could only make minor ground deep stretch but caught GONEGHOST for second. GONEGHOST set a pressured pace from inside,
floated off the rail some into the bend, was challenged from outside, took the rail again entering the lane and slowly yielded. WESTWOOD PROUD pressed
GONEGHOST from just outside, was squeezed and checked nearing the quarter pole, altered out some then ran evenly the final eighth. LITTLE MIGHTY
MAN trailed from outside, closed the gap some two wide on the bend, fanned out entering the stretch and failed to have a significant response. D' YANK
saved ground and was not a factor. The rider of WESTWOOD PROUD lodged an objection alleging interference from YOU'RE KILLIN ME nearing the
quarter pole. After their review, the stewards did not up hold that claim of foul.

ARCH FLYER bumped with EADS BRIDGE at the start, vied for the lead from outside, edged ahead from between rivals on the turn to be two wide into he
lane then gradually opened up under a drive. EADS BRIDGE bumped with ARCH FLYER at the break, moved clear but was soon challenged from outside,
did not keep up along the rail on the turn, regained second into the stretch, slowly yielded but lasted for the place. MISS LEARJET was crowded shortly after
the start and bumped with INDICATING, progressed from outside to vie for the lead on the turn, did not stay with ARCH FLYER in the stretch and ran evenly
the final furlong. LION LOVE prominent from inside, swung out three wide for the stretch run and failed to rally. INDICATING bumped shortly after the break,
lost considerable ground widest on the turn, fanned to the middle of the track for the drive and improved her position without threatening. AIR ELLIE chased
from between rivals and failed to menace. SHES GOT ME GOING in contention early, was three wide on the bend, angled out to path six upper stretch and
had no late bid. SHRIMP showed little in a ground-saving trip. MACBU displayed early speed just off the inside, did not keep up nearing the end of a half
mile, angled out five wide upper stretch, proved unresponsive to urging, was eased in the waning yards and walked off.
