bumped at the outset and settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail through the turn, angled out upper str,etch and chased. NANTUCKET RED, of a
step slowly, moved up quickly and gained a short lead, set a pressured pace, extended her lead a bit, was engaged late turn, dueled, was passed mid
stretch and gave way. A BROKEN BREEZE settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then rallied mildly. ROSEBUD'S HOPE broke
outward and bumped WESTERN CURL, showed a brief turn of speed then forced the issue, rebid late turn, gave way upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
NERO DAVOLA sprinted clear from the break, set the pace, came through the turn along the rail and two-wide, drew away a bit in the stretch, was under a
steady drive then stretched out with a long jump to clear a shadow near the wire. SILENT SISTER raced in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide late
turn, launched an all out rally and was just up for place. FOR MY ELBI broke inward, stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail through the turn, moved off
the fence a furlong out and finished determinedly. ROSA'S SOUL broke outward and bumped MATTHAUS, moved up to press the pace, stalked on the turn,
was set down upper stretch and chased to the end. MATTHAUS, bumped at the start, stalked the pace, was hustled two to four-wide late turn, was game
but weakened in the final yards. LIVIN ON LUV, away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn but failed to menace. SOX AND
SANDALS lost her path at the start, settled off the pace, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide late turn but had no closing response.

Footnotes
MASTER SPY dueled on the backstretch and through the turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch and held sway under a hand ride. MT LOGAN stalked
the pace from the rail, and was all out through the stretch. BODE'S TIPSY was taken back to the rear at the start, saved ground on the turn, bumped
repeatedly with READY HERO while lugging in through the stretch but was game to the end. RUNNINFORCOVER dueled, bumped CORRELATE upper
stretch, chased, but evened out late. READY HERO stalked the pace, chased from the top of the stretch, bumped repeatedly then chased in vain.
CORRELATE broke sharply but outward, pressed the pace, came three-wide through the turn, was bumped upper stretch then flattened out. FLEX was
rated in mid pack, closed three and four-wide on the turn then lacked a response in the stretch.

CAPABLE was rated in mid pack, closed into the far turn, stalked to the stretch then rallied and was up late under a hand ride. SKY DRAGON stalked the
pace, forced the issue on the backstretch, dueled on the turn, drove clear a furlong out but was caught in deep stretch. PIPESTONE set the pace, was
pressured on the backstretch and engaged early on the far turn, dueled, was headed a furlong out and chased to the end. DELIGHTFUL DREAMER settled
off the pace, was hustled from the rail late turn then finished gamely but never reached contention. LEAN ON E stalked early, chased from mid pack on the
far turn then finished gamely. ALL EYES ON ME settled in mid pack, chased three then two-wide on the turn, appeared green coming in and out through the
stretch and evened out with a 16th to run. PLAY IT SMART raced in mid pack, chased three-wide on the far turn but evened out in the stretch. CALL HER
JOEY settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response. ALITTLEIRISHLUCK got away slowly and settled off the
pace, saved ground throughout but lacked a rally.

BOURBON EXTENSION drove out inside four other rivals for the early lead, held his rail position as two made the front and dueled all the way, got a seam
between those two pacesetters as the field turned for home, drove past at the eighth pole and held a safe margin to the wire. LAPOCHKA fell off the pace,
circled the field three to six wide on the far turn, was in the seven path as they came into the stretch, brushed a rival while lugging in upper stretch and
closed wide, no match for the ground saving winner but a clear second best. NIGHT WATCHMAN sat in mid pack along the inside, came off the rail to the
three path awaiting room behind a wall of runners late on the far turn, found a seam by the eighth pole and closed willingly when clear for the show spot.
DEEP FREEZE worked hard to get the front inside an early mad scramble for the lead, dueled with a pace buddy and put that one away turning for home
but was headed by the winner at the eighth pole, tiring to hang on to a minor award. RED BO was pinballed at the start, dropping back to trail until mounting
a rail to three wide run on the far turn and tipping out to the six path in upper stretch, running by rivals while wide, flattening out a bit in the final seventy
yards. KID'S MISCHIEF was between rivals and chasing outside the eventual winner, had no clear path when in behind runners late on the far turn, but
could only close mildly along the inside when room developed in mid stretch. BLACK SEA (FR) settled in mid pack, came two to five wide in touch with the
leaders at the top of the stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. SHEER FLATTERY stalked and dueled with the leader throughout, losing ground down
the stretch. COLTON'S CORNER was three wide stalking the leaders outside two rivals, advanced to make it three in a line turning for home but was on his
wrong lead down the stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
ELEKTRONIC had early speed but was headed, forced the pace from the rail, challenged mid turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch, maintained his
advantage despite lugging in and held sway under a left-handed drive. TRICKY MAGICIAN forced the pace, came three-wide through the turn, lost a little
ground at the top of the stretch and finished under a determined drive. SILVER SHERIFF settled off the pace, closed along the rail through the turn then
chased gamely through the stretch. TRUE DAT, in range, came two-wide through the turn and finished all out between foes. BALA FALLS stalked the pace,
was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then finished gamely. ROBUSTO, in range, was hustled four-wide late turn, chased into the stretch and
launched a strong drive. DANCING DOLL had early speed, was headed, stalked from the rail, encountered traffic in the final furlong and evened out.
CONQUISTADOR closed up to take the lead early turn, set a pressured pace, was joined mid turn, dueled, was headed at the top of the stretch, chased to
the final furlong and gave way. IN A TWIST was in range early, chased three-wide from mid pack on the turn, ran into traffic mid stretch and evened out.

Footnotes
SHEDAT came up inside the leader to stick her head in front into the turn, allowed her pace rival and stalkers to stick around until turning for home when
she sprinted clear in upper stretch, holding safe down to the wire. JLOHR JAN chased the frontrunners, split them late on the turn to take on the eventual
winner but couldn't match that one's energy down to the wire, looking dangerous at times but clearly second best. FREEDOM MACHINE along the rail in
mid pack, came up behind the leaders as the field turned for home but was not up to the top pair, settling for a clear third place finish. SHE'S GOT MOVES
off the pace early, moved up three wide between rivals on the turn into range of the leaders and stayed in contention until mid stretch, levelling off from there
to the wire. ELEANOR POWELL was five wide and chasing, stayed in that five path when roused to loom up late on the turn and still in the six path turning
for home, bumping with a rival and levelling off in the final three sixteenths. FRAME THIS off the pace and over to the rail quickly after the break, rallied into
range of the pack late on the turn in the three path, only able to pass a few stragglers down to the wire. AMBITIOUS PRINCESS led quickly before the
winner came up to her inside for the front into the turn, stayed on until nearing the top of the stretch and faded down the lane. HOITY TOITY was four wide
chasing early and into the turn but dropped backed suddenly from between runners midway around the bend, no run from that point. SAMANTHA'S JOY
hopped up soon after the start, trailed throughout, was pulled up in the stretch and vanned off.

speed, shook clear mid backstretch, set the pace, was under a drive through the stretch but failed to contain the winner late. SILENT CAUSEWAY stalked
the pace, chased two-wide on the turn, launched a determined drive but evened out in the late stages. LA CHAUFFEUR stalked the pace, was hustled from
the rail and two-wide on the turn and was all out through the stretch. LEA RO, rated off the pace, chased from the rail on the turn then closed with some
interest in the stretch. ANITA GRIGIO settled in mid pack, was hustled hard angling from two to four-wide on the turn then finished gamely to no avail.

the pace, closed three-wide late turn but never reached contention. NO EXTENSIONS settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn but was also

Footnotes
RON'S GIZMO dueled early, led three-wide at the top of the stretch, came in upper stretch, shook clear and held under a drive. POUND GREEN stalked the
pace, closed on the turn, drew even with RON'S GIZMO upper stretch but was herded inward towards the rail, came out in the final furlong and rallied
gamely. FIFTH SEASON settled off the pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, moved out further in the stretch then rallied late outside.
STRIKE A BEAT settled off the pace, closed four then three-wide on the turn, rallied, lost his path in the final furlong then chased to the end. IRVING raced
in mid pack, closed four and five-wide on the turn, was lugging in through the stretch but was still game to the end. OWEN'S SOUPER MOON dueled early,
stalked three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out late. FINAL ECLIPSE raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn
