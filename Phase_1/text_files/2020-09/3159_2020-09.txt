Footnotes
REGAL MAX sat in striking position while three wide, angled out into the lane, closed steadily outside and won driving. ZIPPITY ZAP rated a slim lead inside
and was met entering the backstretch by BAR NO Q, dueled at even terms into the final turn, contested the lead on the rail nearing the stretch then rider lost
whip and inched away from rival under a strong hand ride for place. BAR NO Q pushed to the front to contest the early pace, hounded ZIPPITY ZAP
through the far turn, dueled into the stretch under heavy urging and gave way grudgingly in the final yards. SIR BRONX rated off the pace along the rail,
dropped back into the far turn and offered a mild bid into the stretch. TIGER BY HIS TAIL tracked outside and rallied mildly late. CHASKA stalked outside
and lacked a closing response. TAP MASTER sat mid pack and lacked a serious bid.

of the pack, then raced in close quarters at the three sixteenth and rallied gradually outside to earn show. MYSTERIOUS PROMISE sat just off the pace
inside, gained an advantage at the three eighths marker, was jostled in the turn, was overtaken at the head of the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

and lacked the rally needed in the drive. REDNECK REMARK vied between rivals leaving the backstretch then jostled through the turn, rallied into the

CARRAMIAMINE sat in striking position while three wide, drove two wide at the head of the stretch gaining the lead and won driving. ASTARTOBE raced
four to five wide leaving the backstretch, gained outside then responded to encouragement at the quarter pole, rallied determinedly outside and got up for
place. TROOPER JENNY contested the pace from the three path, was overtaken then was bested late. DOLLY DAGGER raced at the back of the pack and
raced evenly through the lane under steady urging. BONNIE TRADER settled off the pacesetters and showed a mild interest late. HEY HEY RUN AWAY
sent for speed inside and was done early. PHINALYWYN failed to menace. SCREAMIN SUE went five wide leaving the backstretch and offered little.
POP'S LITTLE GIRL sent for speed outside and faded steadily leaving the turn.

Footnotes
EDGE OF OKOTOKS broke alertly, vied for the early lead, prompted outside of REDS LITTLE STAR leaving the backstretch, rallied four wide into the
stretch, closed gamely outside and won the nod. BLUSHING BROOKE well rated inside, gained quickly along the rail nearing the quarter pole, found
running room into the stretch and was nipped before the wire. MISS MCFAD raced in second flight from the four path, swung out five wide into the lane and
was out kicked. NU LEGACY saved ground, lodged a rail bid at the quarter pole and improved in the drive. GO MAMA bid belatedly stretch. SESAME rated
just off the pace from the four path, roused inside at the quarter pole and lacked a closing response. ROYAL STATUS rated off the pace outside, circled the
field into the lane and came up empty for the drive. MISS HESI never reached contention. REDS LITTLE STAR dueled for the early lead from just off the rail
then wilted abruptly into the stretch. TALA sat in striking distance outside and retired early.

Footnotes
SANGRIA rated just off the early pace while four wide, moved up alongside PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE around the half then took over the lead at the three
eighths marker, responded gamely to challenge from FLAT AS A PANCAKE and was kept under strong handling under steady pressure through the drive.
FLAT AS A PANCAKE prompted the pace while three wide, took back leaving the backstretch between rivals, asked to quicken at the quarter pole then
moved up menacingly but was unable to reach the winner. IRISH LUNA settled just off the pacesetters inside, chased then shifted out at the eighth pole
brushing KENTUCKY ROLL and finished gamely. KENTUCKY ROLL lacked running room inside entering the opening turn, trailed the field through the
backstretch, was brushed at the head of the stretch and yielded. PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE rated a slim lead, took pressure through the backstretch, was
overtaken at the three eighths and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. LIL OL FLATTER tracked outside, pressed the issue while three wide leaving the
backstretch and tired early. JOCKEY and TRAINER OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of KENTUCKY ROLL against the rider of IRISH LUNA
alleging interference mid stretch. After review of the Stewards IRISH LUNA was disqualified for interference to KENTUCKY ROLL and placed fourth.

Footnotes
NORTHERN JAGER contested the pace while in the four path, fanned three wide into the far turn, rallied three wide at the head of the stretch then battled
inside of POCKET DIAL and prevailed under a long hard drive. POCKET DIAL rated off the pace, swung out four to five wide entering the lane, rallied
determinedly outside of NORTHERN JAGER and was out finished. BIG ROCKET MAN stalked the pacesetters inside, lacked running room nearing the
eighth, angled in but lacked the kick that was needed and held. CHAIRMAN FIFTYFIVE lagged early, gained closer order approaching the stretch and
rallied mildly. OSO BRAVE gained closer order into the final turn and rallied belatedly. LOOKIN FOR MADDIE chased throughout. FINALLY FAMOUS
trailed the field and passed tiring rivals. SHADY BIZ sat in striking position while three wide then prompted action nearing the three eighths and had nothing
left in reserve for the drive. PADDYSDAYCHARM vied from the two path, took pressure leaving the backstretch, responded to challengers in the final turn
and gave way inside. SCRUFFIAN raced wide into the backstretch then settled in range and was done early.

Footnotes
SUNBURST settled in stride, saved ground from the four path through the backstretch, advanced willingly into the far turn, was driven up three wide into the
lane, continued to gain on the outside into the stretch and pulled clear. SAVEITFORARAINYDAY raced towards the back, gained inside quickly entering the
final turn, raced in traffic around the quarter pole, angled out to the four path and closed determinedly but was unable to reach the winner. HIDDEN GRACE
vied three wide into the opening turn, overtook the leader into the backstretch under a snug hold then drew clear, came under urging into the lane in
response to challenge from SUNBURST and flattened late. RAIDER reserved off the dueling pacesetters, took closer order outside then moved up
alongside HIDDEN GRACE and lacked the rally needed. PIPER ROSE trailed the field early, circled into the lane and closed well late. SPECIAL BRANDY
saved ground inside, came four wide into the lane and finished evenly. MORE MO FOR ME reserved off the leaders, took closer order leaving the
backstretch and had no response when asked. PORT PROTECTION saved from the two path, lacked a clear path at the quarter pole and failed to menace.
PENNY A POINT lacked a bid. BLUES ROAR raced mid pack and gave way into the lane. CYPRESS POINT set a pressured pace, shifted out to the three
path leaving the backstretch and tired.

Footnotes
TROOPER JOHN raced in second flight in the five path, began a bid outside around the three eighths, rallied four wide at the head of the stretch then
gained an advantage in the final sixteenths and held under steady pressure. GO AWAY saved ground while three wide, was asked to quicken nearing the
three eighths, found running along the rail into the lane, responded to urging in close quarters and was unable to stall the winner. SHIMSHINE trailed the
field, uncoiled a rail bid into the stretch then angled out brushing WHISKEY BOUND and held for show. WHISKEY BOUND clipped heels leaving the gate,
raced at the back of the pack, circled the field into the lane, closed well outside then was brushed and missed. DEUCES ARE WILD showed the way
through the backstretch, took pressure inside of SHARP DRESSED BEAU, shuffled back between rivals into the stretch and yielded. GOLD BUYER lagged
early, roused at the quarter pole and improved under heavy urging. SHARP DRESSED BEAU pressed the pace from the two path, moved up to challenge
the lead and yielded. INTENT TO STRIKE fanned four wide into the opening turn, prompted three wide and faded gradually. STORMCHASER raced five
wide into the backstretch, tracked four wide then ranged up into the final turn while three wide and stopped. DRILLER angled inward early, tracked inside,
chased leaving the backstretch and had nothing left in reserve. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race but
made no change to the order of finish.

Footnotes
REAL GRACE set the pace while saving ground, was asked to quicken the far turn, responded to challenge from SYNERGY and held off a late closer under
a drive to save the win. SOMETHING NATURAL sat mid pack in the two path, shifted outside through the backstretch, chased inside into the final turn,
responded to heavy urging and closed determinedly outside and missed. RAIL HUGGER allowed to settle early, advanced inside leaving the backstretch
then was put to a drive, gained ground inside through the stretch and was outkicked. SYNERGY sat in striking position while three wide leaving the opening
turn, angled inward leaving the backstretch, moved up menacingly nearing the quarter pole outside of REAL GRACE, kept on under steady encouragement
and weakened in the final yards. AT ATTENTION under a snug hold racing in front of the grandstand, prompted the pace from the two path, steadied
around the three sixteenths pole and was unable to improve position through the drive. BIG AL'S VISION raced near the back while saving ground, swung
wide into the lane under coaxing and closed steadily through the lane. MONGOLIAN WIND tracked outside then went six wide into the backstretch, moved
up closer to the pace while three wide and lacked a closing response. MR. UNUSUAL saved ground inside early, dropped back and passed tiring.
GAMBLER lacked a serious bid. BARE BACK JACK stalked two wide early, lost ground entering the backstretch, sat just off the pace while four wide and
retired early.

Footnotes
TRANSPLANT dueled for the early lead inside of LOOKIECOOKIE, responded to threat from VENDING MACHING in the far turn, was given his cue nearing
the three sixteenth and drove clear. VENDING MACHINE sent for inside speed, prompted from the rail, was unable to sustain the bid that was needed and
held finishing in a dead heat for place. MARK YE WELL raced at the back of the pack while six wide, took closer racing four to five into the lane, rallied
gradually outside and finished on the wire for place outside of VENDING MACHINE. SYNNIN tracked four wide in the opening stages, bid near the five
sixteenth pole, drove four wide into the stretch and flattened out. OJO DEL MAR broke outward leaving, lodged a mild bid into the stretch and lacked room
late. LONG TIME DON hustled away, sat off the pace in the two path, chased hard on the final turn and faded. AWESOME ANTHONY saved ground early
while three wide, trailed into the stretch and passed tiring. WEST OF SABINAL dwelt before leaving the gate, gained outside into the final turn and failed to
menace. LOOKIECOOKIE dueled for the early lead, dropped back and flattened. MADE FOR SATURDAY chased outside early, angled towards the rail
then took closer order, lacked running room inside and yielded.

Footnotes
ADRIEN'S AURORA sat just off the pace inside, moved up alongside YORKTOWN then saved ground through the far turn, was given cue into the lane and
widened late stretch. TRIPLE LIVE chased the pacesetters, rallied inside entering the stretch but was no match for the winner. SMALL TOWN DUDE never
far back in the three path, rallied gradually inside and edged away. YORKTOWN quickly went to the lead under a snug hold, contended the lead through the
far turn, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and weakened. BLAZING CHANNING settled off the pacesetters while three wide, chased four
wide at the head of the lane and was unable to improve position through the drive. HUERFANO G. offered a late mild bid. TIZTHUNDERINOW settled
outside early and lacked a bid. TUXEDO MASK stumbled leaving and was never involved. SOCRATES showed little. WHERE'S THE REWARD saved to no
avail.
