Footnotes
EMPEROR'S GOLD pressed outside the leader early, had the lead inside nearing the far turn, got passed by a foe mid turn and re-rallied to re-take the lead
by mid stretch and keep safe to the wire. TOP CREDENTIALS showed inside speed early, dropped back to prompt the pace, re-took the lead at the top of
the far turn, was engaged by the winner in the stretch and lost the lead while giving chase to no avail. ENTERTAINER chased to the far turn, ranged up to
threaten there but evened out down the stretch. ST. RONANS raced mid pack, was well placed behind the leaders on the turn but flattened out in upper
stretch. GOTSOMEMOJO was never close. CROWN TO THE GOLD was unhurried, got closer on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
ROLLIN MY OWN bumped a horse at the start, chased a lone leader to the turn, quickened to take command at the quarter pole and drew off. THE BIG
GAMBLER was well back early and closed best from off the pace in the final furlong to take second despite drifting out. BUCKEYE WARRIOR was toward
the back, got closer in upper stretch and ran willingly late. KINETIC ART was bumped between horses at the start, stalked at the rail, got close mid stretch
but needed more late. HEIDI'S SINATRA ran from well back to the stretch, was very wide but improved position. BUCKEYE KITTEN was bumped at the
start, came into the stretch in the five path and evened out. ROAD OF DIAMONDS was bumped between horses at the start, pushed along on the turn and
lost position while evening out. ENTICING SHAQ threw the rider in the post parade, broke sharp to the front, lost the lead in upper stretch and tired late.

CALIFORNIA SUN took a restrained lead early, stayed in front throughout and opened up in the stretch to stay clear. DREAMS OF YVONNE tracked inside
from second, lost position on the turn and rallied up the rail in late stretch to regain the place spot. PENTHOUSE KITTEN raced up close early, backed off a
bit and closed in the final furlong to just get up for show. ECHO ALPHA SIX tracked to the far turn, chased the winner down the stretch and weakened in the
final sixteenth to miss hitting the board. HEY RAY, well off the pace, improved position late. TOMAHAWK KITTEN improved position late. KALYDAR was up
close, took the four path in the first turn and weakened in the stretch. E Z'S WIDE OPEN was off the pace to the stretch and faltered. LUCKYINKENTUCKY
was never close and very wide in the stretch. SNORING BARTH was way back and very wide into the stretch. PRESSONREGARDLESS was mid pack to
the stretch and faltered. RUSSIAN TO TAPIT was mid pack, lacked room entering the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
BRINK POINT bumped a horse at the start, tracked behind a compact field, rallied from the rail on the far turn, led clear in upper stretch and had the space
to stay safe from a late closer. KARAMEL CORN raced outside three foes vying for the lead early, dropped back to last, ranged up on the turn and entered
the stretch in the six path, closed fast late to cut the margin on the winner but was too late. MACADOOOO KID showed speed on the inside, lost position on
the turn but came back to take third late. ONE CRAZY RIDE vied early, led on the turn, was no match for the winner and lost the place spot and more deep.
TRUST AND OBEY pressed between horses early, exchanged bumps near the turn and ran evenly late. DIAL MR PROSPECTOR bumped a horse at the
start, exchanged bumps nearing the turn and quit while on the turn.

MY MAE DAY started to roll past horses on the backstretch, led at the three eighths pole and was clear down the stretch. JAZZ MUSIC showed early speed,
took a bad step nearing the turn, quickly regrouped, was no match for the winner but ran on for place. EXCLUSIVE DONALD pulled to race behind the
leader early, came up the rail in the stretch to challenge for second but needed more. CAPE MARCO DRIVE was off the pace and showed a late rally in the
stretch to improve position. WALLET raced up close to the turn, took the five path and faded in the stretch. NUMBERS NEVER LIE chased from mid pack
and showed little in the stretch. FAIRWAY LANE was involved for a quarter and faltered. LUCKY LOOKIN faltered after a quarter.

Footnotes
LIL HITCHHIKER good position to the far turn, rallied into the stretch and finished in earnest to get the nod with a good effort. MAYAPRETTY no speed to
the half, split horses past the five sixteenth pole, came wide with a late charge too late with a good effort while coming on too late. SPEAK ENGLISH speed
to the front, led to deep stretch and and finished willingly for the show spot. MACHINE GUN MERRY slow break while far back to far turn and finished with
good courage in the final stages while running out ground with a good effort. MOMOS HUMOR raced along outside throughout with a mild gain in the drive.
ST. LOUISE never reached contention after checking along with a rough trip on the rail into far turn. GEN Z was through after half. LADY DENISSE always
back while passing weary ones in the stretch run. MISS O' PRADO never a menace. KISS ME PRADO was through at the half and steadily dropped back.
ONE LAST JIG never prominent. ATLANTIS ROSE was through after half and dropped back.

Footnotes
CANDY MOVER led clear before the turn, was on the rail down the stretch and widened under some urging. EL PIQUIN chased, was urged to keep up on
the turn and proved no match and second best. PUDDLE JUMPER was well back to the turn, rallied in the five path there and got by a foe mid stretch to get
the show spot. KISSIN ALEX was up close early, dropped back well off the lead, rallied on the turn to gain third in the stretch but faltered and lost position
late. KANTPAYTHETOLL ducked in at the gap after the start, was far back to the stretch and gained position in the final furlong. GETTING JIGGY veered in
and bumped a horse at the start and was off the pace throughout. KAT BEE BLUE was off slow and never in it. MUCHO SPICY was bumped at the start,
stalked inside and leveled out in the stretch. FURLOUGH FIT broke slow, was way back and no threat.
