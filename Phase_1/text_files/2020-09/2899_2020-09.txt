Footnotes
AT FIRST BLUSH was well rated early and moved off the rail, made a three wide move on the far turn, quickly assumed command entering the stretch,
drew off to prove much the best under a hand ride. TO FAT TO FISH was five wide into the first turn, then was reserved down the backstretch, came into
the stretch while launching a bid four wide but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. QUEENOFMYDBLWIDE was allowed to
settle while three to four wide on the backstretch, moved over closer to the rail on the far turn, but offered no significant rally while getting up for the show
award. REAL BELLA was sent to the lead and drew off on the backstretch while off the rail, then gave way in the stretch. WISHED off a step a slow, chased
pace on the inside before tiring. ITSALLABOUTYOULOU was allowed to settle early and raced in between rivals on the backstretch then tired.
MABEETHISTIME showed little.

PAIGE'S STAR vied for the early lead from the inside, then was rated off the pace on the turn, awaited room and swung out five wide for the drive, closed
determinedly to get up in time, driving. LOVE BROKE THRU was allowed to settle early, made a four wide on the far turn, drew clear past the eighth pole,
but was nailed at the wire to just miss. BOLD CONCEPT chased the early pace three wide, checked around the seven sixteenths pole, then came into the
stretch four wide, angled in in the stretch to finish well. COLONIAL JILL vied for the early lead and made a two wide bid on the far turn, but faded in the
drive. CHARGINGONBY stalked the early pace and made a three wide move on the far turn to vie for the lead, but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
HARD TO BE GOOD was away alertly, set the pace from off the rail while uncontested, then was kept to pressure to prove best. WAGON BOSS chased the
early pace from the inside, angled off the rail in the stretch but could not get to the winner staying on to be second best. MAKE NOISE was allowed to settle
while three wide, came into the stretch while four wide , offered a mild rally. TEZ was reserved early, advanced on the far turn and came into the stretch five
wide but offered no significant rally. AUTOMATE lacked a rally. MINE OWN STAR was reluctant to load into the gate, raced three wide into the first turn,
failed to menace. SINGLE GEM chased the pace three wide then tired. BAHAMA CHANNEL was not a factor.

CLASSY COWBOY was rated early while four wide on the backstretch, made a five wide past the quarter pole, went on even terms leaving the furlong
marker then edged clear late to prove best, driving. ROCKY RUSH was away alertly to set the pace, dawdled along while being well handled, dueled for the
lead past the sixteenth pole but could not hold off the winner while being second best. REDYORNOTHEREICOME was allowed to settle early, made a mild
bid on the inside but flattened out while gaining the show. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER tracked the early pace then made a bid in between rivals but
flattened out. WHEREWEGOIN stalked the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid on the far turn to loom boldly but was empty in the drive.

Footnotes
EAST LEX was allowed to settle early, split horses leaving the quarter pole, then angled out in the stretch to continue rally, then got up late to prove best
under a drive. MISSION CANYON vied for the lead on the inside, made a bid entering the stretch to shake clear leaving the furlong grounds, but could not
hold off the winner late. INDOCUMENTADO was reserved early, advanced on the outside of the winner on the fat turn while three wide, came into the
stretch four wide, offered a mild late rally. ON THE MUSCLE was well placed early, made a bid between rivals past the half mile marker to vie for the lead,
then faded in thee drive. RESPONDER was allowed to settle on the inside but lacked the needed bid in an even effort. BUBBA CABALLO vied for the lead
three wide then tired after six furlongs. HESITATION BLUES chased the pace four wide then weakened. WEEKEND IN COURT failed to menace. ARION
MAGIC (FR) was not a threat while wide. UPSHUR COUNTY was through after a half.
