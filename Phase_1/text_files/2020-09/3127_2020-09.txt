Footnotes
SENORITA ESTRELLA had good speed, dueled between rivals and two wide to the stretch, inched away under pressure to mid stretch then was clear
driving. MIA SOLINA dueled inside the winner to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then stubbornly saved the place. M FAST hustled to join the
leaders after a sixteenth, dueled three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. LOOKIN' SWEET had no speed, raced two wide
to the stretch then could not make an impact late. MY THREE KIDS was outsprinted to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch, loomed briefly in mid
stretch then flattened out. GREY ABBEY tracked the leaders two wide to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. UNUSUAL DANCER had no speed
and was not a factor.

chased the winner throughout, was outkicked to mid stretch then dug in determinedly to catch PURE PERFECTION for the place. PURE PERFECTION The
latter pressed the winner for six furlongs, got outrun in upper stretch then lost the place late. TINK'S TWIRL stalked the winner to the second turn then
saved ground to no avail. LACEY'S RAINBOW was settled for a half mile in mid pack, raced three wide on the second turn but lacked the needed closing
response. NORTHERN ROSE got outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn then also saved ground but did not rally. LESEDI had no speed,
was three wide throughout and not a factor. PACIFIC STRIKE was always outrun. SHARI trailed throughout.

MON CAMO was among the leaders early between rivals but was shuffled back leaving the half, raced two wide on the turn then rallied when set down, split
rivals, took over leaving the furlong grounds and held driving. SOUND JUDGMENT chased the pace to the turn, was asked three wide, pushed up to
engage for the lead leaving mid stretch but was outfinished for the win. SIERRA MELODY attended the pace two wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid
stretch then was also outkicked. COUNTRY ROAD had no speed, got fanned four wide to the stretch and finished in a mild rally. UNBRIDLED'S SKYE also
had no speed, was forced to circle four then five wide to the stretch and lacked the needed late response. MISTER MOJO hustled along to attend the pace
from the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then tired.

Footnotes
FUENTE (GB) checked off heels into the first turn then pressed the leader to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms in mid
stretch then dug in determinedly to prevail. OUR SILVER OAK was unhurried to the backstretch, tried to go inside nearing the half but was blocked behind
RIVER ROSE, took back then saved ground on the second turn, shifted out once in the drive and closed willingly to get the nod for second. RIVER ROSE
pushed to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, was collared by the winner in mid stretch but battled gamely to just miss the place. SHADRACK
was settled mid pack to the backstretch then was rank and hard to place off heels to the half mile pole, raced two wide to the stretch then was also making
up ground belatedly. NOLONGERAHOBBY trailed to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch and picked off rivals in the drive. SARNI pressed the pace
early, stalked to the second turn, got outkicked to the stretch and weakened. SMILEFORME also was tracking the pace, got outrun on the far turn and also
gave way in the drive. SIX POINT RACK had no speed and was never a factor.

not switching leads to prevail. MIDNIGHT SUNRISE stalked the pace to the turn, rallied inside to the stretch, took a short lead leaving mid stretch, could not
stall the winner but dug in to save second. BLACK DROP was crowded by NO COVER CHARGE early and checked, had no speed, raced two wide on the
turn, shifted out in the drive and came on late. MOLLIE O ' MCEVOY was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but was outfinished inside late.
SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE got outrun to the turn, circled four then five wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. PEARL DRAGON set the pace
to the turn, dueled two wide to the stretch then stayed to mid stretch but weakened late. MISS SKI lagged to the turn, was two wide to the stretch then was
steered out widest and came on late. NO COVER CHARGE pressed the pace early, pushed up three wide to get on terms, dueled to almost mid stretch
