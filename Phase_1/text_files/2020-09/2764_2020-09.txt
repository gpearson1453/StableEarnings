Footnotes
OVERLY LUCKY, tracked off the first flight three deep racing to the first turn, made steady progress to gain terms with the leaders in that path nearing the
far turn, bid for command approaching upper stretch while shifting to the four path entering the lane and held sway to the end under firm handling. ALWAYS
COOL was rated between foes in second flight tracking just off the leaders, was shuffled a bit out of close quarters after a half while angling inside, shifted
out three wide nearing upper stretch splitting rivals advancing on the eventual winner, shifted out racing through the lane and continued willingly to close the
gap. RUNTECH tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight, saved ground on the far turn while gaining some position, briefly awaited an
opening nearing upper stretch, then came through along the rail in the closing stages to prevail for a share. CLASSY PAPA, in touch attending a rival's pace
racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes racing into the far turn, gave way into the lane. RICHIE GARY settled off the second flight along
the inside in the opening half, swung outside foes to race four wide on the far turn but had no rally. BLAZIN' ASIAN stumbled badly at the start, was quickly
righted to dictate the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the backstretch, dueled inside foes into the second bend and gave out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
SWEET AS CANBE was urged along the rail prompting the pace from the outset into the turn, forged clear into upper stretch and widened under pressure.
WEE MS. BURNZIE tracked the pace between rivals in second flight racing to the turn, angled in to split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch and
continued with interest to prove best of the others. BABY GORDITA broke readily to prompt the pace outside a rival from the outset into the turn and gave
way entering upper stretch. LUCKY MAC broke slowly, angled to the inside gaining a position in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch regaining
some position but lacked the needed final bid. MS COMEDY TIME tracked off the first flight four wide in the opening stages, shifted in nearing the turn
making a brief, three wide bid but quickly came up empty. WILD DESIRE settled last in early stages and failed to menace thereafter.

MORE THAN A. P. angled to the inside tracking pacesetter from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, switched off the inside after a half
while coming under pressure to advance, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter while switching outside that foe racing into upper stretch, then continued
with a sustained response to take over in the closing stages and go clear under firm handling. SIERRA HOTEL sped clear of the field while angling to the
inside, dictated the pace on a comfortable advantage to upper stretch, came under pressure to resist when challenged midstretch but soon faltered. WHATA
PERFECT DAY settled between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside on the first turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued well enough
to prevail for a share. WANNAPLAYBIGCHIEF settled last to the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing the lane but offered no rally. SILVER MAKER
tracked just outside the leaders racing to the backstretch, made brief progress after a half to advance on the pacesetter but soon emptied out.

Footnotes
SERENGETI CAT, off slowly, was urged to gain a position inside foes tracking just off the pacesetter along the rail racing into the bend, was shuffled back
avoiding a tiring foe nearing upper stretch, was held up while altering course outside that foe entering the lane, then split foes just off the inside to wrest the
advantage in time under firm handling. CORRANA EN LIMEN, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn, continued
with a steady bid to wrest the advantage racing into upper stretch, angled to the rail while briefly gaining a clear margin and just failed to contain the winner.
ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE settled last along the inside, saved ground into the turn, came around a tiring foe nearing upper stretch, then angled back inside
foes to improve position to the end. AZARUK tracked off the second flight in the opening stages, shifted out four wide on the turn while being prompted to
advance, briefly gained striking distance entering the lane but came up empty in the closing stages. TOUCHING RAINBOWS, urged three deep prompting
the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way between foes late. DEE'S LUCK, forwardly placed between rivals tracking just off the leaders early,
faded into the turn. LANGS LEGEND was hustled to the lead along the inside, set the pace into the turn and gave way abruptly nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
I'M AN EIGHT came through close quarters, then angled to the rail gaining a position tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the first turn, continued under
light rating tracking off the first flight while switching off the inside after a half, was prompted to advance three wide into the far turn, moved to challenge for
command in that path nearing upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and held sway to the end under pressure. BROKEN KEY, caught in close quarters
just after the start, was reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, shifted out while advancing in close quarters
racing through the stretch and edged a rival for the place honors on the wire while moving to close the gap. MISS PERFECTA, restless in the post parade,
switched out in the opening stages, was urged to prompt the pace between foes, eased off the leaders nearing the far turn while angling inside and
continued with an even effort to gain some position along the rail. MASKED, urged to a clear advantage while angling to the rail racing into the first turn,
dueled for command inside foes into the far turn to upper stretch and gave way. MR. BENZ settled outside foes in early stages, was fanned four wide into
the lane but offered no rally. GAME DAY DECISION, urged to terms with the first flight three wide prompting the pace racing to the far turn, gave way
nearing the lane.

entering the lane and widened under firm encouragement. J J'S WILDCAT broke sharply, forced the pace outside the eventual winner racing into the turn
but proved no match late. GONE A LIL LU HU tracked off the first flight three deep between foes and continued with an even effort to gain a share racing
into the lane. FIERCE HE BE threw his head at the start breaking awkwardly, was settled outside rivals racing to the turn and continued with interest to gain

Footnotes
TRADIN UP, reserved in the last flight while angling to the inside, steadily gained on the leaders along the rail entering the far turn, shifted out four wide
entering the lane and continued with a steady late response to wrest a narrow advantage in time under firm handling. CHAMPS SUCCESS broke outwards
bumping a rival, was quickly righted while moving to gain a forward placing racing to the first turn, angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders into the
backstretch, switched out after a half while moving to challenge for command between foes, dueled for command inside ROCKTHEPULPIT into upper
stretch, was bumped by that foe, then continued to exchange repeated contact to late stages and just failed to contain the winner while prevailing for
second. ROCKTHEPULPIT, forwardly placed outside a rival attending the pace under light reserve in the opening stages, was fanned three wide entering
the far turn, was urged to challenge for command in that path racing through the second bend, shifted inwards bumping CHAMPS SUCCESS nearing
midstretch, then continued to exchange repeated contact while weakening in the closing stages. SHATTERED DREAMS broke readily to gain a forward
placing, was rated tracking off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, then switched out entering the lane
and gained some position while no threat to the top trio. RISKY SITUATION, urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, pressed
the pace inside rivals racing into the second bend and gave way into the lane. MISCHIEVOUS MO tracked off the first flight a outside rival racing to the
backstretch, was caught four wide racing past the half mile marker and faded into the far turn. TWIRLINCOTTONCANDY, bumped at the start, settled
outside a rival in the last flight, angled four wide racing into the far turn but never gained contention.

Footnotes
CREATIVE PLAN broke outwards bumping CENTRAL PARK, was righted to track off the first flight between rivals from out of striking distance racing to the
backstretch, then steadily drew into striking range splitting foes in the final sixteenth to narrowly prevail on the wire under brisk handling. CENTRAL PARK,
bumped at the start while being forced into GOT EVEN SMARTER, was quickly righted, then urged to the lead outside a rival racing into the first turn,
dictated the pace through the backstretch on a narrow advantage, dueled for command outside a rival through the far turn, edged forward in a grudging
effort racing into upper stretch and drifted out in late stages resisting the winner's challenge and prevailed narrowly for second. GO AWAY hopped at the
start breaking a bit slowly, tracked the leaders along the rail, steadily drew into contention nearing upper stretch, shifted outside a tiring rival to bid between
foes in close quarters in the closing stages but was just outkicked. GOT EVEN SMARTER, bumped at the start, was settled last to the backstretch, saved
ground to the lane and improved position inside foes late. BOBBY BABY shifted out three wide early tracking just off the second flight, continued four wide
into the lane and steadily faded. UNLEASH THE BEAST, urged inside a rival prompting the pace into the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn to
upper stretch and gave way. RACER tracked just off the first flight three wide in the opening half and gave way racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
VEGAN GOES BEST ducked out at the start, was quickly righted to attend a rival's pace racing through the backstretch, took over leaving the midway point
of the bend, angled to the rail and went clear under firm hand urging. JUST SPLENDID settled last racing to the turn, swung out four wide racing into upper
stretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail for the place honors. DEVIL LADY was rated along the rail tracking just off the second flight into
the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and improved position inside rivals late. COCO LOCO MAMA angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight into
the turn, saved ground on the bend, switched off the inside entering the lane but had no closing bid. DISTINCT FLIRT switched outside rivals early, tracked
the leaders three wide through the turn to the lane, then finished in hand while racing in close quarters late. SWEET SASSAFRASSY was hustled to the
lead from the break, set the pace between foes on a narrow margin racing into the turn, gave way leaving the midway point of the turn and drifted out into
the lane.
