urging. GRAZED MY BISCUITS sent hard pressed the pace through the turn being overpowered in upper stretch hanging on late in the two path to salvage

through the turn mustering a mild rally down the lane to improve at mid track. MILTON ROAD slow early played no factor. ASTRO ORBITER led with early
speed being hooked on the turn giving way along the inside in upper stretch. MOUNTAIN EXPRESS chased through the turn then folded in upper stretch.
