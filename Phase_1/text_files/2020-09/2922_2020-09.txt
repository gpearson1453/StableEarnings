Footnotes
DON'T CHARGE IT lunged at the start, trailed inside around the first turn, angled out to advance four wide down the backstretch, continued a four wide run
around the far turn, seized command near the three-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. DAH PHILLY set the early pace inside, settled back inside
down the backstretch, continued to save ground off the pace around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and re-rallied to gain second. DISCO PARTY
was off the pace four wide around the first turn, advanced outside to reach contention down the backstretch, pressed two wide in the three path around the
far turn but was one-paced in the lane. TRAPPE ME LATER pressed the pace two wide, took the lead down the backstretch, set the pace in the two path
from there to upper stretch and weakened. INCLUDE GOLD chased the pace two and three wide and came up empty. OLA GATITA played no factor while
racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
BORSA VENTO tracked the pace two wide between rivals early, raced three wide between around the far turn, rallied between rivals through the lane and
was up in the final strides. PERFETTO set the pace in the two path, was headed by two different rivals around the far turn, regained command in upper
stretch, fought on through the lane and led until the final strides. RELENTLESS LION stalked the pace four wide, took a slim near lead near the
five-sixteenths pole but was outfinished in the lane. SHOTMASTER raced off the pace three and four wide, lacked the needed rally and had the rider lose
the whip in late stretch. CORT'N ASONG pressed the pace three wide between foes, had brief lead past the three-eighths pole but weakened soon after.
TRUE BLUE chased the pace inside and faded.

Footnotes
HAPPINESS steadied while getting out a bit around the first turn, pressed the pace three wide, seized command near the quarter pole, quickly drew clear,
continued on the left lead in the lane, drifted out a bit under left-handed pressure in upper stretch then straightened out and widened under moderate hand
urging. ANOTHER WHIM raced off the pace three wide, lacked room nearing the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch and was along late for the place.
MAGICGIRL settled off the pace three wide, made a mild rally in the lane and was up for the show late. BELLA GIANNA set the pace along the rail, was
collared near the quarter pole and weakened. DYNAMIC MISS chased the pace inside and came up empty. SO WHO'S BACK played no factor while racing
three and four wide. FILLY RIDE chased the pace two wide and retreated.

TRUNK OF MONEY set the pace in the two path, drew off in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. BETTYANN stalked the winner three wide, could
not match strides with that foe through the last three-eighths but stayed on well to be clearly second best. DREAMING DIAMONDS was in range two wide
between, lacked the needed rally but outfinished foes for the show. GRAY HAZE never threatened while racing three wide. VIRGINIA BEACH had early
speed inside and came up empty in the lane. HAD THE NOTION failed to menace while racing two and three wide. GRACETOWN played no factor while
racing four wide. DREAMS OF SHIRLEY was outrun while racing three wide.

HE'S SMOKIN NOW brushed with a rival at the start, advanced four wide around the turn, lugged in under right-handed urging in upper stretch, angled back
out leaving the three-sixteenths pole, rallied under hand urging, lugged in when put to right-handed pressure again leaving the sixteenth pole, straightened
back out, closed determinedly under a solid hand ride and was up in the final strides. CHARGE TO VICTORY stalked the pace three wide, took the lead in
midstretch and led until the final strides. TAKE YOUR PLACE raced well back in the three path early and rallied for the show. WORKIN ON A DREAM raced
in range two and three wide, shied inward when the winner lugged in toward him in upper stretch and went only evenly from there. FIX ME A SANDWICH
brushed with the winner at the start, was hustled to the front, set a clear pace in the two path and weakened in the final furlong. PERFECT COVER played
no factor while racing two wide. GRAVEL ROAD had early speed inside and faded. The rider of WORKIN ON A DREAM claimed foul against the winner for
alleged interference in upper stretch but the Stewards found no reason to alter the original order of finish.

Footnotes
FEDERALE sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail and held well clear under a drive. NOMO D'ORO advanced four wide around the
turn, was no match for the winner but finished willingly to be clearly second best. LUCKY JUNIOR was bumped after the start, advanced four wide around
the turn and rallied for the show. GRAN CAUSEWAY broke outwardly, raced well back five wide and rallied belatedly. DOCTOR DUB stumbled at the start,
advanced three wide into contention but faded in the lane. YEI YEI was bumped after the start, raced three wide and never threatened. SUNSHINES OUT
was outrun while racing in the three path. COMMANDER'S INTENT played no factor while racing two wide. SAVAGE MUSIC had brief speed two wide.
TAPITONTHESIDE had only brief speed inside.
