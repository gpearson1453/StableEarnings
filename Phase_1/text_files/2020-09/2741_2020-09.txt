Footnotes
IWASBORNAWINNER saved ground off the leaders, angled out on the turn, wore down the leaders and edged off late. HEROIC OFFICER stalked the
pacesetter outside, bid into the stretch, steadied late between rivals but was up for the place. ROCKFORD GIRL set a clear pace to the stretch, came out
under left handed whip late. STAY SALTY lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. HIGH MATH lacked speed, moved inside and was never in
contention. LISA MILA was urged close up inside then began fading on the turn. The stewards posted an inquiry into the incident in deep stretch with no
change in the order of finish.

SAILOR AGAIN saved ground throughout, bid to the front into the stretch and drew away under moderate urging. HAPPYASCANB stalked the leaders
outside. moved wide in the stretch and closed well while no threat. TOMASCO set the pace inside to the stretch and gradually weakened. INSPIRED
OPTIONS lacked speed outside, was very wide in the stretch and offered some late energy. FOX IN THE FOG broke slowest, rushed up inside then
flattened out. EAGLES CRY forced the pace outside for half a mile and proved empty in the stretch. FOX Z lagged far behind throughout. ALMOST IRISH
chased near the inside and faded badly.

BAPTIZE THE BOY recovered quickly after stumbling at the start, established a long lead inside under rating, was roused in early stretch and had more
than enough left to hold off the closers. ACED raced in the four path while in closest pursuit, made up some ground but wasn't a serious threat. HIZAAM
saved ground and failed to be a serious challenge. SOLOMONIC saved ground while outrun, swung wide but was too late. HE IZ GONE, very wide, failed to
menace. LUCKY HERO was between second flight then tired. FLAT OUT FLASHY showed little.

LADY LUCY LU dueled for half a mile, took over and quickly widened then was under wraps in the final seventy yards. LIGHT UP NIGHT dropped back
early, advanced wide and closed well while no match for the winner. GO METRO GIRL trailed early, bid inside in the stretch and rallied mildly. TIZ A
SHARPIE moved closer after half a mile then proved empty in the stretch. RAGAZZA CARINA saved ground off the pace and was finished after three
quarters. LADY JOANNA was well placed outside the dueling leaders then stopped in the stretch. PABLO'S DREAM hustled up to duel inside briefly then
stopped abruptly. LOYAL AFICIONADA drifted very wide into the first turn and was never in contention. AGAVE QUEEN stopped abruptly after three
furlongs losing contact with her field.

Footnotes
LIVIN A DREAM set the pace inside, remained clear and won under pressure. BON HEIR saved ground, took up chase on the turn, moved out then drifted
wider under left handed pressure and had no late gain. TOP HAT TIZZY, racing in the five path while just off the pace, fell back. PARTY IN THE SAND fell
back early while outside, raced extremely wide into and through stretch and made up some ground. MARNESIA BIG GIRL, three wide while not far back,
came up empty. SPECIAL RISK, four wide and never far back, lacked a rally. MAGALIE, in the four path chasing, tired. TWITTER STORM was never a
factor. BIG RED SEVEN saved ground and tired. ROBIN'S DESTINY, two wide early, drifted out through stretch. FLEUR DE FORCE broke slowly and
showed little.

BELONGS TO BABE well placed outside the dueling pacesetters, bid into the stretch and edged clear late following a long drive. LORDEN'S LOVE vied
outside with a narrow lead, moved clear near the quarter pole but yielded in the final furlong. ISABELLA SMILE allowed to settle outside, was asked for run
on the final turn but lacked a solid rally. ASK SIRI saved ground while outrun and never menaced. GATOR GIRL forced the pace along the inside and was
finished after three quarters.

Footnotes
MASS APPEAL was bothered leaving gate and was far back racing wide, eventually got to the rail, rallied on the turn, split foes in early stretch, angled back
to the rail and won going away. MARCH SCREAMER broke a bit awkwardly, recovered and dueled two wide, then was left with rail. drifted out through the
stretch and was no match. LOAN ME YOUR EAR, two wide, moved out wider near stretch but then flattened out. EASTPORT raced wide and passed tiring
foes. ALLIUM came in leaving the gate, raced between foes and was no factor. HAIL TO THE KING dueled just off the rail, eased back and moved out three
wide and faded through the drive. EL DULZURA bobbled and came out at the start impeding rivals, dueled for the lead then tired. SINCERE MAN saved
ground and tired. DONNIE BRASCO was clobbered leaving the gate then was outrun. BEAU TRACE showed nothing. BILL'S MAFIA, who had to return to
the paddock to correct the number on his saddle cloth, dueled wide and stopped.
