Footnotes
PARATYCACHACA settled off the pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, rallied outside, struck the front near the three-sixteenths pole
and drove clear while drifting in a bit under right-handed urging. SPIN LIGHTNING broke alertly, led early, settled back inside behind the contested pace,
continued to save ground in range around the far turn and rallied inside to gain the place. TRI TRY COLORS raced two wide in midpack early, bid three
wide into the far turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, led to midstretch and was outfinished through the final furlong. HUSBAND IN LAW stalked
the pace three wide around the first turn, two wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. REGGAE PIRATE dueled two wide around the first
turn, drew clear midway down the backstretch, set the pace at the rail around most of the far turn and weakened. MY DEVILS CHILD saved ground to no
avail. SEVILLIAN was outrun inside. NO WORRIES MATE saved ground off the pace for a half, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened.
LONG TOM played no factor while racing two and three wide. REDREAMED was hustled early, dueled inside around the first turn and was through early.

Footnotes
DANCE LIGHTLY stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out near the five-sixteenths pole, reached near even terms near the quarter pole, vied outside to
midstretch then drove clear. WAVERLY SUNSET set the pace along the rail, led to midstretch, was no match late but stayed on well to be clearly second
best. OFFERYOUCANTREFUSE saved ground off the pace, cut the corner into the lane and was along for the show. BUTTON CANDY settled two wide,
went four wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. WEE ARCH failed to menace while racing two wide. PRINGIPESSA lacked early speed
while saving ground, moved up five wide around the far turn and evened out in the lane. ECLIPTICALS DANCER was outrun while racing two and three
wide. MYWALTZINGMATILDA stalked the pace two and three wide and faded around the far turn. MOUSE CAT was reluctant to load, chased the pace
three and four wide and retreated around the far turn. MAKEMEASAMMICH stalked the pace two wide, bid nearing the far turn then retreated around the
bend.

LOXODROME prompted the pace three wide, seized command nearing the three-eighths pole and drew off under a drive. COPPERHEAD CREEK settled
off the pace while racing two wide, split rivals in midstretch and rallied for the place. JUST GOT HITCHED chased the pace two and three wide, lacked the
needed rally and was outfinished for second. TRIPLE A. PLUS vied between foes to upper stretch and weakened. NEGATIVE NICKY failed to menace
while racing three wide. EAGLES CRY set the pace along the rail, tired around the turn, drifted out nearing the lane and retreated. SOMERSET BAY was
sluggish at the start and never involved. NAUGHTY CORINTHIAN was reluctant to load, trailed throughout and was eased in the lane.

keep pace in upper stretch but stayed on willingly and was narrowing the gap late. KELTOI chased the pace four wide and was one-paced in the lane.
CRYSTAL CLEAR failed to menace while racing three and four wide. BRANDYWINES SECRET had early speed inside and faded.

from that rival but was nailed by the winner. HASHTAG WINNING tracked the pace in the clear two wide, took the lead near the seven-sixteenths pole, set
the pace inside around the far turn, battled inside of SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR through most of the lane and weakened late. AIN'T MISBEHAVIN never
threatened while racing three and four wide. VOUCH set the pace along the rail and tired around the far turn. MAIN COOL CAT was outrun while racing two

TIZA WEIGELIA dueled inside of TALLULAH DARLING throughout and prevailed in a game effort. TALLULAH DARLING dueled outside of the winner
throughout and was outfinished. SHECOR lacked early speed, raced two wide around the turn and was along for the show. BAYANNE failed to menace
while racing three wide. HIJINKS never threatened while racing two wide. CAITLYN'S WISH broke in the air, nearly unseating the rider then made little
impact three and four wide. ROCKIN RUTH had brief speed two wide.
