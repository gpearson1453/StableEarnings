Footnotes
SPANISH MATADOR pressed the pace, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, bid upper stretch and drew away then held YZERMAN
safe under light handling. YZERMAN raced in mid pack, angled from three-wide to the rail mid turn then moved outward approaching the stretch and closed
determinedly. CHARLES STREET, away slowly and found himself off the pace, was used early and steadied slightly mid turn when YZERMAN came in
front of him mid stretch and finished all out through the stretch. CAPTAIN VINNIE, away slowly and off the early pace, hugged the rail on the turn then
tendered a mild rally. PAPA TONY forced the pace, dueled briefly early turn, forced issue but was cleared by the leader at the top of the stretch and gave
way. BET ALPHA stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but failed to menace and evened out mid stretch. NORTHERN CRUSADER
showed early speed, was engaged in a brief duel early turn, led into the stretch, was passed quickly and evened out. ITMAKESMEWONDER forced the
early pace, dropped back gradually on the turn and lacked a no rally.

WORDS OF GOLD led into the turn and moved clear, widened into the stretch and held sway in hand. MERINO WOOL settled at the rear, was hustled
four-wide on the turn then closed gamely through the stretch. REDHAIR N FRECKLES lost her path at the start and settled off the pace, was hustled three
to five-wide through the turn then finished gamely. BOSCOBEL broke outward then settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn then showed
some interest late. SHISHKA raced at the back of the pack early, was pinched back early on the turn and again late approaching the stretch, angled out and
rallied gamely. DON'T SMILE LILAH forced the pace, chased three-wide on the turn but had no closing response. LAXMI showed early speed, was headed
near the turn, chased two-wide to the stretch and tired. NORDIC PEARL forced the early pace, dropped back nearing the turn, was hustled three-wide but
lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
BEAU'S BEAUTY was on the lead early from her outside post while under restraint, allowed a rival up her inside into the turn but seemed to always have
that one's measure, cleared off in upper stretch and shook off another challenger down the lane, opening up late. HEART RUSH was three wide stalking the
leaders into the turn, loomed dangerous turning for home, bidding for the front but the winner was too strong, kept to her task to hold the place spot. TIZ
PRICELESS was in mid pack early, came three to four wide to range up late on the turn but could only inch up down the lane to grab the show spot from a
few other closers. BLONDE ATTITUDE trailed before coming off the rail in mid turn to four wide and drifting out into the stretch, was on her wrong lead to
the sixteenth pole before switching and closing while still wide late. ANTHECROWDGOESWILD was four wide down the backside and moved up three wide
into range by the quarter pole, bumped by a rival at the three sixteenths, finishing evenly when between foes late. AFLEET CONNECTION was roused from
her mid pack spot inside to be behind the leaders in upper stretch, bumped a rival when coming off the inside by the three sixteenths, levelling off in the final
sixteenth. MY CANTATA came up inside the winner to duel her into the turn, stayed on until upper stretch but lost ground from that point to the finish.
SUGATI stalked between rivals into the turn but backed up from midway on the bend to the wire.

Footnotes
PREFERRED GUEST stalked the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn, challenged at the top of the stretch and drew clear then widened under a
hand ride. YASINIA stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail and two-wide through the turn then chased through the stretch. I WONDER broke inward
and was steadied, stalked the pace, bid early turn, moved clear, was headed upper stretch, chased, then gave way grudgingly. CHOOSE HOPE was rated
in mid pack, chased two-wide into the stretch then finished gamely to no avail. VINYASA raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn,
chased into the stretch but failed to menace. SWEET SHADES broke slowly and settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, tipped
out at the top of the stretch but never reached contention. SHE'S A TRUE FOX was rated off the pace, came two to four-wide through the turn, chased into
the stretch but was not a threat. FINE LADY broke outward and showed speed getting the lead on the rail, set a reserved pace, was headed early turn and
faded.
