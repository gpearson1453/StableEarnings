DARLENE STRONG fractious behind the starting gate, stalked, led into the far turn, responded to pressure in the stretch and edged clear late. ZOFIA
prompted the pace along the inside, dug in entering the stretch and was worn down late. BAYDAR chased while three wide, loomed a threat leaving the far
turn and came up empty in the stretch. STONECOLD STUNNER void of speed, commenced her bid on the far turn and finished well in the stretch. KONZA
KANDY was rank early and failed to menace. NOCTURNAL MISSION was always outrun. BID FOR POWER swerved out at the start and showed little.

Footnotes
ALLEN'S ROCKET raced forwardly while three wide, forged clear on the far turn and drew off in the stretch. BEACHHEAD chased while four wide,
continued four wide into the stretch and stayed on. POINT OF IMPACT outrun early, commenced his bid far on the turn and lodged a belated three wide
stretch rally. OFF AGAIN ON AGAIN passed tired ones. BRILLIANT BABY led early, was headed on the far turn and yielded in the stretch. BLAME IT ON
JR was outpaced while four wide and came up empty. GERDY'S BOY never menaced. LITE SWITCH was always outrun. RAISE THE RANSOM leaned out
at the start and showed little.
