DAILY FEATURE stalked the pace through the turn drawing even abreast rival in upper stretch moving in tandem prevailing at the end. FOGGY KITTEN
stalked the pace saving ground to upper stretch dueling from the rail matching strides to the end. BROOK'S ON FIRE a step slow early gave a mild rally to
upper stretch edging a bit closer late at mid track. SHIPMANS MAGIC raced evenly throughout lacking more. CHOCOLATE CANDY slow early played no
factor. STARNILLA broke sharply setting the pace through the turn before wilting between horses in upper stretch. TIZ ANNA RAE failed to menace. LUCKY
STIFF gave way on the turn. EAGLES ZONE was always outrun.
