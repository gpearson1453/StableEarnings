Footnotes
ACE NINE NINE settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, closed outside and was up in the final strides. WIN YA WIN
broke out and bumped BRIGHT DAWN at the start, set the pace two wide, dug in inside of foes when confronted with multiple challengers nearing the lane,
put away the pace rivals leaving the eighth pole and led until the final strides. RUNAWAY LUTE steadied early, stalked the pace three wide, bid between
foes nearing the quarter pole then flattened out. BRIGHT DAWN was bumped at the start, moved four wide around the turn, reached near even terms at the
quarter pole but failed to sustain the bid. CASPER SLEW had early speed inside and faded. CROSSTIME was outrun inside.

Footnotes
CHUCK'S DREAM dueled two wide, seized command near the quarter pole, vied to midstretch and drove clear late. BIG BAD BUD dueled inside of the
winner to midstretch and held well enough to save second. BAD SUENO was reluctant to load, saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and
rallied inside a foe to gain the show. THE EXCEPTION lacked speed, raced three and four wide and rallied belatedly. MR. HAND FULL failed to menace
while racing three wide. BILETNIKOFF broke slowly, saved ground and played no factor. FOREFRONT raced off the duel in the clear and had no response.
RUNNER RUNNER INDY trailed outside.

and was up in deep stretch under moderate left-handed urging. JAG stalked the pace from the rail, got through inside in upper stretch, took the lead leaving
the eighth pole, pulled away from the pacesetters but was unable to resist the winner in the final seventy yards. ROCK SOLID GOLFER pressed the pace
two wide, took the lead nearing the eighth pole but was outfinished. SOLAR WARMING set the pace along the rail and weakened in the final eighth.
ISMUSBEMYLUCKYDAY never threatened while racing two wide. DASHING LOU stalked the pace three wide and came up empty. BARTON HOLT saved
ground to no avail. LITTLE LEO was outrun while racing two wide. YEAR OF THE KITTEN was bumped at the start, raced three wide and never threatened.

SPRING EMPEROR tracked the pace two wide between rivals, bid three wide around the far turn, was floated out turning for home, took a narrow lead in
upper stretch, dueled outside of CHARGING LION through the lane, lost the lead near the sixteenth pole, continued on gamely through the wire and
prevailed late. CHARGING LION prompted the pace two wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, drifted out entering the lane, dueled inside of the
winner through the stretch, regained the lead near the sixteenth marker but was outgamed late. JAVELIN raced off the pace inside, advanced between
rivals around the far turn, bid inside of the top two nearing the eighth pole but was no match for those in the final furlong. ELEMENTARY never threatened
while racing three wide. PUMPKIN STAR raced four wide throughout, made a middle move but flattened out. SOUTHERN CAL chased the pace inside and
faded. LINDA'S NEKIA set the pace in the two path and tired around the far turn. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF CHARGING LION
AGINAST THE WINNER WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
PETES PRIDE was four wide between foes entering the first turn, rated back to save some ground behind the other four rivals around the first turn, moved
up inside down the backstretch, advanced two wide around the far turn, reached near even terms near the quarter pole, dueled outside through the lane and
prevailed. VICTORY TIME stumbled at the start but was still immediately in front, set the pace along the rail, drew off down the backstretch, remained clear
past the five-sixteenths pole, dug in inside of the winner from the quarter pole, dueled inside through the lane and just missed in a game try.
JENNYANYSPOT stalked the pace four and three wide, lacked a response under heavy pressure around the far turn and held well clear of the rest. I AM A.
LURING had brief speed three wide. ALEXA G vied two wide around the first turn and was through after a half.

DOUBLE FIREBALL set the pace off the rail, kicked clear nearing the far turn, vied outside of DONYA'S MAGIC through upper stretch, came in a bit and
forced that one into the gap in midstretch then kicked clear under a drive. PRINCESS NINA was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside early,
advanced four wide around the far turn, closed outside and was up for the place in deep stretch. DONYA'S MAGIC stalked the pace three wide, angled in to
the rail entering the far turn, bid inside of the winner nearing the lane, dueled inside to midstretch, was herded into the gap in midstretch, had no trouble
angling back out soon after, could not keep pace with the winner from there and lost second late. MAGICAL MESA settled off the pace while racing three
wide, advanced three wide around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. HONOR YOUR MOTHER saved ground to no avail. HARDLY SOCIAL lacked
early speed, raced four wide around both turns and improved position in the lane. SINEAD RAID hit the starting gate, raced well back two wide early and
made little impact. OH SO JAZZY was fractious pre-race, raced two wide and played no factor. NURSE RACHETT was in range inside but was through
early. TUA was bumped at the start, checked entering the first turn, raced two wide and never threatened. LADY QUINTESSA dueled outside of the winner
and retreated while racing very wide around the far turn. MICK'SBESTBETYET was outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
UNMATCHABLE stalked the pace four wide, seized command in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. ROOKIE SALSA broke a bit slowly, advanced
between rivals down the backstretch, vied two wide to upper stretch, was no match for the winner but stayed on willingly to be a clear second. BIG
HAMBONE lacked speed, raced three wide, continued on his left lead in the lane and was along for the show. CANDYGRAMFORMONGO led early, chased
inside around the turn and came up empty in the lane. JUSTIN FRONT exchanged bumps with TALENTED SON early, chased the pace two wide and faded
through the lane. WONDER IN vied three wide between and tired in the lane. TALENTED SON exchanged bumps with BIG HAMBONE early, saved ground
and played no further factor.
