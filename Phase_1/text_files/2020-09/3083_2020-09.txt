and was roused on the far turn but had no response. TRICKERATION was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the
stretch had no kick. KLASSY DELIGHT stalked from the inside but chased on the far turn and came up empty. TARAVILA was well back and showed

Footnotes
STARDUST KITTEN had no speed, gained ground on the turn and from the four path through the stretch was kept to task. D'S MULLIGAN stalked the early
leaders and was a factor on the turn but was outfinished. MISS LESTER MURPHY was in range and roused on the turn but had no late kick. GOLDEN G G
was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but needed more. PRINCESSA FIONA was away alertly but chased on the turn and from the five path at the top
of the stretch was no threat. SMART N QUICK broke outward and trailed the field on the turn but passed tired foes through the stretch. SNOW SCENE was
in mid pack and hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. MAXIMA ONLY was hustled early and had a slim lead
on the turn but dropped back through the stretch. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON PRINCESSA FIONA AGAINST STARDUST KITTEN FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
DYNAMITE KARMA was away alertly, a factor on the turn and drifted out through the stretch but held sway. JACK BEANSTALK showed speed from the
inside and had a slim lead on the turn but was no match for the winner. PRECIOUS BADGE was unhurried early and moved up on the turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch needed more. LEGAL GUMP was off the pace, saved ground on the turn and finished evenly. SHANGASSAH was well back
and trailed the field on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch gained gradually. HANDSOME LIKE ME was hustled from the inside and
dueled on the turn but had nothing left. LEWNSKYSWILDAFFAIR had no speed and was roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
had no response.

NEW YORK MINT was off the pace, gained ground on the turn and rallied to get up in time. STORMY SUZIE was away alertly and roused from the inside
on the turn but was outgunned. PIRANO was up close and a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. MISS
VERRAZANO set the pace and had a clear lead on the turn but gave way through the stretch. MAZIKEEN was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but
from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. RASPBERRY WILD was well back and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. KINZUA
was in range but checked on the turn and failed to fire. FLATOUTONAMISSION stalked the early leader but chased on the turn and dropped back through

Footnotes
I IDOLIZE YOU was in range, roused from between foes on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. BEEN WAITING was
away alertly, a factor on the turn and had the lead from the four path in upper stretch but failed to hold. HIDDEN ARTIFACT was off the pace and moved up
on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch evened out. SILENT CONTEMPT showed speed and set the pace, had the lead on the turn but
had nothing left. SLEEK IDEA was hustled early and raced evenly on the turn but was not a factor. DIVINE AMI had no speed, trailed the field on the turn
and from the five path at the top of the stretch had no impact. OBTAINED was up close early but chased on the turn and failed to fire.

Footnotes
KILKENNY PROSPECT stalked the early leaders, was a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best.
AMERICAN DRIVEN was hustled early, had a slim lead on the far turn and was second best in a good effort. IM NO SAINT was off the pace, gained ground
on the far turn and was up for show. PICKHIMUPSUP was unhurried early and had a mild gain on the far turn but leveled off. SOUL N' SPIRIT showed no
speed and moved up on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. LORD PIETRO was in mid pack and raced evenly on
the far turn but was not a factor. TIZ TAP TANGO was well back and closed the gap on the far turn in a dull effort. BOURBON PARTY set the pace but lost
ground on the far turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch was empty. VYTRUVIAN was in range but chased on the far turn and dropped back
through the stretch.
