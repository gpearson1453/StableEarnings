Footnotes
AIKEN TO BE TAKIN broke outwardly at the start bumping OCELIA causing that rival to check, then was well placed on the backstretch, made a bid
between rivals at the nine sixteenths pole, then dueled for the lead on the far turn, took command past the quarter pole, then drew off in the stretch under a
few whip urgings to the sixteenth pole, then was wrapped up late while proving much the best. STARGAZER LILY was four wide into the first turn, then went
up to vie for the lead three wide, then dueled with the winner to the three eighths pole, but proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second best.
OCELIA was bumped at the start, then had to check shortly after the start causing her to be in the back early, advanced towards the inside on the far turn,
but proved to be no match for the top two while clearly besting the rest. DASH OF SIMPLICITY broke inward at the start bumping a rival, then raced on the
inside before tiring after a half mile. JOKINGLY broke inwardly at the start, vied for the lead on the inside before giving way. AROSE FOR KARA was five
wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four wide then stopped. The jockey of #2 OCELIA claimed foul against the winner for interference leaving the gate,
after reviewing the tapes the stewards ruled there to be no change.

Footnotes
AKTULGALI was allowed to settle early on the inside, advanced on the far turn to move into contention, slipped through on the inside leaving the second
turn to gain the advantage, shook clear past the sixteenth pole, then held on late to prove best, driving. GOOD FIRST was well placed early and raced on
the inside on the backstretch, then eased out past the quarter pole to launch a bid, came into the stretch four wide, closed well in the drive but was too late.
BREW PUB set the pace while racing off the rail, shook clear on the second turn, then was headed entering the stretch, gave way grudgingly to best the
rest. MOUNTAIN KING was bumped at the start, then raced from between rivals on the backstretch, swung out six wide for the drive but offered no punch
when roused. REDOUX stumbled at the start then bumped MOUNTAIN KING, failed to menace while saving ground. GUNFIGHTERJUSTICE was bumped
at the start, then went up to stalk the pace three wide, then was in between rivals past the half mile pole, tired. HIGH SEASON was four wide into the first
turn, then made a four wide middle move to vie for the lead around the half mile pole then tired.

Footnotes
STURGILL tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn while in hand, assumed command by the quarter pole, then was clear by the
eighth pole after one right handed whip, then jockey fanned the whip a few times by the sixteenth pole while drawing out, then was wrapped up late to prove
much the best. BOLD ADVENTURE was reserved early, then came in to the stretch three wide to offer a mild late rally while no match to the winner, second
best. TIME HEIST chased the early pace and made a mild bid three wide on the turn but was empty in the drive, bested rest. AIR TEMPLE was bumped at
the start, swung out four wide for the drive but offered no rally. TRIPPER JOHN was away alertly to set the pace while clear, was headed past the five
sixteenths pole by the winner then faltered. BATTLE HONOURS was not a threat while on the inside. ULTIMATE FIGHTER showed brief speed the
stopped.

SHES THE CAUSE was rated early and made a four wide bid while between rivals past the five sixteenths, continued that bid four wide in the stretch, went
on even terms with pace setter by the sixteenth pole, then slowly wore down that foe to edge clear late under a drive. DA HIGH COMMISSION set the pace
from the inside, then came off the rail entering the stretch, remained clear past the eighth pole but could not hold off the winner late in a game effort.
GOLDEN COMMAND was well placed towards the inside, then made a inside bid in the stretch but needed more. VIVIAN was allowed to settle early, made
a five wide move on the turn to draw into contention but hung late. QUIET CONTENDER prompted the pace three wide, then was shuffled back past the five
sixteenths pole, then offered no significant gain while still three wide. GINORMOUS chased the early pace and came into the stretch three wide but offered
no rally. MIRACLES TAKE TIME had no rally while saving ground.

Footnotes
MANEUVERED was settled back early, advanced on the inside on the far turn, had to steady past the quarter pole, angled out six wide in the stretch for
racing room, closed with a rush to get up in time under a drive. AQUALITYINDIVIDUAL was allowed to settle early, made a five wide move past the quarter
pole, then hit the front past the sixteenth pole but was caught late to just miss. HURRICANE JAKE vied for the lead on the inside and stayed on gamely
while being outfinished by the top two. PROMISED pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid to duel for the lead on the turn, but hung late.
RAISON KARTER was allowed to settle early swung out wide for the stretch but offered no significant rally. GIANT'S FORREST tracked the early pace
three wide, then made a menacing four wide move on the turn but flattened out late. OUT COLD was well placed while two wide but faded. Internal fractions
were omitted due to s timer malfunction.
