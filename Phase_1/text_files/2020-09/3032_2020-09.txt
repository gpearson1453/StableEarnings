Footnotes
IRISH TRICK sat off the pace from the five path, fanned three wide into the far turn, gained the lead at the top of the stretch and was kept to task under
handling. PARKING PERMIT raced near the back while three wide through the backstretch, took closer order at the three eighths marker, circled into the
lane and gained quickly through the stretch but was no real threat to the winner. WYE CROSS allowed to settle inside, moved up closer into contention
entering the far turn, chased four wide at the quarter pole and was outkicked, finishing best of the others. WISER TIMES settled outside through the
backstretch, chased into the drive and passed tiring rivals late. ROMAN STEEL set the pace, took some pressure from MISTER MACHO MAN near the
three eighths, was overtaken approaching the quarter pole and gave way. MISTER MACHO MAN prompted the pace from the four path, moved up
alongside ROMAN STEEL at the three eighths but had nothing left in reserve for the drive. FLAT OUT LEADER trailed throughout. **DELAY OF RACE-
There was a delay of race due to an accident in the previous race.

Footnotes
LA MER sat in striking position while three wide through the backstretch, moved up alongside CAN'T TOUCH THIS at the three sixteenth marker then
edged away late. LADY RORSCHACH tracked outside under a snug hold, chased the leaders into the lane, found her best stride late and got up for place.
CAN'T TOUCH THIS cleared the lead quickly then saved ground while showing the way through the backstretch, responded to challenge from LA MER into
the lane and weakened in the final sixteenth. NORTHERN BREEZE trailed outside, advanced in the final turn and offered a mild late gain in the lane.
PIPERS JOY checked inside entering the backstretch, stalked inside in the early stages and tired through the lane. CALCULATING dismounted rider in gate
and showed little. AVALON saved ground and had no response when called upon.

Footnotes
ZICATELA broke quickly then disputed the early pace outside of SOLO RING leaving the backstretch, dropped back around the turn, battled back gamely
between rivals into the lane, kept on determinedly late stretch under steady urging and prevailed under a long hard drive. SOLO RING pushed forward early
then contested the pace from the five eighths marker, gained an advantage in the far turn over ZICATELA, was under attack into the lane then responded to
the challenge, rallied determinedly inside was bested late. MIDNIGHT SHAKE never far back while outside, was urged upper stretch, gained quickly outside
in the final sixteenth and got up just in time. WEEKEND WIZARD sat in striking distance from the three path, moved up three wide to challenge the leaders
at the quarter pole, gained a slim advantage over inside rivals and was edged out in the final yards. ALL UNDER CONTROL chased the dueling
pacesetters, came under coaxing from the rail then angled out at the head of the stretch and lacked running room in traffic late. MR. DAZZLE trailed the in
the first flight and lacked a closing response through the drive. ACE OF DIAMONDS trailed and bid. REGAL CANDY gapped early and offered a late mild
bid.

EVER TRUE came away with the leading flight, disputed the early pace inside of WILSMAN, inherited the lead at the three eighths marker, drew clear into
the lane then widened under intermittent urging. OUR MONEY CAT saved ground early inside, swung out into the lane while taking closer order, rallied
outside into the stretch but was no match for the winner. CAPTAIN WAY steadied leaving the chute, chased leaving the backstretch, lodged a bid at the
quarter pole and finished evenly. WILSMAN set a pressured early pace, was overtaken nearing the three eighths, chased the leader into the lane then
flattened out late stretch. GAME READY chased in second flight and lacked the rally needed. POOR RUBEN chased throughout. ITS ALL GOOD broke
alertly then prompted while three wide through the backstretch and was done early.

Footnotes
GUNN WITH THE WIND under a snug hold leaving the opening turn, raced wide through the backstretch, took closer order in the far turn then drove four
wide, rallied three wide outside and edged away late. ARCTIC REIGN went four wide through the opening turn, rated off the pace while five to six wide
through the backstretch, moved up outside the leaders at the five sixteenth marker, gained a slim advantage approaching the stretch, rallied determinedly
between rivals through the drive and dug in late to earn place honors. POCKET DIAL stalked the early pacesetters from the three path, lodged a bid nearing
the five sixteenth, rallied inside under handling, gained a narrow advantage with a sixteenth remaining and was out finished. SILVER PRAIRIE brushed in
the opening turn, chased three wide leaving the backstretch, dropped back in the far turn and finished with a late mild gain. IMPERIAL WOOD under a
strong hold from along the rail into the backstretch, saved ground inside, came under coaxing in the final turn and was unable to improve through the drive.
EASTER HALO hustled away then contested the early pace outside of MARIA'S MAGIC, disposed of rival then was soon overtaken and had little left in
reserve for the drive. MARIA'S MAGIC vied inside through the opening turn, disputed the pace through the backstretch, was unable to keep pace with the
field and gave way in the lane. LOOKIN FOR MADDIE lugged out in the opening turn, chased through the backstretch and failed to menace.
FLANDERLAND showed little.
