clearly second best. MORRICONE chased the early pace from the outside, held a forward position for the drive but could not keep pace. READY FOR
LOVE stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded entering the drive and rallied late. GOTIGER SPECIAL could
only improve position. WICKED FITZ chased the early pace from the outside and tired. SHADY GRADY was no factor. SIR OVERANALYZE was no threat.

Footnotes
SUPER BRADY dueled from the inside early, battled through the turn, gained a clear margin at the eighth pole and held sway. DADDY COOL CAT dueled
from the outside early, fought through the turn but could not match strides. DAVID'S GRACE broke in at the start crowding rivals early, chased the early
pace from the inside, responded entering the drive and rallied late. LONE TROOPER pressed the early pace inside, remained forward but could not keep
pace. DUBLIN YINZ MONEY forced the early pace outside but came up empty in the drive. PRETTY GUILTY went evenly. IRONIC forced the early pace
and tired. MR TRUE was crowded at the start and had a late try. CHROME PRODUCTION was crowded at the start and no factor. JITTERY TOM was
never close.
