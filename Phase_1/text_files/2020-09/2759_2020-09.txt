Footnotes
SHE'S A TROOPER never far back, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, shook clear, drifted ot the
rail, then drifted out and lasted. FROSTY LINZ well placed and inside, pulled to the lead, shook clear through the second turn, then stayed on when
challenged in the stretch, steadied and could not gain in the late going. DUCHESS OF DUBLIN allowed to settle, looped up four and five wide through the
second turn, fanned widest into the lane and closed well for the show. INDEHERE allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn,
bid four wide into the lane and got up for a share. IWILLBEFIRST allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, came through
inside and flattened out. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, drifted in
and faded. RIDOUT ROAD well placed and three wide, held position three wide through the turn, then had no rally. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL tracked the
pace and faded after a half. SOLDAT THE TOP set the early pace off the rail and faded through the second turn. BLUEBERRY DUDETTE well placed and
four wide, steadily lost ground and was outrun. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF
