Footnotes
EASY EYES away alertly, set a pressured pace for a half then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best under a strong hand ride. BLU
HAWAII pressed the winner two wide into the stretch, was hard used and gamely held on for second by the narrowest of margins. ANNMARIA altered
course outside soon after the start, was never far back and finished with good courage in the six path just missing second. LIGHTNING MISS had speed
from the start along the inside through lacked racing room early then went evenly. EOWYN'S PARADISE with the second flight two wide, checked on heels
near the nine sixteenths pole, remained close into the stretch then failed to offer the needed response. BEAUTIFUL CREATURE vied for the lead three wide
into the stretch then faded. I'M THAT BIRD trailed.

MA MOO POWER broke in front, set all the pace while getting slow fractions, widened into the stretch and won under brisk handling. BELTON AVE trailed
into the far turn, closed along the rail into the stretch, sifted out to the three path late and finished clear for second. GOOD ENERGY well placed, went
evenly in the four path. BLUE MONARCH passed tiring rivals in the six path through the final furlong. B WHYOH B close up from the start, inched closer
along the inside through the far turn then came up empty. MADDIE SON checked on winners' heels entering the clubhouse turn while along the rail, angled
out to the three path, chased the pace into the stretch then gave way.

inside, was no match while well clear for second. GIOIELLI never far back, finished with good courage near the inside. KANHOLDHERWINE chased the
leaders from the three and four paths and went evenly. NATALIA'S TEMPLE failed to menace. LOST A SOCK close up into the turn weakened. SEE YOU

OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE TURN. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF

Footnotes
FRIENDLY MERGER chased the pace from the inside into the turn, shifted outside the lead, rallied to make the lead before the furlong marker and finished
full of run to win as much the best. BEACH BABE allowed to settle, rallied through the stretch in the four then five paths and got up for second. JUDGE
REESE well placed, swung wide and finished with good courage in the eight path. RACEY WEEKEND trailed out in the seven path into the stretch then
closed willingly in the six path. BACCARAT broke in front and quickly opened a daylight lead, set the pace into the stretch then weakened in the final
furlong. CAUSE OF LOVE was no factor. SWEET BETTY JOYCE had brief speed. THE CALICO LADY chased the pace into the turn, suffered and injury,
pulled up at the top of the stretch and was vanned off.
