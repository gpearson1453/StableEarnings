EXOGEN was bit slow into stride, raced off the pace, made a four wide run on the turn, dueled with TWIN BRIDGES in upper stretch, gained command and
pulled away under urging. EMIRATES AFFAIR was loose briefly behind the gate, then a bit fractious reloading, chased the pace, bid three wide on the turn,
steadied in tight at the quarter pole, then rallied outside in the final furlong. PRAY FOR RAIN raced between foes early, inside on the turn, angled out and
rallied mildly outside for third. TWIN BRIDGES stalked close up three wide, bid two wide on the turn, dueled with the winner in the stretch, then weakened.
MISS PARFAIT raced close up on the rail, steadied nearing the turn, then came two wide into the lane and closed mildly on the rail. KYLEMORE CAT raced
off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. INERTIA raced three wide early, settled off the pace and did not factor. BRONX
CHERIE set the pace racing in the two path, dueled inside on the turn and gave way. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of EMIRATES AFFAIR against the
winner was dismissed.

INCONVENIENT FACTS raced three wide early, settled off the pace, advanced on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, launched a late rally outside
and was up late to win going away. VOLADOR tracked along the inside, then between rivals, saved ground on the far turn, rallied on the rail and surged late
to get up for second. MATINEE GIRL set the pace on the inside, opened up a clear lead, widened turning for home, weakened in deep stretch and lost
second at the wire. APPRECIATE raced three wide off the pace, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. GIVEITSOMEWELLIE raced off
the pace, had an inside trip, chased the leader on the far turn and lacked a winning bid. LAYLA'S VOYAGE raced off the pace and passed tired ones in the
lane. COUNTESS JESSICA steadied entering the first turn, raced off the pace, jumped tracks in the course near the half mile marker and dropped back.
SYZYGY raced four wide early, three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, came four wide into the lane and tired. DESBORDES stalked the pacesetter
