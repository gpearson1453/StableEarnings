Footnotes
BEE WINGS rallied along the inside on the turn angling off the rail in upper stretch surging clear in the two path. SUMMER HOURS pressured the pace
shaking clear on the turn, digging in from the two path in upper stretch would falter near the rail late. SHYLA GIRL tracked the pace through the turn bidding
evenly in the four path down the lane. ORBITAL DEITY squeezed at the break would respond in upper stretch bidding in close quarters from the four path
finishing well. AZNAVOUR raced evenly through the turn racing six and five wide down the lane needing more. DREAMINGOFROSEALLA veered out at the
break, chased early coming five wide into upper stretch being blocked and steadied near mid track late. UNBRIDLED'S GIRL pressed an early lead then
chased on the turn wearing out along the inside the final eighth. DAMA DE NOCHE played no factor. MAYAS MIRACLE raced mid pack tiring in upper
stretch. FIELD REALITY was always outrun. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF DREAMINGOFROSEALLA AGAINST THE RIDER OF ORBITAL
DEITY FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
DENVER SKY moved on pace wresting the lead on the far turn drawing off in upper stretch holding off surging rival late. CABO HEADACHE went evenly
through backside angling five wide to upper stretch hitting stride when closing in with every step late. IT'S A MAJOR AWARD tracked the pace chasing on
the far turn, angled to mid track in upper stretch would weaken some finishing evenly. RESISTANCE JAK stalked the pace advancing to pressure from the
half into the far turn, wavered in upper stretch dropping off in the four path. ROW THE BOAT worked the pace on a narrow lead to the far turn, overtaken
there had little left in upper stretch. TRAFFIC THIEF pressured the pace through the backside extending on the far turn wilting in upper stretch.
CANTANKEROUS BOBBY raced evenly before flattening out to upper stretch. PRE FLIGHT was always outrun.

DAWNMINO bid four deep at the half taking a short lead through the far turn shaking clear in upper stretch widening as much the best. FACTUM'S
REWARD prompted the pace chasing on the far turn, no match down the lane saved place along the inside. PUNAHELE tracked evenly pursuing through
the far turn racing four wide down the lane going evenly to best the others. TROPICAL RUNNINGS raced evenly angling five wide into upper stretch posing
no menace there. PATTY'S MISCHIEF pressed the early pace then gave way on the far turn. BLACK QUEEN pressed the early pace then wilted on the far
