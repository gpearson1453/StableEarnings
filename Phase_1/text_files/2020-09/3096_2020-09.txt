Footnotes
COMPLEX JUSTICE was gunned to the lead to set the pace from the inside while clear, then was pressured past the quarter pole, jockey dropped whip
past the three sixteenths pole, then drifted out past the eighth pole bumping with ONE EYED JOHNNY causing that rival to take up, then was corrected with
a hundred yards to go while drawing clear. ONE EYED JOHNNY stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid past the quarter pole, was lugging
in approaching the furlong marker, then had to check leaving the eighth pole, went on to be clearly second best. GO RODNEY was allowed to settle early,
came into the stretch five wide to finish well for the show award while no threat to the top two. HIGHEST PRAISE stalked the early pace and was in the two
path past the three eighths pole but was empty. INDIAN SHOW was allowed to settle early, but lacked a rally while saving ground. DAKOTA JUSTICE failed
to menace while on the inside. The stewards posted an INQUIRY and there was a jockeys claim of foul the unofficial second place finisher versus the
unofficial winner for alleged interference around the eighth pole. After reviewing the video replays the stewards ruled that COMPLEX JUSTICE to be
disqualified from first and placed second for interference in the stretch.

drive. PEGASUS ON THE GO was three wide into the first turn, then went on to set the pace on the inside down the backstretch, was headed leaving the
three sixteenths pole, could not fend off that rival while staying on for the place. DOX FOLLY was five wide into the first turn while trailing, then advanced
three to four wide on the second turn, but hung in the stretch. MEMPHISINMAY was inside into the first turn, then angled out three wide to stalk the pace
three wide on the backstretch, moved back to the rail entering the stretch while fading. BLACK SALT was inside into the first turn, then was settled in the
back, came five wide into the drive but offered no rally. DERBY EXPRESS dropped back. CRAFTY SPECTOR was five wide into the first turn, then failed to
menace while wide throughout.

NUTCRACKER BALLET vied for the lead on the inside to the top of the stretch, then was shut off past the three sixteenths pole by EMILY LANE, angled out
for racing room to make a bid at that rival nailing her at the wire, driving. EMILY LANE was between horses on the first turn, rated back out of that to tracked
the pace four wide on the backstretch, made a four wide bid past the quarter pole to assume command entering the stretch, drifted in past the three
sixteenths pole, was corrected with a left handed stick past the eighth pole while drawing clear, then was nailed late while under hand urging. HAWAIIAN
MEMORIES was reserved early, split rivals while advancing past the quarter pole, swung out five wide for the drive to offer a mild late rally.
DONTYOUREMEMBER chased the early pace on the inside then weakened final quarter of a mile. PEEKACHICA was allowed to settle early and made a
five wide middle move to be in contention on the far turn, but flattened out. MYSTICAL JUSTICE vied for the lead three wide then gave way. The stewards
posted the INQUIRY into the running at the top of the stretch but the race was left as is.

DOUBLE ADVANTAGE was well rated early, made a four wide on the far turn then came into the stretch three wide while dueling for the lead to the eighth
pole, then drew clear in the final sixteenth to prove best under right handed urging. FLYING SAMURAI stalked the pace setter three wide, made a bid on the
far turn to gain a short advantage past the quarter pole, then dueled on the inside of the winner by the eighth pole, but could not stay with that rival late while
second best. BAKER'S MAN was void of early speed, advanced towards the inside on the far turn, angled out in the stretch but lacked the needed rally
while besting the rest. BE MY DOCTOR was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the stretch but had no rally. WARRIOR'S REMARK was reserved
early, swung out six wide for the drive to pass the tiring rivals. DANANG keen early on the inside and up close to the pace before tiring. FIVE STAR
COLONEL set the pace for six furlongs in hand then gave way.

hand ride despite being bumped late. MO HAWK was clear early, bore out approaching the wire and bumped foes. TREASURE TROVE was unrushed, bid
four wide at the quarter pole, surged, then was bumped and checked late. MORNING SOCIAL stalked in the four path, bid at the three-eighths pole, then
hung in the stretch. LONTANI stalked inside, bid at the quarter pole, then faltered in the drive. POLE SETTER pressed the pace between foes, bid at the
three-eighths, then gave way in the stretch. SILVER N LAI stalked inside then gave way. MY BARILEY was squeezed back at the start. DEVIL'S DUE
WEST stalked in the three path for a half mile before fading. Following an objection by the rider of TREASURE TROVE against SPACE MOUNTAIN and

STAGE READY was reserved early, advanced on the far turn, came in to the stretch six wide, closed with a rush to get up at the wire, driving. STRONG
TIDE was rated early while three wide, made a bold move to split rivals past the quarter pole, continued that bid to lead late but was nailed at the wire to just
miss, good effort. QUALITY STEP tracked the early pace and made a bold three wide move on the far turn to draw clear, remained clear leaving the furlong
marker but hung in deep stretch. CALIFORNIA SWING was void of early speed, swung out nine wide for the drive, rallied. AFLEET ASCENT was well
placed early, swung out seven wide for the drive but had no rally. CHASIN CHARLIE had a four wide trip but was empty late. HIGHER AUTHORITY stalked
the early pace three wide and tired. DARK OAK failed to menace. HIP HIP JORGE was through after a half mile.
