KAUAI settled well, advanced on the far turn, was swung four wide for the stretch run, came in during the final eighth and sustained his rally to prevail.
MINECRAFT MANIAC reserved, commenced his bid far on the turn and finished well while racing closest to the inside rail in the stretch. NET GAIN taken in
hand early, moved closer on the far turn, altered course while closing ground in the stretch but could not reach the top pair. IRISH WIND never menaced.
TIN BADGE sprinted clear, set a demanding pace and faltered. DOMIKATE reared at the start and dislodged his rider. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THERE
WAS A STWEARD'S INQUIRY AND A RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL INTO VARIOUS INCIDENTS DURING THE RACE. AFTER REVIEWING VIDEOTAPED
REPLAYS, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED KAUAI, WHO WAS FIRST PAST THE POST, FOR INTERFERENCE AND PLACED HIM THIRD.

MYWOMANFROMTOKYO seized command at the outset, edged clear leaving the far turn and held sway in the stretch under solid handling. ZELLA ROSE
settled nicely, advanced on the far turn and stayed on well in the stretch. SNAPY GAL stalked the pace, was outpaced leaving far the turn and kept on in the
stretch to secure a minor share. STONECOLD STUNNER leaned out at the start, was outrun and finished well in the stretch. HELLO DARLING raced
forwardly while four wide, moved closer on the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. ZOFIA saved ground, closed ground into the stretch and came up
empty in the late going.
