BE QUICK away alertly and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the turn, and closed one out from the rail in the drive while never seriously
threatened. FINDING WAYS away well, and chased the leader through the turn while racing two out from the rail, and closed willingly two wide in the drive
to prove second best. RAILWAY broke sharply and chased the leader one out from the rail through the turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to
prove easily best of the rest. GOLD POST chased the leaders four wide into the turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive while unable to make a
late impact. PREDESTINED was slow into stride, while racing well behind the leaders in the run to the turn, and while saving ground throughout failed to
make an impact. HOPEY hopped at the start, and trailed throughout. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of
RAILWAY lodged a claim of foul against the rider of BE QUICK for alleged interference approaching the turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed,
and no change was made to the original order of finish.

SIR BREGOVIC away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, maintained his advantage in the run down the backstretch, held a
clear lead into the final turn, and widened his margin late while being ridden out in deep stretch. HARRY'S HAMMER broke sharply and was allowed to
settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, advanced into a tracking trip from along the rail midway down the
backside, rallied two wide through the final turn and closed one out from the rail in the drive to prove second best. CAUSIN' HAVOC settled off the early
while racing one out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to get up for a share. FORT LANGLEY
away alertly and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response in the drive while finishing three out from the rail. SPECULATOR tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing
two out from the rail, maintained his tracking trip in the run down the backstretch, but began to weaken approaching the final turn, and had little to offer late.

SPROG broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final
turn and held DORYS DARIN safely at bay late to prove best. DORYS DARLIN stalked the leaders from along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied
smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, was in tight quarters midway through the turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to prove second
best. ANIMA stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished from along the rail
in the drive to garner a share. SATURNA unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed with late interest
four wide in the drive. CUSHMAN ROAD away well and tracked the leader three wide entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, but
faded in the stretch drive. MIS VIOLA away alertly and tracked the leader one out from the rail entering the backstretch, struggled to hold her position in the

inside in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, but was outfinished late while racing two wide in the drive. RODE TO
