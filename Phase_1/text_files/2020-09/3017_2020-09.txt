NO HARBOR IN SIGHT was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with LAST ONE STANDING, disposed of that rival after going a half,
opened a clear lead into the stretch and was fully extended to hold off the closing GRAYCASTER to gamely prevail. GRAYCASTER settled off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was gaining on the winner late to just miss. MISO FAST broke awkwardly,
raced just off the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to gain late. ITS ALLABOUT JERRY lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and
finished with some late run. STYLE DADDY steadied soon after the start then was allowed to settle, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in and out in
mid-stretch and did not menace. HURRICANE FORCE raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. LAST ONE
STANDING was off a step slow, rushed to contend, pressed the pace of the winner while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

KERRALIA was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with UNLIMITEDDATAPLAN from the inside, disposed of that rival after going a half,
opened a clear lead with a furlong to run and drew off with complete authority. FINISHED MY P H D was off a step slow, rushed to contend, moved
four-wide through the turn and finished with good energy to gain the place. UNLIMITEDDATAPLAN broke sharply to dispute the early fractions with the
winner while racing four-wide, gave way to that rival after going a half and stayed on to hold the show. GABBA GABBA HAY lacked early foot, raced
five-wide through the turn and did not menace. JACOMINA broke in, was forwardly placed from off the rail and weakened after going a half. COASTAL

Footnotes
DUTTON sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, increased his margin into the stretch and won as the easiest of winners. CAMDEN
HIGH raced unhurried early, moved from off the rail through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. JOHN'S
ON POINT chased the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that foe in the drive and gave way late for the place. ZEYNEP settled off the leaders
early, moved five-wide through the turn, drifted inward in mid-stretch and finished evenly when straightened away. DAVID NOSE BEST was off slow then
allowed to settle, raced four-wide through the turn, steadied with a furlong to run and did not offer a bid. COASTAL RUN chased the leaders while racing
three-wide, weakened and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
PREMIER LEAGUE was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, circled the field six-wide, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew off. STANLEY'S
WAVE was away in good order to press the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run but could not match strides with
the winner late. DROPYOURBUFFS settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly
late. ARUGULA raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, checked in mid-stretch, angled out and finished willingly. ALESUND
lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with a belated bid. BLEU MUSKET
broke sharply to dispute the early fractions while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. COOLER THAN YOU was off slow, lagged early,
raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TIZASTONE was bumped at the break, lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did
not menace. FLAT OUT FEISTY was bumped at the start, dueled for the lead from the inside for a half and weakened.
