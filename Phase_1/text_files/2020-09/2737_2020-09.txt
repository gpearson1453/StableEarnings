was in range, had a good position on the turn and was up for place. FAFA FOOEY was unhurried early, a factor on the turn and had a bid from the four path
in mid stretch but needed more. STATION ROCK was in touch and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no real threat.

THE DR'S SLIPPERS settled off the pace, was a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. INDIAN'S
GETUPNGO set the pace, had a slim lead on the far turn and from the three path through the stretch held place. ACROSS THE CHANNEL was in mid pack
and hustled along on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. CHEER FOR GRACE tracked the early leader but chased on
the far turn and leveled off through the stretch. CASPER JOE stalked the leaders from the inside and was roused on the far turn but from the four path at the
top of the stretch had no response. YES YOUR HONOR was well back and showed nothing in a dull effort.

Footnotes
JOIN THE CLUB tracked the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and with the lead at the top of the stretch held sway. BEAR CUB settled off the pace,
gained ground on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. J M R SILENT LAKE set the pace and had a slim lead on the turn
but from the four path at the top of the stretch gave way. SPANISH TOWN stalked the leaders but chased on the turn and had nothing left. SPARKISH was
up close early but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

touch, saved ground on the turn and gained gradually through the stretch. LEWNSKYSWILDAFFAIR was off the pace, had a mild gain on the turn and from
the six path at the top of the stretch finished well. DEPUTY OF EGBERT showed speed from the inside and had a clear lead on the turn but was caught
late. ODDS GET EVEN broke inward, chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was all out. MOCAL was bumped at the start, raced
evenly on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch had no kick. FLASH MAN was squeezed at the start and showed little while outrun. A
