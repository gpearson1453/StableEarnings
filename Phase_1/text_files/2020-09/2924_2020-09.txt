Footnotes
GASPARILLA BLAST was a step slow at the start, moved fast four wide midway on the turn, took over outside HARTS N FLOWERS with five-sixteenths
remaining, and stayed clear under a drive. TRINNI CUTIE PIE raced two to three wide around the turn within range, moved further out in the stretch and
rallied while unable to seriously threaten the winner. HARTS N FLOWERS stayed close into the turn, reached a short and brief lead past the three-eighths,
got left in the wake of GASPARILLA BLAST soon after that, and weakened in the drive. COMPETTI broke a step slow, appeared to brush the rail just past
the half-mile pole, moved to the two-path around the turn, went back inside for the last furlong and offered a mild response. BUSINESSINDUBAI was no
factor three wide. MYSTICAL CHARGE bumped with TRULY AMBITIOUS at the start, advanced mildly around the turn four wide, and could not sustain the
bid while drifting out in the lane. TRULY AMBITIOUS bumped with MYSTICAL CHARGE at the start, sped clear inside before going a quarter-mile, got
overhauled after three furlongs, and retreated. RUN SNIP RUN showed speed inside to the turn, and stopped.

MEADE pressed the pace outside ICE TEA, poked a head in front three wide past the quarter-pole, dueled outside TOWN CLASSIC through a long drive,
and prevailed narrowly. TOWN CLASSIC advanced in the two-path after a half-mile, found room to challenge for command between ICE TEA and MEADE
at the top of the stretch, battled gamely inside the latter to the finish and just missed. SAINT BENEVOLENCE raced three to four wide around the turn, and
was up for the show outside BLESSED JOURNEY near the wire. BLESSED JOURNEY saved ground at the back early, moved out three wide nearing the
stretch, and was edged for third with an even finish. ICE TEA broke sharply, was contesting the lead inside MEADE when he lunged awkwardly over a
puddle after a sixteenth of a mile, regrouped quickly and set a pressured pace, got overtaken from outside by the first two finishers leaving the turn, and
weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
ARMANDO'S TEAM was a step slow from the gate and bumped by WINTER AT BASTOGNE, began moving after six furlongs swinging out six or seven
wide, rallied on his left lead and was along in time out in the middle of the track. TONE FEELIN got pushed out by TEMPLECITYOFDOOM and bumped into
SUPER EDGAR after the start, came under a ride after five furlongs, loomed outside the leaders in upper stretch while on his left lead and attempting to lug
in, and was outfinished inside the top one. WINTER AT BASTOGNE bumped with ARMANDO'S TEAM at the break, then bumped with ELBRUS right after
that, moved through to vie for command inside RESTLESS ROCKER after a half-mile, dueled with that one around the turn and into the stretch, and drifted
out weakening a furlong out. SUPER EDGAR bumped with TONE FEELIN and steadied shortly after the start, raced four wide around the turn, ran on
willingly behind the top two finishers but needed more. ELBRUS was forced in by TEMPLECITYOFDOOM and bumped with WINTER AT BASTOGNE at
the start, came through an ample opening to loom a threat inside turning for home, but flattened out. RESTLESS ROCKER set the early pace, left the rail
open and was hooked from inside by WINTER AT BASTOGNE going to the turn, dueled to upper stretch and gave way. BORGOBYTHESEA hit the right
side of the gate at the start, showed brief speed outside, and dropped back after a half-mile. TEMPLECITYOFDOOM broke in, then came outward pushing
TONE FEELIN into SUPER EDGAR after the start, pressed the early pace, and retreated before reaching the turn.

Footnotes
BRIELLA hit the left side of the gate but was off alertly and sped to the front, showed the way in the two-path being pursued by DEM A WONDER, and had
just enough to prevail inside that rival. DEM A WONDER bumped with VENEZUELAN TALENT at the start, moved outside chasing BRIELLA around the
turn, bid through a long drive and just missed. ROMANTICAL NOTE raced four to five wide around the turn, and was along to be a distant third. I'M A
COCO PEBBLES saved ground throughout, and finished evenly. ONE NIGHT STAND broke slowly, had the six-path approaching the stretch, and could not
gain. VENEZUELAN TALENT bumped with DEM A WONDER at the start, chased the leaders three wide to the top of the stretch, and tired. CASH UP
FRONT was outrun throughout. UNDENIABLY raced three to four wide around the turn, and dropped back in the stretch. PRETTY PRINCESS was finished
early three wide. FLORESITA broke slowly, and raced far back five wide.

Footnotes
CORY GAL hopped at the start, recovered quickly and moved through between horses to grab the lead, rated along in the two-path, drifted out a bit through
the furlong grounds staying on her left lead, and was never in jeopardy. DOLL COLLECTION brushed the right side of the gate at the start, swung out five
wide late on the turn, and was up outside SONAR for the place. SONAR chased outside CORY GAL to the stretch, and lacked the needed closing
response. BACCARAT FASHION raced extremely wide throughout, and did enough to get the last major share out well past the middle of the track. FURIA
VIKINGA (CHI) faded steadily four wide after three-eighths of a mile. CHOOSE JOY tired inside through the lane on her left lead.

Footnotes
SUBTLE JOY sped to the front after the start, rated along well off the rail, came under a ride approaching the quarter-pole to fend off a challenge from
CARIBBEAN KITTEN, and responded through the stretch to maintain a daylight advantage. CARIBBEAN KITTEN moved up getting closest to SUBTLE
JOY after a half-mile, challenged from outside late on the turn, could not get by and ran on second best. NOBLE MARIA was forwardly placed early, got
outpaced by the leaders around the turn three wide, and ran on well clear of the others. STRICT VOW was widest up the backstretch, moved in around the
turn, and could not reach contention. ALL THIS JAZZ chased after the pacesetter early, was urged to keep up approaching the turn, and gave way. TELL
ME MAUX was outrun early, and dropped far back after six furlongs. OURHANDSOMEGAL was finished early, and dropped far behind.

Footnotes
SUPERHIGHWAY advanced outside after a half-mile, put in a three-wide run around the turn, took over outside ELITE MISSION approaching the
quarter-pole, drove well clear and was kept busy to the finish. TONY SMALL lagged far back for six furlongs, circled five wide into the lane, and finished well
outside. SLIPPY was never far back, overtook ELITE MISSION for second in mid stretch, but was outkicked for that spot. JANUARY WON was far back
early, moved up around the turn and into upper stretch near the three-path, and ran on evenly late. ELITE MISSION sped clear early, got collared by the
winner before completing six furlongs, and gave way inside. DR. SAMADI was well out in the track and urged up the backstretch far back, stayed very wide
and passed tired horses. COMING UP ROSES was sluggish despite urging far back for a half-mile, and made no real headway going by faders.
REVOLVING STAR was in the second flight throughout, and never factored. DEERSLAYER was finished early, and dropped well back after six furlongs.
RUSSIAN WINE chased outside the early pacesetter, and was through before reaching the stretch. NORTHBROOK dropped back six wide near the
quarter-pole. BOUND TO BE A DUKE showed speed outside up the backstretch, and stopped on the turn.

Footnotes
EL SAMURO saved ground edging closer to the leaders approaching the far turn, shifted out out three wide past the three-eighths, took over outside SIR
SEAMUS with a quick move coming to the quarter-pole, got headed from inside by CREA'S BKLYN LAW through the furlong grounds, battled back and was
going away late. CREA'S BKLYN LAW was outrun early, came rolling up the rail late on the far turn, reached a short lead in upper stretch, but could not kick
on with the top one. DONJI moved out four wide on the far turn, and could not stay with the leaders into the lane. SIR SEAMUS grabbed the lead with an
alert break, rated along removed from the rail for six furlongs, and was overhauled from both sides before reaching the stretch. SOUPER JAGUAR stumbled
badly and bumped hard with MONY at the start, recovered to pursue SIR SEAMUS from outside for six furlongs, and had nothing left after that. MONY
bumped solidly with SOUPER JAGUAR at the start and was slowest away, and dropped far back after six furlongs.

ISOLATE broke alertly and vied outside JUST RIGHT MIKE early, disposed of that one five-sixteenths out, was roused in upper stretch and expanded the
margin kept busy to the finish. PALADIO rallied outside JUST RIGHT MIKE moving into second after a half-mile, and was clearly second best. DAUNTLESS
GAL stumbled at the start, was outrun to the stretch three wide, and did enough to go clear for the show. SWAGGY GEORGE got sandwiched between MR
TINGLES and JUST RIGHT MIKE at the start, took the turn three or four wide, and tired in the drive. JUST RIGHT MIKE bumped with SWAGGY GEORGE
at the start, hustled up to press ISOLATE from inside early, and was finished after a half-mile. MR TINGLES broke out bumping hard with SWAGGY
GEORGE, and faded away two wide before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
KRAMDEN grabbed the lead after the start, rated along inside, and responded to heavy pressure to remain clear. BELLAMY'S TREASURE was slow into
stride, raced in the four-path to the stretch, rallied into second outside, and drifted out nearing the finish. CONSILIUM saved ground outrun for six furlongs,
and was up for the show in the two-path. IAMBUTTER prompted the pace two wide to the stretch, and weakened on the rail through the lane. PERFECT
ENOUGH pursued the leaders three wide to the far turn, and tired after six furlongs. IN HONOR OF ARTIE tired four wide after six furlongs. GO ABA GO
was finished after a half-mile, and jogged in far behind.
