Footnotes
VINDA MACHINE broke out at the start and was corrected but did force MADAM DEPUTY to be briefly taken hand in behind, chased four paths off the
inside down the backstretch at the tail of the field, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a near sided stick rallying to take command a furlong out, drifted out under a near sided stick and paused briefly being
straightened before drifting once more late under a near sided stick while inching away to the finish. GRAPE THERAPY brushed the near side stall at the
start, chased three then two wide before tucking briefly inside half a mile from home, tipped out to the two path near the three-eighths and advanced on the
leader under coaxing from that station, swung three to four wide for home, took over command at the three-sixteenths, dug in and was collared a furlong
out, then kept on drifting in to the rail through the final furlong under a corrective near side stick while well clear of the rest for the place honors. BUFFET
broke inwards hitting the near side stall at the start and bobbled, established the front shortly after and showed the way in hand three paths off the inside
down the backstretch under some pressure from HEY IT'S TATI to the outside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside for home under threat, dug in and was collared at the three-sixteenths, then weakened to the finish. HEY IT'S TATI stumbled at the
start when her legs appeared to slip out from under her yet broke forwardly placed despite it, prompted the leader from the five path down the backstretch
and then three wide through the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch in retreat and weakened in the stretch. MADAM DEPUTY briefly steadied at the
start as VINDA MACHINE broke outwards, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under prolonged
coaxing from the half mile pole, went eight wide into upper stretch and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
NASHVILLE was hustled to the lead, angled in while showing good speed outside of two foes outside the five-eighths pole and put SOUTHERNER in tight
then moved clear, extended the advantage in the two path on the turn, was roused in the three path into upper stretch, powered away under a strong hand
ride into the final furlong, was given one light crack of a right-handed whip shortly thereafter then was geared down while much the best. DEMOCRATIC
VALUES was hard ridden while showing speed then chased the pace, switched outside of the leader around the nine-sixteenths, raced inside to the two
path under a vigorous drive early on the turn, came under the whip outside the five-sixteenths, moved to the three path outside the quarter-pole then drifted
five wide into upper stretch under a left-handed whip, was switched to a right-handed whip in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths and safely secured the place
while completely no match for the winner. BREITHORN was urged along on the outside, jostled with a foe outside the half-mile pole, went three to four wide
for most of the turn, dropped to the two path under a drive outside the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch under the whip and came up empty while clear for
third. SOUTHERNER was hustled from the start, showed speed between horses, was carried in outside the five-eighths pole then dropped back while
steadied briefly in tight on heels, jostled with BREITHORN late on the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn, floated five wide into upper stretch
and capitulated.

REJECTED AGAIN established control in short order, showed the way on an open lead, spaced at a slight distance from off the inside route, sputtered three
wide when put to a ride entering the stretch, left the eighth pole still in possession of a healthy advantage, saw the pilot utilize the whip from the right side
getting worked over to the rail in the final furlong, held safe. BAD GUY made it over to the rail by the conclusion of the backstretch, was put to
encouragement taking up the chase on the turn, cut the corner into the lane, narrowed in on winner in a steadfast manner in the last eighth, tipped out late,
came up short. MALTHAEL angled sharply over to the rail at the half mile pole, rode it to the end of the bend, got sent out five wide for the stretch run,
displayed some late energy securing the show. TWELFTH LABOUR stalked the top one two to three wide on the turn, swung out into path four stepping
onto the head of the stretch, flattened out. PEPPER PIKE took the inside route, rode the rail turning for home, closed while making no impact.
BOBBYFROMTHEPALM sluggish after getting pinched in the shadow of the starting gate, pursued the pace from the two path, went into the lane, never
made his presence felt. CAUSE OF ACTION hustled on the chute, chased the leader two to three wide on the turn, was more the latter spinning into the
stretch, gave way. CASTLE CASANOVA strung out four wide on the turn, got fanned out six wide for the drive, venturing onward as the widest of all, tired.
MR. SHORTANDSIMPLE two wide onto the turn, was in path four exiting it, folded.

from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive holding well and safe to the finish kept
to task. BRUNATE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home, ran on to chase the winner
home well clear of the rest to be along clearly second best. RINGGOOD chased just off the inside until briefly tucked inside half a mile from home, tipped to
the two path at the three-eighths put to a drive, continued just off the inside for home and weakened while along for the show honors. TALESPIN chased
four to five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, went five wide into upper stretch, tired. BOSTON BILLY chased two to three wide under a ride from the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. LORENZEN chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home,
got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. GRATTO SWING chased two to three wide and was briefly
in tight between foes when placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside for home and tired. HAVE A HEART brushed the off side stall
at the start when lunging slightly, chased five to six wide under a ride from the three-eighths, continued in the overland route into upper stretch and made no
impact.

Footnotes
CITY TEMPER pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, took the lead in the four path
while still on his inside lead into upper stretch, battled outside of the runner-up under a right-handed whip, brushed with that foe then swapped to the proper
lead outside the sixteenth-pole, was switched to a left-handed whip shortly thereafter, drifted out under a continued left-handed whip late and just held under
strong urging. DOLL broke out then was hustled while corrected, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, passed the
five-sixteenths under a strong hand ride, lost the advantage under a right-handed whip into upper stretch, switched to a left-handed whip at the eighth-pole,
fought back gamely inside of the winner in the final furlong, brushed with that foe outside the sixteenth-pole, drifted out late and just missed while able to get
the place. QUASAR bumped lightly with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch,
found his best stride in the final furlong and finished with good energy to get the show. STUNNING MUNNINGS bumped lightly with a rival at the start and
was off a half-step slow, chased the pace down the backstretch, moved out into the turn, pursued the leading duo in the four path on that bend, spun five
wide into the stretch then came under the whip, chased the top two in the drive and was out-kicked then lost the show. SHANNON'S GIRL was urged along
at the rear of the field, went around the turn in the two path then was driven three wide into the stretch and gained ground but failed to threaten. MISS
CHARISMA broke a step slow, settled on the outside under some urging, went five wide on the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch under a drive and
lacked the needed response. TOUCH OF NIRVANA was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved
ground on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond.

Footnotes
UNRIGHTEOUS away well, underwent a three wide pursuit, flashed interest springing from the half mile pole, chipped away at the deficit, loomed boldly
entering the stretch, shifted inward to give a better view of the nemesis as a spirited tussle between them ignited, saw the twosome either leaning on or
brushing into each other down the lane, gamely got the job done. WILLING TO SPEED assumed the role of primary pursuer, was held in reserve prompting
BLUEGRASS PARKWAY from path two, displaced that opponent in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths marker, had no soon done so when UNRIGHTEOUS
took aim, vied with vigour matched up with that foe beginning from the head of the stretch, had the pair exchange either leans or brushes during their heated
battle, proved stubborn to the end but had to settle for the place. BLUEGRASS PARKWAY broke on top, cemented himself to the lead after an abbreviated
brisk hand ride, cut over to the rail, showed the way, tailed by the second place finisher to its outside, got asked for more in the process of being replaced on
the front end at the five-sixteenths pole, stepped into the lane, angled three wide, gave way. COWTOWN sluggish out of the starting gate, chased the pace
at or near the inside until the conclusion of the backstretch, got maneuvered three wide at the top of the far turn, was roused a furlong later, failed to gain,
wandered five wide into the lane, continued to lose ground.

EVALUATOR along the inside through the first turn, chased just off the inside down the backstretch, tipped out four wide through the far turn coming under
coaxing near the five-sixteenths, continued four wide for home, rallied to take command and went clear under a drive getting geared down in the late stages,
the outcome in no doubt. OUR LAST BUCK three wide through the first turn, dueled five then four wide down the backstretch with FREAKY STYLEY to his
inside widening away from the rest, tucked three wide through the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch
having shaken off his main pace rival confronted by the aforementioned foe, yielded the front straightened away and weakened in the late stages while clear
for the place honors. CONTROL GROUP coaxed from the gate, went three wide through the first turn, chased three wide down the backstretch and then five
wide through the far turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE four wide
through the opening bend, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the far turn under coaxing from three furlongs
out, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. FREAKY STYLEY just off the inside through the first turn, dueled from the four path with OUR
LAST BUCK to his outside widening away from the rest, came under coaxing tucked two to three wide at the seven-sixteenths, succumbed the front near
the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch in retreat and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
FIRE AT WILL broke a half-step slow, dropped well behind early then angled in, saved ground on the turn, rallied passing the five-sixteenths, closed fast
while cutting the corner into the stretch, made a bid inside of the runner-up at the three-sixteenths, took the lead while off the rail outside the furlong marker,
battled with that foe under a right-handed whip to the wire and prevailed under strong urging. BLAME THE BOOZE came outward at the start, showed the
way through solid fractions, rounded the turn in the two path, was given his cue inside the five-sixteenths, came under a right-handed whip just after turning
into the stretch while challenged by the winner, battled outside that foe into the final furlong, switched to a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole and
missed while well clear for the place. ZIPPY BABY came outward a bit at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn,
shied out when put to a left-handed whip outside the quarter-pole, spun four wide into the stretch, pursued the top two under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened but was clear for third. WINFROMWITHIN broke a half-step slow, settled on the outside under some urging, chased in the four path on the turn,
floated six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DIANNESIMPAZIBLE away without apparent mishap, took up residence in midpack, slid onto the inside route at the top of the turn, kept watch on the front
runners sparring for command, got sent out five wide for the drive home, kicked into stride and closed in on the ones to catch, wore down MONEY IN THE
BANK in deep stretch and edged away. MONEY IN THE BANK powered his way into a forward position after the field had been sent off and running,
emerged with the advantage after an abbreviated skirmish that involved three others to its outside, was once more forced to defend the front end as the
innermost of a group of four by the top of the bend, going about the chore while pulling a bit on the bit from the left, got hooked up a duel with PIER FORTY
shortly after the half had been rattled off, shifted into the two path turning into the stretch still locked in combat with the aforementioned foe, staved off the
pesky PIER FORTY over the course of the next furlong, saw the winner begin to gain ground in a steadfast, relinquished reluctantly a few jumps shy of the
finish line. PIER FORTY at a considerable distance from off the inside throughout, hitched up to the front runners departing the backstretch, contended as
the widest of four until about midpoint on the turn, went at it one on one with MONEY IN THE BANK afterwards, mustered up a stiff bid until midstretch,
stayed on to secure third. TRUE PALACE pursued the pace from the four path during the run around the bend, arrived at the quarter pole, wandered out
eight to nine wide from upper to midlane, gained some real estate. K. K. ICHIKAWA chased the pace two wide on the turn, got ridden towards path five in
upper stretch, lacked the necessary response. NIGHTSPOT an early contender for the advantage, dove into the pocket in the general area of the half mile
pole, cut the corner into the stretch and faltered. BRICKYARD was moved into path three on the backstretch, was one of the middle members of a foursome
arguing for control for a good portion of the trip on the turn, stepped into the stretch and backed away, then had the pilot lose the whip in the shadow of the
wire. SELFMADE corrected after breaking slightly to the outside, attained a prominent position, fought for the top during the initial stages, then did so again
after leaving the backstretch in the two path, undergoing the task from between rivals in each instance, swung into the lane and gave way. JACK RUSSEL
hustled from the gate to secure a spot in midpack, stepped onto the turn from the two path, was through after going a half.
