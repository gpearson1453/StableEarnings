FAITH FACTOR never far back, looped to a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off
late. THE TWO NANCY'S tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside the leader into the stretch, gained a short lead, then was
no match for the winner and held the place safe. TAPPING THE KITTY allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane,
then lugged in and edged up for the show. MALARKEY well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid between rivals into the
stretch and weakened the final furlong. EMERALD CITADELLE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then
faded in the lane. BEACH PRINCESS mid pack, faded after half. HONEST GINGER was no factor. MY LITTLE STORMY ran evenly for a half, fanned
widest into the lane and had no rally.

edged up in the final strides. MAD JACK allowed to settle, looped to a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane,
made a steady gain and was outfinished. ECHOES OF THUNDER tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader

DANA'S BEAUTY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off in the lane, then lasted under steady pressure. DO YOU LOVE ME tracked the pace,
saved ground through the turn on the two path, bid outside the leader into the lane, made a steady gain and missed. SOUTH HOUSE well placed, held
position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, angled in, made a steady gain and edged up for the show. FAST LANI rated inside,
raced boxed on the two path through the turn, came through on that path, angled out and evened out in the lane. ROSSENARRA allowed to settle, rushed
up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and flattened out. BOURBON BLAST mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came
through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened in the drive. CLEARLY SMASHING allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn,
fanned widest into the lane and ran evenly. GIRLINTHEFIREPLACE allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the
lane and could not gain. SQUAD UP was no factor. AMARI S. well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, then had no rally.
