tired. AWESOME SIGHT was wide and outrun. LIME HOUSE LOUIE was outrun in the three path and finished in a dead heat for fifth. VICKSBURG
BLUFFS showed speed outside, raced the four path around the turn then tired and finished even for last.

Footnotes
MASTERFUL TOUCH was rated behind the first flight, rallied quickly along the rail early on the far turn, ran clear after six furlongs and widened under mild
urging. CRUISE CONTROL was bumped into MASTERFUL TOUCH when bumped and put in tight leaving the gate, settled early, stayed along the rail
around the final turn and was second best. E T'S WARRIOR ducked in sharply leaving the gate, moved clear soon after, made the pace in the two path for
about three-quarters then stopped. WEE ARCH chased the early leader in the three path, moved between horses to press that one before a half, remained
lapped on that one in the three path around the final turn and stopped. CHANGE THE IMAGE was wide and no factor. LITHOGRAPHER, fractious in the
gate, was bumped and forced into CRUISE CONTROL at the break, raced wide around the first turn, remained prominent to the far turn then stopped. There
was a stewards' inquiry into the break but the results stood.

Footnotes
TRIBAL PRINCESS moved to the front before going a furlong, edged clear in the two path before a half, bore out sharply under left hand whip entering the
final furlong, impeded TARA'S Z VA and held. Following an inquiry and objection by Lloyd, TRIBAL PRINCESS was disqualified and placed third. MICRO
BLAST was slow early, raced the four path around the turn and finished fastest outside. TARA'S Z VA was bumped leaving the gate, wasn't far back inside
early, came out into the four path on the turn, checked entering the final furlong and lost best chance. STICK UP ducked out into TARA'S Z VA leaving the
gate, gained striking position along the rail but lacked the needed rally. J R SUPERSTAR pressed in the three path outside the leader, gave her best into the
final furlong then flattened out. WAIKIKI raced between rivals with the pace to the turn then stopped. MISS SVENGAIL fell back quickly from between rivals
and was outrun. HAPPYANDIKNOWIT suffered a catastrophic injury entering the stretch, fell and was humanely euthanized.

CRAIGGER showed speed from the outset, moved clear midway on the backstretch, stayed out from the rail around the turn and held under urging.
COPPERHEAD CREEK fell back leaving the gate, raced the two path around the turn and finished fast inside. JUST GOT HITCHED was slow from the
gate, advanced inside, came out for the drive and closed fast outside. NEGATIVE NICKY raced the three path and failed to matter. TRIPLE A. PLUS came
over in front of EYE OF GUNFIGHTER early on the backstretch, causing that one to clip heels, steadied soon after, bore out, bore out on the turn and
stopped. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER clipped heels and stumbled early on the backstretch then was outrun.
