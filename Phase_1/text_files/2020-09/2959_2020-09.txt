Footnotes
MATERS N TATERS was away alertly to set an uncontested pace, drew off on the turn then held sway late while tiring to prove best under a drive.
SHADOW OF JUSTICE was allowed to settle early on the inside, eased out four wide past the quarter pole to commence a rally, then came in to the stretch
five wide to close well. ORIENT MAGIC was bumped shortly after the start, then stalked the pace from the inside, continued toward the inside but lacked the
needed winning bid while besting the rest. A LITTLE IRRADIC was reserved early, came in to the stretch five wide to offer a mild late rally. KING JUSTICE
was void of early speed while saving ground, then offered a belated rally on the inside. BIG FUDGE tracked the early pace while three wide and in between
rivals then was empty. BARRIER stumbled at the start, then tracked the pace four wide before stopping.

Footnotes
BOYFRIEND MATERIAL was well placed early and made a inside bid leaving the quarter pole, went on even terms past the eighth pole then edge clear late
to prove best, driving. HIDDEN RULER set the pace while racing off the rail, dug in gamely in the stretch but could not hold off the winner while saving the
place. BYBEE chased the early pace five wide, then made a four wide bid on the turn to move into contention, continued to gain late but needed more.
HURRICANE HIGHWAY was slow into stride and was far back early, then closed well on the inside late for minor awards. SUPER SOL stalked the early
pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but flattened out in the drive. BETTER WATCH OUT chased the early pace and made a mild four wide bid on
the turn but was empty in the drive. RAGTIME BLUES was off a step slow, then raced five wide past the quarter pole while no threat. RED HOT DEVIL was
well placed early in between horses then tired.

Footnotes
PRINCESS LILLI BUG was sent to the lead and drew clear on the turn, then drew off smartly to prove much the best while being kept to mild pressure.
SUPER CAT LADY stalked the winner three wide early, then proved to be no match for the rival while clearly second best. HOUSE DRUNK was reserved
early, advanced and came into the stretch five wide, bested rest. PRECIOUS ARCH chased the early pace on the inside then weakened. RUNAWAY
DREAM stalked the early pace four wide, then raced three wide by the quarter pole, empty. MISS PRISSY PANTS broke outward at the start, failed to
menace. PURE AIR HAVANA was not a threat. O LUCKY DAY was through early.
