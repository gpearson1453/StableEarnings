WEDNESDAY settled while three wide, advanced on the far turn and finished well while four wide in the stretch. IN THE GAP raced forwardly while three
wide, moved closer on the far turn and stayed on well in the stretch. THAT'S WHAT I SAY outrun early, closed ground on the far turn and lodged a mild four
wide bid in the stretch. CHOOS UR ADVENTURE grabbed the early lead, set a demanding pace and was worn down late. PEPE' LONGSTOCKING never
menaced. COMEGETSOME stalked the pace and weakened.
