Footnotes
MACHTREE well placed behind the dueling leaders, angled out advancing near the quarter pole and drew clear under a drive. ECLIPSED MOON broke
sluggishly and raced far back then closed a big gap along the inside. NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ broke awkwardly and to the right, chased outside and offered only
a mild rally. WOODBURY dueled in the two path, led briefly on the final turn and weakened. IMPACTFUL dueled along the rail with a narrow lead and
stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
GOLD RUSH KIZZIE ducked in and hit the inner rail entering the first turn, saved ground, split foes then went three wide on the final turn, drifted in slightly
near mid stretch and held on. HOME BY SEVEN broke slowly, saved ground, waited for racing room on the final turn, angled out in stretch and closed for
place. AFRICAN SONG eased out three wide backstretch, took the lead far turn, was between foes into stretch, drifted in and steadied entering the gap and
held on gamely. MEGALOMANIA saved ground disputing the pace but then weakened late. TIBERIAN EMPRESS vied for command two wide and then fell
back. SHES EUPHORIC broke slowly, raced very wide and failed to menace. PASATIME came in after start then was steadied soon after, steadied again
and lost action entering the first turn. SMARTY SOCKS broke slowly, saved ground and failed to menace. START NOTIZING steadied when PASATIME
came in after the start, was far back. The rider of African Song lodged a claim of foul against GOLD RUSH KIZZIE for interference in the stretch but it was
dismissed. The stewards also lite the inquiry sign but took no action.

Footnotes
ARRECIFE lagged far behind early, rallied strongly along the inside and was up in the final yards in a much improved showing. YOUR AWESOME BOSS
pursued the loose pacesetter, took over into the stretch, bid clear but was nailed. MY DANZIG PARTNER chased inside early, moved wide in the stretch
and flattened out. RAGGY ROCKS chased off the pace and continued willingly while no threat. SON OF DARKNESS quickly sprinted clear inside, was
collared into the stretch and tired. YONDERING dropped back wide and was never in contention. START MEEE raced outside and lacked a rally.
AMERICAN RIVER (VEN) was urged off the leaders three wide and began fading on the turn.

SWEET TURN set pace just off pace under rating, shook loose and opened a long lead mid stretch and then lasted. SCATNAP, just off the rail and just off
the pace, eased out through stretch and closed. WINGS OF FURY dueled for command between foes but then weakened late. WHITNEY COVE saved
ground, drifted out mid stretch and had no rally. TERPEYE, two wide, was carried out a bit stretch and failed to menace. NEVISIAN SUNSET, three wide
dueling for the early lead then tired. ANISSA showed little.

FACTOR THIS IN chased just off the pace outside, moved inside on the turn, came out in the stretch, moved clear briefly and outdueled several rivals to get
up in a long drive. FIRE MISSION settled outside, rallied wide in the stretch, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. OWIN I AM dropped far
behind, split rivals in the stretch rallying but was outfinished. ARTISTIC DRIFTER saved ground within striking range and continued willingly. HONORABLE
SERVICE chased outside, was very wide on the turn and into the stretch rallying. EMPEROR JOHN trailed for half a mile, bid wide on the turn, angled
inside advancing through the stretch. ROL AGAIN QUESTION prompted the pace wide down the backstretch then steadied tiring in mid-stretch. FOR THE
ROAD set a clear pace, widened on the turn but stopped in the final furlong.

GALILEO'S AFFAIR was outrun racing wide, moved closer to rail on the final turn then swung out again, quickly took command deep stretch and drew away
fully extended. JUMPIN JETT set the pace inside, was clear mid stretch, drifted out and was no match. DRIVEN BY SPEED challenged three wide on the
backstretch but then faded late. SILVER EXCESS prompted the pace two wide and weakened. FINISHING SCHOOL broke slowly, moved up to save
ground just off the pace then tired. CHORITE broke slowest, moved out wide on the final turn and was no factor. BIG RED SEVEN raced wide and dropped
back steadily. SYDNEY TIME was just off the rail and showed little. PRETTY COOL CAT saved ground and failed to menace. SHE MAKES ME SMILE,
racing in the four path while just off the pace, stopped. KENDYL ELIZABETH stopped suddenly and lost contact.

angled out in the stretch and closed well too late. HAZ A NOTION bid inside after half a mile, loomed a threat but flattened out. MARKET BUBBLE lagged
far behind, moved very wide into the stretch closing the gap. GILDED WARRIOR dropped far behind then passed rivals late without menacing.
JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF set a clear pace to the stretch and came up empty. WHERE YOU WAS urged close up in the two path then faded on the final turn.
HIZAAM chased very wide and gave way through the stretch. FREE DANCER raced close up inside briefly then stopped into the far turn. SMART AND
