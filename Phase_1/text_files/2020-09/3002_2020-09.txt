Footnotes
EL PILLO broke alertly and crossed over inside with the lead, rated along to the stretch and widened under pressure unthreatened. JOE BENJAMIN
prompted the pace outside the winner all the way, moved inside for the drive, and dug in along the rail to hold second. CROI MOR lacked room along the
inside heading into the first turn, waited for clearance midway on the far turn, came off the rail with aim in the two-path at the top of the lane, and was
outfinished for the place. TANK 'EM DOWN brushed with VASZAR ACADEMY at the start, settled in the two-path most of the way, and was no menace
through an even effort. ROBIN TEAM SHOW went along in the second flight, swung three wide after six furlongs, and could not gain. SULEMAN tracked
outside the leaders three wide to the far turn, and was empty when roused. VASZAR ACADEMY brushed with TANK 'EM DOWN at the start, and dropped
back early. ABRUPT was always outrun. GEORGIA PINES was outrun early inside, and showed little. CORCEL hesitated a stride out of the gate at a cost
of about five lengths, and never made contact with the field despite urging.

Footnotes
OSPREY broke out brushing HARLAN'S STYLE, sped clear early inside, was put to a drive five-sixteenths out, and stayed in command all out. GEGE
CONQUEST bumped with GLOBALTROUBLECOCO at the start, raced forwardly inside early, came off the rail for the drive and went clear for the place
without threatening the winner. ROYAL MEETING broke out bumping SOLD AMERICAN, pursued the winner from outside to the stretch, and was
outfinished for second. COLTONSTHEADMIRAL broke awkwardly to the inside spotting the field several lengths, swung five wide with a mild rally into upper
stretch, and ran on evenly. GLOBALTROUBLECOCO bumped with GEGE CONQUEST at the start, and posed no threat. SOLD AMERICAN was bumped
by ROYAL MEETING at the start, chased outside for three-eighths of a mile, and tired. HARLAN'S STYLE brushed with OSPREY at the start, was
outsprinted early despite hustling tactics, dropped far back in the stretch, pulled up in distress after the finish and was vanned off.

Footnotes
NAPA RULES broke to a clear lead but deferred to BLOSSOM BOW, followed from a distance to the far turn, was put to a drive before completing six
furlongs, caught the spent pacesetter from outside through the furlong grounds and drew away under pressure. PERT was off two or three lengths behind
the next-to-last horse, raced far back for six furlongs, came three wide for the drive and rallied to go clear for the place. BLOSSOM BOW sped off to a
lengthy lead through ambitious fractions, grew leg weary through upper stretch and had enough to salvage the show. ALL ABOUT KATHERN raced in the
two-path on the turns, and failed to factor. QUEEN FIELD fought rating early, checked sharply along the rail behind MISS MY MACHO entering the far turn,
and could not gain. MISS MY MACHO chased the leader from a distance, moved in entering the far turn, and tired. INTEREST was never in the hunt.

Footnotes
DIAL A LADY was outrun early, came three wide finding her best stride off the turn, caught CRYSTAL SKY from outside in deep stretch and drew clear.
CRYSTAL SKY tracked outside the leaders three wide, was under a drive by late on the turn, reached the front outside NAG NAG NAG in upper stretch,
had the rider lose the whip while being overtaken a sixteenth out, and was clear of the others. NAG NAG NAG vied for command outside CANTAORA for a
half-mile, got the best of that battle turning for home, but weakened inside the top two finishers. C'EST PARTI raced four wide around the turn, offered a
mild response and just missed outside NAG NAG NAG for the show. SPIN CLASS was no threat two to three wide. PEDESTAL bumped with CANTAORA
at the start, and was outrun inside. CANTAORA bumped with PEDESTAL at the start, dueled inside NAG NAG NAG for a half-mile, and gave way. PALACE
GIRL raced close up inside early, and was through after a half-mile. LA MAMA CHULA was no factor three wide. NEW DELHI suffered a catastrophic injury
to the left front near the nine-sixteenths pole, fell heavily unseating the rider and was vanned off.

KATIELEIGH broke alertly and vied for command inside STORMY NELLY and CATCH A THRILL, shook clear turning for home and held sway under a
drive. CATCH A THRILL pressed the pace outside rivals three wide, and ran on willingly to be clearly second best. MERSEYSIDE broke out bumping
BIBIANA at the start, sat behind the leading trio around the turn, moved out to the three-path in the stretch and finished evenly. THE AURELIA FACTOR
failed to menace three wide. STORMY NELLY argued the pace between horses, and tired after three furlongs. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN broke outward
coming away behind the field, and was outrun inside. MAJIC FLASH was no factor inside. FUDDLED (IRE) was outrun throughout. BIBIANA got bumped by
MERSEYSIDE at the start and was off slowly, and remained in arrears.

Footnotes
QUEEN DOMINA pressed the early pace three wide, took over around the turn and pulled clear, and drifted out in the stretch clearly best. YES IT'S FREE
became unsettled behind the gate, trailed for a half-mile, came five wide off the turn, moved in rallying through the lane and went clear for the place. LOVE
IN HER EYES bumped with SHINY EMPIRE at the start, moved out to the three-path around the turn, and lacked a solid bid toward the inside. SHINY
EMPIRE bumped with LOVE IN HER EYES at the start, was urged widest up the backstretch, rallied past rivals four wide around the turn, drifted out in
upper stretch and weakened. CHARGE IT ALL led early but was soon joined from both flanks, went into the turn battling between horses, and was finished
before reaching the stretch. VIVI'S DREAM'S went up inside to grab the lead away from CHARGE IT ALL up the backstretch, and dropped back through the
latter part of the turn.

Footnotes
SUGAR BOLT set a pressured pace inside, shook off ALPILLES coming off the turn, and was driving to remain clear. TAKE THE OVER saved ground
outsprinted early, stayed inside for the drive and finished well to narrow the gap. BEATING THE ODDS raced in the second flight three wide early, rallied
between horses in the stretch and ran on willingly. MS BIG SPRING stayed in range early, had the three-path into the lane, and could not gain. BAHAMIAN
GIRL was no threat four wide. ALPILLES pressed the winner from outside for three furlongs, and weakened in upper stretch. ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA was
no factor two wide. FAST VENEZUELA briefly loomed a threat three wide near the quarter-pole, but gave way from there. MISS DAWN was far back
throughout. WISHFULLY wandered out after the break, and was outrun four wide.

ICONIC bumped lightly with MONMOUTH DR at the start, came under heavy pressure entering the main track in the second flight, remained under a drive
advancing five wide after six furlongs, collared TIPSY KITTEN from outside past the eighth-pole and drew clear. LI'L MEATBALL improved around the turn
in the two-path, moved out through the furlong grounds and rallied to go clear for the place. TIPSY KITTEN bumped lightly with MONMOUTH DR at the
start, vied up front between horses early, gained command after six furlongs, could not hold off the winner entering the final furlong and weakened inside.
MILLIONAIRE RUNNER raced two to three wide around the turn, and offered a mild response to pick up the last major share. KAHRAMANI was outrun for
six furlongs, came six wide into the lane, gained mildly, and was vanned off after the finish. MONMOUTH DR was jostled lightly between TIPSY KITTEN
and ICONIC at the start, pressed the pace three wide, and faded before completing six furlongs. OX TROT set a pressured pace inside, and was through
after six furlongs. TWO STEP SLEW raced in the two-path on the turn, and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
AUNT IRENE stayed close early inside, got through on the rail to join the leaders turning for home, dueled through the lane inside OUR LITTLE DEVIL and
proved best late. OUR LITTLE DEVIL bumped with QUEEN LETIZIA at the start, raced forwardly three wide into the turn, poked a head in front outside
TWINKIESANDTURNIPS in upper stretch, jumped back to her left lead battling outside AUNT IRENE late, and was edged to the finish. FLAT OUT COOL
raced three then four wide around the turn, and finished evenly. TWINKIESANDTURNIPS set the pace inside for three furlongs, and weakened through the
lane. GRAVEL GERTIE chased between horses from close range around the turn, and faded in the stretch. SCAMPER ALONG saved ground to no avail.
RENEESINHEAVEN steadied between SCAMPER ALONG and CLARIST a stride from the gate, raced far back early, and improved position without
threatening. QUEEN LETIZIA bumped with OUR LITTLE DEVIL at the start, and was outrun. BEND THE KNEE came under a ride four wide around the
turn, and lacked a response. CLARIST was finished early. FIRST TIMER dropped far back after a quarter-mile. SLEW CAT SLEW was never prominent.
