Footnotes
FRIENDLY OUTTHEDOR was content to trail to the second turn, bid two wide then swung out four deep into the stretch, rallied when set down and closed
determinedly to prevail. FRAVEL was unhurried to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then finished willingly inside rivals to the line. OASIS was
chasing the leader for six furlongs while saving ground, shifted out in upper stretch then stayed on but was outfinished. RAWHIDE RAWLINS set the pace
three wide to the backstretch, edged away to the second turn, was off the rail and responded to mid stretch but was tiring late. MY LUCKY BID was rank
and throwing his head in the chute and continued rank to the first turn, settled on the backstretch, was three wide then swung out widest for the drive but
finished evenly late. PARADISE FOREVER stalked the pace to the half, was two wide on the second turn but also tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
VRONILLA PARFAIT never far back to the turn, shifted off the rail and was two wide to the stretch, rallied to the front leaving mid stretch and held
stubbornly. TIZZY was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then shifted out for room in mid stretch and closed willingly. MEET MISS KITTY
had no speed, trailed to the turn, had to swing out five deep into the stretch but finished in a mild rally. OUR BOLD PRINCESS got outrun to the turn, was
two wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch but came on late. SWEETLY SPOKEN broke alertly and was quickly in front, set the pace from the
rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch but was tiring in the latter stages. HEATSEEKER BABY stalked the pace early, got pushed out four deep on the
turn then was outkicked to mid stretch and lacked a closing response. PROMOTE (IRE) pressed SWEETLY SPOKEN two then three wide to the stretch but
gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SHE'S GOT HEART had good speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, edged away to mid stretch and held determinedly. CONNIE'S PROMISE was
chasing to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task and was gaining late. TSUNAMI SPRING was outsprinted
early, raced three wide on the turn then shifted out, rallied between rivals leaving the furlong ground and finished willingly. DEE GEE also chased the winner
to the turn, bid four wide to the stretch but could not sustain the needed response. TRULY FABULOUS broke a bit slow, had no speed and was not a factor.
MOON OVER MAG BAY pressed the winner from the rail to mid turn then was outrun to the stretch and gave way.
