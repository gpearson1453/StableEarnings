Footnotes
MOJO MAN dueled two wide, took over from the three sixteenths, cleared midstretch despite drifting out, and held safe. DABO settled in second last, was
pushed along to improve from near the three eighths and took closer order in the two to three path, swung out from room approaching the five sixteenths,
came three wide into the lane, rallied four wide and gained to the wire. DEVILEYE trailed early, took closer order while saving ground on the turn, came into
the lane under a drive behind a line of horses, split foes at the three sixteenths, rallied inside but was outfinished for the place. CINCO STAR chased the
leading pair two wide down the backstretch, tracked them in the three path on the turn, came into the lane under a drive between horses, could not get to
the leaders, and proved no match for the closers while racing three and then two wide in the lane. RICHIESINTHEHOUSE dueled inside of MOJO MAN
while racing keenly, was outpaced by that foe from the three sixteenths, and weakened between horses. SMART REMARK chased the leading pair inside of
CINCO STAR early, was pushed along while saving ground on the turn, went to a drive inside in upper stretch and had no response.

Footnotes
BIARRITZ dueled for the lead on the inside early, led the field from the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was kept to the task to
the wire. CHARLIECANDO stalked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, angled out entering the stretch to chase the
eventual winner on the outside and had to settle for second best. MEDAL OF FACT chased the frontrunners on the outside in the opening stages, raced in
the four path around the turn, began an outside bid nearing the quarter pole and finished evenly in the stretch while not threatening the top two. COMING
UP ACES brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was
outkicked on the rail in late stretch. PFLASH OF RED raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the turn, gained a bit of ground in late
stretch, was pulled up on the gallop out, walked soundly off the turf course and was vanned off in a seemingly precautionary move. WAVE'NDUMONI
brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to improve position around the turn, entered the stretch from
the three path and flattened out from there. SMART TRIAL raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and
made no bid. MY PAL JAC dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to press the pace from the three path around the turn and tired
badly in the final furlong.

Footnotes
KENAI COOL settled toward the rear inside of AMERICAN BIZ early, chased in the two path on the turn, rallied in the two path under a drive into the lane,
continued to improve two to three wide through horses, took the lead three wide in the final fifty yards and held. DON'T HOLD QUEENS showed no early
speed, took closer order in the two path approaching the turn for home, joined the rear of the main pack in upper stretch, came flying three to four wide in
the final furlong, and just missed. HELEN MAE'S SONG tracked the leader between horses early, stalked in the three path on the turn, engaged outside of
CASE CRACKER approaching the quarter, loomed outside of her, took the lead with a furlong to go, but flattened out late and was caught in the final fifty
yards. CASE CRACKER was hustled to the lead, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, was engaged by HELEN MAE'S SONG to her outside
approaching the quarter pole, kept on under a drive in upper stretch but ceded the lead at the eighth pole and weakened inside. AMERICAN BIZ settled
toward the rear two wide early, chased in the two to three path on the turn, was driven two wide into the stretch, chased on mildly and narrowly missed
fourth. DANCE chased while saving ground, was driven into the lane from the inside while in range of CASE CRACKER, proved no match for the leading
pair, and flattened out in the final furlong. HER WILD LIFESTYLE broke awkwardly and was slow into stride, settled near the rear inside of VALIANT LADY,
raced in the three path at the rear of the main pack through the turn and into the stretch, and passed tired horses under a drive inside. DEAUVILLE MIST
tracked four wide between horses on the backstretch, chased the leading pair three wide on the turn, came into the lane four wide under a drive but proved
empty. BIT MONEY chased three wide between horses early, raced midfield between horses around the turn and into the lane, and had no response under
light urging to midstretch. VALIANT LADY settled near the rear two wide early, continued toward the rear in the six path on the turn and into the stretch, was
driven in upper stretch and had no rally. LADY WARRIOR chased five wide early, continued four wide on the turn, floated into the lane in the nine to ten
path and came up empty.

Footnotes
GRANDAL bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field up the backstretch, dueled for the lead while saving ground
around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held the advantage to the wire. LIBERAL LUNACY bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the
gate, raced off the pace on the inside early, navigated the turn from the three path and gained ground quickly on the outside in late stretch. ARBA chased
the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path approaching the three eighths pole, improved position in the stretch and was
caught for the place late. TAKE ME UP BRADY tracked the frontrunners on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the
two path and finished evenly. GLACKEN'S GHOST raced between horses in the middle of the pack in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn
and was outkicked in the final furlong. SUPERMANS CAPE was bumped by the horses to either side of him at the break, trailed the field up the backstretch,
raced in the two path around the turn and gained some ground in late stretch. CUESTION DE TIEMPO raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early,
navigated the turn from the three path, made a move approaching the quarter pole and flattened out in the stretch. AIR FORCE JET (GB) raced off the pace
on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and was never a threat. AMERICAN HERITAGE raced in the middle of the pack on
the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and faded in the stretch. ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS dueled for the lead on the outside through
the opening three eighths of a mile, raced in the two path around turn, and tired badly in the final furlong.

with a sixteenth of a mile to go and won clear. RIVER EVANGELIST was bumped by MIRACLE MOUNTAIN in the opening strides, settled toward the rear,
raced two wide into the clubhouse turn, bid four wide into the backstretch and improved to midpack, advanced further to track the leading pair into the far
turn, bid outside the leading pair into upper stretch, was bumped by BUNSTER near the sixteenth, kept on but could not get to the winner. BUNSTER was
bumped in the opening strides, tracked pacesetter CROW MOON inside of CADET CAPTAIN through the first turn, continued in range down the
backstretch, engaged outside of CROW MOON past the half, vied outside of that foe around the turn and into the lane, was caught by MIRACLE
MOUNTAIN near the sixteenth and also bumped by RIVER EVANGELIST, and flattened late. CROW MOON cleared to the lead, was confronted by
BUNSTER past the half mile mark, vied inside that foe around the turn and into upper stretch, and weakened inside late. PRINCE ARLO chased inside of
SUMMER CASTLE through the far turn and down the backstretch, inched forward and raced at the inside of the tracking flight through the far turn, was
boxed in behind the leading flight and inside of RIVER EVANGELIST in upper stretch, and was outkicked to the finish. SUMMER CASTLE broke outward,
was bumped by BUNSTER after the first few strides as a result of CADET CAPTAIN coming inward, chased two wide through the clubhouse turn and
between horses down the backstretch, kept on midfield inside of MIRACLE MOUNTAIN around the far turn, and chased on evenly inside in the lane. UNO

ultimately no threat. ANDREAS was shut off between horses in the opening strides, settled at the rear, continued in the back flight while saving ground
trough the far turn, and passed tiring horses in the lane. CADET CAPTAIN came inward in the opening strides, tracked the leader outside of BUNSTER
through the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch, raced three wide in the tracking flight into the far turn, weakened three wide
around that bend and had no more for the drive. WATER MOCCASIN chased midfield inside horses, lost ground inside foes through the far turn, and was
empty for the drive. JACK SNIPE'S took back when CADET CAPTAIN came inward in the opening strides, floated three wide into the first turn, chased

of a mile. PIERETTE saved ground around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three

Footnotes
NATIVE LION chased the leading trio through the first turn and into the backstretch, made a three wide bid past the half, attended the leading flight three
wide through the far turn, engaged outside of MOON OVER CABO past the five sixteenths, separated from the rest of the field along with that foe in upper
stretch, wrested the lead for good approaching the furlong mark and ran clear. ACCORDING TO ASPEN settled two wide toward the rear, took closer order
between horses on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and floated even wider as the rear echelon of the field contracted, bumped PRINCESS CORA
as she bulled between horses six wide past the furlong pole, finished full of run and got up for the place. LAUNCH AWAY soon trailed, raced two wide in the
rear pair on the far turn, shifted four wide past the three sixteenths, bumped with PRINCESS CORA past the furlong pole after that one had been bumped
by ACCORDING TO ASPEN, rallied well, but was nipped for the place. FALL MOON settled in second last, was urged three wide into the far turn, rallied
three to four wide around that bend, swung four wide into the stretch, ran on well six to seven wide past midstretch but was narrowly outfinished. ELKE DO
JAGUARETE (BRZ) settled toward the rear, continued patiently while saving ground on the far turn, and offered a belated rail rally in the lane. MOON OVER
CABO stalked the leader, engaged to her outside past the half mile mark, took the lead past the three eighths, was engaged by NATIVE LION to her outside
past the five sixteenths, vied inside of her into the lane as they sprinted clear of the rest of the field, was headed for good approaching the furlong mark and
weakened. SUPERSTAR BEA tracked the leading pair, lost position into the far turn as others began to rally past her, came into the lane between horses,
battled on to midstretch, but flattened out late. GUEST IN MY HEART settled near the rear two wide through the first turn, advanced on the outside down
the backstretch, came into the far turn in the leading line into the far turn, attended three wide around the bend, could not match the leading pair into the
lane, and weakened in the final furlong. WINDY CITY GIRL chased two wide, took closer order past the half, chased two to three wide around the far turn,
shuffled out six wide as the back of the field contracted in upper stretch, and came up empty. PRINCESS CORA chased inside of WINDY CITY GIRL,
continued midfield inside around the far turn, swung out into the lane, chased on four wide to midstretch, took up sharply when bumped by ACCORDING TO
ASPEN past the furlong mark, and weakened. TIZALADYBUG cleared to the lead, was engaged by MOON OVER CABO past the half mile mark, was
headed past the three eighths and tailed off inside. THE RIDER OF PRINCESS CORA CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF LAUNCH AWAY,
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE LANE. ADDITIONALLY, THE STEWARDS MADE AN INQUIRY INTO THE ACTIONS OF ACCORDING TO ASPEN
AND LAUNCH AWAY. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

KANFU tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid near the five sixteenths pole, angled in
entering the stretch, and gained ground rapidly in the final sixteenth of a mile to get up for the win. ME TOO MO veered out leaving the gate, recovered to
press
the
pace
on
the
inside
up
the
backstretch,
saved
ground
around
the
turn,
and
gained
ground
on
the
outside
in

stretch.
SOMTHINGSCANDALOUS tracked the leaders between horses early, saved ground around the turn, began a bid nearing the three sixteenths pole and
gained ground late between horses. WINNAGER hopped up leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile,
navigated the turn from the two path and improved position in the stretch. SIMPLY FAST bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, trailed the
field on the rail up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. STOPSHOPPINGAMY raced in the middle
of the pack on the inside in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked on the rail in the final furlong. SWEET PRAYERS broke
quickly, led the field from the two path up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and weakened late while drifting out in the
final sixteenth of a mile. LA NEGRA NOCHE was blocked at the start when the horses to either side of her came in, raced between horses in the middle of
the pack up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was empty in the stretch. BOURBON BLUES was bumped and then pinched back
leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was never a threat. TEMRIK raced off the pace
on the outside early, came around the turn in the three path and made no bid. OZETTE raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening
quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the four path and faded entering the stretch. FOO FOO GIRL stalked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch. AN OBJECTION WAS MADE BY THE RIDER OF THE HORSE THAT FINISHED THIRD,

Footnotes
WILDWOOD MAGGIE settled toward the rear, was pushed along up the inside from the seven sixteenths and rallied, split horses approaching the quarter
pole, rallied three wide under a drive, rolled to the lead at the sixteenth and ran clear. COLOROFACLOUD was awkwardly into stride, settled near the rear
outside of WILDWOOD MAGGIE, began to improve inside into the turn, was taken out past the three eighths to continue her rally three wide, sustained a
rally four wide in the lane but was outfinished by the winner. MOONLIGHT DANCING disputed the early pace inside, cleared to the lead out of the chute, set
the pace down the backstretch and while saving ground through the turn, cleared in upper stretch, was headed near the sixteenth pole by the winner,
flattened out but saved third. UNBURNT chased outside of MARY'S A JEM early, inched forward two wide into the turn, rallied in the three path on the turn,
was driven two wide into the lane, kept on with interest but missed the show. FARCICAL veered out in the opening strides, settled at the rear, raced at the
rear in the six to seven path on the turn, floated into the stretch in the seven to eight path, and improved belatedly outside. ZAPPI was off slowly, settled
second last, took closer order two wide into the turn, rallied between horses from the five sixteenths, floated in to the lane in the six path, and passed tired
horses. HOT PEPPER SUZIE came away three wide with the leading flight, tracked behind and outside of the pacesetter down the backstretch, stalked in
the two path around the turn, could not match her into the lane, and weakened inside. B REWARDING came away between horses with the leading flight,
settled back to track the leading trio out of the chute, lost ground on them past the eleven sixteenths, saved ground around the turn, came into the lane
under a drive inside, but flattened out. MARY'S A JEM hit the gate, chased well behind the leading foursome inside of UNBURNT, was pushed along two
wide on the turn, and made no bid. NO PASSING ZONE chased inside of SWAMP WITCH HADDY, began to lose ground past the five eighths, raced in the
three path on the turn, and came up empty. SWAMP WITCH HADDY chased outside of NO PASSING ZONE down the backstretch, continued midfield in
the four path on the turn, but emptied out at the three eighths. COOKIN ROSES was away with the leading flight four wide, tracked the pace outside of HOT
PEPPER SUZIE to the half mile mark, stopped, faded four to five wide around the turn and was eased in the lane.
