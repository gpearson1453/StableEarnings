Footnotes
FLASH N' DANCE dueled for the lead inside a pair of foes around the turn, shook free in upper stretch, then held under driving pressure. APPEALING WAY
shifted three wide into the turn while well off of the pace, then swung six wide turning for home, and offered a belated rally on her left lead. FOUR K'S
stalked two wide, tipped to the four path turning for home to be outside of the leading trio, produced a bid through the lane, but did not have enough to catch
the loose leader before being outfinished by a wider foe for place. JORDAN'S KITTEN shied in at the start, trailed the field along the inside into the turn,
swung six wide turning for home, and rallied grindlngly while chasing the leaders through the lane. FUN PADDY tracked from midpack three wide around
the turn, and failed to make a bid. DOUBLE OAKED raced far off of the pace two wide, shifted seven wide turning for home, and offered a belated charge,
but missed minor rewards. BONITA SPRINGS dueled for the lead three wide, but failed to keep pace with the inner leader at the quarter pole, and tired.
IGOTTAWHITEFACE stalked the pace along the inside, but failed to produce a bid before tiring through the lane. MAGIC FINNISH saved ground from
midpack, but was done early. WAR EAGLE'S LOVE dueled for the lead two wide and between horse, but weakened passing the quarter pole. HOLY
COOKIE was caught four wide far off of the pace around the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
INFINITE stalked three wide, bid for the lead three wide at the quarter pole, forged an advantage from the inner game leader approaching the sixteenth
pole, and cleared off late. KNIGHTS KEY saved ground far off of the pace into the turn, shifted six wide straightening into into the lane, produced a grinding
rally outside of foes, and just got up for place at the wire. YAMATO pulled a bit into the turn to set the pace along the inside, dug in gamely to hold an
advantage through upper stretch, but was headed by the eventual winner approaching the sixteenth pole, yielded, then was nailed on the wire for place.
CHASIN CHARLIE trailed early on, saved ground around the turn, and produced a mild rally along the rail for a minor reward. SNIPER KITTEN stalked from
the pocket around the turn, tipped two wide turning for home to attempt a bid, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the three sixteenths pole, and tired
through the closing stages. VIVID VERSE tracked from midpack in the three to four path around the turn, but failed to factor. ROYAL BLUE BOY tracked
from midpack in the two path around the turn, but weakened turning for home. STORMCOAST advanced in the four to five path and outside of foes through
the latter part of the turn to produce a mild bid outside of foes in upper stretch, but flattened out in midstretch and weakened. MIDNIGHT SWAP prompted
the pace two wide, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole, and stopped through the lane.

ROYAL APPROVAL dueled for the lead two wide, then drew off passing the furlong pole under driving pressure. RISKY REWARD dueled for the lead inside
of the eventual winner, dug in in upper stretch to hold an advantage from that foe, but was bested at the furlong marker, then held place. FLUTISTE raced
forwardly placed four wide, rallied between horses in midstretch, and prevailed for show. MUMMY DEAREST saved ground off of the pace around the turn,
swung six wide in upper stretch, and offered a mild kick, but failed to achieve show. TEMPER TIME stalked three wide and between horses, forged show in
upper stretch and held that position to the sixteenth pole while chasing the clear leaders, then tired in the late stages. THINKING saved ground far off of the
pace, advanced while shifting to the three path in upper stretch, but was outfinished for minor rewards. YABA DABA DIVA raced far off of the pace three to
four wide around the turn, but failed to menace. DEMETER was bumped at the start, trailed in field in the three to four path around the turn, and never got
involved. BATTLE BLING saved ground in midpack, attempted a mild rail bid for minor rewards, but flattened out in midstretch, and weakened late.
BLUEGRASS BELLE stalked the pace in the two path, but weakened in upper stretch. GOLDEN ACCOUNT took the turn in the two path while off of the
pace around the turn, and never got involved. CLASS RIOT vied for the lead along the inside, stalked around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch, and
stopped.

Footnotes
SHACKLEFORD'S JOY saved ground off of the pace, produced a rail bid for the lead in upper stretch, cleared off, and held sway under driving pressure.
CHURN N BURN stalked four wide, produced a five wide bid between horses in midstretch, and prevailed for place. AMERICAN MANDATE dueled for the
lead along the inside into the turn, stalked the rank loose leader around that bend, rebid for the lead three wide and between horses in midstretch, but was
outfinished. CARAMELITO took the turn in the three to four path before swinging eight wide turning for home, rallied on his left lead outside of foes through
the lane, but not enough for minors. STANDUP was bumped at the start tracked from midpack in the two path, came into the lane five wide and between
horses, but finished up evenly. SMILE BRYAN bumped at the start, raced off of the pace two wide around the turn, and failed to menace. UNCAPPED was
fractious in the gate, then failed to factor. UNTRACEABLE was forwardly placed three wide, but was bothered by a rank for into the turn, steadied back to
midpack, shifted six wide in upper stretch, but weakened. HEROS REWARD dueled for the lead two wide, stalked the rank leader through the latter part of
the turn before rebidding four wide in upper stretch, but weakened between horses at the furlong pole. TURN OF EVENTS tracked from midpack two wide,
but steadied when bothered by an inner rank foe into the turn, then failed to factor. WELL CONNECTED broke inwards, rushed inside of foes while very
rank, pulled three wide into the turn bothering multiple foes, cleared three wide around the turn, but weakened and stopped in upper stretch. THE FEATURE
was never involved.
