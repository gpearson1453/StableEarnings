Footnotes
TOWSON dueled for command two wide, regained the lead entering the stretch, edged away under mild handling. MARNESIA BIG GIRL, racing inside
winner alternating for the lead, was unable to match strides late. PRETTY COOL CAT, reluctant to load causing a delay, saved ground and was up for show
in the final strides. IF YOU ONLY KNEW raced in the three path, drifted out under left handed pressure early stretch, was not persevered late and was
nailed for show. KENDYL ELIZABETH raced outside early, moved to the rail on final turn and was no factor. DRIVEN BY SPEED raced wide and failed to
menace. NATASHA FATALE, three wide in top flight, stopped.

Footnotes
ELLARELLA rushed to the front inside, widened in hand on the final turn then was kept to a drive late to preserve the victory. MAGICALLYDELICIOUS
pursued the winner outside, continued gamely but was no match for the winner. COUSIN BASIL stumbled at the start while breaking sharply, saved ground
and tired. SOLID GOLD DANCER lacked speed, chased outside and lacked a rally. ELIANA'S MISSION dropped back along the inside and was never in
contention. MISQUILLO trailed early and raced far back throughout. MISS MOON PIE stalked the pace three wide, moved closer on the final turn then gave
way.

Footnotes
FRISKY WHISKEY broke slowly but quickly moved up along the rail, drifted out opening a clear lead and lasted. LUNA AZTECA was extremely wide
throughout and finished fast to just miss. IMPERIAL LADY, outrun racing two wide, closed too late. NOT IN THE MOOD saved ground while unhurried,
lacked a strong rally. MAD MARY set the pace in three path before tiring. CONGRESSIONALSTORM, outside and just off the pace, faded. ROCHELA
broke slowly, saved ground and tired. MARY COSTA, wide and just off the pace, gave way. MISSES KNIGHT, between foes dueling, was blocked in mid
stretch while tiring.

Footnotes
CINNAMON LATTE dueled along the inside, moved clear on the turn then held rival safe through the stretch in a determined score. OUR DIXIE BLUE
saved ground throughout, bid into the stretch, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. FRISKY FEELING broke very slowly, raced very wide and
closed well while no threat. DISCREETLY TOUGH broke sluggishly, raced well back then showed some late energy. HERE COMES MEG chased close up
to the far turn then faltered. TINY TURBO trailed early then passed fading rivals in the stretch. LUSCIOUS LOLA raced in mid-pack and lacked a rally.
SOUR MASH chased outside, drifted wide on the turn and faded. WONDER CHARM earned a narrow lead outside early then gave way readily.

Footnotes
MANOLETE never had to leave the rail, took the lead early stretch and won with speed to spare. GRAVES ISLAND was in motion in the starting gate and
had his head turned to left breaking slowly, was fanned out soon after, hustled to race just off the pace between foes, fell back but then came on again to
gain place. DROSSELMAGIC, three wide and just off the pace, moved out wider and had no late kick. THE GREAT SAMURAI, two wide and never far back,
moved in a bit through stretch and finished well. NAVY COMMANDER set the pace just off the rail, drifted slightly leaving the turn and faded. FAST
RUNNER saved ground, never threatened and was being eased through the stretch. PHARAOH'S CITY came out after the start then failed to menace.
BADUKE showed little.

OUR FLIRTATION settled off the pace, angled inside after the half, then wore down the pacesetter and held off outside rival. PASS IT ON saved ground
early close up, moved wide into the stretch and finished gamely. ALLERIA stalked the leaders outside, moved very wide on the final turn and through the
stretch. SMARTY CAT set a clear pace to the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. LOYAL AFICIONADA trailed for half a mile, moved wide on the final
turn and showed some late energy. TWEETY KITTEN dropped back in the opening quarter and lacked a rally. LOST SCROLL broke sluggishly and raced
far behind and was never a factor. CELTIC VOW urged just off the leader in the two path then began fading on the final turn. PABLO'S DREAM fanned wide
on the first turn, remained wide and stopped. Fractional times were unavailable.

SPEED SYNDROME broke slowly and was far back early racing just off the rail, moved out on the final turn, raced wider through stretch and was just up.
GRAY GARY set the pace in five path, moved closer to the rail on the far turn, resisted when challenged and fought gamely to wire. MR CLASSICAL moved
off the rail on the final turn, was steadied lacking room near quarter pole, moved out wide and closed too late. BOAT OVER THE HILL, three wide early,
went between foes on the final turn and then weakened. GRAND OASIS, in the three path while just off the pace, faded. HUSSAR saved ground,
challenged on the backstretch then weakened. YONDERING, wide and just off the pace, tired. KING'S GOLD also raced wide and never threatened.

Footnotes
THE WANT OF A NAIL stalked the pace four wide, bid into the stretch, wore down the pacesetter and lasted while drifting out late. BLACK LIGHT lacked
speed, advanced wide, closed strongly, was bumped from late and just missed. SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS forced the pace outside, faded on the turn then
came again in the stretch, came out and bumped rival and missed. CLEVER SARAH sprinted clear along the inside then weakened slightly through the
stretch. BREEZY GUST prompted the leader in the two path and continued willingly. GET SET lacked speed then passed rivals late without menacing.
SMART AND TOUGH was taken up sharply early and never a factor. AMERICAN QUALITY roughed early, chased inside, angled out in the stretch and
flattened. ASHRAQ chased in mid-pack and began fading on the turn. DEVILRY dropped back early and was always outrun. Claims of foul by the third
finisher against the top two finishers for interference in the stretch were dismissed.

TWO CARAT eased off the rail on the far turn, steadily increased her lead and was fully extended until deep stretch. ANGEL RAPHAEL, racing in the four
path while just off the pace, was no match. MADELYN'S DANCER split rivals on the turn and passed faders. PRINCES DYNAMITE set the pace inside,
gave up position without argument, drifted out and dropped back. ALLEGRETTO raced outside while just off the pace then tired. TAYLOR'S BELLE, wide,
failed to menace. POSSEINEFFECTTOO saved ground and showed little. LA VENEZOLANA (VEN), in the four path just off the pace, tired. MUCHA
MUCHACHA was hustled to the lead soon after the start, injured herself in the opening furlong, was pulled up and vanned off.
