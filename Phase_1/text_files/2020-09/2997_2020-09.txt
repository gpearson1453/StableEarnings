Footnotes
TEXAS RULE was settled off the leaders while angling to the inside crossing the path of SHAKELAS DESTINY racing into the first turn, tracked just off the
second flight into the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing the far turn while advancing to challenge, moved to strike the front in that path racing into
upper stretch, lugged inwards nearing the furlong marker but was quickly righted to gain a narrow advantage in time under firm handling. CHATTER BOX,
reserved outside foes just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside after a half, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch
carrying out EDGIE REGGIE but continued to make steady progress to close the gap while prevailing for the place honors. LOW TIDE WARNING was rated
along the inside tracking just off the first flight in the opening stages, swerved off the rail racing past the three quarter mile marker, was righted to continued
along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch, then continued with some interest between foes to prevail for a share. ICYWILBURNYEH, urged prompting
pace the outside a rival from the outset to the backstretch, dueled for command between foes into the lane resisting the winner's bid but yielded late. STAY
MY FAYVORITE, forwardly placed three wide in the opening stages, tracked off the first flight between foes to the far turn but lacked the needed final kick.
SHAKELAS DESTINY angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight, checked sharply out of tight quarters racing past the three quarter mile
marker, switched outside foes on the backstretch, continued well off the leaders while angling out entering the lane and made no real impression.
MOONSHINE MOXY sprinted to the lead along the inside, dueled for command inside foes into the far turn and gave way into the lane. EDGIE REGGIE
tracked the leaders as part of the second flight racing into the first turn, was carried out midway through that bend, was righted to track the leaders three
wide in second flight through the backstretch, steadily faded entering the far turn and was carried six wide into the lane. DRIED PEPPER dropped out early.

Footnotes
STITZY was rated along the inside tracking off the first flight in the opening half, shifted out three wide on the far turn commencing a steady advance and
took over leaving midstretch to go clear under firm encouragement. L' CRISTABAL, urged to dispute the pace while angling to the rail racing into the first
turn, was headed after a half, continued with a grudging effort resisting several challenges but proved no match in the closing stages while lasting for
second. ALWAYS COOL settled last near the inside early, shifted out three wide after a half and continued with an even effort to improve position outside
foes into the lane. RUNTECH, urged prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue through the backstretch to edge forward to a narrow advantage racing into
the far turn but gave out entering the lane. PRAISE BE TO GOD, forwardly placed three wide in early stages, tracked off the first flight between foes through
the backstretch but faded early.

Footnotes
BEST KEPT SECRET sped to the lead along the inside to dictate the pace on a comfortable margin into the backstretch, shifted out racing into upper
stretch to race in the three path through the final three sixteenths but maintained a safe margin under some right handed pressure. TEE EM EYE tracked
the pacesetter between rivals in second flight to the backstretch, conceded some position under patient handling racing into the far turn, was prompted to
advance while shifting out four wide racing into the lane but couldn't gain even terms with the winner while edging a rival for the place honors. CHANCE TO
SHINE, pulling a bit in early stages, was rated along the inside just off the second flight, saved ground through the far turn to advance along the rail lodging
a bid inside the winner but was outkicked while missing second. APPLE DAPPLE tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight, shifted out to lodge a
brief bid between foes leaving the midway point of the far turn but flattened out entering the lane. BEACH FLOWER tracked the leaders three wide in
second flight, faded racing into the far turn but kept on well enough to regain some position late. TIZ LITTLE BULL exchanged bumps with GLAMORIZED at
the start, was settled between foes in the last flight early and failed to menace. APPEALING AUDREY, pulling a bit between foes racing into the first turn,
was guided inwards nearing the backstretch to track off the second flight between rivals, shifted to the rail on the far turn while making some brief progress
but came up empty racing into the lane. GLAMORIZED exchanged bumps at the start, settled outside foes while caught wide to the backstretch but offered
no rally.

RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC was rated just off the first flight racing four wide through the backstretch into the turn, was roused to challenge racing into upper
stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. GOTHAM CITY QUEEN, in touch with the leaders three deep attending the pace, pressed the issue on
the turn into upper stretch gaining a brief advantage but proved no match for the winner. SWEET AS CANBE tracked just off the first flight along the inside
racing into the turn, shifted outside foes entering the lane and continued well enough to gain a share. ARNOLD'S PATSY, bumped at the start, was settled
last through the backstretch, angled four wide racing into upper stretch and passed some tiring foes. A ROZE AND WINE, urged between foes prompting
the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way into the lane. DEFEND THE ROSE broke out bumping ARNOLD'S PATSY at the start, was urged inside
rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening quarter and gave out racing into the lane.

FRANK THE MAYOR was rated just off the leaders along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep after a half gaining terms with those
foes, pressed the issue three wide on the far turn, continued in a prolonged skirmish past midstretch and edged forward late under firm handling. BUBBA
BOB was rated stalking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, was urged to bid for command between foes racing into the far turn, grudgingly resisted
the winner to late stages but proved only second best. PAINT I AIN'T settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, shifted three wide entering the lane and
continued to improve position. MUSKYMAN settled last along the rail racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. RISKY SITUATION, a bit washy prior
to the race, was urged to the lead along the rail racing to the backstretch dictating the pace on a narrow margin, then gave way once headed racing through
the far turn.

SCATTERED CASH was settled along the inside in the opening half, shifted off the rail after six furlongs gaining some position, swung six wide on the far
turn advancing to contention between rivals and produced a stout rally racing through the stretch to edge HAMAZING VISION in time under firm left handed
pressure. The latter was rated just off the first flight between foes in the opening half mile, angled to the rail nearing the second bend while conceding
position under patient handling to the third bend, split foes racing into upper stretch to gain the lead late but couldn't fend off the winner. NORCO, rated off
the first flight along the inside in the opening half mile, was prompted to advance four wide between foes, swung five wide into the lane and continued to
improve position. IRISH MAJOR, caught five wide racing into the first turn tracking as part of the second flight, angled inwards to track between foes to the
third bend, was prompted to make some brief progress three deep between foes but was outkicked in the drive. REAL LUTE, forwardly placed along the
inside stalking just off the first flight, shifted three wide nearing the third bend while being urged to challenge for command but soon lost the advantage and
faded into the lane. TYLER'S TEK raced three wide between foes just off the second flight through the first turn, angled to the rail after the opening half to
make some brief progress inside foes racing to the third bend but had no closing bid. MASKED was hustled to the lead outside foes racing to the first turn,
angled to the rail setting the pace on a narrow margin, dueled for command inside foes to the third turn and gave way abruptly nearing the lane. BORN
FORCE tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening mile, steadied out of tight quarters entering the third turn and had no closing bid. TEDDY
TIME settled last along the inside in the opening mile, was fanned seven wide leaving the third turn but offered no rally. WHERE'S JORDAN, caught four
wide between foes tracking just off the second flight in the opening half, continued four, then five wide into the third turn and steadily faded. BLUE BOMBER,
urged to terms prompting the pacesetter in the opening quarter to the third turn, gave way abruptly after nine furlongs.

HURTS SO GOOD broke readily, angled inwards after the opening furlong tracking just off the first flight under light rating racing into the bend, split foes
three wide nearing upper stretch advancing on the pacesetter, then continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage and go clear under firm
left handed pressure. SEANSHINE broke sharply, was urged along the rail dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the bend, dueled inside foes on the
turn, gained a clear advantage racing into upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid but proved only second best. MALIBU JACK vied for command three wide
between foes racing into the turn, shifted inwards entering the lane and had no final kick. POVERTY FLATS settled along the inside, saved ground through
the turn and improved position inside foes late. BOLD PROPOSITION, off slowly, raced four wide into the turn, was fanned seven wide nearing midstretch
and gained some position with an even effort. CHOCOLOGIST, urged prompting the pace five wide racing into the turn, gave way nearing the lane.
RASMUS was settled between foes while angling inwards in early stages, continued three deep into the turn, shifted out six wide racing into upper stretch
but had no late bid. BULLY FOR ERIC, urged four wide between foes prompting the pace, gave way into the lane. DAZZL'N MISCHIEF, off a step slowly,
was urged between rivals prompting the pace racing into the turn, shifted inwards nearing the lane and quickly came up empty. CAPTAIN OF SUMMER was
outpaced early.

HEART FULL OF SOUL broke readily to gain a narrow advantage, dictated the pace in hand along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out nearing upper
stretch, repelled a challenge from STRONG RULES racing into upper stretch and kicked away late under firm right handed encouragement. The latter broke
out bumping EDGE TO EDGE, was righted, then pulled his way between foes to gain a position just off the leader while angling inside that foe racing into
the turn, shifted out three wide on the bend while advancing to challenge nearing upper stretch, couldn't gain even terms with the winner and just held a rival
for the place honors. EDGE TO EDGE, bumped at the start, angled to the rail tracking just off the leaders racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch
and continued willingly inside the top pair to just miss for second. BIG IN THE CITY was settled last racing to the turn and passed inside tiring rivals in the
closing stages. BIG BUFFY, urged between foes prompting the pace into the turn, gave way nearing the lane. WESTA WAVERLY ducked out at the start,
was quickly righted, then urged three wide prompting the pace through the backstretch, drifted out nearing the lane, was quickly outdistanced while being
gathered up by his rider but walked off the course under his own power.

KING OF THE COURT, forwardly placed along the rail stalking just off the first flight in the opening quarter, advanced to press the issue inside foes through
the turn and was roused clear in upper stretch to hold ARCADIA CALLS safe to the wire. The latter was settled along the rail dropping out last racing to the
turn, gathered momentum while shifting out four wide in upper stretch and was going well late to close the gap on the winner nearing the wire. THE
TABULATOR angled inwards prompting the pace in the three path racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue in that path into the turn and gave way
leaving midstretch. KELLER'S GOLD, restless in the gate before the start, broke readily, was urged between disputing the pace racing through the
backstretch into the turn and gave way in upper stretch. SLEWS HYMN tracked just off the first flight between foes in the opening quarter, angled to the rail
entering the turn and steadily faded into the lane. HONDO LANE switched outside rivals early tracking just outside the first flight to the turn, gave way early
while drifting wide into the stretch.

TIME FOR KISSES was rated just out of striking distance tracking the first flight four wide through the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path
through the turn to upper stretch and just collared SMART N WICKED nearing the wire in a prolonged drive. The latter raced in touch with the pacesetter
three deep between foes prompting that rival through the backstretch, pressed the issue on the turn to gain the advantage racing into upper stretch, then
grudgingly resisted the winner to the end. COUNCIL RULES tracked off the first flight five wide in the opening quarter, continued in that path through the
turn to upper stretch and continued well enough to gain a share late while being taken in hand in nearing the wire. DISTINCT APPROVAL, reserved off the
second flight in early stages, gained position between foes racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. PAPA'S ISLA DOLL, urged to dictate
the pace between foes on a narrow margin through the backstretch into the turn, dueled for command through the bend and gave way racing into upper
stretch. LIL B QUICK, urged along the inside prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn, gave way early. REMARKABLE CHARM broke
awkwardly and trailed throughout.

VIVA FOREVER was rated just off the first flight five wide in the opening stages, advanced in tandem with several rivals four wide on the turn, shifted out six
deep in upper stretch while moving to challenge for command and dug in nearing the wire to just edge BONNET in time under firm encouragement. The
latter tracked just off the first flight three deep between foes racing into the turn, split foes four deep when presented an opening nearing midstretch, moved
to gain a narrow advantage between calls late and just failed to contain the winner. CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR settled inside foes in the last flight in early
stages, shifted off the rail gradually gathering momentum racing into upper stretch, angled seven wide racing past the furlong marker and found her best
stride late to close the gap while earning a share. SWEET BLINDNESS bobbled at the start, angled inwards tracking off the first flight racing through the
backstretch,split rivals just off the inside to challenge for command nearing the furlong marker gaining a brief advantage but failed to sustain that
momentum. CAUSIN MISCHIEF was rated just off the second flight along the inside racing into the turn, came around a tiring foe to bid along the rail in
upper stretch but had no final kick. SIERRITA settled between foes in the last flight early, was fanned eight wide racing into upper stretch and made no
impression. SMOKIN HOT MOMMA, forwardly placed three wide stalking just off the pacesetter, advanced to press the issue in that path racing through the
turn, gained a brief lead in upper stretch but gave way leaving the furlong marker. HUSH Y'ALL settled outside foes in early stages and never gained
contention. MIZZEN AIR hopped at the start, was urged between foes to gain a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter, moved to prompt that rival
between foes racing into the turn and gave way entering upper stretch. LUCKY LITTLE LADY was urged to the lead while angling to the rail in the opening
quarter, dueled for command inside foes racing into the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

GOLDEN LILY was rated off the second flight along the inside racing through the backstretch, continued under patient handling while shifting out five wide
nearing upper stretch, then rallied smartly through the lane to wrest the advantage in time under firm encouragement. HEAVENLY ARCH, urged to the lead
racing a bit off the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. U S S LOIS, reserved
along the inside dropping well off the second flight in early stages, split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch and continued with interest inside
foes to prevail for a share. GOING RUNNING TOO, bumped at the start, was quickly righted to gain a forward placing between foes tracking just off the
pacesetter racing into the turn and faded into the stretch. MZ JACKIE tracked just off the pacesetter three wide between foes racing into the turn and gave
way in the drive. LAURA N LUKAS was rated just outside the second flight racing through the backstretch, was prompted to make brief progress four wide
on the turn to loom outside the leader but emptied out in upper stretch. GOLDEN GOPHER broke outwards bumping a rival, was collected to track off the
second flight outside the eventual winner, drifted out racing into the turn and soon gave way. JAKEALINA tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight
in the opening three furlongs and faded into the stretch. MINI WHINNY broke awkwardly, was outdistanced early but walked off the course under her own
power.

DEVIL VISION was settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside on the far turn gradually gaining momentum, shifted
three wide in upper stretch to advance between rivals and found his best stride in the closing stages to just nip MINNESOTA MIRACLE on the wire under
firm encouragement. The latter tracked just off the pacesetter three wide into the first turn, made steady progress to advance on that rival racing into the far
turn, wrested the advantage midway through that bend, went clear into upper stretch while angling to the rail and just failed to contain the winner. FINN
COUNTRY, restless in the gate before the start, was settled three deep between foes racing to the backstretch, split foes on the far turn, shifted four wide
racing into upper stretch and continued with a mild bid. WATER PATROL settled inside foes in the last flight early, steadily gained position while shifting just
off the inside racing into the lane but had no final kick. MINNESOTA LUCKY, urged to the lead outside a rival racing into the first turn, went clear after the
opening quarter, dictated the pace a bit off the rail racing to the far turn and gave way once headed nearing upper stretch. WARRIOR BOSS, caught four
wide in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance outside foes after a half but never gained striking distance. BLAME BISHOP
tracked just off the first flight between foes racing into the first turn, shifted out four wide after a half and soon emptied out. SILVER DASH, urged along the
rail prompting a rival's pace into the first turn, gave way early, was outdistanced racing into the far turn but walked off the course under his own power..
