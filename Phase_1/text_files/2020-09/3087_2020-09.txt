well. START FROM SCRATCH slow early rallied on the far turn bidding four wide down the lane. GENERAL DIRECTION tracked the pace to the far turn
then weakened near mid track the final eighth. RUM ON THE ROCKS raced mid pack fading to upper stretch. I'LL MAKE U FAMOUS was never involved.

CALENDULA away alertly set the pace being roused to draw off on the far turn continuing to expand the margin in upper stretch winning as much the best.
FOXY GATOR stalked close up through the backside then chased a loose leader into upper stretch making no headway there while securing place.
CIPHERIN' SUE gave a prompted middle move chasing a loose leader on the far turn going evenly through the lane. ORIENTAL LADY hesitated breaking
slowly, gained on the backside chasing on the far turn then weakened in upper stretch. TIZ BEAUTY raced mid pack fading on the far turn. LA LOVA gave
way on the backside. MUSHABOOM pressed the early pace then wilted on the far turn.

WEE MONIE CREEK bumped and in tight at the break would race evenly through the turn rallying along the inside down the stretch gamely prevailing over
wide running foes late. DREAM PARK hustled clear set the pace staying off the inside through the turn angling to the seven path in upper stretch becoming
weary late unable to hold off an inside challenge. SEALED WITH A KISS rallied on the turn losing ground to upper stretch bidding nine wide being right
there at the end. TRULY VAL chased the pace looming through the turn racing wide into upper stretch extending late in the eight path being outfinished.
LADY PANTHER slow early saved ground to upper stretch finishing well on the inside. MS. NINEONESEVEN faded on the turn. CHARLIES HOT slow early
played no factor. GLORIOUS RIDE retreated on the turn. CHARLIES WATCHIN gave way on the turn.
