ON FIRE set the pace with a clear lead, repulsed a bid at the quarter pole, prevailed after a long stretch drive under firm handling. FAT DADDY was never
far back, rallied on the inside and finished well to be up for place. ISTILLGOTIT stalked the winner, rallied at the quarter pole and drew close was outfinished
late. OPEN OUT was well placed early, had a mild bid late. JOSIE'S RIDDLE allowed to settle, failed to menace. PALTARREVENGE was bumped soon
after the start and settled early, had a middle move and tired in the stretch.
