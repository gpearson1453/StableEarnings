Footnotes
JILL broke outward but gained a short early lead, drew clear quickly, set a reserved pace, was hustled into the stretch then although tiring in the stretch,
finished best under light handling. SLASHS RED DIAMOND got away slowly and settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, moved
to the rail in the final furlong and finished gamely. KENTUCKY FAN settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn then rallied gamely,
but late. ENDORPHIN RUSH in range, was hustled two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the late stages. MONEY IN THE POOL,
off a step slowly, moved up quickly to press the pace, chased from the rail on the turn but tired in the stretch. STORMY JESS forced the pace, dropped back
nearing the turn, was hustled along the rail then had no response in the stretch. .

HASSAH (GB) raced in mid pack, closed five then four-wide through the turn, bid upper stretch and quickly drove clear then finished under a hand ride.
SOTHATSTHEWAYITIS sprinted clear from the break, set a pressured pace, was headed upper stretch but held the place. TAYLER'S THE BOSS broke
inward and bumped SUGATI starting a domino effect, stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. MODUS
OPERANDI broke in the air, settled in mid pack, chased two and three-wide on the turn and was all out through the stretch. REXDALE, in mid pack early,
came three and four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but never reached contention. BEAR KITTY, bumped by SUGATI at the outset, closed to
mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then finished gamely. AFLEET CONNECTION was off a step slowly and lost her path, raced
from off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn then closed with some interest in the stretch. SUGATI bumped with the mares from both sides at the
start, moved up to force the pace, was game through the turn but backed away at the top of the stretch and faded. PER RULING 1094118 FROM THE

Footnotes
SUNSPRITE pressed the pace from the rail, dueled on the turn, shook clear upper stretch, was kept to business then finished under a hand ride. DEJAS
TOO pressed the pace, stalked three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished determinedly. VERY SAVVY pressed the pace, dropped back
early turn, chased four-wide to the stretch then finished gamely. GAMBLE'S SILVER, in range, was hustled two-wide on the turn then finished evenly. HIGH
SOCIETY GIRL held a short early lead, dueled on the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch then flattened out with a 16th to run. SAVED AT THE WIRE
was close early, dropped back nearing the turn, was hustled three-wide but lacked a rally in the stretch. SILENT SPARKLE, off slowly, was used early to
gain contention, stalked the pace from the rail but backed away at the top of the stretch. THE TWELFTH broke poorly and was well back throughout. VOIR
DIRE was also off slowly and was always well back, was eased through the stretch but crossed the wire and walked off.

TEACHER'S PET, in range, came three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and swept to the lead a 16th out under a hand ride. MISS BOBBIT
pressed the pace, stalked the duel on the turn, was up close and failed to draw even between the battlers in upper stretch but was determined and got up
for place. SILVER DAHLIA bumped with horses on both side leaving the gate settled at the rear, was hustled two-wide and from the rail on the turn then
rallied late outside. AUNT TILLIE bumped with SILVER DAHLIA at the start, stalked early then forced the pace on the turn, bid approaching the top of the
stretch, dueled outside two rivals but was passed by the winner with a 16th to run. TOO MANY MOUNTANS stalked early then dropped back early turn,
angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn then finished gamely between foes. THE GOOD WITCH showed early speed and drew clear, was pressured
on the turn, dueled into the stretch, was passed a 16th out and gave way. LET'S HAVE FUN bumped with SILVER DAHLIA at the start, settled in mid pack,
saved ground on the turn then finished gamely. MY FINAL TRICK was steadied just out, settled at the back of the pack, ride the rail on the turn but lacked a
strong closing response.

Footnotes
GUITAR GEORGE trailed around the first turn while three to two wide, still trailed when moving up two to four wide on the far turn and fanned out into the
six path turning for home, drove by at the sixteenth pole and drew off, in hand the final two strides. FLORIDA WON was near the rear throughout in the two
path all the way, angled out between rivals in upper stretch and got outside at the eighth pole, finding his best stride in the final seventy yards, cruising up
for the place spot. COURT BATTLE came outside from his inside post to stalk the leader throughout, bid for the lead late on the turn and ground it out to get
by that one in upper stretch but was swallowed up by the winner at the sixteenth pole and lost the place spot in the final forty yards. THE BOSS FACTOR
hustled to the lead, was stalked throughout by a rival, was collared and headed by that one into upper stretch and gave way grudgingly late. FRANKIE
BARONE was four to three wide around the first turn near the rear, advanced three wide into mid pack on the far turn but leveled off down the lane while still
outside. BOURBON EXTENSION settled off the pace and along the rail, was roused by his rider on the far turn but only put in a mild rally down to the wire.
COURTLY MANNER was three wide stalking the two leaders throughout, was roused mid turn while still in range but had nothing down the lane. FIRE FOR
EFFECT sat in mid pack along the rail, was in contention to the quarter pole but had no punch down the stretch.

held sway under a hand ride. CLAIRESSENCE was away slowly and settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top
of the stretch, rallied outside and gained steadily to the end. GIZMO FLASH had brief speed then settled in mid pack, chased two to four-wide through the
turn then rallied gamely in the stretch. MAMITA'S CHICA raced in mid pack, came two-wide through the turn and finished under a determined drive. POST
TO POST, in mid pack early, raced four-wide on the turn then rallied mildly. FRESHIEINTHEFOREST hopped out of the gate and settled off the pace,
closed three and four-wide on the turn, was hemmed in behind rivals upper stretch then rallied when clear. CAROLINA GRACE settled off the pace, raced
along the rail and two-wide through the turn then was all out in the stretch but evened out late. SAILING BY gained the lead and set a pressured pace, was
engaged late turn, dueled, was passed upper stretch and chased in vain. DAD'S MISSY, in range, chased three-wide late turn then evened out in the final
furlong. WARNING BELLE pressed the pace, lapped onto the leader on the turn, dueled into the stretch, was passed quickly and gave way.
