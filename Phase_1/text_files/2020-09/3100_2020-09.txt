PENSAMIENTO stalked the pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and drove clear in the final stages. MERGE pressed the pace, raced three wide in the
lane and was no match for the winner. BAVARIA showed good speed along the inside and weakened a bit in the drive. WOLF OF THE NILE stalked the
pace along the inside down the backstretch and tired. MISTER ARANGUIZ broke in a tangle, lost a considerable amount of ground at the break, raced
along the inside and never threatened. SWEENEY'S CAT dropped back early and failed to have a response.

MORGANS MELODY stalked the early pace, raced three wide through the lane and drew off to be well clear under steady handling. FAST INTENTIONS
pressed the pace from the inside and was no match for the winner in the drive. STONE COLD settled off the early pace, raced four wide nearing the eighth
pole and had no final winning bid. SULLEYS BOO was slow early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. MAD MOMMA showed
good early speed along the inside and tired readily.
