Footnotes
RECODED stalked the pace along the inside, shifted three wide to be outside of the leading duelers at the quarter pole, produced a three wide bid for the
lead at the three sixteenths pole, then drew off through the final furlong under driving pressure. PICK UP THE FONE vied for the lead two wide into the turn,
forged an advantage turning for home, held it approaching the three sixteenths pole, but was headed passing that marker by RECORDED, proved no match
for that foe at the furlong pole, then held place while tiring. DUPLICITOUS prompted the pace three wide around the turn before being floated four wide by
an inner foe at the quarter pole, then kept on through the lane, and held show from PARKING TICKET in the final sixteenth. PARKING TICKET trailed the
field, came into the lane in the three path, then shifted to the five path in midstretch, and stayed on mildly outside of foes, but missed show. ERV'S WENCH
tracked from midpack in the two path, but failed to produce a bid. STOLEN BEAUTY set the pace along the inside, dueled inside of PICK UP THE FONE
into the turn, but was headed by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, dug in in upper stretch to hold position, but tired through the final furlong. UNFADING
BEAUTY raced far off of the pace in the two path, and was outrun. FACTOR AROUND raced off of the pace in the four path around the turn, weakened in
the five path in upper stretch, and was not persisted with through the lane despite feeling several shoulder taps from the rider.

Footnotes
ORSETTO set a loose and uncontested pace along the inside while in hand after being a bit keen through the early stages, then responded when asked
passing the quarter pole, drew off readily, and widened her advantage under driving pressure through the lane. WILD COMBO stalked the pace two wide
and inside of MARIAH'S PRINCESS, but came under pressure into the turn to inch forward along with that foe, failed to do so and was outpaced passing
the three furlong pole, then shifted three wide into the lane, and stayed on well to reclaim place. ANN IN THE MIDDLE was off a step slowly and trailed the
field early on, saved ground around the turn, and produced a mild rail rally through the lane for a minor reward. MARIAH'S PRINCESS stalked three wide,
inched closer to the loose leader around the turn while her inner counterpart failed to do so, produced a two wide bid for the lead turning for home, but
proved no match for the pace setter in upper stretch, and subsequently tired. MENZEL stumbled at the start and was done early. DANGER was off a step
slow, advanced from midpack in the three to four path around the turn to be in range of the lead turning for home, but weakened through the lane.
EXCESSIVE LADY tracked from midpack two wide, but bore out into the turn, failed to respond to correction and weakened around the bend, then was
eased through the lane, and walked off.

Footnotes
LOOKING AT LIBERTY swung five wide into the first turn to avoid trouble, raced far off of the pace in the two path into the far turn, advanced around that
bend before splitting foes three wide in upper stretch, then drove past the leader at the furlong pole, and drew off under driving pressure. INDIAN
COUNSELOR shied four wide into the first turn from an inner rank foe, took the far turn in the four to five path, then kept on between horses through the late
stages to secure place while not threatening the leader. FIRST RATE stalked the leading trio of duelers, chased those foes from the three to four path
around the far turn, drifted five wide in upper stretch, and was outfinished by an inner foe in the late stages while keeping on for a mild reward.
TRASHTALKINYANKEE vied for the lead three wide, dueled outside of a pair of foes around the far turn before assuming command turning for home, drew
clear in upper stretch, but was no match for an oncharging foe at the furlong pole, and tired. PAYNTER PARTY was fanned six wide into the first, raced far
off of the pace in the four to three path around the far turn, then stayed on as the pace collapsed, but failed to menace. HI HO CHEERIO got rank into the
first turn and caused wider foes to be fanned, tracked from midpack along the inside, but faded around the far turn and was done early. STREET CLASS
vied for the lead two wide and between horses, dueled around the far turn, but weakened turning for home, and stopped through the lane. SWORDSMAN
set a pressured pace inside of a pair of foes around the far turn, dueled for the lead inside of those rivals into the far turn, but weakened at the five
sixteenths pole, and wilted through the lane.

Footnotes
BIG AGENDA stalked the loose leader from the three path, bid for the lead three wide in midstretch, and edged away from inner foes under a long drive
approaching the wire. IMPERADOR (ARG) stalked along the inside of BIG AGENDA while in the two path, inched closer turning for home to bid for the lead
in upper stretch, but was outfinished by his outer counterpart approaching the wire. MY SIXTH SENSE cleared off around the first turn, dug in when
challenged by multiple foes in upper stretch, was headed by them at the furlong pole, then kept on gamely through the late stages, but was bested.
CULLUM ROAD saved ground far off of the pace, then stayed on between horses through the late stages for a minor share. ARGENTELLO (IRE) settled far
off of the pace two to three wide, advanced in the four path leaving the far turn, attempted a four wide bid through the lane, but flattened out in midstretch.
SET PIECE (GB) trailed the field after a bit of a slow start, advanced three wide around the far turn before swinging five wide in upper stretch, but failed to
sustain a rally. GOLDEN DRAGON saved ground from midpack around the turns, but tired. HIGH NORTH tracked from midpack two wide, but weakened
between horses into the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
COWORKER saved ground from midpack into the turns, shifted four wide approaching the quarter pole to produce a bid outside of the leaders in upper
stretch, then drew off under driving pressure. NOMO RON saved ground far off of the pace, shifted three wide in upper stretch, and rallied for place.
MALPAIS vied for the lead three wide around the turn, forged an advantage approaching the quarter pole, but was surpassed by COWORKER passing the
three sixteenths pole, proved on match for that foe, then tired late, but held show. SNAGGLETOOTH tracked from midpack in the two path around the turn,
came into the lane in the five path, and stayed on mildly. GHOSTLY WHO stalked two wide, forged an advantage between horses at the three furlong pole,
but was headed by his outer counterpart at the quarter pole, and tired through the lane. STAY HOME trailed early on, advanced inside of tiring foes turning
for home before being bumped by one approaching the furlong pole. SHARP ART was off slowly, raced far off of the pace in the four path around the turn,
was jostled between horses approaching the furlong pole, and failed to make an impact. FLAT LUCKY raced far off of the pace in the five path around the
turn, bumped with inner foes approaching the furlong pole, and failed to factor. HOMEVIEW set the pace along the inside, but was headed by pressing foes
at the three furlong pole, and weakened thereafter. FLIGHT TIME (BRZ) was forwardly placed four wide, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole,
then was eased through the lane, bled, and was vanned off.
