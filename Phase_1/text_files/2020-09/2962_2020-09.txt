shaking clear late. KENYA ROAD stalked the pace rallying to bid abreast rival into upper stretch being carried out a bit and tightened near the eighth pole,

the inside in upper stretch. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF KENYA ROAD AGAINST THE RIDER OF AMERICAN JOEY FOR INTERFERENCE

AMICUS BRIEF never far back lost ground to upper stretch rallying clear six wide late. OSMI SLEW away alertly worked a narrow lead through the turn
dueling inside of rivals in upper stretch ceding late while managing to save place. YOUR MOM KNOWS stalked the pace pressing three deep on the turn,
dueling from mid track in upper stretch, ducked out to the seven path when hit left handed a sixteenth out hanging in the final yards. GRAND DEAL chased
the pace racing inside to upper stretch finishing evenly in the two path. HANLEY bumped at the break played no factor. HARBOR BOY pressed the pace
dueling between horses on the turn fading in upper stretch. LIZARD'S BREATH ducked in steadying at the break. TRUST YOURSELF came in bumping at
the break being outrun after.

FLYING FRANK stalked the pace pressing up to draw even at the quarter pole, went clear in upper stretch being hand ridden through the lane in the three
path. OLD MOUNTAIN LANE moved evenly early rallying to contention on the turn, vying from mid track down the lane made no headway on the winner
holding as a solid second best. HANDSOME HARVE slow early was hustled outside on the turn coming six wide down the lane mustering enough to best
the others. HARD WAY WINNER broke sharply to a clear lead, hooked on the turn would cede to upper stretch fading late on the inside. A J'S MOJO raced
evenly playing no factor. CAJUN CARMELIZED breaking slowly was always outrun. MY TOMMY BOY folded up on the turn.
