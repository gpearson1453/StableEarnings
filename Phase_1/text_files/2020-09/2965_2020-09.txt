Footnotes
BENTLEY'S PALACE set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then held under steady pressure. ZIDIKAI well placed and
outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. SNOWY MORNING stalked the
pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. DAISES OF MAY tracked the pace, saved
ground through the turn, came through inside and could not gain in the lane. FIELD REALITY fractious in the gate, was never involved.

Footnotes
FRONT LINE PAIGE allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid five wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up
late. BEYOND SMART stalked the early pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, shook clear, then was no match for the winner late, while
clearly best of the rest. POINTMAN tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and closed
well for the show. GILGIMESH sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then weakened the final
furlong and held a share. VICTORY L. well placed and outside, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and had
no rally. TAKIN THE SLOROAD passed a tiring rival. SALEAS ran evenly for three quarters and faded.

Footnotes
GOLDEN EMPEROR set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid into the stretch,shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. NOPALITO mid
pack, looped up four wide through the turn, bid five wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up for the place late. SAVE THE DRAMA tracked the
pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. MR. CAT well placed and
outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. I'M A COOL MAN vied for the early lead on the outside,
held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong. TRAVEL TRUE mid pack, looped up three wide
through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and weakened in the drive. POLLARD STAR mid pack, moved up inside through the turn, came through inside
of rivals into the stretch and evened out. AVAST MATEY allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and
moved up. BOBBY V. improved position. PERFECT FORESTER well placed and between rivals, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three
wide into the lane and faded in the drive. ANTEROS was no factor. ALWAALY was never involved.
