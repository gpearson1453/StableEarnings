steady gain, edged ahead and held. SPETTACOLI (ARG) sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, shook
clear, then was outfinished in a good effort. BUGLE BARRY mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane,
evened out, while gaining the show. PREQUALIFIED allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane
and got up for a share. BUFFALO MAX allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid five wide into the lane and could not
