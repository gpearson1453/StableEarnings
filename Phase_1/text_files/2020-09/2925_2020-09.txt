Footnotes
HOT N SPICY LOVE settled off the early pace toward the inside, started a three wide bid nearing the three eighths pole and drew aim into the far turn, took
the nod a furlong out then dug in to move clear mid-stretch and widened the final sixteenth. THE WAYNE FACTOR stalked the pace off the rail then took the
lead into the backstretch, drew briefly clear past the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn but was caught at the eighth
pole, dropped back mid-stretch and had to settle for second best. CARTER'S RUN angled to the outside through the opening turn, started a bid nearing the
three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the seven path then dug in to take third the final yards. CARMELO settled off the pace in the three and four
paths then bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path then flattened the final sixteenth. BACOLI rated the early pace
inside then gave up the lead leaving the second turn, picked up the chase from that point but dropped back past the five sixteenths pole and faded on the
far turn. CAT MOR BRIDGE settled off the pace in the three and four paths the first two turns then moved to the inside at the seven sixteenths pole and
showed little further response.

Footnotes
BE BE BOP engaged in close chase toward the outside through the backstretch, was carried to the seven path nearing the head of the lane but dug in from
there to take over the final strides. I'MOVERTHEMOON was hustled along with the pace and took the lead leaving the quarter pole, contested the edge two
deep on the turn, raced clear inside the eighth pole, and, while steadily encouraged through the lane, was caught the final strides. THE BIG STORM chased
the pace through the backstretch and raced close in the three path of the turn, bore out leaving the turn but dug in to hold onto third. GENESIS G G chased
the pace inside, raced at the rail through the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. GRECIAN ADMIRAL set a pressured pace inside, was caught
leaving the quarter pole, remained close nearest the rail on the turn but dropped back past the eighth pole and weakened. BECOMING SMITTY chased the
pace outside, rounded the turn about the six path and finished evenly. JEN'S ORPHAN chased the pace toward the inside and raced near the rail on the
turn, steadied off the inside flank of The Big Storm mid-stretch and weakened. LUFTI'SBROKENHEART was never a factor. PRINCE MALIK engaged in
close chase two deep while between horses but dropped back into the turn then faded through the turn. GOTTA NIP saved ground on the turn.
