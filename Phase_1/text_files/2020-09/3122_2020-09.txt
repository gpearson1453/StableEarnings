Footnotes
FREEDOM FORCE broke out at the start bumping MUCHO SUNSHINE in tandem with BREES BAYOU who broke inwards, established the front and
showed the way in hand five then four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn, came under pressure from a
pair to the outside and got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home shaking away, edged clear under a drive drifting out
through to the finish despite an off sided stick. KICKIN' KIRBY chased three to four wide down the backstretch before tucking to the inside at the
nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. TRI SAINT
LORENZO chased four then three wide coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, went five wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure
the show honors. WARFRONT FIGHTER six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the pace, tucked four wide through the turn and
advanced to press the leader with seven-sixteenths remaining, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper stretch and
weakened. MUCHO SUNSHINE got bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way and recovered outwards bumping BREES BAYOU into
TIZME BOBBY MCGEE against pressure from the coming inwards CONSTANT QUEST, chased in closest aim of the leader six paths off the inside down
the backstretch before tucking three wide into the turn and advancing in concert with the aforementioned foe to be loosely between foes when prompting the
leader at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. BREES BAYOU broke in at the
start bumping MUCHO SUNRISE in tandem with FREEDOM FORCE, then got bumped between foes after the start when MUCHO SUNRISE recovered
outwards sending a chain of bumps out through to CONSTANT QUEST, chased just off the inside from near the rear, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three wide for home and tired. TIZME BOBBY MCGEE broke out at the start and was bumped by CONSTANT QUEST who recovered
inwards from a stumble and got bumped between foes after the break as pressure came inside from MUCHO SUNRISE, chased three to four wide under a
ride from the five-sixteenths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. CONSTANT QUEST stumbled at the start recovering inwards and
bumped TIZME BOBBY MCGEE ricocheting that foe into BREES BAYOU before the bump came back outside after the start due to pressure from MUCHO
SUNRISE, chased five then four wide under a ride from three furlongs out, cornered five wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LEEWAY sway without apparent mishap, travelled about the chute three wide, stepped onto the backstretch within striking distance of the front runners, slid
into the pocket as the half mile was being rattled off, rode GONE GLIMMERING's cover during the run around the fuller turn, slipped to the outside as the
third fraction was near completion, turned into the lane two wide and under a drive, narrowed in during the ensuing furlong, maintained the momentum
springing from the eighth pole, as a duel with the runner up got ignited, drew on dead even terms in deep stretch then gamely won the bob. GONE
GLIMMERING assumed a forward position after the field had been sent off and running, appeared keen stepping off the chute from along the inside route,
was given some rein and rushed up to take over shortly after the initial split had been posted, showed the way, tailed by MOPOLKA, that rival being several
paths wider, continued to dispute the pace against the same foe on the turn, had the pressure intensify coming up to the quarter pole in the form of
LEEWAY, got set down, left the furlong pole locked in an one one battle with the top one, dug in desperately to an ever-dwindling advantage, got nailed at
the finish line. LITTLE RED FROG brushed after the start, pursued the pace towards the two path during the opening phases, flashed interest leaving the
half mile pole, was sent to the outside spinning into the lane, eventually settling in near path five when done, had a good finish down the center of the course
to secure the show. HURRICANE BREEZE took up position in midpack, raced two to thee wide on the bend, got sent out four wide for the drive, mustered
up a mild response. MOPOLKA forwardly placed, but well off the rail for the first half, was about two to three wide contending for the top after exiting the
backstretch, was more the latter when asked for more at the quarter pole, kept at the task for the next furlong before weakening. MAKE OR BREAK made
slight contact with LITTLE RED FROG right after the start, went on to take up the chase from the two path, was already under a drive by the five-sixteenths
pole, tipped four wide onto the top of the lane, made no impact. BELLA ROSE stepped onto the turn from path two, backed away after completing six
furlongs. DIPPING IN corrected after bobbling to the outside, saved ground for nearly three-quarters, came up empty when placed two wide at the head of
the stretch.

WUSHU WARRIOR bobbled at the start, recovered to establish the front and show the way in hand along the inside safely in front of a trio heads apart just
in behind, remained patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat when challenged through the stretch to
the outside, rebuffed the threat to hold safe to the finish in game fashion. LOCAL HERO coaxed from the gate, raced four then three wide in aim of the front
between foes, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge and latching
on the aforementioned foe a furlong from home, fought on to the finish but was ultimately repelled to the wire while clear of the rest. VICAR'S LEGEND
bumped at the start by PROFESSOR SNAPE who broke outwards, chased three then two wide from near the rear coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the show honors. BUSINESS CYCLE chased just off the inside down the
backstretch, tipped three to four wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the
late stages. REAL DAN chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. DEEP
SEA five then four wide in pursuit from the tail of the field, got coaxed along lightly at the three-eighths, went seven wide for home and passed tired foes.
TALE OF MIST chased two to three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. PROFESSOR
SNAPE broke out at the start bumping VICAR'S LEGEND, chased three then two wide in close aim of the leader among a trio heads apart just in behind,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. MISSLE BOMB forwardly placed five then four wide outside a pair just
in behind the leader, came under a ride at the three-eighths, cornered four to five wide into upper stretch, tired and was placed to a protective hold when
striding gingerly inside the eighth pole and was eased to the finish, then got pulled up after the wire and was subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
LENSTAR grabbed the advantage shortly after the start, remained stationed along the inside route cutting the pace, pulling a bit on the bit on the left side
while pressed along by MAJESTIC DUNHILL, shifted towards the two path for entrance into the stretch and got given his cue, appeared to have been
headed by the aforementioned opponent by the conclusion of the run leading up to and then through the furlong grounds, didn't back off and instead went at
it eye to eye with the second place finisher, gamely came up the victor. MAJESTIC DUNHILL prompted the winner from path two for the opening half, got
cued up swinging one path farther off the rail into the stretch, forged to the front a furlong down the road, albeit by a narrow margin, failed to shake loose of
its gutsy nemesis, saw that rival re-claim the top and had to settle for the place. MIHOS pursued the pace from the rear during the initial stages in path two,
was switched over to a drive by midpoint on the turn, angled four wide into the lane, gained ground in a steadfast manner en route for the show. SOLDADO
two to three wide, was asked for run on the turn, stepped onto the top of the lane and backed away. BUILD TO SUIT sent over to the rail nearing the half
mile pole, got roused soon afterwards, cut the corner into the lane and gave out.

STARTING OVER three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, closed
well through the final furlong to issue a challenge and was up in the final strides to prevail. BREAK BEAT attended the leader to the outside three then two
wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was shaken off a furlong out, ran on digging in
to come again and was up for the place honors in the very last jump. GUNMAN established the front and showed the way rated on the pace just off the
inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in
under late threat and was caught in the last jumps then got nailed on the wire for the place honors. GIMME SOME MO chased along the inside from just off
the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and kept on for the last major share. BAY STREET MONEY four
then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish and was
outkicked. SUMMER TUNE tracked the pace from just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six
wide into upper stretch and offered no response. LOKOYA ROAD three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and weakened. TIZ THE JOURNEY chased three to four wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, went five to six wide into

Footnotes
BLUE GATOR emerged from a tightly-packed group at the break with a prominent position, vied for command to the outside of STORM SHOOTER going
about the task two to three wide on the turn, spun into the lane directly abreast of the nemesis, was given his cue in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole,
went by a rival that had himself switched back to the wrong lead a few strides up the road, steadily edged away from that green rival the remainder of the
way home.. FORTY TWO ACE bumped at the start, took up the chase three wide, was being roused spinning approximately five wide into the lane, steadily
gained ground on the ones to catch, overhauled a green STORM SHOOTER late to procure the place. STORM SHOOTER established the top after an
abbreviated brisk hand ride, showed the way from just off the inside, accompanied by BLUE GATOR one path farther to its outside, came under a ride as
the half was being completed, drifted inward having seemingly reverted back to the wrong lead when tapped right around the right shoulder in the vicinity of
the three-sixteenths marker, got headed, battled onward on near even terms with the winner before weakening late. DEVIOUS MO settled into the two path
after the start, sat within range of the front runners well rated, angled four wide for the drive, made no headway. DOUBLEPOUR sent over to the rail well
before reaching the conclusion of the backstretch, continued to track the pace along it on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, made no impact.
PRODUCTION CREDIT bumped from both sides in the shadow of the starting gate, took the inside route for a good portion of the opening half, got spotted
into the two path at the head of the stretch, had no offering. DANTE'S MAP got set up in the pocket after making contact with another shortly after the start,
faltered after the ground-saving journey that followed. MISERY MASTER sluggish after coming out of the start, required some effort before being
successfully worked onto the inside route, failed to close the gap when hand urged afterwards on the backstretch, rode the rail on the turn too, stepped into
lane, ventured down it having trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SKYE SNOW tracked the pace along the inside in aim of the leader, cut the corner into upper stretch put to urging, had the leader ALL OVER THE MAP
come inwards and was checked and altered off that rival's heels just outside the eighth pole to the three path, showed good courage to rally taking
command in the last jumps to score on the wire. CANARSIE ANGEL three to four wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole as ALL OVER THE MAP drifted in, dug in under a
drive under late threat and was caught in the final strides. ALLEY TO CALVARY five wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors in the very last jump to the wire over a trio latched on to one
another. COREY SCORES tracked the pace along the inside coming under encouragement at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and kept
on for the last major share. STUNNING MUNNINGS off half a beat slow, chased three to four wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch and kept on through to the finish getting headed on the wire for a major share. MO ME MO MY four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at
the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. QUASAR three wide in pursuit early on, tucked inside half a mile from
home, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and improved position with a mild bid. ALL OVER THE MAP coaxed from the gate,
showed the way in hand along the inside, floated to the two path midway on the turn, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under
threat the rider peeking back to the inside and drifted in nearing the eighth pole forcing SKYE SNOW to check and alter course off the inside, got displaced
from command right at that juncture and weakened in the final furlong. HENNI PENNY forwardly placed just off the inside, retreated through the turn coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the drive. AVA K'S GIRL four wide in pursuit from near the rear, got
coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SHANNON'S GIRL two to three wide in pursuit from near the
rear, came under motivation three furlongs from home, swung three to four wide at the head of the stretch and offered no response. STRIKE MAGIC two to
three wide in pursuit from mid pack, got coaxed along midway on the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BOURBON BAY stayed forwardly placed after a clean getaway, was one of a plethora on near even terms with each other in pursuit of UNRELENTING
FORCE proceeding along the backstretch, kicked away from his fellow prominently-placed foes to spar with the runner up during the run around the bend,
doing so approximately three wide, stepped into lane and went on to challenge in earnest from path two a sixteenth later, wore down a stubborn with about
a sixteenth to go and edged away. UNRELENTING FORCE in at the start, grabbed the advantage after the field had been released, moved over to the
inside coming up to the half mile pole, was rated along leading the way, followed within striking distance by a muilti-membered line up of rivals, wound up
with the top one as the primary pursuer after the half had been reeled off, settled in upper stretch and was put to a ride, saw the winner whittle away at the
deficit, got headed in the general area of the sixteenth pole, stayed on with willingness to save second. SIX PERCENT was one of several shying away from
UNRELENTING FORCE in the shadow of the starting gate, took up position in path two, was forced to remain on hold caught in traffic late on the bend,
bumped with BEACH ACCESS turning onto the head of the stretch, tipped into five path right afterwards, gaining racing clearance, displayed good late foot
rallying for the show. FARRAGUT induced to move inward right after the start, underwent a four wide trip, came into the stretch, mustered up a mild
response en route for the final significant slice of the purse. BLACKJACK DAVEY pocketed for six furlongs, tipped into two path early during the stretch run,
faltered. BEACH ACCESS nudged to the inside by the second placer, was then taken in hold when close proximity to that one shortly afterwards, took up
position in path three, stalked the pace, between foes for much of the opening three-quarters, made contact with SIX PERCENT prior to turning into the
stretch, had no rally. DANCERS FOR TOKEN steadied on the chute, spun two wide onto the turn, arrived at its end, wandered out towards path seven in
the stretch. PERPETRATE took up the chase from path two, wedged in between foes for most of the way to the quarter pole, came into the stretch and
tired.

Footnotes
SAYYAAF bumped at the start by TWELFTH LABOUR, who broke inwards, showed the way in hand five then four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn and was patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch roused for the drive, drew away under a drive to prevail. FIG JELLY chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, ran on to battling head to head with
READYFORPRIMETIME before shaking that rival off late to secure the place honors. READYFORPRIMETIME coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace
from the two path, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, shaken off, took the inside route into upper stretch and
ran on knocking heads with the aforementioned foe before losing that battle in the late going while safe for the show honors. HONEY WON'T chased four to
five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch and kept on
through to the finish. GHOUL (BRZ) four then three wide down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter
pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no headway. TWELFTH LABOUR broke in at the start bumping SAYYAAF, chased three then two
wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, went three wide for home and offered no response. PAGLIACCI chased just off the inside until tucked inside half
a mile from home, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths remaining, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response.

Footnotes
HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH gathered after breaking slightly to the outside, departed the backstretch from the path three, kept within range of the contested
pace hand ridden, moved up to the ones to catch after crossing the midway point of the turn, bid as the widest of three beginning a sixteenth later, struck the
front soon afterwards, arrived at the three-sixteenths marker and was called upon for more, gave the desired response, was in possession of a healthy
advantage when geared down for the final seventy yards. LOOKIN TO FLY cut over to the rail on the backstretch, quickened when let out a notch springing
from the five-sixteenths marker, angled towards path four entering the stretch, proved no match rallying for the place. LADY TEUFLESBERG underwent a
three wide pursuit, flattened out in the final furlong and had to settle for the show. ORMA worked out a tuck onto the inside route at the half mile pole,
continued to ride along it, stepped into the lane then narrowed in well enough for the last major check. MENZAMENZ two wide heading for the turn, was
three wide leaving it, gave way. DREAM CHASING off a half length the quickest, vied from path two for command, was forced to undergo the task from
between rivals right around the five-sixteenths pole, got set down as the half was being finished, remained in contention for the lead a little while longer then
backed away. ADORABLE MAYA bumped from both sides in the shadow of the starting gate, raced three wide on the turn, got sent out six wide from upper
to midstretch, improved position. PRINCESS LEIHA scooted to the front end after the break, got guided over to the rail, dueled with DREAM CHASING to
her outside, saw the winner add herself to the pace scenario late on the bend, was roused to no avail after being displaced by HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH a
few jumps later, fell back steadily down the stretch. BONUS BABY broke through the gate, saved ground to no avail afterwards. MIA BEA STAR bumped
after the start, took up position in midpack, was three wide stepping onto the turn, steadied behind a wayward MIA BEA STAR in the general area of the
three-eighths pole, commenced the stretch slightly wider, had no response. GOTTA B BOLD lightly bumped a little ways into the contest, took up the chase
two wide on the turn, shifted into path three in upper stretch, never made its presence felt. PRAIRIE TALES made contact with her next stall neighbors right
after the start, travelled off the inside throughout, got out several paths nearing the three-eighths pole, swung very wide into the stretch under a protective
hold and was allowed to fade away.
