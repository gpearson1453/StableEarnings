career victory. VIX VISION was unhurried early then rallied six wide in upper stretch, closed willingly on the outside and was second best in the end.
MONEY BARON rallied while five wide on the turn and upper stretch making a bid but was no menace. N C C JACK rallied four wide on the turn making a
bid but was outfinished in late stretch. OUR LION KING chased the early pace while inside, made a bid on the turn then faltered. RAPID IMPULSE was
inside and saving ground on the turn then was making a run, tried to angled out off heels at the furlong marker and bumped with CUPID'S STAR then
lacked a late bid. OH SO PLAYFUL rallied three wide in upper stretch then was bumped in mid stretch by CUPID"S STAR and faltered in late stretch.
SINFUL MOVES raced three wide on the turn and was no factor. CUPID'S STAR was hustled along from the gate to chased the pace while inside, raced
two wide in the stretch then was bumped soundly by RAPID IMPULSE and shut off and taken up sharply at the furlong marker and stopped.
