stages. TIZEMOTIONALGOLD chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but was no match for the winner in the
late stages. REGAL PASSAGE chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the stretch run. TAKE
CHARGE PATTI raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. BETTER WITH AGE was unhurried early on,
raced off the rail into the lane and improved position in the stretch. CONOLOWAY was never a threat. URBANA was never a factor and vanned off after the

MIDNIGHT BALLERINA stalked three wide, inched closer turning for home to produce a three wide bid at the quarter pole under confident handling, offered
a good kick when called upon in upper stretch, surged clear of inner foes approaching the furlong pole, then held LITTLESTITIOUS's rail bid at bay through
the late stages under confident handling with a measured margin. LITTLESTITIOUS stalked from just behind leader and from the pocket around the turn,
loomed while waiting racing room turning for home, split the leaders two wide at the three sixteenths pole as MIDNIGHT BALLERINA forged an advantage,
then sustained a rail bid through the lane and stayed on well inside of that foe through the final furlong, but was second best. BEL FIORE broke outwardly,
took the turn off of the pace in the two path, then shifted four wide in midstretch, and produced a mild late kick to pass foes for a minor reward. MUCHO
MACHO MOMMA bobbled a bit a the start, prompted the pace two wide and between horses, forged a narrow advantage passing the quarter pole as
MIDNIGHT BALLERINA made a bid, but proved no match for that foe approaching the furlong pole, and tired. MALLOY tracked from midpack four wide, but
failed to make a bid. DIVINE COMEDY tracked from midpack inside of a rival while in the two path around the turn, and failed to factor. SWEET MARY LOU
hesitated at the start, raced far off of the pace two to three wide around the turn before shifting five wide turning for home, but failed to make an impact.
TROUBLE MAKING set the pace along the inside, but was headed by multiple foes at the quarter pole, and weakened. JEWEL AZUL was crowded at the
start due to an inner foe breaking out, saved ground far off of the pace, but failed to factor. EXAGGERATEDINCOME was outrun. A LITTLE FLYER was
distanced around the turn, and eased through the lane, then walked off.

Footnotes
MY MAN FLINTSTONE broke sharp, dueled for the lead outside of JESSUP down the backstretch and around the turn before forging a narrow advantage
from that foe passing the quarter pole, then firmly held that margin through the lane over his inner game counterpart. JESSUP dueled for the lead inside of
MY MAN FLINSTONE, held a narrow advantage around the turn, but was headed by that foe in upper stretch, then fought on gamely through the lane, but
failed to regain even terms his outer counterpart, while well clear of show. PERUVIAN BOY stalked the leading duelers from the three path around the turn,
but failed to produce a bid, chased those foes through the lane, and was clearly best of the rest. GROVE DADDY saved ground off of the pace, but to no
avail. INTIMIDATION bumped mildly with an outer foe at the start, raced far off the pace in the two path around the turn, and failed to factor. JURISDICTION
tracked from midpack two to three wide, and was no factor. BIGMANCAN bobbled and bumped an inner foe at the start, raced far off of the pace three to
four wide, but was outrun.

Footnotes
TIZ OUR TURN set the slow pace along the inside, held an advantage from LUCK OF THE DRAW around the far turn, shook loose from that foe in upper
stretch, then widened his margin under driving pressure before being geared down approaching the wire. BOX OF CHOCOLATES stalked along the inside,
tipped out three wide in upper stretch, but only produced a mild kick, proved no match for the leader in midstretch, then held place from inner and outer foes
through the late stages. FRONT MAN settled off of the pace two wide around the first turn, shifted to the three, then four, path around the far turn before
shifting five wide in upper stretch, and produced a mild grind through the lane. BEAVER HAT saved ground around both turns in midpack, waited for racing
room turning for home before committing to a rail rally in upper stretch, produced a bid for place inside of foes through midstretch, but was outfinished by
outer rivals and just missed show. FRA MAURO saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, but shifted four wide into the far turn, then five to six wide
in upper stretch, but failed to rally. LUCK OF THE DRAW prompted the leader two wide, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch. MAJOR
ATTRACTION stalked the pace in the three path, got a bit keen around the first turn before settling under a tight hold down the backstretch, but came up
empty when asked turning for home, and tired between horses in upper stretch before shying mildly in midstretch. OLYMPIC ROMP was outrun.

Footnotes
SEEKING SECA stalked along the inside around the turn, squeezed through a narrow opening inside of the pace setter in upper stretch, forged an
advantage approaching the furlong pole, then held tenaciously through the final stages. SPITZ set the pace along the inside, cleared off into the turn, but
was headed by an inner surging foe approaching the furlong pole, fought back gamely through the late stages, but was denied and missed. WILL'S
SECRET advanced from off of the pace two to three wide and between horses around the turn, but was blocked behind a wall of foes turning for home,
finally found clear racing room approaching the furlong pole after shifting five wide, and offered a mild belated kick for a minor reward. LADY COMMANDER
was off slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, advanced inside of foes turning for home to forge show from outer foes in upper stretch, shifted to the three
path, but chased the leaders home while hanging on her left lead, and got nailed on the wire for show. MAKING PROGRESS bumped with an inner foe at
the start, saved ground far off of the pace, and produced a mild inside rally through the lane without threatening the leaders. MONTGOMERY PARK raced
forwardly placed five to four wide, held striking position turning for home, but was outfinished through the lane. LEN LO LADY raced far off of the pace two
wide and between horses around the turn, shifted five wide in midstretch, and passed tired foes. SUITE MADAM BLUE prompted the pace setter from the
outside early on, but failed to keep pace with that foe in the turn, then weakened between horses turning for home. TARGETED RETURN raced forwardly
placed four wide and between horses early on, but steadily lost early position and settled off of the pace at the half mile pole, then took the turn in the five
path and failed to factor. SUPER SPORT brushed the gate at the start, stalked the pace three wide and between horses, crept closer turning for home, but
weakened at the furlong pole. RYAN'S ROCKET raced far off of the pace three wide around the turn, and was outrun.
