NOVEL SQUALL stalked the pace, rallied outside entering the stretch, took over passing the eighth pole and drew clear under urging. MINETTA raced two
wide off the pace, checked midway on the turn, came five wide into the lane, rallied late outside and was along for the place spot. DOUBLE WHOPPER set
the pace on the inside racing with clear early lead, showed the way into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. WALK ME HOME was off slowly,
raced four wide early, settled three wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. YELLOWSTONE GIRL raced off the pace, inside on
the turn, came three wide into the lane and had no rally. WAIT FOR NAIROBI raced off the pace, had an inside trip and failed to threaten. TANQURETTE
stumbled at the start, raced three wide early and was outrun. LAZARETTE pressed the pace in the early stages, chased on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
BETCHA cleared off entering the first turn, set the pace racing a bit off the inside, dueled inside a rival on the far turn, responded when roused turning for
home, dug in gamely through a long stretch drive and got the nod over ELUSIVE JUSTICE at the wire. ELUSIVE JUSTICE raced four wide early, then
pressed the pace, dropped back a bit, bid three wide on the far turn, dug in gamely outside of BETCHA in the final furlong, battled determinedly to the wire
and just missed. CARMELLA KEY raced close up on the inside, saved ground on the far turn and rallied mildly on the rail to best the others.
SENTIMENTALJOURNEY was bumped at the start, raced four wide early, stalked four wide on the backside, bid two wide on the far turn and weakened in
the lane. MYSTICAL JUSTICE raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and tired. BREWSKY raced off the pace
inside, angled out entering the stretch and did not factor. WILADENE was bumped at the start, raced three wide on the first turn, tracked between rivals and
gave way.
