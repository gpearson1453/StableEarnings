Footnotes
MAJESTIC CAFE broke sharply to duel for the early advantage with STANDING ROCK while racing three-wide, opened a clear lead into the stretch and
drew off. BALIUS chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain on the winner in the drive. CRITERION was reserved just off the
leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the lane and finished evenly late. STANDING ROCK was away in good order to dispute the
pace with the winner from the inside and weakened after going a half. MARK MY WORD broke out, lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn, angled in
with a furlong to run and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
PIN UP LADY lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch, moved between rivals with a furlong to run, gained
command and quickly drew off. STREETLIGHTROMANCE settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, could not match strides with
the winner late but finished well to hold the place. SHE'S AN EAGLE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the
fore in tandem with the winner in mid-stretch and gave way through the final sixteenth. BELL OF RAINIER showed no early speed, raced six-wide through
the turn and failed to gain late. DOUBLESHOTOFHEAVEN pressed the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. SALTY LITTLE LASS
was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail and weakened after a half. ROSIES BABY pressed the pace from between foes, moved
three-wide through the turn and weakened.

RIGGSKI settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, reached the fore in tandem with COLEINATOR with a furlong to run, vied
with that rival and was up at the wire. COLEINATOR was away alertly to duel for the lead MAGIC MAHOGANY while racing three-wide, responded when
challenged by the winner in mid-stretch, vied and just missed. STANLEY RYDER showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled
out into the stretch and finished with some late energy. AWAY HE GOES raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, saved ground through the
second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. MAGIC MAHOGANY broke sharply to dispute the pace from the inside and weakened after
going three-quarters. MOLAF was forwardly placed from off the rail throughout and gradually weakened. SILVER ATTACHE was off slow, raced four-wide
through the turn and did not reach contention.

PEACE PRINCE pressed the pace of BLUE BUTTERFLY while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and held off the closing
HE'S BANDIDO to prevail. HE'S BANDIDO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and
finished with good late energy. BLUE BUTTERFLY broke in, set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin into the stretch and gave way
through the final furlong. ILUVADACOAST raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. HALO HERO was off
slow, lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and did not offer a bid. DOWNTHEMIDDLE DAN was pushed in at the
start, raced just off the leaders and weakened. PARKER'S CROWN was off slow, lagged far back early and did not menace.

Footnotes
SHOE GAME lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore in tandem with her stable-mate,
vied with that rival through a prolonged drive and proved best. SEMI SWEET raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the second turn, offered a
bid in mid-stretch, vied but could not get by her stable-mate in the drive. LADY CAMPBELL was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear
margin nearing the eleven-sixteenths pole and gave way after going six furlongs. JUDICIAL pressed the pace from the inside for three-quarters and gave
way. GAZING raced four-wide through both turns, race just off the leaders and lacked the needed rally. FORTUNE IN SILK chased the leaders while racing
three-wide for five furlongs and weakened. ANNA LEE ENCORE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
