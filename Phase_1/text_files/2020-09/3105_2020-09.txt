Footnotes
SHORT POUR pinched at the start, was maneuvered to the outside, travelled primarily three wide on the clubhouse bend, quickened as the first fraction
was being finalized, enough so as to shortly afterwards confront the pacesetter, rated well prompting that opponent, closed the gap after three-quarters had
been reeled off, came up to the three-sixteenths pole and challenged in earnest, grabbed away the advantage inside the eighth pole and edged away. VIP
NATION lost her footing springing from the starting gate, then had the rider take hold making light contact with another right afterwards, launched herself to
the top with a three wide run, tucked closer to the rail then went on to rate kindly showing the way from path two, got guided onto the inside route for the
beginning of the run around the far turn, felt the presence of the winner by the quarter pole, settled onto the top of the lane and was given her cue,
relinquished with slightly under a furlong to go, held on to save second. OUT OF TROUBLE reserved along the outside in midpack, raced three wide on the
second bend, was about as wide entering the stretch, inched up, missed the place. PECATONICA got set up in the pocket, kept pace with the front runners
after being let out a notch departing the backstretch, was switched over to a brisker hand ride in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths marker, was making some
headway when forced to steady off VIP NATION in midstretch, got re-roused and got going once again, venturing on with some headway, although probably
not enough so as to overhaul the eventual winner, was forced to idle for a second time in deep stretch, tipped towards the two path for the last few jumps,
then completed the event, appearing to have some foot remaining.. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS gathered after coming out at the start, raced from off the
inside, appeared keen for a good portion of the trip on the backstretch, pursued the pace three wide on the turn, angled into path four for the drive,
becoming the widest, had no rally. ELEGANT ZIP the sharpest breaking from the gate, rode the rail, cut the corner under a drive, had no response and
faltered.

Footnotes
CLASSIC COLORS just off the inside near the rear of the field, got patiently handled until set down spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up
a good kick to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command inside the sixteenth marker, tussled to the finish with the runner up inching away
late to ultimately prevail on the wire. LYN B tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, tipped to the two path through the far turn and was let out
spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, took over command just outside the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and was collared inside the sixteenth
pole, fought on to the finish while clear of the rest. MENDHAM just off the pace tracking along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole before
being roused cornering just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish to improve position for the show honors. B C BELLE established
the front just after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, remained on hold until roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive and was caught just outside the eighth pole, dug in and weakened in the late stages. CARA'S DREAMER settled just off the inside in closest
aim of the leader, remained patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong. FROSTED
BOURBON broke out at the start and was away last, saved ground at the tail of the field until tipped three wide half a mile from home, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. COSMIC KITTEN two to three wide in pursuit, got placed to
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. ROSEY'S PEACH two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. QUARANTINA chased two to three wide from near the rear under a ride
from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and was unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
EMPTY TOMB With the field sent onto the Main Track at 3MTP, EMPTY TOMB was allowed to ease back during the opening phases, slipped off the inside
route and into the three path by the conclusion of the backstretch, steadily advanced towards the ones to catch, got floated approximately five wide by an
errant WINSTON'S CHANCE as they spun into the stretch, narrowed in nevertheless, emerging at the beginning of the final furlong possessing a slim lead,
saw BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON whittle away at the deficit, got worked towards the inside route in the final stages, briefly stepped onto the second place
finisher's path, leading that one 's rider to lightly steady the mount, got corrected and went on to hold sway. BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON took up residence
along the rail after the start, was stuck in traffic approaching the quarter pole, saw the pilot commit to taking a much wider route for optimal racing clearance
entering the stretch only to check and deftly scuttle that strategy to instead proceed along a freshly-created open corridor in the two path, inched up,
appeared not being up to the task of going by the winner when steadied while in a bit tight in the final seventy yards, had no trouble saving second.
WINSTON'S CHANCE remained forwardly placed after a good beginning, prompted the pace from path two, sputtered towards the fourth one when cued up
for the drive, failed to claim the advantage, weakened into the show slot. LEGIT pursued the pace from the two path, came under a ride by the half mile
pole, got sent out six wide stepping into the lane, had no response and backed away. KINGMEISTER cut over to the inside after establishing the top, rated
well carving out the pace, shadowed by WINSTON'S CHANCE to his outside, came under heavier pressure nearing the quarter pole, got let out, succumbed
soon afterwards and retreated. Following a Stewards' inquiry focusing on the winner in deep stretch, the result was allowed to stand and the race was
declared official.

Footnotes
MICROMILLION three to four wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and was briefly taken in hand off the heels of a rival
near the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish to close stoutly outside issuing a challenge through the final
furlong and was just up in the very last jump to prevail by a sliver. KEPT WAITING tracked the pace along the inside, tipped to the two path at the
seven-sixteenths and moved through a seam between foes to pressure the leader in tandem with PLINK FREUD to her outside, took over command near
the quarter pole and was roused spinning to cut the corner clearing the former leader into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in
under lone threat and was nailed in the very last stride to the finish. MEMORIES ETERNAL saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under
encouragement at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and closed well to secure the show honors knocking heads to the finish with
UNICORN SALLY to prevail on the line. UNICORN SALLY just off the inside near the rear of the field, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under
coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and closed well dueling with the aforementioned foe to the finish but was ultimately
nosed on the wire for the show honors in a good effort. WOMEN NOT EASY tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing bidding
at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the stretch. PLINK FREUD pulled early on and vied loosely between foes from
the two path, backed off six and a half furlongs from home, tipped three wide through the far turn advancing on the front once more this time in concert with
KEPT WAITING to prompt the leader three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. GO ZAPPEM vied inside a pair early on before emerging in tandem with SWEET BREEZE six and a half furlongs out, took over sole command
with five and a half furlongs to go briefly showing the way alone before coming under pressure three furlongs out from a pair, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, yielded the front near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside for home, then tired in the stretch. MIZZEN THE MARK five then four wide
in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. BOSTON GIRL three wide early on,
tipped out five wide at the five furlong marker, tucked four wide through the turn coming under urging three furlongs out, went seven to eight wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. SARATOGA LULLABY chased just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and faded, continued
just off the inside for home and tired. MIA CALIA got away to an awkward beginning with her front legs in the air, chased three wide under a ride from the
three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. SWEET BREEZE vied from the five then four path with a pair to her inside, shook away in
tandem with GO ZAPPEM six and a half furlongs out before being headed by that rival with five and a half furlongs remaining, chased three wide through
the far turn in retreat coaxed along, swung four wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
SCARF IT DOWN at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, sat parked out four wide on the turn, increased his presence after three-quarters
had been completed, got roused stepping onto the top of the lane, forged to the front for good during the ensuing furlong, steadily added to the margin, kept
busy to the end. LATER CAT attained a prominent position after making light contact with EDEN RIDGE right after the field had been sent off and running,
vied from path three as the widest of a trio beginning from the general area of the seven-eighths marker, saw that dispute morph into an one on one contest
by midpoint on the turn, with the nemesis now being the eventual winner, was more in path two as their tussle spilled into the lane, fell back reluctantly by
the start of the last eighth, stayed on for second. AUTOSTRADE brushed at the start, settled into midpack, underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn,
angled into the five path for the stretch run, went on to secure the show. MILLS strung out along the overland route, lacked a closing punch. DEALIN'
STELEN two wide stepping onto the turn, was three wide exiting it, made no impact. EDEN RIDGE loped along three wide on the turn, swung out five wide
into the lane, never made his presence felt. NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY saved ground to the quarter pole, got steered out five wide from upper to midlane,
failed to menace. FINANCIAL FREEDOM disputed the pace stationed in the two path from midway on the backstretch until midway on the turn, gave way.
CALIFORNIA NIGHT rushed up after the start, argued from the rail as the innermost of a three for a half beginning from seven-eighths marker, stopped to a
walk, then after after being pulled up in the shadow of the finish line, walked off the track without need of outside assistance.

Footnotes
Following a ten minute delay when a late scratch at the gate required the assistance of the horse ambulance, SECRET LOVE broke in at the start and was
corrected, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch from just off the pace, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just outside the eighth pole, then drew clear to the finish kept to task. SIESTA
KEW broke out at the start, prompted the pace five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn, took over
narrow command near the quarter pole and was set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and got collared just outside the eighth
pole, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to preserve the place honors. BYHUBBYHELLOMONEY chased five then four wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. CHILLY CHOOS broke out at the
start bumping TANGERINE DREAM and came under coaxing, showed the way two to three wide in hand and under some pressure to the outside before
tucking inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole headed narrowly for the front, spun just off the inside for home and
weakened in the final furlong. SWEETER broke in at the start, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn
placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, went five wide into upper stretch and tired. U SHOULD B DANCING a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start
necessitating reload, broke in at the start bumping TANGERINE DREAM, chased just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, angled four to five
wide for home and tired. DREAMS STILL WILD chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide into upper
stretch and faltered. TANGERINE DREAM got bumped between foes at the start, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide
through the turn, angled five wide for home and made no impact. TEN PLAGUES broke a half a beat slow and was bumped at the start by SWEETER, who
broke inwards, chased six then five wide down the backstretch and through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung six to seven wide for home
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DUNCASTLE retained the advantage after breaking on top, edged away MCERIN and cut over to the rail, showed the way, well rated and with the
aforementioned rival in attendance in the two path, got cued up settling onto the head of the stretch, dug in with good determination to preserve the
decision. KITTEN'S CAT guided into the pocket, sat within range of the top one, came under a stronger handling cutting the corner into the lane, willingly
won the place. IAN GLASS forwardly placed three wide, got turned loose spinning into the lane, battled with KITTEN'S CAT for second, came up the
vanquished one. GHOST GIANT quickly spotted along the rail, was still on it entering the stretch, mustered up a mild response to claim the final significant
slice of the purse. MCERIN vied for control from path two matched up with the winner during the run around the bend, weakened during the stretch drive.
SQUARE SHOOTER underwent a four wide journey for a good portion of the opening half, lacked the needed response. OUTRAGEOUS BET took up the
chase two wide, was on hold waiting behind others late on the bend, got sent out into path six from upper to midstretch, had no rally. DIRTY strung out four
wide on the turn, got fanned out six wide after entering the stretch, never made his presence felt. ETHAN HUNT three wide onto the turn, angled five wide
leaving it, had no offering. PREAMBLE sighted two wide at the top of the turn, was through after going a half. HONORABLE HERO raced along the overland
route for the initial half, was moved out into path seven after stepping into the lane, maintaining its status of being just about the widest of all throughout,
was never in it.

Footnotes
LOGIC N REASON broke on top and retained the advantage, cut over towards the inside route, threw down a pair of pedestrian splits during the opening
half, saw GOGO SHOES hitch up for a few jumps on the backstretch, flicked off that opponent when let out a notch in response, continued to save ground
leading the way, under light coaxing on the far turn, got set down spinning into the lane when put to the test by the second place finisher, gamely fended off
the stiff challenge and edged away. GOGO SHOES prompted the winner from path two, challenged in earnest as they turned into the stretch, battled hard
but couldn't go by. CAPITAL STRUCTURE (GB) pursued the top twosome during the initial stages, tipped into the three path after entering the second
bend, was just as wide heading home, rallied mildly. CRYSTALLE rode the rail until the half mile pole, was one farther off the inside travelling on the far turn,
fanned out into path four from upper to midstretch becoming the widest of all, lacked the necessary stretch. QUEENS EMBRACE faltered off a
ground-saving journey.

Footnotes
MIND OF GOLD broke in at the start forcing the slower breaking HONORABLE DREAMS to be taken in hand, pressed the pace two to three wide in hand,
came under light coaxing at the quarter and swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take over command nearing the eighth pole, edged clear under a
drive to prevail. CRICK two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered
up a mild kick to secure the place honors clear of the rest. MADAM DEPUTY showed the way in hand along the inside, came under pressure through the
turn from a pair to the outside and got placed to coaxing in response just past the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home under threat and briefly
headed for the front, dug in under a drive, got collared outside the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages while able to preserve the show honors on the
wire. VITANZA four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
LEMONCELLA chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. LOVE ME
TOMORROW prompted the pace from the outside five then four wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six to seven wide into upper stretch
and tired. OAK CREEK CANYON hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch
and tired. SAINTE MERE EGLISE stumbled at the start conceding two to three lengths to the front, chased four to five wide under coaxing from three
furlongs out, went six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. HONORABLE DREAMS broke a half a beat slow and was steadied at the start losing her
lane to the breaking inwards MIND OF GOLD and conceded three to four lengths to the front before settling into stride, tipped out seven paths off the inside
down the backstretch, steadily tucked into the turn striding a bit green to the inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed throughout.
