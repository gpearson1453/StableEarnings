Footnotes
LIGHTHOUSE tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, drove past with a quick kick and cleared the field near the eighth pole and held
safely in the final stages. MISS J MCKAY stalked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, rallied in the stretch and finished willingly in the late
stages. KIMARI was a bit slow at the break and raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane, rallied in the stretch and finished willingly.
OUTBURST (GB) raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane with a belated gain in the stretch run. LUCREZIA trailed the field early on, was off
the rail into the lane with a mild gain in the stretch drive. BREDENBURY (IRE) tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late
in the stretch run. SHE'S MY TYPE (FR) was never a threat. EVIL LYN set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and gave way late. ENOLA GAY was
never a factor. SHE'S SO SPECIAL was through after a half. FINITE was through early.
