outward then settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn but failed to menace. SEEMEE lost his path leaving the gate, raced in mid pack, was
hustled two-wide on the turn then finished gamely in vain. HESATHRILLER pressed the pace, chased three-wide on the turn but evened out in the final

three and four-wide on the far turn then finished under a determined drive. WHERE'S ANTHONY stalked the pace, was hustled along the rai on the turn,
rallied gamely but lost position in deep stretch. LETTHEBIGHOSSROLL settled in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the final turn
then finished evenly. CANMORE pressed the pace, bid at the top of the stretch, dueled, led briefly but was passed and gave chase. THE BOSS FACTOR,
in range, was hustled angling out from the rail to three-wide late turn then finished gamely through the stretch. GLENVILLE GARDENS, off slowly and
settled well back, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn then rallied willingly, but late. PICCADILLY BEAU, in mid pack early, was hustled from off the
pace on the far turn and was game but not a threat in the stretch. MARTEN RIVER set a reserved pace, was headed upper stretch and faded. GORGEOUS

Footnotes
A LITTLE VOODOO began awkwardly, was five to four wide stalking the lead through the first turn, stayed four wide down the backside, cruised to the front
while four to three wide midway on the far turn, cleared off while well off the rail turning for home and held safe while never close to the fence. D'S SOUL
had a rail trip throughout, waited for room midway on the second turn, was in tight turning for home getting up inside a tiring foe, closing well late but the
winner was gearing down, well in front. BENEVIDA sat in mid pack along the rail, moved up late backstretch to be in behind the leaders, angled out to go by
a tiring foe at the quarter pole and was a clear second in upper stretch but was outkicked by a runner to his inside late, settling for the show spot. GIZMO'S
PRINCESS settled off the pace inside, rallied two to five wide coming out of the second turn and was in tight for a second turning for home, split rivals at the
sixteenth pole and ran on well for a minor award. LONDONDERRY trailed into the far turn before circling around to be six wide at the quarter pole, levelling
off in the final sixteenth while still wide. FROST DANCE was off the pace two to three wide around the first turn, stayed two to four wide into range turning
for home but faltered down the stretch. GLORIOUS GIZMO was fractious in the gate, gunned to the front and dueled with a rival, opened a lead into the far
turn but was passed easily by the winner midway on that bend, tiring noticeably in the final furlong. SILENT CHARITY was four to three wide stalking the
two duelers around the first turn, in range three wide on the second turn but had nothing left for the stretch. ASHA IRONBORN pressed the leader into the
second turn but backed up from midway on that turn to the wire.

SHOWBIZ LADY stalked the pace, bid at the top of the stretch and drove clear then was all out to hold. ONEZY'S DREAM raced in mid pack, closed
three-wide on the turn, rallied, and gained steadily to the end and just missed. DOWN WITH BROWN showed early speed, set a reserved pace, was
headed upper stretch and chased to the end. PETITE AMIE, away slowly and off the early pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then finished
gamely to no avail. DONT GET SMART got away slowly and raced from off the pace, closed two and three-wide through the turn then rallied gamely
outside. MUNCH AND CRUNCH broke slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn then finished evenly. I'M A GINGER raced in mid
pack, chased hard three-wide late turn but evened out in the final 16th. CONQUEST RAPIDUNO settled in mid pack, saved ground on the turn, chased into
the stretch but never reached contention. TRIPLE SEVENS, away slowly, settled off the pace, rode the rail on the turn then faced traffic in the stretch and
evened out. MUNNINGS BEACH stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail through the turn but tired upper stretch.

Footnotes
STORMY EGBERT led early, set a reserved pace, widened when asked upper stretch then finished under a hand ride. RED ASTAIRE stalked the pace,
came two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. ANIMAL KRACKERS was bumped by FINAL STRIKE at the start and passed
it on to KING OF THE RING then settled in mid pack, came two-wide through the turn, moved to the rail upper stretch and rallied gamely. FINAL STRIKE
broke outward and bumped ANIMAL KRACKERS, raced from off the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn but was lugging in through the stretch and
evened out late. KING OF THE RING was bumped by ANIMAL KRACKERS leaving the gate and was immediately pinched back, settled off the pace,
closed five-wide on the turn then rallied from the outside. SOCIETY MISFIT stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail late turn then flattened out mid
stretch. PRINCE MARTHEUS settled off the early pace then closed to mid pack later on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn but lacked a response in
the stretch. SWEET LITTLE ARTIE raced from off the pace, was hustled three-wide to the rail on the turn but never reached contention. CREATIVE FORCE
was hustled a bit early turn but was beginning to ease approaching the top of the top stretch, did not finish the course and walked off.
