Footnotes
PICKING ROSES stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn,
responded when asked and was well clear while kept to task. CARBONATED unhurried early from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch,
responded when sat down for the drive but could not reach the winner. MAHALO JOHN drifted out into the first turn, was up close from the outside, chased
the pace up the backstretch, reached a forward position for the drive but could not keep pace while holding the show. ONE KING CAT well placed from the
inside, held a forward position entering the drive, responded but was too late. TASTE FOR TALENT broke sharp from the outside, drifted out into the first
turn, gained a clear margin, dueled up the backstretch, remained engaged entering the second turn but had nothing left. MALLARD'S BRO could only
improve position. CAP ROCK MINER up close early from the inside, faded in the drive. ROYAL ROCKET was no factor. GRAND ARGUMENT was no
threat. LINDANTE drifted out into the first turn and gave way.

Footnotes
RUE LALA up close early from the outside, inched closer entering the turn, gained the margin entering the drive, opened a clear margin at the eighth pole
and proved much the best while in hand the final furlong. INAWIC chased the early pace from the inside, crept closer entering the turn, responded but was
no match for the winner while clearly second best. KENTUCKY SAGA was off a step slow, advanced outside through the turn, responded when asked and
closed with a rush for the show. ABIGAIL'S BEAUTY chased the early pace outside, remained forward but could not keep pace. ANNIE SULLIVAN could
only improve position. HOTMOLLY was no factor. SINGING N' PRAYING chased the early pace outside and faded. EVE'S DELIGHT had a steady fade.
KUHLKE was no threat. LOUISIANA'S HOPE broke sharp from the outside, gained a clear early margin, dueled through the turn then faded in the drive.
CALLING DIBBS was never close. MAYBE BABY showed little.

VERONICA'S DREAM well placed early from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded to pressure to duel through the drive and inched
clear late. YES GORGEOUS pressed the early pace from the inside, dueled through the turn, dropped back slightly at the eighth pole, responded and was
just up for the place. ARCTIC PEACE dueled from the inside early, battled through the turn, remained engaged for the drive but could only hold the show.
HONEST WOMAN broke out at the start, was forced back, recovered to chase the pace up the backstretch, responded entering the drive and rallied late.
FLASH HANDS chased the early pace outside but came up empty in the drive. ORETTA was no factor. DREAMY ART was no threat. SUSAN JONES
dueled from the outside and faded. ROCK THE JUKEBOX had a steady fade.

Footnotes
ZYPTO stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, gained the margin and held sway. SUNSET SEVEN forced the early
pace from the outside, inched closer entering the turn, responded but was no match while clearly second best. FLASH ATTACK chased the early pace from
the inside, inched closer entering the turn, responded and rallied late for the show. IT'S A SWEET ONE forced the early pace inside, responded but was too
late. EARNEDNEVERGIVEN could only improve position. FROSTED BLING dueled from the inside and tired. STUPIFY dueled from the outside and tired.
STICK had a steady fade. WHERE'S RUFUS broke well from the outside, stopped soon after the start, was eased and vanned off.
