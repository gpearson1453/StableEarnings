Footnotes
VIVACE was inside early on then taken back off the pace, rallied two wide on the far turn and was in a strong drive, gamely dug in throughout the stretch
and after a determined stretch drive proved best in the end. ROLLIN RIVER stalked the pace then rallied three wide on the far turn, gained a slim lead in
upper stretch but was outfinished in deep stretch. CIAK was allowed to settled while inside, made a bid three wide in the stretch and finished well in the end.
UNO RIVER was unhurried early then rallied four wide in upper stretch, was gaining ground and finished well in late stretch. JOHNNY LONGBOAT was
allowed to settled then rallied two wide in the stretch but was no menace in the end. JUB set the early pace while two wide, drew off on the backstretch but
weakened in the stretch drive. SQUIGGET was slow in the early going then was no factor in the stretch. DOCTOR HENNY raced three wide on the
backstretch, was used up then gave way. BIG BAD FRED was through early and stopped.
