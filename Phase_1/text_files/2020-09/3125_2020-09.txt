Footnotes
SHE LIKES TO PARTY assumed command early, took pressure through the backstretch inside of BELLS AND WHISTLES, saved ground through the final
turn, turned back challenge from TEMPLE OF ZOOM and drew away. TEMPLE OF ZOOM stalked the pace from the two path, lodged a rail bid into the lane
but was unable to stall the winner and finished clearly second best. AWESOME GIGI chased four to five wide through the backstretch and lacked a
response when called upon. BELLS AND WHISTLES pressed SHE LIKES TO PARTY through the backstretch, was unable to move on with the eventual
winner and tired.

Footnotes
TACTICAL EDGE settled well off the pace towards the outside, advanced quickly inside approaching the quarter pole, swept the lead and held safely.
REBATE SHOP angled inward towards the rail leaving the backstretch, swung out entering the lane, hung outside near the three sixteenth then closed late
getting along in time for place. SPIN A TALE chased the pacesetters while five wide through the backstretch, rallied two wide into the stretch and got by for
show. PRINCESS PONTI dueled outside of SUSIE DERKINS leaving the backstretch, drove four to five wide into the lane and was edged out late.
QUEEN'S PARK broke awkwardly then trailed through the backstretch, launched an all out bid but failed to menace in the drive. SUSIE DERKINS dueled
while three to four wide off the rail, matched strides through the final turn with PRINCESS PONTI but had nothing left in reserve for the drive when called
upon. MI CHICA tracked outside early and faded through the stretch. MIXED MEDIA always outrun.

ROX STAR WILDCAT vied four wide in the early stages, gained advantage leaving the backstretch and held under steady pressure. STEAL A KISS allowed
to settle early then raced wide into the far turn, chased three wide into the lane, kept on gradually inside but was unable to reach the winner. CLASSIC
TARTAN vied between foes early, shifted out to the three path entering the far turn, chased the eventual winner, was gaining late but was no threat to the
winner. SOPHIE MCTROPHY vied inside early, shifted out to the four wide leaving the backstretch, was set down for the drive but was unable to improve
contention through the stretch. BETTY DO IT trailed wide through the backstretch, lugged in approaching the stretch under right handed encouragement
then was steadied and passed tiring. HI HO PICOLO chased inside then raced in close quarters nearing the half and retired early. ROLL WITH ME chased
three wide and lacked a serious bid. DANS LA ROSE chased wide and was done early.

BANG ON contested the early pace inside, saved ground through the far turn, was asked to quicken approaching the quarter pole, overtook the lead from
SHOTTHRUTHEHEART and was under steady pressure through the drive. SHOTTHRUTHEHEART sat just off the pace while three wide, moved up to
challenge the lead at the three eighths marker then gained a slim advantage over BANG ON, was overtaken into the lane and kept on gamely but was
unable to stall the winner. LIGHTENING ANNA chased wide into the backstretch, gained closer order through the far turn, chased the leader into the stretch
under urging but was no threat and finished best of rest. EXPLORER BILL settled well off the pace and passed tiring. DANCING WILLIE vied early between,
dropped back leaving the backstretch and tired. EL DORADO STORM under a strong hold early from the four path, drifted in nearing the three sixteenth and
gave way. DAD'S LEGACY fractious then dismounted rider in gate and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
IGNITE THE MOON broke alertly then cleared the lead, responded to challenged from LADY BENGEL and was clear driving. LADY BENGEL sent for
speed, chased the leader through the turn, moved up closer to IGNITE THE MOON but was no match for the winner. ORANGE THEORY chased four wide
leaving the backstretch, moved up closer but was unable to improve through the stretch. MR. FALLON advanced along the rail into the final turn and lacked
a closing response under heavy urging. OLD DOUBLE DIAMOND rallied belatedly. CHILLIN WITH CHIP chased five wide early and showed a mild interest
late. MOVILLE trailed early, circled wide into the lane and lodged a mild bid. DOCSLASTJOKE hustled early, chased through the turn and gave way mid
stretch. SALTY LITTLE DOG showed some early speed and was outrun. NOT YOUR BIZINESS chased the early pace inside and faded. LANA'S PRETTY
GIRL offered little.

GABBY was quickest, set all the pace, remained unchallenged and held safely under steady urging. BONANZA CREEK chased inside, was gaining late but
was never a threat to the winner. GRANDMA JO shifted out to the four path leaving the backstretch and rallied late to earn show. GOLDSHAFT chased five
wide early, raced five wide into the lane, rallied inside through the stretch and was denied placing late. IT'S NO HOLIDAY lacked early speed and showed a
mild interest late. HUNTERS PRIDE chased four to five wide entering the opening turn and had no response when called upon. TARTANS QUEST flashed
early speed while three wide and outrun. WILA MIST hesitated then broke awkwardly and was unable to recover the ground required. *STEWARDS
INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving WILA MIST, after review it was determined that WILA MIST hesitated and
was deemed to have had a fair start. The Stewards made no change.
