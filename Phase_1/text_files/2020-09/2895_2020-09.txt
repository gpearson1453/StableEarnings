Footnotes
BUCKLEY BAY was away in good order to chase the pace of CAPITAL EXPENSE while racing three-wide, moved up to take command with a sixteenth to
run and held off the closing LEGITMATE CAUSE by a diminishing margin. LEGITIMATE CAUSE was bumped at the break, raced just off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the turn and was gaining late. CAPITAL EXPENSE sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace,
widened through the turn and gave way through the final sixteenth. DOCKTARRI was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the
turn and was not a factor. MOST DETERMINED showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
ARMY KING set a pressured pace while saving ground, relinquished the pacesetting duties to GOBOLDLY after going five furlongs, angled out into the
stretch and wore that foe down in the closing yards. GOBOLDLY was bumped at the start, pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, moved
up to take command nearing the three-eighths marker, opened a clear margin into the stretch but could not resist the winner from over the top. MENSCH
was bumped at the break, raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. SHERM was bumped at
the start, settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and finished evenly late. HE'S BANDIDO was forwardly placed early, moved
three-wide through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. AMANDA'S BEACH BOY raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground through the
second turn and failed to rally. MOKI DUGWAY was bumped at the break, showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not
threaten.

Footnotes
DYF raced unhurried early, advanced four-wide through the turn and was up in the closing yards. SEATTLE SMOKE broke sharply to set a pressured pace
from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly to just miss. GENERAL MACH FOUR pressed the pace of
SEATTLE SMOKE while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead approaching the stretch and
gave way grudgingly late. SLEET AFLEET was forwardly placed from the inside throughout and failed to gain in the drive. GALLANT HEAT pressed the
pace from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way. CATS GULCH lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out
nearing the three-sixteenths pole, and was not a factor. ROB'S GOT GAME refused to break.

ROCKET POWER stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the closing yards. JIMJIMMYJAMES
was reserved just off the leaders from off the rail, angled in into the stretch, rallied in tandem with the winner and just missed. PAMPER ME NOW broke
sharply to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin into the stretch and gave way late. WINNING BLUFF was off a step slow, raced unhurried early,
moved from off the rail through the turn and finished with a steady bid. I WORK FOR CARROTS was away in good order to press the pace while racing
three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. IRISH SWING settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.
MIKE OPERATOR lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and was not a factor.

GOLD SUPPLY stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, angled out further approaching the stretch, reached DOUBLESHOTOFHEAVEN with a
sixteenth to run and was going away late. DOUBLESHOTOFHEAVEN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide to offer a bid nearing the
quarter, led into the stretch and yielded to the winner through the final sixteenth. SASSY EDIE lagged early, raced six-wide through the turn, angled out
further into the stretch and finished with good late energy. COLOUR OF MONEY settled off the leaders from the inside, raced in tight quarters nearing the
quarter and finished evenly late. DAZZLING DEBBI was off a step slow then raced unhurried early, angled out into the stretch and failed to menace. SALTY
LITTLE LASS lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. GUIDED BY ANGELS was bumped at the start, dueled for the lead
from the inside and weakened after going a half. SMARTY JEANS was bumped at the break, disputed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after
a half.

nearing the sixteenth pole and quickly drew off. PADDY'S SECRET raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further in
mid-stretch and was up for the place. KILLARNEY LASS sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, drifted out approaching
the stretch and gave way to the winner through the final sixteenth. REGINELLA raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leader from the inside
and finished evenly in the drive. AMAZONIAN lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not reach contention. DONTKISSNTELL
was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened. DIAMONDS R raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide

Footnotes
ANOTHERTWISTAFATE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a quarter to run and drew
off with complete authority. FIVE STAR GENERAL was never far back, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch, could
not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. THE PRESS was allowed to settle early, saved ground through the second
turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with some late run. ELLIOTT BAY was off a step slow, checked nearing the
thirteen-sixteenths marker, advanced five-wide through the second turn and showed good late interest. PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY sprinted clear at once, raced
off the rail while setting the pace and gave way after going three-quarters. MAKAH LANE was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, saved ground through
the second turn, and did not threaten. LA WAUN chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going five furlongs. HOLLYWOOD HEAT
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened. TAKE CHARGE DEPUTY was bumped at the break, raced off the
pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened. THE RIDER OF ELLIOTT BAY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
PRESS CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF HIS MOUNT AT THE THIRTEEN-SIXTEENTH POLE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE
STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
EMILY'S GOLD settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew off. IRON ROB was away
in good order to duel for the lead from the inside, angled out into the stretch and finished willingly. CODY'S CHOICE hopped at the start, disputed the pace
while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and gave way through the final sixteenth. BATTLE POINT RED was forwardly placed
early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. LOLLY EXPRESS settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through
the turn and finished evenly. OMACHE KID lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and failed to
menace. DEMERARA was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a factor. GENTLE PRINCE showed no early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. HARNERSBACH showed brief speed, raced three-wide through the turn and weakened.

D O'S REIGNOFFIRE settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and held off the closing
NORSKI to prevail. NORSKI lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, was bumped in mid-stretch, moved between foes nearing the sixteenth
pole, rallied and just missed. TUMAC MOUNTAIN showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, drifted out in mid-stretch and finished willingly
when straightened away. FUZZY DOLPHIN broke sharply to dispute the pace from the inside, opened a clear margin into the stretch and gave way through
the final sixteenth. AERO STREET settled off the leaders early, raced from off the rail through the turn, angled out into the stretch, was bumped with a
furlong to run, lacked room late and failed to threaten. R B EYE broke awkwardly and was bumped, showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the
turn, angled in nearing the eighth pole and did not menace. FREESTONE chased the leaders while racing four-wide for a half and weakened. ALL ABOUT

Footnotes
MISS CALCULATION stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to engage nearing the three-eighths marker, responded when challenged by
LIRIO TIGRADO nearing the quarter, vied through a vigorous drive and gamely prevailed. LIRIO TIGRADO lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the
turn, offered a bid nearing the quarter, vied with the winner through a prolonged drive and just missed. CHANTE was away alertly to race just off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the turn, offered a bid nearing the quarter but could not match strides with the top pair in the drive. MERRY MARIE was
bumped at the break, pressed the pace from the inside for a half and gave way. FULLY COMPLIANT lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and
failed to menace. BEAZEE BOLT was bumped at the break, raced off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. HELEN FIRE broke sharply to
set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, weakened after going a half and was eased.
