RELENTLESS LION pressed the pace while racing two wide, gained command nearing the far turn, built a clear lead through the stretch under steady
handling and was in hand late. LITTLE LEO stalked the pace from the outside, raced three wide down the backstretch, moved up four wide at the eighth
pole and was no match for the winner. SIR DOUGLAS settled off the early pace, raced along the inside throughout and had no final winning bid. LUNAR
ROVER dropped back early, raced three deep in the lane and never was a factor. BEST OFFER showed good speed while racing two wide and gave way.

BEACHTREASUREGIRL was allowed to settle early, moved up along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and finished well to get up under
strong handling. MOON OVER VICTORIA set all the pace, raced just off the inside through the drive and couldn't hold off the winner late to finish second
best. REVOLVING LOVE pressed the pace while racing between rivals and weakened in the latter stages. THAT IS KEY stalked the pace, raced four deep
in the stretch and weakened. GONEASAGIRLCANGET was slow early and never threatened.
