Footnotes
IRANISTAN secured the pocket after the field had been released from the flag, was well rated tracking BODES WELL within striking distance, tipped into the
two path after stepping onto the fourth bend, remained under a confident ride proceeding along the backstretch for the final time, crept up to the one to
catch after the final hurdle, drew abreast of the leader at the five-sixteenths pole, with the pilot having resorted to a brisk hand ride by this juncture,
challenged in earnest heading hone, emerged a furlong from the finish line in charge, lengthened away smartly. NEW MEMBER (IRE) unhurried travelling
towards the two path in the early going, began to move up after leaving the penultimate turn, got cued up for the drive, angled three wide at the head of the
stretch, rallied for the place, although no match for the top one. GO GET THE BASIL sat in range two wide, swung out slightly wider for the stretch run,
mustered up a mild response to secure the show. CRACKER FACTORY (GB) underwent a ground-saving journey, lacked a strong kick. BODES WELL
(IRE) established the top prior to arriving at the first jump, showed the way, rating kindly on a loosely-contested lead, felt the presence of the eventual
winner after settling onto the last of five turns, got put to the test by IRANISTAN spinning into the stretch, succumbed and backed away. MACCABEE strung
out five wide on all five turns, gave way. NOAH AND THE ARK (IRE) away awkwardly, brought up the back of the pack, alternated between the inside route
and path two taking up the chase, appeared to graze hurdles two and six, got driven four wide for the commencement of the stretch run, failed to fire.
SHOW COURT (IRE) two wide in pursuit of BODES WELL, was gathered then maneuvered three wide stepping onto the backstretch the second time,
appeared through by the turn five, went into the lane and was allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
CELTIC CHAOS coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside from near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, tipped out to the four or five path near the eighth pole, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command inside the
sixteenth marker and brushed in the final jumps with THE CARETAKER when drifting in slightly to the wire. THE CARETAKER broke in at the start bumping
JOE'S SMOKIN GUN then got bumped by FORT WORTH who also broke inwards and was bumped between foes conceding about three lengths to the
front, chased three to four wide from near the rear, advanced through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper
stretch, rallied to collar the leader near the sixteenth marker while under threat of his own, got displaced inside that station while battling on, then was
brushed late by the aforementioned foe while clear for the place honors. FORT WORTH broke in at the start bumping THE CARETAKER into JOE'S
SMOKIN GUN, ranged up inside to prompt the leader while in hand, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over command narrowly and cut the
corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. MANIFEST DESTINY three wide in
pursuit in range of the front, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. HIGH
COMMAND bobbled at the break, recovered to establish the front and show the way in hand just off the inside under some prompting from FORT WORTH
to the inside but not overly pressured, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole as that pressure intensified, yielded the front and spun two to three wide
into upper stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. JOE'S SMOKIN GUN got bumped at the start by THE CARETAKER breaking inwards and then
bumped again by THE CARETAKER but this time due to pressure from FORT WORTH breaking inwards and conceded about three lengths to the front,
chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired.

nicely in fourth position, moved out leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the final turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, rallied outside into the stretch,

while rank into the first turn, traveled around that bend in the two path, settled at the back, was urged along while two then three wide on the far turn then

fighting the rider and moved out, accelerated forward while tugging hard at the bit to move clear on the initial straightaway, showed the way in the two path,

Footnotes
ROAD TO MEATH away without apparent mishap, got involved between rivals for the top during the initial stages, was allowed to drop back a bit as the first
fraction was being finalized, shifted into the three path and moved up to re-engage LARCENY for command, tucked back into the two path after scooting by
the now-fading LIAM'S FIRE early on the turn, was under confident handling seizing control in the general area of the quarter pole, ventured onward for
another sixteenth before having the rider resort to a hand drive, got flashed the whip from the right side on occasion but was otherwise kept to that hand ride
scampering away from the others. KABOB got set up in the pocket coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, was put to a drive spinning two wide into
the lane, ground his way into second place. LARCENY argued for the advantage from along the inside route, had already been asked for more late on the
bend after being replaced on the lead by the winner, blew second in the shadow of the wire. RIGHTDOWNGENTLEMEN pursued the pace two to three
wide on the turn, swung out four wide for the drive, lacked the necessary response. REVENIO dove over to the rail after stumbling at the start, never made
his presence felt. KING OF AMERICAN chased the pace two wide, was never in it. DULL KNIFE tracked the pace from along the inside route, got ridden
two wide entering the stretch, gave out. DUBLIN GREEN two wide onto the turn, was sent out four wide exiting it, had no rally. LIAM'S FIRE three then two
wide, disputed the pace until the half mile pole, faded.

Footnotes
PER CAPITA just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn in closest aim of the leader coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command near the
sixteenth pole, dug in under threat drifting out a bit late while holding safe to prevail. HUNT THE FRONT struck the near side stall at the start and was away
last, grew detached unhurried at the tail of the field while saving ground through the first turn, took to the two path down the backstretch, briefly tucked inside
half a mile from home, before tipping out three wide at the three-eighths getting placed to coaxing just inside that station, went seven wide into upper
stretch, offered up a good finish, drifted in near the finish pausing very briefly as PER CAPITA drifted out in front and was up for the place honors.
HEIRLOOM KITTEN coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside through sensible splits safely in front and under little pressure, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths with rivals busy in behind, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and capitulated at the sixteenth
marker, then fought on inside a pair to the finish to be along clear for the show honors. YANKEE DIVISION five wide into the first turn, raced four then three
wide through that bend before giving chase three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the far turn and got put to coaxing at
the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. CANDY TYCOON coaxed from the gate, raced four then three wide
through the first turn, chased three to four wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and
weakened. WALKOFF coaxed from the start, raced three then two wide through the opening bend, chased just off the inside from just off the pace, tucked
inside half a mile from home and came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. GRIT AND GLORY
stumbled forwardly at the start, chased along the inside until tipped to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

CLENCH brushed with a foe at the start then was hustled, chased the pace down the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch,
pursued the leading duo under a strong hand ride, was put to a right-handed whip at the furlong marker then made a bid shortly thereafter, battled well
outside two foes to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. ARISTOCRATIC moved in while showing speed, set the pace under some
pressure, vied in the two path on the turn, was roused inside the five-sixteenths, came under a left-handed whip while on even terms for the lead in upper
stretch, switched to a right-handed whip outside the eighth-pole, fought gamely in the final furlong but was denied at the wire while just able to get the place.
WEGOTOLDYOUGOTSOLD chased the pace on the outside, made a bid at the half-mile pole, vied in the three path on the turn, drew even with the leader
under a right-handed whip in upper stretch, fought on well in the final furlong but just missed while able to get the show. LIFE IN SHAMBLES broke out then
brushed with a foe, was urged along on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, angled out under a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly for
the last spot in the superfecta. SHAMROCKED chased the pace while just behind the leader, raced inside on the turn, turned into the stretch under the
whip, drifted out inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. TOPPER T broke out at the start, settled off the pace, took an awkward stride near
the half-mile pole, was urged along in the two path on the turn and failed to rally. FLOWERS FOR LISA settled towards the rear under some urging, dropped
back with a half-mile to run, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HAWAIIAN NOISES broke very awkwardly
then tossed his head, was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and was no factor.

LOVESTRUCK steadied as NO ORDINARY TIME was wandering onto her path in the shadow of the starting gate, was set up along the inside route in rapid
order, pulled hard on the bit tracking the front runners during the early going of the run around the clubhouse bend, continued to pursue the pacesetter,
fourth in line while saving ground, flashed interest approaching the quarter pole, maintained it angling three wide into the lane, clawed its way into
contention, in addition to coming up closer and closer to FREEDOMOFTHEPRESS occupying the same path , was aggressively maneuvered farther to the
outside deep into the furlong grounds, on a mission to attain path four and better racing room, made hard contact with MRS FRANKEL, herself coming in
with the rider applying some stick work from the right side, muscled her way into the coveted path at the expense of the aforementioned rival, closed in with
good energy, secured the advantage then edged away in the last few jumps. FREEDOMOFTHEPRESS cut over towards the inside, was spaced at a slight
distance from off the rail keeping watch on the front runners, saw the rider resort to some hand urging by the five-sixteenths pole, swung out three wide into
the lane and took off in earnest after the ones to catch, forged to an abbreviated lead in deep stretch before having it snatched away by LOVESTRUCK, had
no trouble salvaging second. ARMY WIFE prompted the pace from path two, issued a stiff challenge heading onto the top of the lane, gained a narrow lead,
got caught soon shortly afterwards, weakened into the show slot. NO ORDINARY TIME out with her initial step, crossed onto the top one's path, leading that
foe's rider to steady the mount, assumed a straighter course and the advantage, led the way, racing rankly for much of the trip on the first turn, went into the
backstretch appearing much more professional, carved out the pace, with ARMY WIFE in accompaniment in path two, got put to the test by that opponent
as they turned into the lane, relinquished deep into the furlong grounds, steadily backed away. MRS FRANKEL (IRE) made it into the pocket nearing the
end of the homestretch, eyed the front runners within striking distance, went approximately four wide into the lane, began to shift into a tighter fit along its
path when fed some right side pressure in the furlong grounds just as the top one was herself getting steered towards her, lost any remaining interest after
bumping soundly with that opponent in the vicinity of the eighth pole. TISTAAHAL sat reserved along the inside route, fanned out into path five from upper to
midlane, made no headway. MY LITTLE MINX off to a sluggish beginning, underwent a two wide pursuit, came three to four wide into the stretch, made no
impact. JULIE BIRD (IRE) chased the pace from path two in midpack, moved out about four wide for the drive, gave way. BERTRADA two wide early, got
guided over to the inside prior to the second bend, went on to save ground to no avail. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the stretch run, in addition
to a claim of foul lodged by the rider of MRS FRANKEL against the rider of LOVESTRUCK alleging interference, the result was allowed to stand and the
race was declared official.

Footnotes
BALLAGH ROCKS broke out a step at the start bumping BREAKING THE RULES and was briefly leaned on by that rival, settled forwardly placed just off
the inside tracking the leader in closest aim to the outside, remained patiently handled down the backstretch and into the far turn, steadily advanced to latch
on the leader near the five-sixteenths, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command
three-sixteenths from the finish and edged clear under a drive before finishing under a vigorous hand ride through the final sixteenth to prevail. LARGENT
established the front and showed the way rated along the inside, remained patiently handled through sensible splits, came under pressure for the initial time
midway on the far turn, got put to coaxing just outside the quarter pole before being set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat
and was collared at the three-sixteenths, then ran on safe for the place honors. DEVAMANI (FR) just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under
coaxing nearing the quarter pole, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors over the remaining pair. BREAKING
THE RULES bumped at the start by BALLAGH ROCKS who broke out a step, tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket, got set down spinning just
off the inside into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish and was outfinished for the show honors. OLYMPICO (FR) just off the inside through the
first turn, tracked three then two wide down the backstretch briefly using the cover of BALLAGH ROCKS before tipping back three wide through the far turn
into the clear, came under coaxing near the quarter pole before being let out swinging three to four wide at the top of the stretch, dug in under a drive
running on evenly through to the finish and was outkicked.

Footnotes
TEAM MERCHANTS was fractious in the gate then backed out and reloaded, broke out at the start but was quickly corrected, pressed the pace on the
outside, vied two then three wide on the turn, took the advantage at the quarter-pole, drifted in while kicking clear in upper stretch, swapped to the proper
lead when put to a left-handed whip outside the furlong marker and proved much the best under steady urging. TEN FOR TEN broke a step slow, was
ridden along off the pace, moved out some leaving the backstretch, went four wide early on the turn then dropped to the three path, turned into the stretch
under the whip and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. SPEAKER'S CORNER broke a bit slow, was urged along towards the rear,
raced inside to the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and improved position to just get the show. SAVOY was urged along on the
outside, moved in leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch then drifted in around the three-sixteenths and
also improved position while along the rail but just missed the show. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN was away alertly, showed the way under some pressure to
his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage at the quarter-pole, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way. HAPPY RAGE settled off the
pace, was urged along while moving from three to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch under the whip and came up empty. OUTLIER
bobbled just after the start then was hustled, chased the pace down the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, floated five wide into the stretch
under a left-handed whip and tired. DEMON was urged along towards the front, dropped back while inside on the turn and retreated. FOUR WHEELER was
slow into stride, fell well behind the rest of the field, rounded the turn in the two path and trailed.

CUCINA away in good order, made contact with TIKHVIN FLEW a few strides later, dove over to the rail and took it until the conclusion of the backstretch,
abandoned the premises for the two path at the top of the turn, stalked the runaway leader from afar, got switched over to stronger handling a short distance
from the end of the bend, angled three wide into the lane, straightened away and closed in readily, went by THE BIG S inside the eighth pole, kicked clear
before being geared down in the final seventy yards. THE BIG S took up position in the two path on the backstretch, improved late on the bend, settled onto
the top of the lane and was given its cue, wrested away the advantage in the furlong grounds, only to have the eventual winner take aim shortly afterwards,
was reeled in leaving the furlong marker, held well for the place. DUDLEY SQUARE along the outside, stepped onto the turn from path two, got moved out
four wide for the drive home, mustered up a mild response to garner the show award. TIKHVIN FLEW broke to the outside but was corrected before making
any significant contact with MAXIMILIANO, went onward for a few more jumps, before steadying while in the process of being squeezed back, got guided
over to the rail by the half mile pole, was put to encouragement by the five-sixteenths pole, went two to three wide into the lane, had some gain.
MAXIMILIANO bumped shortly after the field had been sent off and running, was three wide entering the turn, got sent out five wide exiting it, had no punch.
IMA PHAROAH remained stationed along the inside route after lunging at the start, cut the corner into the lane, failed to fire. INK SPLOTZ broke on top and
retained the advantage, cut over to the inside, opened up on the others, yielded in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole and backed away. CHASE
TRACKER pursued the pace three wide on the turn, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, never got involved.

set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to stack outside a trio a furlong from home, seized command near the sixteenth marker and inched
away to the finish kept to task. MR. KRINGLE coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside, got let out taking the inside route into upper stretch
in behind the leader, lacked optimal clearance straightened away but had HARDREDCANDY drift slightly in front and rallied up the inside to take command
just outside the eighth pole the innermost of a quartet hitting that station together, dug in and was collared at the sixteenth pole, ran on willingly to secure the
place honors. MYSTERY BANK broke out at the start bumping QUARTERBACK DAK just after the break, tracked the pace along the inside in range of the
front, tipped to the two path through the far turn and came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled five wide into upper stretch, ran on through to
the finish improving his position to secure the show honors at the finish. BAIL OUT saved ground near the rear of the field through to the seven-sixteenths
when tipped two to three wide, came under a ride nearing the quarter pole, went seven wide at the head of the stretch and kept on outside for the last major
share. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY four then three wide into the first turn, tracked the leader from the two path in close aim, came under coaxing loosely between
foes at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. HARDREDCANDY three wide into the first turn,
showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a trio and was
collared just outside the eighth pole, then weakened in the final furlong. FREEDOM AND WHISKY two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. WILD BANKER got bumped at the start by
QUARTERBACK DAK due to pressure from MYSTERY BANK, got hard held early on and was dragged back to settle saving ground at the tail of the field,

DAK bumped at the start by MYSTERY BANK who broke outwards and in turn bumped WILD BANKER, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under
a ride five-sixteenths from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and had no rally. ELUSIVE RULER three wide through the first turn, chased

PROVEN STRATEGIES broke very alertly and went straight to the front then moved clear early, was well rated while setting the pace in the two path,
responded well when asked in the three path into the stretch, remained clear into the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead outside the
sixteenth-pole and held under a strong hand ride. GAUGUIN (GER) went around the first turn in the two path, was unhurried towards the rear, rounded the
far turn in the two to three path, was roused at the quarter-pole then dropped to the hedge in upper stretch and finished with good energy to just get the
place. BASQUIAT broke in and bumped with a rival, was placed under a tight hold early, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came
under urging in the three path on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, drifted in under a right-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths then was
switched to a right-handed whip, gained on the outside, swapped back to a right-handed whip at the sixteenth-pole and also finished with good energy but

Footnotes
JACKIE'S WARRIOR put to a light hand ride springing from the starting gate, wasted no time establishing the top, cut the fractions on a loosely-contested
lead, spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, pulling on the left, was allowed to spin three to four wide onto the head of the stretch, was a little beyond
the three-sixteenths pole when finally called upon for more, offered up the desired response, was in complete command when wrapped up for the final
seventy yards. REINVESTMENT RISK stalked the winner two to three wide, got asked to pick it after the half had been rattled off, was hand driven towards
the four path for entrance into the stretch, proved no match. MUTASAABEQ took up the chase from path two on the turn, got roused crossing the midway
point of the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wide, secured the show. AMPERSAND gathered after breaking to the outside, raced three wide into the
lane, stepped about as wide into the stretch, had no rally. PAPETU tracked JACKIE'S WARRIOR from along the inside route, was taken hold of running out
of run late on the bend, went into the lane, was allowed to fade away having been placed to a protective hold. NUTSIE sighted two wide at the top of the
turn, never made his presence felt. FEARLESS FLY rode the rail, spun into the stretch appearing to have little left, was then protected while being allowed
to back away readily.

Footnotes
SIR CHUBBY tracked the pace along the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was roused spinning just off the inside
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive behind the top pair, had the seam between them part and split those rivals just inside the eighth pole to then take
command a sixteenth out, then inched away to the finish to prevail. VICARAGE two to three wide near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on with late foot to procure the place honors nearing the finish. BOLD GEM established the front and showed
the way in hand along the inside, had STARE DECISIS range up outside into the backstretch and was briefly headed before taking back command
quickening the pace slightly, shook away a bit into the far turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under
threat and was collared near the sixteenth marker, then ran on to preserve the show honors. MOHJESTIC two to three wide in range, bid three wide through
the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and drifted near the eighth pole, weakened
in the late stages. SEIZE THE HAY three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened
in the late going. INAPPROPRIATE two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. STARE DECISIS broke out at the start and brushed with a rival, grew rank
under restraint just off the inside through the first turn and was released by the rider and given some rein advancing quickly into the backstretch to sidle up
to the leader to the outside, remained forwardly placed and came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide for home running out of energy
and backed away to the finish while flashed an off sided stick. TRI SAINT LORENZO chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun
just off the inside for home and tired. KICKIN' KIRBY three wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
spun three wide into upper stretch and tired.
