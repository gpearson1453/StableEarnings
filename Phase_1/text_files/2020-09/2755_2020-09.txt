Footnotes
COLOSSAL STORM broke sharp from the inside, quickly gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, continued to show the way through
the second turn, widen the margin at the eighth pole and was well clear while in hand always. ZYZACK stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily
advanced up the backstretch, responded entering the drive but was no match while clearly second best. TROPHY DADDY pressed the early pace from the
inside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded but could not keep pace. GEMINATOR well placed from the outside, remained forward for the
drive but had nothing left. BACK ROAD OUTLAW could only improve position. UNBRIDLED PULPIT could only pass tiring rivals. IRISH MISSILE was no
real factor. ZENMAN was no threat. LAST PAYCHECK forced the early pace outside and faded. GOING JAPANESE was never a threat. MAYAN GHOST
chased the early pace inside and faded. WENDY'S WILL had a steady fade.
