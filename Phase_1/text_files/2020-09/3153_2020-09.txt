JUST ASK JOEL stalked the pace along the inside, moved up three wide nearing the eighth pole and finished well to just get up under strong
encouragment. DREAMMASTER was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and finished gamely to just miss. OLD SOT was
bumped at the break, raced just off the inside into the upper stretch, angled five wide through the lane and finished willingly to the wire. CARRIES MAN
stalked the early pace, moved up two wide through the lane to challenge and weakened a bit in the latter stages. MOUNTAIN BREEZE was allowed to settle
in the early stages, moved up nearing the far turn, came in a bit at the quarter pole, forced rival to take up, raced five wide through the drive had not enough.
Mountain Breeze was disqualified and placed ninth for causing interference at the quarter pole. CINTAROSA RANCH set all the pace and weakened along
the inside through the drive. MAYFAIR HEIGHTS was bumped at the break, raced three wide past the eighth pole and had no late rally. SEDONA SUNSET
settled off the early going, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. EVIE'S PRINCE stalked the early pace, was forced to take up
sharply at the quarter pole and was moved up to eighth through the objection. CLEAR ADVANTAGE raced five wide around the first turn, swung out seven
wide into the upper stretch and never threatened after experiencing a wide trip. LASTSONGANDDANCE failed to sustain a bid. FANDO dropped back early
and failed to have a response.

STEPHEN'S ANSWER set all the pace and held gamely to prevail under all out pressure. MR. TICKLE was unhurried early, moved up four wide into the
upper stretch and slowly closing in on the winner late. TARUCA stalked the pace, raced two wide around the far turn through the stretch and lacked a late
response. BLUE HARBOR was off very slow, raced along the inside through the lane and had not enough. WRATH raced in tight quarters early, saved
ground throughout and had no kick in the drive. WESTBOUND pressed the pace and tired readily.

Footnotes
SOMETHING SUPER pressed the early pace, raced two wide while racing between horses and finished gamely to prevail under all out pressure. TAPALIST
settled off the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch, lacked room nearing the eighth pole, shifted two wide and closed in
gamely late. BELEWS GOLD stalked the early pace, raced four wide at the quarter pole and finished willingly to the wire. CENTSMYBABYLEFTME pressed
the pace from the inside and weakened a bit in the latter stages. ROGALLO was allowed to settle off the early going, angled five wide through the stretch
and closed too late. BEGGAR showed good early speed and weakened in the latter stages. FREE DREAM flipped when the gate opened and unseated his
rider.
