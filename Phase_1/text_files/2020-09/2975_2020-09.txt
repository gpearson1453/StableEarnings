BOOMTOWN away alertly set the pace widening in upper stretch being ridden out along the inside. EYE HAVE CANDY tracked the pace through the turn
emerging a threat in the three path upper stretch going willingly the final eighth securing place. MY CLAW hustled along raced four wide to upper stretch
giving an even finish. FURY SONG pressed then chased through the turn weakening on the inside in upper stretch. PINKIE PINK off slowly played no
factor. EZZADORA varied little throughout. SOVEREIGN CAT was always outrun. DAMA DE NOCHE offered little.

GOLDEN TREASURY stalked the pace rallying clear on the far turn drawing out in upper stretch angling out while being kept to the task late. ESTRELA
CADENTE went evenly giving chase on the far turn vying from mid track in upper stretch angling inside late. TANDA'S JOY gave a prompted middle move
chasing through the far turn extending in the three path upper stretch coming up short. BLUEBERRY SHINE slow early was never in contention racing
evenly from mid track down the lane to best the others. ALLIE GRACE slow early played no factor. VESTED VENTURE hustled an early lead coming up
empty on the far turn. FASHION ENVY outrun early would tire.

DREAM SATURDAY made the early lead setting the pace in the four path to the far turn, widened into upper stretch digging in from the two path holding
clear. UNINVITED stalked the pace chasing four wide to upper stretch vying willingly the final eighth. VOW'S SON stalked the pace on the inside through
the far turn angling from the two to the three path late giving all at the end. TERMINAL SPEED raced mid pack angling five wide to upper stretch chasing to
the wire. ANGEL'S KNIGHT raced evenly through the far turn circling six wide in upper stretch having some late interest. LAST CONFESSION prompted the
pace through the backside, began to waver on the far turn fading along the inside down the stretch. BAY AREA was never involved. BURKIE was always
outrun.
