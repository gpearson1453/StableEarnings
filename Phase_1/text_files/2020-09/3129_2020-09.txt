leaving the turn but took over past the eighth pole and held on well. ON THIS DAY chased the pace and rounded the turn near the rail, dueled for second
inside the sixteenth pole and finished well. SCHLOSSER chased the pace outside, rounded the turn about the six path and finished well to take third the
final yards. BEARCAT KITTEN gave chase in the three path and finished evenly. PHONEMYPOSSEAGAIN tapered to the inside to set the pace and came
under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn near the rail but drifted into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
CORY'S CUTIE raced off the pace about the three path then bid past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn five wide, took the lead mid-stretch and
widened the final sixteenth. CASTLEINTHEMEADOW settled just off the pace and off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole then
dueled through the final sixteenth for second. ABSORB rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole and contested the
advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, but was caught mid-stretch and flattened in the duel for second. WILKO LOVESONG settled off the earlier pace
about the three path then bid from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. EARNED THE SHOT
settled off the pace in the three path, bid approaching the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn four wide, then weakened into the lane. IM A TRICKY
ONE saved ground off the early pace then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn
then flattened stride the final sixteenth. EYES ON FIRE saved ground off the pace then picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, faded
nearing the far turn and was not encouraged the final quarter mile.

rounding the turn, then dueled through the final sixteenth for second. MIGHTY CROSSING pressured the pace inside but dropped back past the five
sixteenths pole and was outfinished for second the final sixteenth. WILD CORK gave chase and rounded the turn about the three path then flattened stride
inside the sixteenth pole. DIANATHEHUNTRESS chased the pace through the backstretch then flattened stride about the four path of the turn.

Footnotes
JUBA TRAIN took the lead past the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, widened through the turn and was steadily handled down the lane. SPLIT THE
CHECK pressured the pace through the backstretch but dropped back on the turn and just lasted for place. STROLLING THROUGH gave chase and raced
at the rail on the turn then dug in through the lane and just missed second. TEST ME I DARE U chased the leaders through the backstretch, rounded the
turn in the seven path and finished evenly. JAMESTOWN ROAD steadied leaving the chute then picked up the chase inside, steadied again near the rail off
the heels of Strolling Through, was eased off the rail into the turn then flattened stride the final furlong. C V'S POWERPAK steadied on the chute and raced
well back from early contention, angled to the eight path on the turn and passed some. SKINNY MOLLY gave chase and rounded the turn about the five
path then showed little more. MY PRETTY EYES chased the pace through the backstretch, raced in the four path of the turn then weakened. CREATIVE
SPLENDOR saved ground on the turn. MOONLIT SHADOW was sluggish getting into stride and raced well back then saved ground on the turn.

Footnotes
CAYENNE CREEK stalked the pace from the two and three paths then challenged toward the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms from that point,
took the nod approaching the five sixteenths, kept the advantage off the rail through the far turn then drew off and was in hand late. BOLD VALOR took the
lead and angled to the inside nearing the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure when met by the winner at the three eighths pole and
stayed with that one to the five sixteenths, but dropped back, raced at the rail on the far turn and settled for second best. ASTRO RIDER settled off the pace
in the three and four paths the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little more. SILVER
TAURUS was bumped inward and into Village Prince leaving the gate and rounded the first turn about the four path, raced outside into the backstretch, bid
nearing the three eighths pole and could only improve his position in the four path of the far turn. PAPA RALPH J was bumped at the break and saved
ground the first turn, eased out into the backstretch then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and showed little more.
CREATIVE MINESHAFT broke in to make contact with Silver Taurus then stalked the early pace while saving ground the first turn, picked up the chase from
the seven sixteenths pole but faded off the rail leaving the far turn. VILLAGE PRINCE was pinched and bumped inward into Papa Ralph J leaving the gate
then raced well back saving ground. A IS FOR ARTIST was through early. COCONUT MAN rounded the first turn in the five path and raced outside into the
backstretch then faded toward the five sixteenths pole.

REFORM SCHOOL accelerated to the lead nearing the three eighths pole and rated a short lead, rounded the turn near the rail and was steadily handled,
with mostly a vigorous hand ride, to widen. HYPOTHESIS pressured the early pace then gave chase from the three eighths pole and dueled through the
final sixteenth for second. FIBER AND EMILY chased the pace off the rail then eased to the four path on the turn and was outfinished for second the final
sixteenth. EUTAW STREET gave chase and rounded the turn off the rail then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. BEST SHOT was hustled along with
the early lead then gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced close through the turn but dropped back toward the head of the lane and flattened stride.
BRIAN'S AVENUE saved ground. UNRIDEABULL raced well back. GOLD AND STRIKE gave chase and rounded the turn about the five path then
weakened.

Footnotes
ECLIPTICALS VISKI took quick control to rate the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, contested the advantage near the rail on
the far turn and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. DYNACASTLE rated close off the rail then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
dueled at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn but dropped back into the stretch and had to settle for second. WALKNTHEPLANK settled off the
pace two deep the opening turn then started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path but drifted toward the head
of the lane and was along for third later yards. LIL WATTY saved ground the first turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far
turn and was outfinished for third later yards. LIZZIE'S LAST settled off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole but bore out
midway on the far turn and showed little more. CALCUTTA broke inward across the path of the slow breaking Sterlings Morena and settled off the pace in
the three and four paths, then showed little response past the seven sixteenths pole. LINEA VERDE stumbled leaving the gate then saved ground, picked
up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole but faded at the rail into the far turn. STERLINGS MORENA broke a step slow and was pinched back at the
start, then raced well back in the four path the first turn. SINGINGINSTILETTOS broke outward across the path of the late breaking Sterlings Morena, raced
well off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn and never factored. Congress Hall, originally slated to run in this race, became unruly and flipped
behind the starting gate and was consequently scratched by the Stewards.
