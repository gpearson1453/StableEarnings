Footnotes
RAILMASTER stayed along the rail, moved to the front approaching the seven-sixteenths pole, drew out early on the turn and was well in hand through the
lane. BOAT'S A ROCKIN wasn't far back outside and couldn't gain. RAPID BEAT broke in the air, moved to make the early pace, raced two wide outside
the winner into the turn then weakened. OWIN broke slowly, trailed into the stretch then made a belated run outside. ZIPPY JO was bumped leaving the
gate, was taken well in hand early while between foes, raced two wide into the turn and stopped. MR STARK ducked out into ZIPPY JO leaving the gate,
wasn't far back along the rail into the turn then stopped. MANATEE was outrun.

SUPER VISION settled, rallied the two path around the final turn, vied outside the early leader in early stretch, the rider dropped his whip leaving the furlong
grounds and was up after a long hard drive. VOUCH was hustled to a clear lead soon after the break, was rated along the rail into the stretch, responded
when challenged but lost on the nod. GEMS MINESHAFT RVF lagged early then outfinished tired ones. MAIN COOL CAT bore out on the final turn, raced
wide into the stretch and flattened out. WONDERFULLY TUNED was no factor. SWINGING STAR stopped.

steadied and altered course repeatedly through the lane to avoid the loose horse. DARK HEART wasn't far back early, raced the three path around the turn
and proved second best while no threat. TONIGHT MAYBE was close up two wide into the turn then tired. AMAZING ANNA steadied while pressed outside
the winner nearing the half-mile pole, angled to the rail on the turn and stopped. JUSTKISSMYGRITS broke slowly then was wide and outrun. DANCE

CLOUD CHASER broke slowly, moved up between horses, swung out leaving the turn, closed between horses and was up on the nod. THAT'S HISTORY
was carried out while vying outside the early leader on the backstretch, moved to a clear lead in the three path midway on the turn, remained clear into late
stretch but couldn't last. MANAHAWKIN lagged early, raced the three path around the turn and finished willingly outside. EXPEDITER was close up along
the inside into the turn then tired. HAYNESFIELD BEST opened a clear lead soon after the break, began to bear out before a quarter, bolted to the fence
entering the turn and was eased up.

Footnotes
SULLEYS BOO was slow early, rallied the rail around the turn, swung out entering the stretch, took over from between rivals leaving the furlong grounds
and held. LIL SURVIVOR was bumped leaving the gate, settled, rallied three wide around the turn, swung wide into the stretch, tried outside the winner
through the lane but wasn't enough. BRAZILIAN BAY was hard ridden from the gate, bore out early on the backstretch, stayed inside around the turn,
moved closer in early stretch then weakened. TIZ TAS TIME took command at once, drew out to a long lead in the two path on the turn then faded from
between rivals in the drive. JEANNE'S JOY made a run two wide between rivals into the stretch then flattened out. LOVELY O'PRADO ducked out into LIL
SURVIVOR leaving the gate, checked sharply early on the backstretch when BRAZILIAN BAY bore out, couldn't catch up and was eased up. CHIMERA
moved to press outside the early leader on the backstretch, stopped after three furlongs and was eased up through the lane.
