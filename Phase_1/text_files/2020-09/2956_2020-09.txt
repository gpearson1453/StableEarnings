some and under the whip got the job done while between on the line. ICY DUDE Lagged back along the three path, two path into the last turn, four wide out
of it, altered course to the inside a furlong out appearing to be in gear and failed to sustain the bid but finished well. BOZZINI Five wide early, gained four
wide on the last turn, angled out in the lane and finished well. MAGNETRON In hand up the backstretch, three path on the last turn and weakened. A
MAIZE ZING RIP Broke sharply, set the pace off the rail, was collared nearing the top of the lane and gave way. KICHIRO Broke slow, saved ground on the
