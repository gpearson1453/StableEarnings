backstretch, bid between rivals nearing the quarter pole, battled outside of the pacesetter to the sixteenth pole and drove clear late. ANANROAD broke a bit
slowly, moved three wide to the lead around the clubhouse turn, set the pace in the two path down the backstretch and around the far turn, battled on inside
of the winner through much of the stretch was no match in the final sixteenth. SUPER DANCER raced off the pace four wide and was along for the show.
JOLLY WELSHMAN was a bit rank around the first turn, raced in range four wide, bid outside of the winner nearing the lane but came up empty in the
straight. PEACHY KEEN failed to menace while racing two wide. MARKOFTHEMAKER saved ground in midpack, dropped back nearing the far turn,

shares and did win that battle. VAUNT prompted the pace two wide, continued on her left lead through the lane, battled inside of foes for third and was
outfinished. THE BAY EXPRESS stalked the pace three wide between foes and came up empty in the lane. TREASURED INFO was outrun inside.

Footnotes
KEEPYOURSKATESON stalked the pace outside, angled in nearing the five-sixteenths pole and bumped MOSLER'S IMAGE, seized command nearing the
quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. FLIRTATIOUS LASS prompted the pace four wide, bid nearing the quarter pole,
drifted out under left-handed urging in upper stretch, drifted in under right-handed urging in midstretch and finished evenly to maintain the place. MOSLER'S
IMAGE stalked the pace inside, was bumped nearing the five-sixteenths pole, lacked a serious rally but stayed on for the show. SPRITE'S LADY went
evenly inside. SONG OF HONOR failed to menace while racing three wide. LITTLE MISS HODOR was bumped at the start, steadied near the half-mile
pole, raced four wide around the turn and never threatened. VELADERA broke slowly, raced two wide and played no factor. PAMALWAYSGETSEVEN
broke in and bumped LITTLE MISS HODOR at the start, then made little further impact while racing two wide. TAK E LADY set the early pace, bore out
nearing the lane and retreated. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF MOSLER'S IMAGE AND A STEWARDS INQUIRY,
KEEPYOURSKATESON WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED THIRD FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE FIVE-SIXTEENTHS POLE.

HOLLYWOOD TALENT vied two wide to upper stretch and edged clear under a drive. APACHE BRAVE stalked the pace three wide, continued on his left
lead in the lane and finished willingly to gain the place late. CHARLIE MOPS stalked the pace inside, bid in upper stretch but was outfinished. MCCLURE
lacked early speed inside, angled out in upper stretch and rallied. STREET TAIL dueled inside of the winner and weakened in the lane. PHILOSOPHY was
not a threat while racing four wide. FLY E DUBAI lacked early speed, saved ground around most of the turn, swung four wide nearing the quarter pole and
lacked the needed rally. TOO MUCH DATA broke inwardly and slowly and was outrun inside. KING GATTO hesitated at the start and was never involved.

Footnotes
TONKA FLOWER set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. ALDO'S KITTEN chased the winner two wide between foes and finished willingly
once clear in the lane to be clearly second best. FROST'S SONG chase the pace from the rail, lacked a rally and lasted for the show. GADAGO lacked
speed, raced two wide, had a mild rally and just missed third. FOLDS OF HONOR pressed the pace three wide and tired in the lane.
EXTREMELYEXCLUSIVE steadied at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. SINGLE FOCUS was outrun inside.

Footnotes
WICKED STRONG ALEX lacked speed, raced five wide around the turn, closed with a rush while lugging in under left-handed urging and was up and clear
late. BLACKSHEAR set the pace in the two path, drew off around the turn, held clear to deep stretch but was swallowed up late. JUST ENOUGH raced in
range three wide, had dead aim in upper stretch but was one-paced. SMALL INVASION stalked the pace two wide and weakened a bit in the lane. GONE
ANGEL'S never threatened while racing three wide. FIELD OFFICER was bumped soon after the start, raced well back outside, angled into the two path
early on the turn and passed tiring rivals. MONYINTHEBANKSEY broke slowly, saved ground and never threatened. BOLTER had brief speed two wide.
CONFUSION made a five wide gain around the turn and tired in the drive. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL played no factor while racing three and four wide.
WILD WINE was bumped just after the start, saved ground and was outrun.
