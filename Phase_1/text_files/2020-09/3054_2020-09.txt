ADHHAR trailed the field early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane, drove past the leader near the sixteenth pole and drew away
while geared down in the final stages. WYOMING CONQUEST stalked the pace early, made a bid three wide into the lane, took over and drew clear near
the eighth pole, was overtaken near the sixteenth pole and yielded in the final stages. STRIKE pressed the pace early, was in the three path into the lane
and weakened late in the stretch run. PRIORITIZER was bumped at the start, set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and faltered in the stretch
drive. MONEY COMETH broke out at the start and was done early. HARPER was through after a half.

Footnotes
JOHNY'S FIREBALL saved ground from midpack, split foes decisively at the five furlong pole to bid for the lead two wide and between horses at the nine
sixteenths pole, vied around the far turn before forging an advantage turning for home, drew clear approaching the furlong pole, shifted inwards, then held
ETHICAL JUDGEMENT's late surge at bay. ETHICAL JUDGEMENT lied close to the pace two wide and between horses around both turns, shifted three
wide outside of the leaders turning for home, then grinded away through upper stretch before quickening in the final furlong, surged approaching the wire,
but missed. COMMAND CENTRAL set the pace along the inside, held an advantage from a pair of foes into the far turn, but was headed by the eventual
winner at the quarter pole, then kept on through the lane, regained ground on the tiring leader in the final furlong as ETHICAL JUDGEMENT surged past,
but failed to regain even terms. NO OBLIGATION raced forwardly placed three to four wide and outside of foes around both turns, but only produced a mild
grind. S MAN hesitated at the start, raced far off of the pace three wide around the far turn before swinging five wide turning for home, but failed to factor.
MR. PETERKIN saved ground off of the pace, but was blocked behind traffic while shifting out turning for home and through upper stretch, then failed to
make an impact. LOUISVILLE LEGEND stalked the pace along the inside, but failed to produce a bid before weakening. BANDERAS was caught four wide
into the first turn before tucking two wide around that bend, then was between horses around the far turn, and failed to factor. THROWN FOR A LOUPE
pressed the pace two to three wide around the turns, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole, and stopped through the lane. RESPONDED was
off slowly, trailed throughout, and was outrun.

in upper stretch, forged that position, then held it from BOURBON TRAIL through the final furlong. BOURBON TRAIL raced far off of the pace two wide and

Footnotes
PICKFORD tracked the leading group from midpack, rallied four wide around the far turn to bid for the lead turning for home, drew clear approaching the
furlong pole, and held firmly through the late stages. URBANITE raced far off of the pace two wide around the first turn, shifted to the four, then five, path at
the five sixteenths pole, and rallied outside of foes through the lane, but was fended off by the leader through the late stages. SOCIAL AFLEET saved
ground far off of the pace around the turns, shifted four wide turning for home and stayed on between horses, then altered course inwards to attempt an
inside bid, but flattened out and got outfinished for place. RAYO DE LUZ set the pace along the inside, held a margin into the turn, but was headed by the
eventual winner in upper stretch, and gave way. MARTIAL EAGLE trailed, swung six wide turning for home, and passed tired foes. MAJORS VINDICATION
stalked three wide, bid for the lead turning for home inside of PICKFORD, but was outkicked by that foe and failed to keep pace with the leader in upper
stretch, then steadied slightly passing the furlong pole while tiring. DADDY'S ON STRIKE pressed the pace two wide, but weakened under an all out drive at
the five sixteenths pole. ROCK ON KITTEN stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid before weakening through the lane.

Footnotes
OAK HILL prompted the pace two wide, forged an advantage passing the quarter pole, inched clear through midstretch, and held sway under driving
pressure. FALKIRK stalked three wide, but only produced a grinding rally through the lane, did not have enough to catch the leader, but held place in the
late stages from an oncharging foe. IN LOVE (BRZ) was bumped by an inner foe at the start and was off poorly, trailed the field into the far turn, advanced in
the four path before swinging six wide in upper stretch, and rallied outside of foes through the lane for show. BULLSEYE BUN saved ground in midpack
around the turns before shifting four wide turning for home, and produced a mild rally between horses for a minor reward. ATTORNEY TIM saved ground far
off of the pace around the first turn before taking the far turn in the two path, then shifted out in midstretch, and rallied belatedly between horses.
UNTRACEABLE set the pace along the inside, held an advantage from the eventual winner around the far turn, but was headed by that foe passing the
quarter pole, and weakened through the final stages. ICON stalked the pace inside of a rival while in about the two path, but failed to produce a bid, chased
the leaders through the lane, and was outfinished for minor rewards. RANSACK raced far off of the pace two wide and failed to factor. BOTSWANA TAPS
bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace two wide, advanced to midpack into the far turn before swinging five wide turning for home, but
tired through the lane. ORO DE TEJANO saved ground off of the pace, but weakened around the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
MY DESTINY shied a bit from an outer foe at the start and trailed the field early on, saved ground around the turn before swinging seven wide at the quarter
pole, then rallied stoutly outside of foes through the lane, drove past the leader at the sixteenth pole, and cleared off. TREATY OF PARIS prompted the
pace and vied two wide and between horses, drew clear in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer surging rival at the sixteenth pole, and was second
best. ORENCIA pulled to be forwardly placed two wide and between horses, tipped three wide and outside of TREATY OF PARIS in upper stretch, but
chased that foe home and was outfinished by an outer rival. CREATIVE LEGACY saved ground off of the pace before shifting four wide and between
horses in upper stretch, then stayed on after shifting back in. SHESALITTLE EDGY tracked from midpack in the four path, but failed to factor. CHARMED
ONE prompted the pace three wide, but weakened turning for home. HOPECANDIESGOOD stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid before
weakening. PRETTY PLUM set the pace inside of a pair of rivals, but lost the lead passing the quarter pole, and wilted through the lane. NOW PLAYING
showed little and was eased through the lane.
