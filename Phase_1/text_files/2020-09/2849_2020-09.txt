Footnotes
AMERICAN PHENOM grabbed the lead after the start, rated along inside through a moderate pace, and was driving to stay clear. SEVEN CHANNELS
chased outside the winner from the start, could not cut into the margin through the lane and was clear for the place. HIGH DEFF (FR) hit the right side of the
gate at the start, was reserved inside for six furlongs, shifted out with aim at the leaders turning for home, and had no rally. PRECISE got bumped by
NOTHINBUTABLUR at the start, and was no factor. NOTHINBUTABLUR ducked into the left side of the gate and bumped PRECISE at the start, ran up
behind rivals and took up sharply leaving the first turn, was taken outside and had nothing. ROLLING LOUD was forwardly placed early three wide, and
tired. SPLIT CHANCE dwelt at the start, stumbled badly coming out, and never made contact with the field.

Footnotes
MAYSTART was never far back, took over outside BELLA SERENA midway on the turn, opened up under a drive through upper stretch, and was geared
down the last 70 yards. MISS MIKAELA bumped with DOITTOGETHER at the start, advanced three wide on the turn, and ran on clearly second best.
FEARLESS IDEAS raced four then three wide around the turn, shied out from left-hand pressure late, and held the show. IRAZU raced five then four wide
around the turn, and tired after a half-mile. PRETZEL showed brief speed inside, and stopped after a half. BELLA SERENA vied inside MAYSTART heading
into the turn, and retreated after a half. TREES THUNDER broke slowly and was always outrun. DOITTOGETHER hit the left side of the gate and bumped
MISS MIKAELA at the start, showed brief speed between horses, and stopped soon after completing a quarter-mile.

Footnotes
ALWAYS SHOPPING settled in striking range three wide for six furlongs, was roused approaching the quarter-pole, rallied outside BIENVILLE STREET and
got up despite being brushed and pushed out late by that rival. BIENVILLE STREET saved ground behind the leaders to the far turn, moved out two wide
nearing the stretch, caught CROWN AND SUGAR from outside and edged away through the furlong grounds, drifted out brushing and pushing out
ALWAYS SHOPPING, and could not hold that foe off. KELSEY'S CROSS broke slowly, was forced to go five wide around the far turn, and was clear for the
show with a willing finish. CROWN AND SUGAR set an even pace inside, got collared in upper stretch by BIENVILLE STREET, and gave way. MAKEME
DREAM was no threat through an even effort saving ground. GREAT SISTER DIANE raced four wide around the far turn, and could not gain. SENSIBLE
MYTH prompted the pace two wide for six furlongs, and tired.

Footnotes
NENITA brushed the right side of the gate coming out, dueled outside MIAHSOLOMIAH early, drew clear past the three-eighths, moved inside and widened
under a drive. FIERY PRINCESS tracked outside the dueling leaders, could not menace the winner and was clearly second best. G T'S BLUE SQUALL hit
the left side of the gate at the start, was outrun for three furlongs, rallied between horses in upper stretch and went clear of the others. MIAHSOLOMIAH
was a step slow at the start, rushed up inside to duel with NENITA, and weakened midway on the turn. TRINNI SUNSHINE raced two to three wide around
the turn, and tired. BORROWED ANGEL saved ground to no avail. FINA brushed the right side of the gate at the start, struggled to keep pace three then
four wide around the turn, and retreated.

Footnotes
BETTERTHENYOURX saved ground behind the leaders on the turn, moved out in search of room at the top of the lane, rallied through traffic splitting
horses a sixteenth out, and edged clear. DINNER AT FIVE went along behind and between horses on the turn, moved out four wide for the drive and rallied
outside. COOKIE COVE vied up front three then two wide to the stretch, stayed on willingly but was overhauled from both sides. SENSE A MILLION was
outrun to the stretch four then five wide, and gained late on the far outside. BROADWAY PEGGY lagged well back inside to the lane, moved to the two-path
and had some late interest. TREVESS pressed the pace four wide to the stretch, and weakened. GRAN DIAMOND vied for early command between
horses, and faded after three furlongs. BABY ALIDETT broke slowly and was outrun. WILD ABOUT THIS broke slowly and was never close. DE PURA
SANGRE set a pressured pace inside several pursuers, and faltered in the final furlong. MARVA was always outrun. TWO CENTS WORTH was no factor
four wide.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT GEM stayed in range early, came four wide off the turn, rallied determinedly outside NATIONALIST, and wore that rival down near the
sixteenth-pole to win going away. NATIONALIST took over after a half-mile, fended off a bid from THE GOSPEL OF JOHN around the turn under a drive,
was clear through the furlong grounds inside, but could not hold off the winner. UPSY DAISY DO was outrun for six furlongs, came wide into the lane, and
was up outside KAUFY FUTURES for the show. KAUFY FUTURES put in a mild bid along the rail after a half, was outpaced around the turn, and faded
late. BIZ MAKER was never a factor. THE GOSPEL OF JOHN rushed up past the five-eighths and steadied between horses, regrouped and went around
with a four-wide run on the far turn, but faded steadily through the drive. CAPELINE stumbled at the start, vied inside ROSALDA early, and stopped.
ROSALDA contested the early pace outside CAPELINE, and stopped after a half. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
SAILING SOLO took command after an alert start, rated along inside to the stretch, and was merely hand urged and shown the whip to stay in control.
LOUDER THAN BOMBS saved ground behind the leaders for six furlongs, had aim in the two-path turning for home, and could not cut into the margin while
best of the rest. GALLEON MAST was strung out four wide throughout, and lacked a solid final bid. STIRLING DRIVE was reserved early behind horses at
the back, remained in arrears three wide around the far turn, and improved outside without becoming a factor. COWBOY'S HERO alternated between the
rail and the two-path, and failed to make his presence felt. IDENTIFIER raced three wide, and tired after six furlongs. CHEYENNE'S COLONEL prompted
the pace outside SAILING SOLO for six furlongs, and gave way into the lane. SCRAPS was three wide early, took the far turn in the five-path, and made no
headway. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
INDEPENDENT MISS pressed the pace three wide, challenged outside MANDAMUS with five-sixteenths remaining, gained the upper hand after
straightening away into the stretch, and drove off. MANDAMUS sprinted clear early, came under attack from two pursuers on the turn, yielded to the winner
in upper stretch, and salvaged second. PRINCESS BETTY pressed the early pace, lodged a mild bid between horses after a half-mile, but weakened
through the stretch. TRUE ATKA swung five wide approaching the stretch, and could not gain. VICTORY CRUSADE veered out sharply at the start, moved
inside up the backstretch, and was never close. BAREBACK FUN rushed up along the rail into tight quarters behind MANDAMUS early, and was finished
after a half.

Footnotes
LIGHT FURY prompted the pace outside DEBBIE'S ROAD, took over after six furlongs, moved inside at the top of the stretch and drew away under a mild
drive. GUN OF GLORY saved ground in easy striking range, moved to the three-path past the quarter-pole, and rallied to go clear for the place. ESTILO
PELIGROSO was well back early inside, advanced on the far turn three then four wide, moved in through the furlong grounds, and was up inside GUACO
for the show spot. GUACO moved up three then four wide after six furlongs, but could not sustain the rally and was outkicked for third. SWEET GIANT was
no threat inside. POWER (BRZ) was forwardly placed two to three wide early, and lacked a late response. HIGHWAY FLYER was bumped from both sides
at the start and slow to begin, went four wide on the first turn, and never reached contention. GROOMSMAN was outrun inside. DEBBIE'S ROAD set the
pace inside for six furlongs, yielded to the winner at the top of the lane, and retreated. PACHANGA PATROL was outrun through a four-wide trip. RICKY
RUN became fractious behind the gate, loaded without the rider, broke in hitting the left side of the gate and bumping HIGHWAY FLYER, went six wide into
the first turn, was pulled up far behind after a half, and walked off.
