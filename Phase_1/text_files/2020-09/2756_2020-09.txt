hustled off to a big lead was run down on the far turn proving no match for one while holding the others well safe through the lane. TRUENO moved up on
the backside chasing on the turn weakening in upper stretch needing all to hold spot late. ABE tracked a loose leader through the backside making no
headway on the far turn before weakening in upper stretch. PLAY'EM OR FOLD'EM dropped well back early improving past tired ones down the lane.
WOODBURN HALL played no factor. CLASSIC HEATH chased on the backside giving way on the far turn having nothing left in upper stretch.

Footnotes
READY TO PLAY sent clear set the pace through the turn widening in upper stretch holding safe the final eighth. NACHO LOVER gained on the turn
coming five wide in upper stretch rallying while angling in late. DADDYS REAL DIVA chased the pace pressing on the turn, dispatched by the winner in
upper stretch would weaken. ROJO ROCKS saved ground finishing evenly along the inside. FLEETING KITTY slow early played no factor.
MELODRAMATIC was never involved. ROCK ICE folded up on the turn. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF FLEETING KITTY AGAINST THE RIDER
OF READY TO PLAY FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE START WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
