Footnotes
HALOS SIGN broke alertly inside, lead field through the stretch drive and held sway. BRIGHT FOO FIGHTER dueled inside of SPICY CHILE into the stretch
and held gamely for place honors. SPICY CHILE stumbled leaving, gained ground outside, rallied outside but was unable to get back inside rival and settled
for show. BOUND TOO BE FIRST broke outward and rallied steadily outside. TIMBERS EXPRESS broke slow and gave best late under urging.
NORTHFORKHIGH fractious in gate, showed early speed then evened out. GONE TO THE DARKSIDE broke in leaving the gate, angled out at the top of
the stretch and faded. MELODY MOONSHINE offered little. HE FLYS BYE NIGHT always outrun. SEPARATE CRUISES loaded without the rider then
broke slow and failed to recover from the start.

SARAHS ELEGANCE checked leaving the chute, moved up into striking distance outside, went in pursuit of the leaders under steady heavy urging, angled
outwards then got by just in time. OUT FRONT chased the pace while three wide through the backstretch, moved up alongside LIA'S ON TUNE to
challenge the lead, edged away at the top of the stretch but was caught late. SNEAKY SISTER rated off the pace in the two path, coaxed through the far
turn and passed tiring rival late. LIA'S ON TUNE cleared to the lead then showed the way through the backstretch, was challenged by OUT FRONT in the
final turn and wilted early stretch. INSTANT WYN hurried away and was outrun. SPIN A TALE steadied leaving the chute and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CARRAMIAMINE vied inside early, contested the pace through the final turn then was put to a drive entering the lane and held safely. ENTITLED STAR
allowed to settle early, came four wide into the lane, chased the winner through the stretch and held for second. PHINALYWYN rated off the pace while four
wide, advanced inside through the final turn, moved up menacingly entering the stretch and lacked the closing response needed. ASTARTOBE vied
between rivals then was squeezed out entering the far turn, circled into the lane then drifted outward under light handed urging and made mild improvement
late. BONNIE TRADER brushed leaving the gate then vied three to four wide, dropped back leaving the backstretch and faded gradually. POP'S LITTLE
GIRL sent for outside speed, angled in into the far turn moving up to challenge the eventual winner, was overtaken and yielded. DURA'S HALO unhurried
early, tracked outside entering the far turn, chased from the quarter pole then drifted through the stretch and proved empty. MIXED MEDIA trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
TROOPER JENNY sat just off the pace from the three path, swept the lead in the final turn and was kept to steady handling while under some pressure late.
MOE'SANNIE prompted the pace from the rail, waited inside at the five sixteenth marker, chased the leader through the stretch but was unable to reach
winner and held for second. SKY DESTINY rated off the pacesetters, shifted outside through the backstretch, gained closer order in the final turn, gained
gradually through the drive under steady encouragement and missed. TACTICAL EDGE shook head leaving last from the gate then saved ground from the
back of the pack, launched a bid at the quarter pole and lacked a closing response. PARIS IN PLAY rated off the pace, offered a late mild bid and failed to
improve through the drive. FIRST SAMARIA sat in range inside and lacked a serious bid. MI CHICA fractious in gate, set a pressed pace while two wide,
was quickly overtaken approaching the quarter pole then checked and faltered. *STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of
the race involving TACTICAL EDGE but made no change after review. **JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of MOE'SANNIE against
the rider of TROOPER JENNY alleging interference into the final turn was not allowed after review of the Stewards.

SAFFRIANO chased outside into the opening turn then drifted in brushing HUNTERS PRIDE, was roused three wide at the head of the lane, kept on
outside under left-handed urging and drove by with time. GABBY hustled to the front, was under attack into the lane, rallied determinedly and was worn
down late stretch. DOCSLASTJOKE broke in leaving the gate, tracked inside then waited for running room into the final turn, asked to quicken entering the
lane but lacked running room inside, steered out sharply mid stretch and missed out. GRANDMA JO away slow, chased wide into the first turn, remained
wide at the quarter pole and rallied steadily through stretch. COOL BREEZE lacked a clear path leaving, saved ground inside through the turn, lodged a bid
into the stretch and finished evenly. CODE OF THE WEST hustled away, dropped back leaving the backstretch and offered a mild late bid. HUNTERS
PRIDE vied outside for the early lead but was out sprinted to the turn, was brushed in the turn and faded gradually. CUZ IM A DANCER chased into the far
turn and had no response when called upon. CLOVER BAR offered little. PUMPKIN PIE sat mid pack while five wide and was outrun.

MR. KALYPSO saved ground while showing the way through the backstretch, took some pressure into the far turn inside of CANDY GIANT, turned back
challenge into the lane and held safely. RUCK sat just off the pace while three wide, chased the leaders through the far turn, could not reel the pacesetter
but continued on evenly under a drive and proved second best. OUR DANDY'S BOY rated well off the pace outside, went in pursuit of the pacesetters from
the quarter pole, gained through the stretch and missed. CANDY GIANT prompted action while five wide leaving the backstretch, moved up closer to
challenge the lead but was unable to stall the winner and gave way late stretch. A. F. INDY trailed the field early, gained closer order under coaxing and
offered a late mid bid. WHERE'S THE GOLD raced near the back of the field and showed little. ANELLO sat mid pack inside and retired early. STAPLETON
under a snug hold leaving the opening turn along the rail, sat in range into the far turn and had no response.

SLEWMACH saved ground in the early stages, advanced quickly through the final turn, swung out three wide in pursuit of the leaders, rallied gradually
outside through the drive and was along in time. RISING REVOLUTION contested the early pace, dueled from the far turn into lane inside of THIS TIME
LUCKY, gained advantage over rival and was rundown. THIS TIME LUCKY contended the early pace outside, dueled outside of RISING REVOLUTION,
was unable to sustain the bid that was needed through the drive and weakened late. ADRIEN'S AURORA rated well off the pace while outside, chased from
the two path into the final turn and finished evenly. PRESS GANG sat in striking range early, chased the pacesetters in the far turn and failed to threaten in
the drive. VISION QUEST tracked from the three path early and had no response when called upon. YORKTOWN always outrun. HERE COMES BARNEY
showed little.**JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of ADRIEN'S AURORA against the rider of SLEWMACH alleging interference in the
final turn was not allowed.

Footnotes
THIN LINE dueled for the early lead outside of HORST, inherited the lead into the far turn, responded to looming threat from BOLSANO and won driving.
BOLSANO allowed to settle mid pack early, shifted out three wide in the final turn, moved up menacingly approaching the stretch but was no match for the
winner and held place. CASH REWARD never far back from the three path then was put to a drive at the three sixteenth pole but was unable to improve
contending position through the drive. SMALL VICTORIES chased leaving the backstretch and rallied belatedly inside. MY SAMURAI WARRIOR unhurried
early, tracked outside through the backstretch, raced in traffic leaving the final turn and failed to menace. KIWITAHI chased wide and failed to improve
through the drive. INDICATIVE trailed the field and lacked a serious bid. TRANSPLANT away quickly then sat just off the pacesetters early, went in pursuit
of the leader at the three eighths pole and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. HORST sent hard for speed inside, set a pressure pace and stopped.
