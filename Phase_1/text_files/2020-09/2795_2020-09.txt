Footnotes
SAMBORELLA away in good order, established command in short order, was on cruise control setting lively splits from along the inside route, shook free of
the primary pursuer as the half was being completed, proceeded along handily opening up on the competition down the lane, took bad steps in the shadow
of the finish line, suffered an injury to her left front crossing it, was pulled up quickly and subsequently vanned off. MAKE MISCHIEF pursued the top
straddling the right rim of the inside route, got cued swinging to the outside heading home, ended the maneuver in the three path, had a good finish down
the center of the strip gaining real estate on the unasked winner. INFRINGEMENT bumped lightly with ROSSA VELOCE after stumbling badly at the start,
got guided over to the rail midpoint on the backstretch, went on to finish a non-threatening third. ROSSA VELOCE bumped lightly with INFRINGEMENT
right after the field had been released, attained a forward position, accompanied SAMBORELLA from path two for the opening half before giving way.
SUMMER BREW chased the pace two to three wide on the turn, got sent out four wide for the drive, backed away. QUEEN ARELLA gathered after
breaking to the outside, sat parked out three wide on the opening bend, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, ventured onward as the widest of
all, retreated.

JUDGE N JURY brushed the off side stall at the start and came under coaxing to show the way crossing to the two path shortly after the start, settled in
hand through swift splits, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive,
dug in and held safe to prevail, then returned in some minor distress, having his right front leg looked at and was subsequently vanned off. WORK OUT
lunged at the start seemingly mimicking the motion of the assistant starter's leg kick, then got bumped by DEVIOUS MO who broke inwards, came under
coaxing and ranged up inside to be forwardly placed, tipped two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide
for home and ran on to secure the place honors. MASKED MARAUDER hustled from the gate, chased three to four wide under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home and offered up a mild kick. DEVIOUS MO broke in at the start bumping WORK OUT, chased just off the
inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on for the last
major share. SARATOGA FLASH three to four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the
drive. SKIPPINGANDAJUMPIN hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and
passed tired foes. RE CREATED broke out at the start and was corrected, chased four to five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled six wide into
upper stretch and offered no response. BOHEMIAN RUBY chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. PRODUCTION CREDIT just off the pace two to three wide, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled four to five wide into
upper stretch and tired. BREAKING STONES broke in at the start filling the gap left by the breaking inwards DEVIOUS MO and brushed that rival, chased
just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
CHESTERTOWN was bumped soundly on both sides at the start and bounced around a bit while last away, went three then four wide under a snug hold on
the first turn, moved up late on that bend, stalked the pace on the outside under restraint, was let out in the three to four path on the far turn then asked at
the five-sixteenths, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, took the lead into upper stretch then was challenged by the runner-up outside the eighth-pole,
dueled with that foe in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. CITY MAN was away well from the outside post, showed no interest in
the early lead, went around the first turn in the three path under restraint, was rated just off the pace under a very snug hold while kept in behind horses by
the winner, drafted two then three wide early on the far turn, was given his cue inside the five-sixteenths then shifted four wide, rallied outside into upper
stretch, made a bid outside of the winner inside the three-sixteenths, battled outside that foe in the final furlong and missed while well clear for the place.
MORE GRAYTFUL was hustled to the front, contested the pace on the inside, was asked near the five-sixteenths, spun into the two path outside the
quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was well clear for third. TURBO
DRIVE bobbled at the start then bumped solidly with a rival, was taken under a tight hold while inside on the first turn, settled at the rear on the backstretch,
was urged along while inside on the far turn, angled three wide late on that bend and failed to respond. SKY OF HOOK broke in and bumped soundly with a
foe then was hustled, moved up four wide on the first turn, contested the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, dropped back
passing the five-sixteenths and faded.

Footnotes
STEP DANCER remained stationed along the inside route after the field had been sent off and running, patiently tracked the front runners towards the back
of the pack for over three-quarters, angled into path five for clearance entering the stretch, kicked in with good energy, readily chopping away at the deficit,
forged to the front approximately a sixteenth down the road, drew clear, under a hand drive late. PIVOTAL RUN caught leaning to the outside at the start,
steadied to avoid another right afterwards, moved inward, travelled towards path two on the clubhouse bend, stepped onto the next turn one path farther off
the rail, tipped into path four at the five-sixteenths marker in preparation for the stretch run, got driven onto the head of the stretch, poked a head in front in
the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, began the final furlong with the winner full of momentun and bearing down hard from the outside, relinquished
after going another sixteenth, stayed on for the place. ARROWHEART underwent a two wide pursuit, swung out four wide stepping into the lane, had to
settle for third after flattening out late. MARTINEZ tracked the front runners while saving ground, shifted into the two path at the commencement of the
stretch drive, weakened. CHROME DIXIE cut over to the rail on the homestretch, chased the pace fighting the bit while unsettled on the first turn, kept watch
from midpack, was on hold stuck behind others from the five-sixteenths marker to end of the second bend, managed to slither his way into the three path in
upper stretch, responded when given its cue, didn't get to flash the interest too long however, being forced to check off the heels of EIGHT WEEKS LONG
in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker, altered one path closer to the rail, went fairly evenly afterwards. HALPERT cut over to the rail, was involved in
a gap duel with BUSTIN BIEBER during the opening phases, got eased back after the first fraction had been finalized, tipped into path two and moved up to
re-engage the aforementioned foe, this time with EIGHT WEEKS LONG tagging along in path three, vied from between rivals for a good portion of the trip
on turn two, got tuided over to the inside at the top of the lane clutching the slimmest of leads, yielded to the second place finisher after a few additional
jumps, backed away steadily leaving the eighth pole. EIGHT WEEKS LONG three wide on both turns, moved in tandem with HALPERT as they hitched up
to BUSTIN BIEBER late on the backstretch, contended as the widest of three until the five-sixteenths pole, stepped into the lane, was already backing away
when steadied shying away from another in deep stretch. HURTGEN FOREST rode the rail one-paced, strolled into the two path for entrance into the
stretch, saw the pilot resort to a brisk hand ride with about a sixteenth pole, did some running for the initial time, then sustained that run all the way to the top
of the first turn and a little beyond. COUNT FROST strung out three wide on each bend, got sent out six wide from upper to midlane, had no offering.
BUSTIN BIEBER got going after losing his footing springing from the gate, vied from path two matched up HALPERT early, saw that one back off and slid
onto the rail, came under pressure from a pair of opponent soon afterwards, held them off until nearing the head of the stretch, retreated to last.

Footnotes
MYHARTBLONGSTODADY established the front and showed the way well rated along the inside through sensible well within her means splits, settled into
a rhythm patiently handled until placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the
eighth pole and held well to the finish. WEGETSDAMUNNYS tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun three wide for home and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. CLASSIC LADY came under a hard hold forwardly placed just off the inside
in closest aim of the leader, tucked inside seven-sixteenths from home, remained on hold until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, kept on
through to the finish and was along for the show honors. WAR CANOE three then two wide through the first turn, was placed to a firm hold just off the inside
behind the cover of her stable albeit not barn mate, remained on hold until roused angled four wide into upper stretch and made no headway. KREESIE
settled just off the inside at the tail of the compact field, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs out just off the inside,
angled five wide into upper stretch and came up empty unable to close with no pace to run into and no rivals coming back to her.

inside, had a rival cross in front inside the five-eighths, was urged two to three wide early on the turn, angled five wide outside the five-sixteenths, was
driven six wide into the stretch and improved position to get the show. TERCERO came in at the start then bumped lightly with a foe, was urged along off

Footnotes
THIN WHITE DUKE tracked the front runners from just off the rail, got cued up going two wide into the lane, altered course into path four in midlane, kicked
into his best shortly afterwards, began the final seventy yards on even terms with EAGLE ORB, out-dueled that opponent the rest of the way home to prove
best. EAGLE ORB shifted towards the outside on the backstretch, departed it from the three path, was in midpack taking up the chase on the turn, spun into
the lane under a strong drive, inched up to the one to catch, went by together with the winner inside the sixteenth pole, saw THIN WHITE DUKE edge away
belatedly. LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE broke on top and established control in short order, was in the middle of the strip pulling a bit on the bit leading the
competition during the opening phases, got guided over to the rail at the half mile pole, came into the lane, arrived at the three-sixteenths pole and was
called upon for more, got collared with slightly under a sixteenth to go, weakened into the show slot. MARKET ALERT went on to prompt LOOKING FOR
TROUBLE after bumping lightly with ALPHA CHI RHO at the start, went about the task two to three wide during the run around the bend, was more the
latter entering the stretch, kept up its pursuit in earnest for a little while longer then weakened. HOLD THE SALSA brought up the back of the pack, was
steered onto the inside route coming up to the end of the backstretch, got moved out three wide for the drive, made no headway. ALPHA CHI RHO secured
the pocket after making some contact with MARKET ALERT in the shadow of the starting gate, stepped into the stretch and faltered. EFFINITY three wide
entering the turn, sputtered towards path six exiting it, backed away.

Footnotes
MAKINGCENTS broke to the outside after losing her footing springing from the start, bumped into ICE PRINCESS hard then carried that foe out during next
jump before being corrected, recovered and grabbed the advantage, rated kindly showing the way from along the inside route, accompanied by
COURAGEOUS GIRL out in the two path, continued along under the same scenario until the end of the far turn, settled into upper stretch and was given her
cue, shifted towards the two path, came under siege from both sides beginning in the last eighth, saw her lead dwindle down in a steadfast manner, dug in
gamely to preserve the decision. ICE PRINCESS got momentarily pushed towards the outside after making solid contact with the winner at the start, wound
up making addition contact soon afterwards, got going and dove into the pocket coming up to the end of the homestretch, was patiently ridden keeping
watch on MAKINGCENTS from the pocket, was put to a drive cutting the corner into the lane, gained clearance along the rail a few strides later once the top
one had wandered into path two herself, launched a steady rail rally in the final furlong, loomed late, but got staved off by a rival equal to the task at hand.
SHARP STARR leapt into the right side, then got squeezed badly soon afterwards, capping off her rough beginning, cut over to the inside and rode the rail
on the first turn, tipped to the outside and into two path after stepping onto the backstretch, was still two wide leaving the half mile pole, struck the quarter
pole and angled four wide for the drive, narrowed in, enough so as to pose a threat by the furlong marker, chipped away at the deficit en route for the show
award. COURAGEOUS GIRL bumped in the shadow of the starting gate, assumed a prominent position, attended the pacesetter from the two path, was
switched over to stronger handling by the five-sixteenths pole, went into the stretch, kept up its pursuit in earnest until deep into the furlong grounds before
backing away. PLAYTONE bumped after the start, sat forwardly placed three wide for over six furlongs, shifted closer to the rail coming up to the
five-sixteenths pole, briefly waited in path two idling behind others in upper stretch, failed to fire when finally asked. CRITICAL VALUE one of six making
contact with others, either at or right after the start, worked out a tuck into the two path, was in between foes travelling on the first turn, was steered out into
path four for the trip on the far turn, got put to a drive at the five-sixteenths pole, commenced the stretch slightly closer to the inside, gave way.
MICROMILLION the only equine unscathed at he break, was strung out three wide on each bend, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, had no
response.

Footnotes
RINALDI a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, got away well and crossed inside soon after the start forcing GUCCI FACTOR to check off his heels,
grew keen under restraint establishing the front briefly before settling showing the way along the inside through the first turn, remained rated through
sensible splits down the backstretch along the inside facing no pressure, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole when coming under some pressure
for the initial time, swung three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, edged away to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish. DOT
MATRIX grew briefly fractious turning his head and had the assistant starter apply a two hand grip when the latch was sprung, tossed his head in response
from the motion of release under his chin and got away half a beat slow, tracked the pace along the inside unsettled early on through the first turn before
settling better down the backstretch, remained patiently handled until let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home
and procure the place honors. THERAPIST three wide through the first turn, chased two to three wide from just off the pace coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick for the show honors. GUCCI FACTOR got checked off the heels of RINALDI
as that rival crossed directly in front soon after the start, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild belated kick to be along for the last major share. RAPT grew a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, saved
ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths just off the inside, angled four wide for home and offered no response. BLEWITT
tracked the leader in closest aim from the two path under rating, came under urging at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened.
TWISTED TOM just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing three wide at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and
weakened.

Footnotes
SMITE was hustled from the start, contested the pace, vied inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, responded well when put to the whip in
upper stretch, battled with the runner-up in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. FRAT broke in then brushed with a foe, disputed the pace on
the outside then in the three path on the turn, was given his cue late on that bend, came under the whip in upper stretch, dueled with the winner into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished while just able to save the place. BOOM BOOM KABOOM settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused while
cutting the corner into the stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong, gained behind the top two into the final sixteenth then moved out and finished
with good energy to just miss the place while able to get the show. FREUDIAN ANALYST chased the pace down the backstretch, rounded the turn in the
two to three path, turned into upper stretch under the whip, pursued the top two in the drive and was out-kicked then missed the show. SHANDIAN brushed
with a foe at the start, settled towards the rear, raced in the two path early on the turn, was roused around the five-sixteenths then moved to three wide,
shifted out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. TEMPESTA settled off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, was
asked for his best while carried out in upper stretch and failed to rally. FLUENT IN SARCASM tracked the pace on the outside, was asked while four wide
on the turn, dropped back while still on his inside lead in upper stretch and capitulated. BEING ME was taken back early, settled well behind the rest of the
field, rounded the turn in the two path and was no factor. OTTER was hustled from the start, settled outside under some urging, came under stronger
encouragement in the four path on the turn and failed to respond. (Rail at 18 Feet)
