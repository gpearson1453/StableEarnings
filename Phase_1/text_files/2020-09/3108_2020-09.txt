the lane, made a bid in the stretch but did not have enough for place in the final stages. MADAM PIE chased the pace early, was in the five path into the
lane then bothered a bit down the lane and moved up in the late stages. LIGHT IN THE DARK came out at the start, set the pace early, was on the inside
into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. COLONEL ABY B was bumped at the start and trailed the field early on, raced along the inside into the lane
and improved position. WHAT'S THE MOVE pressed the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. SPEIGHTFUL

Footnotes
JACK'S ADVANTAGE stalked two wide, vied outside of DRINK around the far turn, then dug in between horses in upper stretch as MONEY FOR
MISCHIEF made a menacing bid and DRINK fought on, and battled back gamely between those foes in the final sixteenth to prevail under a long drive.
DRINK held a clear margin down the backstretch before holding an advantage from JACK'S ADVANTGE around the far turn, dug in inside of a trio of foes at
the quarter pole, got headed by the widest of them in upper stretch, fought back gamely through the lane to regain an advantage inside the final furlong, but
got nailed by another rival at the wire. MONEY FOR MISCHIEF rallied stoutly four wide around the far turn to drive past the inner leaders at the quarter pole,
forged an advantage in upper stretch, but hung, drifted out when the rider switched to left handed pressure in the final furlong, and got outfinished by inner
foes. HIDDEN TALENT stalked three wide, produced a three wide bid for the lead between horses at the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with those
rivals in upper stretch. GLORIOUS WEEKEND saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. APPROVED stalked the pace along the inside, but failed to
make a bid and chased the leaders through the lane before tiring. MIDNIGHT PATRIOT tracked from midpack in the two path around both turns, but failed
to make a bid before tiring. JUSTIN ZEE saved ground in midpack around the first turn, then took the far turn in the three path before swinging five wide
turning for home, but failed to factor, then failed to return to the winner's circle to be unsaddled, did so on the clubhouse turn, and was vanned off. WILD
WEEKEND stayed in the three path while far off of the pace around the first turn, then was through after a half mile, eased around the far turn, then walked
off.

Footnotes
REGAL BEAUTY stalked two wide and between horses early on, tipped three wide into the turn and bid at the three furlong pole when her hand was forced
by MAJESTIC BLEND, forged an advantage turning for home, drew clear in upper stretch, and held sway from PALIO FLAG through the final furlong.
PALIO FLAG lied close up inside of the pace setter down the backstretch, stalked that foe from the pocket around the turn, awaited racing room as others
made wide bids around the bend, shifted to the three path at the quarter pole to be behind the leader while still inside of KISS MORE, shifted that foe out
when tipping out at the three sixteenths pole, then sustained a rally to produce a bid, but did not have enough to catch the clear leader. GERRI B prompted
the pace three wide, then vied two wide and between horses around the turn, but failed to keep pace with REGAL BEAUTY in upper stretch, then PALIO
FLAG at the furlong pole, but kept on through the lane to secure a minor reward. KISS MORE stalked inside, then two wide around the turn, got floated to
the four path while between horses approaching the quarter pole, then brushed five wide passing that marker, and gave way in upper stretch. MAJESTIC
BLEND tracked four wide, produced a four wide bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, but was pushed six wide by inner shifting foes passing the quarter
pole, and weakened in upper stretch. ZANADU set the pace inside of a trio of foes into the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.
ENJOYITWHILEWECAN trailed throughout and was outrun.

Footnotes
SUGOI dueled for the lead inside of SABADOR (FR), opened up on the rest of the field with that rival down the backstretch, shook free from that foe in
upper stretch, and held safely through the lane under driving pressure. TIZZARUNNER saved ground off of the pace around the turns, and produced a rail
rally through the lane for place. SABADOR (FR) dueled for the lead outside of SUGOI while staying three to four paths away from his inner counterpart
around the first turn and down the backstretch, then shifted down to the two path around the far turn, but failed to keep pace that foe in upper stretch, kept
on through the lane, but got outfinished by an inner foe after flopping back to his left lead at the furlong pole. ON A SPREE tracked from midpack along the
inside, shifted to the four path turning for home, but hung on his left lead and only produced a mild rally. CRYPTO CASH settled far off of the pace in the
three path around the first turn, then cut the corner turning for home, and produced a belated rail rally through the lane. KAZIRANGA tracked the pace from
the three path, but failed to produce a bid before tiring through the lane. MOROCCO settled far off of the pace along the inside early on, got rank behind
foes into the first turn, then took the far turn in the six path before swinging to the six path in upper stretch, but failed to rally. ZAMBIAN was off slowly, raced
far off of the pace in the five path around the far turn, and failed to factor. INTRADAY (BRZ) stalked in the two path, but weakened in upper stretch. POWER
PLAYER hopped a bit at the start, raced far off of the pace in three to four path around the turns, and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
SWILL cleared off early on, stayed in about the two path around the turn as BIG LAKE inched closer in the latter half, responded to coaxing in upper stretch
to repel that foe passing the three sixteenths pole, the widened under driving pressure before being geared down approaching the wire. SANTA CRUISER
stalked in the four path, proved no match for the leader in upper stretch, but stayed on through the lane to edge place from a tiring foe approaching the wire.
BIG LAKE stalked the loose leader from the three path, inched closer around the turn, but was repelled by the pace setter passing the three sixteenths pole,
and got outfinished by an outer foe for place inside the final sixteenth. RACE CRAFT stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid and chased the
leaders home. SCARLET FUSION settled far off of the pace, took the turn three wide, and stayed on mildly through the lane without threatening. POLISHED
CHROME trailed the field down the backstretch and into the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly outside of SCARLET
FUSION, but failed to menace. RUNWAY MAGIC was off slowly, got rank behind rivals while along the inside early on, advanced to midpack and saved
ground from that position around the turn, but tired through the lane. WICK saved ground far off of the pace around the turn, and didn't play a factor. MAN
ON THE MOON brushed the gate, tracked from midpack in the five path, but weakened in upper stretch. BOURBON FRONTIER tracked from midpack in
the three path between horses, then far off of the pace two wide and between horses around the turn, and did not factor.
