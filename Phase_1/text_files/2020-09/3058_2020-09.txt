MISS EARL away alertly and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down
the backstretch and through the final turn, and held off HE'S RELENTLESS, following a stretch long battle to prevail. HE'S RELENTLESS broke sharply and
pressed the leader one out from the rail entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backside and through the final
turn, and just missed following a stretch long battle while finishing two out from the rail in a game effort. DAY TREK was off a step slow, but raced into a
stalking trip one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in the
stretch drive. MISSY'S PADRAIG stalked the leaders at the back of a compact field while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the
inside entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact when called upon.

CHEF unhurried early while dropping back to trail, began to advance from just off the rail midway down the backside, rallied along the rail entering the final
turn, shifted two wide entering he lane to assume command, and quickly drew clear. SQUARE DANCER broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the
early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and closed one out from the
rail in the drive to prove easily second best. LITTLE GROOT away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, dictated
the pace from along the rail in the run down the backside, opened a clear advantage approaching the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, and
steadied when put in tight quarters at the rail, and faltered in the late stages. ACE DEUCE tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing
two out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, but failed to respond when called upon entering the final turn. GENOA BAY
away well and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch,
but began to weaken approaching the final turn.

through the final turn, took control entering the lane, and held off a late charge by RANGER UP to prevail. RANGER UP trailed the field into the backstretch
while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, shifted three wide midway through the turn, and closed with a rush one out
from the rail in the drive to just miss. SLEW'S BAK settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his
bid three wide through the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the stretch drive to get up for a share. CASCADE BILLY broke sharply and dueled
for the lead one out from the rail entering the backstretch, forced the issue two wide through the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on the winner in the

Footnotes
MUSTACHIO rushed up through the stretch the first time to track the leader into the second turn while saving ground at the rail, tipped two wide
approaching the final turn, and saved ground at the rail through the turn, and finished willingly one out from the rail in the drive to prevail. SANAWAR
unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive
to come up just short. WISE MARKET away alertly and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his
position in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering he final turn while battling for the lead, but was outfinished late while racing two out from the
rail to prove best of the rest. JACK'S REIGN tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering
the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive. MOLESLEY was forced to steady when in tight quarters passing the wire the first time and then again
racing into the first turn, settled well off the early pace in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing
response when called upon. THE ALL BUTTON broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, dictated the pace
in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken approaching the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was
a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of MOLESLEY lodged a claim of foul against the rider of MUSTACHIO for alleged interference approaching the first turn.
After review the claim of foul was upheld, and MUSTACHIO was disqualified from first and placed fifth.

Footnotes
NORTHERN GRAYSTAR away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the second turn and in the
run down the backstretch, maintained her advantage into the final turn, and widened her margin late under confident handling. SOLARITY broke sharply and
tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and closed one out from the rail
in the drive to hold the place. BUTTERSCOTCH BLEND away alertly and tracked the leader one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied
from just off the rail entering he final turn, and closed willingly from along the inside in the drive and shifted three wide late to just miss the place. FULLY
LENT stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, saved ground throughout, but lacked the needed closing response
when called upon. WARRIOR'S PROMISE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

overtaken entering he lane and finished from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. LA BELLE FLEUR settled off the early pace while racing three

into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. Following the
running of this race, ADAPTABLE appeared to pull up in some distress, but walked off the track under her own power. LOTS OF LOVE away alertly and
vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run to the final turn, saved ground through the final turn, but faded in
the late going. OUR ANJA stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but had
little to offer late. ROSBERGS GIRL unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide through the final turn, but needed more when called upon.
PUDDLES settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon.

Footnotes
OMBRE' ROSE away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering he first turn, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane and inched clear late. DAY PASS away well and vied for the lead from along
the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and finished from along the
rail in the drive to hold the pace. DONE THAT rushed up two wide through the first turn to take a stalking trip into the backstretch, rallied one out from the
rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive in a solid effort. INTENT ON GOLD stalked the leaders into the backstretch while
racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished evenly four wide in the drive. PIPPA was squeezed and pinched back at the
start and trailed the field into the first turn, rallied smartly one out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed three out from the rail in the drive, but was
unable to overcome the troubled start. DEW TELL settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, continued with a wide trip
throughout, and lacked the needed closing response when called upon. COUNTESS WOW broke sharply and raced in tight quarters while brushing the rail
entering the first turn, dropped back on the run down the backstretch and had nothing to offer late.
