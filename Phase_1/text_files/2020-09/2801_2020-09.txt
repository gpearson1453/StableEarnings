Footnotes
BOURBON RESOLUTION trailed the field in the two path around the turn, commenced a rally in upper stretch as leading foes drifted wide, split the tiring
early pace setters at the furlong pole, progressed inside of outer rallying foes to forge an advantage at the sixteenth pole, and prevailed over an oncharging
rival. HOG CREEK HUSTLE tossed his head at the start, tracked from off of the pace, shifted to the four path approaching the five sixteenths pole, before
swinging to the seven path turning for home, produced a bid for the lead at the furlong pole, then sustained his rally in the final sixteenth, but was outfinished
by an inner surging foe. MIDNIGHT SANDS prompted the pace three wide, got floated to the six path turning for home while inching closer to produce a bid
in upper stretch, forged an advantage at the furlong pole, but hung on his left lead, then weakened late and was no match for an inner and an outer foe in
the late stages. HOME BASE set the pace from the onset, shifted outwards through the cute to discourage MIDNIGHT SANDS from pressing, which allowed
for ample room for SEVEN TRUMPETS to move up to his inside, dueled outside of that foe while in the two path into and around the turn, but drifted to the
four path at the quarter pole, and faltered through the lane. SEVEN TRUMPETS rushed under his own power along the inside down the backstretch to bid
for the lead inside of HOME BASE at the nine sixteenths pole, dueled insde of that foe around the turn, but was headed in upper stretch and weakened
through the final furlong.

ONE NATION prompted the pace outside MARSAC through the turn, took over entering the stretch, turned back the challenge of PIT BOSS near the furlong
marker and kicked away. PIT BOSS was allowed to settle, took closer order through the turn, wheeled out six wide entering the stretch, loomed large but
was unable to bridge the gap. FASTLY stalked the pace off of the inside to the stretch, angled in to make his bid, got through and was within striking
distance but flattened. STORM KING stalked the pace, commenced his bid four wide, but weakened between rivals. ABAAN was slow into stride, settled
toward the inside, mounted a belated improvement, but was bumped and carried out near the furlong marker and failed to threaten. MARSAC set the
pressured pace along the inside through the turn, tired entering the stretch, came out and bumped ABAAN a furlong out and retreated. DYNACHARGE was
allowed to settle, showed little, dropped well back, was pulled up near the eighth pole, bled and was vanned off.

Footnotes
ESSENTIAL QUALITY was urged along while racing in midpack down the backstretch, picked up stride and advanced on his own around the turn, loomed
behind the leaders turning for home, lacked room while trying to slit those foes in upper stretch, switched out to the three at the three sixteenths pole, then
sustained his rally to make a bid passing the furlong pole, and won going away. KING'S MISCHIEF prompted the pace three wide early on, then two wide
around the turn, inched forward leaving the turn to forge an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, cleared off an held an advantage passing the furlong
pole, but was no match for ESSENTIAL QUALITY approaching the sixteenth pole, then tired but held place. SANTA CRUISER was off slowly, saved ground
around the turn while off of the pace, advanced while shifting to the two then three path turning for home, split foes in upper stretch, but chased ESSENTIAL
QUALITY through the final furlong, and missed achieving place. RYE SENSE OF HUMOR raced far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, swung
to the six path turning for home, and produced a mild rally. COPLEY chased the pace from the two to three path around the turn before shifting four wide
turning for home to produce a bid, but failed to keep pace with the leading group in midstretch. COPA set the pace along the inside, cleared off at the five
furlong pole, shifted to the three path into the turn before angling back to the inside around the bend, but was headed by foes at the quarter pole, and
weakened. DEVIL'S TOWER stumbled at the start but was not cost position, pressed the pace two wide and between horses early on, shifted in and stalked
from the inside into the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leaders at the quarter pole. LOCK UP was forwardly placed three to four wide around the turn
before shifting five wide turning for home, but weakened on his left lead in upper stretch. T MONEY was bumped by an outer foe at the start, raced far off of
the pace two wide into the turn, and failed to factor. ME WE bumped an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the two path around the turn, and
never got involved. XIETELEHUAS was off slowly and outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
ON A SPREE stalked the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane, edged clear of foes near the three sixteenths pole and widened in the final
stages. CAVALRY CHARGE chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but was no match for the winner in the late
stages. SPANISH KINGDOM set the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. ATTORNEY TIM was unhurried early on,
raced along the five path into the lane with a belated gain in the stretch drive. TRIDENT HIT came in at the start and raced back early on, was in the five
path into the lane with some gain in the stretch. JOB SECURITY raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch
run. PARKLAND was never a threat. STAGE READY was through after three quarters. EL AHIJADO was bumped at the start, raced a bit keen while
between horses into the first turn and was through early. HANDY was bumped at the start, chased the pace early, was checked hard nearing the seven
sixteenths pole then folded up. LASTCHANCEATGLORY was never involved. MAJESTIC RO had early speed then retreated.

SIR ALFRED JAMES settled toward the inside, came under a ride entering the turn, made a sweeping move four wide, drew even leaving the turn, shook
clear and maintained a diminishing advantage. COASTAL DEFENSE was unhurried into stride, moved out leaving the turn, split rivals in upper stretch,
kicked on well but was unable to reach the winner. COOL BOBBY set the pressured pace along the inside, weakened during the drive but stayed on to
preserve the minor award. WILD POPIT was allowed to settle, shifted out entering the stretch and improved between foes. COWBOY DIPLOMACY
contested the pace outside COOL BOBBY to the final furlong and tired. WAYNE O pulled to contention off of the inside, leveled into stride in traffic, tipped
out but lacked a response when called upon. ALEX JOON tucked in to save ground, moved up along the rail, but came up empty entering the stretch.
STREET CLASS angled out early, went wide and was through leaving the turn. STILTS was close up between horses through the turn and dropped out.
HERSH saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
AURELIUS MAXIMUS prompted the pace three to two wide and between horses around the first turn, forged an advantage from his inner foe at the five
sixteenths pole while being engaged by BODEXPRESS to his outside, then repelled that foe approaching the furlong pole, and held sway through the late
stages under driving pressure. BODEXPRESS stalked four wide around the first turn before shifting three wide into the backstretch, prompted the leaders
from the outside down the backstretch before producing a bid for the lead outside of AURELIUS MAXIMUS turning for home, but was repelled by that foe
approaching the furlong pole, then kept on through the late stages to hold place. MR. QUALITY broke sharply and set the pace along the inside of a pair of
foes into the backstretch, but was headed by those foes passing the three furlong pole, then failed to keep pace with the leader at the quarter pole, but kept
on through the lane to hold show while missing reclaiming place. SIGNALMAN saved ground from midpack into the turn, shifted from the three to the five
path turning for home, then to the six path at the furlong pole, and surged between horses in the late stages, but missed show. CASINO STAR got keen in
to the first turn due to rider restraint to switch outside of the leader, failed to go on to prompt the pace around the first bend and decided to stalk from the
inside instead, shifted two wide turning for home, then to the four path at the furlong pole, but failed to produce a bid. LOCALLY OWNED raced far off of the
pace three wide around the turns, shifted to the six path in midstretch, but failed to rally. SAVVY raced forwardly placed three to two wide, shifted to the four
path to be outside of the leaders turning for home, but only produce a mild bid before tiring between horses in the late stages. CHESS CHIEF took the far
turn in the four to six path in midpack and failed to factor. ALL WEST had a slow start, raced off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, and
failed to factor. SAGAPONACK trailed in the four to ive path around the first turn and never got involved. AWARD WINNER was outrun along the inside.
TANK COMMANDER raced far off of the pace two wide, and never factored before being eased through the lane

RUSHIE stalked the pace in hand, ranged up three wide to engage the leaders leaving the turn, struck the front and shook clear nearing the furlong marker,
was kept to task and held safely. SONNEMAN was allowed to settle, came under a ride midway through the turn, angled out entering the stretch, was
fanned out further, kept on well but was unable to reach the winner. TAP IT TO WIN prompted the pace outside VERTICAL THREAT into the stretch, was
unable to go on with the winner then just failed to hold the place. SHASHASHAKEMEUP broke a step slow, was unhurried, got through and finished with a
belated improvement. ECHO TOWN was close up toward the inside, shifted out but flattened during the drive. VERTICAL THREAT set the pressured pace
along the inside, contested the issue to the final furlong and faded. DIGITAL contended three deep, was fanned wider still into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SITTIN ON GO raced far off of the pace behind rivals in the two path into the turn, advanced in the three to four path and outside of foes around the turn,
then shifted five wide turning for home, commenced a rally in upper stretch as MIDNIGHT BOURBON kicked clear, and drove past that rival at the sixteenth
pole. MIDNIGHT BOURBON stalked four to three wide, inched forward turning for home to produce a bid at the quarter pole, shifted inwards two the two
path while forging an advantage in upper stretch, quickly drew clear approaching the furlong pole, but was run down by the winner at the sixteenth pole, and
proved second best. SUPER STOCK lied close to the pace two wide and between horses early on, chased around the turn before shifting to the four path in
upper stretch, then stayed on for a minor share. THERIDEOFALIFETIME set the pace along the inside, held an advantage around the turn, but was headed
at the three sixteenths pole, and subsequently yielded. PICO D'ORO stalked the pace along the inside, but failed to keep pace while under a drive at the five
sixteenths pole, then stayed on mildly after shifting two wide, and pass tired foes in the lane. NOTARY prompted the pace three to two wide around the turn,
vied turning for home, but failed to keep pace with foes on both sides passing the quarter pole, and tired. ULTIMATE BADGER tracked from midpack three
wide, but came under a drive at the half mile pole, lacked a response to produce a rally, and failed to factor. CRAZY SHOT raced far off of the pace in the
four path around the turn, and never got involved. DROP ANCHOR trailed the field in the three path into the turn, then shifted to the six path in midtstretch
while failing to make an impact. BELAFONTE tracked from midpack along the inside, but weakened passing the three furlong pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
BEAU RECALL (IRE) was well placed early on, roused along the far turn, raced in the five path entering the lane, rallied down the stretch four wide, drove
past the leader with ease and cleared the field in the final stages. NEWSPAPEROFRECORD (IRE) set the pace from the outset, was in the three path into
the lane, widened near the eighth pole but was overtaken late in the stretch then yielded to the winner and held place safely in the final stages. LA
SIGNARE (FR) chased the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch and was slowly gaining on place in the final stages.
JULIET FOXTROT (GB) tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. DADDY IS A LEGEND was
unhurried early on, raced widest into the lane from the six path and moved up in the stretch drive. BELLE LAURA stalked the pace early along the inside,
was off the rail into the lane and empty in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BELL'S THE ONE settled in hand off of the inside, took closer order through the turn, moved out four wide entering the stretch, was full bore nearing the
furlong marker, caught SERENGETI EMPRESS approaching the sixteenth pole, slugged it out with that one stride for stride and prevailed by the narrowest
margin. The latter angled in leaving the chute, set cracking fractions to the stretch, inched clear, dug in valiantly but was turned away in the shadow of the
wire. SALLY'S CURLIN lagged well back, came under a ride leaving the turn, wheeled out six wide into the stretch and finished willingly to earn the minor
award. CE CE chased three deep, loomed a danger entering the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong and faded. WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY contended
toward the inside to the final furlong and gave way. BELLAFINA prompted the pace to the outside of SERENGETI EMPRESS through the turn, but came up
empty between rivals and retreated. SHESOMAJESTIC was forwardly placed along the inside to the turn and dropped out.

DIGITAL AGE (IRE) saved ground far off of the pace around the first turn and through the first half of the far turn, shifted to the three path at the five
sixteenths pole then five wide turning for home, and produced a grinding rally through upper stretch, collared the leader at the sixteenth pole, and edged
clear. FACTOR THIS set the pace along the inside of a pair of foes while taking the first turn in the two path, held an advantage around the far turn along the
rail, then shook free from pressing foes in upper stretch, drew clear through midstretch, but flopped back to his left lead while meeting DIGITAL AGE (IRE)'s
bid at the sixteenth pole, wher he was headed and proved second best. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, shifted to
the two then three path around the far turn, came into the lane behind rivals, altered course to the seven path at the furlong pole to be outside of those foes,
and stayed on late for a minor share. SACRED LIFE (FR) raced off of the pace two wide around the first turn, then swung from the four to the six path
turning for home to attempt a rally, but hung on his left lead through the lane, and only produced a mild kick. DONTBLAMEROCKET trailed the field, took
the far turn in the four path before swinging to the eight path in upper stretch, then produced a mild kick outside of foes, but failed threaten. SPECTACULAR
GEM prompted the pace three wide while in the four path around the first turn, then pressed in the three path around the far turn, but drifted to the four path
in upper stretch while failing to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch, and weakened. TRUE VALOUR (IRE) pressed the pace two wide and between
horses, vied for the lead turning for home, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch, and weakened in the final sixteenth. MR
DUMAS saved ground in midpack, shifted two wide and between horses turning for home, but failed to rally. SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN got rank crossing
the wire for the first time, raced forwardly placed two wide while pulling in the bit around the first turn, stalked around the far turn before tipping four wide to
be outside of the leaders turning for home, but lacked kick and weakened. BOWIES HERO stalked the pace along the inside, but failed to produce a bid
before tiring through the final furlong.

Footnotes
AUTHENTIC took command nearing the wire the first time well removed from the inside, stayed in the four path around the first turn while clear, maintained
a clear advantage down the backstretch and into the second turn, met the challenge of TIZ THE LAW inside the three-eighths pole, clung to a narrow lead
turning for home, brushed with that one near the three-sixteenths marker, turned back TIZ THE LAW approaching the furlong grounds, shook clear and held
steadily. TIZ THE LAW away in good order, was close up three wide into the turn, moved out five to six wide through the first turn, tracked outside in hand,
ranged up into far turn, engaged in earnest inside the three furlong pole, came to even terms just past the five-sixteenths marker, brushed with AUTHENTIC
in upper stretch, was rebuffed a furlong out but kept on willingly. MR. BIG NEWS tracked from mid pack three deep around the first bend, moved out to the
five path on the backstretch, came under a ride passing the seven-sixteenths, progressed five wide around far turn, drifted a bit when straightening, took aim
on the leaders into the lane, leveled off but fought on to preserve the minor award. HONOR A. P. hesitated at the start, was unhurried while four wide into
the first turn, looped into the back stretch six deep, made a steady sweeping move through the second turn, fanned into the nine path into the stretch,
continued on and was making progress. MAX PLAYER reserved off of the inside, moved out between rivals four to five wide on the far turn, churned on in
traffic and improved position. STORM THE COURT was well placed along the inside, attended the pace in hand through the second turn, drifted around a
bit through the stretch but failed to make headway. ENFORCEABLE was close up along the inside, was caught in tight and bumped with MAJOR FED into
the first turn, settled while well positioned, came under a ride at the half mile pole but toiled in vain. NY TRAFFIC tracked between foes inside TIZ THE LAW
into first turn, tipped out into the five path around the bend, stayed within range to the three furlong marker, tacked inward on the second turn, altered back
out nearing the quarter pole, but weakened once straightened for the lane. NECKER ISLAND was unhurried in the two to three path, moved out eight deep
into lane, drifted inward in the stretch and passed some tired ones. MAJOR FED was keen to place between foes, jostled into first turn, leveled into stride on
the backstretch while close up, was caught in traffic and altered course when NY TRAFFIC came out near the five-sixteenths pole, stayed on to the stretch
and tired. SOLE VOLANTE was squeezed at the start, was unhurried two wide through the first turn, settled along the inside but lacked a response.
WINNING IMPRESSION tucked in to save ground, settled in mid pack, lost position from the half to the quarter pole, wheeled out and passed a few.
MONEY MOVES was hard to place in traffic, bumped with MAJOR FED into the first turn, settled three deep between horses, but came up empty before
going a mile. ATTACHMENT RATE came in bumping SOLE VOLANTE at the start, was forwardly placed four to five wide, was put to pressure with
nine-sixteenths to run, but tired and steadily faded. SOUTH BEND lobbed along saving ground, commenced a drive into the second turn, shifted out six
wide and offered his bid, came eight wide, but caved and retreated.
