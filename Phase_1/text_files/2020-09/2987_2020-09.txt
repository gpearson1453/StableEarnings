Footnotes
MARRAZANO broke sharp from the outside, quickly gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the
second turn, wide the effort at the eighth pole and was well clear in a gate to wire effort. PORTABELLA MOON pressed the early pace from the inside,
remained forward for the drive but was no match for the winner while clearly second best. SANTA ANA WINDS stalked the early pace from the outside,
advanced through the second turn, responded and closed with a rush for the show. POSSE GONE WILD forced the early pace from the inside, made a bid
but was too late. NO MAS TEQUILA chased the early pace from the inside but came up empty in the drive. SHE'S A FINE DIME was no factor. QUEEN OF
CARNIVAL chased the early pace outside but had nothing left. NAVY REGATTA was never close. TIZ GOOD pressed the early pace inside and tired. THIS
IS MY PRAYER forced the early pace from the outside but gave way in the drive.

through the turn, remained forward but could not keep pace. FASHION ISLAND chased the early pace from the inside, made a bid along the rail and rallied
late. TIGER BAIT went evenly. WILDCAT SPRINGS could only pass tired ones. SILVER SQUALL chased the early pace and tired. CHESAPEAKE BAY
dueled from between foes and faded.
