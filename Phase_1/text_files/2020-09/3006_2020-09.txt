Footnotes
MORAVIAN PRAYER lacked speed, hugged the inner rail on the turn, remained inside horses through the stretch, took the lead near the sixteenth pole then
drew out. DEFY EXPECTATIONS , along the inner rail mid way on the turn, eased out to the three path leaving the bend, gained the lead in upper stretch
and was no match for the winner late. LIVE AID , four deep leaving the turn, rallied mildly and drifted in a bit near the sixteenth pole. PRINCESS ROSIE , a
forward factor along the inner rail leaving the turn, drifted wide in upper stretch and weakened. MIDSHIP LADY , rank at the break, trailed early, raced very
wide turning for home and passed tired horses. MELISANDE , three deep on the turn, failed to rally. YIRA , three wide on the turn, chased the pace to the
stretch then weakened. RIVER TRAPPE was not a factor. MAGIC IN MALIBU sped to the early lead, raced near the rail around the turn and faltered the
final quarter mile. There was a stewards inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

Footnotes
SUSIKIN bore out at the break, corrected and edged up three wide outside a pair of rivals to dispute the early pace, dueled outside CALYPSO GHOST
while holding a slim advantage around the turn, continued the battle past mid stretch, shook clear on her left lead and under pressure past the sixteenth
marker, switched to her correct lead late and widened. CALYPSO GHOST sped up to the inside and dueled inside rivals, emerged in a two-way fight around
the turn, sparred to about the sixteenth pole, faded but managed to save the place. LA SHIRIMP , four wide, edged up outside a rival into the turn, circled
four wide pursuing the duelers into the lane and churned on without making any headway. PARCHED GHOST bobbled slightly at the break, lagged off the
early pace, saved ground around the turn and into the lane and found her best too late. SILVER SIDES stumbled at the break and was away last, regrouped
and was taken in hand and towards the rail, came under pressure mid turn, swung out five wide for the drive and offered a mild kick. STATED lacked speed,
raced six wide in upper stretch, had a belated run but failed to threaten. NIGHTMARE chased the pace, raced three wide and between runners leaving the
far turn, shifted in some and tired. FANCY OUTFLANKER vied early between rivals, failed to keep pace past the three eighths and retreated.

Footnotes
GALERIO broke a step slow then was forced out a bit, corrected and settled about five wide past the three quarter pole, edged up a bit and dropped in a
path to bid four deep leaving the far turn, dueled outside rivals past the five sixteenths and into the lane, wandered outward under left handed rousing while
holding a short lead near mid stretch, was straightened with right handed rousing, edged away slightly in deep stretch then was all out to get the bob over
CROUCHELLI. CROUCHELLI , off the pace about two wide, moved up nearing the half mile marker, was under strong handling pursuing the four-way pace
battle leaving the five sixteenths, swung five wide for the drive, leveled off under left handed encouragement leaving mid stretch, kept on grinding but just
missed. MIAMI MUMBLES rated kindly three wide in closest pursuit of the leader, gained past the half mile marker, bid two wide between runners soon
after, battled past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. PAUL THE WAITER saved ground and edged up near the half mile marker, was put to strong
urging while chasing the leading quartet past the five sixteenths, eased out in the drive but lacked the needed finish. SEA GHOST broke outward, raced
three to four wide early on, took closer order into the far turn, bid three wide between foes, forced the issue to the lane then faded. JOSEF IS REAL opened
up early while tough to throttle down, set the pace two wide, moved to the rail into the far turn, met a trio of challenges soon after, maintained a slim lead
under a drive past the quarter pole, ceded command in upper stretch, stayed willingly to mid stretch then weakened.

WILLMAKEYOUHAPPY , taken to rate early about three wide, dropped in some and bid outside the leader entering the far turn, gained a slim lead soon
after while remaining in hand, dueled past the five sixteenths, responded when set down entering the lane, could not shake free but held firm under solid left
handed encouragement. FORFIFTYFIVEROCKET was sent clear soon after the break, set the pace towards the rail, was joined by the winner then headed
leaving the far turn, maintained a fighting position while under coaxing around the turn, continued the battle through the lane but wasn't quite good enough
in a valiant effort. MR. CHESAPEAKECITY broke a bit outward, quickly righted and was rated outside a rival mid turn, came four wide for the drive and
churned on to maintain the show. IN THE LOOP saved ground pursuing the duel but lacked a bid. TWIXY CAT , three wide between rivals leaving the far
turn, swung five wide into the stretch and had a mild run. THATWOULDBEGRAND broke slowly, was sent up between rivals soon after, eased back near
the half then took up sharply with about three furlongs remaining, swung very wide for the drive and offered a comeback through the final furlong. COOKE
BROTHERS saved ground under some urging, eased out near mid stretch but failed to rally. IRISHTOWN was steadied near the five eighths, angled out
and raced four deep leaving the far turn, edged up slightly past the five sixteenths, was fanned six wide into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
BUSTIN HEARTS , unhurried down the backstretch, floated to the five path turning for home, closed outside horses, led near the sixteenth pole and was
kept under pressure. CATERINA ONE chased the pace two wide around the turn, floated out in upper stretch, gained a short lead in mid stretch and gave
way grudgingly. MARKET MONEY saved ground on the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and rallied mildly outside horses.
THEATERINTHEROUND stalked the pace, raced in the four path turning for home and weakened. RAVENEL , five wide entering the stretch, drifted out
near the eighth pole. BUFF'S IN LOVE saved ground stalking the pace, had aim along the rail in mid stretch and gave way. BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD set
the pace along the rail, drifted out turning for home and gave way. PRINCESS KILLMAIN , outrun, raced wide and was fanned to the seven path in mid
stretch. EIFS was outrun. SUMMER FROCK , along the inner rail on the turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
KING'S HONOR (IRE) advanced outside rivals nearing the first turn and garnered a stalking spot, rated kindly while spying the leader past the five eighths,
took over with an outside bid near the half mile marker, spurted clear soon after and was nursed around the final turn, opened up after being set down in
upper stretch, drifted out through the final seventy yards despite efforts with the right stick, made contact with MR. D'ANGELO in the final jumps and
prevailed. MR. D'ANGELO , unhurried early while saving some ground, commenced a run near the five sixteenths, swung out for room entering the lane,
straightened to be five to six wide, made a bold run and just missed while being brushed in the vicinity of the wire. SPEED GAME , between foes near the
three quarter pole, chased under pressure while off the rail past the three eighths, shifted in through the drive and finished up willingly to bridge the gap.
COUSIN JIMMY broke a step slow then was sent up around the first turn to stalk three to four wide, advanced to be the closest pursuer of the winner
leaving the five sixteenths, was under heavy pressure into the lane but came up empty in the final sixteenth. SUPER E , off the pace and between runners
near the five sixteenths, made a mild run inside rivals. BENNY HAVENS settled off the pace while four wide, continued four wide around the final turn while
picking up momentum, sustained to about mid stretch then flattened out. UP AGAINST IT , four to five wide much of the way, failed to menace. TOM
HAGEN rated close up while saving some ground early on, edged up between rivals near the half mile marker, failed to kick on under pressure past the five
sixteenths and weakened. ROYAL CRUSADER saved ground while off the pace and failed to respond. ONCE MORE EH cleared into the first turn, dropped
in and set the pace, ceded command after a half mile and faltered. An objection by the rider of MR. d'ANGELO against the winner for alleged interference
near the wire was not allowed

COCONUT CAKE hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased to the two path in upper stretch, advanced inside horses, took the lead near the sixteenth
pole and dug in tenaciously. QUIET IMAGINATION lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn, swung to the six path turning for home, rallied outside
horses and drifted in inside the sixteenth pole. COMBAT QUEEN , a forward factor two wide on the turn, drifted to the three path in upper stretch, sprinted
clear in mid stretch then weakened. ELEGANT GAL , rated back from between horses soon after the break, pulled her way into a four deep striking position
on the turn then weakened in the drive. MARGIE'S HEAVEN chased the pace, raced three wide on the turn and gave way through the stretch.
HALFINTHEWRAPPER set the pace along the inner rail and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
LA SILUETA settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out leaving the three eighths, circled four wide advancing into the lane, sustained after being
put to left handed asking near mid stretch, reeled in the leader near the sixteenth pole, gained a slim advantage with about fifty yards remaining and
prevailed. DANCING TIL DUSK vied outside a rival under some rating, moved to a short lead through the backstretch run, opened up after being put to a
drive soon into the lane, kept on right handed rousing, dug in when collared and fought gamely to just miss. SMART ENTRY lacked speed while off the
inside, came under pressure four to five wide leaving the half mile marker, circled into the stretch and closed steadily. CELEBRE (IRE) took a short lead into
the first turn then got engaged with DANCING TIL TUSK into the backstretch, disputed the pace to upper stretch then gave way grudgingly. ELLIPSIS broke
a step slow, edged up four wide past the five eighths marker, continued progression while between rivals near mid stretch then flattened out. CATCH THE
SKY rated off the pace, saved ground leaving the three eighths, angled out nearing the lane, was stalled behind foes then angled out late. SISTER SEVILLE
, rank behind the leaders through the opening quarter mile, settled and stayed in range to the three eighths then weakened. GOLD CADILLAC , away
alertly, stalked the dueling leaders three wide, was under pressure past five sixteenths and tired. RUNFASTBABY saved ground and weakened. FULL
FAITH gave early chase three wide and faltered.
