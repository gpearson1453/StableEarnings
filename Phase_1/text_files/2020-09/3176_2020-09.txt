Footnotes
TISDALE set a clear pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. STOLEN LOVE chased the winner from the inside, tipped out near the quarter pole
and finished evenly to be clearly second best. LORD SIMBA lacked early speed while racing in the two path and rallied for the show. SPECIAL INTENTION
broke a step slow, advanced between foes down the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn and was one-paced in the lane. DA WINNER IS failed
to menace while racing two and three wide. POPPY'S TWO STEP was outrun while racing three wide. IWISHIWASPECIAL was rank at the start, chased
the pace four wide and faded after a half.

Footnotes
BETTS settled off the pace outside, raced two wide around the clubhouse turn, advanced three wide around the far turn, reached near even terms
approaching the lane, dueled outside of MO AMERICAN through the stretch and prevailed. MO AMERICAN prompted the pace three wide, took the lead
near the five-sixteenths pole, dueled inside of the winner through the lane and gave way grudgingly. BOWLED OVER set a rated pace in the two path,
fought on inside of the top two to midstretch and held well enough for the show. WON THE BYNG was rank and getting out around the first turn, raced well
back very wide, was bumped leaving the three-quarters pole, continued off the pace well wide around the far turn and had a mild rally down the center of the
track. BOURBON AGOGO had early speed three wide, dropped back a bit around the clubhouse turn, was bumped early on the backstretch, dropped well
back and lacked a further bid. FELIX LEITER raced off the pace inside, too several awkward strides leaving the half-mile pole, lost the rider swerving out
and bumping BOURBON AGOGO into WON THE BYNG and was vanned off.

ALLENDE set a clear pace in the two path, drifted out late under left-handed urging and just lasted. DANCE FOR THE GOLD tracked the winner three wide,
closed steadily through the final furlong and just missed. BOURBON WILDCAT chased the pace inside, continued on the left lead in the lane and finished
evenly. SAND IN MY SHOES hit the starting gate, raced three wide and never threatened. QUALITY TOO SPARE was outrun inside. STREET NONSENSE
had brief speed two wide. SPRING THE TRAPPE was rank at the start and trailed in the three path.

entering the first turn, stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the lane, took the lead near the five-sixteenths marker, was lightly bumped in upper stretch,
battled outside through the lane while being herded out, was brushed late and could not get past. PRETTY GOOD YEAR went evenly while racing three and
