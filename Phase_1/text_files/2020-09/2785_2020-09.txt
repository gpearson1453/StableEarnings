Footnotes
SOUL REFLECTION sped to the front soon after the start, rated along inside to the stretch, and stayed clear under a drive. GRAND UNION broke alertly,
chased outside the winner throughout, and was second best. KING OF ROCK raced three wide around the turn, moved to the rail in upper stretch and ran
on evenly. CHURCHILLS VICTORY moved in from the two-path on the backstretch, and failed to menace through an even effort. WORDMAN received a
bump from SWINGIN ON A STAR at the start, and was no factor two wide. STOPIT lacked the needed response in the two-path. NOBLE NEBRASKAN was
outrun to the stretch, and made no headway on the far outside. SWINGIN ON A STAR broke out bumping WORDMAN, and gave way on the turn three
wide. CAPTURE THE CROWN broke outward, and showed little. WAR OF DECEPTION checked sharply on the rail past the half-mile pole, and dropped far
back. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF WAR OF DECEPTION AGAINST CHURCHILLS VICTORY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE UP THE
BACKSTRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
SEMPER FI bumped with REACTION TIME at the start, ranged up three wide to challenge CHILL HAZE from outside after a half-mile, took over into the
stretch and drew off while moving inside. TRINNI JOHN was close up early, lost considerable position through the turn in the two-path, and got going again
through the stretch to go clear of the rest. CHILL HAZE put in a run along the rail to take over from THE BEAST AND I midway on the turn, was no match for
the winner turning for home, and weakened on his left lead. SCOTCH WHISKEY bumped with REACTION TIME at the start, raced forwardly two wide to the
turn, and faded before reaching the stretch. THE BEAST AND I set the early pace in the two-path, lost the lead to CHILL HAZE after three furlongs, and
tired through the lane. ADEEB walked out of the gate, felt the whip while racing erratically up the backstretch, and remained outrun widest on the turn and
into the stretch. HALO'S DANCE was far back throughout. REACTION TIME was pinballed between SCOTCH WHISKEY and SEMPER FI at the start, and
retired early.

UNCLE ANDREW moved out three wide forwardly placed leaving the first turn, took over outside ST JOE VIPER and BEE MAJOR approaching the
quarter-pole, kicked away through upper stretch, then held off VERDICT IS IN despite shying out considerably from left-hand pressure late. VERDICT IS IN
saved ground unhurried for a half-mile, advanced after six furlongs while swinging out four wide, rallied through the lane and was gaining outside the winner.
KEEPSAKEKITTEN advanced around the far turn two then three wide, had aim outside the winner into the stretch, and was outfinished between the top
two. KID DRAMA was slow into stride, shifted out four or five wide at the top of the stretch, and passed tired horses. ST JOE VIPER set the early pace
inside, was overhauled on the far turn, and gave way. BACANO hugged the rail on the turns, and failed to respond. EARTHQUAKE struck his head on the
right side of the gate at the break, and was through after a half three wide. BEE MAJOR challenged for command between ST JOE VIPER and VERDICT IS
IN leaving the backstretch, and gave way at the head of the lane.

Footnotes
HOPE LADY raced three wide around the turn, stayed on task through the stretch, and overhauled the embattled leaders from outside in the closing strides.
VIVI'S DREAM'S got sandwiched between MISS ITALY and BALL LIGHTNING at the start and was off slow, rocketed past rivals outside heading to the
turn, hooked up outside DANCING IN FIRE battling for the lead from the three-eighths, and fought gamely through a long drive. DANCING IN FIRE broke in
while coming away alertly, cleared to the lead inside, responded when headed from outside by VIVI'S DREAM'S on the turn, dug in along the rail and fought
gamely to the finish. MISS ITALY broke out into VIVI'S DREAM'S, advanced three then four wide approaching the stretch, and gained mildly late on her left
lead. BALL LIGHTNING broke in bumping VIVI'S DREAM'S, was outrun for three-eighths of a mile four then five wide, and made up some ground on the far
outside. PRETTY LIDDIE showed brief speed two wide, and gave way after three furlongs. RUN SILENT was two wide on the turn, moved inside for the
drive and lacked a response on her left lead. WHAT A KNOCKOUT gave way inside on the turn, drifted very wide into the stretch and jogged in.

Footnotes
ZODIAC PRINCESS raced close up inside for nearly six furlongs, shifted out to take a run at OBLIO'S WISH near the top of the stretch, began to prevail
after dueling outside that one to the sixteenth-pole, and was all out to stave off PASSION PLUS to the wire. PASSION PLUS saved ground taking closer
order after six furlongs, switched out three wide for the drive, found her best stride late and just missed outside the winner. OBLIO'S WISH set the pace
inside, responded when hooked by ZODIAC PRINCESS, dueled to deep stretch and yielded on the rail. HOPONTHEBUSGUS raced four wide throughout,
and was no threat with an even finish. DRINKS ON ME was no factor through a three-wide journey. CLASSY OF COURSE raced forwardly two wide to the
far turn, and faded. LADY NINA was in range four wide early, and tired after six furlongs.

Footnotes
PALADIO got bumped between LIV AND LET LIV and LAMPLIGHTER JACK at the start, found a good spot entering the turn with three battling leaders in
view, shifted four wide with a bid into the stretch, came in brushing LAMPLIGHTER JACK and nudging that one inward as they reached the front through the
furlong grounds, continued inward to the 70-yard marker and took a hard-fought decision. LAMPLIGHTER JACK broke inward hitting the left side of the gate
and bumping PALADIO, went up to contest the pace outside EXCHANGE DAY and LIV AND LET LIV leaving the backstretch, got past those two while
being joined from outside by PALADIO in mid stretch, brushed with the latter while being nudged inward, and stayed on stubbornly. DARLA was outsprinted
three wide to the stretch, and was up inside HIDDEN DREAMS for the show while not a threat to the top two. HIDDEN DREAMS was devoid of early speed,
moved to the far outside for the drive and improved past tired horses. EXCHANGE DAY led early inside, was hard-pressed by LIV AND LET LIV and
LAMPLIGHTER JACK around the turn, and tired in the stretch on his left lead. LIV AND LET LIV broke out into PALADIO, got hustled up to vie for command
between horses, and gave way in the stretch without a lead change. MISTER LEONARDO saved ground to no avail. HEART OF GOD broke slowly, and
showed little. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE TRAINER OF LAMPLIGHTER
JACK AGAINST PALADIO, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
ALL AROUND brushed with SOUTH SEA at the start, lagged well behind a hotly contested half-mile, swung five wide into the lane, rallied steadily to reach
the front a sixteenth out and was going away at the finish. FROSTED GRACE was ridden along past the five-sixteenths closing in on the leaders four wide,
stayed on his left lead and ran on willingly inside the winner to go clear of the others. ROYAL SQUEEZE saved ground outrun to the stretch, moved out near
the eighth-pole and was just up for the show. YODEL E. A. WHO broke out brushing SOUTH SEA, was sent up along the rail to engage BELLE
TAPISSERIE, dueled through enervating fractions to the stretch, and weakened inside. BELLE TAPISSERIE broke to the lead, was joined from the inside
by YODEL E. A. WHO after an eighth of a mile, went head and head through a demanding pace to the stretch, and shortened stride on his left lead. SOUTH
SEA was brushed between horses at the start, stayed close two then three wide for a half, and faded through the late stages.

Footnotes
YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY moved up three wide after a half-mile, took over outside ELVIS COLE midway on the far turn, kicked away into the stretch, then
held off SAINT LARNED to the wire. SAINT LARNED bumped with DANVILLE at the start, tucked in behind the leaders for six furlongs, came out two or
three wide past the quarter-pole, rallied through the lane and was inching closer to the winner from outside. SHENDAM (FR) raced three wide around the
turns, and finished evenly outside the top two. DILLON ROCKS came in after the start, was outrun for six furlongs, and improved position through the lane in
the two-path. BUDGET BUSTER trailed early inside, angled to the far outside for the drive and gained ground belatedly. SMELL OF ROSES saved ground
to the stretch, and lacked the needed response. DANVILLE bumped with SAINT LARNED at the start, and failed to make an impact inside. DRILLOMATIC
was always outrun. BYE BYE MAN was never prominent. RED FOG pressed the pace outside ELVIS COLE for a half-mile, and tired. KING TIDE wandered
out at the break, then had to slam on the brakes as rivals came over in front of him, and was far back throughout. ELVIS COLE came in at the start, went up
to set the pace inside, got overhauled by the winner midway on the far turn, and faltered.
