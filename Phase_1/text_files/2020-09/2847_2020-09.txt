EXPRESS was hustled early, had a clear lead on the turn and led mid stretch but failed to hold. DARLING DAAHER stalked the leader and was factor on
the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. AISLE ALTAR HYMN was in range and hustled along on the turn but leveled off
through the stretch. DOLLY STORMY showed no speed and saved ground on the turn but failed to fire.

Footnotes
AUNTIE KATHERINE set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. ROGUE AFFAIR
stalked the leader from the inside, was a factor on the far turn and was clearly second best. HIGH ROLLING DUDE was in range and hustled along on the
far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. DRENA'S BULLET was off slow and had a mild gain on the far turn but needed more.
THE OTHER BREEZE was well back, gained ground on the far turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. PRECIOUS BADGE was in mid pack and
roused on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. TINKER RING was hustled early and raced evenly on the far turn but
from the five path at the top of the stretch flattened out. GIANT MINE was off slow and showed little while outrun. UNO CHAMP had no speed, showed
nothing and from the four path at the top of the stretch had no impact. CAPOEIRA was in touch but chased on the far turn and failed to fire. WILEY
O'RIELLY tracked the early leaders but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.
