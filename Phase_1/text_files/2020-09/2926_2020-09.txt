Footnotes
GLYNN COUNTY came out at the start and raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied in the stretch, lugged in down the lane, drove past
the leaders and cleared the field in the final stages. ROCHAMBEAU tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, edged clear of foes near the
quarter pole, opened up a bit, came in nearing the sixteenth pole and yielded in the final stages. BRIEFCASE BULLY chased the pace early, was in the
three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch and finished willingly in the late stages. SUMMER PALACE was bumped at the start, chased the pace
early, was shuffled back near the half mile pole, came again in the stretch, made a bid from the inside in the stretch, was steadied hard near the sixteenth
pole and weakened late in the drive. CASANOVA KITTEN raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. CAPITAL
CALL was bumped at the start and raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane while making a bid but faded late in the drive. VASARIANO was
through after a half. OL GREY GHOST set the pace for a half then gave way down the lane. BEACHWALKER was through after three quarters. COLONEL
JACKSON was never a factor. EVENINGWITHBERNIE had early speed then folded up. The rider of SUMMER PALACE claimed an objection against the
rider of ROCHAMBEAU for interference near the sixteenth pole and after review by the stewards ROCHAMBEAU was disqualified and placed fourth for the
infraction.
