Footnotes
TIZONA stalked the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, altered outside for the drive, responded when asked and wore down front
running BAPTISM the final furlong. BAPTISM broke sharp from the outside, quickly gained the early margin, remained clear through the turn, continued to
show the way at the eighth pole but could not last. TRUMPI forced the early pace from the inside, advanced through the turn, responded along the rail and
closed with a rush for the show. BETA CAPO SONG chased the early pace from the outside, remained forward but could not keep pace. IMPRESSIVE
STUDENT could only improve position. TOP BRASS went evenly. ALLURING ACTOR forced the early pace and tired. KID CREOLE was no factor.
OVERRULING vied from the outside early and faded.

DICTATOR broke sharp from between foes, quickly gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the
second turn, widen the effort through the drive and was never threatened while in hand always. GRAND MARAIS stalked the early pace from the inside,
advanced through the second turn, responded when asked and was up for the place while no threat to the winner. PERFECT PARADE forced the early
pace inside, remained forward entering the drive but could not keep pace while holding position. TWO DATE pressed the early pace from the outside, made
a bid entering the drive but was too late. DERECHO WARRIOR forced the early pace inside but came up empty in the drive. BAD BOY JOHNNY was no
factor. PEPPERMINT CRUNCH chased the early pace and faded. HE'S AN HONEST MAN was no threat. CRIDER CASH was wide throughout, pulled up
entering the second turn and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CHARMING BULLET stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn,
responded entering the drive and was along in time. TROPHY DADDY dueled from the inside early, battled up the backstretch, fought through the second
turn, remained forward but could not match strides. ZYZACK chased the early pace outside, made a bid entering the drive and rallied late for the show.
GEMINATOR forced the early pace outside but could not keep pace. FAVORITE SON could only improve position. ZENMAN dueled from the outside and
tired. LIGHTNING LEE was no factor. DRAX was off a step slow and no menace. IRISH MISSILE had a steady fade. WICKED STATEMENT was no
menace. INCREDIBULL DEAL was never close, lost contact and was eased after three quarters and walked off.
