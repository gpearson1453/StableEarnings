Footnotes
RB GAIM CHANGER moved up under urging, made a rail bid with a half-mile to run, shook clear along the rail on the turn, responded well in the stretch and
held under strong urging. DREAM PEARL chased the pace on the outside, pursued the winner doggedly in the stretch and finished willingly for the place.
BIG BEN AA was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. UPTOWN WTF raced towards
the front, dropped back near the half-mile pole, went three wide on the turn and came up empty. FLEET DE SAND was well placed just off the pace,
dropped from three wide to near the rail on the turn and capitulated. TTT BROTHER WHIZ broke in at the start, disputed the pace, dropped back in the two
path on the turn and tired. Z YOYO GO pressed the pace on the outside, dropped back near the half-mile pole and retreated. ROYAL JOLIE broke a step
slow then was taken up some and was no factor. MY CHARADE raced well back in the field and showed little. DOC HOLIDDAY saved ground towards the
rear, came off the rail late on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and was outrun.
