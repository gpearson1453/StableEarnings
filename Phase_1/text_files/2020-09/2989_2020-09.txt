Footnotes
SAPONARA quickly led in the two path, moved clear into the far turn and maintained his advantage driving. I AM THE CASH MAN chased close up, moved
inside on the turn and was just up for the place. IRON LAD urged inside the winner early, eased to the outside on the turn,loomed a threat but flattened out
in the final furlong. CASTLE AMBASSADOR broke very slowly, advanced four wide on the turn then faded. MAC AND BREEZE raced between rivals then
began fading on the turn. IMMINENT DANGER dropped well behind inside and was always outrun. SMART TEE broke a step slowly then trailed throughout.

lacked speed, moved wide on the turn and rallied too late. ASK CHUCK chased outside early, moved inside on the turn and faded. FREE FOR NOTHING

Footnotes
BRYCE'S PHILLY saved ground just off the pace, drifted out near stretch and was just up. YOURS COMPLETELY alternated for the lead inside, was clear
deep stretch but then just failed. LADY VALENTINA, between top flight, fought gamely to deep stretch then weakened slightly. NANCY B saved ground to
stretch, drifted out and rallied too late. ZENSATIONAL DIXIE, outrun early, raced extremely wide on the turn and through stretch and passed faders.
YELLOW CHICK, just off the rail, split rivals on the turn and didn't threaten. DESERTED, very wide, was not a factor. VALIANT SPIRIT, wide and just off the
pace, tired. PANTALONI showed little. POINT LOCKOUT broke slowly and never challenged. SUE'S MONSTER BABY saved ground and gave way. IT'S A
SHAW THING dueled for command three wide then stopped.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MIRACLE forced the pace outside, led at the quarter pole, edged clear and lasted while kept to a drive. DOUBLE THE BET raced wide off the
leaders, split foes in the stretch and closed well. NOT LEAVING prompted the pace three wide, remained wide and flattened out. RUMOR RIDGE broke a
step slowly, moved up inside, offered a brief bid into the stretch but was outfinished. AUSSIE MIST set a pressured pace inside then weakened through the
stretch. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR broke very slowly and trailed to the stretch while no factor. HER DIVINENESS chased just off the pace five wide and gave
way on the turn.

RIDE ON FAITH set a pressured pace inside, repelled repeated challenges and edged away driving. FLAT RATE prompted the winner to the stretch and
continued gamely to hold the place. CATCH FIRE saved ground close up under rating, slipped through into the lane but flattened out. TOMMY'S TOP CAT
forced the pace three wide to mid-stretch and weakened. CAPE MAY STYLE crowded at the start, dropped back inside and gained late. DREAMY MARTINI
crowded at the start, dropped well behind and was no factor. THREATLOVESMIDNITE ducked in at the start causing crowding, chased wide and tired.
BROTHER TEZ settled behind a wall of pacesetters and proved empty when asked. MANTLE lacked speed and was never in contention. JONES TAXI was
crowded at the start then trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MARRIEDINSHANGHAI dueled between foes, shook loose leaving the turn and drew away under mild handling in an impressive debut. DOCTOR DOOM
came in and bumped with MONEY KID leaving the gate, raced wide on the turn, drifted wider through stretch and gained place. PRINCIPINO raced inside,
took up on the far turn, continued along the rail and gained show. CELTIC HEART, in the four path while never far back, tired. MONEY KID was very
fractious in the gate, came out leaving the gate contributing to the bumping with DOCTOR DOOM, lost action, was very wide on the turn and through
stretch. MISCHIEVOUS JUAN, racing outside his stablemate, failed to menace. GARBAN, between foes, was never a factor. CALL ME G Q saved ground
dueling, drifted in and out through stretch and gave way. NEW HAMPSHIRE, three wide early and just off the early pace, eased back and moved inside,
drifted out and stopped.

POWERFUL VENEZUELA stalked the pacesetters outside, bid into the stretch then wore down the leader in the final furlong. MANOLITO vied outside,
moved clear midway on the turn, was collared late but battled gamely to the finish. THOUSAND PERCENT settled close up off the inside and flattened out
through the stretch. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY pursued the leaders three wide, moved five wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. INFORMATIVE saved
ground, slipped through into the stretch with only a mild rally. HITMEWTHURBESTSHOT forced the pace along the rail to the turn then gave way. RISQUE
