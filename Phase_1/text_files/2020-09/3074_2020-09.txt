GOIN' GOOD set a pressured pace from the inside, made a bid to shake clear on the turn, then drew out past the eighth pole and was kept to mild pressure
to prove much the best. WAIT FOR NAIROBI was well placed early on the inside, angled out for racing room entering the stretch but proved to be no match
for the winner while clearly second best. WILD TAPIT was allowed to settle early, advanced on the turn, was blocked and awaited room by the quarter pole,
swung out five wide for the drive but flattened out late while besting the rest. AMERICAN VIOLET was allowed to settle early and was four wide past the
quarter pole, angled in the stretch to pass the tiring rivals. RED BEE was off about four lengths last, then came into the stretch while four wide, angled out in
deep stretch to have a belated rally. MISS MAGDALENA chased the early pace four wide, then came into the drive seven wide but was empty. SHAKE IT

CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK was well placed early from the inside, then eased out past the quarter pole to come into the stretch four to five wide, then closed
well to get up in time under a drive. CAP DE FUEGO set the early pace and shook clear past the eighth pole, but was nailed at the wire to just miss. CASH
FOR GOLD stalked the early pace and made a three wi8de bid past the quarter pole, stayed on but needed more. TWOBIRDSONESTONE raced four wide
early and seemed disinterested, was roused past the five sixteenths pole then came seven wide into the stretch to offer a belated rally. FLATOUTJUSTICE
was allowed to settle early and raced four wide past the quarter pole, but offered no rally. WICKED SLIDER chased the early pace, made a mild bid three

Footnotes
STYLISH KITTEN was reserved early, made a six wide move past the quarter pole, drew clear in the stretch to prove much the best under a drive.
SEQUAYA was allowed to settle early, raced towards the inside on the backstretch, then was roused by the five sixteenths pole to launch a five wide bid
past the quarter pole, but could no go with the winner in the final furlong while saving the place. MAGNA G FORCE was three wide into the first turn, stalked
the pace from in between rivals but lacked the needed winning bid. PERSONALLY was reserved early on the inside, then came into the stretch seven wide
to offer a late rally. MORE COWBELL stalked the pace from the inside, then was blocked in upper stretch and by the eighth pole, then when found room late
had no punch. MY WYNTER ECHO had a three to four wide trip to around the eighth pole, then angled out but offered no significant rally. NARIZ CANELA
set the pace towards the inside then gave way final furlong. HIGH VISION was four wide into the first turn, failed to menace. WALLAWALLABINGBANG was
four wide i9nto the first turn, stalked the pace three wide then weakened. GIGABYTE was not a threat.

Footnotes
SHOTGUN JOE dueled for the lead on the inside, then prevailed to prove best after a long stretch drive. MANUELITO dueled outside the winner throughout
but was outfinished late in a game effort. PUNKSTER tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the far turn but flattened out while saving the
show award. BENNY'S LEGACY made a four wide middle move on the far turn but flattened out. VOLACIOUS lacked a rally while on the inside.
AFLEETING IDEA raced towards the inside on the turn, angled out towards the top of the stretch while failing to threaten. INDY REBEL chased the early
pace five wide then tired. LEOTA STINGER was not a factor.
