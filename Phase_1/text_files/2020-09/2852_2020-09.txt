Footnotes
MY MOONSHINE lacked speed, circled the far turn five deep, lugged in under right hand urging when taking the lead near the eighth pole and lasted under
encouragement. ABDAA , angled in approaching the first turn, raced slightly off the rail down the backstretch, worked between horses in the stretch and
rallied. AIR LIFT , briefly steadied in traffic while in the four path leaving the far turn, rallied outside horses. SURVEY (IRE) showed speed along the rail,
disputed the pace to mid stretch then faded. GALACTIC SLAM failed to be a menace and passed tired rivals. DIVINE PROPORTION was not a factor.
SOUPER COHIBA , three wide the first turn, advanced four deep on the far turn and gave way in the stretch. LIFESPAN stalked the pace, moved up in the
three path on the far turn and gave way through the stretch. THEDA'S BOY broke slowly and was outrun. LUNAR CYCLE raced in mid pace to the stretch
then gave way. MATSUDA , four wide the first turn, bid for the lead two wide on the far turn then faltered. NITE TRIPPER disputed the pace outside
SURVEY down the backstretch, faltered on the far turn and was eased.

Footnotes
PASSAGE OF LINES , bumped at the break, edged up three wide in the early going and took a tracking spot, came under pressure past the five sixteenths,
bid to engage the leader into the lane, dueled outside before securing command in mid stretch, kept on under solid handling and drew clear. WICKED
PRANKSTER had speed outside NATTY BEAU, went clear heading towards the half mile marker, dropped in to set the pace, dug in when collared entering
the lane, battled past the furlong grounds, gave way grudgingly in the final fifty yards and saved the place. KING ALAN stumbled badly at the break,
regrouped and settled, advanced in about the three path past the three eighths, was under pressure pursuing into the lane, worked between rivals in mid
stretch and churned on with interest. MANKLIN CREEK eased out early and settled within range, took closer order three wide mid turn, chased into the lane
but lacked the needed finish. NATTY BEAU had speed inside, rated back off the leader nearing the turn, came under a ride past the five sixteenths and
failed to generate a solid kick. ARTILLERY dropped back around the turn. SWEENEY'S CAT bumped with the winner leaving the gate and was outrun.

Footnotes
FED UP FIRED UP saved ground stalking the pace, eased out approaching the eighth pole, led inside the sixteenth pole and drew off. FIONNBHARR

I'MTHEKATSMEOW flashed speed then eased back off the leaders and settled three wide, angled five wide advancing into the lane, closed under left
handed encouragement and emerged with GALLINELLA inside the furlong grounds, gained a slim lead near the sixteenth pole and held firm under a drive.
GALLINELLA saved ground off a contested early pace, angled four wide making a run into the stretch, rallied between runners to vie for command past the
eighth pole, battled gamely to the inside of the winner but wasn't quite good enough. PROUD MANDATE , off the pace three wide, angled five to six wide for
the drive and had a steady run. GO AMANDA lacked speed, was under a ride three wide mid turn, angled out but lacked a solid run. TWEET AWAY ROBIN
had speed three wide, battled outside rivals around the turn, failed to keep pace leaving the eighth pole and faded. STAY OUT dropped in nearing the half
mile pole and took measure of the leaders, slipped through to challenge around the turn, spurted clear entering the lane, could not resist the top pair
heading towards the sixteenth pole and weakened. MAGICAL LUNA had speed two wide to contest the early pace, battled between runners from the three
eighths marker to the quarter pole then weakened near mid stretch. JUMPING MICHELLE , off slowly, was outrun.

Footnotes
COMPLETED PASS had speed outside rivals, dropped in nearing the turn and rated off the duel, edged up when keen past the three eighths, clipped heels
nearing the turn, regrouped and found a seam past the three sixteenths, forged clear with a furlong remaining, kept on under right handed rousing and held
firm. SO STREET settled off the pace and raced in the clear mid turn, swung five to six wide entering the lane, drifted in advancing past the three sixteenths,
was corrected with left handed stick work and finished gamely. LOVE YOU MUCH , away well, rated in range of the contested pace, took closer order
behind the winner nearing the five sixteenths, steadied off that rival soon after, moved up past mid stretch, angled in and finished well while just missing the
place. LEMON ZIP , unhurried early while saving ground, eased out nearing mid stretch, split rivals near the sixteenth pole and finished well. JOSEPH
lacked speed, circled five wide into the lane, angled further out but lacked a solid kick. WET YOUR WHISTLE , sluggish from the gate, raced well back
leaving the far turn, swung well wide but failed to rally. MISSIN THE BIG DOG stalked off the rail, angled four to five wide advancing towards the lane, failed
to kick on nearing the furlong grounds and faded. SINGANOTHERSONG dueled inside on a short early lead, attempted to lug out while battling into the
lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. OLDIES BUT GOODIES dueled outside a rival, moved to a short lead past the three eighths, had his heels
clipped entering the lane, fought on to mid stretch then steadily gave way. TEMPT ME TWICE stalked three to four wide, briefly threatened between runners
entering the lane, failed to go on past the three sixteenths and retreated. There was a stewards' inquiry into the run into the lane and an objection by the
rider of LOVE YOU MUCH against the winner for alleged interference entering the stretch. No action was deemed necessary

Footnotes
HAPPY SAVER chased the pace two wide around both turns,was under urging approaching the stretch, challenged for the lead in upper stretch, dueled to
the eighth pole and edged clear. MONDAY MORNING QB , clear entering the first turn, set the pace near the rail, was challenged by the winner in upper
stretch, remained on his left lead until inside the eighth pole and fought gamely to the wire. BIG CITY BOB lacked speed, raced in the three path between
horses on the far turn and failed to be a menace. MEXICAN WONDER BOY stalked the pace, raced in the two path on the far turn and gave way. AMEN
CORNER hugged the inner rail, stalked the pace to the three furlongs pole then faltered. LETMENO stumbled leaving the starting gate, was always outrun
and circled the far turn four deep.

Footnotes
DOCTOR MOUNTY broke alertly and took command inside rivals heading towards the first turn, was nicely rated towards the inside, spurted away without
much asking past the three eighths, responded when shaken up soon into the lane, wandered outward when widening near mid stretch, was corrected with
right handed encouragement and held firm. NINETY ONE ASSAULT rated kindly three wide while staking the pace, was ask to pick up the pace while three
deep past the five sixteenths, came four wide into the lane, kept on grinding through the final furlong and earned the place. SERVE THE KING (GB) broke a
step slow, lagged well off the early pace while removed from the inside, was put to a strong ride leaving the far turn, angled out soon into the lane, leveled
off to his best stride in the final seventy yards and gained. O DIONYSUS rated in the clear, edged up and got through along the rail entering the lane,
progressed past mid stretch and continued with interest to the line. TALK OR LISTEN (IRE) fought restraint past the wire the first time while saving ground,
settled around the first, stalked while remained along towards the fence, eased out under pressure and pursued into the lane, chased between rivals inside
the furlong grounds but was out finished. TAXABLE GOODS prompted the pace outside the winner, was under a ride chasing past the five sixteenths,
drifted out a path when between foes nearing the lane and gave way. GUNNISON drafted back off the pace and failed to respond.

GRAND CRU CLASSE assumed the early lead, set the pace along the rail under confident handling, was set down the for the drive and dug in tenaciously
to prevail. MARKET RUMOR , four wide the first turn, stalked the pace, was four deep leaving the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide and rallied
strongly outside the winner. PERFECT ALIBI saved ground. stalked the pace and finished gamely inside horses. ANKLE MONITOR lacked speed, raced
along the inner rail most of the trip, remained inside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. LASTING UNION , in the two path between horses down
the backstretch, failed to keep pace on the far turn then lacked the needed rally. PRINCESS CADEY lacked speed, moved up on the far turn, angled to the
five path in upper stretch then gave way. BREVIARY , no factor, was four wide on the far turn. MALIBEAUTY , three wide the first turn, prompted the pace

Footnotes
CITY BADGER broke a step slow, quickly recovered and edged up while saving ground, sat patiently heading to mid turn, eased out and moved up behind
rivals leaving the three sixteenths, shifted back in, kept on doggedly under pressure and forged ahead in the final yards. HEART HERO had speed to the
inside of rivals, dueled around the turn, drifted out a bit and battled on a short lead past the furlong grounds, kept on gamely but just could not turn away the
winner's charge. HAIR OF THE DOG dueled outside HEART HERO, raced between foes into the lane, kept up the fight to deep stretch then gave way
grudigngly. NEXTSTOP POKIPC was pinched back after breaking a bit slowly, pulled his way forward into the turn, raced three wide into the lane, angled
out and closed belatedly. BALTIMORE BUD tracked the dueling leaders, bid three deep while four wide into the lane, vied to mid stretch and faded. LITTLE
BAY bore out at the break bothering NEXTSTOP POKIPC, corrected and saved ground leaving the far turn, eased out for the drive but lacked a bid.
JUNIOR JUMPER , in the clear chasing the duel mid turn, angled out and gave way. DEGAS , wide, was carried well out in the course entering the stretch,
corrected but failed to overcome. COMPASS COURSE dropped off the early pace, saved ground through the lane but failed to menace. BEYOND THE
STARS , four to five wide, was not a factor. BOB'S GLORY had speed, chased the leaders around the turn while saving ground, bore out bothering rivals
entering the stretch and weakened. KUKULKAN chased off the inside, was bothered near the five sixteenths and faltered.
