DANCE FOR A DIME rated a slim early lead inside then came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far
turn, drifted a bit outward in later yards but lasted well under steady handling. SING FROSTY settled off the pace toward the inside then started a bid toward
the three eighths pole, angled to the four path on the far turn, dueled close most of the stretch but lugged inward and steadied through later yards. WHOSE
THAT LADY raced off the pace about the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was blocked off the heels of Sing Frosty toward the eighth pole,
though, came back to finish evenly. SUZIE Q SONDE rated close inside the first turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about
the six path and finished evenly. BELLA FEMMINA stalked the pace then challenged toward the three eighths pole, contested the turn two deep while at a
close disadvantage then weakened approaching the sixteenth pole. ADORABLEDEPLORABLE stalked the earlier pace from the three path then weakened
past the three eighths pole. LADY SPARROW drifted into the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
VINTAGE GIN rated a slim lead inside responded to the challenge of the runner-up leaving the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage
nearest the rail on the far turn but recovered the lead past the eighth pole and held that one off under a vigorous hand ride through the stretch. RAELYN'S
STAR stalked the pace two deep then challenged from the three eighths pole, contested with the edge on the far turn, was caught leaving the eighth pole
but dug in gamely to the finish. HATTITUDE rated close toward the inside then picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off
the rail, though, flattened in the lane. CHARITABLE ROSE raced in the six path the opening turn and left the turn outside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and finished evenly inside. COUNTRY MAGIC saved ground off the early pace then picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, and weakened. GORGEOUS ROAD settled off the pace in the three and four paths, bid toward the
five sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn, entered the lane outside and passed some rivals. SEEKING SERA raced in the four path the first
turn and picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, then faded on the far turn. ROCKET BUSTER settled off the earlier pace about the three path,
picked up the chase approaching the five sixteenths pole then faded on the far turn.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF ANYTHING pressured the pace three wide and took the nod inside the five sixteenths pole, then dug in under steady encouragement to hold
on. MOJO MATTERS pressed the pace inside and raced off the rail on the turn, left the turn in the four path, dug in to take second later yards and finished
well at the outside poll of the winner. DEVELIN' ROSE set a pressured pace but was caught leaving the five sixteenths pole, remained close in the upper
stretch then flattened the final sixteenth. CHARITABLE MISS gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn at the rail and finished evenly. QUITE
SUGGESTIVE chased the pace off the rail, drifted to the five path nearing the head of the lane, and flattened stride. SHARP'S MISSION gave chase and
rounded the turn about the five path, then showed little more. ACROSS AMERICA chased the early pace toward the outside then moved inward nearing the
quarter pole, raced at the rail on the turn and weakened. HOPE FOR THEMONEY came away a step slow but picked up the chase inside, steadied off the
heels of Across America approaching the quarter pole and showed little more. SMARTY PLEASE gave chased outside and raced wide on the turn. ANI
WINEHOUSE was through early.

JOOPSTER rated the pace inside, came under pressure into the turn and was steadily encouraged to hold on. UNION GRACE gave chase through the
backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and was gaining slowly late. LATE CALLER angled toward mid track to chase the early pace then saved ground on
the turn and finished evenly. SHACKLED steadied from between horses in the vicinity of the three eighths pole, raced three wide on the turn and finished
evenly. ICE KAUFY chased the early pace toward mid track, raced four wide on the turn and finished evenly. WIZARD OF ODDS gave chase inside then
weakened leaving the turn. GABBI'S AMOR was outrun and rounded the turn about the four path. GOOD GENES broke awkwardly then picked up the

Footnotes
MALIBU SPLASH was slow into stride then picked up the chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn, took the lead in the upper stretch and held on well with
steady encouragement. LETTS GO TO DIXIES gave chase off the rail and rounded the turn in the two and three paths then finished well; second best.
UNDENIABLE TOUCH gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the five path and finished evenly. GANDHI'S CASTLE chased the pace and
rounded the turn in the six and seven paths, then improved position in an even finish. MARTHA'S BANNER gave chase outside, raced in the five path of the
turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. GOOD KARMA gave chase through the backstretch then checked approaching the quarter pole and gave
way. EVAN'S CHILE set a pressured pace and raced clear at the rail on the turn, but, was taken up leaving the eighth pole and vanned off lame. This race
was hand timed.

Footnotes
BARKER LANE stalked the early pace from the two and three paths and challenged leaving the five sixteenths pole, took the lead past the quarter pole and
contested the edge two deep on the far turn, then dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. UNCUT settled off the pace in the two and three paths,
bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, dug in to take second inside the sixteenth pole and was gaining on the
winner. PIMM AND PROPER rated close inside the opening turn then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the
four path then dueled through the stretch for third. WAKES UP HAPPY raced just off the pace in the three path the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the five path, but, drifted toward the head of the lane and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third.
THUNDERTURTLE entered the first turn in the six path and raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through
the far turn in the three path and showed little more. CANARSIE PRINCESS rated the pace inside then came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, was caught past the quarter, rounded the far turn at the rail and weakened. HARMONIC THUNDER saved ground off the pace and showed little
response past the three eighths pole. POSTINO'S QUEST was not a factor and BYEGONE DAYS was also not a factor. NUVE NEGRA showed little
response through the backstretch.
