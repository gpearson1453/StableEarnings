ODDS ON stalked the pace, moved up five wide just past the eighth pole, finished well and got up late under strong encouragement. PHANTOM RO
pressed the early pace, gained command through the far turn, raced three wide in the stretch, led late and just missed in a game effort. BURFORD settled
off the early pace, raced along the inside around the turn into the lane, angled five wide through the stretch and made a late gain. I GOT A ROCK stalked
the pace and had not enough in the drive. HIGHER PURPOSE set all the pace from the outside and tired while racing three wide. MORE ABUNDANCE was
unhurried early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. JAMMER was bumped at the break, raced far back early and trailed
throughout.

LIMITED VIEW showed good early speed to set all the pace, raced in the four path through the stretch and held gamely to be clear under all out pressure.
GIFTED HEART stalked the pace while racing along the inside down the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn through the stretch and
finished second best. DEEP RED stalked the pace, raced four wide nearing the eighth pole and had no final winning bid. MY QUEEN MICHELLE raced in
tight quarters soon after the break, raced three wide in the lane and had no late response. PHANTOM SHOT settled off the early pace, saved ground and
never was a factor. ALWAYS SOMETHING pressed the pace from the outside, raced four wide into the upper stretch and tired.

MUHLENBERG tracked the leader while racing two wide, gained command through the far turn and was well clear late under a steady hand ride. STORM
TOWER stalked the early pace, awaited room into the lane, angled three wide in the upper stretch to move up but was no match for the winner. GLACIER
PARK was slow early, raced along the inside down the backstretch, moved up four wide at the quarter pole and had not enough in the drive. FELLOW set
all the pace and gave way along the inside. DITEN raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

Footnotes
CAREY TIMES tracked the leader down the backstretch while racing two deep, took command into the upper stretch and finished well to be clear under
strong pressure. ABSOLVED stalked the early pace, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and finished second best. ABUELO PAPS was allowed to settle
early, raced five wide in the lane and made a good late gain. TOMMY SHELBY was slow early, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and had not
enough. CRUSH IT dropped back early, raced three wide in the stretch and had no late response. JEBOLOGIST stalked early, saved ground and never was
a factor. NAUTICAL NATURE set all the pace along the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
RAN CHAR pressed the early pace, gained command around the far turn, raced three wide in the stretch and held gamely under strong handling. BEAN
INDISCREET settled off the early pace, moved up four wide through the stretch and slowly closed in on the winner. LADY FOX was unhurried early, moved
up along the inside around the far turn into the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. CARROT CAKE settled off the early pace, moved up five wide at the
eighth pole and had not enough. ALL ABOUT AUDREY stalked the early pace, raced seven wide in the lane and had no late response. SUZZETTE STAR
stalked the pace along the inside, raced three wide nearing the eighth pole and weakened late. DIXIE'S FASCINATOR dropped back early, raced four wide
into the upper stretch and had no rally. TEA IN CHINA showed good speed and gave way while racing along the inside. PAVLA'S MISSION failed to sustain
a bid, gave way and was eased. DIAL EMMA REILLY raced far back and never was involved, gave way and was eased.
