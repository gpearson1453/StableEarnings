DAAHERS BULLY seized command early, edged clear leaving the turn and was all out to hold LOVIN' THE RUSH safe. The latter saved ground, moved
closer on the turn, finished willingly along the inside rail and just missed. WONDERFUL DANCER pinched at the start, was settled while three wide,
advanced on the turn and stayed on in the stretch. CALLME MR MISTER was void of speed and passed tired ones. LARCH chased while five wide and
lacked a rally. C J OMEGA raced forwardly while four wide and faded. TORINGTON was always outrun. KRIS ME DEADLY stalked the pace and
weakened.
