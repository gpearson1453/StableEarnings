SHWEET PERSUASION settled well, advanced on the far turn, responded to his cue and rallied while three wide stretch. ITSALLABOUTYOU reserved
early, commenced his bid on the far turn, was swung five wide in the stretch and offered a steady bid. CAESARTHERULER sprinted clear, set a demanding
pace and was worn down in the stretch. IOWA NATIVE stalked the quick pace and weakened. MATCHLOCK was bumped at the start and failed to threaten.
YORK ROAD showed little. WOKE UP IN LOVE leaned out at the start, saved ground and faded.

the turn and stayed on well. KELLEN CASH saved ground, posed no threat to the principles and kept on for a minor share. FOURDANGSHORE chased the
pacesetter and failed to menace. TEQUILA was always outrun. NOT THIS AGAIN showed little. FLAT OUT FREED was void of speed. HE'S A BIG DILL
swerved in badly at the start. STRIKINGGOLDNUGGET prompted the pace and faltered.
