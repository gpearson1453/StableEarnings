Footnotes
FITZ'S MO pressed the pace outside LITTLE DUDE and DREAMING THOUSAND, was under a drive from midway on the turn, and was up in the final
strides. LITTLE DUDE set a pressured pace inside rivals, settled into the lane well off the rail, and fought gamely to the finish. DREAMING THOUSAND
pressed the pace outside LITTLE DUDE from the start, bid through the stretch and was outfinished between the top two. PARTY OF NO followed behind the
first flight to the stretch, and lacked a solid bid on the rail. MINDSHIP Q raced two wide on the turn, and made no impact. OSPREY was tough to load, got
pushed out by EXIT RIGHT into NINJA and was bumped solidly between those two, and was never close. NINJA received a solid bump from OSPREY at
the start, pressed the pace outside rivals, and faded in the stretch. DEVILISH TAIL was outrun inside. GEGE CONQUEST broke awkwardly, and was
outrun. EXIT RIGHT broke out into OSPREY, then was bumped hard by the latter and steadied back a stride later, moved in from the five-path early on the
turn, and remained at the rear.

Footnotes
MY POINT EXACTLY saved ground up close early, moved out three wide to take over outside SON OF OAHU and TOTONO midway on the far turn, and
drew away from the latter through the last eighth of a mile. TOTONO prompted the pace outside SON OF OAHU, challenged for command between horses
after six furlongs, and was outdueled inside the winner through the lane. BOW TIE AFFAIR was outrun for six furlongs, came three wide off the final bend
and offered a mild response to go clear of the rest. LUCKY FAST was outrun early inside, had the two-path on the far turn, and could not reach contention.
SON OF OAHU showed the way inside through an even pace, got collared by the top two finishers on the far turn, moved out approaching the stretch and
gave way. SHIDOSHI was through after six furlongs, and jogged in.

Footnotes
CARISMATICA was bumped around between GOODBYE GABY and UNDERCOVER OUTLAW at the start, followed inside the leaders for a half-mile, was
put to a drive soon after that to lodge a bid along the rail, got through inside GOODBYE GABY, and edged away from that one after a long drive. GOODBYE
GABY bumped twice with CARISMATICA at the start, set the pace in the two-path, faced challenges from both sides turning for home, and yielded outside
the winner late. RASPBERRY BALLET broke slowly, advanced four wide on the turn, had aim outside the leaders through the furlong grounds, and flattened
out. NOMBRE saved ground and failed to factor. RIVETING SPIRIT pressed the pace outside, and drifted wide tiring steadily after a half.
VENEZUELANCHAMPION became edgy in the gate prior to the start dislodging the rider, hit the left side of the gate and came out slow, and was through
early. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW broke out brushing with CARISMATICA at the start, and dropped far back in the stretch.

Footnotes
NICHIREN advanced four wide on the turn, took over outside AWESOME BEACH at the top of the stretch going comfortably, got roused through upper
stretch and drew away under pressure. PAPA HONOR was outrun early, moved out past the eighth-pole, and finished with good energy outside rivals.
FREELANCE became edgy in the gate prior to the start, grabbed the lead with an alert break, was overhauled by AWESOME BEACH entering the turn, and
ran on evenly in the two-path. AWESOME BEACH bumped with KING TARZAN at the start, took over outside FREELANCE and cleared for the lead
entering the turn, could not handle NICHIREN past the quarter-pole, and weakened. JUMP BACK JACK bumped with SIDARTH after the start, and was no
threat through an even effort. SIDARTH bumped with JUMP BACK JACK after the start, and posed no threat. TRUE IDENTITY hit the left side of the gate at
the start, showed brief speed inside, and tired. KING TARZAN was skittish prior to being loaded, brushed the left side of the gate and bumped with
AWESOME BEACH at the start, and tired after three furlongs four wide. ARRENDAJO was far back throughout. GRAB THE CHANCE broke slowly and was
always far back.

CHASE RUNNER advanced four wide on the turn, took over outside SO LONG CHUCK coming to the quarter-pole, outdueled that one through upper
stretch, and edged away in the late stages. SO LONG CHUCK came through inside to get the lead from FOCUS ON ME after a half-mile, lost the advantage
to CHASE RUNNER shortly after that, battled back on the rail turning for home, and came up second best. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA raced close up three
wide for a half, and faded in the stretch. LOVE NEST was in tight on the rail and steadied inside SO LONG CHUCK approaching the five-furlong marker,
and lacked a solid response. FOCUS ON ME sped clear early in the two-path, was collared after a half, and faltered.

Footnotes
BRIDOLOGIST broke out bumping SEATBELT, chased outside AWESOME ENOUGH for three furlongs, challenged for command between that one and
SEATBELT at the top of the stretch, and edged away from the latter under a drive. SEATBELT bumped with BRIDOLOGIST at the start, chased three wide
and was under a drive before reaching the stretch, loomed outside the leaders past the three-sixteenths, and was outkicked by the top one. AWESOME
ENOUGH bobbled at the start but was away alertly and sped clear, yielded to the top two coming to mid stretch, and faded staying on his left lead.
GLENN'S CAPER was outsprinted early despite hustling tactics, moved to the far outside for the drive and passed tired horses. HELLFIRE BOB broke out,
advanced mildly four wide on the turn, and weakened in the stretch. FELON lost his footing at the start, and was outrun three wide. LOGSDON faded
steadily inside. LITTLE TEQUILA was finished early two wide.

Footnotes
WITCH HUNTER was never far back, advanced four wide on the turn, poked a head in front of UNION LANE after six furlongs, moved clear through upper
stretch, and held on while drifting out. LA TRES JOLIE was outrun for a half-mile, swung four wide beginning to hit her best stride turning for home, moved
inside the winner a sixteenth out, and was whittling away the margin. GRAN ETIQUETA was forced out by TALE OF V K at the start, moved up through the
middle stages three wide, and flattened out in mid stretch on her left lead. JANET B DOESIT ALL was outrun early, took closer order after six furlongs out in
the four-path, and improved on the far outside for a share. TALE OF V K broke out impeding GRAN ETIQUETA, tracked outside the leaders, and weakened
after six furlongs. ITS ABOUT ME bumped with CHIQUI THE GRAY at the start, and was outrun inside. UNION LANE set a pressured pace inside, was
headed by the winner at the quarter-pole, and gave way. WEST HORIZEN was finished after a half-mile. CHIQUI THE GRAY bumped with ITS ABOUT ME
at the start, pressed the pace outside UNION LANE, and weakened on the turn.

Footnotes
GIBBERISH prompted LIL MISS HOTSHOT from outside, took over nearing the three-eighths, was roused to shake off SAMMIE SUNSHINE into the
stretch, and drove well clear. SAMMIE SUNSHINE advanced between horses approaching the half-mile pole, lodged a bid outside GIBBERISH late on the
turn, got shaken off into the lane, jumped back to her left lead a sixteenth out and held the place. HEIRESSINDY saved ground in range to the stretch, and
lacked the needed final response. ADDILYN moved up along the inside after six furlongs, but flattened out and finished evenly. INDICIA was no factor two
wide. GREATER PLAN was finished early three wide. LIL MISS HOTSHOT set the early pace inside, lost the lead to GIBBERISH after five furlongs, and
retreated.

Footnotes
REAGAN'S HEART stayed close early outside, bid in the four-path turning for home, overhauled SLICK STAR and FRANCO'S TEAM with a furlong
remaining and drove clear. SLICK STAR sped clear early inside, dug in as FRANCO'S TEAM challenged approaching the quarter-pole, battled back inside
that rival through upper stretch, but could not contain the top one. FRANCO'S TEAM chased outside SLICK STAR from the start, loomed menacingly after
three-eighths of a mile, but could not sustain the bid and weakened past the furlong marker. YOUNG RAYMOND saved ground entering the turn, angled to
the far outside past the quarter-pole, and lacked the needed response on his left lead. ANOTHER SOFTBALL had the four-path around the turn, and tired
before reaching the stretch. MR. CESCO broke behind field, and was never close. WAHOOWAH broke a step slow and steadied at the start, and was
always outrun. DON FAGER was finished early.
