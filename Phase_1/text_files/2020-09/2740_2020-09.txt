resistance late. HERO'S MAN was caught four wide in the run through the first turn to the half mild pole, continued to press on the far turn into upper stretch
finally wearing down the while angling out the final sixteenth. TRY TRY AGAIN stalked the early pace then gave way on the far turn. DADDY'S ON STRIKE

Footnotes
SOUTHERN RULES slow early angled four wide in upper stretch finding a late burst to clear in the final yards. BIG GAME BOB pressed the pace dueling
through the turn, edged clear in upper stretch digging in from the three path being run down in the closing yards. BERN CIGARS pressed the pace dueling
all out through the turn, ceded in upper stretch weakening late finishing evenly. ASTUTE WARRIOR raced mid pack moving evenly down the lane to
improve a bit late. OLD MOUNTAIN LANE hustled along saved ground to upper stretch weakening late along the rail. HARD WAY WINNER pressed early
then faded on the turn. SWIVEL was always outrun. HE'S SPECIAL folded up on the turn.
