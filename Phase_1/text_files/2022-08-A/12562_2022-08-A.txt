late under strong handling. UNTOUCHED ELEGANCE dueled for the early lead while racing to the outside of Ms Big Spring, raced three wide near the
quarter pole, continued its run off the inside in the stretch and was no match for the winner late. PARCHED GHOST settled off the early pace, made a four
wide advance through the far turn and improved position in the drive. MS BIG SPRING dueled for the early lead and weakened in the stretch run while
racing inside of rivals. HEY DEWZPOTS raced off the early pace, was near the inside at the quarter pole and lacked a bid. HETTY G. was void of early
speed, angled widest through the stretch run and had no rally. MOSLER'S TOUCH was coaxed along early to chase the early pace and stopped.

LISCOLVIN fighting out of the red corner, took control of this bout from the opening bell, held sway around the turn, moved clear effortlessly leaving the
quarter pole, hand ride under the wire. FOCUS tracked the leaders into turn, shifted inside nearing the quarter pole, urged on stretch, raced on the left lead
through the stretch, clearly second best today. THE FURMANATOR raced wide into turn, urged on while still running in the five path, stayed wide top of
lane, moved inside after eighth pole, racing on left lead, finished even under the wire. ARIANA VALENTINA , lacked early speed, chased into turn, outrun
through the stretch. PROVIDING tried early on to stay with run away winner, tracked just off the leaders flank, till nearing the quarter pole, faded through the
stretch.

SEVIER took the lead position soon after the gates opened, clear into turn, came under outside pressure leaving the quarter pole, vigorous ride top of the
stretch, clear late under a drive. SWING WEST four wide into turn, tracked just outside the leader, came under a drive leaving the quarter pole, raced middle
of the lane, running on the left lead, desperately held onto the place money. JOHN'S PROMISE between runners early on, rated off the top pair, moved out
five wide after leaving the quarter pole, angled inside nearing the sixteenth marker, showed good energy late, just missed the place money. NATIVE HAWK
tracked the leaders from the rail position, had nice ground saving trip around the turn, came under steady urging top of stretch, finished even through the
wire. RACK GIN lacked speed away from the gate, chased the pack around the turn, could not make any headway, outrun stretch.

Footnotes
KODAMA (IRE) rated soon after the start, made an advance through the far turn, swung out four to five wide through the upper stretch and just got up under
strong handling. OPEONGO showed good early speed to set the early pace, raced near the two path in the stretch run and was caught near the wire.
PROPER MANNERS was bumped at the break, waited near the quarter pole, raced two to three wide, lacked room in the stretch run and finished gamely to
the wire. WORLD GONE WILD tracked the early leader down the backstretch while racing outside of foe, was four wide near the three sixteenths pole and
kept on to the wire. FLIRTATIOUS LASS was bumped at the break, tracked the top pair from the inside, had to alter out slightly nearing the sixteenth pole,
made its bid while racing near the rail and kept on to the wire. SYSTEMIC RISK was coaxed along early, raced five to six wide and had not enough late.
LADY SIMPATIA was off slowly, raced four deep and had no final winning bid. THISTLEFIELD was void of early speed, angled six to seven wide through
the upper stretch and had no late rally.

INTREPID DAYDREAM broke sharp, took control of the pace while running three wide into turn, searched for a challenger nearing the quarter pole, kept to
task at the furlong marker, cleared off quickly, easy hand ride under the wire. DANCER'S MELODY off the pace into turn, moved four wide making her run
midway on the turn, shifted out seven wide top of the stretch, under a drive gained the place, never a threat to runaway winner. DATE NIGHT KISSES
stalked the leader from the outside, could not quicken with winner around the turn, finished even through the wire. MY FLICKER lacked speed away from
the gate, tracked leaders while racing along the inside, came under drive top of stretch, faded through the lane.

VIBURNUM settled off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn from the inside, raced near the two path in the stretch and finished well to get
up strong encouragement. GRAVITRON showed good early speed to set the early pace, had a clear lead near the eighth pole while racing three wide and
was wore down late in a game effort. DAWN was unhurried early, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and moved up late. SOLEADA raced off
the early pace, moved up four wide near the quarter pole, continued its bid while racing near the four path and improved position with a late rally. MEMPHIS
SHOWBOAT stalked the pace, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive. CENTER STAGE stalked the pace from the inside
and weakened in the drive while racing two to three wide. SWEET SANDY was unhurried early on, raced two to three wide into the lane and had no
response. SEDUCE tracked the early leader while racing in hand, was ridden along near the three eighths pole and tired. MOSALAH failed to sustain a bid.
