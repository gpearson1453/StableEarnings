LUCKY STEPPER bumped at the start, settled off the pace along the inside, shifted out for the drive, closed steadily and drew off near the sixteenth pole.
RED BOTTOM REBEL stumbled and bumped at the start, sprinted clear to set the pace and faltered near the sixteenth pole to finish second best. SHOE
GAME was rated early, raced close to the pace towards the outside, had little left for the drive, lacked the needed response and settled for show. LILA'S
LUCKY LADY was unhurried early, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. EARLYNTHEMORN was never far off the pace while racing between horses,
bid on the second turn, tired, stopped and was not urged through the stretch. Hand timed.

LIMONITE pressed the pace, challenged three across on the turn and drew off past the eighth pole under urging. TW SKIPPING STONES vied inside to the
upper stretch, was unable to sustain his bid and held for place. PAYNTER'S BOY was unhurried early, saved ground, bid inside to loom a threat, hung late
and settled for show. RAIL HUGGER vied two across to the second turn, was checked between horses and dropped back. DILLON ROCKS stalked the
pace, while racing outside, had nothing left for the drive and gave way. The rider of RAIL HUGGER claimed foul against the rider of LIMONITE for alleged
interference on the turn. No change was made.
