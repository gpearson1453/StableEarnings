Footnotes
MY FRIEND FRANK was well rated on the inside throughout, swung four wide leaving the turn and closed well on the outside to get up late under a drive.
BABY BULL vied for the lead three wide and made a three wide bid leaving the turn to gain a short lead leaving the furlong marker and dug in gamely but
was out kicked late to be caught late, good effort. BAVARIA vied for the lead on the inside and faded late, bested rest. LONG GRAY LINE was allowed to
settle on the inside, came four wide into the lane and had a belated rally. BEACH TRAFFIC was off slowly, then tracked the pace three to four wide and had
no kick. ALWAYS FORGIVEN was settled three wide and lacked a rally. SURFER BOY GEORGE was not a factor.

Footnotes
DRAMATIZED was away alertly to set the pace while clear, was well handled and then kept to task to prove best. LOXODROME tracked the early pace four
wide, then stalked the winner two to three wide down the backstretch, but failed to gain late while being second best. PRETENDANT was allowed to settle
early, was two wide on the turn and swung out five wide for the drive, finished well to gain the show award late. LEAVE 'EM LOADED tracked the early pace
between rivals, then rated back and was three wide by the half mile marker, then came three wide into the lanbe and had no kick, lost show late. SHADOW
BOAT was reserved early, came wide into the lane and had a belated rally. SPINNING KITTEN tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. THE TRAIN
was settled on the inside, then clipped heels around the three eighths marker, was not a threat. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA chased the pace four to five wide
and tired.

I GOT A ROCK was off slowly, settled back early, shifted to the outside on the turn, came wide into the lane, closed well on the outside under left handed
crop urging to get up later and win going away. MILITARY DRILL was well placed on the inside, tipped out three wide leaving the turn and finished willingly
but was outfinished by the winner, got bob for place. NOT A TRICK set the pace and dropped to the inside on the turn, then dug in gamely but was caught
late and lost the bob for the place award on the wire. NO FOOLING DUDE staled the paxce four wide early, then was three wide on the turn and came four
wide into the drive and and had no kick. HELLO'NDUBAI chased the pace on the inside, checked on the turn, then tried to come up the inside leaving the
turn, checked and angled out by the furlong marker, then was blocked by the sixteenth pole and checked to the wire, brutal trip. KING ECLIPTICAL chased
the pace and was three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and had no punch. NAUTICAL NATURE lacked a rally while on the inside. PAPA
TONY was reserved early, three wide on the turn and had no rally. ROCKET BLAST bobbled at the start, then put in a dull effort.

SPEED SLOT was fractious in the gate, set a pressured pace3 on the inside, then was headed on the turn and fell back leaving the turn, then came back
again to get up late in a game score. BUSTER BRUNO pressed the pace and made a four wide bid on the turn, took a short lead leaving the turn but hung
late to just miss. GALILEE was allowed to settle, then was three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the drive and had no punch.
ASLUCKWOULDHAVIT pressed the early pace and then vied for command between rivals on the turn and weakened in the drive. MY MAN GEORGIO was
off slowly and raced on the inside and was not a threat.

Footnotes
VALENTINA'S CUPID dueled for the lead on the inside, then was sent down leaving the turn and dug in gamely and prevailed late under a drive in a gutsy
score. AUTOMATED TELLER was rated along early and made a three wide move on the turn to go on even terms for command leaving the turn, but was
outfinished by the winner to just miss. BO RUNKLE lunged at the start, then recovered and was coaxed along the inside to be in contention on the turn, was
blocked by the quarter pole and was awaiting room, had to swing out four wide and then was gaining late, good effort. TALENTED TAPPER dueled outside
the winner early, then vied for command nearing the quarter pole between rivals, but weakened in the drive. PRINCESS ROCIO was taken to the inside and
showed little.
