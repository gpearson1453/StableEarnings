GRACEFUL SPIRIT was quick to begin to set the pace, held good margins through the backstretch, saw margins decrease into the stretch and held. CHABI
went four wide into the opening turn, rated off the pacesetter while four to five wide in the backstretch, went in pursuit of the leader at the quarter pole,
closed gradually and missed. WICKED WIZZY raced close quarters in the opening turn, chased five wide through the backstretch, and lacked the kick
needed. SAGE HILL fanned three wide, saved inside and failed to threaten in drive. BLANCA trailed throughout.

ROYAL STATUS stumbled leaving then pushed to the front, was joined by PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE into the far turn, edged clear under encouragement
and held safely. PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE bumped leaving, raced wide through the backstretch, moved up alongside ROYAL STATUS to challenge the
lead, was unable to get by and held for second. MI REYNA broke out leaving, raced wide, took closer order in the final turn, and missed with a game effort.
JOY IN GRACE hopped leaving, advanced quickly in the final turn along the rail, and improved late. SHE LIKES TO PARTY reserved off the early
pacesetters, and was out kicked. *TIMER MALFUNCTION- The race was hand timed due to a timer malfunction.

SURPRSINGLYPERFECT tracked from the four path, rallied outside GRAY ADMIRAL nearing the stretch, and won driving. GRAY ADMIRAL emerged the
leader leaving the chute, drew clear in the far turn, was overtaken in the final sixteenth and finished clearly second best. CHASKA stumbled hard leaving,
chased from the two path, took closer order in the final turn and had nothing left in reserve late. TANNIN reserved off the leaders from the four path, and
chased to no avail. CATS TOUCH some early speed inside, saddle slipped and walked off. BARE BACK JACK broke poorly then was pulled up, did not
finished and walked off.

Footnotes
LAST OF WAR saved ground inside, took closer order then drove between foes after the quarter pole, struck the front and held sway.
SHAKINOFFTHERUST allowed to settle mid pack, moved up closer into striking position along the rail, swung four wide off the final turn, and was out
kicked. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH fractious in the gate, set a pressured pace inside of AMUSING WAY, dueled through the far turn, drifted in at the head of
the stretch, and weakened in the final sixteenth. AMUSING WAY pressed the pace outside, dueled through the final turn outside of INDEPENDENCE
NEIGH, and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. HANDSOME HENRY tracked the dueling pacesetters through the backstretch, came under urging in
the final turn and faded. STUBBORN LOVE trailed the field early, chased outside and tired. VIRTUAL SILVER chased wide leaving the backstretch and
yielded.

LITTLE DIEGO saved ground early, gained closer order nearing the quarter pole, lodged a rail bid sweeping the lead, and drew clear. SOMETHIN
HAPPENIN rated just off the pace inside, inched clear of rival but was no match for the eventual winner in the drive and finished evenly. GOLD'S UP raced
four wide into the opening turn, reserved off the early pacesetters, gained closer order nearing the final turn, and got up late for show. WIDE EYED WILEY
hustled to the front, set the pace from the two path, was unable to move on with rival into the stretch and was caught late. AMIGO QUERIDO tracked five
wide through the backstretch, chased in the far turn, and flattened in drive. MEAN STREAK stalked the early pacesetters from the three path, and failed to
menace in the drive. REMAIN CALM trailed throughout.
