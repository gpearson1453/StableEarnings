Footnotes
SNOOZER soon moved clear of the rest, was allowed to relax after a half mile, roused into the lane, drifted out some midstretch but held sway under steady
handling. KEEP ATTACKING settled early, gradually progressed two wide, reached a striking position three wide on the second turn, moved ahead for
second upper stretch, drifted out inside the last eighth, held a straight path the final sixteenth but was too late. DEORA STORE advanced from along the
rail, came off the inside to make a run at SNOOZER on the second turn, leveled off some in the lane, altered in when the latter took his path midstretch,
finished evenly but was easily best of the rest. FINE GRAYDAR chased from outside, picked up his pace after a half mile, closed the gap along the rail on
the second bend but gave way for the drive. CYCLONE ATTACK raced closest to SNOOZER for more than a half mile while in path three then faded. RAZ
COUNTRY was away somewhat slowly and showed little.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE stalked the early speed from outside, quickly took over when let out four wide on the bend then steadily opened up in the lane
while under urging until wrapped with seventy yards left. COPPER CROSSING raced in contention from just off the inside, fanned four wide for the stretch
run and took over second nearing the final sixteenth. EVIDENCE vied for the early lead from just off the rail, did not stay with WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE on
the turn, fought to hold second in the lane but did not have enough left deep stretch. EL ROMANTICO was a step slow at the break then hustled up from
inside, saved ground taking the bend and failed to have a significant stretch response. TSALI fractious in the gate, was prominent between rivals, advanced
four wide on the turn, fanned out further for the drive, fought for second upper stretch then flattened out. TEARS ON A RIVER displayed early speed just
outside EVIDENCE, vied for second between horses on the bend then began to yield before finishing five furlongs. SWEET LITTLE RUE was also a step
slow at the start, stayed off the rail and showed little.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF MAYHEM broke in stride, sprinted away from the rest, was relaxed on the backstretch, roused leaving the second bend, floated out some into
the lane and kept TRY TRY AGAIN at bay under steady handling. TRY TRY AGAIN gradually closed the gap on PRINCE OF MAYHEM from just off the
inside, altered in when his path was taken nearing the furlong marker, loomed a serious threat deep stretch but did not have enough in the waning yards.
RULE FOLLOWER crowded briefly after the break, advanced from outside on the backstretch, reached contention between horses after a half mile, was in
tight between rivals through the second turn, his rider lost his whip entering the lane and gradually edged ahead for third under hand urging. JOHNNY
LONGBOAT without early speed, angled in on the backstretch, was just off the rail on the second turn, fanned out to path four into the stretch, altered
outside JOEY B with a sixteenth left and continued to close the gap belated through the waning yards. JOEY B progressed from the outside on the
backstretch to reach a striking position four wide on the second turn but flattened out for the drive. ROAR OF THE LION soon trailed, stayed off the inside,
swung out widest for the stretch run and improved position late without threatening. DRAW THE LINE gradually retreated from off the inside, saved ground
through the second bend and had little to offer for drive. TOCCETIVE JAC chased from just off or along the rail and was never a factor. YALIKEANYTHING
steadily faded from inside, proved unresponsive to hand encouragement in the lane, was eased late and walked off.

WINDY SLEW into the turn, angled outside the latter on the bend, floated out further into the lane, was all out but came up short. DRAGONFLY KISSES
chased from outside, angled in on the turn and could only made up minor ground the last furlong.

Footnotes
IMAGINE GOLD was hustled up from outside, progressed through path three on the bend, was all out the final furlong and edged ahead in time. SIMPLY
FAST moved up from outside to prompt the pace, swiftly took the lead earl in the turn, stayed just off the rail, was under urging in the lane, did not have
enough left but was clearly second best. BEZEL SET chased from between horses, advanced four wide on the bend, fanned out further for the stretch run
and caught ABBMAR for third inside the final sixteenth. ABBMAR moved to a clear lead and to the inside after a furlong, did not stay with SIMPLY FAST on
the turn and flattened out for the stretch run. AIKEN TO BE TAKIN well placed from inside, began to yield before finishing three furlongs. PRINCESS
CONSUELA made a small leap from the gate, gradually angled in on the backstretch, faded while boxed in on the turn, angled to the outside upper stretch
and improved position without threatening. PRETTY GITA raced in contention two or three wide in the early going but yielded between rivals on the bend.
LILLY BELLE soon trailed, stayed wide and showed little. CARMEN O'ELECTRA helped prompt the pace in close quarters between rivals on the
backstretch but gave way with three furlongs left.

DOROTA bumped with SHEEZ KOLDAZICE at the break, soon moved clear, showed the way in hand just off or along the rail, was urged in the lane and
kept SHEZZ KOLDAZICE at bay. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE bumped with DOROTA at the start, prompted the latter from just outside, lacked the needed late kick
but proved easily second best. MARIA'S GIFT chased from outside, advanced three wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run, steadily
progressed under urging and caught FRIEND for third at the wire. FRIEND progressed from inside on the turn, took over third upper stretch, gradually
angled out inside the furlong marker and leveled off. CAIRO SUMMER raced in the second flight on the backstretch but began to fade two wide on the bend.
NOT TO BE DENIED was a factor toward the outside in the early going, angled in with four furlongs left and soon gave way. EMILY LANE failed to menace.

Footnotes
ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM stalked the early speed from outside, took over when let out into the second turn, angled in nearing the quarter pole, widened
command under urging upper stretch and maintained control. AROSE FOR LYLA in contention just off the inside, advanced three wide on the second bend,
was bumped briefly upper stretch, moved ahead for second inside the final furlong, lugged in under right-handed pressure approaching the sixteenth marker
and was clearly second best. HOT DAME broke on top, gradually floated out as she led the way on the backstretch, was overtaken from outside on the
second turn, angled in with two furlongs to go, moved toward the outside upper stretch, bumped briefly with AROSE FOR LYLA, was corrected, checked
solidly when the latter took her path nearing the sixteenth pole, altered out some, did not have enough left but was unchallenged for third. INDICIA soon
trailed while toward the outside, advanced two wide on the second bend, fanned out widest entering the lane, angled in deep stretch and had no significant
bid. WAR COLORS pressed HOT DAME from outside, angled inside that one midway on the backstretch, had the rail on the second turn, was steadied
behind HOT DAME at the quarter pole, began to fade as she fanned out into the lane, moved to the outside approaching the last furlong and continued to
yield. SAMARITA raced in contention along the inside for nearly five furlongs then gave way. The rider of HOT DAME lodged an objection alleging
interference from AROSE FOR LYLA inside the last furlong. After their review, the stewards determined that HOT DAME did lose action inside the last
eighth but it did not affect the final outcome of the race and the objection was not upheld.
