JUSTIN SPEIGHT was bumped at the start, set the pace while clear, then dug in gamely in the drive and held sway late to prove best under a drive. BILOXI
was bumped hard at the start, settled three wide, came four wide into the lane and closed well to just miss. PITCH AND RUN was well placed along the
inside, was boxed by the quarter pole, tried to shift out by the three sixteenths but was kept in by AINT THAT A KICK and was blocked by the pacesetter,
then dropped to the inside by the furlong marker and was gaining late but needed more. AIN'T THAT A KICK tracked the pace and made a three wide bid
leaving the turn but flattened out late. UNCLE BRAD was bumped at the start, then checked shortly after the break, then was not a threat.
ATTITUDOFGRATITUDE was off slowly and was not a factor. KINGDOM STAR was through early.
