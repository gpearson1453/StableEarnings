Footnotes
ARIA APERTA away well, went to lead, briefly challenged by outside rival, too fast for rival and cleared heading into turn, improved margin through the turn
and won easily. AUNT OPAL away cleanly showed enough speed to hold rail on the backstretch, continued chasing clear leader on the rail, proved no
match for winner while being a well clear second place. ADMIRAL AESCHBACH off a tad slow and brushed with rival, asked to show speed and chased
clear leader three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered stretch in range of the second horse, lacked needed kick in the lane to
improve and just lasted to hold third by winning a head bob. SWEET N GO stalked pace well off the rail on the backstretch, continued the wide trip on the
turn, launched mild bid widest, and just missed third at the wire. AUNTIE BEV asked for speed, chased leader in between rivals on the backstretch,
continued in between on the turn and failed to finish well enough in the lane to hold on to show money.
