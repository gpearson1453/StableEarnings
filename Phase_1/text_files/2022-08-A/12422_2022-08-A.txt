Footnotes
VICTORY BOLT sped to the lead at the start and angled to the inside, held firm two wide around the turn, roused for more at the head of the lane,
responded, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task under a driving finish. ADD IT ALL UP tracked the pacesetter into the turn, chased two to three
wide into the upper stretch and held place. RAISIN RAISIN was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, chased three wide around the turn and ran
on for a share. BAYLEYWICK got in tight and steadied along the rail in opening stages, remained inside in range and given cue near the quarter pole,
sustained bid into upper stretch then flattened out. COLD AS YOU raced off the early pace, urged three to four wide into the lane and failed to threaten.
SHIPS JEWEL chased three to four wide around the turn then retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
DONNA'S HOPE broke on top then edged back into tracking position, came three wide into upper stretch, given cue at the furlong marker, responded
willingly, took command and kicked clear. CATALE dueled inside of IVY BAD GIRL into opening stages and battled on around the turn, shook free to a slim
lead a furlong out then got overtaken by the winner. REBA chased the top pair along inside around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, shifted out four
wide for a clear path a furlong out, finished with response and just missed place. PAPA'S SECRET was reserved racing in the back, swung four to five wide
into the lane and improved position. GOLDEN SHOT was not too far back off the pace, chased three to four wide around the turn and failed to kick on. IVY
ABAD GIRL dueled outside of CATALE in opening stages, battled on into upper stretch then came up empty.

Footnotes
BLAZE AWAY N HIDE broke alertly from the outside, cleared and angled in, set the early pace and held firm around the turn, widened to clear advantage in
upper stretch and kept to task under steady pressure. DIVA TREVA chased inside to wide around the turn, sustained a bid for the winner through the lane
and finished second best. JETS A GINNIN was forwardly soon after the start, chased three wide around the turn and ran on for a share. MY GOLDEN DAY
settled through early stages then swung five wide into the lane and failed to rally. ITALIAN JUSTICE raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn
and never threatened. CURLIN BLESSING raced in range three to four wide around the turn then gave way.

Footnotes
SOCIAL CIRCLE set the pace through the backstretch, vied for the lead with LONG MONDAY at the quarter pole, shook free in upper stretch, stayed on
gamely and held firm. JAVISTHA stalked the early pace, coaxed three wide around the far turn, sustained steady response into the lane and cleared second
best. LONG MONDAY tracked the leader through the backstretch, edged forward and dueled with the winner at the quarter pole, failed to match strides at
the head of the lane and flattened to show. FANCY GI GI rated off the pace and saved ground, was ridden three to four wide into the lane and improved
position without threatening. DIXIELAND CANDY raced off the top trio midway through the backstretch, failed to advance under pressure around the far turn
and gave way. FLATOUTANDFOXY raced two to three wide and failed to move into contention. SHE'S A BIG STAR was not too far back going by the half
mile marker then came up empty around the far turn.
