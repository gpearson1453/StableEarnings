STARSTRUCK NOTION was off a step slow, raced close up on the inside, chased on the turn, rallied on the rail passing the furlong marker, made a late bid
and was up in time for the win. FIXED ODDS showed sharp early speed, set the pace racing off the inside, led into the stretch, dug in gamely between rivals
passing the furlong marker and was caught in the final strides. STEEL DRIVIN MAN steadied at the start, stalked close up outside, bid outside of FIXED
ODDS on the turn, then dug in gamely outside in the stretch drive. BURN EM steadied a bit at the start, chased three wide, raced three wide on the turn and
lacked a rally. RANUNCULUS raced off the rail, off the pace, came wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ISLAND SPIRIT was off a bit slow, chased
inside, then between rivals at the half mile marker, faded in the lane. FOOLS FAREWELL chased between rivals early on and gave way.

GAROPPOLO stalked close up two wide, pressed the pace on the backside, bid on the far turn, dueled with TEMPESTUOUS into the stretch, dug in gamely
outside, wore down that rival and edged away for the win. TEMPESTUOUS bobbled at the break, set the pace on the inside, dueled with GAROPPOLO on
the far turn, dug in gamely inside of that rival in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly. AUSTIN WHYLIE had a three wide trip raced off the pace, came
four wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside for third. ANGELI BLU tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and rallied mildly. ORIGO raced
off the pace between rivals, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. CLASSY UNION trailed the field and did not factor. SUNSANDDRINKINHAND
stalked two wide, then three wide, chased on the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
DEEP FAITH raced off the pace, advanced on the backside, made a three wide run on the far turn, ran past STRATEGIC nearing the furlong marker, drew
off, was ridden out and wrapped up late. STRATEGIC set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the far turn, dueled with the winner at the
quarter pole, was no match, then dug in to save the place spot. LEOPARDI bobbled at the break, tracked inside early, then stalked two wide, chased
between rivals on the far turn, bid and weakened. SIR CUPID raced off the pace, inside on the far turn and did not factor. SOUL PROVIDER was outrun.
