Footnotes
ERAWAN bumped with ON THE ENGINE soon after the break, was alertly taken to the inner rail entering the first turn, remained along the rail there after,
bid for the lead inside FEDERAL OFFENSE near the eighth pole and determinedly prevailed. FEDERAL OFFENSE assumed the early lead, set the pace
near the inner rail, drifted out at the head of the stretch giving the winner room and gave way grudginly. ON THE ENGINE bumped with the winner leaving
the starting gate, steadied when outrun for early position, stalked the pace down the backstretch, eased out to the three path leaving the far turn, floated
four wide in upper stretch and flattened out. STREET LAMP prompted the pace outside FEDERAL OFFENSE and gave way in upper stretch. SAINT
MARCO raced in the three path between horses on the first turn, saved ground on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and was never a factor.
MARQUET MALICE , along the inner rail on the far turn, was outrun. MENTALIST , four deep the first turn, was done on the far turn. THE DUNGEON
trailed.

Footnotes
ALAS AND ALACK settled off the early pace while a touch green, saved ground into the turn then eased out to advance between runners approaching the
stretch, dropped back down towards the rail leaving the three sixteenths, snuck through to the inside of rivals to challenge in mid stretch, gained a slim lead
a sixteenth out and dug in tenaciously under solid handling to prove best. BLAME CATALAYA broke a step slow then was bumped, regrouped and moved
up nearing the half mile marker, took closer order behind the leaders mid turn, angled out nearing the lane and straightened to be about five wide, closed in
outside rivals through the final sixteenth, drifted in a bit and finished gamely while just falling short. MYSISTERNANCY had speed to lead early then was
joined and passed from her inside after a furlong, tracked and rebid between foes mid turn, gained a slim lead nearing the lane then drifted out a path,
fought on past the eighth pole while under strong encouragement between runners but wasn't quite good enough. NAMAJUNAS stalked three wide, moved
to threaten mid turn, was fanned four wide dueling into the stretch, straightened and gained the advantage inside the three sixteenths, failed to kick on with
rivals in the final seventy yards and gave way. ANATH came out at the break bumping BLAME CATALAYA, steadied soon after, dropped off the pace, was
under asking three wide past the five sixteenths and lacked a stretch kick. MISS FUSSY PANTS , fractious in the gate, lost ground four wide pursuing the
pace, remained wide into the lane and faded. SWEET FACTOR was hard sent along the rail and moved to the lead after a furlong, was collared by a pair of
rivals mid turn, stayed on to the head of the lane then faltered.

Footnotes
ALBERTANO , showing improved speed, raced in range while saving some ground, came under a ride leaving the half mile marker, shifted out four wide
with sights set on the leaders soon into the lane, kept grinding under a drive and rolled up outside to engage nearing the sixteenth pole, sustained under
pressure, forged ahead late and was edging away in the final jumps. BOONDOGGLE had speed speed then rated off MONEYINTHEBANKSEY, tracked
that one in in hand mid turn, moved three wide to draw alongside entering the lane, took over soon after, shook clear a furlong out, dug in when joined by
the winner, dueled then gave way grudgingly. MONYINTHEBANKSEY sped to command towards the inside and went clear after a quarter mile, met
BOONDOGGLE'S bid nearing the five sixteenths, ceded with a quarter to go, stayed on to battle past mid stretch and kept on with effort. BIG RINNE , off
the pace, raced two to three wide in upper stretch, swung out past the quarter pole and churned on. ANTIPOISON bobbled a bit at the break, lost contact
leaving the far turn, dropped far back then was eased when distanced.

Footnotes
BELLA BETTINA bobbled leaving the starting gate, was snugly rated along the inner rail down the backstretch, eased out to the two path mid way on the
turn, advanced between horses entering the stretch, gained command outside ASHARA near the eighth pole, was under brisk, left hand urging and drew
clear. ASHARA sprinted clear early, set the pace slightly off the inner rail around the turn, failed to hold off the winner but finished willingly to be well clear of
the rest. TANKA TOUGH saved ground around the turn while chasing the pace and weakened through the final furlong. AT THE GATE , a forward factor
outside horses around the turn, was four deep turning for home and weakened. IMINCHARGENOW was not a factor. POLICE WOMAN in the three path
chasing the pace around the turn, faltered in upper stretch. TWO TIMES LUCKY broke slowly and trailed.

VINNY cleared early, dictated the early pace two wide, turned away a rail bid from CONTENTED NOW nearing the far turn, spurted back clear leaving the
far turn and was nursed to the head of the lane, responded when give his cue and eagerly widened under a solid hand ride. AFTERMATH settled off the
pace while saving ground, came under pressure leaving the far turn, angled out past the five sixteenths and circled five wide into the lane, straightened
away and churned on with interest to gain the place. AXXERATOR , four wide while fighting restraint the opening five sixteenths, moved up off the rail
nearing the far turn, chased into the lane but was out kicked for the place. CONTENTED NOW broke a beat slow after having his head turned slightly just
before the gates sprung, recovered and edged up to stalk, moved through along the rail to challenge approaching the half mile marker, failed to quicken with
the winner, stayed on to chase to the head of the stretch then faded. URBAN WARRIOR stalked off the rail, loomed three wide in a good spot leaving the far
turn, had no kick outside a rival past the five sixteenths and weakened. WHERE'S THE BEN'S broke slowly and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SPOTAKE , bumped at the break, regrouped and settled off of a contested pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, circled six wide into the
lane, bid outside rivals in mid stretch, took command inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a drive. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY drifted in and bumped with
the winner at the break, corrected and saved ground as a duel was going on up front, cut the corner with momentum into the stretch, bid inside foes with a
furlong to go and continued gamely to earn the place. PRAY FOR THE U S A advanced inside rivals to take over after a furlong, was joined from her outside
around the turn, dueled, wandered outward while on the lead in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. BEARGREASE , off the pace and three wide mid
turn, failed to seriously kick on. SILVER'S GIRL stumbled at the break, quickly regrouped and vied briefly between, rated off the leaders into the turn, angled
five wide into the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and weakened. HOT SPICE bid two wide outside the leader leaving the far turn, dueled
past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and faltered.
