Footnotes
BYE BYE HEATH was away in good order to stalk the pace of PERFECT IMAGE while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and quickly drew off. RYDERS UP was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, could not reach the
winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. ATTILAS TORNADO was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with some late
run. PERFECT IMAGE set a pressured pace from the inside for a half and gave way. SWAYEM lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled
out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and was not a factor. FLAG THE FOOTNOTE was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to
menace. AWAY I GO was taken back at the start and lagged far back throughout.

Footnotes
COWBOY TOBY raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the closing yards.
MAINFRAME JUDY raced just off the leaders while under restraint from the inside, pulled to the lead with a furlong to run, rebuffed the bid of DIABOLICAL
KING with sixteenth to run but could not hold the winner off from over the top. DIABOLICAL KING was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the
turn, offered a bid nearing the sixteenth pole but failed to sustain that rally. COYSTER broke sharply to duel for the early advantage while racing four-wide
and gave way in the drive. BOOMER WHO lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CAMINETTO was away in good order to
dispute the early fractions from the inside and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
TRUEZER was away in good order to stalk the pace of INFINITE HEAT while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths
pole, responded when that rival came back to engage with a furlong to run, vied and edged away late. INFINITE HEAT veered out at the start, opened a
clear lead soon after, responded when challenged by the winner into the lane, came back to offer a bid with a furlong to run but could not hold that foe safe
late. LEAD MONTEREY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, checked nearing the three-sixteenths pole, angled in and finished
willlingly. CHIPPSTER was squeezed back at the start, lagged early, saved ground through the turn and finished with some late run. WILEO PROCEED
lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to menace. ZESTY JAZZMAN was forwardly placed from the inside, angled out approaching
the stretch and weakened. TRUELY RIGHT was bumped at the start, raced off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and weakened. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AND INQUIRY CONCERNING THE VEERING OUT AT THE START OF INFINITE HEAT ALSO THE RIDER AND TRAINER
OF CHIPPSTER LODGED OBJECTIONS CONCERING HOW CHIPPSTER WAS EFFECTED AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED INFINITE HEAT FROM SECOND AND PLACED HIM SEVENTH FOR THE INFRACTION.

BETTER BELIEVE set a pressured pace while saving ground, opened a clear margin nearing the three-sixteenths marker and drew off through the lane with
complete authority. SHEZA HAILSTORM broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, could not get to that foe in the drive but
finished willingly. ATILLAS ANGEL was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and failed to gain late. DOER NOT A
FAKER settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. PRETTY PEPPY lacked early foot, saved ground through the
turn and finished with a belated bid. BYE BYE BROOKY was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. BRYNS MARK
raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. MAMA WAS A ROCKET raced off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. STORMY DAME lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. LADIES
SISTER was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
STORM LEADER tracked the pace of NOSTRANGERTOTHERAIN from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew
off as an easy winner. GEORGE WHO settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, could not gain on the
winner but finished well to gain the place. LEAVE THEM BEHIND chased the leaders while racing four-wide, was no match for the winner but stayed on well
in the drive. VALENTINO WHO lacked early speed, steadied from the three-sixteenths to the eighth pole and finished with good energy when clear. MR
RIGGER was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. PAINTED SMOKE lagged early, raced three-wide
through the turn and failed to menace. NOSTRANGRTOTHERAIN sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and weakened in the final
furlong.. RATTILA settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. HENNESSY LOOKER RF was void of early
foot, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention.
