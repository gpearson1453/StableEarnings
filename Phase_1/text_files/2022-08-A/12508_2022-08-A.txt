Footnotes
SUMMER MATE was rated along the inside tracking just off the first flight to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and responded
to energetic handling to take over in the final sixteenth. TAKING CHARGE DESI, in touch prompting a rival's pace in the opening half, pressed the issue on
the far turn into upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors while failing to contain the winner. BOMBARRA GOLD, urged along the inside dictating the
pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, dueled for command through the far turn into the lane and weakened late. USA USA USA tracked off the
first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch but came up empty entering the far turn. FINAL TABLE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
THAT'S NOT FUNNY, in touch with the leader attending the pace between foes under light rating in the opening half, pressed the issue on the far turn into
upper stretch and kicked clear late under firm encouragement. RUNAWAY READY angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch,
conceded some position under patient handling nearing upper stretch, shifted out to the four path racing through the lane and continued with a steady late
effort to prevail for the place honors at the wire. LORING PARK, in touch with the leaders three wide racing to the backstretch, was eased off the leaders
nearing upper stretch, continued willingly between foes past midstretch and just missed for second. MR. D'S LEGEND, caught in tight quarters along the
inside leaving the chute, tipped to the two path on the backstretch tracking off the first flight, angled inside entering the far turn while being prompted to
advance but lacked the needed late bid. BUBBA BOB, urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, shifted off the rail
disputing the issue into upper stretch and gave way late. GABRIEL'S LEGEND, reserved near the inside racing to the backstretch, angled to the five path
racing into upper stretch but lacked a rally. PIRATE BIRD trailed throughout.

RUBY'S RED DEVIL broke awkwardly while hitting the gate losing position to the field, steadily regained contention while angling to the rail racing into the
bend, made a steady rally to challenge for command inside foes leaving midstretch and went clear under firm right handed encouragement. RANGER GUS
was urged forcing the pace outside a rival from the outset into the turn, edged forward nearing midstretch but proved no match when confronted by the
winner. DEPUTY LAW dueled for command inside a rival from the outset into the turn, tipped off the rail racing into upper stretch and yielded to the top pair
leaving the furlong marker. WEAREINITTOWINIT tracked off the first flight four wide through the backstretch into the turn, continued wide to upper stretch
and never menaced. SING N SPURS tracked just off the first flight three wide racing to the turn and gave way into upper stretch. SHAQ'S MY DADDY was
taken up in early stages while angling to the inside, quickly lost contact with the field while continuing on his own courage, then walked off the course under
his own power.

HARD ATTACK was urged to a position tracking just off the pacesetter a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, conceded some position to that foe
midway through the backstretch, continued with a steady advance nearing upper stretch and contested the issue in a prolonged drive to narrowly prevail in
time under firm handling. BIGFOOT CITY broke sharply, was urged clear along the rail setting the pace into the backstretch, dictated terms to upper stretch,
then grudgingly resisted the winner to the end to just miss. HOLD THE SPICE was rated inside foes tracking the leaders in second flight racing to the far
turn, tipped out to the three path entering the stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share. WAR CHEST broke outwards bumping CHEST
CANDY at the start, was righted to track the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the far turn but had no closing bid. CHEST CANDY, bumped at
the start, was held up off the second flight while angling to the inside, saved ground to the lane but had no closing bid. T BONES TRICK tracked the leaders
three wide as part of the second flight racing to the first turn, dropped back from that position into the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
CASEY'S LAW tracked off the first flight three wide racing to the turn, continued with a steady bid to challenge for command racing into upper stretch,
shifted inwards once gaining the advantage but went clear under brisk handling. MASTER RED was urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset
into the turn, dueled to midstretch and edged a rival for second late when failing to match the winner. HURTS SO BAD, urged between foes pressing the
pace through the backstretch into the turn, dueled to midstretch and weakened late. IRISH DAWN, urged between foes pursuing the leaders in the opening
furlong, was eased back from between foes dropping into last nearing the turn, swung out to race five wide into upper stretch, shifted inwards under
pressure entering the lane, then came around rivals late but continued with interest to gain position to the end. ROMEO'S GLORY settled outside foes in the
opening stages, was caught five wide racing into the bend, then to upper stretch but offered no rally. PRIZE FIGHTER, pinched back at the start, switched
out nearing the turn splitting rivals four deep, moved to make brief progress in that path on the turn but came up empty in the drive. STORM'S
REFLECTION tracked off the first flight along the inside through the backstretch and steadily faded racing into the turn. GLASSATO swerved while being
prompted contend in the opening stages, tracked off the first flight three wide between foes racing into the turn and steadily retreated into the lane.

Footnotes
MARVELOUS THUNDER, bumped at the start, was quickly righted to track off the second flight along the inside in the opening stages, was prompted to
advance inside foes racing into the bend, tipped off the inside racing into upper stretch, split rivals when presented an opening midstretch challenging for
command, shifted to the inside in the closing stages and edged forward under some right handed pressure. RIDING THE TRAIN broke readily, stalked just
off the first flight between foes racing into the bend, shifted out three wide nearing the lane to bid for command, was fanned four wide through the stretch but
continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. JUST RIGHT MIKE angled inwards from the outset while being urged to force the pace outside a rival
racing into the bend, gained a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, drifted out nearing midstretch and weakened between foes late while lasting for a
share. BAYOU GEM tracked off the second flight three deep between foes in early, shifted inwards a bit on the turn and continued with an effort to gain
position between rivals to the end. YANKEE INDIAN was urged along the inside disputing the pace from the outset into the turn and faded into upper
stretch. PUBLIC SAFETY, rank between foes in the opening stages, switched out of close quarters to race four wide into the turn, then into the lane but
failed to gain striking distance. DIABLO CUERNO tracked just off the first flight racing four wide into the turn, was fanned five wide nearing the land and
steadily faded in the drive. GLASS EATER tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside nearing the lane and
steadily faded. SKY CONFIDENTIAL broke inwards bumping the eventual winner, then was shuffled out of tight quarters early and trailed the field to the
stretch.
