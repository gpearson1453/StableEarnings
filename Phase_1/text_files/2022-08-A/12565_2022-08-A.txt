Footnotes
POST CLOSE allowed the leaders to go early, raced off the inside up the backstretch, dropped to the inside turn, cut the corner when advancing on that pair
turning for home, challeged inside the leader with less than a furlong remaining, drew clear under steady handling. HIGH CRUISE moved up to contest the
pace out of the chute, narrowly showed the way backstretch closest to the inside, shook clear in the turn and into the stretch, allowed the winner the inside
with under a furlong remaining, could not keep pace with that one late, all out to preserve the place. MASTERLY pressured the runner up early to that one's
outside, fell back off that rival through the turn, three wide into the lane, slowly getting back to that same foe late while also unable to keep up with the
winner late. RUNAWAY TRACY fell back to trail after the start and was never a threat.

MALFORMED broke alertly, pressed the pace while in the two path and between foes, took over entering the stretch, shook clear under a brisk hand ride
past the furlong marker, geared down late to win ridden out. ALEXAPLAYBORNTORUN moved up to set the pace soon after the start, continued to hold a
narrow advantage through the turn, could not keep pace with the winner through the stretch, clearly second best. SUGAR STAR last to leave, trailed while
saving ground into and through the turn, shifted out around a couple of idling rivals with less than a furlong remaining,up late for the show spot while not a
threat to the top pair. BRAVE OLLIE pressed the issue from the outside, four wide into the turn, had little left for the final furlong, caught for the show.
MYDEALOFTHEDAY forced the issue in the three path and between foes for just over a quarter and began to tire, continued to falter down the lane.

Footnotes
CRIMSON STORM broke alertly, allowed the early leader to go, stalked that one into the turn, took over in the three path entering the stretch, drew clear
under steady handling that included a couple of right handed crops. CORN POP in the second flight along the rail and inside the winner, continued to save
ground turn while in a forward position, came in the two path for the drive, bothered ever so slightly when MAJESTIC MANDATE came out with a furlong
remaining then wore that same rival down for the second spot. MAJESTIC MANDATE broke just behind the winner, asked to clear early, showed the way
through the turn along the inside, proved no match in the drive, came out bit midstretch, proved stubborn for the second spot until late while remaining on
the inside. TAPIT TO THE LINE last to leave, trailed inside for three furlongs, moved out a bit for the drive and was closing the gap on the show finisher late.
TOO MUCH CROWN void of speed, was never dangerous while racing off the inside. EL DURANGO was finished after three furlongs, trailed home.

Footnotes
PAYTONSATTHEPLATE settled off the early pace in the two path, continued unhurried into and through the final turn while saving ground, closer in upper
stretch, switched out past the furlong marker when in a drive, finished with good resolve to be in time at thge wire. ANGEL OF VERDUN broke alertly, clear
before a quarter, continued to set a relaxed pace the middle half, continued to hold a daylight advantage past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to
the winner late while remaining clear of the others. ISOLATION closest to the runner up off the inside, continued to chase that one up the backstretch,
lodged a brief and mild bid midway on the second turn, flattened out in the drive, best of the rest. MI LIA within striking distance for much of the way toward
the inside, had little left for the drive. FOUR PRINCESSES broke back, failed to menace while racing outside. BEYOND D'ORO raced in mid pack for six
furlongs, gave way when the real running began turning for home.

Footnotes
GRAHAM 'S CRUISER raced in mid pack along the inside for a half, in traffic and waited briefly late in the turn, got through along the rail then steered out
into the two path under clever handling entering the stretch, took command between horses inside the furlong marker, dug in late to hold off the runner up in
a game effort. JIMMIE'S HALO back off the pace while racing outside, moved closer while four wide turning for home, lost some ground to the leaders as a
result, got back to the winner with an outside bid late, denied. DRAFT CHOICE chased the early leader, advanced on that one and challenged in the two
path entering the stretch, dropped to the inside as the winner was steering out in upper stretch, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker but could
not last. STEALING APRIORITY within striking distance off the inside, advanced with a brief and mild bid three wide turning for home, flattened out through
the stretch. HOPE FOR CHANGE void of speed for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while racing toward the inside without posing a serious threat.
MR. SNOWFLAKE broke on top, sprinted clear out of the chute, continued to show the way into the turn, dueled through much of that bend then faltered
when headed turning for home. BIG RESULTS remained back in failing to menace.

Footnotes
ZEEROCK came out into the first turn to bother outer rivals, three wide into the far turn when beginning a steady advance, remained in the three path into
the stretch, collared the leader just inside the furlong grounds, dug in late when confronted from the inside and narrowly prevailed under firm handling.
GLENNEYMAX settled off the pace toward the inside, began to advance far turn, moved around a tiring foe in the two path midway on that bend, dropped to
the rail turning for home, challenged late inside the winner, denied while holding sway for the place. ST. MONICA void of early foot, advanced into
contention in the four path through the final turn, remained prominent between foes a furlong out, lacked a closing punch. SHOOTING STICK in tight then
bumped and jostled between horses into the first turn, remained back up the backstrech, encountered some traffic into the far turn, came four wide and clear
for the drive, finished willinglyt while widest of the first flight at the wire. KATIE'S C off slowly to spot the field a couple of lengths, bumped when four wide
into the first turn, moved up steadily backstretch, took over final turn, showed the way into the lane then weakened when confronted the final furlong to lose
several positions. STERLING MEMORY bumped when between into the first turn, renmained back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals late while never in
contention. CAESAR'S CALPURNIA asked to clear early from the outside, long lead early, stopped when headed far turn. LA LOLA chased the early leader
then began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
SPRY CHARLIE with the early pace between foes, put a head in front turning for home under confident handling, drew clear under moderate pressure
toward the inside. BULLETSREVENGE with the pace while on the outside in the run up the backstretch, vied three wide turn, drifted out a bit upper stretch,
clearly second best. GENES FEATHER unruly in the paddock, narrowly set the pace along the inside for almost three furlongs, began to weaken when
replaced on the lead by the winner entering the stretch. MALIBU MONEY chased the first flight while toward the inside,continued evenly through the lane in
lacking a closing response. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY lacked early foot off the inside, three wide through the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the
issue had been decided. CHELSEA'S GLORY off a step slow, raced four wide through the turn and was never dangerous. BIG RUSSSS tired after racing
three to four wide through the turn. SEISMIC STRENGTH fell back to trail soon after the start, showed little to be always outrun.
