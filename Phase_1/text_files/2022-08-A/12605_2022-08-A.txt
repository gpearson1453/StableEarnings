Footnotes
SHOUT IT OUT was off a step slowly and chased from the rear to the turn, was steered off of the rail to go three wide nearing the top of the lane, loomed in
mid-stretch and kicked away in the final stages. WETHERLY showed early speed and raced close to the early pace, dueled for the lead nearing the quarter
marker, continued to battle into mid-stretch, could not keep pace with the winner in the late stages, drifted in in the final sixteenth and held for second.
ZAKKIYYAH tracked the early pace, maintained position on the turn, was outkicked in the drive but stayed on to secure third. BANDON BRIDGE hopped at
the start, chased the pace to the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker and did not offer a late rally. CHIQUITA PIQUITA was sent to the early lead,
set decent fractions through the turn, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, battled with WETHERLY to mid-stretch, could not match strides with the
leaders in the final furlong and was crowded in the final stages by a drifting rival while unable to produce a late response.

HAPPY DOES stalked the early moderate pace, advanced on the backstretch run, confronted the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, took command into
the drive, was all out in the final sixteenth when challenged by the runner-up but gamely held on for the win. CALI CONQUEST was off a bit slowly and
lagged through the early going, gained ground nearing the second turn, swung widest into the drive, found his best stride late, made a strong run in the final
sixteenth and just missed at the line for the win, while clear of the rest for second. CALCULATED SPIN stalked the pace while maintaining a two wide path
through the backstretch run, advanced on the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong but held for third at the end.
SMOKIN' HOT bobbled at the start and bumped CODIS BREAKER leaving the break, recovered and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions
through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace in upper stretch and was outfinished in the lane. CODIS
BREAKER stumbled a bit at the start then made contact with SMOKIN' HOT leaving the break but recovered to be close to the pace into the first turn, lost
position along the backstretch run while still near the front, steadied in tight quarters nearing the top of the lane and weakened in the stretch run.

J T'S WATCH assumed command of the early pace and set modest early fractions, extended the lead along the second turn, was confronted by NOWHERE
MAN nearing mid-stretch and was put to firm urging, repelled that foe into deep stretch and kicked away in the end. NOWHERE MAN saved ground into the
first turn while stalking the pace, advanced on the backstretch run, swung to the two path entering the drive, gained ground on J T'S WATCH in mid-stretch,
was turned away in deep stretch and was second best in the end. SUNNY SPOT was forwardly placed early on, lost ground two then three wide on the
second turn and was outkicked in the drive. CANYON CREST took back off of the early pace, came three wide into the backstretch run, gained ground
nearing the half-mile marker, ran evenly while three then four wide approaching the quarter pole, was outrun in upper stretch and lacked a late rally.

upper stretch, dueled with the runner-up to the wire and determinedly prevailed. MORE BUBBLY was sent to the early lead and established a clear margin
into the turn, drifted out a bit along the bend and came three wide into the drive, was headed by WHOA BUDDY in upper stretch, dueled through the lane
with that rival and was gamely bested, while well clear for second. ENGRAM was slow into stride early on, lost contact along the turn and was not a factor in
the stretch run.

Footnotes
TEE SHOT was sent to contest the early lead, dueled to the turn with OMAHA RUTSCH, shook free from that rival nearing the quarter marker, held foes at
bay through the lane and proved best in the final stages. AWKWARD MORNING was squeezed at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the pace
through the turn, advanced in upper stretch, finished well in the final furlong and could not reel in the winner late but was up in time to secure second.
INSTIGATE raced close to the early pace, lost ground four wide approaching the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, drifted out inside of the furlong
marker and was outfinished late while holding for third. TRIBUTE TO AFLEET broke alertly, chased the pace outside of rivals, came five wide to the quarter
marker, gained ground in upper stretch, avoided a drifting rival inside of the furlong marker, could not offer the needed late response but challenged late for
the minor awards. AMADMADWORLD chased the pace from the inside and lacked a late rally. OMAHA RUTSCH pressed the early pace, lost ground
nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. ROYAL HEART was squeezed at the start and was off a bit
slowly, lacked speed heading to the turn and was outrun in the stretch. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO INSTIGATE DRIFTING OUT IN
MID-STRETCH AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF
FINISH.

REFI NOW stalked the reasonable early pace, shifted off of the rail to go two wide nearing the quarter marker, was carried out by LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS
in upper stretch and came five to six wide in upper stretch, closed determinedly in the final furlong and kicked away in the end. LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS
was asked to show early speed and went to the front leaving the break, set the pace through the turn, drifted out at the head of the lane and came four to
five wide into the drive, was confronted by REFI NOW nearing the furlong marker, was overtaken by that rival nearing deep stretch and was outfinished,
while holding safely for second. SATANTA tracked the moderate early pace, ran evenly while three wide through the turn, gained ground while four wide in
upper stretch, was outkicked in the final furlong and was clear at the end for third. CONTINENTAL UNION tracked the early pace while outside of rivals, ran
evenly through the turn, gained ground while six to seven wide in upper stretch but could not sustain that run late and gave way in the final stages.

BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) settled just off of the early pace, saved all of the ground while maintaining position into the second turn, advanced nearing the
quarter marker, confronted U. S. DANGER in upper stretch, wore that foe down in the final stages and edged away late. U. S. DANGER was reluctant to
load, was sent to the early lead, was well rated through the backstretch run while setting solid fractions, was confronted by the winner leaving the second
turn, met that bid to mid-stretch and was overtaken in the final sixteenth, while holding safely for second. MEMO DADDY (CHI) lost his path leaving the start
and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early going while saving ground, mounted a four wide rally on the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was
outkicked by the top pair late, while holding safely for third. SEA OF LIBERTY was allowed to settle, saved all of the ground to the second turn, advanced in
upper stretch but did not offer the needed late response in the late stages. ROBIE raced close to the early pace, stalked the pacesetter through the
backstretch run, was steered three wide along the second turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker and weakened in the stretch run. UNION DANCE
bobbled at the start but recovered to be not far back in the early going, maintained position through the backstretch run, came five wide approaching the
quarter pole and gave way in the late stages.

Footnotes
UNION WAVE broke alertly and ceded the early lead, was a bit rank and steadied off of heels entering the first turn, attended to the solid pace through the
backstretch run, confronted the pacesetter while in hand nearing the quarter marker, overtook LEMON ZINGER in upper stretch and spurted to the lead in
mid-stretch, came under pressure in the final sixteenth, was all out late and gamely held on for the win. MOUNT PELLIAR was unhurried in the early stages,
saved ground through the backstretch run, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch run, closed willingly in the final sixteenth, confronted UNION WAVE in
the final strides and just missed for the win, while well clear of the rest for second. ARMA D'ORO hesitated at the start then was crowded leaving the break
and was off a step slowly, recovered to settle just off of the early pace, maintained position while saving ground into the second turn, came in tight along the
second turn, swung three wide into the drive, was outkicked in the final furlong but stayed on to be an easy third. LEMON ZINGER was sent to the early
lead, set solid fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted by UNION WAVE nearing the quarter marker and could not hold that foe off, dropped
back in upper stretch and tired in the late stages. WICKED BLUE stalked the solid early fractions while outside of rivals, maintained position through the
backstretch run, came five wide to the quarter marker and did not offer a late rally.
