WARP SPEED BABY set the pace along the rail and widened under a drive. FOLLOW Q T R prompted the winner two wide, was no match for that foe in
the lane but won the battle for the place. VOICE OF NOW stalked the pace three wide and was one-paced through the lane. FREDDY'S MUSIC tracked the
pace inside, made some progress at the rail in upper stretch then flattened out. POETIC CODE failed to menace while racing three wide. SILVER MATT
raced four wide and never threatened. CYNIC had his head turned at the start then hit the gate, was strung out five wide around the first turn, angled into
the two path entering the far turn and had no response. PAPA CHARLES was outrun while racing three and four wide. GHOST FIGHTER had brief speed
inside. SHIPWRECK steadied early, saved ground and made little impact. BROADWAY RUCKUS was outrun while racing four wide.

GET A GRIP MARILYN set the pace along the rail, drew off nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and widened while ridden out.
EXAGERADORA prompted the winner two wide, could not keep pace nearing the quarter pole but held for the place. COZY was reluctant to load, chased
the pace three wide and was along for the show. WICKLOW GAL steadied near the five-eighths marker, chased inside and lacked a closing bid. POETIC
UNION failed to menace while racing three wide. TWO BEER BUZZ had early speed between foes, steadied entering the turn and had no further response.
PRUSSIAN BLUE hesitated at the start and was always outrun while racing well off the rail. I LIKE VINO played no factor while racing four wide. ALWAYS
SUN was outrun inside.

Footnotes
JOURNEYMAN settled off the pace five wide, advanced five wide around the far turn, closed outside, put a head in front near the sixteenth pole, dueled to
the wire and narrowly prevailed. TELEPHONE TALKER stalked the pace in the four path around the first turn, bid in the three path around the far turn, took
the lead leaving the eighth pole, was collared nearing the sixteenth pole, fought on gamely inside and just missed. CASH CALL KITTEN raced off the pace
four wide, edged closer just inside of the winner while still in the four path around the far turn, was in a bit tight in upper stretch, rallied between foes,
steadied off heels near the sixteenth pole and recovered in time to gain the show. IMPRESSIVE SPEED raced in range three wide and lacked the needed
rally. PRINCE MAIOR set a rated pace in the two path and weakened leaving the eighth pole. TIMMY M. was in range while racing in the two path and
faded in the lane. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER OF CASH CALL KITTEN AGAINST TELEPHONE TALKER FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
ZYDECEAUX set the pace along the rail, drew clear around the turn, continued on the left lead through the stretch and widened under a drive. MAKIZAN
prompted the winner two wide, was no match for that foe but held on for the place. GRAND PICK saved ground in midpack and bested the rest.
CARABINERO steadied along inside down the backstretch, angled four wide entering the turn, chased outside and lacked the needed rally. MAJOR DEAL
failed to menace while racing three wide. ROCKLAND EXPRESS played no factor while racing four wide. FAST LIVIN steadied near the five-eighths
marker, saved ground and made little impact. ARMOR PIERCING steadied near the five-eighths pole, saved ground and never threatened. READY ON
THE LINE had only brief speed three wide. R K FLACO was outrun while racing two wide.

SMALL REASON broke a bit awkwardly, trailed inside down the backstretch, angled out entering the turn, advanced four wide around the bend, seized
command in midstretch and drew off under a drive. VERRAZANOINTHESKY settled off the pace inside, bid inside of foes in upper stretch, reached near
even terms in midstretch but was no match for the winner. DIRT ROAD DOLLARS was in range three wide, reached near even terms turning for home but
weakened while wandering about in the lane. ORIENTAL PARK failed to menace while racing three wide around the turn and angling widest in upper
stretch. AWESOME PUDDING chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. NEGLIGENCE was outrun inside. PACIFIC LEGEND never
threatened while racing two wide and appearing to try to lug in throughout. LAKI LIO sped clear soon after the start, set the pace in the two path and
retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
TIGRE settled off the early pace while racing four wide around the first turn, advanced inside around the far turn, angled back out in upper stretch, took over
leaving the eighth pole and drew clear under a drive. CACCIATORE vied inside of ENSIGN SKIP while racing in the two path, was bumped hard by that foe
in upper stretch, continued on the left, was no match for the winner in the final furlong but kept on to the hold second. ENSIGN SKIP set the pace in the
three path, dueled outside of CACCIATORE down most of the backstretch and around the far turn, lugged in and soundly bumped that foe in upper stretch,
continued on the left lead and weakened. LIGHTS OF BROADWAY saved ground off the early pace, advanced four wide around the far turn, lugged in in
upper stretch, continued on the left lead and lacked a rally. UNIVERSAL HERO played no factor while racing two wide. ANAMNESTIC failed to menace
while racing two wide. TIZADUKE stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. SHEA ON THE LAM was off slowly and made little impact
while racing four wide. DOC BALLARD broke a bit awkwardly and was outrun while racing two and three wide. COALMINER'S KITTEN trailed inside,
advanced three wide around the far turn, came six wide into the lane, bolted leaving the sixteenth pole, lost the rider, was caught by the outrider not long
after the finish and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN DEEP STRETCH AND TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
PUDDING stalked the pace two wide, tipped three wide near the quarter pole, steadily gained outside, put a head in front near the sixteenth pole and edged
ahead under a drive. GATSBY tracked the pace three wide, took the lead near the three-sixteenths pole, led to the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly
inside of the winner. MORGAN POINT saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and ran on for the show. SHIVAREE failed to menace while
racing four wide. KING CAB set the pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. ABSOLUTE GRIT stumbled at the start, had speed
between foes, steadied entering the turn and was through after a half. REAL TALK had brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
FRENCHMEN STREET was bumped at the start, settled off a four-ply duel in the duel while racing in the four and five paths, took aim widest in upper
stretch, closed determinedly, put a head in front near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. EARTH was reluctant to load, pressed the pace
four wide, took the lead leaving the eighth pole, led to the sixteenth pole and fought on inside of the winner. ASK FOR BODE raced off the pace two wide
and rallied through the lane to gain the show. POSEIDEN lacked speed inside, angled four wide near the quarter pole and rallied outside. SASSY BUT
SMART pressed the pace three wide between foes and weakened through the final furlong. ALLEGEDLY PERFECT dueled inside past the eighth pole and
tired. NO NAY MAYBE (IRE) was outrun inside. ZAMFIR bumped with the winner at the start, chased the pace five wide, angled into the two path
approaching the quarter pole and faded. VALID EXCHANGE was outrun inside. HENRY'S WORLD dueled two wide between foes and wilted in the lane.
LOUD N PROUD played no factor while racing two wide.
