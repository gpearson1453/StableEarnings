Footnotes
DIXIE RED hustled off to a big lead early would take a breather on the far turn reasserting control along the inside in upper stretch holding clear under a
vigorous hand ride. SMART PEGASUS raced evenly through the backside gaining on a geared down leader on the far turn being rebuffed by said foe in
upper stretch staying after it near mid track the final sixteenth keeping the winner honest late. LADY KIM raced evenly improving modestly on the far turn
lacking meaningful response down the lane. MIDNIGHT LEAP prompted throughout had no response dropping far back.

FEARNOUGHT pressured the pace moving abreast rival through the turn then down the stretch gradually winning out in the final yards. MACHEN'S RIDGE
bumped hard at the break quickly joined the pace pressing along the rail through the turn into upper stretch extending inside of rival there ceding the issue
grudgingly late. EXECUTIVE PRIZE raced evenly moving in the four path down the lane mustering a late response to pick up the others. ZERO FOR
CONDUCT raced evenly through the turn moving from the three path down the stretch lacking a late response. PRINCE LOUIS pinched back at the break
advanced wide on the turn flattening out from the eighth pole. STOLEN BIZ came in causing problems at the break, flashed early speed then gave way on
the turn.
