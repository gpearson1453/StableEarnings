Footnotes
REINE SECRET pressured the pace inside and raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, took the lead inside the eighth pole and dug in
determinedly to earn the nod. SAFE REEZAN set a pressured pace, contested the edge three wide on the turn, was met leaving the eighth pole and dug in
gamely through the lane, but missed the nod. TOY TIGER gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path and finished well while gaining on the top two.
LOOKIN BACK chased inside, angled out nearing the top of the lane, left the turn in the six path and passed rivals. WHYCANTTHISBELOVE chased,
rounded the turn off the rail, angled to the five path leaving the turn and showed little more. SUPER WILDCAT became a bit anxious in the gate then
pressured the pace, contested the turn between horses then weakened into the lane. WINDY GLO SAL stumbled leaving the gate and never factored.

TOLLER was hustled up and set a clear pace through the backstretch, rounded the turn at the rail and was steadily handled in the lane. GLASTONBURY
gave chase and raced close off the rail on the turn, dug in from the head of the stretch and held on for second. CHARGEITTOTHEGAME gave chase, raced
near the rail on the turn then dueled through the stretch to take third the final yards. PITCH DARK came away a bit rank and steadied through the chute,
picked up the chase from the half mile pole, rounded the turn in the four and five paths and ran evenly in the lane. PAPA DON chased and raced close in
the three path of the turn then flattened the final sixteenth. ACASHA'S INTUITION saved ground.

LOVE RAN RED stalked off the rail, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, reached
even terms into the stretch, dug in determinedly for the nod later yards and inched clear under the wire. DIAL ME MAYBE angled to the inside and rated the
pace, dug in to the challenge of Love Ran Red leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was met leaving the
turn and dug in gamely to later yards before relenting. MOONLIGHT MISS rounded the first turn about the three path, picked up the chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole but flattened in the three path of the far turn. COLOROFACLOUD settled off the pace two deep while between horses on the opening turn,
gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened at the rail on the far turn. WANTA BALLERINA settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the
chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little more. SUNDAY SWAGGER rounded the first turn about the three
path, left the turn outside and showed little response. MAGNIFICENT ROCKET raced off the pace inside, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole
then weakened at the rail into the far turn.

GABBYS BIG NOTION stalked two deep, challenged nearing the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead past the quarter, was kept alert to late stretch then
taken in hand the final yards. RIGHTEOUS MAN saved ground after being jostled early, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far
turn, dug in to take second the final yards and was gaining on the winner. UNIMPEACHED rated a short lead inside, dug in to the challenge of Gabbys Big
Notion leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was met by that one at the rail past the quarter, dropped back into the lane, flattened later yards and just lasted for
third. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE rounded the first turn about the four path then settled off the rail from the seven eighths pole, gave chase nearing the three
eighths, came through the far turn in the four path, finished well and just missed third. STEP OUT DANCING made light contact with Righteous Man shortly
after the start and rounded the first turn about the five path, settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths, came through the far turn in the three path but showed little more. THORN OF ROSE HILL made light contact with Righteous Man shortly after
the start then saved early ground, left the second turn outside and showed little response. BLUE COLLAR BOY saved ground just off the early pace, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened into the far turn.
