Footnotes
JAZZ MAN DO sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, responded when challenged by NO HUDDLE, re-cleared with a furlong to run
and held sway to the wire. NO HUDDLE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the half, vied with the winner but
could not match strides in the drive. GOBLIN chased the leaders while racing three-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. WILD FIREWATER
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. D C GUN RUNNER raced four-wide through the first turn while
being forwardly placed and gradually weakened. DUDE ROW lagged throughout.

MAJORWAYHOME raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the lane, responded when set down for the drive and wore down
the dueling leaders to be going away late. GO RED RASCAL was reserved just off the leaders early, advanced five-wide through the turn, could not gain on
the winner late but finished with good late energy. BYE BYE MATTY P disputed the pace from the inside with LIFE JACKET and gave way to the closers
through the final sixteenth. LIFE JACKET dueled for the lead with BYE BYE MATTY P while racing three-wide and also gave way through the final sixteenth.

BELLA DONA broke sharply to duel for the lead with TUTTA TERLINGUA while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the three-sixteenths pole
and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. BAND OF GLORY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out
nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good energy to gain the place. TUTTA TERLINGUA was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner
while racing three-wide, vied with that rival until the final furlong and gave way. MARKING TIME chased the leaders from the inside and gave way after
going a half. PROOFSINTHEPUDDIN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. DESTINY WHO showed no early speed,
saved ground through the turn, angled out into the lane and did not offer a bid. MARILYN MONEYROLL settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn and weakened.
