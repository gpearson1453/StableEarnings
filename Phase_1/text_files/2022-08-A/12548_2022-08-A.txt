Footnotes
LODE OF BLARNEY dueled inside of FIRECRACKER STAND for the early lead, shook free late on the turn, cleared two wide in upper stretch and
continued to pull away under a driving finish. COLD SNACK THIRTY chased along the rail around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and ran on to
finish clearly second best. APPLICANT was reserved racing in the back, saved ground then tipped two to three wide and captured show. PULL MY CHAIN
raced off the top two flights entering the turn, swung five wide into the lane and got edged for show. FIRECRACKER STAND dueled outside of LODE OF
BLARNEY in early stages, could not match strides late on the turn and faded in the lane. SOLDIER BOY was forwardly placed in early stages, chased three
wide in close contention at the quarter pole then faded in the lane.

LUCKYAPRIL vied between rivals into the turn, shook free entering the upper stretch, had plenty left in reserve, stayed sharp under a drive and finished
going away. HE'S A SHOWBOAT came away last then sat just off the embattled trio entering the turn, given cue three wide approaching upper stretch, ran
on through the lane and held place. BRAVO KOLT was ridden along four wide around the turn, sustained two to three wide bid in the lane and cleared the
rest. STAR OF MINE vied three deep in opening stages, battled on around the turn then came up empty in upper stretch. DAY MONEY lacked speed and
raced in the back, urged two wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. SOUTHERN SMOKE dueled inside of rivals through the backstretch and around
the turn then retreated.

MR. ANKENY sped to the lead at the start, led the way under pressure from MY BOY GUS around the turn, responded when called upon, widened to a
clear advantage in upper stretch and kept to task under steady urging. MY BOY GUS prompted the pace into the turn, sustained two to three wide bid
through the lane and just lasted for place. FINISH LINE tracked the pace around the turn then hustled along three wide in upper stretch, closed with
response and just missed place. JAMES'S MOONSHINE was reserved racing in the back, ridden along two to three wide in upper stretch and improved.
ITSALLABOUTYOU raced mid-range into the turn, coaxed three to four wide in upper stretch and ran on evenly. GOD'S PICK raced off the pace, saved
ground around the turn and lacked a rally. RUBIGINOUS raced off the early spec, swung wide into the lane and had no response. KILGORE raced in range
around the turn then came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
ANGEL'S MELODY cleared and crossed over soon after the start and showed the way up the backstretch, held firm around the far turn, came under a ride
at the head of the lane, battled on with a slim lead in the final furlong, dug in gamely, was all out and held on. KELA'S TURN settled in good position around
the first turn and stalked the leader through the backstretch, tipped out and came under a ride near the quarter pole, sustained bid into the lane, raced three
wide in aim for the late lead, dug in determinedly but could not get by. STONECOLD STUNNER was well reserved racing in the back, saved ground around
the far turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch, surged gamely to the wire and ran out of time. BOSSY MOMENT raced midpack through early stages, hustled
up two wide around the far turn, angled inside, raced in close contention and lacked closing response. SNAPY GAL steadied just after the start and raced
off the pace, came three to four wide into the lane and improved position without threatening. TAPTHATLUCK settled off the early pace, urged along the rail
around the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane, edged closer then faded in the final furlong. HELLO DARLING stalked the pace through the
backstretch, chased three wide around the far turn then faded in the lane. REBEL RISING tracked the early pace, flattened around the far turn and
continued to tire in the drive. TOPLESS failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
CYCLONE SORORITY raced three in contention entering the turn, edged closer then launched a bid for DELUSION at the head of the lane, poked a head
in front a furlong out then took charge and finished going away. DELUSION hustled up to the lead out of the gate, set a pressured pace over REMITTANCE
in early stages then edged away and held clear late on the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, got collared by the winner a furlong out but stayed on
with response and secured second best. FIREY EMBLEM raced off the early pace, hustled along three wide into the lane and gained a share. JITTERS
bumped with rival at the start, angled inside heading into the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, sustained inside bid then flattened in the final furlong.
FAST SOPHIA raced in the back, chased four wide around the turn, swung five wide into the lane and lacked rally. REMITTANCE SENT applied pace
pressure to DELUSION in early stages then weakened late on the turn and continued to tire in the drive. WUMPMUG showed brief response then retreated.
