quarter pole, closed willingly outside in the stretch run and ran past TWO MINUTES APART in deep stretch for the win. TWO MINUTES APART steadied
early on, then tracked close up on the inside, angled out midway on the far turn, rallied two wide into the stretch, took over, dug in gamely in the final
sixteenth and came up second best. ARTICO raced two wide off the pace, moved up at the quarter pole and rallied inside in the stretch run. EASY AS A. B.
C. stumbled at the start and bumped a rival, stalked two wide, chased the leaders on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside.
MO ANGELL stalked close up two wide, chased on the far turn and weakened in the lane. NETWORKING set the pace on the inside, showed the way into
the far turn, briefly shook free, dueled into the stretch and weakened. WORD FOR WORD was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside and did not
factor. BULLWHIP SKINNY was off slowly and outrun.

HENRYTHETHIRD raced off the pace inside, advanced under confident handling on the far turn, bid three wide at the quarter pole, quickly took charge,
cruised away from DESTINY JOY, marched home on his own and was geared down in deep stretch an easy winner. DESTINY JOY set the pace on the
inside, was pressed on the backside, dueled on the far turn and dug in gamely in the stretch run. SETTE STELLE raced three wide early, settled off the
pace, advanced at the quarter pole, came wide into the stretch and gained mildly. WHATA GUY stalked in the early stages, pressed the pace on the
backside, bid on the far turn and faded. DUBROVNIK tracked in the early stages, chased close up inside on the backstretch, then gave way. PRINCIPE
raced four wide early and was outrun.
