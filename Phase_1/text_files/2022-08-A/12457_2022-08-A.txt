Footnotes
EVANGELINA WHO stalked from the three path, took the lead from the five path into the stretch, and drew clear. CURL rated between rivals, saved ground
around the turn, bid from inside in midstretch, but hung late to place. POW WOW chased from the three path, swung six wide into the stretch, and improved
for show. N M SNOWBIRD rushed up to lead from the four path, was coaxed from the five path at the top of the lane, but faded. INDIAN AFFAIR raced in
midpack from the five path, was in the six path in upper stretch, but was one paced. SPACE GIRL raced from well back inside but was never competitive.
RUN FOR RANDY prompted the pace in the two path, was driven four wide into the stretch, but tired. ALSONO'S HUNTER was never a threat. RONA
CHROME was no factor. LOOKOUT FOR LANDRY steadied at the start and trailed throughout.
