FILM STAR set the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and drew away late in the stretch while geared down in the final stages. CHIRON pressed
the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run. STAND PROUD chased the pace early, was in the three path
into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. LAYTOWN tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. UNCLE
BERLEY raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and empty down the lane. BRIGHT SPARK was bumped and bothered at the start.
DOUBLE DEALER was never a factor. STAND FOR FREEDOM was never a threat. AUTOPOLIS was done early. EDGE OF GLORY was through after a
half. GRAND ASPEN was bumped and bothered at the start.
