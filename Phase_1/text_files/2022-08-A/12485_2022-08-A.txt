Footnotes
DIAMOND LYDIAMARIE pressed the dueling pair while three wide, was in a steady drive to duel for the lead on the turn, gained command in upper stretch
and held on under a strong hand drive. MAMA LOU chased the pace while two wide, was urging steadily on the turn to menace in the middle of the stretch
and was closing willingly. AIN'T SHE A PISTOL stalked the pace from the inside then dropped back slightly entering the turn, then menaced in early stretch
and was closing well. RISATA dueled for the lead while two wide, was in a hard drive, then took the lead at the top of the turn, was challenged by an outer
rival at the quarter pole, was used up and gave way in late stretch. WILD TAPIT was unhurried early, then bid five wide on the turn but came up evenly in
the stretch and was no threat. MOON OVER TUSCANY dueled for the lead from the inside, was hard used and weakened in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
CARBONITE chased the pace while two wide, was gaining ground steadily on the turn to menace in upper stretch, gained command and held on well to
prevail. CLOUD WITHOUT REIN set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive entering the lane but gave way in the end and was second best. FIRST
CROWNED stalked the pace from the two path, was in a steady drive into the turn then rallied in the stretch but it was not enough to catch the leader. C F V
BULLET chased the pace from the inside into the far turn then continued to bid even throughout the stretch drive. VINTAGE VINYL tracked the pace from
the inside, then bid mildly on the turn and came up evenly in the stretch. MY GRASS IS BLUE was unhurried early then bid two wide in the stretch but it was
too little too late and no threat. EAGLE FEATHER raced in the middle of the field while two wide then rallied on the turn and was no threat. RUNQUIETLY
was unhurried early, then continued to race at one pace into the turn and failed to menace in the stretch. MORNING MOTIVATION raced behind the field
while two wide, then faded entering the turn and was no factor. OLD CHESTER settled in the two path and was out run and never a factor.
