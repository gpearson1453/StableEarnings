Footnotes
LADY LIV leapt inwardly at the start, recovered quickly and sped to the front, set the pace in the two path, shook clear in upper stretch and held clear under
a drive. WHEELINGNDEALING tracked the pace four wide and finished willingly to narrow the gap. LOVE IS AWESOME broke well but lacked early speed,
advanced five wide around the turn, had the rider drop the whip near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and flattened out while trying to
lug in. SHE'S RED HOT chased the pace outside, angled down into the two path around the turn and lacked the needed rally. LITTLELADYISAWOMAN
was bumped at the start, saved ground and never threatened. INSATIABLE EVA broke inwardly and bumped LITTLELADYISAWOMAN at the start,
dropped far back inside and was never involved. GENUINE MISS pressed the winner three wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
EXTRA INDY was bumped soon after the start, saved ground off the pace, closed along the rail in the lane, reached near even terms nearing the sixteenth
pole and won the late duel. SHILOH steadied at the start, was bumped leaving the chute, raced off the pace five wide, bid outside of foes nearing the
sixteenth pole and was narrowly outkicked in a game try. NICE BABY stumbled and bumped BULLET VALENTINA at the start but was still quickly in front,
set the pace in the two path, led to the sixteenth pole and weakened between the top two finishers. MARVELOUS LADY prompted the pace three wide to
midstretch and faded. GRATIA threw her head at the start and broke a clear last, trailed in the four path for a half, angled widest in upper stretch and passed
tiring rivals. DORTH VADER stumbled badly then veered out at the start, came back in and bumped SHILOH leaving the chute, raced up close four wide
and came up empty in the lane. BULLET VALENTINA was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. TOO MUCH VINO was bumped soon
after the start, raced three wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
POSEIDON'S PASSION was in range while racing four wide, bid in upper stretch, took over leaving the eighth pole and dug in to repel late challenges on
both sides. THE GREAT KATH tracked the pace two wide, bid between foes leaving the eighth pole, angled to the rail near the sixteenth pole was unable to
reel in the winner. CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY settled off the pace, raced three wide around the turn, shifted further out in upper stretch and rallied for the
show. TREVESS chased the pace five wide and stayed on for a minor share. GITANA dueled two wide to midstretch and weakened. FRANKIE'S GIRL
broke outwardly and was steadied at the start, dropped well back inside, swung widest in upper stretch and never threatened. TRACY ANN'S LEGACY
prompted the pace three wide, was on near even terms between rivals turning for home and faded. NIKEE KAN dueled along the rail to midstretch and
faltered.

Footnotes
LONGING TO FLY set a pressured pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and drew off under a drive. MUDSHAFT broke well but was
soon shut off and clipped heels, dropped back, raced three wide around most of the turn then rallied between foes to gain the place. SOUTH PACIFIC
pressed the winner three wide and weakened in the lane. IRISH SAMURAI broke awkwardly, saved ground off the pace, was in tight in upper stretch and
never threatened. MISS HOLLY chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid. HAPPY'S NICE CANDY was in range two wide and tired through the
final furlong. NACHO SISTA was outrun while racing three wide. MY SONG AND MELODY broke sharply, was clipped behind soon after the start, prompted
the pace three wide, faded nearing the lane, ducked in leaving the eighth pole, lost the rider and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
