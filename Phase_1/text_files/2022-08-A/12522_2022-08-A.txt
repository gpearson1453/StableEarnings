Footnotes
FLAME MCGOON sped clear and crossed over to the inside, challenged by BAKER KAIT from outside in the stretch and responded to urging to hold
gamely. BAKER KAIT chased along the inside the tip to the outside of the leader on the turn, launched a bid in the lane but began to lug out, got
straightened out but failed to find the needed late kick. TECUMSEH CAROLINE in range four deep into the turn, stayed off the rail to the stretch, steered
inside the top pair and put in a late run to prove a game third. RYDER'S CANDY tracked widest up the backstretch, went five then four wide on the turn and
failed to threaten. SAPADILLA broke out and bumped rival, chased between foes into the turn, moved to the rail around the bend then moved out a bit
entering the stretch and weakened. LUCY L tossed her head, stumbled a bit and got bumped from inside, chased three deep into the turn, moved into the
two path and had the rider lose her whip past the five-sixteenths pole, stayed off the rail into the lane and lacked rally.

Footnotes
WOUND UP vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals to the turn, dueled with REXFORD around the turn and into the stretch, carried a short lead into the final
sixteenth and prevailed. REXFORD away quickly to establish the front, vied three deep to the turn, dueled outside WOUND UP around the bend and moved
into the two path, had the rider lose his whip with a furlong remaining and fought gamely to the wire under hand urging. STORMING MACHINE veered in
and bumped rival leaving the gate, sat off the pace outside rivals, coaxed three then four deep around the bend, closed in on the top pair and drew
alongside with a sixteenth remaining but could not get by. COLONEL VARGO stalked the speedy trio up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, three
deep at the quarter pole and lacked the needed response in the final furlong. BIG STICK got bumped repeatedly from outside in the beginning, settled off
the pace inside a pair of rivals, hugged the rail through the turn and could not rally. ZIO JO got knocked into inner rival leaving the gate, chased between
foes at the back then got crowded a bit at the half-mile pole, rounded the bend two then three wide and failed to menace. AUSPICE vied between rivals for
command early, could not keep pace with the top pair early on the turn, chased in the two path and then took hold briefly at the quarter pole, dropped back
between rivals and faded.

Footnotes
MERCY MERCY prompted the pace from outside early, went up to challenge between runners on the backstretch, fought through the far turn and three
wide into the stretch, took over and cleared in upper stretch and held well over the runner-up. A BROKEN BREEZE settled off the pace near the inside,
closed in around the far turn, angled outside the winner but finished evenly in deep stretch. PERFECT ICE STORM chased two to three wide on the first
turn, asked wide through the far turn and kept on to gain the show. FLAT OUT JOY took control early from inside, cleared briefly at the five-eighths pole, lost
command when challenged by a pair of rivals at the half-mile pole, fought back and regain the lead leaving the backstretch, maintained a slim advantage
around the far turn, relinquished command in upper stretch and flattened to fourth. STARSHIP DEFIANT raced up close three deep around the first turn,
moved up to take command at the half-mile pole, lost the advantage leaving the backstretch, fought with inner pair around the far turn, came four wide into
the stretch and weakened. CHROME OF OUR OWN was off slow to begin, went two to three wide around both turns and failed to menace. CREATIVE
ROMANCE broke out, chased four wide around the first turn, pressed four deep in the middle stages, lost ground on the far turn and came six wide into the
stretch and weakened. SUNNY LANE rank early on from inside, dropped back in the middle stages, eased on the far turn, pulled up at the top of the stretch
and walked off.

Footnotes
SMILING AT VAL broke out and bumped rival, went up to challenge for the lead from inside, dueled into and around the turn, put away outside rival with a
quarter mile remaining, met the bid from ARREST at the eighth pole, disposed of that rival in deep stretch and lasted over the runner-up. NO ICE CREAM
forwardly placed behind the top pair early, went three then four deep on the turn, bid from outside in the stretch and just missed. ARREST chased between
foes into the turn, waited for an opening around the bend, gained a clear path with a quarter mile left to run, bid outside the winner at the eighth pole but
faltered in the final sixteenth. SIPPIN N KISSIN stalked the pace from inside into and around the turn, followed the leaders through the lane and never could
gain a clear path. WHISKEY VISION sat off the pace well off the rail, came five wide into the drive and kept on to improve position. MAQAMAT got knocked
into rival at the start, raced along inside then tipped out midstretch and lacked a late bid. CARSON'S LEGACY got knocked into rival leaving the gate,
angled inward nearing the turn, steered out leaving the bend and could not rally. MONGOL SONG tracked outside rivals then chased in mid-pack, got
crowded between rivals past the three-eighths pole, entered the lane four wide and had little left for the stretch run. PRECEDENT away quickly to take the
lead, dueled outside the winner to the turn, lost contact at the quarter pole and gave way. MIDNIGHT METAL stalked from outside early on, dropped back
around the turn, exited the bend five wide and came up empty. MISSING MAURICE dropped back early, trailed into the turn, entered the lane three wide
and was outrun. TRICKY RICKY got bumped and lost his path at the start, came four wide into the stretch and never got involved.

Footnotes
DANIEL'S MAGIC got crowded a bit early and settled in a stalking position, waited for room on the inside behind the leaders on the turn and into the stretch,
tipped out in upper stretch and quickly took control past the eighth pole and held MYSUMMER DREAM at bay. MY SUMMER DREAM tracked three deep,
raced in a bit tight at the five-sixteenths pole, angled out and commenced a rally from outside but could not get by DANIEL'S MAGIC in deep stretch.
STREET ART dueled for the lead from inside, put away outside rival in upper stretch but as challenged again at the eighth pole, relinquished command
short after and flattened to third. KIMMER broke a step slow and dropped back early, saved ground around the turn, steered out in the lane and kept on to
earn a minor award. THUNDERHEART dueled for the lead from outside to the stretch and weakened. IRISH CIRCLES stalked up the backstretch, angled to
the rail on the turn and flattened in the drive. SANTOS TO WILSON broke out, settled widest up the backstretch, raced four wide then got forced out at the
quarter pole and could not rally in the lane. UNCLE WILBUR chased outside rival, went four wide into the turn, shifted out at the quarter pole and weakened.

Footnotes
DON'TTHINKJUSTDOIT bumped from inside at the start, went three wide into the clubhouse turn traveling near the back, moved closer in the middle
stages, waited for room behind a trio of rivals at the quarter pole, angled out at the three-sixteenths pole, surged to the front midstretch and powered away.
TANGLEDUPINGREY broke out and bumped rival, went up to taken the lead and moved inside, set all the pace to the lane, put to right-handed urging in
upper stretch, offered no resistance to the winner in midstretch but stayed on to secure the place. RECKLESS AFFAIR raced greenly along the inside early,
moved off the rail leaving the backstretch and went three then two wide on the far turn, altered out when WARRENS WORLD lugged out midstretch, then
finished willingly to gain the show. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY stalked the pacesetter on the inside, hugged the rail through the far turn, got through a tight
spot between a rival and the fence at the eighth pole but lacked the needed late kick. SYNTACTIC bumped both sides leaving the gate, unhurried in the two
path trailing into the first turn, angled out into the stretch, kept on through the final furlong but failed to threaten. HERECOMEGEORGIEBOY stalked outside
a rival or two wide around the clubhouse turn, went three deep into the far turn, remained three wide into the stretch and flattened. WARRENS WORLD
away quickly from outside then chased the leader two wide on the first turn, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, stayed two wide into the lane, lugged
out midstretch and weakened. THE BIG CHEESEOLA got knocked into outside rival in the beginning, unhurried in the two path early, saved ground around
the second bend and never got involved.
