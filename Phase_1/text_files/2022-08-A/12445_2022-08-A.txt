Footnotes
UNUSUAL MISCHIEF dueled with rivals three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, lost some ground and entered stretch third,
responded gamely to urging and inched away late. VIVIAN'S BOY dueled with pair of rivals along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the rail on
the turn, drifted out into the three path entering the stretch, and stayed on gamely to just miss. DAPPER away well and dueled in between rivals on the
backstretch, continued in tough in between position through the turn, floated out by inside rival into the four path in the lane, and kept on game to hold show.
ABADON broke out and bumped rival at the start, chased dueling trio on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, entered stretch along the inside and made
good late progress to just miss third. POLITICAL LOOPHOLE settled two wide on the backstretch, passed inside rival on the turn and went to rail, entered
stretch along the rail and failed to improve. JAY BOY settled well off the pace along the rail on the backstretch, continued along the rail on the turn, eased
out two wide into the stretch and just missed to finish fifth.
