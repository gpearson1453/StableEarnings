winner but bested the rest. WORTHINESS was off slow to begin, chased near the back, got put in a bit tight at the three-eighths pole and had to pause
briefly, tipped three wide into the stretch and kept on for a clear third. LIVING WITH AUTISM broke slow and bumped at the start, went three wide into the
turn then between foes, came four wide into the stretch and summoned a mild response. PRINCESS CATERINA raced up close then climbed a bit when
chasing behind rivals, traveled near the inside into the lane and could not rally. BOISTEROUSLY IRISH shifted in a bit at the start, vied between to the turn,
chased two then three wide around the bend and weakened. SQUARE FOOTAGE reared up in the gate and had to be reloaded, off alertly, shifted in and
bumped rival early, pressed between foes up the backstretch, chased three then four wide on the turn and weakened. NOISEY BURGLAR broke a step
slow then went up to vie from inside, could not keep up with the leader around the turn, saved ground to the stretch and weakened. ADELE DARLING

Footnotes
M IS FOR MAGIC in range off the rail early, bid four deep exiting the turn, took over in upper stretch and drove clear. CAUSE SHE'S A LADY bumped rival
at the start, stalked outside a rival, bid three deep past the quarter pole, steadied briefly in midstretch and stayed on for second. CRIMSON ROSE was off
slow to start, stalked up the backstretch inside a rival, launched a bid from the rail at the quarter pole, took over entering the stretch, lost command outside
the eighth pole and flattened to third. GIRL RANGER broke a step slow, raced in mid-pack well off the rail, got crowded a bit at the half-mile pole, angled
down to the two path, moved out in the stretch and failed to threaten while earning a minor award. MACHTENHAIRONFIRE sped clear and set the pace up
the backstretch, led two wide around the bend, challenged with a quarter mile left to run, gave up command entering the stretch, drifted to the inside and
weakened. WARREN'S QUEEN BEE sat off the pace and traveled along the inside into the turn, eased off the rail and went three to four wide into the
stretch and lacked further response. MOVINGLIKEAWINNER broke cleanly but lacked early speed, moved into the three path entering the turn, came back
out and left the bend six wide and failed to make an impact. CRAZY ABOUT YOU hit the gate and broke out, raced in mid-pack while wide in the early
going, navigated the turn four then five wide and failed to menace. SO IT WOULD SEEM stumbled a bit at the start and bumped leaving the gate, saved
ground through the turn and weakened. BLOSSOMING came away slow, rounded the bend three then four wide and never got involved.

three furlong left to run, headed rival past the quarter pole, took over at the top of the stretch, moved clear at the eighth pole but got outkicked by the top
pair. MUCINO stalked on the inside, tipped out but got hemmed in entering the stretch, moved back inside then tipped out and finished evenly.
ZOOKEEPER away quickly from outside, pulled while clearing and angled in, showed the way up the backstretch, met the bid from PARK CITY nearing the
three-eighths pole, held a short lead through the far turn, relinquished the lead at the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. CRYPTOHOLIC unhurried and
steered to the inside, pushed upon through the far turn, came out in upper stretch and improved position. CARRIZO SPRINGS traveled two wide outside a
rival near the back, angled in on the far turn and made no impact. CRYPTO MAN bumped leaving gate, pulled down along the inside early, tipped out and
brushed rival at the five-sixteenths pole then swung four wide and failed to menace. BLOCKED got forced in and bumped rival in the beginning, tracked
three wide out of range early, stayed off the rail into the stretch and weakened. ICE STORM got sandwiched between rivals at the start, pulled and steadied
off heels at the back nearing the first turn and was always outrun.

Footnotes
THORNE HOUSE broke in and bumped, went up to set the pace under pressure, cleared leaving the turn and held safely under urging. LEMON SUSHI
broke out a bit then stalked on the inside, roused with a quarter mile left to run and edged LEYAS CANDY for second. LEYAS CANDY got crowded between
rivals and steadied early, angled down to the inside to chase off the pace, tipped out and raced in traffic on the turn, angled three wide into the stretch,
brushed with rival at the top of the lane, finished well in the final furlong but got edged for second. AMERICAN CAT pressed the pace three deep then
outside the leader into the turn, lost contact late on the bend, brushed with LEYAS CANDY at the top of the stretch and weakened. MAGNIFICENT RIDE
hopped leaving the gate, advanced five then four wide around the tur but flattened out in late stages. GO LAKER GO raced in mid-pack outside rivals, asked
four to five wide around the bend and weakened. STANFORD NORTH stumbled leaving the gate, pressed between early then chased outside a rival past
the half-mile pole, three deep then two wide on the turn and weakened. DAD BOD bumped both sides leaving the gate, tracked between foes, ran three
then two wide on the turn and came up empty. CRIBBAGE BOARD bumped leaving the gate, chased off the rail, tugged up the backstretch and climbed a
bit, dropped back around the turn and tired.

Footnotes
CABO SPIRIT settled between early, took a back a bit to avoid being shuffled nearing the clubhouse turn, went two to three wide around that bend,
launched a bid four wide around the far turn, fought three deep in the late stages and proved best late. PERFECT FLIGHT broke a step slow, stalked on the
inside under a hold, moved closer in the middle stages, bid from inside entering the stretch, fought inside a pair of rivals through the final furlong and
finished gamely to the wire. SUMTER raced up close outside the pacesetter early, applied pressure on the backstretch, dueled around the far turn, took over
at the top of the lane, held a short lead to deep stretch and got outkicked by the top pair. ARMAGNAC away quickly from from inside and took control, set
the pace under pressure up the backstretch, dueled along the rail on the far turn then two wide into the stretch, got crowded a bit in upper stretch but was
already starting to weaken, drifted out through the lane and faded. STAYINCOTAI (IRE) was rank while trying to rate on the inside early on, moved off the
rail and traveled between rivals into and around the second bend, steered out in the stretch and weakened. BRIT'S WIT chased outside rivals leaving the
chute then began to pull first time through the stretch, traveled three deep around the far turn and into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
NOLONGERAHOBBY rated in the two path outside a rival, drew alongside the top pair past the half-mile pole, challenged three deep and took over at the
eighth pole and edged away. LIL NAS set the pace under pressure while moving inside, dueled around the far turn, fought with a pair of rivals in upper
stretch and stayed on gamely to the wire. DOC ADAMS tracked four deep around the first turn, went three to four wide on the second bend and put in a late
run for third. JOE DON LOONEY pressed the pace from outside, dueled around the far turn and into the stretch, then flattened to four in the late stages. IF
ID TOLD YOU was off a bit slow then had his path taken shortly after, became rank between rivals and got bumped into the first turn, got put in tight while
box in near the five-sixteenths pole, angled out to the four path, steered out widest in the lane but could not rally. SHOT OF A LIFETIME tossed his head
when rank early on, tracked two wide, moved inward in the stretch and failed to threaten. BRIX stalked the top pair from inside, entered the stretch two wide
and lacked a bid. SQUARE CAT pulled early, chased three deep, remained three wide into the stretch and could not rally. WORSE READ SANCHEZ raced
in tight between rivals and bumped into the 1st turn, steered to the inside settling near the back, lacked room when boxed in on the far turn, came two wide
into the stretch, angled in late and was never asked for his best. BUD KNIGHT was off slow and bumped with rival at the start, was a bit rank on the inside
early, saved ground to the stretch and failed to rally. BIG HAND was off slow and bumped in the beginning then checked between shortly after, trailed to the
far turn, angled out and came five wide into the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
TEDDY'S BARINO established the front quickly, took pressure on the backstretch, put away rival nearing the quarter pole, then drew away under hand
urging. KRISTI'S TIGER was rank briefly early, pulled around the first turn from off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and summoned a mild rally to
best the rest. TAYET was a bit fractious in the gate, raced up close four then three wide early, stalked outside the top pair in the middle stages, driven three
wide into the lane but flattened to third. TROUVILLE got shuffled between while three wide on the first turn, began to pull leaving the bend and pulled the
rider into range up the backstretch, chased four wide around the second bend and lacked a bid in the stretch. CINNAMON CAT fractious in the gate,
stumbled leaving, went three wide around the first turn near the back, advanced while angling five wide on the far turn and improved position. DREAM
PRINCESS climbed while chasing from inside early, continued to run awkwardly in the middle stages, moved out and went three wide into the drive and had
little left for the stretch. BICAMERAL forwardly placed off the rail, pressed the winner on the backstretch and far turn, lost contact at the quarter pole and
flattened out. MIDNIGHT JAMBOREE stumbled badly leaving the gate, trailed off the rail early, went two wide into the lane and was not a factor. QUEEN
OF THORNS brushed leaving the gate, chased between foes or in the two path and lacked a rally. TEN RINGS fractious in the gate, brushed QUEEN OF
THORNS in the beginning, raced in range from inside, dropped back under coaxing on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
ICONIC SKY came out leaving the gate, settled off the pace, angled in and gained on the turn, bid from the fence and got up at the wire. VA VA VOOM
chased on the inside then took aim two wide entering the stretch, bid three wide at the top of the lane and took over in upper stretch, resisted through the
final sixteenth but got nailed on the line. LADY MARYANN chased three deep early, four wide into the lane, rallied outside the top pair but was not enough.
D'S LOVELY SOPHIA sat off the pace off the inside then angled in on the turn, lacked room in upper stretch, altered out past the eighth pole and finished
gamely. ESSENTIAL BUSINESS raced near the back early on, angled to the rail on the turn, came out in the stretch and summoned a late rally. DANCING
DANA broke a step slow, chased inside then had to check at the three-eighths pole, tipped out into the stretch and improved position. KITTEN'S KID was off
slow and lost her path at the start, ran up on heels nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, tipped three wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and
could not rally. BIG TREAT traveled widest early near the back, exited the bend four wide and made no impact. MISS O'BRIEN stumbled leaving the gate,
shifted out early, chased between rivals, three to four wide on the turn and failed to respond. HER PERFECT VISION sped clear and opened up a
comfortable lead, led a bit off the rail into the stretch, lost command in upper stretch, shifted out past the eighth pole and weakened.

outside the leader, put away ELECTRIC LETTUCE in upper stretch and remained clear to the wire. CHEDDA CASH chased the lone leader from between
rivals, angled to the rail for the turn, saved ground to the stretch, could not summon the needed late kick but stayed on to secure second. SELL THE
DREAM settled off the pace, went four wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and closed with a mild rally to earn the show honors. E Z PHARIS
tossed his head and broke out, tracked four deep entering the turn, exited the bend five wide and needed to find more in the furlong grounds. ELECTRIC
LETTUCE sped clear and set the pace off the rail, led two to three wide around the bend, lost command into the stretch and weakened. FUMANO'S GIRL
bumped and got shuffled leaving the gate, dropped back early, raced two wide around the bend then angled in and failed to menace. PADDLE ON POLLY
chased three deep into the turn, continued three wide into the lane and weakened. SMILING LADY chased from inside but raced greenly up the backstretch,
steadied at the seven-sixteenths pole, continued a bit green around the turn and tired.

Footnotes
VIA EGNATIA away quickly from outside and went to the front, angled over to the rail on the clubhouse turn, set all the pace to the stretch, remained clear
into the final sixteenth and held gamely. ALVAARO stalked from inside, tipped three wide past the quarter pole, finished well through the lane and kept
gaining to the wire. TARTINI threw his head and came away slow in the beginning, went up into a tight spot and steadied between rivals early, tracked
between foes then angled to the inside, steered out on the far turn and came four wide into the stretch, closed through the lane and finished a game third.
BACK RING LUCK prominent early then ceded command to VIE EGNATIA, was closest in pursuit to the far turn, took aim in the two path entering the
stretch but finished evenly in the late stages. DILIGENT raced three deep well off the pace, angled in and saved ground on the far turn and needed to find
more in the final furlong. MOVE OVER (GB) broke a bit slow from outside, reserved in the early going, traveled outside a rival or in the two path to the
stretch, improved position late but failed to threaten. HOLY GHOST allowed to settle on the inside at the back, tipped two to three wide on the far turn and
could not make an impact on the major placings. EAST RAND traveled three then two wide on the first turn, went three deep into the second bend, exited
that turn four wide and could not offer the needed response. KITTEN'S SPA tucked inside on the first turn near the back, moved out and went between foes
on the backstretch, steered back to the inside on the second bend and failed to menace. ASARO settled in the two path, moved out a bit and came three
wide into the stretch and never responded to urging. PORT O' CALL chased on the inside near the back, coaxed along in the middle stages, started to
weaken leaving the backstretch, dropped back around the bend and tired.
