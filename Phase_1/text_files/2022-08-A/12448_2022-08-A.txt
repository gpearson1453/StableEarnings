Footnotes
PRICE TALK stalked a loose leader while saving ground through the backside engaging outside the quarter pole clearing at the head of the lane in the three
path dropping to the rail inside the eighth pole being hand ridden to wire. SOUND OFF dropped far back early beginning to respond outside the quarter pole
losing ground coming eight wide in upper stretch running past a weary bunch to salvage place. ANANROAD hustled off on the opening turn moved a brisk
pace on a large lead through the backside, collared outside the quarter pole was dispatched by the winner in upper stretch racing leg weary the final
sixteenth managing to hold off most. SHY GUY slow early lagged through the far turn moving from mid track down the lane passing weary rivals there.
HIGH ROLLING DUDE raced evenly throughout lacking more. MORE THAN GOOD gave a mild middle move pursuing on the far turn wearing out in the
four path upper stretch. DRIFTWOOD chased the pace through the backside then folded abruptly on the far turn. MIDNIGHT TEA TIME had lost action
when pulled up at the head of the stretch walking off after the race.

COMMAND STRIKE pressed a narrow lead through the turn shaking off inside pressure to clear in upper stretch drawing out late under a drive in the three
path. DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT pressed early then chased along the inside to upper stretch proving no match for the winner there holding under outside
pressure to save place. LIAM'S LIGHT hustled in pursuit through the turn extended in the four path down the stretch dueling outside of foe for place hanging
late. WE MISS SUSIE crowded off the rail early would angle back inside to upper stretch vying all out late coming up a bit short. MALICED raced evenly
through the turn coming eight wide in upper stretch having some action to vie for minors there. THUNDERING CREED was always a step slow. KAELY'S
SISTER carried in to the rail early angled out brushing rival near the seven sixteenths pole chasing on the turn fading to upper stretch. PULPIT'S
PURRFECT angling in early was carried out and brushed near the seven sixteenths pole.

HOLLIS chased evenly through the turn looming outside dueling rivals in upper stretch, had rallied past three deep when rider lost his whip yards from the
wire. FULLY CONNECTED chased the pace drawing even abreast foe in upper stretch before being overpowered from the outside holding well as second
best. STORM BOARDER (CHI) sent clear on the turn was hooked along the inside in upper stretch dueling to mid stretch gradually wearing down late.
WILD BEHAVIOR raced evenly through the turn lacking more down the stretch while holding position. BYBEE slow early played no factor. SHOW ME THE
BEST was never involved. GOLDEN G was always outrun. BAYTOWN WARRIOR veered out brushing the gate at the break.

ADVENTURING stalked the pace along the inside rallying to wrest a clear lead at the three eighths pole digging in from the two path in upper stretch drifting
out toward mid track despite right hand urging late holding rivals safe. LASHARA (GB) advanced on the backside threatening through the far turn, began to
drift into upper stretch ending up closer to the apron then the rail finding enough late to salvage place. SHE'S PURE SILVER slow early rallied to contention
on the far turn chasing into upper stretch angling out when the leader drifted late needing a bit more at the end. PRINCESS NINA gave a mild middle move
racing evenly through the stretch as no threat while best of others. LOOPY sent hard hustled off to an early lead being reeled in on the backside folding
rapidly on the far turn. COUNTRY CHICK was always outrun. OUT ONA LIMB outrun early would tire. KITTEN BY THE SEA gave way on the backside.

FULSOME well rated through the backside would angle out near the three eighths pole bidding four deep at the quarter pole taking a short lead in upper
stretch angling in to meet the challenge of rival being put in a touch close late having enough to win clear. DERBY HOUSE went evenly through the turn
surging four wide to put a head in front near the quarter pole being headed in upper stretch extending on the inside of foe from the eighth pole coming out a
bit under left hand urging to be in close late ceding the issue in the closing yards. SILVER PROSPECTOR slow early surged between horses to threaten on
the far turn coming four wide in upper stretch angling in a bit losing momentum late giving an even finish. PERFECT SENSE checked off heels on the first
turn, lagging after swung out on the far turn coming seven wide in upper stretch moving up a few spots there. SO DIALED IN stalked the early pace being
shuffled back on the far turn racing five and six wide down the stretch. ENDORSED tracked the pace pressing in bid along the inside on the far turn
wavering in upper stretch fading from contention while angling out there. LIKEABLE sent clear set the pace through the backside then was engulfed on the
far turn. IRISH UNITY stalked close up through the backside pressing in bid on the far turn wearing out abruptly to upper stretch. THE STEWARDS

Footnotes
SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING benefitted from traffic at the break to be forwardly placed stalking to the far turn engaging there wresting a short lead abreast rival
in upper stretch edging clear in the final yards. WE THE PEOPLE sent clear chose to rate the pace posting soft splits through the backside being hooked on
the far turn extending on the inside of rival down the stretch ceding the issue late. SIMPLIFICATION in close at the break stalked close up through the
backside chasing on the far turn wavering in upper stretch racing evenly the final eighth in the four path. HOME BREW squeezed back at the break raced
evenly through the backside losing ground to rivals on the far turn finishing evenly to best the others. KING OTTOMAN squeezed back at the break gave a
prompted middle move chasing on the far turn wearing out in upper stretch. COURVOISIER veered in jamming rivals at the break, tracked evenly through
the backside then gave way on the far turn. JR'S GIFT veered out leaving the gate, would trail throughout.

PRINCE AMADEUS broke sharply edging away on pace through the turn digging in from the three path down the lane becoming leg weary late hanging on
to inside pressure at the wire. TRIGZ TOO slow early began to respond mid turn saving ground to upper stretch vying from the rail surging to just miss at the
wire. THE BEST DISTANCE gave a mild rally on the turn bidding four wide down the lane closing on a tiring leader late. RYEGATE STONE chased through
the turn weakening in upper stretch finishing evenly. DESERT COWBOY flashed early speed the faded on the turn. MY SUGAR TOWN was always outrun.
