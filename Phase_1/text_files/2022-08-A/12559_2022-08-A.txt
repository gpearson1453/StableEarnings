Footnotes
WAR GIANT trailed the field from the middle of the track, angled in driving between foes in the far turn, swung four to five wide into the lane, was under
handling through the stretch and was up in the final strides finishing in record time. SIR BREGOVIC vied inside leaving the chute, held a slim advantage
approaching the far turn over INTENT TO STRIKE, disposed to the fore mentioned into the lane and was caught late. LINCHPIN STORM rated off the pace
from the three path, asked to quicken nearing the quarter pole, lodged a rail bid and improved position into the stretch. INTENT TO STRIKE broke alertly
then sat just off the pace, was unable to move on with rival and faded. SEBASTIAN'S BOY settled outside in the six path, and lacked a serious bid.

wide, was no match for the winner in the stretch and finished willingly for place. MIDNITE CHILL stalked the pace through the backstretch, chased through

SAVED BY ZERO contested the pace from a rail position, dueled in the final turn inside of STORMCHASER, kicked clear into the stretch and held safely.
MAJESTIC CAFE sat in range from the five path, closed steadily through the stretch but needed more late. DREADNAUGHT trailed outside, closed well late
and missed. STORMCHASER set a pressured pace, dueled outside of SAVED BY ZERO, was unable to move on at the three sixteenth marker with rival
and flattened. BURNING LOVE attended the pace in the three path, and lacked a closing response. JULIUS THE GREAT pressed four wide, and failed to
menace.

EXACTLY tracked inside, angled four wide off the final turn, struck the front into the stretch and was kept to task under light handling late. ORANGE
THEORY fanned five wide into the opening turn, sat just off the pacesetters in the three path, drove three wide into the lane, and lacked the kick needed.
SHIP'S CREEK hustled away, contested the early pace from the rail, dueled inside of LIGHT FAST FEET in the final turn, and lacked the rally needed in the
drive. LIGHT FAST FEET set a pressured pace, dueled between foes in the final turn, and came up empty for the drive. FLAT AS A PANCAKE tracked four
wide in the opening turn, and faded steadily. DAZZLING CHIC was never far back settling in the five path, and was done early.

Footnotes
LUCKY HALO broke alertly, stayed out front while racing along the inside, rider peered over right shoulder at the head of the stretch then geared down and
narrowly held under a late closing WILD RUNNIN MAGGIE along the inside rail. WILD RUNNIN MAGGIE allowed to settle inside, took closer order nearing
the stretch, launched an all out rail bid and narrowly missed after a game effort. BEAUTIFUL CALL trailed early, came under right handed urging into the
stretch, closed gradually outside and got by late for show. DRAGON WING advanced outside in the final turn, angled inward nearing the three sixteenth
pole, and was rundown late. BAKED N WIRED lacked running room along the rail at the three eighths marker, shifted out to the four path at the head of the
lane, and bid belatedly. SAKKARY chased outside and failed to threaten. GHOSTLY RUNNER chased the pace early and gave way into the stretch.

MUDINATOR bumped away from the gate, contested the pace from the three path, gained the lead head of the lane, and drew off through the stretch. KISS
ME HELLO vied hard outside, fanned three wide through the far turn, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and finished second best. NO MORE
JO KING rated off the pace, was given cue near the quarter pole, closed gradually outside and got up late for show. LILLY'S OF LONDON hustled inside,
exchanged bumps at the top of the lane outside of BIG BAD INTAGLIO, lugged in through the stretch while matching strides with inside foe and was edged
out late. BIG BAD INTAGLIO broke out into MUDINATOR, sped to the front, was outsprinted through the turn, exchanged bumps entering the lane then
dueled through the stretch inside of LILLY'S OF LONDON, and weakened deep stretch. OUR SUNSHINE broke out sharply to trail the field, and passed
tiring foe late. SHOO BABY chased outside and tired. **STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Board of Stewards conducted an inquiry at the top of the lane involving
BIG BAD INTAGLIO and LILLY'S OF LONDON but made no change after reviewing the film.

SUDDENLY MISTY stalked from the five path, dropped back leaving the backstretch, rallied determinedly along the rail, angled out driving between foes,
and prevailed under a drive. QUEEN RHONDA trailed the field, fanned four wide leaving the backstretch, rallied outside through the stretch, and was out
finished. MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER emerged the leader leaving the chute, led the way then drifted in off the final turn, and was rundown late. LITTLE
HARPER tracked from the three path, rallied five wide into the stretch, and evened out. SASSY BUT CLASSY raced widest into the backstretch, chased five
wide, angled in entering the stretch and passed tiring. QUICK DIAL tracked inside, roused at the quarter pole, and lacked a closing response. WINE
TASTER chased outside leaving the chute, sat just off the pace while three wide, and had nothing left in reserve late. MIDNIGHT TAKE raced near the back
of the pack, and lacked a bid. IM A WHISKY GAL tracked inside and was done early.
