Footnotes
FLAG TO FLAG was away quickly, then was challenged by an outer rival to duel for the lead into the stretch drive, was in a hard drive to menace grudgingly
in the final furlong, bumped the dueling contender slightly and was up at the wire. LILY'S HOME rushed to the lead in the first furlong to duel for the lead
while two wide into the turn then continued to rally gamely in the stretch, was bumped slightly in the final furlong and missed in the end. MAGIC BEAUTY
chased the pace while three wide then rallied in upper stretch but came up evenly in the end. HOLIDAY NECKLACE raced behind the field while four wide,
then made a mild bid in the stretch and was no threat. ONE MORE SISTER chased the leaders from the inside then bid on the turn but flattened out in the
lane. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY and JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following the race. The jockey of LILY'S HOME claimed foul against the jockey of
FLAG TO FLAG for interference in the late stretch. After reviewing the replay, no change was made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
ANAITA set the pace from the two path from the outset, cleared into the turn, continued clear into the lane, was encouraged mildly after straightening then
continued to widen to the wire while being ridden out. IDAREYOUTODANCE chased the pace from the four path through the turn and into the lane, was no
match for the winner in the final eighth but stayed on to last for the place spot. LIZZSAIDNO tracked the pace while along the inside through the turn and
into the lane, was asked for more after straightening in the lane, could not gain on the top one but was closing in on the place spot.
UNFORGETABLENATALY was close up early to press the pace then slowly lost contact with the top ones. GIODORABLE was never a factor while in the
two path throughout. ADDEMUPJUSTICE clipped heels before the first call when drifting out a bit, stumbled badly, lost rider then continued on while trailing
the field and was eventually walked off.

Footnotes
MINTCHOCOLATECHIP lead the way from the inside into the far turn, vied for lead, was headed shortly by an outer rival mid stretch, then continued to dig
in grudgingly to duel with a rival from the inside in the final furlong and was up at the wire to prevail. TELLMEONASUNDAY chased the leader from the
inside into the second turn, then rallied in upper stretch, dueled with the pace setter in late stretch but missed in the end. JUDY'S WAY tracked the pace
while two wide on the backstretch, was urging steadily on the far turn to rally gamely in early stretch, was a nose in front at the eighth pole, was used up and
flattened out in the end. GRACE'S SECRET was unhurried early then bid four wide on the far turn to rally in the stretch but it was too little too late.
FIRESIDE KITTEN chased the pace while three wide, was in a steady drive to rally four wide in the stretch but flattened out in the end. CANARY stalked the
pace while two wide into the backstretch then faded entering the far turn and never menaced in the stretch.

Footnotes
HOT RUMOR set the early pace while under pressure, continued with close company into the far turn, shook clear in late turn, widened to the eighth pole
and was all out to last. MEJTHAAM saved ground into the far turn when never far back, moved off the rail to chase the winner into the lane, bid from the two
path, looked beaten approaching the sixteenth pole, stayed on well and was closing in to the wire and just ran out of real estate. LADY TERRA was
reluctant to load, came out a step slow and was slow to gather while swishing her tail about, advanced along the rail into the far turn, continued momentum
into the lane then flattened inside the eighth pole while finishing clear for the show spot. SHEZAPISTOL was forwardly placed while in the four path through
the turns, came into the lane from the five path and lost ground through the final eighth. SOUTH GEORGIA saved ground through the far turn when near the
back then tired through the lane. FAITH'S REWARD broke to the outside, raced through the four path on the first turn, continued well off the rail while
advancing into a menacing position through mid-turn then was empty entering the lane while in the six path. BIKINI pressed the winner while two wide and
in the three path into the far turn then was done after mid-turn.

Footnotes
SECRET SADIE chased the pace from the three path through the turn, moved closer in late turn, swung into the lane from the three path with aim on the
leader, collared that one outside the eighth pole, gained a short lead and gamely held while challengers closed in. BUOY was bumped and shut off at the
start, raced in the three path through the turn when inching up, angled into the four or five path into the lane and steadily closed ground to the wire. QUICK
AND EASY was in the two path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the three path, was gaining momentum inside the sixteenth
pole when shifting in to find a hole and was inching up to the end. MORE APPROVAL stumbled outward at the start bumping with outside rival, hustled up
along the inside through the turn, continued along the rail into the lane and stayed on well to be a part of the place photo. FLIRTY DANCER set the pace
from the outset while near the inside, cleared in mid-turn, was caught outside the eighth pole then faltered late. C J'S EMPIRE was bumped at the start,
raced in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and never was a factor. ANNA'S TRIBUTE was bumped and forced out
at the start, hustled up to stalk the leader through the turn then faded after entering the lane. GIVEUSTHISDAY was never a menace while in the three or
four path through the turn. GOT SPIRIT was bumped, put in tight and checked at the start, dropping back about four lengths, trailed into the lane and raced
in the eight path while hopelessly beaten.

LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE showed the way while two wide into the first turn, was in a long drive, cleared the second turn and was in a mild drive to the end
proving best. ON A TOUR raced from the inside, was saving ground on the backstretch to menace in early stretch and closed well to be up for second
place. SENTIMENTALJOURNEY chased the pace from the inside, was in a steady drive to make a gamely bid entering the home stretch but gave way for
place in the end. INCESSANT raced in the middle of the field while two wide, was steady urging on the turn to rally in upper stretch but came up evenly.
SECOND EXCHANGE stumbled at the start then settled along along the inside into the far turn, made a mild bid in the stretch and was no threat. LAUNCH
AWAY settled in the two path, was in a hard drive on the far turn to rally in early stretch and was no menace. SMACK chased the leader while in the three
path then faded entering the far turn and failed to rally.

Footnotes
LOVE DRUNK vied for the early lead along the inside, lost the lead in late turn, re-fired into the lane, cleared before the eighth pole and extended to the
wire. EXPRESS LADY vied for the lead two wide through the turn, led into the lane, was no match for the winner through the final eighth but kept on to be
second best. Z'S LUCKY GIRL chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path, had aim on the top ones
straightening into the lane and could not gain while finishing clear for the show spot. HOOSIER PREMIUM saved ground into the lane when never far back
then lacked a closing response. SWEEPINJUSTICE was never a threat while racing in the four path through the turn. BOTOX KATIE was close early while
between rivals, shuffled to the back as rider looked about then re-engaged through the lane. AMERICA RULES raced in the three path through the turn
while in mid-pack then tired. NOT A ROLE MODEL stepped in at the start, angled to the rail into the turn and was never a factor. MAKE OVER was in the
four to five path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and never was in it. BREAKUP WITH TITOS pressed the pace from the two path
early then steadily faded.

Footnotes
FRIENDLYPERSUASION was forwardly placed while two wide into the first turn, was in a steady drive on the backstretch, then menaced on the far turn,
gained command at the eighth pole and drew clear under a strong hand drive. TIMELY SECRET set the pace while two wide, was in a long drive entering
the final furlongs but gave way in the end. I'MHEREFORTHEPARTY tracked the pace while two wide, then was moving up to rally three wide in the stretch
but was no threat. RUN AND GUN chased the pace from the inside then bid on the far turn but never fired in the stretch. BOUDICA chased the pace while
three wide into the far turn to menace in the stretch but was no threat. ADDICTED TO LOVE chased the pace in the four path, then rallied entering the far
turn but had no final bid and was no factor.
