SNAP AWAY vied inside of SLUSHY for the lead into the turn, shook free leaving the quarter pole, widened advantage in upper stretch and kept to task
under a mild drive. SLUSHY dueled outside of the winner into the turn, failed to match strides past the quarter pole, stayed on with response into the lane
and finisihed second best. UNHERDOF chased the duel in early stages, hustled along two wide then urged inside through the lane and cleared the rest.
FIVE ROSES LUNA was ridden along four wide around the turn, came five wide into the lane and improved position without threatening. TA chased two
wide between foes in the second flight three furlongs from home, flattened mid-way around the turn and offered no late bid. HATCHET GURL raced in
contention three deep into the turn and came up empty entering the lane.

MEGATAP dueled around the first turn and continued to battle inside of BILLY YANK through the backstretch and around the final turn, shook free at the
head of the lane, stayed sharp under pressure and finished going away. BILLY YANK dueled outside of MEGATAP into the first turn, continued to battle for
command around the final turn, could not kick on with the winner at the head of the lane and held place late. GHOST STRATEGY tracked the pace in close
range, hustled up along the inside around the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane, shifted out three to four wide approaching the furlong marker and
prevailed for a share. SCREENPLAY raced in contention through the backstretch, chased two wide between foes around the far turn, ran on four wide
through the lane and just missed show. KWAI CHANG was off a step awkwardly and came away slow at the start, quickly recovered and advanced into a
forward position leaving the first turn, prompted the top pair three wide to the far turn, vied three deep past the quarter pole then came up empty in upper
stretch. BRODY BOUCHER rated off the early pace, given cue three wide at the three eighths pole, failed to advance around the far turn then steadily
retreated.

I THINK I KNOW YOU tracked the embattled duo in early stages, launched a three wide bid around the turn, steadily edged up closer then reached
ADDABABY for the lead near mid-stretch, dug in gamely under firm handling and edged away. ADDABABY dueled inside of KAYLOR for the early lead and
matched strides around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, briefly fought back when confronted the winner then got overtaken and settled for
second best. KAYLOR dueled outside of ADDABABY for the early lead, could not match strides at the head of the lane but ran on for a share. GOTTA
HAVE FAITH hustled along the inside into the turn, came two wide into upper stretch and needed more for late impact. HEY NELLIE raced off the early
pace, saved ground into the lane and lacked a rally. CAN'T MAKE ME raced three wide around the turn and never threatened. RUDY TOOTY was outrun
racing three wide.

Footnotes
TIME GOES ON was forwardly placed around the first turn and prompted the pace through the backstretch, vied with MR SOLO around the far turn, shook
free at the head of the lane then took on the challenge from SIR WALLY WALLY, held a slight edge, dug in gamely under firm handling and refused to let
rival by. SIR WALLY WALLY stalked the pace through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid at the quarter pole, roused forward to challenge TIME
GOES ON for the lead in upper stretch, dueled gamely but failed to get by and finished clearly second best. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY raced in the last flight,
hustled along two to three wide around the far turn, sustained bid into the lane and secured a share. YOU TALKIN TO ME was unhurried and raced in the
last flight, swung five wide into the lane and improved position. JOHN R rated off the early pace, picked up the tempo four wide midway around the far turn,
briefly gained closer contention then gave way. MR. SOLO set a pressured pace through the backstretch, vied with the winner around the far turn then tired
in the drive. MINECRAFT MANIAC tracked the pace four wide through the backstretch then came up empty late on the far turn.

Footnotes
CONFETTI BETTY sped to the lead at the start, held firm around the turn, roused for more in upper stretch, responded willingly and drew off. REDNECKER
was forwardly placed and chased the eventual winner around the turn, ran on two to three wide into the lane and dug in late to hold place. STREAKIN'
EASY was ridden along three wide around the turn, sustained bid into the lane and just missed place. DELIGHT SURPRISE saved ground around the turn
and failed to threaten. PENNY EXPRESS raced off the early pace, chased three wide around the turn and had no response. ADIOS OKOBOJI lacked speed
and raced in the back, came four to five wide into the lane and had no response. RUTHIE RULES showed response in early stages then came up empty.
