Footnotes
HALF OURS N STORMY broke on top, set or forced the pace for three furlongs along the inside, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home,
steadily increased advantage while kept to task with a brisk hand ride. PAPA BRO slight bother start, raced behind the first flight while racing off the inside,
dropped to the inside to improve position into the lane, proved no match for the winner, edging clear for the place late. FAREWELL TIME broke with the
winner, alternated up front with that one in the two path and between horses, fell back a bit turning for home, chased that same rival past the furlong marker,
also proved no match, caught for the place. LOUISIANA HERO broke out and back to bother the runner up slightly, trailed early as a result, came three wide
for the drive, lacked a serious rally. LAUGHINGSAINTSSONG pressed the issue up front in the three path before beginning to weaken late in the turn.
CHASIN GRACIE finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
LES AND MADGE settled off the pace and the inside, raced three to four wide out of the turn, set down, closed with good resolve and mounted a late push
to be up in time while remaining outside. PENNIE'S MAGIC tracked the early pace inside, continued to save ground through the turn, asked along into the
lane, rallied up the rail to annex the place. CHICKIETOWN STAR set the early pace, shook clear in the turn, continued to lead by daylight past the furlong
marker, offered little resistance to the winner late, allowed the runner up the inside in the final strides to lose the place. SOUVENIR CHANNEL underwent a
shoe repair in the paddock, void of speed in trailing early, staged a mild rally to improve position without posing a serious threat, unseated rider pulling up.
GRACE'S VISION forwardly placed in the early going outside, began a steady retreat before three furlongs. ST JOAN prompted the early pace, chased the
leader through the turn then gave way in the drive. GOODBYE ROSIE dwelt start, remained always back.

Footnotes
GETCHA in the second flight through the first turn three wide, advanced and challenged outside the early pacesetter to that one's outside, dueled far turn,
shook clear when straightened for home, kicked clear under steady handling. NOW YOU RULES in the second flight inside, continued to save ground
second turn before encountering some traffic late in that bend, switched out to be three wide for the drive, closed with good determination to be in time for
the second spot. CALLTHEWOLFE within striking distance, asked along three wide late in the final turn, closest to the winner a furlong out, could do little
with that one to the wire, caught late for the place. TIN DELAY void of early foot off the inside, four wide when improving into the lane, flattened out the final
furlong to finish up evenly. WE NEED A FIVE remained back in failing to rally. CARIBE NIGHTS sprinted clear through the first turn, dueled into the far turn
inside the winner, gave way midway on that bend. CYBER GUN last to leave, was finished before a half, well back.

Footnotes
COPPER MOON moved up inside to take over into the turn, larger lead three furlongs out, shrugged off a rival entering the stretch, remained clear to the
wire under intermittent urging. FOR HARPER off a step slow, lacked speed while inside, continued saving ground into the lane, rallied up the rail to finish
willingly and be clear for the runner up position. ONECALLTHATSALL turned in an even effort while racing three wide most of the way, not enough for the
place. DOLLY'S GUITAR within striking distance early, ranged up to try the winner in the three path late in the turn, failed to sustain that advance in the
drive. TROSKA broke sharp, relinquished the advance to the winner into the turn, chased that one into the lane off the inside, gave way. TECHE SOLUTION
off slow and was always outrun.

Footnotes
HEY MADALYN CLAIRE with the pace from the start after breaking with the leaders, held a narrow advantage into the turn, headed late in the bend,
continued to duel into the lane, extended drive to the wire, exchanged a couple of brushes with LA VIE EN ROUGE with less that a furlong remaining,
narrowly gained the nod over that one and the runner up at the wire. STRAWBERRY SUNDAE lacked early foot, steered out abruptly to be five wide into the
lane, idled past the furlong marker then lodged a late push to rapidly close the gap on the two leaders late to just miss. LA VIE EN ROUGE broke with the
leaders, vied three wide into and through the turn, dueled with the winner through the lane, exchanged brushes, missed while between the top two at the
wire. CAILIN TAPA last to leave, continued to be slow to settle early, was floated out six wide into the lane, improved position a bit without posing a serious
threat. TAP IRON FIST void of speed in trailing for three furlongs, improved position in upper stretch then flattened out the final furlong. DREAMED I AM
FAST headed up the second flight early, saved ground to no avail, had little left for the stretch drive. CONTINENTAL RED contested the issue up front
between the other two leaders, gave way entering the stretch. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH THE STRETCH,
NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

SPLENDA GAIL settled early along the inside behind the two leaders, angled out and was three wide into the stretch, roused, closed with good
determination to be up in time while between the next two at the wire. FLASHY MEG dueled up front while in the two path, disposed of the other speed to be
clear with a furlong remaining, could not contain the winner in the waning strides while holding sway for the second spot. FIRST I'VE SEEN broke back,
raced four wide when lacking speed through the turn, rallied down the middle of the strip to be clear of the others, not enough for the top two late. BUCKLEY
BUNNY last away, remained back in lacking a serious response in the drive while steadily steered out. DEBBIES PASSAGE broke on top, alternated up
front for three furlongs and began to falter. GATOR PROUD fell back to trail after the start and never menaced.

TARGET PRACTICE broke well, narrowly showed the way closest to but not on the rail, continued in the two path into the stretch, edged clear under firm
handling inside the furlong grounds, continued to slowly increased that advantage to the wire. CUSTOM BLUE GRASS back off the early pace, cut the
corner to trim the winner's advantage into the lane, chased that one past the furlong marker, could not keep pace to the wire while holding the second spot.
PEANUT N IKE pressed the winner from the outside for a half, fell back off that one nearing midstretch, drifted out and was outkicked late for the runner up
position. BRYKEN N MITCHELL forwardly placed while widest of the first group, four path into the lane, had little left in the run to the wire. HEZA PICKLE off
slowly to spot the field a couple of lengths, remained back and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CASH BIZNESS broke on top, showed the way into the turn, rated in the run through the turn, clear into the stretch, drifted out, held the runner up safe late
under a steady right handed crop. CUSTOM GUITAR behind the pace inside, continued to save ground when moving a bit closer late in the turn, roused for
the drive, managed to only slowly carve into that drifting winner's margin in the late going, well clear of the others. JULIO CHOICE prompted the winner
three wide, continued in a forward position turn, could not keep pace with the top two through the lane, narrowly saved the show. PEPPER POINT last
away, raced back off the early pace as a result, improved position upper stretch, not enough late for the show spot. MAVE RUNNER in the main group
outside, continued four wide through the turn, made little impact through the lane in lacking a closing kick. MY LOVELY CHARLIE within striking distance
outside, four wide into the lane, weakened through the stretch. MY LITTLE GARDNER broke back and was never a threat. OUR STARLET fell back to trail
after the stat and showed little.
