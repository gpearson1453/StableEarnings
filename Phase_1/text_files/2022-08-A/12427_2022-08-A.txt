Footnotes
CONFIDENT N ELITE showed good speed to lead leaving the chute, was uncontested through the turn, opened up in upper stretch and was kept to the
task the last eighth to win comfortably. BLACK SUN stalked inside mid pack down the backside, commenced his run going three wide with a quarter to go,
closed outside belatedly through the stretch to get second but never threatening for the win. MIA AND ME chased the leader through the first half, began to
weaken with a furlong to go and lost second in the late stages of the race. MYSTIC POINT chased the speed on the rail, was in tight slightly midway on the
turn, angled outside nearing the quarter pole and was one paced in the final furlong holding on for a minor share. ACTION POINT settled near the back in
the beginning, advanced mildly on the rail through the turn and could not gain on horses through the stretch. SCENIC HOLIDAY stalked outside mid pack
down the backstretch, made a mild move between runners on the turn and flattened out down the lane. BODIE was void of any speed early to trail, closed
the gap on the pack while running five wide through the turn and had nothing to offer turning for home.

Footnotes
SUIGU STAR settled off the pace racing in the two path into the turn and moving out four deep later on that bend, advanced rapidly midway up the
backstretch, bid four to five wide in mid-stretch taking the lead outside the sixteenth pole and kicking clear then held off a late charge from an inside rival.
SILENT CREEK saved ground inside just off the leaders, advanced on those but had to steady near the half-mile marker, came out a path leaving the
second turn, lacked room in behind a drifting and tiring pacesetter, found room inside about the sixteenth pole and closed fast but too late while galloping
out ahead just past the wire. TIMMINS settled off the pace mostly two to three wide, came out a bit in upper stretch, ran on evenly to get up for show
honors. NGABE stalked from the two path leaving the first turn, took closer order up the backstretch, bid three wide turning for home but evened out. TWO
YEAR CONTRACT moved clear and shifted in soon after the break to dictate terms just off the rail, was challenged turning for home, drifted in and out just a
bit in the stretch while weakening. LIKESO was urged at the break but lacking speed, saved ground through both turns, lacked room in the stretch and
levelled off. LILNMIGHTY chased two to three wide early and up the backstretch, began to drop back three then four wide on the far turn and was empty for
the drive. ORIGINAL ME got away awkwardly about five lengths slowly, moved out five wide leaving the first turn, advanced outside rapidly and then
steadily dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
ULTIMATE STORM stumbled on the break and quickly recovered to get a good tracking position down the backside, waited behind the frontrunners inside
through the turn, slipped up the fence at the eighth pole to lead and held well late for the victory. STAR CHAMBER settled near the back soon after the
break, was roused through the turn outside of runners, turning for home was in the seven path rallying, battled through the entire stretch with an inside rival
for the place award getting up right at the wire to win the nod. BENLION trailed soon after the start, advanced inside at the three eighths pole, then angled
out at the quarter for clear run in the seven path at the top of the stretch and closed well contesting for second just losing out at the wire. GOZILLA stalked
on the outside in the beginning, loomed five wide turning for home to bid for the lead and ran evenly in the late stages getting a minor placing. HEAT
MERCHANT led through the backstretch on the rail, continued to be in front through the turn, was headed in upper stretch running between rivals and
weakened inside through the stretch. LUV TO WIN broke well to lead leaving the chute, pressed the inside pace down the backside, inched up for the lead
through the turn, briefly took command in upper stretch between foes and faded at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
RED HIERARCHY tracked in behind the pace near inside, found room at the rail in mid-stretch, bid at the sixteenth pole and edged away under steady
handling. SILENT FLASH stalked from outside two to three wide through the turn, struck the lead past the three-sixteenths, drifted in a path in mid-stretch,
was overtaken a sixteenth from home and outkicked. MARTEN RIVER moved to the fore readily to set the pace while shifting in, went on or just off the rail,
was overtaken in upper stretch, in a bit tight between rivals nearing the sixteenth while weakening and lacked the needed late kick. WESTERN TROUBLE
had a couple light brushes at the start, switched outside foes and moved up to race close to the leaders three to four wide on the turn, needed more in the
stretch. SPEEDY BOLT settled off the pace inside, came out three to four wide for the drive and failed to rally. GOLDMINE CAT chased the leaders
mid-pack three to four wide through the turn, lugged in a bit in upper stretch and weakened. EXECUTIVE SEARCH exchanged a light brush at the break,
settled toward the rear five wide into the turn, shifted to the two path about the three-eighths, was never near enough to threaten. MONEY MATTERS was
fractious in the gate, exchanged a light brush at the start, was in tight between and behind runners early, tipped out four wide early on the turn, tired in the
stretch.

Footnotes
PHILZANO tracked the pace on the rail in the early stages, started to advance while angling outside midway on the far turn, was three wide turning for home
to close well between runners bumping slightly with an inside rival mid stretch and was drawing away in the last sixteenth. SASKATCHEWAN broke inwards
at the start, took command early into the first turn, continued to set the pace down the backside, opened up into the stretch, started to weaken at the furlong
marker and just held onto second place at the wire. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN was squeezed soon after the break, steadied on the first turn, began passing
horses on the rail with three eighths to go, angled to the 4 path turning for home and closed well gaining steadily through the stretch just missing second
place. WHY NOT BOURBON chased the leader throughout, was between runners entering the stretch contending for the lead, found tight quarters with a
sixteenth to go and was steadied in the late stages of the race. HARD ROCK WARRIOR chased the pace early, was in tight on the rail going into the first
turn, was shuffled back inside to trail down the backstretch, roused with a quarter to go and passed tiring rivals late. DETERMINED FRIEND was squeezed
on the break, settled near the rear outside through the half, angled inside on the far turn and could not get into contention down the lane. THIS WAY OUT
angled out into the first turn going four wide, made an early move at with a half to go to contend, was ridden on the far turn to keep up and retreated
between runners through the lane. FOREST SELECTION broke out at the start, was floated out on the first turn going five wide, stalked in mid pack through
the backstretch, was ridden on the far turn and had no response in the stretch. JOCKEYS CLAIM OF FOUL AND STEWARDS INQUIRY #2 WHY NOT

Footnotes
NIAGARA SKYLINE stalked in behind mid-pack going two to three wide on the turn, came out four to five wide for the drive, struck the lead about the
three-sixteenths, drifted in a bit and cleared off while taken in hand late. SALVATOR MUNDI settled mid-pack inside, came out three wide into upper stretch
then moved out a bit further to following in behind the winner, just got second. TOLD IT ALL tracked off the leaders inside, lacked room about the eighth
pole, tipped out and finished strongly to just miss the place. SIR SEAMUS set the pace facing moderate early pressure racing inside on or just off the rail,
was overtaken in upper stretch, kept on but was outfinished for the minor placings. SOUPER SUCCESS settled off the pace, was encouraged along midway
on the turn and moved out from two to four wide leaving that bend, angled six deep for room past the furlong marker and improved position.
RECONFIGURE raced mid-pack three to four wide on the turn, came out five wide for the drive, lacked the needed late kick. SUNSPEAR stalked outside
the second flight three wide, weakened in the stretch. ELEKTRONIC pressed the pace two to three wide, came up empty. THOR'S ROCKET was outpaced
early shifting in, swung seven wide into the stretch and was never near enough to threaten. CORDUROY ROAD got away awkwardly and several lengths
slowly, encouraged along four wide on the turn, was unable to menace.

Footnotes
SOUPER COHIBA broke out on the start, took command into the first turn, led through the backside, was headed at the quarter pole and when asked
responded well to draw away at the end. LION'S GOLDENHEART advanced while four wide into the first turn to chase the winner down the backstretch,
threatened for the lead at the quarter pole, was repelled by the winner turning for home but fought on stubbornly in the late stages to hold on for second.
MOON OVER MONTANA tracked the pacesetters into the first turn, settled behind the frontrunners inside with a half to go, was coaxed on the rail through
the far turn, angled out to the three path for the run to the finish and ran on evenly the last furlong to get the show placing. ANTIGONE tracked the pace into
the first turn, rated between runners mid pack at the half, advanced between rivals on the far turn, angled out top of the stretch five wide and closed with
some interest late for a minor part. BOURBON EXTENSION settled near the back early, was ridden to keep up on the far turn and was never really a factor
throughout. SOLAR was brushed on the break, raced five wide on the first turn, circled runners on the far turn going five wide to contend at the quarter pole
and backed away between runners through the stretch. GIANT CRITIC was brushed at the start and trailed, raced wide throughout and never got involved.
SOBERANO (FR) broke inwards to start, advanced between runners through the backstretch to contend with three eighths to go and retreated midway on
the far turn offering little in the late stages.

Footnotes
READY HERO bumped with a rival just lightly at the start, was forced in early, settled off the pace near the inside, angled six wide into upper stretch, took
aim and under strong and steady urging got up at the wire. GENDRAGON stalked three wide, struck the lead about the seven-sixteenths from between
rivals, kicked clear by mid-stretch while drifting to the rail, just failed to last. BOKERMIN bumped lightly with a foe at the break, forced in early, pursued two
to three wide in the second flight, came out in mid-stretch and kept on to get up for show honors. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE got away alertly and soon moved
clear shifting in to dictate the pace in about the two path, faced challengers on the turn and was overtaken, kept on evenly to regain a minor award from
POUND GREEN, who moved forward four wide into the turn, was on nearly even terms early on that bend, evened out in the stretch. COMMANDER TOM
bumped lightly at the start with a rival, was taken up early and lost several lengths, trailed inside into the turn, swung eight wide and passed rivals. PUGIN
chased mid-pack five wide and outside into the turn, weakened thereafter. LETTING LOOSE bumped lightly with a rival at the start, chased inside,
weakened. OVER THE HILLS chased three wide and between foes, came up empty.
