Footnotes
LA FAMILIA accelerated to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail, switched to her left lead inside the eighth pole and dug in late. SIDNEY SUE
saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, eased off the rail in upper stretch and rallied. AWESOME LAWSON , a forward factor three deep around
the turn, had aim on the leader in upper stretch and weakened. CHARGINA lacked speed, moved four wide entering the stretch and passed tired horses.
ICY REPLY raced forwardly in the two path between horses and gave way entering the stretch. MAGIC IN ME raced in mid pack and failed to rally.
WILLOW DRIVE hopped at the break and was outrun. LADY TIZMO , five wide entering the stretch, faltered.

Footnotes
CHARMING WAY , snugly rated three to four wide and outside rivals, took closer order in hand past the three eighths, shifted out a bit wider soon into the
lane with her sights set on the leader, responded heading to mid stretch and spurted clear, kept on under right handed asking and widened.
PREPAREFORTAKEOFF cleared early and dropped in to about the two path, was joined leaving the chute and disputed the pace inside of CHICA
RABIOSA, saw that one edged clear leaving the far turn but maintained a forward spot under some coaxing, eased out a bit entering the lane and kept on
with good energy to earn the place. BETCHA BY GOLLY pulled her way forward in the opening furlong then had to tap the brakes multiple times when
keyed up behind rivals, was shuffled back mid turn, came back along the rail with a run past mid stretch then flattened out very late. CHICA RABIOSA vied
outside a rival before clearing leaving the far turn, set the pace off the rail around the turn, was guided out a few paths in upper stretch, failed to contain the
winner's bid past the three sixteenths, stayed willingly to the sixteenth pole then faded. DRY WELL , off the pace and three wide between rivals mid turn,
angled five wide for the drive, chased between runners inside the sixteenth pole but failed to generate a legitimate finish. STARTWITHABANG settled off the
pace, raced four wide mid turn, shifted six wide for the drive but came up empty. QUIET IMAGINATION stalked two to three wide, was under pressure mid
turn, angled out in upper stretch then faded.

AMUNET , alertly taken to the inner rail soon after the break, remained along the rail for six furlongs, eased out approaching the stretch, was four deep at
the head of the lane, closed outside horses, led late and drove clear. LUNAR ICE , rated along the inner rail to upper stretch, eased out approaching the
eighth pole, bid for the lead between horses in the sixteenth pole and was no match for the winner. SELF ASSURED , taken to the inner rail entering the first
turn, set the pace to inside the eighth pole and weakened late. NIBBLES stalked the pace, circled the far turn three wide, had aim on the lead in upper
stretch and weakened. DIVINE FASHION , reluctant to load into the starting gate, four deep entering the first turn, prompted the pace outside SELF
ASSURED and tired in upper stretch. EMERALD LACE , fractious behind the starting gate, raced along the inner rail most of the trip and weakened.

Footnotes
MARATHONER rated close up while outside a rival, eased out and worked his way between rivals nearing the furlong grounds, gained command outside
the dueling leaders near the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a drive. BOMBOLONI , off a bit slow and squeezed back, regrouped and raced well off the
inside, came under pressure leaving the far turn, circled five to six wide into the lane, straightened away and closed willingly to gain the place. CLAUDEE
BOY , bumped at the break, hustled up soon after and prompted the pace outside SPIKEZONE, moved to the attack three wide entering the lane, dueled,
gained a brief advantage in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. MOSE PERFECT came in at the break tightening BOMBOLONI, straightened and rated
off the pace while saving some ground, came three wide under a ride into the lane, angled out for the final furlong and had a mild response. SPIKEZONE
sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, met a challenge nearing the lane, came off the rail a bit soon after, battled past mid stretch then faded.
GHOSTLYPRINCE , bumped at the break, stalked three wide, edged closer past the three eighths, wandered outward a bit entering the lane, gave hard
chase while drifting past mid stretch and weakened. COSMICALITY saved ground in a tracking spot, eased out under pressure for the drive, failed to kick on
past mid stretch and faded.

Footnotes
DIVINE LAW , alertly taken to the inner rail leaving the chute, raced inside horses around the turn, remained inside foes through the stretch, rallied on his
left lead and was up near the finish. HE ROLLS showed speed, opened up on the turn, raced well off the inner rail through the stretch, was on his left lead in
the drive and gave way grudgdingly. ESPRESSO LUNGO lacked speed, was in the five path between horses in upper stretch and had a slight rally. PHRA
PHROM , lightly bumped by STEADY EDDIE leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three wide, chased the pace through the stretch and weakened.
BRIDGE TO SUCCESS lacked speed, raced widest on the turn, was seven deep turning for home and failed to be a factor. LAW OF THE JUNGLE , in the
six path turning for home, steadied in tight quarters in upper stretch. STEADY EDDIE came out at the break, hugged the inner rail while chasing the pace
and retreated through the stretch. EPIC RISE saved ground around the turn and gave way. WEST VIRGINIA BOY dropped back on the turn and was eased.

Footnotes
IN VAIN rated close up while saving ground, eased out two wide while stalking around the turn, drifted out a bit soon into the lane, responded to firm left
handed asking and moved to engage the leader in mid stretch, wrested command soon after, drifted out with a sixteenth to go, was corrected with right
handed encouragement and held firm. LADY MOSLER , in range while off the rail, took closer order between rivals entering the lane, drifted in slightly soon
after, shifted back out and kept on gamely to gain. BETTER CALL MAMA was nudged clear early, set the pace towards the inside, gave some resistance
when collared nearing mid stretch, stayed willingly to the sixteenth pole then weakened. GIFT OF GAB , three wide early, dropped in entering the stretch but
lacked a solid kick. HALEIGH B unseated her rider pre race and jogged off about three sixteenths of a mile before apprehended, dropped off the early pace,
swung wide and had belated action. GRISETTE broke a step slow, raced well back around the turn, came three wide for the drive but lacked a rally. HEARD
saved ground giving futile chase and faded. FOLLOWING WIND had speed and chased outside the winner, began attempting to get out leaving the far turn,
wandered outward entering the lane and tired. The trainer of LADY MOSLER lodged an objection against the winner alleging interference in upper stretch.
No action was taken.

MO MONEY MO HONEY prompted the pace outside FRIAR TUCK, secured command approaching the stretch then eagerly pulled away while ridden out.
FRIAR TUCK , bumped by ROMINSKI leaving the starting gate, set a pressured pace along the inner rail, was no match for the winner and gamely held the
place. MAGIC MULE raced in the two path between horses on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and finished willingly. IT'S SIZZLING TIME ,
three deep around the turn, weakened through the stretch. ROMINSKI bumped FRIAR TUCK when bearing in leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner
rail in hand entering the turn, gave way mid way on the bend, drifted out entering the stretch and was eased late.

Footnotes
ZOLA B , forwardly placed early on, steadied briefly nearing the turn, regrouped and moved closer in hand mid turn, shifted in a bit and surged between
rivals inside the sixteenth marker, took command inside the leader and drew clear under a drive. SASSY BABE prompted the pace three wide, bid outside
the leader soon into the lane, spurted clear a furlong out, failed to contain the inside challenge but kept on well to the wire. BOUND FOR BROADWAY ,
three to four wide, steadily advanced outside foes into the lane, loomed in mid stretch then flattened out. FLAVA'S DREAM dropped in early, tugged her way
forward while saving ground mid turn, waited briefly, eased out for the drive and advanced between runners past the sixteenth pole to finish with interest.
HOT CHOICE , off the early pace, moved up five to six wide in upper stretch but failed to seriously follow through. MADAME CLAUDE sped to the front then
cleared, set the pace two wide, was joined soon into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. SHINY PENNY failed to menace. OIL ON CANVAS ,
between rivals heading to the turn, lacked a bid. MY SUPER SALLY broke poorly, lagged into the turn, swung six wide into the stretch but came up empty.
BULLETS LADY moved up inside early and stalked, failed to kick on in upper stretch and faded.
