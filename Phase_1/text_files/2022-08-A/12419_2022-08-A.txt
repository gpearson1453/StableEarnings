Footnotes
ONE AMERICA disputed the pace outside GENERAL STRIKE and narrowly prevailed in a determined drive under energetic urging. GENERAL STRIKE
showed speed inside horses, hugged the inner rail the final half ,mile while dueling with the winner and was hand ridden the final furlong after the rider of
ONE AMERICA knocked the whip out of his rider's hand. PHRA PHROM lacked speed, raced along the inner rail on the turn and through the stretch and
passed tired rivals. ADDY'S LADDY T N T , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. BRILLIANT ICE broke slowly, failed to be a factor,
swung to the five path in upper stretch and his rider dropped his whip near the eighth pole. GRAND MANNER , rank mid way down the backstretch, raced
inside horses and weakened.

Footnotes
ONE TWO KID settled off the rail, travelled three deep into the far turn, responded to pressure and picked things up past the five sixteenths, shifted out five
wide for the drive, closed steadily outside rivals while under left handed asking, took command late and was edging away at the wire. GOLDEN DECISION
rated close up while saving ground, eased out past the five sixteenths, bid three wide to engage DUNDALK soon into the lane, dueled outside rivals past the
eighth pole, gained a slim advantage inside the sixteenth pole then ceded grudgingly. RESIDENT LIBERAL relaxed nicely while saving ground, quickly
moved up past the five sixteenths and took aim, snuck through along the rail to challenge nearing mid stretch, dueled briefly then continued with good effort
while salvaging the show. DUNDALK cleared early, set a rated pace towards the inside, edged away a bit leaving the far turn, came further off the rail for
stretch run, was hooked from both sides, fought on to deep stretch then gave way grudgingly. DADDY'S COZY , in the clear near the five eighths while not
far back, made a four wide run under a ride into the lane but failed to sustain in the final furlong. ATREYU settled off the pace while inside rivals, gained
towards the rail approaching the quarter pole, shifted out and stayed in touch to mid stretch then faded. MOKHEEF , unhurried early, saved ground making
a mild run into the stretch, angled out but lacked a further response. MUCHO MAS GRANDE , three wide the first turn, raced between rivals into the far turn
and faded. MYSTERY BANK prompted the pace outside the leader for six furlongs then tired.

HOP PICKER saved ground around the turn setting the pace under confident handling, was put to the whip near the sixteenth pole and edged away.
SMART EULEE stalked the early pace outside horses, moved up three deep on the turn and gamely chased the winner through the stretch. THAT'S SOME
KISS , three wide around the turn, failed to menace the top pair but was best of the rest. LADY LOOKOUT , outside the winner down the backstretch,
chased that one for a half mile then gave way. SARATOGA NOTION , a forward factor along the inner rail for a half mile, gave way. NANCY MY LOVE ,
sluggish to begin, trailed.

COBBLE ROAD vied outside RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY from the start, dropped back a bit while under strong handling nearing mid stretch, battled back while
being floated out, took command between rivals in deep stretch and grimly prevailed. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY grabbed a short lead early on, secured the
inside and set a pressured pace, dueled from the far turn, briefly edged clear while drifting out near mid stretch, continued to wander outward through the
final furlong, kept on valiantly but just failed to hold. IMAGE MAKER tracked the dueling leaders three wide, moved up to take aim into the lane, gave hard
chase while being carried out and kept on with effort to bridge the gap. WELLING settled in the clear and off the duel, came under pressure removed from
the inside mid turn but lacked a bid. DREAM BIG DREAMS lagged inside and well off the contested pace, made a decent rail run mid turn but failed to
continue through the drive. REASSURED , off the pace, was under asking mid turn but failed to respond.

in mid stretch and lasted under urging. SAMUI SUNSET , bumped, pinched back and forced in by BACKNHEWOODS leaving the starting gate, raced in the
two path between horses entering the far turn, eased out in upper stretch, moved to the six path in mid stretch and closed gamely. CRABS N BEER stalked
the pace inside horses down the backstretch, was well placed in the two path on the far turn and finished evenly. POWER BACK , bumped in a jam up soon
after the break, raced inside horses to the stretch, worked between rivals in the lane and passed tired ones. BENNY HAVENS stalked the pace, advanced in
the three path on the far turn, had aim on the leader in upper stretch and weakened. MY BOY PADDY , jostled on both sides and pinched back soon after
the start, worked between horses in mid stretch and passed tired foes. BACKNTHEWOODS caused a jam up when bearing in leaving the starting gate, set
the pace along the inner rail and weakened in upper stretch. B DETERMINED lacked speed, raced in the three path between horses on the far turn and was
not a factor. MINT GAME was outrun.

the lane, was guide two to three wide soon into the lane then spurted clear, kept on under strong handling through the final furlong and dug in tenaciously to
prevail. THE WOLFMAN tracked three wide under a light hold, took closer order as the pace battle became more heated past the five sixteenths, shifted out
five wide soon into the lane, kept on grinding outside rivals past mid stretch and got the bob for the place. OTIS OTIS OTIS prompted the pace outside the
winner, moved alongside when given his cue past the five sixteenths, was fanned four wide sparring into the lane, saw the winner get away a bit near mid
stretch but continued on with a strong effort between rivals to cut back into the margin. BERNIE'S ON FIRE had speed to the inside then rated back to track,
sat in a pocket approaching the quarter pole, eased out soon into the lane, edged up with aim in mid stretch, altered back in but flattened out. CONFUSION

wider to pursue to mid stretch then lacked the needed finish. SHOULDA HAD IT broke slowly, lagged off the pace, angled well wide for the drive but failed to
seriously kick on. THE GREAT DANSKY , inside a rival early, came under pressure mid turn and faded. JAMMIN STILL , off the pace while saving ground
mid turn, failed to menace.

Footnotes
PASSWORD PROTECTED lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, remained along the inner rail to the eighth pole, altered course to the four path
approaching the sixteenth pole, closed determinedly and was up at the finish. ELEAZAR , bumped by VIOLENT ROCK leaving the starting gate, raced
slightly off the inner rail set a pressured pace around the turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. BOWIE TWO STEP raced in mid
pack on the turn, hugged the inner rail through the stretch, challenged for the lead inside the eighth pole and finished gamely. CHAUFFEUR , caught in tight
quarters leaving the starting gate, swung to the eight path in upper stretch and closed outside horses. CHAMPION BY DESIGN prompted the pace outside
ELEAZAR to mid stretch then weakened. VIOLENT ROCK bore out leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail on the turn, swung out entering the
stretch and flattened out. GOLD GUY , a forward factor in the four path between horses around the turn, weakened through the stretch. WINSTON'S GOLD
raced between horses on the turn and in the stretch and failed to rally. SWEET ASTA was not a factor. FLASH IS BACK , in the three path between horses
around the turn, gave wayuin the drive. REMEMBERING WILBUR , five deep on the turn, gave way in upper stretch.
