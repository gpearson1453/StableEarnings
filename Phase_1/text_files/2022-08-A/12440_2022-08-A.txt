Footnotes
BE THE ONE settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, seized command leaving the eighth pole and drew
off. ROUGH ENOUGH disputed the early pace two wide, settled off a tearaway leader down the backstretch, advanced two wide around the far turn, took
the lead leaving the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, had no answer for the winner in midstretch but stayed on to be a clear second. FLAT
OUT COOL chased the pace two and three wide, bid in midstretch and was outkicked. PRESENCIA hesitated at the start, trailed inside, advanced three
wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and was no threat. KATNISS failed to menace while racing two and three wide. MOONLIGHT
TANGO set the early pace along the rail and faded inside. STARE IF YOU MUST saved ground off the pace, checked off heels late on the first turn and
made little impact. THE CUBAN MISSILE advanced three wide to the lead around the first turn, drew off down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail
around the far turn and retreated through the lane. LOVE CHANNEL was outrun inside. MISS KEEN was bumped at the start and played no factor while
racing three and four wide. RAHTID was bumped at the start, saved ground in midpack and had no response. LATTE LOVER raced three and four wide and
was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
SEA TRIDENT stalked the pace three wide, seized command nearing the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging and
held clear. SEPTEMBERTEN tracked the pace two wide, was unable to gain on the winner in the lane but stayed on to be clearly second best. NEW YORK
STYLE lacked early speed, raced two wide around the turn, swung six wide in upper stretch and was along for the show. DEMOCRACY was fractious in the
starting gate, was off slowly and never threatened while racing three wide. POSITIVELY AWESOME dueled two wide for five furlongs and tired. OLD TIME
REVIVAL dueled inside and retreated through the lane. ED'S DOG was outrun inside.

TINKER TAILER set the pace along the rail and widened under a drive. TAKEMYSHOT prompted the winner two wide and settled for second best. SIR
SAMUEL was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide and was along for the show. NORTH CAUCASUS saved ground off the pace, advanced
four wide around the far turn but flattened out in the lane. STRONG AGAIN prompted the pace three wide around the first turn, chased two wide around the
far turn and had no closing bid at the rail in the lane. KING ALFREDO was bumped at the start, raced two and three wide and never threatened. FIRST
TEAM broke inwardly and bumped KING ALFREDO at the start, saved ground and failed to menace. KEFI broke in a tangle, saved ground and made little
impact. SUPER GREMLIN lost contact, was eased, cantered across the finish line and walked off.

pole, edged ahead in upper stretch, dug in inside FIFTY ONE FIFTY reached near even terms near the sixteenth pole and held that one at bay. FIFTY ONE
FIFTY raced four and five wide in midpack, bid outside of the winner near the sixteenth pole, fought on to the wire but was turned back. HARD TO HANDLE
prompted the pace three wide, was pushed out four wide nearing the lane, was bumped near the three-sixteenths pole, could not match strides with the top
two in the final furlong but stayed on between foes to win the show duel. BEAST MARKET hit the starting gate then came out and bumped AFY KID, had
speed inside, was bottled up in tight quarters at the rail around most of the turn, angled three wide near the quarter pole, bumped HARD TO HANDLE near
the three-sixteenths pole, bid between foes, had the rider lose the whip near the eighth pole and was outfinished for the show. KEANU set the pace in the
two path, was collared near the five-sixteenths pole, battled on inside to midstretch then weakened. AFY KID was bumped between foes at the start, raced
well back two wide and never threatened. GET KHOZY was bumped at the start, raced two wide and made little impact. DREAM ON BABY hit the starting
gate then was bumped between foes, raced two wide and played no further factor. MIAMI PLAYER was outrun while racing five wide. BAD HENRY trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
AWESOME STRONG set a clear pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and widened under a drive. TURBO stalked the pace three
wide, angled to the rail nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the winner but stayed on willingly for the place. CAJUN HOPE hit the gate at the
start, advanced five wide around the turn and ran on for the show. KNOX raced off the pace two wide and passed tiring rivals. THIS RUN'S FOR YOU was
in range while racing three and four wide and faded through the lane. COMMANDANT ducked in at the start, raced two and three wide and never
threatened. UNDALAY had some speed outside, steadied nearing the half-mile pole, raced three wide around the turn and had no further bids. ZELENSKYY
STRONG had only brief speed inside. AWESOME FLAY was outrun inside. MALCOMS ON THE RUN trailed in the two path.
