GRAYDAR'S DREAM sprinted clear to set all the pace and was kept to task in the drive. NEW GOSPEL tracked the leader from the two path and couldn't
gain on the winner to prove second best. DOWNTOWN BROWN stalked the pace from the two path went four wide in upper stretch to finish strong.
UNSOLVED was forwardly placed on the inside but was empty in the stretch. WILLY B raced back early from the three to four wide and was hustled along
on the backstretch but was never a threat.

WILD FIREMAKER pressed the pace from the two path to the eighth pole, inched away and held off the late closer for the win. OUT OF THE SKY vied for
the lead from three to four wide made a late run down the stretch but was too late. BETA CAPO SONG led from the inside, was collared at the eighth pole
and out finished in the drive. ZCAT'S CHATAIN chased the leaders from the two path then lacked room at the five sixteenths pole and was taken up then
made a rebid but was not enough. MAXIMUS THE GREAT raced back from the two path and improved late. RISKY BOY saved ground to no avail.
STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING NEAR THE FIVE SIXTEENTHS POLE, AFTER A REVIEW ZCAT'S CHATAIN WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS
OWN PROBLEMS AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
