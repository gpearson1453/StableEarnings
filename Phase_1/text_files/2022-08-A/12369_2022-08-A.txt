BIG TIME LOUIE stalked the early leaders from the outside, was a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the
win. BE THE CHANGE forced the early pace, dueled on the turn and vied through the stretch in a good effort. GLITTER MOUNTAIN showed speed from
the inside and chased on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. AWESOME MINER was hustled early and had a slim lead on
the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way.

MAMMOTH SPRING set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. BEST AND FINAL was off
slow and gained ground on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. MY BUYBACK was in touch and a factor on
the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. SLIGO CALLING was in range and roused on the turn but had no late kick. TATTRAN
stalked the early leader and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch faded. HOLD YOUR LIQUOR broke poorly, lost ground
on the turn and was empty.

HALF LIT tracked the early leaders from the outside, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. WILD RIVER
WOLF was hustled early, raced evenly on the turn and had a mild bid in mid stretch but was second best. LIVERPOOL MAN had an unfair start and was
refunded. RAYO COLORADO had no speed, saved ground on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was all out. DEALMAKER set the
pace and had a clear lead on the turn but gave way at the top of the stretch. A STEWARS' INQUIRY INTO THE START RESULTED IN LIVERPOOL MAN
BEING DECLARED A NON STARTER AND WAS REFUNDED FOR AN UNFAIR START..

Footnotes
DILETTANTE was away alertly, a factor on the turn and with the lead from the four path at the top of the stretch prevailed. CHASING VINNY was in mid
pack, raced evenly on the turn and was up for place. FAFA FOOEY was unhurried early and moved up on the turn but from the five path at the top of the
stretch needed more. GOLD VENTURE stalked the early leader from the inside and had a good position on the turn but from the three path at the top of the
stretch leveled off. CORRELATE was well back, trailed the field on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch had no impact. TORPEDO MAX
was hustled early but headed on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
FRERET was in touch, raced evenly on the turn and with a bid from the three path in mid stretch drew clear. MS. P'S BELLA was unhurried early, saved
ground on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished well. LIME was hustled early and had the lead on the turn but was headed at the
top of the stretch and had nothing left. ASHBURY was in range and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. BABY
LUNA stalked the leader and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch evened out. FUN COOL was away alertly but chased on
the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. LINDA LOVES LACE was off slow and closed the gap on the turn but was no threat.
EASY ACCESS broke poorly and showed little in a dull effort.
