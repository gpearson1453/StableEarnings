MAE SAI PRINCESS stalked from the three path, took the nod approaching the three eighths pole, raced clear and rounded the far turn at the rail and was
steadily handled in the lane. MARKETABILITY rounded the opening turn about the three path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced
close off the rail on the far turn and settled for second best. DEVILISH BEAUTY settled back off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the half mile pole, eased to
the six path through the far turn and came along for third the final strides. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY raced boxed near the rail early and settled off the pace,
gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and was nipped from third the final stride. JUST A BIT SASSY raced
well back about the three path and left the first turn outside, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the six and seven paths
and passed rivals widest. COURAGEOUS GRACE rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came
through the far turn off the rail and weakened in the lane. TORCH CARRIER stalked two deep then faded past the three eighths pole.
SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS angled in and rated the pace, was met nearing the three eighths pole and gave chase from that point, but gave way into the far
turn and was eased in the lane.

three path, dug in for second mid-stretch and finished well. PINNACLE REEF was very difficult to load, chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in

XCELLENT START chased the pace inside, improved in the four path of the turn and closed rapidly through the stretch to get up the final yards. JUBA'S
NOTION pressured the pace then took the lead two deep past the five sixteenths pole, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but was caught in the
final yards. STROLLINGINTHEWIND chased, rounded the turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. NO LOVE FOR JUBA gave chase inside,
ran near the rail on the turn but was hemmed in through the upper stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. XIT NOW set a pressured pace, was met at the
rail leaving the five sixteenths pole, continued close at the rail on the turn but weakened into the lane. TO THE TOP gave chase and rounded the turn near
the rail. AREYOUGONNAKISSME was not a factor and raced off the rail on the turn. BAND TOUR saved ground.

DEEMED ESSENTIAL gave chase about the three path through the backstretch, took the lead two deep midway on the turn, lost ground into the lane but
drew clear past the eighth pole and was steadily handled to widen the final sixteenth. EXTRA CRUNCHY hopped leaving the gate then gave chase inside,
raced near the rail on the turn, dug in through the stretch and got up in a later duel for second. LUCKY US chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn,
angled to the five path into the lane then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. KYMMIES CHARDONNAY set a pressured pace, was met at the rail
midway on the turn and weakened inside the eighth pole. SALTY SAUL chased through the backstretch, entered the turn off the rail but lost ground into the
lane and flattened stride. SPLENDID VIEW angled out to give chase, rounded the turn about the six path and showed little in the lane. TOUGH ONE gave
chase, rounded the turn in the four path then weakened.

DON'T TELL GRANDMA took a quick lead after a somewhat awkward break and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths
pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. PRACTICAL KITTY raced off the pace in the two and three paths, bid
nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the three path and had to settle for second best while gaining slowly on the winner.
SHESAHUMBLEHUSTLER saved early ground racing well off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn about the six path and
came along for third mid-stretch. MANGORITA saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in
the two and three paths and showed little in the lane. SUPERSNAKE saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn two deep then flattened in the lane. BUNNY PRINCESS tapered in to stalk two deep, gave chase toward the three eighths pole then
weakened at the rail on the far turn. FESSIN UP raced off the rail on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened in the four path
of the far turn. CRISPY GAL raced wide into the first turn and was not a factor. CHOSEN MISS dropped well back and saved ground.

Footnotes
JEFFERSON NATIVE contested the pace from the start, was brushed leaving the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge two deep on the turn and dug in
determinedly to eke out the nod over the game effort of MATH MAN MARCO, who contested the pace from the start, skimmed the rail and bounced into
Jefferson Native past the five sixteenths pole, remained close at the rail on the turn and dug in gamely to the finish. FIBER STRONG chased, rounded the
turn about the three path then flattened in the lane. ROCKET APPEAL chased through the backstretch, came through the turn about the three path, was
eased to the five path toward the head of the lane then flattened the final furlong. MARK DID IT gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path and
showed little more. DERBY DAY DREAMS gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the six path. GOT FLOFFY gave chase inside, ran at the rail on
the turn then weakened. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Jefferson Native for alleged interference leaving the five sixteenths pole,
lodged by the rider of Math Man Marco, though, found no cause for change.

Footnotes
TIMMY exchanged contact with Evanesco leaving the gate then picked up the chase toward the outside, dug in at even terms in the upper stretch, took the
nod mid-stretch and held well with steady handling. JEFFERSON SECURITY chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn, eased three
wide leaving the eighth pole and got up for second later yards. NEEDNOEXPLANATION was bumped and raced in tight at the rail early, closed to the front
nearing the three eighths pole, came under pressure at the quarter pole, dueled at even terms leaving the eighth pole but weakened the final sixteenth.
EVANESCO exchanged contact with Timmy leaving the gate and was bumped inward and into Neednoexplanation on the chute, gave chase through the
backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. MONKEY WRENCH gave chase then flattened in the three path of the turn. BOO
TOO chased outside, rounded the turn in the four and five paths and showed little in the lane. In this race, Rought Start became fractious and flipped in the
gate which also affected Bertram Flight. In addition, In High Gear became fractious in the gate and all three were late scratches as a result.
