Footnotes
JUST FUN MHF was settled then raced three wide into the turn, rallied and was in a long drive and proved best in the end. RB LOCK N LOAD set the early
pace and drew off on the turn, bore out turning for home and was in a hard drive, shied from the whip in late stretch and hung in the end. ERIN MHF was
saving ground on the turn then made a bid three wide in the stretch, was gaining ground but was no menace in late stretch. QMR REBECCA LANDRI was
unhurried early then made a mild rally in the stretch but was no threat. WMA FAIRY DUST was unhurried early and no menace. TM PURNCESS was
chasing the early pace while inside, was used up then gave way. SOUTHERN CHARM MHF showed brief foot and stopped. WMA AMERICANA had brief
speed and stopped.
