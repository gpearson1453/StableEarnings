THRUTHESTORM stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn, gained ground outside in late stretch and
held off a late closer despite his rider having lost his stick in the drive. MUSICS MY VICE chased the front pack on the inside in the early going, navigated
the turn from the two and three path and gained ground steadily to the wire to just miss. NEW MEXICO JEREMY led the field on the inside up the
backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the bend and was caught in the final sixteenth of a mile. NACHO GRANDE chased the leaders on the
outside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and kept on in the lane. PAGOSA DREAM stalked the pace setter between
horses in the opening stages, raced in the three path around the turn and finished evenly. TATAS JOE MARK pressed the pace between horses up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and tired in the lane. SMARTSREALGOOD raced at the back of the pack on the inside in the early going,
saved ground around the turn and made no bid. TOP HAT VISCOUNT raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two
path and was empty in the stretch. INDIANOFGOLD trailed the field on the far outside up the backstretch, raced in the three and four path around the turn
and was never a factor.

MOTOWN MAMMA pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and drew off in the final furlong. NATION
OF LAWS chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and kept on in the lane. BINGOS SYSTEM hit the
gate leaving it, recovered to chase the frontrunners on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the four path and was no match for the winner
in the stretch while finishing evenly. BODIE'S LOVE was reluctant to load, broke well and tracked the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a
mile, saved ground around the turn and weakened late. WIN LIKE COACH P trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, raced wide around the turn
and made no bid. FAST AND FEVEROUS raced at the back of the pack on the inside early, navigated the turn from the two path and was empty in the
stretch. HEAR ME ROAR led the field on the inside up the backstretch, took up sharply while saving ground around the turn and was eased in the lane. A
STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE SUDDEN CHECK OF THE FOUR HORSE, HEAR ME ROAR, ON THE TURN. UPON REVIEW, NO
CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
LAS TRES MARIPOSAS stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and wore down her rivals to pull clear
in the final furlong. CURL dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and in upper stretch, was caught
with a furlong to go and chased the winner home from there. FLOWER POWER dueled for the lead between horses in the early going, battled from the two
path around the turn and gave way in late stretch. ALSONO'S HUNTER raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a
mile, came around the turn wide, entered the stretch in the six path and finished evenly. CORA BELLE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the
early going, navigated the turn from the three path and was outkicked in the lane. MAGNIFICANT MONEY raced off the pace on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. ALLIE R raced off the pace on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and
came up empty in the lane. CHA CHA TOUCH raced at the back of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and
was never a factor.
