Footnotes
LUNA FORTUNA was quick to begin to set the early pace, raced off the inside down the backstretch, continued its run in the stretch while racing well off the
inside and remained clear under steady handling. COFFEE ESSENCE broke to the outside, raced off the early pace, moved up four wide near the quarter
pole, gained ground well late and got up for the place position. SUZY Q THE QUEEN settled near the back of the pack early, raced three to four wide in the
stretch run and had no final winning bid. QT BLIEGH was void of early speed, angled widest through the stretch run and moved up. MIAMI GOLD stalked
the early pace and weakened in the drive. EL MILAGRA settled off the early pace and failed to respond. MISS COREY chased the early pace from the
outside and gave way.

Footnotes
CHARLIE THE GREEK found the perfect trip around the turn, traveled in open space down the backside, called on along the inside around the far turn,
under late pressure, shifted out around leg weary leader, held off outside rival, got the nod. POLITICAL stalked the leaders around the first turn, off the pace
and three wide down the back stretch, came under a strong ride top of stretch, lugged in deep stretch, all out drive late just missed. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN in
control around the first turn, very nice tempo down the backside, took solo lead deep into the stretch, came under heavy pressure at the eighth pole, could
not hold off the outside closers, finished even at the wire. WALL lacked early speed, found nice even pace down the backside, quickened under a hand ride
while racing along the inside, shifted out deep stretch, found best strides late. ONLYAMATTEROFTIME tracked leader around the first turn, in good position
down the back stretch, asked midway turn, between runners nearing the eighth pole, checked in tight, faded through the wire. MY FRIEND LINUS three
wide around the first turn, in no hurry down the backside, urged on for run entering far turn, came up empty through the stretch.

shifted in to the three four path, dug in and just missed in a game effort. ALL ABOUT ME tracked the early leader down the backstretch, raced well off the

Footnotes
ISTRIA broke sharp, took the lead position around the first turn, very comfortable tempo down the backside, quickened around the far turn, cleared off easy
stretch, kept to task leaving the furlong marker, hand ride late. MISS KRISTY stalked the leaders around the first turn, three wide while down the backside,
went all in while racing four wide around the far turn, stayed under a drive through the stretch, closed in and snagged the silver medal under the wire.
PHARIBE tracked leader around the first turn, held the outside stalking position down the backside, called on for best run midway far turn, lost contact with
eventual runaway leader, stayed on well losing the bob for place at the wire. BRIGHTHILL lacked speed around the first turn, dropped back nearing the
second turn, shifted out five wide at the quarter pole, closed ground willingly, while never a threat to the leaders. TOUGH GAME raced along the inside
around the first turn, eager to run on encountered traffic midway on the backside, continued along the inside, urged on far turn, came up empty. HOPEFUL
CURE stumbled badly leaving the gate, recovered to race wide around the first turn, was keen to run on down the backside, came under a ride far turn,
outrun through the stretch.

BOUND BY DESTINY stalked the early pace, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and finished strongly to just get up under strong handling. TAPPIN
JOSIE was off slowly, rushed from the inside to set the early pace, raced near the inside down the backstretch, dug in deep stretch while racing near the rail
and just missed in a game effort. CUZ UR PRETTY chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch, raced just off the inside in the stretch run and
kept on to the wire. SANSA ARIEL was coaxed along early while racing three wide, raced three deep between rivals in the stretch and kept on willingly to
the wire. LARAMORE was void of early speed, raced four to five through the upper stretch and had no rally.

SIR ALFRED JAMES was forwardly placed early on, moved up four wide through the upper stretch and finished strongly to be clear late under steady
handling. MOJOVATION broke awkwardly, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, continued its inside bid into the upper to take aim at the leader but was
no match in the drive. ABOUT TODAY (ARG) was quick to begin to set all the pace and weakened in the stretch run. SPEIGHTSFORD dropped to the back
of the pack early, lost ground and trailed throughout.
