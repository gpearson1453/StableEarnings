ground on the outside and pulled clear in the final furlong. TIZ RYE TIME raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, angled out to
began a five wide bid coming off the turn, switched to the inside with a furlong to go and gained ground between horses late. CONI'S COUP led the way on
the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and in upper stretch and weakened from there. JUST CALL RAY trailed the field on
the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was outkicked in the lane. ASHAAB chased the leaders in the early going,
navigated the turn form the four path and faded in the stretch. HIPPODROME dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the
turn and tired entering the stretch.

Footnotes
STEELE MONEY raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole,
switched to the outside to gain ground in the lane and pulled clear in the final furlong. RICHIESONAROLL bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the
gate, pressed the pace up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, took over the lead in upper stretch, was caught midstretch and chased the
winner home from there. DRAGON RUN raced at the back of the pack between horses in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path, and
improved position between horses in the lane. COPAZO veered in sharply leaving the gate, was urged to the front to show the way up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn, gave way in upper stretch and weakened late. RIGHT ON RICHIE bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, raced off
the pace up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and passed tiring horses on the outside in the final
furlong. THANK YA PETE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter
of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn, veered out in upper stretch, drifted back in and was empty from there. DART tracked the leaders on the
outside in the early going, raced in the three path around the turn and raced into traffic while tiring in the lane. BREWSINSKI chased the frontrunners on the
outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and faded in the stretch. MR. JEKYLL bumped lightly with the horse to his outside
leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside the entire way around the oval and was never a factor. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

FREE SOUL prompted the pace from the two path, bid two wide at the top of the lane, and drew clear. LUCK IN THE DUSK was squeezed at the start,
rated from the four path, swung into the five path at the top of the lane, and rallied. THEOLOVESAWINNER set the pace from inside, was coaxed at the top
of the lane, but yielded late to show. PAY THE SQUID stalked from inside, was driven from the two path into the stretch, but flattened. ROSCO chased
inside, saved ground around the far turn, but was tired. PRINCE SIMBA trailed into the stretch and was no threat. SIGMUND tracked in the three path, was
ridden from the five path into the stretch, but was empty.

Footnotes
CONAGHER led the field on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled while saving ground around the turn, fanned wide entering the stretch
and dug in in the lane while drifting mildly late to hold his margin to the wire. OLD HOMESTEAD chased the leader up the backstretch, raced in the three
path around the turn and continued to pursue the eventual winner down the stretch while drifting in slightly in the final furlong. NO SABE NADA raced in the
middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground mildly in the lane while never threatening the
top two. EXXEL dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and faded between horses in
the final furlong. LOGICO hit the gate leaving it, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two and three path around the turn and made no bid. ZATIP
raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
MASTEROFTHESENATE was unhurried from inside, was driven along from the four path heading into the stretch, shifted in passing the three sixteenths
and rallied up the inside to win. CHENTI tracked from the three path, swung into the five path at the top of the lane, and stayed on to place. TEPPER stalked
inside, was hustled from the four path coming into the stretch, and ran on for show. QAADER raced from back in the three path, tipped into the six path at
the top of the lane, and improved. BLAME B B rated inside, was ridden along in the four path coming to the top of the lane, and improved position.
GUARANTEED SPECK was well back and in the three path, was ridden six wide at the top of the lane, but finished evenly. DEAR SANTA raced in midpack
from the two path but was empty at the top of the stretch. ACAMAR pressed two wide, took the lead rounding the far turn, but yielded coming into the
stretch. DOTHECAN'TBEDONE (FR) chased between rivals but was never a threat. STREET FIGHT prompted the pace while three wide but faded coming
into the stretch. MOTANAAFER was bumped at the start, trailed, and was no factor. PHAROAH'S FURY set the pace inside but yielded rounding the far
turn.

pace in the two path through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the four path and came up empty in the lane. ROWDY JESS bumped and
was squeezed back leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the five path around the second
bend and was not a factor. SIMILAR TASTE raced in the four path around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, came around
the far turn in the three path and faded from there. THE DUNGEON bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate, saved ground while trailing the
field through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the far turn and made no bid. THATZA ALPHA raced into traffic and steadied while
saving ground around the first turn, chased the front runners on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn, swung wide into the
stretch and tired. ON A WHIM chased the leaders from the three path around the first turn, challenged on the outside racing up the backstretch, began to
drop back from the three path around the far turn, entered the stretch wide and tired to the wire.

PROJECT TWO (IRE) led the field the entire way around the oval, remained in command throughout and drew off down the lane. GREY ILLUSIONS (IRE)
settled at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening lap, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground late, the best of the
rest. THAI TERRIER raced off the pace on the inside in the early going and improved position in the final half mile. LUDICROUS MODE chased the leader
on the outside through the opening mile, continued pursuit of that rival headed into the final lap and weakened in the stretch. CAPTAIN MIDDLETON (IRE)
raced in the middle of the pack on the outside throughout the race and finished evenly. AHNAF raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the opening
stages, continued around the second lap between horses and faded entering the stretch. TAPWOOD stumbled landing off the first jump, recovered to track
the leader on the inside around the oval and tired on lap two. ROYALE trailed the field through the first mile, pulled up the second time up the backstretch
and walked off.

Footnotes
PLEASECALLMEBACK trailed early, steadied briefly into the far turn, was coaxed four wide to bid at the top of the stretch and was driven clear. QUALITY
CHOICE raced in midpack from the two path, swung into the five path at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. LA HARA (IRE) was well back inside, was
roused from the two path at the top of the lane, but finished evenly show. TWENTYONEGUNS rated between foes, saved ground into the stretch, but
flattened. MARKET BUBBLE tracked inside, was ridden between rivals into the stretch, but was empty. HARD GAME was well back early, made progress
three wide rounding the far turn, but faded into the stretch. ONDALOVE (FR) stalked between foes but dropped out rounding the far turn. SEISMIC WAVE
was well back and three wide, but lost the rider after jump four. BRAVE DEACON raced in midpack from the two path, but was eased rounding the far turn
and was disqulified for running on the inside of the rail. REAL FACTOR set a loose lead but stumbled over jump five and lost the rider. ONDALOVE (FR)
and SEISMIC WAVE both walked off.
