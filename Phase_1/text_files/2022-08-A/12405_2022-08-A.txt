Footnotes
SICILIAN GRANDMA broke in at the start bumping MAGGIE T in tandem with ACQUA BELLA, chased two to three wide until tucked briefly inside placed to
coaxing half a mile from home, tipped out three wide midway on the turn and advanced on the front, rolled by the embattled top duo swinging four wide into
upper stretch, then went clear under a drive getting geared down in the late stages. MAGGIE T bobbled at the break and got bumped between foes who
each broke her way conceding two to three lengths to the front, chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on clear of the rest to be along second best. GIRL
AFRAID coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with LADY QUINN to her inside from the get go, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, got
overhauled spinning three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive while along clear for the show honors. ACQUA BELLA broke out at the start
bumping MAGGIE T in concert with SICILIAN GRANDMA, and got bumped in behind GIRL AFRAID conceding three lengths to the front, chased four paths
off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into
upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. OCEAN HONEY coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide, came under coaxing briefly tucked to
the two path at the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and tired. LADY QUINN hustled from the gate, dueled inside of GIRL AFRAID from
the onset coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, got overthrown in tandem with her main pace rival at the quarter pole by the eventual winner, cut the
corner into upper stretch and faltered in the drive. BENEVOLENTLY six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn
and came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ALLURING ANGEL (GB) was urged along while well off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch then tipped further
out, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed with a rush to get up late. COWICHAN (IRE) settled near the middle of the field, was roused in the two
path on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, drifted in some while gaining outside the sixteenth-pole, took the lead
into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. PRIVATE CREDIT was hustled from the gate, established a good position just off the pace,
was asked while saving ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, pursued the leader into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked while able
to get the show. PALLOTTA SISTERS was fractious in the gate then backed out and deemed fit to run by the state veterinarian, settled in the back half of
the field, was asked while inside on the turn, moved off the rail into upper stretch, came out outside the eighth-pole then bumped with FACTOR THAT, held
a reasonable striking position in the final furlong but lacked the needed kick. ILLICIT angled in while going to the front, set the pace under pressure from her
outside, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear near the quarter-pole, responded well under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, was put to the crop
outside the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken and weakened. GUSTIAMO was reserved at the back while tugging at the bit under stout restraint, dropped
back more under a very tight hold leaving the backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, was finally roused nearing the quarter-pole, came
under the crop in upper stretch and failed to threaten. GORMLEYESQUE was hustled from the gate, steadied off heels near the nine-sixteenths, raced just
off the pace, was given her cue in the three path on the turn, chased four wide into upper stretch, was forced out while dropping back inside the
three-sixteenths and capitulated. TATTERED HEART was fractious in the gate, settled towards the back on the outside, was roused three then four wide on
the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. FACTOR THAT was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, was asked for more
in the two path on the turn, dropped back three wide into the stretch, was taken up while out of contention after being bumped inside the three-sixteenths
and had nothing left.

Footnotes
PLAYED HARD coaxed from the start, attended the leader from the outside from the three path, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the
quarter pole, got set down spinning three wide for home, dug in dueling with BOSTON POST ROAD through the stretch drifting out in tandem with that rival
straightened away before being corrected, dug in trading brushes late to the wire and gamely got the nod on the line. BOSTON POST ROAD three to four
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, drifted out two paths straightened away in concert with the
aforementioned foe, dug in taking command three-sixteenths from home, dueled through to the finish with PLAYED HARD trading light brushes a sixteenth
out while fighting on gamely but ultimately lost the bob on the wire. W W FITZY coaxed from the gate, showed the way just off the inside under the close
watch of PLAYED HARD to the outside, came under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch under threat from a pair,
yielded near the three-sixteenths and weakened to the finish. MILLEFEUILLE stumbled at the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. FLASHNDYNAMITE coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until tucked
inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ALPINE QUEEN showed early speed while dropping from the two path to the rail on the first turn, was eased back off the pace with six furlongs to run then
rated just behind the leader, drafted inside early on the far turn, came through an inside opening to make a bid at the three-eighths then took the advantage,
moved to the two path while drawing clear, was roused near the quarter-pole then put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop
inside the furlong marker, drifted out into the final sixteenth and maintained a clear advantage to the wire while held together in the end. TACTICAL RANGE
went around the first turn in the two path, steadied behind horses late on that bend, bumped with a foe near the three-quarter pole, was reserved off the
pace, drafted in the two path behind horses early on the far turn, waited briefly behind those foes as the winner made a rail bid at the three-eighths, dropped
to the inside then followed the winner at the five-sixteenths, moved out in pursuit of that foe in upper stretch and safely secured the place. MY SWEET WIFE
bobbled at the start but broke with the field, showed early speed on the inside, dropped back late on the opening bend, bumped with a foe near the
three-quarter pole, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, saved ground early on the far turn, shifted three wide outside the
five-sixteenths, was guided back to the rail outside the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. RAFFINITY
was sent hard from the start, raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside under coaxing, chased three wide around the far
turn and tired. STORMI CAT LADY dropped well behind in the three path on the first turn, lagged at the rear, was urged along in the two path on the far turn,
came three wide into the stretch and was no factor. EXFILTRATION broke out and brushed the gate at the start, was hustled to the front while four then
three wide around the opening bend, went clear with six furlongs to run, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, lost the lead inside the
three-eighths and stopped. VOICE OF SPRING was hustled from the gate, dropped back along the rail on the first turn, settled well off the pace, moved out
with five furlongs to run, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, went three then four wide around the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch and faltered.

ONE MORE BABY coaxed from the gate, raced three wide through the opening bend before settling three wide attending the leader nearly latched on to the
outside, began to steadily advance on that rival into the far turn and took over command near the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch under a
drive, went clear through to the sixteenth marker and was geared down in the late stages, the outcome in no doubt. MISTICAL CURLIN just off the inside
through the first turn, chased along the inside down the backstretch before going two to three wide through the far turn under coaxing from the half mile
pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to the finish and just got up for the place honors in the very last
jump. RIVER OF NO RETURN coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths under pressure to
the outside, yielded the front near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong getting nailed for the
place honors on the wire. NORDIC LIGHT three to four wide through the first turn, raced three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. LEFTY'S WAR coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out,
angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. NECCO chased just off the inside throughout coming under coaxing from the half mile pole and faltered in the
stretch. QUESTION MY SANITY grew detached at the tail of the field chasing just off the inside, got placed to coaxing half a mile from home and took the
inside route through the turn, tipped out six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SENSIBLE JIM coaxed from the start, chased along the inside
coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, went three wide into upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
ART COLLECTOR displayed early speed on the outside, went around the first turn in the three then two path, showed the way down the backstretch,
controlled the action while inside on the far turn, cruised past the quarter-pole in the two path, responded well under a very mild hand-ride in the stretch and
proved much the best. MASQUEPARADE was hustled from the gate, went four then three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was
urged along passing the half-mile pole, chased in the two to three path on the far turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly
while second best. CHESS CHIEF brushed with a rival at the start then was hustled, showed speed between horses in the two path, dropped off the pace
late on the first turn, settled outside under some urging down the backstretch, chased three to four wide on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch,
battled outside of MYSTIC NIGHT for the show in the drive and narrowly earned that position while no match for the top two. MYSTIC NIGHT was coaxed at
the rear early, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the back, moved up between foes outside the nine-sixteenths, brushed with a rival near the
half-mile pole, remained between horses in the two path on the far turn, moved to the three path while roused late on that bend, was driven four wide into
the stretch then came out under a left-handed crop, battled inside of CHESS CHIEF for the show honors and just missed that position. BAL HARBOUR had
the assistant starter hit the jockey in the head with his arm at the start then brushed with a foe, saved ground on the first turn, was rated just off the pace,
brushed with an opponent around the half-mile pole, chased inside on the far turn, dropped back coming to the five-sixteenths and faltered.

EMARAATY (GB) coaxed from the gate, settled in pursuit two to three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled six wide
into upper stretch, offered up a good kick to close stoutly and loosely between foes in tandem with ATONE and just got up in the very last jump to the finish
by a nostril. FLORIFORM coaxed from the start, tracked the pace along the inside from just off the pace patiently handled until let out spinning just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily wearing down the leader while under threat from a pair to the outside, seized command strides from
the finish but was nailed in the shadow of the wire. ATONE saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled
out four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, offered up a good finish closing in the outermost of a quartet latched on a sixteenth from home and
just missed at the end. BYE BYE MELVIN showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into

Footnotes
MISS DOMINA was hustled from the start, settled comfortably off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, rallied four
wide into the stretch, gained to make a bid near the furlong marker, took the lead into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. MISPELLED
MOOON tracked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the two to three path on the turn, took the advantage into upper stretch, led under a drive to
the sixteenth-pole then was caught while able to get the place. STUCK ON KITTEN broke out and brushed the gate, was bumped hard near the five-eighths
then steadied, went around the turn in the three path, angled out under a drive in upper stretch and finished with late energy to just get the show.
FREEDOMOFTHEPRESS was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, checked behind horses near the five-eighths, moved from the rail to the three path
on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, chased the leader while remaining on her inside lead in the drive and was out-kicked then just missed the show.
R REPOSADO LOCA came out over heels behind a checking foe near the five-eighths then bumped hard with a foe and steadied, went around the turn in
the two path, swung five wide into the stretch and improved position. O'GOTTEN GIRL chased the pace down the backstretch, traveled around the turn in
the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick. MANDY GREEN settled well back in the field, saved ground on the turn,
came off the rail in upper stretch and never reached contention. MISSING LINK broke in and bumped with a foe while last away, moved out late on the
backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. FAST COREY was hustled to the lead, showed the way down the backstretch, vied
inside to the two path while challenged on the turn, was asked for more near the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into upper stretch and gave way.
MERAVIGLIOSO settled on the outside, went four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and was no factor.
