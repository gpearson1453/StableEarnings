Footnotes
TAILORBESWIFT, in touch with the leaders nearest the inside in the opening stages, was eased off the pace in the second furlong, shifted out three wide
nearing upper stretch advancing to challenge, took over leaving midstretch and went clear under pressure. ELEMENTAL, a bit reluctant to load, prompted
the pace three deep in the opening stages, pressed the issue between foes into the lane and prevailed for the place honors in late stages. GRAND SLAM
HOMERUN was urged pressing the pace between foes in the opening stages, dueled for command inside rivals on the turn and weakened in the drive.
TICK TOCK settled last racing to the turn and made some belated progress along the rail. HONEY PARADE WAS SCRATCHED AFTER BEING INJURED
IN THE PADDOCK PRIOR TO THE RACE. NIP NAP WAS SCRATCHED AFTER DISLODGING HER RIDER AND RUNNING LOOSE FOLLOWING THE
POST PARADE.

Footnotes
LOCK IT DOWN, in touch prompting a rival's pace under light rating in the opening half, took over nearing upper stretch to go clear midstretch and held the
late challenge of DIGGS WON under firm handling. The latter angled to the inside in early stages dropping off the second flight while under reserve,
continued under patient handling into the far turn, briefly awaited a path nearing upper stretch, tipped out to the four path entering the lane and responded to
find her best stride late to close the gap on the winner. CHAPLAIN tracked off the first flight along the inside to the far turn, tipped out nearing upper stretch
but had no closing bid. LAKE LADY, off slowly while being bumped at the start, settled last along the rail to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn,
then shifted out in the closing stages to improve position between rivals late. NORDIC QUEEN tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight
racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide entering the lane and faded in the drive. ALITTLEBITALEXIS, urged along the inside dictating the pace on a
narrow margin to the backstretch, dueled for command inside the eventual winner on the far turn and gave way into the lane. MISS KITTY RUSSELL broke
inwards bumping a rival while getting away slowly, raced wide into the first turn and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
DAREABIGDREAM broke outwards brushing a rival to race within striking distance in the three path in the opening stages attending the pace, continued in
that path entering the turn, moved to challenge for command racing into upper stretch and took over in the closing stages to prevail under firm handling.
COACH HAPPY tracked off the second flight racing four wide through the backstretch into the turn, advanced to contention while being fanned five wide in
upper stretch but continued willingly to close the gap late. IRISH TUFF broke slowly, settled last along the inside on the backstretch, switched out racing
through the turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch and continued with interest between foes to prevail for a share late. PROFOUND ONE, urged along the
inside from the outset dictating the pace into the turn, held sway into upper stretch but gave out once headed by the winner leaving midstretch. BIT COINER
tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight, came under pressure to lodge a brief bid between foes racing through the turn but proved empty in the
drive. TWILITE LIASON, brushed at the start, tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn and gave way early. VALLEY VISTA angled inside
early tracking the leaders in second flight and steadily faded into upper stretch.

Footnotes
CHOCOLATEICECREAM, reserved along the inside in the opening half, steadied off a tiring foe racing into the far turn, tipped out while held up between
foes advancing in close quarters under light reserve just off the inside racing into the lane, then responded to firm encouragement to reel in RIVER ROSE in
time. The latter gained a forward placing racing to the first turn, was rated tracking just off the first flight to the second bend, shifted out three wide on the far
turn advancing on the leaders, moved to wrest a clear advantage midstretch, resisted the winner's bid to the end but just failed to contain that rival.
ROCKTIZWAY, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset, dueled for command inside foes through the far turn into upper stretch but yielded to
the top pair late. BOURBON TAN angled to the inside tracking the leaders in second flight, tipped off the inside nearing the far turn, shifted out four wide
racing through the stretch and finished evenly late. TALLESTOFTHETALL was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the far turn, shifted three
wide entering the lane and continued evenly. IMA HARLEY TOO tracked the leaders three wide in second flight in the opening half, was fanned four wide
into upper stretch and steadily faded. SIDE STREET DAVE was urged prompting the pace three wide from the outset to the far turn and gave way.
KENHEDOIT, urged along the inside disputing the pace from the outset, gave way racing into the far turn. HATTIES JEWEL proved no factor.

Footnotes
WHITE LIES was rated out of striking distance along the rail racing through the backstretch, commenced a steady advance saving ground into upper
stretch, tipped outside a rival approaching the sixteenth marker, wrested the advantage and went clear in time under firm handling. COST A FORTUNE was
urged inside a rival disputing the pace in the opening stages, shook clear entering the turn to opening a safe advantage racing into the lane but failed to
sustain that momentum. PRINCESS LIVIA was urged prompting a rival's pace through the backstretch, couldn't match that foe on the turn but continued
with interest to prevail for a share between foes on the wire. ALQWANI broke slowly, settled last early, angled to the rail entering the turn and displayed
some belated interest. FADED MEMORIES tracked off the first flight a bit off the inside in early stages, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch while
being prompted to advance but lacked the needed closing response. BIG ANDY settled into stride shifting well off the inside in early stages and proved no
threat. LATER DAYS dropped out early.

Footnotes
SIERRA HOTEL was rated off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, shifted out splitting foes with an early advance nearing the far turn,
made a sharp move three deep to challenge for command on the far turn, went clear racing into upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm
encouragement. UNBROKEN SONG was rated in the last flight along the inside in the opening stages, shifted off the inside splitting rivals racing through the
far turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to edge rivals for the place honors. VIOLIN MAKER was settled last in early
stages, angled to the inside racing to the backstretch, gained some position inside foes on the far turn, tipped outside a tiring foe nearing upper stretch, then
angled back to the rail in the closing stages to prevail for a share. KRAMDEN sped clear of the field along the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace to
the far turn, briefly dueled inside the eventual winner nearing upper stretch but gave way into the lane. PALACE PRINCE tracked the pacesetter between
foes in second flight, was urged to make a brief bid racing through the far turn but came up empty in the drive. FAYETTE WARRIOR tracked the pacesetter
inside rivals in second flight from the outset to the far turn and came up empty nearing the lane. SEEKING REFUGE was rated off the second flight outside
a rival in early stages, was caught four wide racing into the far turn and had no rally. OUTRUN THE POSSE tracked the pacesetter three wide in the second
flight in the opening half and emptied out early.

Footnotes
MORRIE'S JOY, off slowly, was rated along the inside in the last flight to the backstretch, tipped out after a half gathering momentum, advanced on the
leaders four wide racing through the far turn to challenge for command past midstretch and prevailed under strong handling. MORGS WORLD tracked the
leaders in second flight in the opening half, advanced to challenge three wide between foes, led late, then resisted the winner's bid but came up second
best. INTENSE COMPANY (IRE) was rated off the second flight racing to the backstretch, tipped out entering the far turn, awaited an opening between foes
nearing upper stretch, shifted outside the top pair late and finished willingly. OFF RAMP, in touch prompting a rival's pace, dueled for command between
foes to upper stretch and faded late. ROLLIN BLACKOUT was rated along the inside in early stages, swung out five wide into the lane but made no impact.
JEWEL AZUL settled outside foes in early stages and failed to menace. DESERT GLOW angled to the inside tracking off the first flight, saved ground to
upper stretch, was caught in tight quarters entering the lane and came up empty. SECRET HIDEAWAY delayed proceedings when first balking when
entering the track, then requiring a substitute rider and never proved a serious factor. INDY'S STAR was urged along the inside disputing the pace from the
outset to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
DYNAMOMETER was urged to force the pace outside a rival from the outset, forged clear racing through the turn and widened under pressure. HUNTER
JUMPER was urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace into the turn but proved no match while besting the others. LL'S CLASSY DUDE tracked
off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, tipped out entering upper stretch and continued well enough to earn a share. SPEEDY DAREDEVIL
tracked the leaders three wide in second fight racing to the turn but offered no rally. STUN GUN settled last on the backstretch and passed some tiring rivals
late. WILDCAT SKY made brief pursuit of the leaders a bit off the rail racing to the turn but soon emptied out. INTHEMIDNIGHTHOUR proved no factor.
JEROMIEO made brief pursuit of the leaders between foes and gave way after a half.
