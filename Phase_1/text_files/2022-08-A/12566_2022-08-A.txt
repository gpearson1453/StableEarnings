Footnotes
PECOS AUTUMN was kept close from outside, commenced her bid after two furlongs, engaged SILVER POM POM on the bend, took the advantage when
asked inside the final furlong and drew off when asked again inside the last sixteenth. DELTA LADY well placed from inside, waited for a clear path on the
turn, rallied along the rail in the stretch and caught SILVER POM POM for second with seventy yards to go. SILVER POM POM soon had the lead, showed
the way between horses, was challenged from outside on the bend, floated out some for the stretch run and gradually wore down inside the last eighth.
BELLS OF JOY hustled from the beginning, was a brief factor from inside, angled out through the turn and gradually drifted out in the lane. UNEEKY
forwardly placed toward the outside, faded two wide on the turn.

Footnotes
READY REDDING shared the early lead from inside, retreated after a half mile, angled out four wide on the second bend, took the advantage approaching
the last furlong then drew off in the late going. CARTE BLANCHE was checked and steadied repeatedly behind traffic in the early going, altered outside with
five furlongs to go, gained the advantage three wide on the second turn, battled in the stretch but did not have enough left inside the last eighth. SOME
DUDE progressed from outside, was five wide taking the second turn and found best stride too late the final furlong. ASTOROTH shared the lead between
rivals, gained the rail nearing the second bend, and gradually wore down the last two furlongs. TOWN AGENDA was steadied behind traffic on the
backstretch, swung out four wide on the second turn and began to yield before finishing six furlongs. GREENSPAN broke outward, advanced from outside
to vie for the lead on the backstretch but began to shorten his stride two wide on the second bend and steadily faded.

Footnotes
EMOJI PRINCESS rated along or just off the pace through the early going, went for the lead two wide on the second turn, was clear entering the stretch
then steadily opened the last eighth. BURNING BUSH was a step slow at the break, commenced her bid after a half mile to threaten three wide on the
second bend, floated out further into the lane, started steadily drifting out inside the last eighth but gained second. MARQUEE COWBOY displayed speed
just off the inside, gained the rail on the second turn, was overtaken nearing the end of six furlongs, no match for EMOJI PRINCESS when set down for the
drive, began to wear down in the late going but was easily best of the rest. KENKEAD raced in contention from inside for six furlongs then gave way. BEE A
WINNER chased from inside, angled out midway on the backstretch, came into the stretch behind BURNING BUSH and had little to offer. CYBERTAP was
a factor just off the inside for a half mile then began to yield.

AH LEAH advanced from outside, angled in some into the turn, took over three wide on the bend and quickly drew clear, gradually drifted out through the
lane but maintained control. TWO MORE TIMES pressed the early pace from between horses, lost her path into the turn, split rivals three wide nearing the
quarter pole, moved clear for second upper stretch, could not close the gap on the lead in the late going but was clearly second best. PRINCESS
CONSUELA progressed four wide on the bend, lacked a significant stretch bid but caught LA GUERRERITA for third. LA GUERRERITA was hustled to
contest the pace from inside but began to yield before finishing four furlongs. PRINCESS MANDII displayed early speed just outside LA GUERRERITA,
retreated two wide on the bend, was steadied when TWO MORE TIMES squeezed through just outside her and continued to give way. HOOSIER GOLD
CASE was a contender just off the inside on the backstretch but gave way after a quarter mile. The rider of TWO MORE TIMES lodged an objection alleging
interference from AH LEAH at the three furlong marker. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
TEA AFTER BALLET dropped back from vying for the lead in tight quarters between horses before finishing the first furlong, came again four wide on the
turn, fanned out further into the stretch, was all out and edged ahead in the waning yards. CONGRATS ZAPPA shared the early lead off the rail but inside
rivals, gained the rail on the bend, moved clear upper stretch, did not have enough in the late going but proved easily second best. CONCOCTION vied for
the lead from between horses, was in close quarters just outside CONGRATS ZAPPA with two furlongs left then weakened for the drive. HIGH LIFE AGAIN
prominent just off the inside, faded along the rail on the turn then passed inside a few tired rivals in the stretch without threatening. THACKER FROMM
raced in contention running widest, progressed five wide on the turn then flattened out the last quarter mile. WAVE THE GOLD well placed from inside on
the backstretch, did not keep up into the bend, steadily angled out on the turn and passed outside fading horses the last eighth. BLEEDING BLUE a bit
awkward at the break, soon recovered to vie for the lead from outside before finishing two furlongs, was three then four wide taking the turn then gave way
between foes for the stretch run. TOWN CRIER raced in the second flight between horses early but faded two wide on the bend. OUTLAW SCAMP was
soon far back, never part of the race and walked off after crossing the wire. DUE TO RIDING CROP VIOLATIONS BY THEIR RIDERS, TEA AFTER
BALLET AND CONGRATS ZAPPA WERE DISQUALIFIED, LEFT UNPLACED AND THE PURSE WAS REDISTRIBUTED.

Footnotes
BOBBIE TOO TOO broke in stride, was rated on the front end outside rivals, moved ahead two wide on the bend, was asked when challenged again from
inside leaving the turn, fought to hold on under hand urging upper stretch, lugged in some when put to right-handed pressure inside the last furlong, was
straightened and drew away the final sixteenth. G CITY WARRIOR contested the pace between horses on the backstretch, retreated some as she gained
the rail on the turn, came again leaving the bend, battled in the stretch, did not have enough left in the late going but was unchallenged for second. LOUIE P
displayed early speed from inside, did not keep up into the turn, angled out soon after, was three wide into the stretch then could only hold her position the
rest of the way. ARCHIE'S GIRL failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. FIRST SQUADRON was away slowly, raced in contention from outside on the
backstretch, began to yield on the turn, did not respond to urging in the lane and was in hand late.

then could only hold her position late. AMARI S. raced in the second flight for a half mile, came four wide into the stretch then flattened out. BACKSTAGE
BAMBI in the second flight early just outside AMARI S., did not keep up four wide on the bend and gradually angled in as she continued to fade in the lane.
