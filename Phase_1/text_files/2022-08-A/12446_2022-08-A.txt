Footnotes
JUDGMENTAL tracked three wide, moved up to prompt the pacemaker from the three path, bid two wide while under a drive coming into the stretch, and
outdueled YOU YOUR DADDY SON to the wire to get up late. YOU YOUR DADDY SON set the pace from the two path, was cued inside at the top of the
lane, hooked up with JUDGMENTAL through the stretch and fought on gamely but was nosed out on the wire. CABRO TORO raced midpack between
rivals, was slightly keen down the backside, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, and improved for show. TINCAN MAN stalked inside, saved
ground rounding the far turn, but flattened. RONALDS GATSBY was bumped by LOWER CRETACEOUS at the start, trailed early from the three path,
moved up from the four path down the backside, was three wide into the stretch, but faded. LOWER CRETACEOUS broke in and bumped RONALDS
GATSBY at the start, was well back in the two path and never a threat.

BISPING prompted the pace from inside, made a bid from the rail rounding the turn, opened up at the top of the lane, and held gamely. RANCH WATER

drifting into the five path in upper stretch, drifted back in throughout the stretch, but held on to show. KING'S LUTE chased from inside, was ridden from the
three path at the top of the lane, but flattened. THE BOSS SOSS broke in and bumped into Customized Space at the start, trailed from the five path, swung
into the eight path coming into the stretch, and improved position. KIT KAT KIDD chased from four wide, was hustled four wide into the far turn, and faded.
CUSTOMIZED SPACE was bumped by THE BOSS SOSS at the start, was well back in the four path and never a factor. MANDOLORIA tracked five wide
but was empty at the top of the stretch.

raced in midpack between foes, was driven along in the four path coming into the stretch, but weakened. TENSAS CANDY was well back in the five path
and never involved. WHAT CAN I SAY rated from the three path but was never a factor. DORGENOIS trailed from the inside and never threatened. OUR
CUSTOM DARLING prompted the pace while two wide but backed out around the turn.

Footnotes
TAKES TWO TO TANGO set the pace from the two path, was cued while opening up at the top of the lane, and drew clear. BLACK SWORD was unhurried
along the rail, tipped into the six path while under urging into the stretch, and rallied for place. BRIAN'S IRON MIKE chased from the six path, was coaxed
while three wide at the top of the lane, and got up late to show. CREOLE CHARLIE stalked from inside, was ridden from the two path into the stretch, and
finished evenly. DOUBLE BARREL MAN rated while two wide, was cued from the four path into the stretch, shifted inside for a clear run, and improved late.
YANKEE SEVEN raced in midpack while three wide, was hustled from the four path into the lane, but weakened. X CLOWN tracked while two wide, was
driven four wide into the stretch, but was tired. ALTERANA hit the side of the gate and steadied, trailed and never threatened. SLITHER was squeezed at
the start, was well back and inside but was no menace. OCEOLA pressed from the three path but backed out around the turn.
