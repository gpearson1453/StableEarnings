came four wide into the lane and rallied, missed place. COURT AND SPARK was allowed to settle early on the inside, advanced three wide on the turn but
needed more late. SHARP RED EAGLE chased the early pace and made a mild bid on the inside but flattened out. INDOCTRINATE was reserved two to

Footnotes
UNCONQUERED SPIRIT was sent to the lead to set the pace on the inside, kicked clear leaving the turn and then remained clear to prove best after a
couple left handed reminders with the crop. SHADIZAAR was off slowly, void of early speed, advanced on the turn and came five wide into the lane and
finished with good energy to be clearly second best. COLBALOAF was rated along the inside, made a mild bid on the inside on the turn, but flattened out
the final furlong, held show. PURE COURAGE stalked the pace three wide and fell back on the turn, came four wide into the lane and faded. PAPAL LAW
steadied into the first turn while pulling hard, made a two wide bid to go up and prompt the pace on the backstretch, then was empty in the drive. ARTISTIC
ENDEAVOR was settled three wide early, then worked way down to the inside on the turn and had no rally.

SUNSHINE MAX was rated three wide and advanced four wide on the turn, came widest into the lane and finished well on the outside to edge away late
under a drive. TALENTED MAN was well placed on the inside, made a inside bid nearing the furlong marker but could not go with the winner late, second
best. HYMN'S SYLVIA tracked the pace and was three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the lane and kept on to get the show award.
OBROTHER ITSYLVIA was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on the turn, then was in traffic at the furlong marker and had no late kick, missed
show award. NICE WEATHER stalked the pace three wide and made a four wide bid on the turn but faded in the drive. ANY SUGAR HONEY set the pace
on the inside and then was three wide into the lane while dueling for command and weakened. CAPTAIN CHAZZ lacked a rally. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER
was off slowly and was not a threat. FRANK N DUCKY failed to menace. DIXIE CANNONBALL was not a factor.

and was outkicked to the wire by the winner. KITTEN'S SOLUTION vied for the early lead on the inside, then rider decided to rate back, made a bid
between rivals nearing the quarter pole, then vied for command between rivals through the lane and was outfinished. MY DEVILS CHILD vied for the early
lead on the outside early, then went on to set the pace on the inside, was headed leaving the turn and gave grudgingly. THE GREAT CASBY was reserved

HEROS REWARD set a pressured pace while in the three path, then made a bid leaving the turn and kicked clear to prove best under a drive.
MARTINKELLY was well rated early on the inside, then moved out and made a two wide bid on the turn by the quarter pole, then finished wiollingly to the
wire, second best. DOLLARIZATION was rated early on the outside, made a four wide move on the turn to loom boldly by the quarter pole but flattened out,
held show award. CRITICAL THINKING pressed the pace on the inside and faded. PICTOR was hustled along between horses, then was shuffled back on
the turn while still between rivals, shifted out and came five wide into the lane but had no punch. MIDNIGHT FIRE tracked the early pace and made a four to
three wide bid on the turn but stopped in the drive.

ON THE RIM was away alertly to set the pace on the inside while clear, drew off leaving the turn and then was hand ridden to the wire to score the
dominating victory. ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS tracked the winner three wide and was no match for that rival while being clearly second best.
MONEYONTHELINE chased the pace and was four to five wide and had no kick while saving the show award. NOTEWORTHY was settled early and then
had a belated rally. MISTER ARANGUIZ lacked a rally. BRANTLEYS BIG GUN was bumped at the start, then slammed again by the five eighths marker,
then shifted to the outside and was not a threat. RUN AWAY EMPIRE was off slowly and broke inward, then bumped a rival leaving the five eighths, then
advanced on the inside and had to steady at the five sixteenths, no factor. NOTORIOUS REY chased the pace on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
MY MAGICAL MAN was away alertly and was allowed to settle and save ground on the turn, eased out leaving the quarter pole, came four wide into the
lane, closed full of run to draw clear in the furlong grounds under mild left handed urging. VIOLENT PASS prompted the pace and made a three wide bid on
the turn and lugged in by the three sixteenth while clear, but had little left late, held place award. GEM JUAN was bumped at the start, reserved early, came
four wide into the drive and finished willingly to best the rest. BANKING ON BIZ stumbled at the start, pressed the pace between rivals and weakened in the
drive. COOL YOUR BOOTS passed the tiring rivals. THOROVER was well placed on the inside and weakened. DREAM OF WARRIOR set a pressured
pace on the inside and weakened.
