DONTCALLMESWEETY stalked the early leader, had the lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. BEST AND
FINAL was unhurried early, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. NO MORE was away alertly and roused
on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. WAR DOCTOR was hustled early, a factor on the turn but chased through the
stretch and had nothing left. I'M SO FLY settled off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and was never in contention.

PARTY OF NO set the pace, had the lead on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. SILENT FIRE stalked the early
leaders, was a factor on the far turn but was second best in a good effort. SAMUEL H tracked the early leader and had a good position on the far turn but
needed more. SYNCHROMESH was off slow and had a bid on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. TRINITY THUNDAH
was unhurried early and saved ground on the fart turn but was no real threat. BOCELLI was in mid pack and hustled along on the far turn but from the seven
path at the top of the stretch had no kick. MORE HARDER was well back, trailed the field on the far turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch was
not a factor. SALT MINE TEDDY was off the pace and roused on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response.

CALMING INFLUENCE was in touch, a factor on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew clear. LIVERPOOL MAN was unhurried
early, had a mild gain on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch finished well. UNDEFILED stalked the early leader, forced the pace on
the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held show. DIAMONDBACK showed speed from the inside and had the lead on the far turn but
from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. COCOTARA was well back, closed the gap on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the
stretch passed tired foes. JUSTINTIMEGOSNORTH had no speed and saved ground on the far turn but failed to fire. THELONIOUS was in range and raced
evenly from the inside on the far turn and faded in deep stretch. FINAL STRIKE was off the pace, chased on the far turn, pulled up in mid stretch and walked
off.

SUPER CHIANTI tracked the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch proved best. SHES ASTYLISH KATZ
was in touch, raced evenly on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was up for place. NATASHA'S BIZNIZ was away alertly and forced
the pace on the turn but needed more. J M R GEMMA had no speed and moved up on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch finished
evenly. DAZZLING DIVA was well back and closed the gap on the turn but had no impact. THE GREEN PLANET showed speed and had a slim lead on the
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. PESARO was up close early but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

Footnotes
SAVVY'S SISTER set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. BENADETTE'S LADY
was in mid pack and moved up on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. TIZ MY RIGHT was in touch and
roused on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no kick. GIZMO'S PRINCESS settled off the pace and raced evenly on the far turn
but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no threat. CASSIE'S RAINBOW was well back and had a mild gain on the far turn but was not a factor.
NEW YORK MINT stalked the early leader but chased on the far turn and came up empty. HIPPIE CHICK was off slow and showed little in a dull effort.
