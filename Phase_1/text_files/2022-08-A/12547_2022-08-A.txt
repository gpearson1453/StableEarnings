Footnotes
FAIRY DREAMS was well placed on the inside, was boxed by the quarter pole, slipped through leaving the turn and shook clear by the furlong marker, then
held sway late to prove best under a drive. WHATRUWAITINGFOR vied for the lead on the inside and came two wide into the lane, then kept on gamely to
the wire, second best. WENDY'S FINE WINE was rated early, came three wide into the lane behind the leaders, angled out for racing room nearing the
furlong marker, then drifted out under left handed crop urging bumping DANCE A LITTLE JIG leaving the furlong marker, then got up for the show award.
MANUELA vied for the lead three wide and came four wide into the lane and faded in the drive. DANCE A LITTLE JIG chased the pace three to four wide,
came five wide into the lane and was bumped leaving the furlong marker and had no kick. ESTA CHUCK was allowed to settle on the inside and failed to
respond. THE STEWARDS POSTED A INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING IN THE LANE, AFTER REVIEWING THE REPLAYS THEY DISQUALIFIED
NUMBER THREE WENDY'S FINE WINE FROM THIRD AND PLACED HER FIFTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE LANE.

Footnotes
SAMARONTI was reserved early on the inside, shifted to the outside leaving the three eighths and made a four wide move on the turn, took over leaving the
turn and drew off in the lane under right handed crop urging. FLAT OUT FLASHY tracked the early pace, then went up to press the pace three wide, made a
two wide bid on the turn to take over, then was headed leaving the quarter pole and was no match for the winner, clearly second best. VISHNU tracked the
early pace, steadied entering the backstretch, then made a three wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive, bested rest. CRYPT was void of early
speed, swung out six wide for the drive and had no rally. MOON MEISTER lacked a rally. BOCK was settled early and tired. ELUSIVE JESTER set the pace
on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
SWEET AND MACHA set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear by the quarter pole and then drew clear in the drive to prove best under mild left
handed crop urging. SCARLET LILY bobbled at the start, pressed the pace three wide and proved to be no match for the winner while running on to be
clearly second best. RISQUE'S JEWEL was settled early, then was two wide on the turn and had a belated rally to best the rest. LIL H chased the pace and
worked way down to the inside on the turn and weakened. SMOKE AND MIRRORS was off slowly, then advanced three to four wide on the turn, drifted out
badly in the lane and was empty. HERE I COME failed to menace. BLEZNIATKA was settled back early and on the inside on the turn and never threatened.
HONESTA was not a factor.

by the sixteenth pole, then kept the fast closing RUNNIN REDBIRD safe late, driving. RUNNIN REDBIRD was settled early towards the inside on the turn,
swung out six wide leaving the turn and closed the gap fast late, good energy. SONG SAVER pressed the pace on the inside, then was in tight by the three
sixteenths, angled out and was finishing willingly to the wire. VAN HAVEN set a pressured pace two wide and faded the final furlong. MS STRONG HEART
tracked the early pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. RAIN LILLY chased the early pace and made a four to five wide bid on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SALAGADOOLA was well rated early, saved ground on the backstretch, then was coaxed along on the turn and was boxed by the quarter [pole, angled out
leaving the turn for racing room, made a bid and drew clear in the furlong grounds to prove best under a drive. MS KAYS COWGIRL vied for the lead on the
inside, then shook clear on the backstretch and set the pace on the inside, then was headed by the furlong marker and could not go with the winner late,
second best. PAGE ELEVEN chased the early pace, then saved ground on the far turn to the quarter pole, eased out and then swung out five wide for the
drive and had no rally, bested rest. MADAMME IN LOVE was bumped at the start, settled early, three wide on the turn and had no rally. ALL THE WAY
MAE was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide and made a three wide bid on the turn and tired. FLY FLY BIRD was taken back early,
came wide into the lane and had no rally. MI PRINCESS DI vied for the lead three wide and stopped.
