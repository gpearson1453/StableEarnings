Footnotes
MY LITTLE JUNIOR broke alertly and raced with the early pace inside, fell back off the lead pack through the turn, moved out four wide into the lane,
challenged outside the leaders past the furlong marker, edged clear under steady handling. WHISKEY GENT with the pace while between rivals, narrowly
showed the way into the stretch, extended that advantage a bit nearing the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late, clear of the others. BIG
SESSY last to leave, remained devoid of speed for three furlongs, came in the two path for the drive, steered out widest past the furlong marker, finished
willingly to be getting to the runner up late. JACKIE MOON with the early pace between rivals and just outside the winner, narrowly showed the way into the
turn closest to the inside, weakened steadily through the lane. TEN BUDS vied up front while widest of the first flight, three wide into the lane, faltered
between rivals and inside the winner the final furlong. GRAND PRODUCTION remained back in lacking a closing response.

Footnotes
YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY asked away from the gate to clear after an alert break, continued to hold a daylight through the turn while given a bit of a breather,
coasted home through the stretch under intermittent urging. MISS NITAP in the second flight along the inside, continued to chase through the turn and into
the lane, could do little with the winner to the wire, remained clear of the others. FOR REAL ALICE also in the second group, raced in the two path and
outside the runner up through the turn, no match for that one or the winner through the stretch, clear of the others. BLUE RIDGE HEAT lacked speed and
was never dangerous while racing in the three path. AMERICAN REBEL lacked speed outside, four wide into the turn, retreated through the stretch.

B W P SPECIAL away in good order, pressed the leader up the backstretch and into the turn from the two path, extended stretch duel, proved best under
brisk yet confident handling. VEGAS GUY moved up to narrowly set the pace, continued to hold a small advantage through the tgurn, dueled upper stretch,
headed just inside the furlong grounds and proved stubborn to the end. WAITIN' ON A WOMAN in the second flight well off the inside, came four wide out of
the turn, set down, proved no match for the top two in the run to the wire, clear of the others. HAIL SOUTHERN within striking distance early toward the
inside, tired in the drive. ONE PROUD BOY last to leave, fell further and further back to be always outrun.

ROCKETT MAGIC broke with the leaders, took control along the inside into the first turn, worked clear before a quarter, was joined by the runner up from
the outside before a half, dueled into and through the final turn, headed between calls turning for home, regained the advantage in upper stretch, edged
clear past the furlong marker and maintained daylight to the wire under steady pressure. FISH N CHICK also away in good order, chased the winner
through the first turn, challenged from the outside before a half, dueled in the two path, gained a brief lead entering the stretch but could not keep pace the
final furlong, clearlyt second best. MSCHITCHATTOUR fell back to trail after breaking with the top two, continued void of speed while well out in the strip the
middle half, came four wide out of the final turn and staged a mild rally while not a threat to same top pair. L G GIRL settled off the pace while racing
maining the two path, had little left for the drive. CLOCKED IN TYME last away, was finished after a half, trailed home.

Footnotes
SWIFT N TRAFFIC broke sharp, soon sprinted well clear, given a breather through the turn, shaken up entering the stretch and was not threatened to the
wire under a firm hand ride. STAR SYZYGY broke back, lacked speed while racing well out in the strip, improved with a four wide move through the turn,
could do little with the winner the final furlong, remained clearly second best. BIG TAP BABY chased the winner early, continued in pursuit of that one out of
the turn, offered little resistance to the runner up nearing midstretch, saved the show. BUCK'S GLORY went one paced throughout in the two path in failing
to threaten. LITTLE STAR TARGET off slowly and remained back in failing to menace. LIFEASWEKNOWIT bobbled at the break, began to tire before three
furlongs. ST PIERRE off slowly, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
AMERICAN NIGHTMARE hustled clear along the inside the opening quarter, set a moderate pace while continuing inside, extended advantage far turn, not
threatened through the stretch under firm handling. DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE closest to the winner while in the two path early, continued to chase that one
the middle half mile, replaced in the second spot midway in the final turn, came back to retake that position while remaining off the inside, no real threat to
the winner. LEROY JENKINS well back off the early pace, improved with an inside middle move through the second turn, chased the winner in upper
stretch, flattened out to lose the place late, saved the show in the final strides. MATH MAN last away, trailed for over a half, came four wide into the stretch
when mounting a minor rally, lugged in past the furlong marker, slowly gaining for the third spot late. MUCHO VELOCE one paced while racing just of the
inside, continued in the two path and lacked a serious closing response. MONITOR MILLS four wide in the first turn when vying in the second flight tired
after five furlongs. CHAPEL OF DREAMS in the second group while three wide and between horses for a half, stopped.

Footnotes
MONZZA pressed the issue in the two path, dueled turn and into the lane, fell back a bit off the leader while drifting out slightly inside the furlong marker,
late surge between rivals to be up at the wire. HIGH RIDGE broke on top, narrowly set a pressured pace along the inside, continued to be hounded by the
winner into the stretch, held a narrow advantage late, nipped at the wire while narrowly holding the place while remaining closest to the inside of the first
flight. UNDERDOG lacked early foot off the inside, came three wide out of the turn, made a steady gain well out in the strip, narrowly missed the runner up
position late while outside the top two. QUANA DUDE off a step slow to be last away, trailed up the backstretch and through the turn, came four wide for the
drive, staged a mild rally to improve a bit. CUSTOM KAT went one paced toward the inside in lacking a closing response. FLASHBURN forwardly placed for
a half off the inside, gave way when the real running began at the head of the lane.

Footnotes
CHROME SAVAGE off the pace while outside, crept a bit closer three wide final turn, came four wide for the drive, dueled the final furlong while widest, dug
in late to narrowly prevail in game fashion. HIGH VALUE TARGET pressed the issue off the inside early, dueled backstretch, continued to apply pressure
through the final turn, three wide into the stretch, vied between rivals past the furlong grounds, dueled inside the winner to the wire, outkicked. K V
SQUARED in the second flight inside, moved closer with the winner late in the final turn, cut the corner into the lane, lacked a closing kick to prove no match
for the top two. MS. PRIESTLY set or forced the pace closest to the inside, held a narrow advantage into the lane int he two path, had little left in the run to
the wire. TRINITY QUEEN remained always back and was not a factor. HOT PATOOTIE forwardly placed early, began a steady fade before a half,
distanced stretch after losing contact with the field, walked in. HAIRTRIGGER HEART quickly fell back after the opening quarter, pulled up backstretch,
vanned off.
