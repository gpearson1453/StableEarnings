Footnotes
MUTTLEY engaged in taxing duel outside, led at the quarter pole, shook off that challenge then gamely held off late gainers. CLEAR CUT stalked the
dueling pacesetters then made a gradual late gain in final furlong. CUPID'S DART dropped back in the two path, moved wider in the stretch and closed well.
TWO COLOR MAP saved ground behind the dueling leaders and continued well. DRUNKEN BRIDGE lacked speed saving ground then flattened out in the
stretch. FLAG alternated for the advantage along the inside then weakened slightly. RECLUSE underwent a shoe repair in the paddock then raced very
wide during the running.

Footnotes
PYLON saved ground throughout then wore down the leaders through the final eighth and edged clear. SCORPION DYNASTY raced close up outside, bid
to the front into the stretch but was oiutfinished. KITH saved ground close up, angled out in the stretch then went evenly late. BUFFALO SHUFFLE broke
sluggishly, rushed to the front inside, was collared into the lane and weakened. WARRANT OFFICER dropped back early and narrowed the gap without
menacing. WILL TAKE CONTROL lacked speed along the inside and was never a factor. E T'S SUPER STAR lagged far behind and was never in
contention. ONE NINER TANGO chased three wide off the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
PRINCESS SOPHIE alternated for the lead in the two path, edged off in early stretch, ducked in a sixteenth out, was straightened and remained safe.
ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE rated outside, made a strong bid on the final turn then faded but offered a gradual late gain. COCO PUFF set a pressured pace
inside then proved empty in the stretch. PHANCY PHILLY was reserved inside the dueling leaders then began fading on the final turn. DECISIVE CAUSE
trailed early while unhurried, raced wide and lacked a rally. DOWSER prompted the leaders outside to the far turn then gave way. LA NEBLINA saved
ground within range then stopped along the inside.

Footnotes
JARLIAN raced close up in the two path, rallied into the stretch then pair of rivals safe on both sides. SPECTACULAR KID dueled outside and continued
gamely to the finish but could not hold off the winner. BUCKS ARE MOVING advanced quickly on the turn, was blocked and steadied at the quarter pole,
angled out splitting foes but was outfinished. THE METHOD saved ground off the leaders and lacked a rally. JUST A THOUGHT prompted the pace inside
to the far turn and faltered. MUSK raced off the pace outside and failed to menace. PRINCE CHAMP lagged far behind then closed the gap without
menacing. I SAW IT ALL earned a narrow advantage inside for half a mile and stopped.

ARRIVEDERCI vied briefly, drew clear before the half mile then widened under mild urging. KINGS HIGHWAY lacked speed inside then rallied well to gain
the place. MY MAN ELVIS saved ground off the leaders and continued well in the stretch. SIGHT LINE settled behind the pacesetters, moved wide in the
stretch and proved empty. GRIT AND GLORY prompted the winner for a quarter mile then faded on the final turn. CAPE MAY STYLE raced far behind
inside and was never in contention. PRETENDANT trailed throughout while soundly beaten.

ROSE LEGACY settled behind the dueling leaders, bid near the quarter pole and edged away while kept to a drive. DIANE'S COMET chased three wide
close up, rallied into the stretch but proved no match for the winner. GREEN SCREEN QUEEN moved just behind the pacesetters and lacked a rally.
ANGELOFTHEGALAXY dueled outside, took over before half a mile, led then weakened. CINNAMON DREAM dropped far back and was always outrun.

prompted the pace outside then came up empty in the stretch. TOMATER GATOR saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally. OWIN I AM dropped back
at the start and was never a factor. LAWN BOY (GB) roughed just after the break and always far back. BIG BAD BUD chased in the two path and began

MADAME ROUGE forced the pace under a hold, took over when ready at the three eighths pole held on gamely to the finish. SWEET BLAME stalked the
pacesetters wide, rallied into the stretch and finished willingly. OBSTINATE saved ground just off pace, raced in the two path on the final turn then went
evenly late. ELUSIVE RYDER broke slowest, raced near the inside, swung wide into the stretch with a mild bid. FED POLICY trailed along the inside early
and was never a factor. MARIANNA QUEEN was urged close up between foes before half a mile then faded. WONDER CITY moved easily to the lead
inside then was finished by the three eighths pole. ASSUME CONTROL chased very wide and retreated after half a mile.

Footnotes
LADY BERNADETTE vied three wide, took over into the far turn, moved clear and held rival safe through the stretch. SEA PINES well placed behind
dueling leaders, advanced on the turn, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. PRINCESS KAIRA trailed early, rallied very wide with good late
energy. LOVE THAT FACE raced wide down the backstretch then flattened out. MISS ALEX lacked speed then passed rivals without menacing.
MISBEHAVING LADY lagged far back and was never in contention. CAPE COD SALLY hustled to a narrow lead inside then gave way. ARDEAN saved
ground well behind and lacked a rally. UNIFIED RIDE raced within range off the leaders and faltered badly. SUPER SURGE dueled between rivals to the far
turn then gave way readily.
