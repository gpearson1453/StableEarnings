Footnotes
RELIABILITY was off a bit slow on the break, recovered nicely to be in front into the first turn, was well rated up front through the half, fought off a mild
charge at the top of the lane and drew away comfortably the final furlong. HELL BENT advanced on the fence down the backside to be in a good tracking
position into the far turn, rallied inside at the quarter pole, angled out to the three path with a furlong to go and finished up well between rivals closing to get
up for place. GREEN FLEET raced three wide throughout, rallied outside runners mid turn and ran on in the stretch to get up late for third. PRICELESS
WILL chased the leader through the beginning stages, offered a mild bid turning for home, was repelled by the frontrunning winner with an eighth to go and
weakened nearing the wire losing positions late. ARGENTIUM was allowed to settle at the back saving ground on the rail and could not get involved through
the stretch. GANCHO stalked between runners racing mid pack, was ridden to keep up through the far turn and retreated with a quarter to go.

Footnotes
FIELDER was urged forward from the start, set the pace racing near inside, went in the two path on the turn and faced pressure from DESTINIQUE, dueled
with that one late and under steady handling held that rival at bay. DESTINIQUE stalked three wide into the turn, edged closer to apply pressure to the
aforementioned, made a steady bid in late stretch dueling outside but missed. WENJACK stalked from outside going four wide on the turn, kept on to get
show honors. STORMY SOUL was forwardly-positioned three wide and between runners on the turn, kept on for a minor award over BAY OF RUM, who
tracked in behind the pace two wide, moved a bit nearer the rail into the turn, ran on evenly. EMICRACK (CHI) bumped with a rival a the start, angled in
early, saved ground on the turn, moved out five wide coming into upper stretch, gained willingly. FORESTER'S TURN hit the gate and was last while
spotting the field several lengths, saved ground inside on the turn, swung out seven wide coming into the stretch, was never near enough to threaten. KEEN
SAMURAI bumped with a rival at the start, was placed in tight quarters and brushed with a foe then steadied slightly after the opening sixteenth, went about
three to four wide on the turn swinging out nine deep out of that bend, ran on. ACE DESTROYER brushed with a foe and had to steady early, went two to
three wide on the turn, angled eight wide into the stretch, failed to menace. TALL WATER chased from between runners, was asked for more by the
five-sixteenths but had none and came up empty.

Footnotes
AWESOME BOURBON tracked the pace three wide outside of the frontrunners after the start, pounced on the leader with a quarter to go, fought on
determinedly while running to the finish and began to inch away late. SAMMY STONE was crowded on the break, bobbled leaving the chute to trail, angled
out for the drive in the six path and found his best stride late closing fast to get up at the finish for second money. KEEN FLATTER broke sharp to lead, then
tracked the pace for the first quarter, assumed command with five sixteenths to go, was headed by the winner outside two furlongs out, battled inside
through the stretch and gave way late losing place at the wire. UNCAPTURED MOMENT tracked between horses in the beginning stages of the race,
offered a mild rally in upper stretch and ran on with interest for a minor share. BONGINO exchanged bumps with outside runner following the break, was in
tight briefly into the backstretch, angled out at the quarter pole and passed a couple of tired runners through the lane. CELENTANO was hustled early to
take command down the backside, was headed mid turn while inside of horses and faded inside turning for home. FOUR K FORCE exchanged bumps with
inside rival soon after the start, was ridden to get rail position with three eighths to go, roused on the fence through the turn and weakened at the top of the
stretch.

Footnotes
HOLYFIELD dueled inside a rival on or just off the rail, drifted out into upper stretch while beginning to edge away, drew clear. BET N WIN broke outwardly
bumping a rival and in turn was bumped by foe at the start, tracked inside saving ground just off the leaders, came out a path late on the far turn, moved up
inside to secure the place in late stretch. NONNO'S LITTLE BOY settled between runners two to three wide early, moved between rivals late on the far turn,
angled six wide into upper stretch, ran on to get up for show honors. COMMANDER JOE stalked off the leading pair four to five wide, made a brief bid on
the far turn, lost third late. AWESOMECREST was bumped and then bumped that rival at the start, shifted in to save ground on the first turn racing off the
pace, ran on evenly. MEN ON THE HILL (IRE) raced outside toward the back three to four wide early, advanced four then six wide on the far turn but could
not sustain the effort. MORNING THOUGHTS was two to three wide early, encouraged along three to five wide on the far turn, failed to rally. LAMENT
dueled outside two to three wide, gave way late on the far turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off. MASTER MCGRATH was pinballed at the
break and never in it, eased through the stretch and walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, BET N WIN WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED NINTH BEHIND MASTER MCGRATH FOR INTERFERENCE.

Footnotes
WAR COURT settled well down the backside just behind two pressing frontrunners, was nudged along going three wide entering the stretch to take the lead
and was kept to the task in the final furlong to hold off a mild outside challenge. TARANTO TITAN broke out at the start, inched his way up on the rail
entering the far turn to contend, had to wait briefly to angle out turning for home and could not catch the winner who got the jump on him in upper stretch.
SPRING MOUNTAIN settled outside mid pack after the start, was asked while three wide through the far turn, wandered through the lane but was focused
enough the get up for third at the wire. FACTOTUM led on the rail until the far turn, then was collared at the quarter pole and backed away on the fence in
the stretch while still holding on to be a fringe player. LARAQUE was three wide into the first turn, pressed the leader through the backside, briefly lead
between rivals with a quarter to go and tired the last eighth. COLLABORATIVE settled near the rear after the break, was ridden on the rail through the far
turn, angled out in upper stretch and was one paced to the finish. ROBITAILLE trailed in the beginning and could not get into contention throughout.

Footnotes
P H FACTOR got away alertly, moved clear and shifted in to dictate terms near the inside, asked in upper stretch, widened while being kept to the task.
SOCIETY JOE steadied after the start when in tight, moved to the rail, saved ground, advanced inside on the far turn, was no match for the winner but
clearly second best. STREET LEGAL tracked the winner from inside early, put to urging late on the far turn having gone two then three wide on that bend
and within striking range, could not kick on with the top ones but saved show honors. SELF INFLICTED was in tight after the break, settled at the rear near
the inside, swung six wide turning for home, ran on but missed show honors. GUITAR GEORGE raced just off the pace two to three wide early, advanced
three then four wide on the far turn, lacked the needed late kick in the stretch. MESA SKYLINE settled outside three to four wide early off the leaders, was
ridden along three wide on the far turn but failed to rally. D'S BEN came in after the break then switched outside the pacesetter to pursue that one two to
three wide, had no response when asked on the far turn, dropped back, was eased through the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
DUN DRUM made a bold move advancing around runners travelling four wide through the far turn, took the lead turning for home, opened up briefly in
upper stretch and had enough in the late stages to hold off a closing runner at the wire. DOLDER GRAND tracked the pacesetters inside with a half to go,
had to wait behind runners at the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch four wide and was inching closer to the winner with every stride but could not get
there. CONGLOMERATE raced three wide through to the half, with a quarter to run was shuffled back a bit while in between horses and ran on through the
stretch to get third at the wire. FULL EXTREME settled near the rear in the beginning, angled off the fence on the far turn circling runners at the top of the
stretch, had a clear run in the seven path turning for home and finished with some interest to get a minor share. A THREAD OF BLUE chased the
pacesetter throughout until the quarter pole where he briefly took command, only to quickly be swallowed up by outside runners and retreated between
rivals nearing the wire losing positions late. GUESTIMATION broke well to take command early, led with a quarter to go when collared by outside horses
and faded on the fence in the run through the lane. SIR SAHIB moved up the fence through the far turn and could not offer a finish between runners through
the final furlong. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE trailed early and never made a presence. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION took a stalking position near the rear, was
roused on the far turn and showed little. DREAM MAKER was in tight first, behind runners into the first turn, then down the backside between rivals, ridden
in the far turn and offered no response.

Footnotes
WAR BOMBER (IRE) got away alertly, set the pace inside on or just off the rail, drifted out leaving the second turn, met the challenge of an outside rival in
upper stretch then re-emerged with a clear lead in mid- to late-stretch and held from the late rally of ARTIE'S STORM, who exchanged a minor brush in the
early going, settled at the rear racing off the inside, began to advance five wide into the stretch, was gaining but too late. CLAYTON stalked outside the
winner two to three wide, edged closer turning for home coming into upper stretch four wide and making a brief bid about the three-sixteenths, was turned
back about the eighth pole and settled for show. FROSTED OVER shifted in on the first turn and saved ground, advanced some still inside early on the far
turn angling out six wide leaving that bend, ran on evenly. CASH DIVIDEND saved ground racing inside through the first turn, switched out early up the
backstretch and went about two wide on the far turn, asked for run past the three-eighths, angled out in the stretch and ran on. SPECIAL FORCES lacked
early speed despite encouragement, raced three to five wide through both turns and failed to menace. CARROTHERS exchanged a light brush early then
was in tight quarters entering the first turn dropping back early on that bend and racing three wide, switched out once in the backstretch racing four wide into
the far turn, weakened and drifted in a bit in the stretch. TAP IT TO WIN was forwardly-positioned outside into the first turn going three to four wide,
encouraged along on the far turn still off the inside but had no response and weakened.

SISTER SEAGULL was allowed to settle early to trail, advanced inside of runners at the half to contend into the far turn, roused on the fence at the quarter
pole, found a seam in mid stretch to split runners and finished strongest of all in the last sixteenth. STREGA led from the onset, was well rated through the
far turn, repelled a mild challenge in upper stretch to open up with an eighth to run, but could not hold off the winner late that was closing well between
horses. PIONEER'S EDGE raced three wide in the beginning stages, commenced her rally around runners with five sixteenths to go, loomed boldly in upper
stretch and could not quicken enough with a furlong out to threaten the top two finishers. SOUPER FLASHY trailed the fillies down the backside, was roused
midway on the far turn travelling four wide to be in contention turning for home and could not find enough late outside settling for a minor share. LADY
BREW tracked the pacesetter into the first turn and through the backstretch, was ridden between runners nearing the quarter pole and faded in the late
stages of the race.

Footnotes
DOTTED LINE was bumped at the break, shifted in and moved forward between foes to set the pace racing about two wide, faced pressure from an inside
rival into the turn, maintained a narrow advantage on that one dueling to the wire while under all out urging. EPILOGUE was forwardly-positioned pressing
inside into the turn, still under a hold early on that bend, put to urging turning for home, dueled inside but was held off and missed. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS
shifted in heading up the backstretch, saved ground inside rivals on then just off the rail through the turn, ran on to secure show honors while no threat to
the top pair. TIMESKIP bumped a rival at the break, raced very wide early while being coerced into moving back in, went five wide on the turn advancing on
the leaders past the three-eighths but leveled off in the drive. IKERRIN ROAD (IRE) got away well then settled off the leaders to stalk, went four wide into
the turn, moved out eight wide out of that bend, failed to rally. DECIMATOR switched outside a rival up the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn,
failed to threaten.

Footnotes
BOHEMIAN BOY took command after the break, settled comfortably up front through the turn, opened up with a quarter to go and just had enough left in the
tank to hold on narrowly at the wire. DOWNY BOY settled just behind the frontrunners through the turn, was roused at the top of the lane, angled off the
fence for his run, split runners in deep stretch and just missed getting up for the victory. NASHTRICK waited just outside of runners not far off the pace
around the turn, angled out to the six path for a clear run and finished strong gaining steadily in the final eighth to just be beaten in a three horse photo.
RON'S GIZMO hit the gate at the start, recovered to settle mid pack on the fence into the turn, angled out to the three path for the drive, lost path through
the last eighth but still ran on determinedly to get a small share. BASKETBALL JONES settled mid pack running through the turn, was roused on the fence
in upper stretch and finished with some late energy to pass tiring rivals in the final eighth. WORKIN OUT pressed the early pace through the turn, offered a
mild bid turning for home and weakened between runners with a furlong to go. DESOLATOR was ridden to go after runners at the top of the lane and
offered little response. BIG EXECUTIVE tracked outside on the turn, offered a brief bid at the quarter pole, began to weaken in mid stretch and was not
persevered with late. DRAGON'S BREW was near the back and could not get involved. EMBRACE MY UNCLE trailed and was never a factor.
