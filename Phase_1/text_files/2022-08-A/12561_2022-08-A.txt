Footnotes
BIG HOPES was off slow from inside, unhurried in the early going, continued along the rail then tipped out, rallied outside the leaders and got up at the wire.
FUN MONEY broke well, went up to duel for command from outside, put away inner rival at the top of the stretch then met the bid from ORGANIC, drifted
out at the eighth pole, battled into the final sixteenth and got nailed at the wire. JUST A LITTLE LUCK broke well and showed early speed inside the top
pair, dropped back to chase past the half-mile pole, traveled along the inside then took aim two wide entering the lane, got boxed in between rivals and
behind the leader in upper stretch, gained a clear path with a furlong left to run and finished gamely from inside for the show. ORGANIC broke out and
bumped rival, moved into range while pulling the rider along on the backstretch, was driven three wide into the stretch, bid outside the leader and got floated
out at the eighth pole, dueled into the final sixteenth and faltered in the late stages. ROSIE ANN RULES broke well then dropped back off the rail, went four
then five wide on the turn and never threatened. SMOOVE AS SILK got bumped from inside at the start, received a bumped from outside chasing off the rail
early on, angled to the rail on the turn, moved back out and came three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. SMOKIN CHEENA challenged early for
command between rivals then dueled inside the winner, fought with that rival into and around the turn, failed to keep up at the top of the stretch and
weakened. THANK YOU KERA broke a step slow, went five wide into the turn, got floated out a bit further leaving the bend, angled inside a rival entering
the stretch and never got involved. ARTEMIS STAR broke a step slow, raced widest of all up the backstretch, entered the turn six wide, came seven wide
into the stretch and had little left for the drive. PRETTY THIRSTY was off slow and got bumped at the start, drifted in and bumped rival in the early stages,

Footnotes
CITY RAGE raced in mid-pack early, rounded the bend five wide, rallied and reached the front with a sixteenth to go and prove best in the end. REDLINE
settled near the back well off the rail, traveled six wide through the turn, closed widest in the lane and got up for second. CRASH CORRIGAN broke well but
dropped back when lacking early quickness, moved closer up the backstretch, traveled along the rail then tipped out leaving the bend, rallied between in the
final sixteenth but got outkicked by the top pair. GOOD VIBES ONLY cleared early and showed the way up the backstretch, set all the pace two wide to the
stretch, remained clear into the final furlong but clung to a narrow lead with a sixteenth to go and yielded in deep stretch. RHETORIC chased the pacesetter
while outside a rival, traveled four wide through the turn and lacked the needed late kick in the furlong grounds. CEES GET DEGREES drifted out early then
was forwardly placed chasing the lone leader, traveled three wide around the bend and weakened. SUBSIDIZE raced near the back then trailed early on,
went two wide into the turn, angled over to the rail and failed to menace.

Footnotes
COUNT OF AMAZONIA (IRE) unhurried on the inside in the beginning, went two then three wide on the far turn, angled widest in the lane, rallied to the front
at the sixteenth pole and drew clear. SHADOW SPHINX broke a step slow and got brushed early, dropped back and raced outside a rival, lacked room
entering the stretch, steed to the inside, rallied up the fence and gained the place. FIRST PREMIO pulled on the inside stalking the pace early, waited for
room on the far turn, lacked room from the top of the stretch to the eighth pole, found room between runners and finished willingly but got edged for the
place. NEPTUNE'S STORM was off a bit slow to begin, went three wide around both turns outside rivals, moved out in the stretch, bid six deep in the
stretch but lacked the needed late punch. IT'S MY HOUSE sped to the front and moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch, resisted to the sixteenth pole
and yielded late. SOLO ANIMO pulled early then settled into a stalking position in the two path outside a rival, took aim three wide into the stretch, bid three
deep in upper stretch but flattened late. NILES CHANNEL broke awkwardly, steadied off heels early on the first turn, traveled along the inside at the back,
raced in tight between and paused at the quarter pole, angled out into the stretch and failed to menace. CONO broke well from outside then angled into the
two path and rated in hand, bid from outside and fought to the sixteenth pole then weakened. COAST OF ROAN was off slow and bumped between rivals at
the start, traveled between rivals or two wide early, raced in mid-pack through the middle stages, chased to wide into the lane, lacked room behind rivals
through the lane and had to steady and was too late to regain momentum. SEATTLE BOLD settled two wide then moved inside on the first turn, cut the
corner into the stretch, got put in tight by SHADOW SPHINX and had to steady at the eighth pole and weakened.

Footnotes
GOING GLOBAL (IRE) staked in the two path early on, drew alongside the top pair with a quarter mile left to run, took over at the three-sixteenths pole,
kicked clear and drew away under urging. AVENUE DE FRANCE (FR) settled along the inside, tipped two wide on the far turn, angled out further in the lane
and finished willingly but could not threaten the winner. JAVANICA away alertly, cleared and moved to the inside, controlled the pace to the far turn,
challenged from outside around the bend, lost command at the three-sixteenths pole and saved the show. BURGOO ALLEY (IRE) tracked off the rail
leaving the chute, went three wide around the clubhouse turn, stalked outside a rival, drew alongside the leader on the far turn, vied between leaving the
bend, flattened in the stretch and got edged for the show. ROCKING REDHEAD was off slow to begin, unhurried early and moved to the two path, got
crowded between rivals past the five-sixteenths pole, exited the bend three deep and could not rally. FLIPPANT reserved in the early going, went three deep
into the far turn, four deep late on the bend and also lacked a rally. PARK AVENUE up close three wide leaving the chute then rated in the two path, waited
for room on the far turn and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
CAVE ROCK got bumped from outside at the start, set the pace up the backstretch, padded the lead around the turn, coaxed lightly in upper stretch and
drew off easily while coasting in late. PRACTICAL MOVE lost his path and steadied at the start, tracked off the inside, spun four wide into the lane and was
clearly second best. ABELIEFINTHISLIVIN brushed with a rival early, chased off the rail and three wide into the drive and lacked a bid. ULTIMATE
GAMBLE closest in pursuit early on, went two wide into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend and weakened. TALL BOY bumped between rivals early,
chased three to four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. ALEXANDER HELIOS stumbled and bumped at the start, chased along the inside then two wide
into the drive and failed to menace. STOP AND A TRES sat off the pace up the backstretch, went four to five wide on the turn and continued wide into the
stretch and weakened. EL PERFECTO bobbled and broke in, began to climb and was taken out wide on the backstretch, raced wide through the turn and
was never a factor. SHIP AND SCAM got bumped between rivals early, angled down to the inside from off the pace, moved out and entered the lane two to
three wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
DANDY WARHOL (IRE) broke a step slow and bumped with inner rival, unhurried in the two path early, coaxed three wide into the stretch, angled out in the
lane and got up in time. HANDY DANDY raced in the two path near the back, remained two wide into the stretch, steered to the inside and launched a rail
rally, took over past the sixteenth pole but got caught on the line. DEGREE OF RISK raced two wide off the pace on the first turn then three deep into the
backstretch, remained three wide into the lane, rallied but got outclosed by the top pair. ANMER HALL raced along the inside then moved out into the
backstretch, traveled two to three wide into the lane, rallied but lacked the needed late kick. BALLADEER sent for the lead from inside, opened up a large
lead early, remained well clear to the stretch, held a diminished lead entering the furlong grounds, reeled in by rivals with a sixteenth to go and yielded.
SYDNEY STREET (GB) was off slow to begin and bumped with outside rival, allowed to settle on the inside, tipped out into the stretch, angled out further in
the lane but failed to menace. OPTIMISING (IRE) traveled on the inside near the back, lacked room past the quarter pole, tipped out upper stretch and
made no impact. NERO TULIP (GB) stalked in the two path then moved inside, raced in a bit tight inside a rival on the far turn, lacked room at the
thee-sixteenths pole and weakened. SHOW TIME was closest in pursuit to the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
VEGAS MAGIC stalked the pacesetter on the inside into the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, drew alongside PROCRASTINATION approaching the
sixteenth pole and drove past. PROCRASTINATION took control from inside quickly, set the pace in the two path into the turn then moved to the inside, put
to left-handed urging in upper stretch, held a short lead entering the final sixteenth, could not hold the winner at bay but finished gamely to the wire.
DAZZLINGDOMINIKA raced up close outside the leader early, chased two to three wide on the turn and into the lane, had the rider lose his whip midstretch,
was no match for the top pair but kept on for a clear third. SATIN DOLL brushed leaving the gate, tracked between rivals then two wide into the stretch and
lacked a bid. CLASSYMADEMOISELLE brushed with SATIN DOLL leaving the gate, climbed while racing greenly on the backstretch, took a bad step at the
seven-sixteenths pole, raced off the rail through the turn and failed to menace. ABSOLUTELY ZERO broke a step slow from outside, raced greenly up the
backstretch while chasing outside rivals, came three wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SEVEN WONDERS was a bit fractious in the gate, settled off the rail then angled in first time through the stretch, angled three wide on the far turn, tipped
out further in the lane, rallied three deep late and proved best. SPYCATCHER stalked in the two path early, waited on the inside through the far turn, gained
an opening next to the fence at the top of the stretch, rallied and gained second. IRISH PROPHET tracked four wide leaving the chute then moved to the
two path, tipped three wide and bid outside the leaders on the far turn, took over in upper stretch, cleared briefly and was outkicked by the top pair.
NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) settled off the rail then moved inside for the first turn, taken off the rail on the backstretch, went two wide into the far turn,
angled four wide while moving closer on the far turn but needed to find more in the final furlong. PRAY FOR ME RAY was off a bit slow, dropped back and
angled in early, raced two wide near the back, steered out and came five wide into the stretch and improved position. PERCOLATE (IRE) settled off the
pace, went three deep into the far turn, angled out to the five path leaving the bend and lacked further response. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT unhurried and
moved to the inside, saved ground throughout and never threatened. TOKAMAK sped clear early in the two path then moved inside, held a short lead
through the far turn and into the stretch, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. RIO KING bumped leaving the gate, trailed early, swung six wide
into the stretch and came up empty. NEW YORK DREAMS (GB) fractious in the gate, broke slow, pulled early and up the backstretch, paused at the quarter
pole, lacked room into the stretch and could not rally in the drive. DEVIL MOON bumped with RIO KING at the start, was a bit rank six wide entering the
stretch for the first time, went three wide on the clubhouse turn then applied pressure outside the leader lost touch intermittently on the backstretch before
challenging around the far turn but faded down the lane.
