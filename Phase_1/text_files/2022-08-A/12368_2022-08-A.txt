ACALTEQUE Tracked along the two path, moved to take on the leader at the furlong marker, battled that one and under pressure edged clear.
LOHENGRIN TWO Set the pace along the rail, was collared at the furlong marker, battled on to no avail but held the place. SAMAY Ducked out at the start,
four wide on the turn, angled wide and rallied. SMOKIN' ALONE Close up early, dropped back along the three path on the turn, angled wide and made a
mild bid. SIMBASALLTROUBLE In hand along the rail, made a bit of move into the lane and weakened. WAR OF THRONES Lagged far back, saved
ground, was not a factor. SMOOTH TALES Tracked along the three path, continued in striking distance in upper stretch and faded. BOWING SNOWMAN
Five wide into the turn, four wide around and finished wide.
