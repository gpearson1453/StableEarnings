pace along the rail, could not match strides with the winner from the quarter pole but stayed on well to hold second. STRAND OF GOLD settled off the early
pace inside, angled out early on the backstretch, raced in range four wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and was lugging in
throughout the stretch run. CLOUD STORAGE pressed the pace two wide, reached even terms between foes nearing the quarter pole and tired in the lane.

while racing two wide.

between foes in the lane but lost second late. AWESOME IDENTITY was shut off at the start, raced off the pace four wide and had a mild stretch gain. MILK

Footnotes
EASY COME EASY GO tracked the pace two wide, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths pole, steadily gained in the lane, took over near the sixteenth
pole and drove clear. SOUL OF AN ANGEL saved ground off the pace, swung five wide near the quarter pole and rallied outside. KAEKO was bumped at
the start, stalked the pace three wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, led to the sixteenth marker and weakened late. NO DECAF was rank and
bumped KAEKO at the start but sill sped to the front, set the pace along rail while appearing to try to get out and tired in the lane. PUPPET MASTER played
no factor while racing four wide. MISZLO was outrun while racing three wide. DIVINE CONNECTION pressed the pace two wide and retreated through the
stretch. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
MAGIC BOMB settled off the pace while racing two wide, split rivals near the quarter pole, closed determinedly and was up in deep stretch. THE BEAST
dueled two wide, drew clear midway around the turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch and led until deep stretch. CAN'T BE BROKEN stalked the pace
three wide, had aim outside of the top two through the stretch and was one-paced through the lane. CANDENZA raced off the pace two wide and had a mild
stretch rally. NIPPON was off a bit slowly, raced three wide and had a mild belated rally. REGIO failed to menace while racing five wide. CORPORATE
AFFAIR set the early pace along the rail and retreated around the turn. MINISTER QUINN steadied early, raced in range four wide around the turn, drifted
out entering the stretch and faltered. MICAWBER broke slowly and trailed inside.
