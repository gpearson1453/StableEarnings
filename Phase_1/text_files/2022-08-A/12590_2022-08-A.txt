FLASHY GEM set the pace, was coaxed from inside into the stretch, rebroke at the top of the lane, and drew clear. WHAT AN HONOR stalked from the
three path, ranged up three wide around the far turn, but evened out to place. BELLA MAKER was well back in the three path, was ridden three wide around
the far turn, tipped into the five path in upper stretch, and kept on to show. BECK AND CALL chased in the two path, swung into the four path coming into
the stretch, but was one paced. BASILICA D ORO tracked inside, was cued while saving ground into the stretch, but weakened. KILLING TIME prompted
the pace from the two path but faded into the stretch. KEY TO SUCCESS rated along the inside but was no threat. GRAY FROST trailed and was no
menace. MORIARTY raced in midpack from the three path but dropped out early, was pulled up, and walked off. MORIARTY WALKED OFF

late. SHOPLIFTER chased inside, was driven from the four path into the stretch, and improved position. HOLIDAY DECISION pressed from two wide but
gave way in the final furlong. CRACKALACKING sat the pocket, was cued while saving ground into the lane, but faded. KISS ME ON OCONEE broke out,

Footnotes
STEAL SUNSHINE trailed early, was driven from two wide into the lane, shifted in and rallied up the inside to win. ROME led in the two path, was coaxed
around the far turn, drifted out to the four path in upper stretch, and held place. STRAVA rated from the three path, fanned out to the seven path into the
stretch, and improved. CHASING TIME tracked from three wide, was floated out to the six path at the top of the stretch, but flattened. TRADEMARK raced
in midpack from the three path, tipped into the six path into the stretch, but finished evenly. KNOCKER DOWN chased four wide, was driven from the four
path into lane, but was empty. FRIAR LAURENCE stalked inside, was hustled from inside rounding the far turn, but faded. TOP OF THE CHARTS pressed
from the two path but was done rounding the far turn. WE ALL SEE IT raced from well back in the three path and was no factor.
