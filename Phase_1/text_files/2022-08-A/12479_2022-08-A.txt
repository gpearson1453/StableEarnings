GOOSE DRANK WINE was hustled to a clear lead and drew off in late stretch under a hand ride. WRATH broke well to take an early lead then settled off
the pace and chased the winner home. SWINGIN' SAM raced back early made a three wide bid on the turn then moved out four wide in upper stretch to
rally for the show. DANCE FOR RANSOM tracked the leaders from the three path down the backstretch then move to the inside on the turn but was empty
in the stretch drive. MERRY MIX UP was always back.

Footnotes
BARLOWS PRIDE had brief foot then tracked the leader from the two path through the turn and engaged the leader at the eighth pole and sailed home
under medium urging. JONO sprinted to the lead from the inside, was headed at the eighth pole but came up empty in the drive to prove second best.
CRUZ'N OLLIE stalked the pace from the two path to the turn then move out to three wide to make a bid at the leaders and flattened out. HOT ARTIE was
placed off the pace while saving ground but was one paced. FRIENDLY FOE raced in the middle of the pack from the three path giving an even effort.
RANCHER was unhurried early and was never a threat. KEARNEY raced near the back and was not a factor.
