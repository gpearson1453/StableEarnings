ALOHA BREEZE came in leaving the chute, prompted pace inside, engaged Miss Dynamic on the turn, opened clear nearing the stretch, quickly drew clear
and won with something left. DRIVEWAY dropped back early while saving ground, slipped through during the drive and finished full of run. MISS DYNAMIC
broke in to bump with Grazed n' Confused, then moved up to duel for the lead from along the outside to the stretch and tired. ASK ALICE steadied leaving
the chute when Aloha Breeze came in, then was unhurried, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. STARRY BEACH dropped back
early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. GRAZED N' CONFUSED was bumped at the start by Miss Dynamic, then showed speed to
the turn and gave way. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A REVIEW INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE, BUT AFTE VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO
CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

FIRE ESCAPE sprinted clear early, saved ground setting the pace and was ridden out to increase her advantage. AWESOME DAZE saved ground while
being forwardly place, slipped through during the drive and finished strongly. BIG FASHION chased the winner throughout and held on well in a good effort.
TYCHE AWAITS YOU dropped back early, saved ground and gained her best stride too late. SMILING SALSA came five-wide into the stretch but lacked a
rally. MS PARKSIDE broke out and then was shuffled back, moved up three-wide on the backstretch to reach contention before going a quarter mile, was
prominent into the stretch and tired from her early efforts. MO CONNELLY dropped back early and showed little.

IT'S TURBO saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, steadied briefly in tight nearing the eighth pole then slipped through along the inside and
was up in the final sixteenth. CHUCKANUT BAY dueled for the lead from along the inside, drifted out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole, responded
during the drive and held on gamely to the wire. J C'S A LEGEND prompted the issue from the outset while three-wide but wasn't quite good enough in
game effort. SUPERMAX was never far back, came three-wide into the stretch to offer a bid and then went evenly late. DESHAMBEAU bobbled at the start
to get away behind his field, moved up three-wide to reach a forward position but gave way after three furlongs. MISTER MIDAS disputed the pace for a half
mile from between horses and stopped.

Footnotes
MISSED THE BOAT stalked the paced racing in hand, came three-wide into the stretch and finished fast to be up in the final strides. STAND TO prompted
the pace from along the outside, took the lead approaching the eighth pole, opened a clear advantage but was unable to resist the winner late. HEREDIA
BOXER bobbled at the start, saved ground on the turn angled out to be three-wide entering the stretch and was gaining ground late. DUTTON saved ground
setting the pressured pace into the stretch and weakened late. MAKAH LANE dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
WINDRIBBON was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch but had no response when called upon.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF LUCK saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, moved forward along the inside in the stretch, altered course to the outside nearing
the sixteenth pole and was up in the final strides. THE METAL MAN dueled with Dusalut for the lead from along the inside, shook that one off nearing the
eighth pole but was unable to resist the winner late. NORSKI saved ground while being unhurried early, rallied along the inside into the stretch and finished
full of run. ORCADIAN STORM hopped at the start, then moved up along the outside to stalk the pace, was four-wide the final quarter mile and lacked a
rally. MISO FAST dropped back early, raced three-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DUSALUT vied for the lead from
along the outside to the stretch and tired.
