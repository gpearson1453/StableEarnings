BOLD LEGEND dueled outside of AUTUMN ASPEN for the early lead and continued to battle into the lane, dug in under firm handling past the furlong
marker, shook free and edged away. AUTUMN ASPEN dueled inside of BOLD LEGEND for the lead in opening stages and continued to battle for command
into the lane, failed to match strides with eventual winner past mid-stretch and held place. IRISH CONTESSA raced up close in the opening quarter and
chased three wide around the turn, sustained response into the lane and ran on for a share. GOODNIGHTSUGAR was not too far back along the outside
heading into the turn, swung five wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. STERN tracked the pace four wide around the turn then faded in the
lane.

ARIZONA ANDREW sped to the lead soon after the start and showed the way around the turn, saved ground entering the lane and kept clear under a mild
drive. PINCH ME A PENNY chased three wide around the turn, sustained bid into the lane and finished second best. OCEAN OF STORMS saved ground
around the turn, hustled along the rail at the head of the lane, edged closer then ran on evenly in deep stretch and just lasted for show. GUSTAVO raced
four wide in range around the turn, coaxed three to four wide in upper stretch and just missed show. RUDIANO was forwardly placed around the turn then
weakened in the lane. DREADPIRATEROBERTS steadied between rivals entering the turn, dropped back and had no late response.

LEGENDARY GIFT dueled inside of WINZE for the lead through the backstretch, shook free entering the far turn, widened to a clear advantage in upper
stretch and kept to task under steady urging. SWEET LAURA was reserved racing in the back, circled up into contention mid-way around the far turn,
sustained a three wide bid for the winner through the lane and finished clearly second best. XCARET rated off the embattled duo through the backstretch,
launched a two wide bid around the far turn and ran on for a share. BEER EMPRESS tracked the early pace along the inside, chased in contention around
the far turn then gave way. WINZE dueled with the eventual winner through the backstretch and came up empty mid-way around the final turn.
RUNNINGONTHETAFUEL settled in good position and tracked the top pair through the backstretch then came up empty three furlongs out.

OLD TRAFFORD chased the leader along the inside then tipped three wide for the drive, stayed on determinedly in pursuit of FEARLESS WILL and edged
away in deep stretch. FEARLESS WILL set the pace into the turn, widened to clear advantage a furlong out, lugged in under a left handed drive and got
edged out late. O'L RED was forwardly placed soon after the start, was ridden two to three wide around the turn and stayed on for a share. MURDO lacked
speed and raced in the back, swung five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. TRUE SAINT raced off the top trio in early stages, chased three wide
around the turn then flattened in the lane.

Footnotes
JERRYS PRIDENJOY prompted the early pace along the inside, urged along the rail around the far turn, took over the lead in upper stretch and held late
under a driving finish. SMOKIN BOOTS was off slow at the start and raced in the back, picked up the tempo midway around the far turn, swung five wide
into the lane, rallied while moving inward, finished gamely and closed fast on the winner. COOL CAT CHARLIE stalked the pace through the backstretch,
launched a four wide bid around the far turn, ran on into the lane and prevailed for a share. SEAZAN raced near midpack, urged two wide around the far
turn, angled inside at the head of the lane and ran on evenly in final stages. MOON IN THE SKY raced off the early pace, hustled along three wide midway
around the far turn and lacked a rally. HUMERO D'ORO tracked the early pace then took over the lead entering the far turn, got collared in upper stretch,
weakened and got vanned off after the race. WENT set a pressured pace through the backstretch then faded around the final turn. MONSIEUR BROWN
raced off the pace and steadily retreated. OPLIN came up empty past the half mile marker and jogged in.

and finished ridden out. SAMIRA hustled up along the rail, cut the corner into the lane, sustained inside bid and finished second best. OLIVE OYL raced
three deep in the last flight entering the turn, coaxed three wide in upper stretch and got up late for show. SABRIA raced in the last flight, chased four wide
around the turn, drifted out six wide entering the lane and lacked a rally. DEMIDANU raced three wide in contention around the turn then weakened in the
lane. PEGGY RULES was not too far back heading into the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and lacked a rally. DAMASCUS GATE raced up close
three to four wide around the turn and tired in the drive.

ALLEN'S ROCKET tracked the top trio through the backstretch, moved up three wide and took over the lead approaching the quarter pole, widened to a
clear advantage in upper stretch and kept to task under steady urging. SHIPS ON FIRE was allowed to settle off the early pace, began to edge closer five
wide late on the final turn, swung six wide into the lane, rallied along the outside and gained place. FINISH UP raced near mid-range through the
backstretch, launched a four wide bid around the far turn, stayed on five wide into upper stretch and gained show. BIG PINES SANDY rated near midpack,
chased inside around the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane and flattened in final furlong. MY BOBBY MCGEE settled through early stages, hustled up
two wide around the final turn, sustained two wide run into the lane but needed more for late impact. JUSTICE ONCE raced off the early pace, urged along
the rail entering the lane then hit a wall of horses, lacked a clear path then gave way. SEMI CHARMED DAY set the pace through the backstretch, got
collared by the winner at the quarter pole and gave way. A BRUSH OF LUCK was forwardly placed around the first turn then edged back to sit just off the
early pace, coaxed three to four wide around the far turn and failed to kick on in the lane. LATE FOR LUNCH raced just off the pacesetter through the
backstretch, remained three wide in contention around the far turn then faded. MIDNIGHT RULES raced five wide into the first turn and failed to move into
contention.
