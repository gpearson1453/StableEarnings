Footnotes
RUNAWAY HARRY was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, edged clear on the far turn, widened that
advantage racing into upper stretch and was taken in hand in late stages once the issue was decided. ARIES REIGNS was rated off the second flight
between foes in the opening half, angled inside entering the far turn while gaining some position, tipped three wide entering the stretch and prevailed for the
place honors. BACK TO SELLING was rated outside foes behind the second flight to the backstretch, readily gained position racing three wide into the far
turn but had no final bid. CALZONE was firmly rated off the second flight while angling inwards racing to the backstretch, then continued evenly into the
stretch. SWAMPDRAINER tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the far turn and came up empty entering the stretch. WESTPORT
CAPTAIN tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight and retreated racing into the far turn. DASTARDLY DEEDS settled last to the backstretch and
proved no threat. TAIL OF SAMSON, forwardly placed prompting the eventual winner to the backstretch, emptied out after a half.

second best. MOLLY'S ANGEL chased the pace from the inside into the far turn to rally in the early stretch but it was too little too late. HOTASAPISTOL
chased the pace while two wide on the backstretch, was moving up to rally on the second turn but came up evenly in the stretch. COME ON SWEET PEA
tracked the pace from the inside, was in a hard drive on the far turn, was used up and stopped.

PERFECT DUDE was off slowly, then was unhurried early, was gaining ground steadily heading into the second turn, dug in gamely while five wide and
surged down the stretch to be up at the wire in the final strides. SONNY SMACK chased the pace from the inside, was well rated on the backstretch, then
rallied three wide on the second turn, drifted in towards the rail in upper stretch, cut off rival then continued to close strong down the lane. MY INDY set the
pace along the rail, was in a long drive, vied to keep the lead on the far turn then faltered in the stretch. PINTXOS raced in the middle of the field while four
wide, then rallied three wide to vie for the lead on the second turn but came up evenly in the stretch. MAJOR ATTRACTION settled along the inside then bid
in upper stretch but was cut off by an outer rival and lost momentum. NORTHCUT chased the pace while two wide, was in a steady drive then vied for the
lead on the second turn, was used up and tired in the lane. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE was unhurried early and no factor. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY
and JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following the race.The jockey of MAJOR ATTRACTION claimed foul against the jockey of SONNY SMACK for interference in
the upper stretch. After reviewing the replay, SONNY SMACK was disqualified and placed fifth.

LOVE THE NEST stalked the leader while two wide, was in a steady drive, gained command heading into the far turn, menaced gamely in early stretch and
just lasted to the wire to prove best. COUSVINNYSACANUCK was reserved on the backstretch, then was moving up to rally three wide on the second turn
and closed well down the lane and was second best. BENS MALICE was allowed to settle on the back stretch, then came out four wide on the far turn to
rally in the stretch but it was too little too late. XAVEY DAVE raced in the middle of the field in the two path, then made a mild bid on the far turn into the
home stretch but it was not enough. DOCTOR OSCAR showed the way from the inside on the first turn, was in a long drive, was headed by an outer rival at
the five sixteenths pole, then continued to bid entering the stretch, was used up and weakened. NORTH ARM BAY was unhurried early then bid mildly while
four wide on the far turn into the stretch and was no threat. HAPPY HOUR BOBBY tracked the pace while wide then dropped back slightly on the
backstretch, came on again, was in tight at the top of the far turn and dropped back and was no menace. COLOR ME LEGENDARY tracked the pace from
the inside then faded entering the second half of the course and needed more.

Footnotes
IT'S HER TIME was in a steady drive while stalking the pace in the two path, then gained command at the three eighths pole, drew clear in the upper stretch
and was held to task proving best. HONEY BELLA saved ground on the backstretch while two wide, was moving up to menace three wide on the far turn
into the home stretch but it was not enough. START SINGING chased the pace while two wide on the backstretch, was in a hard drive on the far turn to rally
in the stretch and was no threat. GYPSY REWARD was unhurried early then came out four wide on the far turn and was in a hard drive down the lane but
was no threat. SHE'S MY WARRIOR set the pace along the inside into the early backstretch, was headed at the three eighths pole, then continued to bid
mildly on the far turn then weakened in late stretch. STRABELLA was unhurried early then rallied while two wide in the stretch and was no threat. LADY
CLARE raced in the middle of the field while two wide then bid mildly in upper stretch and was no menace. AMARETTO DI AMORE raced while three wide
in the middle of the field, was gaining ground steadily on the far turn, then flattened out in the lane. SAINT SARENA raced from the inside and failed to rally.
BREWHOUSE chased the pace while three wide, was in a stiff drive entering the far turn then stopped and had no final bid. ROYALS' LIL DIVA was no
factor.

Footnotes
RIVIERA CHAMP broke readily, sped clear of the field remaining off the rail racing to the backstretch, held sway on a commanding margin into upper stretch
and was kept to task. TOP DOG, reserved along the inside in the opening half, saved ground gaining position on the far turn, then angled four wide
advancing between foes into the lane to prevail for the place honors late. SHATTERED DREAMS, off slowly, was settled last to the far turn, swung out six
wide racing into upper stretch and produced a solid closing effort while just outkicked for second. BEHAVIN MYSELF, urged along the inside pursuing the
pacesetter from the outset to the far turn, emptied out late. CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE, off slowly, tracked the off the second flight while shifting well off the rail
in the opening half, was fanned five wide racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed late response. MALIBU CHANNEL tracked off the second flight
between foes in the opening half, was prompted to split rivals just off the inside nearing upper stretch but had no final kick. SHINBORO, forwardly placed
three wide tracking just off the pacesetter to the far turn, faded between foes nearing upper stretch, then steadied avoiding tight quarters racing past the
three sixteenths marker losing all momentum. BOOTLEGGIN POSSE, reluctant to load, broke inwards bumping THIRSTY KISS at the start, was prompted
to contention racing in the five path through the first turn, continued with interest four wide into the second bend and gave way after six furlongs. THIRSTY
KISS, bumped at the start, dropped out early.
