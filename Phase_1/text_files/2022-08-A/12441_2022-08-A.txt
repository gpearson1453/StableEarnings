SIR BARCLAY away alertly and raced to a clear advantage from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace from along the rail in the run down
the backstretch and into the final turn, repelled a challenge from MARTELLO leaving the turn, and drew clear from that rival in the lane to prove best.
MARTELLO broke sharply and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched his bid two wide entering the final turn and
loomed a danger leaving the turn, but was unable to match strides with SIR BARCLAY late while proving clearly second best. TRUPON ONLINE settled off
the early pacesetter while saving ground into the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in
the drive while unable to improve his position. SIMPLY GOLDEN unhurried early while trailing the field into the first turn, bided her time at the back of the
pack in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact. TEXAS KID REFUSED TO BREAK.
Following the running of this race there was both a stewards inquiry into the start, as well as a jockey's claim of foul into the run away from the gate. The
rider of MARTELLO lodged a claim of foul against the rider of SIR BARCLAY for alleged interference away from the gate. After review the stewards deemed
that all runners received a fair start, and that TEXAS KID refused to break. And the jockey's claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the
original order of finish.

REMARKABLE GIRL unhurried early while trailing the field into the first turn, advanced smartly three wide midway down the backstretch, rallied two out from
the rail through the final turn, and closed determinedly four out from the rail to get up in time. CATTITUDE away alertly and dueled for the lead two out from
the rail through the stretch the first time, took command through the second turn and controlled the pace in the run down the backside, rallied along the rail
entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive but was unable to fend off the late surge by REMARKABLE GIRL. HARBOUR STORM
stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, advanced three wide upon entering the backstretch and raced into a
tracking trip in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive. BLING IT ON HOME broke sharply
and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, dropped into a stalking trip in the run down the backstretch, but struggled to keep
up in the run to the final turn, and had little to offer over the final furlong. SUNBURNT tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one
out from the rail, began to drop back in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer late. The one mile split for this race was currently unavailable

FINDING WAYS away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch got the better of his pace rival entering he final turn, repelled a challenge from BAKLANE leaving the turn, and drew clear in the drive.
BAKLANE broke sharply and tracked the battling leaders into the backstretch while saving ground along the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final
turn, loomed a danger leaving the turn, but was unable to match strides with the winner in the late stages. JUVEE TOO settled well off the contested early
pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, commenced his bid five wide entering the final turn, and finished full of run five wide in the drive to get
up for a share. VANCOUVER'S HUNTER away well and stalked the dueling leader while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched his
bid four wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response in the lane when called upon. ACCEPT NO OTHER settled well off the early
pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide from well back entering he final turn, and found his best stride late while
finishing one out from the rail in the drive. VALUABLE COWBOY pressed the leader two wide entering the first turn, continued to force the issue from the
outside of FINDING WAYS in the run down the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on his pace rival entering the final turn, and faded over the final
furlong.

QUALITY COMMAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace while racing just out from the rail in
the run down the backside and into the final turn, and drew clear in the lane to prove best. VALUE DANCER unhurried early while dropping back to trail,
launched her bid three out from the rail into the final turn, and finished willingly four wide in the drive to get up for the place in deep stretch. INDYGOGOLD
tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to
hold on for a share. TEXAS LEGACY stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, checked from between rivals when put in
tight quarters entering the final turn and dropped back, but finished with some late interest five wide in the lane. DRILL BABY DRILL settled off the early
pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, advanced two out from the rail midway down the backstretch to loom a threat entering the final turn, rallied
three wide into the turn, but was outfinished in the late stages. PAGODA RIDGE broke sharply and stalked the leader from along the rail entering the
backstretch, steadied sharply when put in tight quarters at the rail entering the final turn, and was unable to mount a late bid after that. Following the running
of this race there was a stewards inquiry as well as two jockey claims of foul into an incident approaching the final turn, The rider of TEXAS LEGACY lodged
a claim of foul against the rider of INDYGOGOLD, and the rider of PAGODA RIDGE lodged a claim of foul against the rider of TEXAS GOLD. After review
both claims of foul as well as the stewards inquiry were disallowed and no change was made to the original order of finish.

PINEAPPLE TIDBITS was taken in hand and dropped to the back of the filed in the run to the first turn, continued to bide her time at the back of the pack
through the second turn, advanced four wide midway down the backstretch and continued while taking aim three wide at the pacesetter entering the final
turn, assumed command entering the lane, and quickly drew clear while racing four wide in the drive to prove best. HARLAN'S ANGEL away well and raced
to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace from just off the rail through the second turn and in the run down the backside,
maintained her advantage entering the final turn, was tackled by PINEAPPLE TIDBITS leaving the turn, and while no match for that rival in the lane, finished
determinedly from along the rail in the drive to hold the place. MAKIN IT UP away alertly and tracked the leader one out from the rail through the stretch the
first time, maintained her position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide into the final turn, and finished two out from the rail to garner a share.
CERTIFIABLE stalked the early pace through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but
failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. TIMELESS SHRUG broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter from along the rail through the stretch the
first time, continued to save ground through the second turn, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer over the final furlong.
