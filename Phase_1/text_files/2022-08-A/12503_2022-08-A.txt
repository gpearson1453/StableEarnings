the pace until the top of the stretch then was used up. JOHNNY BOOTLEGGS raced wide and was outrun.

match for the winner while just hanging on for second. BOLD GINGER stalked the pace along the inside into the stretch, drifted out to the six path and just
missed getting up for second. ETTA showed early speed three wide then weakened. LIL O. T. stumbled badly at the start and trailed throughout.

SHOW SLIDING HOME never far back, rallied three wide through the turn to make the lead at the top of the stretch then widened the balance of the trip to
win as much the best under right handed urging. JACK BE FAST stalked the pace into the stretch, rallied in the six path and finished clear for second.
RIDGE WEST pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened. OHIO PLAYER saved ground, lacked room along the rail in mid stretch, checked
and lost momentum. PRECIOUS JULES was never close. ROLLIN ON TEQUILA sped to the lead soon after the start, set a rapid pace into the stretch,
drifted in a bit at the furlong marker and tired. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

DYRDEK allowed to settle, rallied four wide into the stretch, gained a narrow lead under right handed whip at the furlong marker and proved best under mild
urging. WARRIOR'S DREAM saved ground and finished with good courage inside the winner. MAGICAL EXPRESS chased the early pace, made the lead
two wide into the far turn, set the pace until mid stretch then was outfinished. STORM RISK broke in front and quickly opened a daylight lead, set the pace
into the start turn along the inside, remained a sharp threat until deep stretch then faded. LONGLIVEJUSTICE failed to menace. SMASH moved up three
wide nearing the quarter pole then came up empty. DOUBLE THE LAUGH outrun.

ROLLIN ALL THE WAY pressed the pace three wide into the stretch, dug in late under left handed urging and proved best in a game effort. A SMILE A DAY
broke in front, set a pressured pace two wide until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner but held on for second. STAR MABEE pressed the pace
along the rail, dropped back a bit on the turn then came on again in a determined effort. TWERK settled along the rail into the stretch, altered course sharply
to the five path late and was steadily gaining ground. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE found her best stride late in the six path. MOBIL MEISTER had good early
speed, fanned out to the five path entering the stretch, was shut off late and faded.
