Footnotes
TRIBAL IMPACT bumped with Hashtag Bae at the start, raced off the early pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, angled out through the stretch
run and just got up under strong handling. STANLEY RYDER was coaxed along early from the outside while racing three wide, had a clear lead near the
three sixteenths pole, dug in late and missed in a game effort. LICORICE DROP POPS chased the early pace while racing just off the inside, checked
sharply near the five sixteenths pole, shifted out to race wide in the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. BEARCREEK MOUNTAIN showed good
early speed to set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened through the stretch run. PROUDTOBESICILIAN was void of early speed, raced four wide
into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. HASHTAG BAE was bumped at the start, pressed the pace while racing between rivals and tired the final quarter of
a mile. The official race time was hand timed.

RED NOON RISING stalked the pace while racing three deep early on, shifted out five wide near the three sixteenths pole to race outside of rivals and
finished strongly to just get up under strong encouragement. PLEASE ME tracked Judicial early on while racing two wide, raced three to four wide in the
stretch run and missed in a game effort. JUDICIAL showed good early speed to set the pace from the inside and weakened a bit the final furlong. LAKER
JET raced off the early pace, moved up three wide into the lane and raced evenly late. SLEEPY SUE chased the pace from the inside and lacked a bid.
CLOCHARD STREET was off slowly, raced at the back of the pack early, was six wide into the upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
LLOYDS LOGIC showed good early speed to set the pace and dew off in the stretch to be well clear under steady handling. WEGOTBEERONICE was
rated along off the early leader down the backstretch, raced towards the inside throughout and was no match for the winner. ICE TOWER was forced to
check sharply in the early stages near the half mile pole, raced along the inside through the far turn through the stretch and improved position. TIME 'ER
TOO stalked the pace from the outside, raced five wide through the far turn, swung six wide into the upper lane and had no late closing run. RAAJIN
RIBBON was reluctant to load, coaxed along in the early stages and had no final bid in the drive. LANGSTON ROAD chased the early pace, raced four to
five wide through the upper stretch and had no late rally. MY LAST BULLET dropped back off the early pace, raced towards the inside and had no
response. I'M NOBLE was off slowly, raced three wide near the quarter pole, raced from the outside in the stretch and lacked a bid. KAHALA was void of
early speed and failed to respond. TIME WEAVE SHARED raced five deep around the far turn, raced towards the outside in the stretch run and never
threatened.

YOU'RE THE CAUSE was forced to check at the start, void of early speed, made a strong move while racing five wide through the far turn, raced seven
deep into the upper stretch, surged late and was a going away winner under strong encouragement. MIDNIGHT MOJO settled off the early pace while
racing in hand, moved up near the inside around the far turn, made a good rail bid through the stretch and just missed in a game effort. SMILING
GOODBYE set the early pace to lead down the backstretch from the inside, raced three wide in the lane and gave way grudgingly. EXECUTIVE CHEF
raced off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire.
ITSALLABOUTTHERIDE settled to the middle of the pack early on, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, shifted out four wide and flattened out in the
drive. A VIEW FROM ABOVE dropped back early, moved up five wide through the far turn, angled widest through the lane and had not enough. LITTLE
CASINO pressed the early pace while racing between rivals and weakened in the drive. NAPOLETANO was unhurried in the early going, raced four wide
near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a rally. BIG PAPER DADDY stalked the pace, raced four wide at the seven eighths pole, was along the inside in
the lane and weakened. SMOKEN SHADOW was coaxed along early while racing three wide down the backstretch and faded. WEAR THE CROWN raced
wide around the first turn, angled in down the backstretch, lost ground and was eased up on in the stretch run.

SLEW'S TIZ WHIZ was rated in the early stages, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, angled out three deep in the drive and finished strongly to draw
clear under steady handling. PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY was quick to begin to cross over from the outside to set the early pace, was well clear nearing the
eighth pole but was wore down late to be second best. FIVE STAR GENERAL raced five wide around the first turn, made a good advance through the far
turn, raced six to seven wide through the upper stretch and closed in well late with a wide trip. TOP EXECUTIVE tracked the early leader down the
backstretch, hard ridden through the far turn and weakened a bit in the stretch drive while racing three to two wide. BACKGROUND stalked the pace, took
aim while racing four wide near the three sixteenths pole and flattened out. MAJESTIC EAGLE raced off the earl pace, angled widest through the lane,
improved position but had not enough. TORPEDO AWAY was bumped at the break, unhurried in the early stages, raced near the inside at the quarter pole,
continued its room into the lane from the inside and had no late rally. SPITTIN IMAGE stalked the pace from the outside, was urged near the three eighths
pole and weakened in the drive. UNMACHABLE broke awkwardly, coaxed along to lay with the first flight but lacked a bid in the drive. KINGMEISTER was
slow early and never threatened. HARD TO DENY was bumped at the break and never meneaced. HUGE BIGLY dropped back early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SENOR FABULOSO settled off the early pace, moved up five wide near the three sixteenths pole and forged clear under strong pressure. TAP THE BANK
hesitated break, moved up five wide through the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. SALTY DAN showed good early foot to the early pace and gave
way grudgingly. FANTASTIC DREAM was void of early speed, moved up six to seven wide and closed belatedly. STANWOOD WARRIOR chased the early
pace and weakened in the drive. NUMMY NUM was coaxed along from the inside and tired. ATTORNEY LOUIS pressed the early lead from the outside
while racing two wide and gave way.
