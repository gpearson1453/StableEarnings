Footnotes
PLATINUM QUEEN loomed alone in the second flight though the opening half, angled out to three wide at upper stretch and rallied for the score. GINNY B
broke alertly and pressed the pace from a two path stance through the first turn, gained command near the midway point, led the charge at top of the
stretch, but was unable to fend off the rallying foe in final sixteenth. QUINN MURPHY was unhurried and trailed the field around the opening bend, closed
the gap on leaders around the final turn, and earned the show with a late rush while gaining on the leaders. LIMITLESS MAZIE rushed form outset and
established first command, led the field along eh backstretch while saving ground, but eclipsed in final furlong.

Footnotes
LUCKY CRUSADER tucked behind the early pacesetting duo and saved ground around the opening bend, angled out to three wide at the midway point,
gained command around the closing turn, then drew off for a clear score. SIR OVERANALYZE settled into a two path stance and was unhurried through the
opening half, then angled out at upper stretch to be widest of all and earned the place with late interest but was no match for the tough winner in the end.
OREGON COUNTY failed to sustain the bid after pressing the early pace from a two path stance. THISGUYCANFLY showed reserve and trailed the field
from outset before passing a tiring rival in the homestretch. FINAL NARRATIVE rushed from outset and led the field through the half from a ground saving
pose before rapidly retreating in the crucial stages.

CANT ATTACK ARCH inched away for the score after hustling away from the break and setting the pace in unison as the inner most rival. LAYLALLEE
hustled from outset and set the pace in tandem with CANT ATTACK ARCH, trekked the two path around the bend, but was unable to match strides with that
rival in final furlong. MISS CONTINENTAL settled into second flight, trekked three wide at upper stretch, and came up empty in the homestretch. UMEA
ZING GRACE saved ground to no avail. SASSY RED trailed from outset and was no menace.

AFRICAN WARRIOR broke alertly, chased the front runner around the bend while rating alone in the second flight, and finished a clear second but was no
match or the runaway winner in the end. CRAFTY HEAT lacked a rally after giving chase from mid pack and travelling the three path around the hook.
AUTOCRATIC failed to threaten from a back rated stance. PAYNT YOUR WAGON rushed from outset, established a comfortable margin early on, and led
every step of the way while widening the margin. ZONG TOUGH failed to menace from a trailing position.

Footnotes
WHEN'S TEE TIME stalked the early pacesetters from a two path stance, swung to three wide at upper stretch, and kicked clear for the score. MONARCH
MAN loomed off the heels of the pacesetter around the first turn, angled out to the four path at upper stretch, then rallied in final furlong to earn the place.
WHITAKER rushed from outset and gained first command, led the field through the opening half while saving ground, was on even terms as the inner most
rival of three abreast at upper stretch, but could not fend off the late charging rivals in the late strides. MILITARY BEARING was unhurried in the early going,
trekked a wide path around opening turn, and improved placing with a late rush. MO TAP came up empty after pressing the early pace from a two path pose
and establishing a brief lead at the quarter pole. UNCLE ARTIE closed with a rush and improved placing after trekking three wide through both bends. IMA
BIG BOPPER settled into mid pack through opening half while saving ground, angled out near the three sixteenths pole, but was unable to produce a rally in
final furlong. OLD SOT showed reserve early, travelled widest and lost ground to front runners. AMAVI settled into mid pack and gave chase from a two
path stance before tiring in the late going. MORO COOL broke alertly, rated mid pack through the half, then retreated thereafter.

Footnotes
MYFRIENDSAWINNER rushed from outset, led every step of the way and steadily widened the margin for a runaway victory. CUTE DINERO QUEEN
chased the speedy pacesetter along the backstretch, trekked the three path at upper stretch, and finished a clear second but was no match for runaway
winner. DELTA TRAVELER pressed the pace along the backstretch, saved ground around the bend, was on even terms for the place at upper stretch, then
weakened in final furlong. SMILING ANGEL failed to menace from a back rated stance. LIVVY LOU failed to threaten while saving ground.

Footnotes
COLD NIGHT AIR hustled from the break, led the field in tandem around the first bend, saved ground around the closing turn, and denied all challengers to
secure the score. AIRLINE DRIVE settled in behind pacesetting duo, led the second flight through the half, swung three wide at upper, locked into a stretch
duel, but was outdueled by eventual winner in final sixteenth. RUNAWAY HENNY showed reserve through the opening half, swung widest of all at upper
stretch and was gaining on leaders at the finish. DREAMIT was unhurried early, closed the gap on leaders along the backstretch, rated close up along the
inside at upper stretch, but came up empty in final furlong. GIFTED TALENT saved ground and tucked behind front runners in early stages before splitting
foes near the three sixteenths pole and rallying mildly to improve placing. SOCIAL DATE rushed from outset to press the pace while trekking the two path,
then steadily faded inside the quarter pole. THE MISSING PIECE travelled widest of all around the first turn, rated three wide at upper stretch and tired in
closing strides.
