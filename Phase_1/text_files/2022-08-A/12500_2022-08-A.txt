Footnotes
ROBTADI STORM hustled form outset and led the field along the backstretch in unison with GS STORM, locked into a duel at upper stretch and inched
clear in final sixteenth. G'S STORM broke sharply and set the pace in tandem along the backstretch, trekked the inside line around the bend, locked into a
stretch duel at head of homestretch, but was outdueled in final sixteenth. CALLEN FEELS GOOD tucked to an inside stance along the backstretch, saved
ground through the turn, and finished willingly for the show. BROOK IS GOLDEN stalked the pace setting duo along the backstretch, rated three wide at
upper stretch, then latched a mid pack rival in final furlong and failed to improve placing. PROUD REDEMPTION lacked a needed rally to end a four wide
journey. BAYOU SARGE settled into the second flight, tracked the two path and lost ground to front runners around the hook, and lacked a late bid.

Footnotes
ALPHA BROOKE proved best in the stretch duel after hustling away from gate and sharing the lead with FIRED UP TIGER from outset to upper stretch.
FIRED UP TIGER hustled from outset and exchanged command with ALPHA BROOKE, trekked the two path around the bend, then was outdueled by that
rival in final strides. RIVERCREST GIRL settled into mid pack and chased the pacesetting duo from a four wide pose, then lacked a needed rally and
finished a clear third. TYPO was unhurried along the backstretch and saved ground throughout but was unable to run down front running duo in final furlong.
CASCIA pressed the early pace as the widest of all rivals along the backstretch then faded steadily in the homestretch. COUSIN VICKIE trailed from outset
and was never involved.

Footnotes
LOU'S ARROW broke alertly, led at first stride, then was unchallenged while steadily opened up the margin on the field. MOONSHINE SURFER showed
reserve in early strides and trailed all rivals by multiple lengths, advanced on rivals along the backstretch, circled those rivals through the closing bend, and
rallied to secure the place but was no match for the runaway winner. ACCEL JOE was unhurried around the first turn, angled out to four wide at the half
pole, led the second flight at upper stretch then weakened in final furlong and held on to the show. WHITE TAIL DEER lacked a needed rally to end a
ground saving trip. VALENTORO rated mid pack through the opening half while trekking three wide, maintained that line around the closing bend, and
lacked late bid to improve placing. JUST BUSINESS came away sharply, led the second flight from a two path pose through the opening half, then stopped
inside the quarter pole.

THEO D'OR loomed just off the pace along the backstretch, rated three wide at upper stretch, and finsihed with best stride late to be drawing off from all
rivals in final sixteenth. RISKTAKER was rushed form outset to share early command, established an inside pose, saved ground around the bend, altered
lanes near the eighth pole, but came up empty in final sixteenth. SALUTE NOW hustled away at break, shared the early lead from a two path stance, rated
close up at upper stretch, but failed to sustain the bid in final furlong. JOHNNY JUDE rated back and saved ground to no avail. OUR CITY trailed from
outset and was no threat.

SHARP CHARLIE rushed from outset and led every step of the way for a gate to wire score. WILTON stalked the front runner from a two path pose but was
unable to catch that foe and finished a clear second. RAMMER JAMMER improved placing with late interest after showing reserve and rating back in the
early going. CRAZY RIDGE tucked to inside and saved ground around the bend, angled out at upper stretch, then tired in final strides. CAPTAINS COVE
lost ground to front runners with a wide trip. SMARTY RIDGE trailed from outset and failed to menace.

Footnotes
FIERY PLAYBOY broke alertly and led every step of the way while steadily widening the margin for a clear and convincing gate to wire victory. COFFEE
COUNTY rallied strongly for the place after showing reserve in early strides and travelling widest at upper stretch. SON CARLOS pressed the front runner
from a two path pose along the backstretch, maintained that line through the bend, locked into a late stretch duel for place honors but was nipped at wire
and forced to settle for the show. TWO B settled into mid pack along the backstretch, advanced through the bend to be three wide in second flight at upper
stretch, locked into a stretch duel inside the eighth pole, and was photoed out of the place. GUTZY came up empty in final sixteenth after stalking the
frontrunner from an inside stance and rating between rivals in second flight at upper stretch. HALF PAGE lacked a needed response to urging to end a three
path journey. RUNNINGINTHEMONEY failed to menace while giving chase from a two path position. MAGIC LIGHTNING trailed from outset and failed to
threaten while saving ground.

HAVE I EVER set the pace in tandem as the inner rival then drew clear in final furlong. C. C. HARBOR hustled early to share early command, set the pace
in unison as the outer rival of two abreast, and finished a clear second but was no match for winner in final furlong. MARCIAMARCIAMARCIA rushed from
outset and established an inside stance, rated close up through the first turn then gave way to pacesetting duo near the three quarter pole and held on for
the show but was no match for top pair. BEYOND THE HYPE gave chase while saving ground around the opening bend and passed a tiring foe in the late
stages. TIZ MY PLAN settled in and trekked the two path through opening half before tiring after the midway point.
