Footnotes
ANY PORT was well placed on the inside, waited for room, angled out on the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, closed willingly outside, ran down
the leader and pulled away late. PEGASUS IN FLIGHT raced four wide early, then stalked two wide, bid four wide on the far turn, kicked clear in upper
stretch and yielded with a hundred yards to go. TIME GOES FAST raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly for third. FAR
HEART dueled three wide early, then stalked, bid three wide on the far turn and weakened. GRACE IN MOTION raced two wide off the pace, came four
wide into the lane and lacked a rally. N Y FANCY steadied at the start, dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the far turn and faded. RELENTLESS CANDY
raced three wide early, settled two wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. HOT LITTLE NUMBER was a bit reluctant to load,
raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. WAR IN PARADISE pulled in the early stages, dueled between rivals for command, vied two wide on the
backside, dueled on the far turn and gave way.
