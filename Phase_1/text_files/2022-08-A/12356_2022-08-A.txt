LOGICAL AL stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, advanced three wide midway down the backstretch and battled for
the lead three wide through the final turn, assumed command leaving the turn, and drew clear late. BRIAN'S DE LEIGHT away alertly and vied for the lead
from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was overtaken
leaving the turn, but battled gamely from along the rail in the drive to hold the place. ISLAND LIVING stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving
ground along the inside, pulled her way into a tracking trip behind the dueling leaders in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, tipped four
wide entering the lane, and closed willingly to just miss the place. ROARING DESTINY broke sharply, but was eased to the back of the field in the run to the
first turn, bided his time well behind the field in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished with late interest three
out from the rail in the stretch drive. DANCING WITH LIL rushed up to duel for the lead from the outside of BRIAN'S DE LEIGHT entering the first turn,
forced the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide from between rivals through the final turn, but faded in the
drive.

LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, launched her bid three wide
entering the final turn, collared the pacesetter leaving the turn, and wore down that stubborn rival in the closing strides to prevail. FILLY FATALE away well
and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn while under a snug
hold, was collared by the winner leaving the turn, and battled gamely through the lane to just miss. MS. STANFORD away alertly and tracked the leader into
the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide from between rivals through the final turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail in the
drive to garner a share. HIGHER IMAGE stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, continued to save ground through the final
turn while awaiting room leaving the turn, but lacked the needed closing response in the drive when called upon. STOPSHOPPINGSHELLY unhurried early
while dropping back to trail entering the first turn, began to advance three wide midway down the backside to gain a striking position, rallied three wide
through the final turn, and was gaining late while finishing four wide in the drive. SHESBOURBONONICE settled off the early pace while racing one out from
the rail entering the backstretch, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer over the final furlong.

INFINITE PATIENCE away alertly and tracked the pacesetter three wide into the stretch the first time, continued to bide her time just off the leader while
four wide entering the backstretch, pulled herself to the lead approaching the final turn and quickly opened a clear advantage, and drew off as much the best
while under confident handling. WE B THREE stalked the early pace while racing three wide entering the stretch the first time, maintained her position in the
run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished willingly two wide in the drive to get up for the place. SOLARITY broke
sharply and stalked the leader through the lane the first time while saving ground along the rail, launched her bid from along the inside entering the final
turn, and closed determinedly from between rivals in the stretch drive to get up for a share. HEIDI settled off the early pace while saving ground through the
stretch the first time, commenced her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, and closed with late interest in a
solid effort. DAPHNE away well and raced to the led while racing just out from the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace through the stretch the first
time and in the run down the backside, while racing out from the rail, was overtaken approaching the final turn, and faded in the late stages. QUEEN OF
ATTITUDE was off a step slow, and settled off the early pacesetters while racing three wide into the lane the first time, rallied two wide into the final turn, but
failed to make a serious late impact. REA MEA settled well off the early pace while racing three wide through the stretch the first time, dropped back in the
run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer over the final furlong.

Footnotes
CASCADE BILLY broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, battled for the lead three wide through the final
turn, and wore down a very stubborn BOLD ARCH in the final stride to prevail. BOLD ARCH away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering
the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch, battled for the lead from along the rail through the final turn, held a narrow advantage into
the lane, and just failed to last. SYNERGY tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied smartly two wide through the
final turn, and closed with late interest four wide in the drive while gaining late. SIR BREGOVIC away well and pressed the leader in the run down the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide from between rivals through the final turn, was unable to match strides with the top pair
entering the lane, and was outfinished late while fighting on bravely. BIG UNION settled off the early pace while racing four wide entering the first turn,
continued with a wide trip in the run down the backstretch, and lacked the needed closing response when called upon.

SOARINGFORTHESUN away alertly and tracked the pacesetter through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two
wide in the run down the backstretch from the outside of DON W, disposed of his pace rival entering the final turn and quickly opened a clear advantage,
and was never seriously threatened late. GUNFIGHTER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, bided his time at the back of the pack through the
second turn and in the run down the backside, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three out from the rail in the drive
to get up for the place in the final strides. REGAL RIOT settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time,
commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly two wide in the drive and just failed to hold the place. ALL LIQUORD UP away
well and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but needed more late
while finishing one out from the rail in the drive. MOUNT ASGARD stalked the leaders while racing head strong at the rail through the stretch the first time,
dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. DON W broke
sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of SOARINGFORTHESUN in the
run down the backstretch, was unable to match strides with that rival entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

LEGACY SQUARE stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, maintained his position while racing out from the
rail in the run down the backside, angled in to save ground approaching the final turn, was forced to check when lacking room entering the turn, shifted four
wide entering the lane, and closed determinedly to get up in the closing strides. BAK TO LIBERTY tracked the battling leaders in the run down the backside
while racing one out from the rail, collared the pacesetters while moving three wide into the final turn, shook off the challenge from MAGIC ROAD entering
the lane, and just failed to last. MAGIC ROAD settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, advanced
three wide midway down the backstretch, and continued with a menacing four wide move through the final turn to challenge for the lead entering the lane,
and finished gamely two wide in rhe drive to garner a share. TIME TICKER unhurried early, while dropping back to trail, launched his bid four wide entering
the final turn, raced up on the heels of LEGACY SQUARE entering the lane, and finished three wide in the drive while improving his position. BUCK IN
COMMAND away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of REMEMBERTHEALAMO entering he first turn, forced the issue from the outside of that
rival in the run down the backstretch, battled through the final turn from between rivals, but faded in the stretch drive. REMEMBERTHEALAMO broke
sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn, and weakened late.

Footnotes
KLOEPATRA broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, held her position in the run down the
backstretch while shifting off the rail to collar the leader entering the final turn, quickly assumed command entering the turn and opened a clear advantage,
and increased that margin over the final furlong while being kept to task. AMANDA settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the
stretch the first time, dropped back to trail in the run down the backstretch, launched her bid one out from the rail through the final turn, and finished gamely
four wide in the drive to get up for the place in the late stages. U DID IT was fractious just prior to the start, and appeared to be still in the hands of the
assistant starter when the gates opened, trailed the field into the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, began to advance three wide midway
down the backstretch to gain a striking position in the run to the final turn, rallied two out from the rail through the turn, but hung late after trying to overcome
her troubled beginning. REMARKABLE ANGEL settled off the early pacesetters while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time,
commenced her bid three wide from well back entering the final turn, and improved her position in the late going while racing two out from the rail, but was
unable to mount a serious late bid. BELCARRA PARK away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through
the second turn and into the backstretch, was quickly overtaken entering the final turn, and faded in the late stages. SHAMRA away alertly and stalked the
leader from along the inside through the stretch the first time, maintained her position while continuing to save ground into the final turn, but failed to
respond when called upon. ALOBRAH tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, struggled to hold her position in
the run to the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. Following the running of this race the stewards conducted an inquiry into the start, in particular
to that of U DID IT. After review the stewards deemed that all runners received a fair start, and no change was made to the original order of finish.
