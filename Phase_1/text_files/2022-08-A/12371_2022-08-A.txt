HOME BASE led three wide, then lugged out late in spite of the jockey's best effort and just lasted. POLAR WIND was unrushed early, rallied six wide in
early stretch and was steadied coming to the finish. TAPIT'S SPIRIT pressed the pace outside of the winner, then gave way in the stretch. BANDIDO DE
AMORES stalked the pace in the four path, then couldn't close late. FROSTED GRACE pressed the pace in the four path, then had no late gain. MISTER
KELLY pressed the pace inside, then gave way in the stretch. TALE OF FAME raced in the two path but had no bid. DEVIL'S TOWER saved ground to no
avail. DOUBLE TUFF raced in the four path before fading on the turn. Following an inquiry and an objection by the rider of POLAR WIND against the
winner, the Stewards declined to take action.

the pace inside, bid inside on the far turn, was steadied nearing the quarter pole in tight quarters, angled three wide into the stretch and closed late outside
of the winner. COPPER KING was unrushed inside, angled six wide on the far turn and then rallied late. NOT VERY GENTLE was unrushed in the three
path, bid late but faltered. BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN bobbled at the start, stalked the pace inside, then had no late bid. KIDYOUNOT dueled inside of
LONTANI and both gave way in the stretch. COUNTER OFFER stalked the early pace in the three path before giving way. DRAMATIC KITTEN was not a

Footnotes
OURNATIONONPARADE pressed the pace while two wide, gained a short nose lead in early backstretch then dropped back slightly to be well rated around
the far turn, dug in gamely then drew away in the stretch to prove best. CONTACT TRACING was reserved on the back stretch while four wide, was gaining
ground to bid three wide on the far turn then menaced in the home stretch but could not catch the leader. MAN IN THE CAN set the pace from the inside,
then was in a long drive into the far turn then weakened in late stretch. ESKENFORIT was out slowly then stalked the pace in the three path, then settled
along the rail on the far turn to make a mild bid in the lane but was no threat. SUPER CONSTITUTION raced in the middle of the field while four wide down
the back stretch then came out six wide to rally on the far turn then flattened out in late stretch. SERMONONTHEMOUNT raced along the inside in the
middle of the field and failed to menace. BANDIT SWANSON trailed behind the field while three wide and was no factor.

rival in the end. SOMETHING NATURAL broke inwardly at the start then was in a steady drive while four wide then menaced in upper stretch to close well in
the end. PEPPER PIKE chased the pace while in the two path then rallied on the far turn then flattened out in the final furlongs. CALIFORNIA SWING was
unhurried early then was gaining ground while five wide to bid on the far turn but came up evenly in the stretch. JOLTING JOE settled along the inside and
