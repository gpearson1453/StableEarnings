Footnotes
SHEZACONSTANTSONG was allowed to settle in stride while saving ground, angled out three-wide to launch a bid nearing the quarter, caught Release the
Genie inside the eighth pole and prevailed narrowly in a stiff drive. RELEASE THE GENIE dueled with Cora Belle for the lead from along the inside, shook
that one off to open clear nearing the eighth pole, responded when asked and held on gamely to lose a tough decision. MISS JAX was unhurried early,
came three-wide into the stretch and was gaining ground late. I GET STORMED dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild
rally. CATTY DOM saved ground from the start, offered a mild bid entering the stretch bud lacked the needed late response. CORA BELLE forced the pace
to the stretch from along the outside and gave way.

Footnotes
ROCKTHEPULPIT dueled from the lead from the outset while saving ground and proved narrowly best in a prolonged drive. BULLY RIDE vied for the lead
from along the outside, couldn't get by the winner and just missed in a game effort. ASCOT STORM saved ground stalking the pace, angled out to come
three-wide into the stretch, caught the leaders nearing the eighth pole but was unable to get by them in a strong effort. BESITOS CRIMINALES was never
far back, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. GUSHER prompted the issue to the stretch while three-wide, drifted out slightly during
the drive and weakened. INDY MOON saved ground while being unhurried, rallied along the inside into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. CATABILITY
raced five-wide on the turn, was eight-wide entering the stretch and finished willingly. SO CAL MEMORY was prominent to the stretch while racing four-wide
and tired. LUCKY WITH YOU dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LINCOLN COUNTY KID lacked early speed, came
five-wide into the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
CAIRO KING prompted the pace from along the outside, was carried out leaving the quarter by Flat Fast, caught that one in the stretch, came in late to
brush with him and proved narrowly best. FLAT FAST saved ground setting the pace, drifted out leaving the quarter pole then angled back to the inside,
came out slightly late to brush with Cairo King and just missed. JEN'S BIG O was unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out to
come three-wide into the stretch and was gaining ground late. ME AND JACK dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild
rally. REINING PESOS moved up 3-wide on the turn to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole, but was unable to sustain his rally. KICK IT was prominent early
while racing three-wide and tired. FLICKERING LIGHT was forwardly placed early racing along the inside, but lacked a rally. The trainer of Flat Fast lodged
an objection against Cairo King, but after viewing the films, the stewards made no change in the order of finish.

Footnotes
DEPUTY'S ECHO was allowed to settle in side, rallied five-wide and was up with a rush in the final sixteenth. HUNTINGTONS RITHM was bumped at the
start by Seeulatergator, then was unhurried, rallied six-wide into the stretch and finished fast. SEEULATERGATOR broke in to bump Huntingtons Rithm,
then dueled for the lead while racing slightly removed from the rail, responded when asked and held on fairly well during the drive. JORNALERO was
prominent from the start, moved through along the inside to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out during the drive. FOLLOW THE
FACTS vied for the lead from the outside to the stretch and tired. PATRIOT came six-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DOCTOR TINK saved
ground while stalking the pace, angled out for the drive but lacked a response.

EZ GUESS prompted the pace from along the outside, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and quickly drew clear. TORRIE THE RAPPER was off step
slow, then improved his position racing between horses on the turn, angled out for the drive, could not reach the winner but finished well for the place in a
good effort. DAN WHO was unhurried early, rallied along the inside on the turn, angled out for the drive and finished strongly. BRIGHT WAY saved ground
setting the pace into the stretch and weakened slightly late. BINGOS SYSTEM prompted the issue to the stretch while racing three-wide and tired. RED
RASCAL came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LAUGHING STORM failed to menace while racing eight-wide. M G M'S LUCKY was
prominent early while racing four-wide and gave way after a half mile. ASSISTANT dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch but was not a
factor. RIGHT ON TIME raced six-wide on the turn and showed little. GO FOR THE LAUGH was forwardly placed early racing along the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
MISTY MATT saved ground stalking the pace, slipped through during the drive and finished strongly to end up on dead-heat with Mamacita Cartier for the
win. MAMACITA CARTIER dueled for the lead from along the inside, drifted out slightly entering the stretch and held on gamely to end up on even terms
with Misty Matt for the win. PREMEDITATED LILY vied for the lead throughout from along the outside but wasn't quite good enough in a game effort.
CYNICAL GIRL was prominent from the start, came four-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. CAROLS BOUTIQUE was unhurried early, came
five-wide into the stretch and gained her best stride too late. BLUE LUNA WHO came six-wide into the stretch and was gaining some ground late.
ALLERGIC TO LOGIC was three-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. JASMINE BABY raced four-wide on the turn and was
not a factor. SPICEY SECRET saved ground while being forwardly placed, but lacked a response. SHAMEONNATALIE gave way after showing brief speed.
SOUNDOFME NOTCALLN dropped back after breaking out and failed to meance. DESERT BEAUTY was off a step slow and showed little.

Footnotes
RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP prompted the issue from along the inside, took the lead in the stretch responded to pressure and drew clear late. SILVER KID set
the pressured pace racing off the rail, drifted out leaving the turn, then bore out in deep stretch to bump Dia De Pago and held on well. For interference in
deep stretch, Silver Kid was disqualified from second and placed third. DIA DE PAGO was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch, was finishing
fast when bumped by Silver Kid and was unable to recover in time. MAGIC IS FLYING was allowed to settle in stride while saving ground, angled out to
come two-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. RUNNINGINTHERAIN prompted the pace while racing three-wide to the stretch and tired. REVOLT AND
RIOT bobbled at the start, then dropped far back and failed to threaten. BABO STORM gave way after showing brief speed from between horses.
GREENBRIER stumbled at the start to unseat his rider and was walked off following the race. The Steward conducted and inquiry into the start but after
viewing the films made no change in the order of finish regarding the start.

Footnotes
KIRBY DERBY prompted the pace from along the outside, took the lead nearing the stretch, quickly drew clear and was ridden out to increase his
advantage. BEAR BRIAN was prominently placed while racing three-wide, was no match for the winner but continued on well for the place. SIXTH GEAR
saved ground stalking the pace, came four-wide into the stretch and finished fairly well. GATLING GOLD was allowed to settle in stride, came five-wide into
the stretch and went evenly late. CLOSING TIME CUTIE saved ground setting the early pace and tired. HOT LIL MESS dropped back early, came four-wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. SOULONG saved ground but lacked a rally. BOB'SALLWICKED was not a factor while racing two-wide. SMOKEN
HOUDINI was forwardly placed while racing thre-wide, gave way after three furlongs and was pulled up and vanned off.
