steady gain, drew off and was kept to the task. ROLLING MO well placed, gained a striking position three and four wide through the second turn, came four
wide into the stretch and closed well for the place, while no threat to the winner. MOANA'S TALE sprinted to a clear lead well off the rail, stayed on when
challenged in the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. ANIMAUXSELLE mid pack, saved ground on the two path while moving to
position through the second turn, angled in and came through inside of rivals, then angled out for clear racing room and could not gain.
THISAINTJUMPSTREET hopped at the start, moved up inside through the second turn, then could not gain the final furlong. HOXIE was never involved.
