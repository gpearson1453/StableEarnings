DRIVEN BY SPEED was allowed to settle and saved ground to the quarter pole, eased out and came four wide into the lane, closed well to get up seventy
yards from the wire and drew clear to prove best under mild urging. CHARGE IT JENN was well rated on the inside, eased out nearing the quarter pole to
launch a three wide bid, hit the front leaving the turn and was clear by the furlong marker, but was caught late, second best. ELUSIVE RYDER was reserved
on the inside, advanced mid way on the turn and angled out in the lane and finished willingly to best the rest. LADY BREXIT was allowed to settle three wide
and had no rally. FRISKY FEELING was reserved while four to five wide and had no rally. WOW FACTOR was away alertly to set the pace while clear and
then was headed leaving the quarter pole and gave way. LIGHTNING ROUND tracked the pace two to three wide, then was between foes by the five

and was outfinished after a long drive to just miss. ZIPPY JO was away alertly to set the early pace on the inside, then was two wide leaving the turn, vied
for command between rivals by the furlong marker and was outfinished late, good effort. GRAND SKYLARK was bumped at the start, then advanced on the

SIMPLY STATED was off a step slow, then once into stride made a five wide run to stalk the pace setters, made a four wide move leaving the turn and
quickly took over, then drew out smartly to prove best under a couple left handed reminders. IOANNA vied for the lead four wide, then was three wide by the
quarter pole, kept on to the wire to be second best, no match for the winner. HOT FUDGE WARRIOR vied for the lead on the inside and faded in the drive,
bested rest. ROSE OF SHANAKILL was allowed to settle and came four wide into the lane and had n o rally, even effort. OUTSPEND passed the tiring
rivals. FORTUNE TELLER vied for the lead between rivals and weakened. MADISON COUNTY was settled on the inside and failed tom menace. UPTOWN
ANGEL checked after the start, not a factor. There was no head on replay given so these notes were written from only the pan shot.

Footnotes
AMERICAN CHESTNUT was away alertly and soon clear to set the pace while well clear racing off the inside, then was kept to right handed crop pressure
to prove much the best. HIS NAME IS SUE was settled early, then was two to three wide on the turn, then drifted out through the lane and held the place
award. AGAINST THE ODDS was reserved early on the inside, steadied by the quarter pole, then offered a belated rally on the inside to gain the show
award. KUDURO was reserved early and two wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. KADENS COURAGE was settled early and three to four wide on
the turn and then was empty in the drive. IMPACTFUL was settled and four to five wide on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SPIKES SHIRL was well rated early, then eased out and made a four wide move nearing the quarter pole, continued that move and hit the front nearing the
furlong marker and drew clear to prove best under a drive. COLOUR GUARD vied for the early lead on the inside, then rated off the pace on the turn and
came two wide into the lane and then angled back to the rail and ran on but needed more, held place. ROCKIN COWBOY was reserved early, then checked
leaving the three eighths, then checked again by the five sixteenths, dropped to the inside for racing room, then was advancing leaving the turn, had to
angle out by the furlong marker and finished willingly, rough trip. GO HUSKIES was close up early, then was shuffled back on the turn, came five wide into
the lane and had a belated rally. SIR ROCKPORT vied for the lead on the outside, then made a bid to draw clear on the turn and moved towards the rail, but
weakened in the drive. COAST TO COAST chased the early pace and had no rally. DREAMING OF LOVE was rated early, made a three wide move on the
turn but then was empty in the drive. AFLEET TRAXX was bumped at the start, then raced wide on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
ELITE SPEED was rated along early, made a four wide bid leaving the turn and continued that bid to edge away late under a drive. ORIGINALY FROM
DOT eased off the inside by the five eighths marker, tracked the pace and was two wide on the turn, made a three wide bid leaving the turn, continued on to
the wire but was outfinished by the winner. MARIE FROM PARIE set the pace and crossed over to the inside, then was headed leaving the furlong marker
and faded. BETTER YET was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn, shifted off the inside in the lane but had no punch. TIZ PROMISING RVF
had a belated rally on the inside. COTTON CANDY CUTIE was bumped at the start, then settled early and was four wide on the turn and had no rally.
RIDGELYSREDHOT had no rally while wide. SPLENDOR GAL chased the pace four wide and weakened. ABOVE THE LINE was between rivals and
clipped heels around the five eighths marker and fell, vanned off. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING AROUND THE FIVE
EIGHTHS MARKER, AFTER REVIEWING THE REPLAYS THEY DISQUALIFIED ORIGINALLY FROM DOT FROM SECOND AND PLACED HER LAST
FOR INTERFERENCE CAUSING THE RIVAL TO CLIP HEELS.

Footnotes
PEPE TONO chased the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn, then edged clear late to prove best under a drive. THE ROBERT was
allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn, continued on but could not get to the winner, second best. EDICT was settled back early,
advanced on the turn and was four wide by the quarter pole, came five wide into the lane and was up late for the show award. CATTLE DRIVE was rated
along early, then shifted to the outside and was six wide by the quarter pole, came seven wide into the lane and had no kick. MEROCKETMAN set the pace
on the inside and weakened the final furlong. AMERICAN FLEET chased the pace on the inside and weakened. DIAMOND SETTER stalked the pace three
wide and tired. FOR THE MOMENT was off slowly and was not a threat. ESPRESSO CALIENTE was reserved early on the inside and was not a factor.
POCOPSON STATION showed little.
