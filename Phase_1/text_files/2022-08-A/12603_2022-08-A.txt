three wide in the final furlong, dug in gamely and got up late. THE STEELMAN dueled for the lead with SUPER CINDY around the turn, battled on into the
lane, held a slim lead at the sixteenth pole then got edged by the winner in closing strides. SUPER CINDY vied for the lead in opening strides then dueled
inside of THE STEELMAN around the turn, battled for command into the final furlong then yielded late. AFRAIDOFTHEBUNNY vied in opening strides then
chased the top pair around the turn, ran on to mid-stretch then gave way. CLASSY CROWE raced in the back throughout and steadily retreated.

KASA was forwardly placed soon after the start, moved up entering the turn and took over a slim lead from RAINBOW SUREBET, widened to a
commanding advantage in upper stretch and kept clear under drive. SHELBY TO raced in the back through early stages, chased two wide around the turn,
hustled along three wide into the lane, finished with good response and finished clearly second best. BARBED WIRE raced in contention along the inside,
tipped out moving through the turn and churned on for a share. CENTERFOLD chased two wide then took the inside, flattened around the turn and
continued to tire in the drive. RAINBOW SUREBET sped to the lead at the start, got collared by the winner late on the turn and steadily faded.

SWEET WHEAT set a pressured pace into the turn, held a slim lead going by the quarter pole then widened advantage in upper stretch, sustained response
under steady urging and held clear. WELLER ROGUE lacked speed and raced in the back, hustled along around the turn, urged three wide into the lane,
rallied and finished on equal terms for place. TEQUILA was unhurried and raced off the early speed, swung five wide into the lane, finished with good
response and finished on equal terms for place. MINISTRY OF ART raced off the clear top pair through the backstretch, was ridden along two wide around
the turn, sustained bid into the lane, closed the gap on the leader then got caught for runner ups spots in closing strides. KIDO'S SLING SHOT vied with the
eventual winner in opening stages and continued in striking distance around the turn then came up empty in upper stretch.

around the turn, sustained response into the lane and produced a solid finish. OUTLAW QUEEN sped to the lead at the start, continued on top under
pressure around the turn, dueled inside of JERI DAWN into the final furlong then weakened late. LITTLE MORE LOVE got bumped at the start then raced in
the last flight through the backstretch, chased two wide around the turn, tipped three wide for the drive and just missed show. RUN A FIRE raced in aim for
the lead at the quarter pole then faded in upper stretch. MOONSHINE LILY broke out and bumped with SWEET HOLINESS at the start, chased along the

Footnotes
LORD OF THE PALACE tracked the leader into the turn, launched a two wide bid at the quarter pole, vied outside of LAUNCHED into the final furlong then
took charge and finished going away. LANCELOT N ELAINE chased along the inside around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, briefly waited for a clear
path in upper stretch then got clear and ran on for place. CHINLEE raced off the early pace and four wide around the turn, hustled up entering the lane,
edged closer and got a nose up for show. LAUNCHED sped to the lead at the start, held firm around the turn, vied with the winner past the furlong marker
then came up empty. FOR ME LET IT BE hustled along four wide around the turn, ran on three to four wide through the lane and needed more for late
impact. MAFIA DON raced off the pace, shifted four wide in upper stretch and lacked a rally. STORMIN' J. J. raced three wide in range midway around the
turn then weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
MAKABIM settled through early stages then picked up the pace entering the far turn, circled up four wide at the quarter pole, cleared command turning for
home and kept clear under steady pressure. CASEYS MEMORY raced off the early pace, picked up the tempo four wide late on the far turn, sustained bid
into the lane, edged closer three wide and gained place. BUZZER was unhurried through the backstretch, launched a bid midway around the far turn, edged
closer and prevailed for a share. BROADWAY stalked the early pace, held a slim lead midway around the far turn, ran on into the lane then weakened in
final sixteenth. MAHOMES tracked in range through early stages, lacked racing around the far turn, got shuffled back, lost position and failed to rally in the
lane. TWO GUNS was ridden along three to four wide through the backstretch, was not too far back around the far turn then faded in the lane. PREGAME
stalked the pace through the backstretch and came up empty around the final turn. PINCH HITTER set the pace through the backstretch then faded around
the far turn and continued to tire in the drive. GRAND DESIGN raced in the back and steadily retreated.
