Footnotes
WILLING TO BURN saved ground setting the pace, lost the lead entering the stretch and dropped back, responded to pressure during the drive and came
again to prove narrowly best. COLLECTING STARS was bumped at the start by Smashing Success, then stalked the pace from along the outside, moved
up to take the lead entering the stretch, opened an advantage nearing the eighth pole, but was unable to resist the winner in the late stages. LOOKOUT
TAYLOR was reserved off the early pace, rallied three-wide the final quarter and finished strongly. COCOA CENTS was unhurried early, rallied four-wide
into the stretch and gained her best stride too late. KERRALIA saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, but lacked a rally. SMASHING
SUCCESS broke out to bump Collecting Stars, then dropped back and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
PISTOL POWER prompted the early pace from along the inside, dropped back slightly on the backstretch, angled to the outside nearing the half mile pole,
caught Mike Operator bearing the quarter pole, dueled with him from that point and prevailed in a stiff drive. MIKE OPERATOR set the early pace racing
two-wide, opened an advantage on the backstretch, angled out to the inside, responded when challenged nearing the quarter pole, couldn't resist the winner
late but continued on gamely to the wire. UPO saved ground while being reserved off the pace, slipped through during the drive and finished in a mild rally.
STEPHEN JAMES was allowed to settle in stride while racing two-wide, but lacked a rally when asked. HEY SEQUOIA was bothered brief and carried out
by the loose horse on the first turn, dropped back and failed to recover the lost ground. ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT failed to threaten while racing three-wide.
BRONZE WARRIOR stumbled badly at start to unseat his rider and walked off following the race. The stewards conducted a review of the start, but after
viewing the films made no change in the order of finish,

BRONY BOY was reserved off the early pace, rallied two-wide into the stretch and finished fast to be up in the final sixteenth. TUMAC MOUNTAIN vied for
the lead from along the outside, took command entering the stretch, opened a clear lead but was unable to resist the winner late. GOLDIE'S HILLS was
unhurried after bobbling at the start, moved up along the outside on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch and was making up ground late. ROUSING
RUBBLE showed early speed along the inside, steadied in tight nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, angled out three-wide, offered a bid nearing the stretch
and then weakened late. NORTHWEST RAIN dueled for the lead to the stretch while racing two-wide and tired. THE TRAINER OF ROUSING RUBBLE
LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER, BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF
