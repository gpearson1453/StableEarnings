FORGOTTEN VOWS raced close to the early pace, advanced on the backstretch run, overtook the pacesetter leaving the quarter pole, drove clear in
mid-stretch and pulled away in the late going while kept to task to the wire. PICK BYMY FRIEND bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled off of
the pace, improved position on the backstretch run, came three wide nearing the top of the stretch, was no match for the winner in the drive but stayed on to
get up for second in the final strides. TAM'S TIME settled in midpack off of the early pace, saved ground to the second turn, was unable to produce a late
rally and was just edged at the end for second, while well clear of the rest for third. CANDYBOX was sent to the early lead, set modest fractions through the
backstretch run, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and tired in the final stages. SUBITO SLEW settled off of the
early pace, lost position on the backstretch run and did not offer a late rally.

HALF HOPING was crowded a bit at the start and was off a step slowly, was hustled outside of rivals to the turn, made a four wide move nearing the top of
the lane, loomed in upper stretch, closed with a rush through the lane and got up in the final strides to prevail. ALL tracked the moderate early pace,
advanced in upper stretch, took the lead in deep stretch, was not able to hold off the quickly oncoming winner in the final stages but held for second in the
end. AUSTRIAN NAVY rated off of the early pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out in upper stretch, came within aim nearing the sixteenth-marker
and was outfinished late, while clear for third. GEMMA ROYAL was asked to show early speed and set moderate fractions through the turn, was not able to
hold off oncoming rivals nearing the furlong marker and gave way in the late stages. PULPIT SINGER tracked the early pace, lost position three wide on the
turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
MAGICAL THOUGHT was sent leaving the break and took the early lead to the first turn, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was set down
for the drive, was confronted by BANDEENA inside of the furlong marker, drifted out under firm left-handed urging in the final sixteenth and gamely held for
the win. BANDEENA attended to the moderate pace to the second turn, advanced in mid-stretch to confront MAGICAL THOUGHT, was carried out by that
rival in deep stretch, dueled to the wire and was denied for the win at the end, while well clear of the rest for second. CASINO GAMES steadied in tight
entering the first turn, settled through moderate fractions on the backstretch run, gained ground three wide on the far turn, was outkicked by the top two in
the stretch run but stayed on to be clear for third. NORTHERN ROSE settled off of the pace, saved ground to the second turn and did not mount a late rally.
ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) rated off of the pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn and was not a factor in
the stretch run. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN INVOLVING MAGICAL THOUGHT AND BANDEENA, AND IN A
UNANIMOUS DECISION THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
AWE was unhurried early on, came four wide while trailing into the backstretch run, advanced four wide on the second turn, angled out in upper stretch to
go five wide into the drive, closed fast in deep stretch and made a good late push to get up in time for the win. EARNEST rated off of the early pace while
saving ground, waited for racing room while in tight leaving the three-furlong marker, was steered three wide into the stretch run, split foes inside of the
furlong marker, rallied in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while getting up for second. MAXINAMILLION settled off of the early pace, improved
position on the backstretch run, continued that advance on the second turn, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, could not match strides with the top
two in the final sixteenth and was outfinished, while holding safely for third. SLEEP OVER came three wide into the first turn while tracking the pace,
maintained position through the backstretch run, advanced four wide on the second turn, vied for the lead in upper stretch and was outkicked late in the
drive. KALINE stalked the decent early pace, advanced on the pacesetter and took command into the far turn, came under pressure nearing mid-stretch and
gave way in the final sixteenth. DI LAURIAN was hustled to the early lead, set decent fractions through the backstretch run, could not keep pace into the
second turn and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
POLACCO broke alertly and sped to the early lead, was engaged by RICKENBACHER and dueled with that one into the turn, shook clear approaching the
quarter marker, extended the lead in mid-stretch, shied away from firm handling in deep stretch and kept to task in the end to prevail. VANDENBERG
bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the pace from the inside through the turn, closed willingly in the final furlong, could not reel in the
winner late but was second best at the end. ONE BROAD STREET tracked the early pace, lost ground on the turn, re-rallied in deep stretch, could not catch
the top two late but was an easy third. NINE HUNDRED DAYS lacked early speed and chased the pace to the turn, trailed to mid-stretch and offered a mild
late rally. RICKENBACHER was off slowly then was hustled to show early speed, dueled with POLACCO into the turn, could not keep pace with that one
approaching the quarter marker, dropped back in mid-stretch and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY AROUSAL was crowded at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to be close to the early pace, lost ground into the second turn and was
in tight nearing the quarter marker, shifted out to go four wide into the stretch run and closed determinedly in the final sixteenth to prevail. MASHHAD
FLATS stalked the early pace three wide into the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, vied for the lead as part of a three-way duel
nearing the quarter-marker, struck the front in upper stretch, met the bid of HOLIDAY AROUSAL in the final sixteenth but was bested by that foe late and
held for second. SYNC settled three wide off of the early pace, was unhurried through the backstretch run, made a three wide bid into the drive, could not
reel in the top pair in the late stages but was an easy third at the end. WALKING BOSS was off a bit slowly, settled off of the early pace, pulled along the
backstretch and made a middle move to vied for the lead nearing the half-mile marker, dueled for the lead to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper
stretch and faded. GALLANT OAK was hard sent away from the break and took the lead into the first turn, set decent fractions while pressured through the
backstretch run, dueled on the front end to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

GENTLEMAN'S SECRET broke out at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the early pace, ranged up four wide on the turn, took command in upper
stretch, was kept to task through the lane while on the left lead and held in a drive to prevail. HULA KING bobbled at the start, the rider lost his irons in the
first furlong but recovered nearing the turn, rallied along the inside approaching the top of the lane and was outfinished by the winner in the drive, while just
holding for second. KING EDDIE bobbled at the start and was off slowly, chased the pace through the turn, swung widest into the drive and found his best
stride late, just missing for second at the end while holding safely for third. POTENTE ALBA was asked to show early speed and raced close up to the early
moderate pace, gained ground three wide on the turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and was outfinished in the late stages. OFFICER OF WAR was
hustled to the early lead, set moderate fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. CASH LIMIT
