Footnotes
O CIGANO soon shared the lead from outside, moved clear and stayed in path three on the turn, drifted out some upper stretch, was corrected then held off
FLASHY RICHIE under steady handling. FLASHY RICHIE broke somewhat slowly, progressed two wide on the turn, fanned out some leaving the bend,
rallied to engage O CIGANO from inside after entering the last furlong, lacked the extra needed but was easily second best. BUBBA CABALLO in the
second flight from inside, was steadied briefly into the turn, angled out some leaving the bend and improved position late between horses. CHRISTMAS
PRESENT was checked and altered out to avoid a fallen rider into the turn, stayed wide through the bend and showed a willingness to run late. TIZRIK
displayed early speed between rivals, angled in entering the bend, did not stay with O CIGANO and faded for the drive. CRAPS SHOOTER vied for the lead
from inside, clipped TIZRIK'S heels into the turn, stumbled and lost his rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into CRAPS SHOOTER'S stumble into the turn.
After their review, no action was taken.

Footnotes
MAC PANDOWDY shared the lead from outside, drew away when allowed on the bend, was put to urging upper stretch and kept BRIANS WAY at bay.
BRIANS WAY caught in close quarters just after the break, jostled with AFTER MY BROTHER then was bumped solidly by CAMARGO leaving the chute,
circled rivals on the bend, closed the gap too late deep stretch but was clearly second best. AFTER MY BROTHER jostled between rivals at the start, was
checked leaving the chute, was two wide on the turn, advanced along the rail upper stretch then could only hold his position late. CAMARGO broke in
somewhat then continued to angle in, bumped solidly with BRIANS WAY leaving the chute then bumped solidly with ASTI SKY at the eleven-sixteenths
marker, prompted the pace, did not keep up three wide on the turn and leveled off for the stretch run. SAFE also jostled with AFTER MY BROTHER at the
start, lost ground taking the turn and had no late bid. ASTI SKY was bumped after travelling the first sixteenth, recovered well to contest the pace inside,
gave way on the bend, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
MOON PIES IMAGE fractious in the gate, was rated from outside once the race began, angled in on the bend, picked up her pace, angled out three wide
upper stretch and took over with seventy yards left. TENSE shared the lead just outside HEAVENLY SCENT, rallied to gain the advantage in the lane,
floated out some after entering the last furlong then did not have enough left in the waning yards. COWGIRL FRANKIE chased from between horses, was
two wide taking the turn and rallied belatedly. SILVER EYES raced in contention from outside, came four wide into the stretch and found best stride too late.
RAINY MOUNTAIN was soon well back, angled in to be two wide on the turn then failed to have a significant stretch bid. HEAVENLY SCENT displayed
early speed from inside but gave way for the drive. FREEDOM ATTACK was a step slow at the start and was not a factor in a ground-saving trip.

RONAN angled in midway on the backstretch, bumped with SUPERTRIX after a quarter mile, progressed on the bend, split rivals three wide nearing the last
furlong, took over inside the eighth pole and held off MIND YOUR OWN under urging. MIND YOUR OWN hesitated at the break, advanced to race in

SHE TAKES FLIGHT pressed three or four wide, edged ahead near the final eighth but could not sustain her bid late. TOUCH BY FELICTY broke outward,
bumped solidly with SNOOTY, moved up from inside to contest the pace, faded the final eighth and was vanned off lame. SNOOTY broke a bit inward,
bumping solidly with TOUCH BY FELICTY, vied for the lead between horses, edged ahead two wide on the turn but gave way the last furlong. LAKE
BARKLEY was an early factor from outside but faded from inside after three furlongs. SUPERTRIX moved to the inside early on, bumped with RONAN after
two furlongs, was just off the rail taking the turn and had no late bid.

FAST JACK broke outward, bumping BRAVO BRAVO, was hustled to the early lead, challenged from inside midway on the backstretch, gradually angled in
after two furlongs, moved clear on the bend then widened command under a drive the last furlong. LOCAMOTOR advanced to vie for the lead inside FAST
JACK, was checked as his path narrowed nearing the seven-sixteenths marker, checked again approaching the three-eighths pole, came off the rail some
for the stretch run, was no match for FAST JACK but proved clearly second best. D'FEVER prominent from outside, was two wide on the turn, floated out
some for the stretch run, gradually drifted out as he wore down but lasted for third. BRAVO BRAVO was bumped from both sides at the break, showed no
speed, was two wide on the bend, angled out upper stretch and was closing in for third late. CHICKS FOR FREE broke inward, also bumping BRAVO
BRAVO, trailed, angled in on the turn and made up minor ground deep stretch. TAP'S BIG SHOT three to four wide nearly all the way, came up empty for
the drive. The rider of LOCAMOTOR lodged an objection alleging interference from FAST JACK into the turn. After the stewards' review, the foul claim was
not upheld.

KHOZAN'S SUCCESS gradually progressed from outside to engage SHANGHAI POINT upper stretch and shook the latter off nearing the final sixteenth.
SHANGHAI POINT sent to a clear lead, showed the way just off or along the rail, was challenged from outside in the lane, wore down inside the last furlong
but was unchallenged for the place. TWO WORLDS advanced just off the inside on the backstretch, had the rail taking the second turn, was no match for
the top pair when set down for the drive but proved easily best of the others. MKAR THE FAST raced in contention three wide for nearly six furlongs then
steadily yielded. ARCHIEMYBOY retreated from between horses on the first turn, stayed toward the outside and showed little. ONE PUTT RICHIE was well
placed from inside for five furlongs then gave way.

Footnotes
ONE WAY HOME broke alertly, soon shared the lead inside rivals, had the rail on the bend, floated out some into the lane, his rider lost his whip midstretch,
steadily bore out under hand urging after that and narrowly held on. D'ARCHER stumbled at the start, bumping RAHFEE TOWN, quickly recovered to vie for
the lead outside the latter, angled in beside ONE WAY HOME on the turn, fought in the stretch, was steadily forced out the final furlong and just missed.
FIXICO settled outside, commenced his bid after a quarter mile to reach contention three wide on the turn, drifted out upper stretch, was straightened,
rallied, altered out late to keep a clear path outside D'ARCHER and was too late. W W RUSSIAN GOLD advanced three wide on the bend, made a strong
move inside rivals the last furlong, also came up short but was easily best of the others. CHERNYAHOVSKIY pressed the early pace but faded two wide on
the turn. RAHFEE TOWN displayed early speed between horses, began to retreat into the bend, moved to the rail and steadily gave way. GOLDENPENCE
steadily gave way, was eased in the lane and walked off. There was a stewards' inquiry into the deep stretch portion of the race and the rider of D'ARCHER
lodged an objection claiming interference from ONE WAY HOME inside the final furlong. After their review, the stewards disqualified ONE WAY HOME and
placed him second for bearing out and impeding D'ARCHER.
