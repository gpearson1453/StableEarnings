Footnotes
SHAMAN'S PRODIGY was urged inside a rival prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, continued in a prolonged drive nearest the rail
through the stretch but narrowly prevailed under firm right handed pressure. SCARRAZANO tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn,
tipped out three wide in upper stretch while being roused to advance and just failed to edge the winner. U SO MONEY BABY was urged forcing the pace
outside a rival from the outset into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair. INNOVATE tracked off the
first flight outside a rival racing in the three path into the turn, was urged to advance while being fanned four wide midstretch and faded late. TIMBER LADY
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LOOKIN SO LUCKY tracked off the second flight three deep racing to the backstretch, responded with a steady advance in that path nearing upper stretch,
then wrested the advantage in the final sixteenth under firm encouragement. ACCORDING TO ASPEN was rated between foes in second flight, swung four
wide into upper stretch and continued with interest to edge rivals narrowly for the place honors. Y NOT SIZZLE stalked off the first flight along the inside
racing into the far turn, tipped off the inside in upper stretch while being urged to challenge for command but had no final kick. MAD GRACE, off slowly,
tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, briefly awaited an opening nearing the lane, altered course when caught in close
quarters to bid three wide between foes in late stretch but was outkicked for share. PLUMA, urged dictating the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to
the backstretch, kicked clear on the far turn, held sway to upper stretch but gave out late. EMBARRASSING was settled last to the backstretch, swung out
entering upper stretch but offered no rally. GOOD MONGOLIA was urged prompting the pace outside a rival from the outset to the second bend, gave way
nearing the lane.

MAGOO, urged prompting the pace outside a rival from the outset to the far turn, edged forward racing into upper stretch, then kicked clear under pressure
and was taken in hand approaching the wire. WESTONS WILDCAT, urged along the inside disputing the pace into the backstretch, dueled grudgingly
through the far turn to midstretch but yielded to the winner late. TONKA WARRIOR, pulling a bit tracking off the first flight along the inside in the opening
half, tipped out three wide racing into upper stretch and finished evenly while being outkicked for the place honors. QUANTUM LEAP, caught in the four

LOOKIN FOR EIGHT, forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter in the opening six furlongs, was urged to press the issue between foes racing into the third
turn, continued in a protracted skirmish past midstretch and edged forward under firm encouragement. STITZY settled outside foes for the opening six
furlong, advanced on the leaders four wide nearing the third bend, pressed the issue three wide into upper stretch to strike the front but was outkicked.
ZUMURUDEE, reserved along the inside in the opening half, gained position inside foes after five furlongs, tipped out racing into the third bend to gain
position between foes, then continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair while prevailing for a share. NOBLE PURSUIT was rated between foes in the
opening mile, angled to the inside racing into the third bend, saved ground to the lane and finished evenly late. ITS A BOY sped to the lead along the inside
in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the third turn, dueled inside the top pair to upper stretch but gave way late. BUDRO
TALKING, reserved last in the opening six furlongs, switched outside foes with a half mile to go but had no closing bid. ROBINSON tracked off the first flight
along the inside racing through two turns and faded after six furlongs. FLATOUT WINNER tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and steadily
faded nearing the third bend. TALLESTOFTHETALL tracked off the first flight three wide for six furlongs and emptied out abruptly nearing the third turn.

Footnotes
VOODOO FIRE was settled well off the leaders while angling inwards in the opening stages, gradually gathered momentum shifting out nearing upper
stretch, split foes three wide midstretch and produced a stout rally to just edge NOEL'S ANGEL in time under strong handling. The latter broke sharply,
sprinted clear of the field while angling to the inside, held sway on a commanding margin past midstretch, lost some momentum late and just missed when it
appeared her rider misjudged the wire. I CINC EYE LUV U tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing to the turn, shifted out three wide in
upper stretch and continued willingly between foes to close the gap while prevailing for a share. RUNNERS HEAT angled to the inside tracking off the
second flight racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch gaining some position but was outkicked for a share. EXODUS AND HOPE settled off the
second flight outside foes early, angled five wide racing into upper stretch to gain position but made no impact. ROSEHILL ROAD tracked the pacesetter
four wide in second flight racing into the turn and faded into upper stretch. SWEET SECRET tracked the pacesetter three wide between foes into the turn
and faded in the drive. CHARLIES MISSILE, urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, emptied out entering upper stretch. LITTLE LUNA
proved no factor. FAST N FEARLESS trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JACKIES IRISHDREAM was rated off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch and produced a steady late
response to wear down OFF RAMP in time under firm handling. The latter, urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, edged forward
between calls in late stages but just failed to contain the winner. BETTY'S BAR angled inwards to press the pace between foes through the backstretch,
forced the issue outside a rival to upper stretch and weakened late. CHAI TEA was rated off the second flight along the inside in the opening stages, saved
ground to upper stretch and continued evenly inside foes late. HAMAZING LACE tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing to the turn, was
fanned four wide nearing upper stretch and faded in the drive. WAR MUSIC stumbled at the start dropping out last early and never gained contention.
CHRISTMAS POEM flashed brief pace three wide pressing the leaders on the backstretch but emptied out racing into the bend.

MIA BABY broke readily, was urged clear along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the bend, shifted out racing into upper stretch and held
sway on a comfortable margin to the end while being kept to pressure. SUMMER FIREFLYS tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight racing into
the bend, lost some position entering the turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prove best of the others.
SWIRLING WINE, forwardly placed three wide stalking the pacesetter into the bend, shifted inwards nearing upper stretch and finished evenly between foes
late while earning a share. CHAOS MAGIC, forwardly placed between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the bend, shifted to the rail racing through the turn
and faded in the drive. NINE CROWNS was rated outside rivals in second flight racing to the turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and lacked the
needed late bid. WREXHAM brushed the gate while breaking slowly, angled to the inside tracking behind the second flight racing into the turn but had no
closing bid. UP YOUR GAME was rated off the first flight between foes racing to the turn but retreated early. MISS TATER TOT, caught in close quarters
just after the break, then held up early, raced wide to the stretch and proved no threat.

COUGER, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace, pressed the issue on the turn to wrest the advantage, shook clear racing into upper stretch and was
kept to firm encouragement. BRAHMS IS WHO tracked outside rivals in second flight, advanced three wide racing to upper stretch and proved best of the
others. BRIAR THICKET, off slowly, angled to the inside early, saved ground on the bend, then tipped out to gain some position between foes. ALL NATIVE
settled between foes in the last flight racing to the turn and offered no rally. INTHEMISTYMOONLITE, urged to the lead a bit off the rail, dueled for
command into the turn and gave way. NAVARONES SPARKLE ducked out at the start, made brief pursuit off the leaders off the inside racing through the
backstretch but emptied out early.

Footnotes
AND ISLES, brushed at the start, was righted to track just off the leaders between foes racing into the bend, shifted out three wide in upper stretch while
being roused to challenge, gained the advantage midstretch, then repelled a challenge from STONE ARCH BRIDGE in the closing stages to prevail under
firm right handed encouragement. The latter was settled last along the inside in the opening quarter, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch while
advancing readily on the leaders, drifted inwards under right handed pressure racing past the sixteenth marker while looming outside the winner but couldn't
match terms with that foe in the final strides. FROST WARRIOR, pulling inside foes tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening three sixteenths, shifted
off the inside entering the turn, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch brushing STONE ARCH BRIDGE while being roused to challenge between
foes, was held up momentarily when losing her path nearing the sixteenth marker but continued well enough to earn a share. OLIVIAN, caught in tight
quarters at the start, was righted to gain a forward placing three deep tracking just off the leader, shifted in to press that foe on the turn, dueled between
foes into the lane but weakened through the last furlong. KNIGHT'S HONOR ducked in at the start crossing into the path of OLIVIAN, was righted to track
off the first flight outside foes racing to the turn but emptied out racing into the stretch. NAUGHTYNAUGHTY hopped at the start losing position to the field,
switched outside a rival in early stages but offered no rally. GHOST OF GENEVIEVE, restless in the gate prior to the start, was urged along the inside
dictating the pace on a narrow margin, dueled for command racing into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF
FROST WARRIOR LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDERS OF AND ISLES AND STONE ARCH BRIDGE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN
LATE STRETCH, BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED. HEART ON THE RUN WAS FRACTIOUS IN THE GATE PRIOR TO THE START,
NECESSITATING HER LATE SCRATCH.

Footnotes
YAK came through close quarters in the opening stages to gain terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival into the backstretch, pressed the issue on the
far turn to wrest a clear advantage racing into upper stretch and went clear under firm left handed pressure. BIG LEAGUE BENNY, in touch with the leaders
three wide between foes attending the pace to the backstretch, was eased off the leaders while shifting out five wide approaching the far turn, then
continued in that path to late stages to prevail for the place honors late. SHOTGUN RIDER, caught five wide while prompted to contend racing into the first
turn, raced just off the leaders on the backstretch, lodge a brief, four wide bid entering the second bend but flattened out into the lane.
HECOULDGOALLTHEWAY, urged to the lead while angling to the inside setting the pace on a narrow margin into the first turn, dueled for command inside
the eventual winner into the far turn and faded in the drive. BUXTERHOOTER broke awkwardly and never gained contention. ALLEYCAT, urged to contend
four wide, then three wide between foes for the opening five furlongs, faded between foes racing into the far turn. MOST SANDISFACTORY, pulling a bit
against restraint tracking just off the first flight along the inside racing to the far turn, emptied out into the lane.
