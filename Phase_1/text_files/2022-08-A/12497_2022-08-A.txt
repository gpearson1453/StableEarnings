WONNEFRAC was hustled from the outside, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path through the stretch was much the best. NO EASY ROAD
showed speed from the inside, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held place. SILVER SIGNATURE was off the pace,
had a mild gain on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch and finished well. WAR DOCTOR was up close and raced evenly on the turn but from the
five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. SECTION TEN was unhurried early and roused on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the
stretch had no response.

Footnotes
SOFIA'S SLUGGER was away alertly and set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and proved best. FEDERAL LAW showed no speed, saved ground on
the turn and was up for place. HARD N'SWEET stalked the early leaders and had a good position on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
evened out. BRADY O'BRADY was in touch and hustled along on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. TOMCAT BLACK
was unhurried early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. CALL ME WALLY was in range but chased on
the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty. PER RULING FROM THE ONTARIO RACING COMMISSION, FEDERAL LAW WAS
DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

early leader, was a factor on the turn and vied from the four path through the stretch but was outfinished. HONEY GIRL had no speed, was roused on the
turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch rallied late. DANCE FOR GOLD set the pace and had a clear lead on the turn but had nothing left.
FLAWLESS PINK was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no kick. MAHONE BAY was well back,
showed little and was not a factor. FAIRY was off the pace, showed nothing and was not a threat.
