Footnotes
RIDGEPOINTE set a pressured pace in the two path, then shook clear on the turn and then turned back the bid from TRUSTYOURINSTINCT leaving the
turn, and drew off in the stretch to prove much the best under a mild drive. TRUSTYOURINSTINCT was off slowly, then settled three wide and made a three
wide bid on the turn to move into contention by the quarter pole, but flattened out, clearly second best. RUNANDHIDE WIND chased the early pace two
wide, then shifted out to be four wide on the turn, but came up empty in the lane, bested rest. BUTTONED UP pressed the early pace three wide, then
dropped to the inside on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
SAPONARA tracked the early pace and made a four wide bide on the turn to move into contention, then continued that bid in the lane to edge away late to
score the victory under a drive. SHED A TEAR tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and then dueled with the pace setter by the
furlong marker, edged clear of that rival but was outfinished by the winner, second best. GOLDEN AVIEATOR set the early pace on the inside while clear,
was headed leaving the three sixteenths and faded the final furlong, held show award. SNOW CANDY was settled back early, came seven wide into the
lane and had a good late rally, missed show award. BASTIEN LE BROWN was allowed to settle early, shifted off the rail on the turn, steadied slightly
nearing the quarter pole, then came three wide into then lane and had a belated rally. FROST'S SONG chased the early pace between horses and three
wide and weakened. JAIME JAMEL chased the pace between horses and two wide and weakened. OXBOW WIND failed to menace. OPUS EQUUS was
not a factor. MY BEAU chased the pace on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
WHERESTHEPASSION was taken back early, shifted to the outside on the turn and advanced five to six wide on the turn, came widest into the lane, closed
well and surged late to get up in time under a drive to score the win. VALIANT GABE set the early pace and drew out on the turn and was three wide into
the lane, remained clear by the furlong marker but was caught and denied on the wire to just miss. CONNECTING was allowed to settle early, then was
blocked and steadied slightly by the five sixteenths, then made a inside bid leaving the turn but needed more late while slowly gaining. SIR PEEL tracked
the early pace on the inside, then eased off the inside on the turn and came four wide into the drive, was slowly gaining but hung in deep stretch. LUNAR
ROCKET chased the pace and was four wide on the turn and weakened. MARCEL failed to menace. ROCKIN FREEBEE stalked the pace three wide and
weakened. BOYD'S BAND was away alertly then got rank and hard to handle and was wide and far back early, no factor.
