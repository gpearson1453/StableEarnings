RB WHISTLIN DIXIE chased the early pace while inside then rallied two wide in upper stretch, closed late and was up in time in the final strides. RB
MUNCHIE set a pressured pace while two wide into the turn, was in a long drive but could not last in the final strides. WMA BIG BABY was well placed while
three wide into the turn, made a bid on the turn to late stretch but came up empty in the end. PAMS MASQUERADE stalked the pace while inside into the
turn, made a bid three wide in upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. SOUTHERN BELL MHF was unhurried early then raced inside in the stretch and
was no threat.
