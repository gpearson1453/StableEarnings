Footnotes
GILCREASE was well placed behind the embattled leaders, came under urging in the two path early on the turn, rallied between foes into upper stretch,
closed well to get the lead inside the furlong marker then moved clear under steady urging. SCARPIA bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled,
contested the pace on the inside of his stablemate, vied along the rail on the turn, was set down while in front into the stretch, led under a drive into the final
furlong then was overtaken while able to get the place. CERTIFIED LOVERBOY was urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, came under
the crop inside the five-sixteenths, was driven four wide past the quarter-pole then carried out some in upper stretch, pursued the leader under a drive into
the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while able to secure the show. MO'S TREASURE came away at the front of the field, dropped back while
allowed to settle off the pace, was allowed to fall back late on the backstretch and lost position, went three wide around the turn, was roused in the vicinity of
the five-sixteenths, angled out while asked for his best in upper stretch and finished with late energy while improving position. CLASSIC CREATION came
out at the start then bumped with a foe, saved ground at the rear of the field, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. CHIRINGO was
bumped on both sides while last to commence, settled towards the rear, steadied while shuffled back behind BLUE LIEUTENANT inside the
seven-sixteenths, was roused near the three-eighths, gained under a drive into upper stretch but flattened out and lacked the needed response. BLUE
LIEUTENANT was urged along off the pace, dropped back while inside on the turn and came up empty. TALKIN PHAROAH hit the inside of the gate at the
start, disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path while asked on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch then drifted out and capitulated.

Footnotes
BLUE JAYS chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch advancing
latched on the leader, dug in under a drive taking narrow command a furlong out, dueled through to the finish in game fashion holding command to the
finish. GOOD SKATE coaxed from the start, showed the way rated along the inside, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch under threat to the
outside, got displaced from command narrowly a furlong out and dueled through to the finish battling on to the end while clear of the rest for the place
honors. CRITICAL THREAT coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside patiently handled until let out taking the inside route into upper stretch, then
weakened in the drive. THE BIG GREY coaxed from the gate, chased four wide until tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. MAJESTIC TIGER three wide in pursuit, got ridden along at the three-eighths, angled
five wide into upper stretch, tired. CONVERTIBLE FREEZE broke out at the start a beat slow, chased just off the inside and was under a hard hold off heels
of CRITICAL THREAT when pulling on the bit in the early stages down the backstretch, settled five furlongs from home, entered the far turn just off the
inside before getting out to be six to seven wide three furlongs from home despite a right handed crop, angled back in to swing six wide into upper stretch
and made no impact.

GOODNIGHT OLIVE came outward while breaking in front, showed speed on the inside of foes then was eased back outside the five-eighths, moved out
behind the leading trio shortly thereafter, went three wide early on the turn, angled five wide while asked outside the five-sixteenths, gained to make an
outside bid approaching the quarter-pole, swept to the lead while drifting inward into upper stretch, moved clear while drifting in more outside the furlong
marker, was given one pop of a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then placed under a hand-ride to the wire while much the best. DR B came
outward at the start, disputed the pace on the outside of a rival while loosely between horses, vied in the three path around the turn, led past the
five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and proved no match while able to get the place. PIECE OF MY HEART charged the
front of the gate just prior to the start, hit the front and popped open her stall doors just prior to the rest of the field, lunged inward and bumped hard with a
foe, spotted the front a few lengths, settled on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed
response while up for the show. LIBERTY M D was bumped hard at the start then checked sharply, angled in at the rear, saved ground on the turn, shifted
three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. FOUETTE was bumped hard at the start then forced strongly into another opponent, came outward while
recovering, moved up to press the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the four path around the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. DEALING
JUSTICE lost her footing slightly at the start then was carried out while hustled, moved up to dispute the pace on the inside of two foes, vied along the rail
while still inside of rivals on the turn, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths and faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, PIECE
OF MY HEART WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED LAST FOR BREAKING OPEN THE FRONT OF HER STALL DOORS PRIOR TO THE
REST OF THE FIELD. ALL TIMES WERE HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE AND PROVIDED BY NYRA

Footnotes
NAUGHTY GAL dueled from the two path early on with PROMISE OF HOPE with APPLE PICKER latched on her inside pressing the issue along the rail,
shook away into the turn floating briefly to the three path near the three-eighths before tucking back to be just off the inside, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole and got out six wide at that station into upper stretch, dug in under a drive, the rider vigorous with the left rein and drifted out three to four
additional paths while holding clear to the finish kept to task. JANIS JOPLIN two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
continued two to three wide into upper stretch before tipping out to the three or four path, dug in under a drive coming inwards to near the rail inside the
eighth pole while running on to chase the winner home and just held for the place honors over a late closing rival. SABRA TUFF chased along the inside
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and had JANIS JOPLIN drift in front, tipped out near
the sixteenth pole and offered up a mild kick closing belatedly to miss for the place honors. APPLE PICKER forwardly placed prompting the top pair along
the inside in the early stages, got shaken off into the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped to the two path with five-sixteenths to go and
paused briefly spinning just off the inside into upper stretch as JANIS JOPLIN came inwards in front, tipped out to the four path straightened away and
weakened to the finish. DAMASO four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued four wide into upper stretch and faltered.
PROMISE OF HOPE hustled from the gate, dueled from the three path briefly with NAUGHTY GAL to her inside, got shaken off a bit nearing the turn,
bobbled ever so slightly and had the rider sense something amiss getting placed to a protective hold at the seven-sixteenths, was eased up before being
pulled in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths and was subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
RAGING SEA settled just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, rallied three wide with a clear path between foes into upper stretch, closed well
to make a bid inside the three-sixteenths, battled inside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth, gained the advantage five strides from the wire and
prevailed under strong handling. PEACE CRUISER stalked the pace on the outside, ranged up four wide to make a bid on the turn, was roused at the
quarter-pole, took the lead in upper stretch, fought outside of the winner from inside the three-sixteenths, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while
well clear for the place. RENEGADE REBEL settled off the pace, went three then four wide around the turn, was roused late on that bend, came five wide
into the stretch, pursued the top two into the final furlong and proved no match for those opponents while clear for the show. WILL BE FAMOUS broke in
and hit the gate, settled off the pace, moved in some around the nine-sixteenths then drifted out outside the half-mile pole, lugged out five wide around the
turn, was roused while getting much closer late on that bend, came six wide into the stretch under a drive, held a reasonable striking position into the final
furlong but came up empty. MO SHIRO settled on the outside, started the turn in the two path, shifted four wide while roused near the five-sixteenths and
failed to respond. BISSET pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, gained the lead into the stretch then lost the advantage to the
runner-up near the three-sixteenths and gave way. MARIA FROM MIAMI was hustled from the start, settled in a good position down the backstretch, saved
ground under urging on the turn and had nothing left. TRIBAL QUEEN was hustled from the gate, set the pace under pressure from her outside, vied inside
to the two path while asked on the turn, lost the lead into the stretch and faded. MIRUS dropped well back, raced inside to the two path on the turn and
showed little. SENIOR PROM QUEEN dropped well behind while taking short strides and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
WITH THE MOONLIGHT (IRE) was washy pre-race, tossed hear head some while crowded and bumping with a foe early, moved out some before the first
turn, went around the opening bend in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside without cover while tugging at the bit, engaged the leader in the two
path on the far turn, took the lead while floating five wide at the quarter-pole, responded well when put to a left-handed crop while still on her inside lead in
upper stretch, inched away into the final furlong, remained on her inside lead into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong handling. MCKULICK

around the first turn, was reserved off the pace while given cover, ranged up three wide on the far turn, was given her cue near the quarter-pole, chased the
winner under a drive in the stretch and was out-kicked while narrowly able to get the place. NEW YEAR'S EVE broke out and bumped hard with a foe, was
taken under a tight hold early, tugged keenly at the bit while inside through the first turn, raced under vigorous restraint while rank from the three-quarter
pole to outside the five-eighths, saved ground while leveling out around the far turn, moved to the two path late on that bend, was asked for her best into
upper stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong, fought between foes in the final sixteenth and just missed the place while able to get third.
CONTEMPORARY ART lost her footing slightly at the start but broke even with the front, moved in while going to the lead and tightened it up on foes to her
inside early, showed the way on the inside with an uncontested advantage, controlled the action around the far turn, was asked while being headed by the
winner at the quarter-pole and gave way. OAKHURST was taken under tight restraint early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was hard held at the rear,

Footnotes
COLORFUL MISCHIEF four then three wide just off the duel early on remained just off the top pair three wide through the turn before tucking to the two path
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths through the latter portion of the bend, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a
challenge through the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to the finish to prevail. WICKED HOT dueled early on from the three path with PORTILLA to
her outside while lightly coaxed along, shook off that rival enough to be under pressure from her while no longer knocking heads into the turn remaining
three wide until tucked to the two path nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, shook off PORTILLA straightened away now
confronted by EMPIRE HOPE, dug in under a right handed stick trying to lug in a bit when not switching leads a furlong out, rebuffed that challenge inside
the sixteenth marker, then got caught in the final strides to the finish in a good effort. BIG CITY MOMMA five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick closing in
belatedly to secure the show honors. EMPIRE HOPE broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through
the turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied up the rail offering a bid latching on to the leader a
furlong out, got repelled by that rival a sixteenth from home and flattened out in the late stages. PORTILLA stumbled at the start and recovered to duel early
on from the five path with WICKED HOT to her inside, got shaken off a bit into the turn and pressed the pace four then three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away and weakened to the finish. ROOKERY broke in brushing the near side
stall, then got steadied when losing her lane after the start conceding four lengths to the front, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. TO A T got bumped between foes and steadied out just after the start when losing her lane
and conceded three to four lengths to the front, chased three then two wide under coaxing from half mile pole, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch
and tired. BOSS CARA chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out and tired.

Footnotes
OUR FLASH DRIVE went four wide around the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the outside, traveled three wide around the far turn, was asked four
wide into the stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths then took the lead, responded well into the final furlong, drifted in some under a
left-handed crop around the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. PLUM ALI was asked leaving the gate then taken in hand early, saved ground
while rated just off the pace, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, dropped in while asked for her best in upper stretch, chased against the rail into
the final furlong and finished with good courage to garner the place. LOVE AND THUNDER (IRE) was taken under a tight hold early then reserved on the
inside, saved ground under vigorous restraint behind foes on the final turn, was beaten to a rail opening by PLUM ALI into upper stretch, waited while
blocked from the three-sixteenths to inside the furlong marker, altered out for room approaching the sixteenth-pole then was roused between foes and
finished well to just get the show but lost all chance at victory. IN GOOD SPIRITS bobbled at the start but recovered quickly, went to the front, rounded the
first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch with some company to her outside, vied inside on the far turn, spun into the two path under
pressure turning into the stretch, lost the advantage inside the three-sixteenths, fought into the final furlong and was outfinished then just missed the trifecta.
ASSERTIVE STYLE brushed with a foe early then moved in, went three wide under tight restraint on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, raced three
wide on the far turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch, pursued the vanguard while outside in the stretch and lacked
the needed kick. JOUSTER was taken up a bit while rank into the first turn, went around that bend in the three path, stalked the pace on the outside, vied in
the two path on the far turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, battled between horses into the final furlong and weakened. NAZUNA (IRE) was hard
held while slipping from the inside to the two path around the first turn, raced in the back half of the field under a hold, traveled in the two path around the far
turn, was asked three wide into the stretch and came up empty. STUNNING PRINCESS broke out and hit the gate, brushed with a rival early, rounded the
first turn in the two path, was reserved at the back, came under urging in the two path on the far turn and failed to respond.
