Footnotes
KNIGHT COMMANDER was forwardly placed in opening stages then roused forward and dueled three deep around the turn, battled on with SMART N
INTUITIVE through the lane, dug in gamely under firm handling and edged away. SMART N INTUITIVE prompted the pace then advanced to duel for the
lead leaving the backstretch, dueled between rivals around the turn, continued to battle for command with KNIGHT COMMANDER into the final furlong then
failed to match strides in final stages. YEARS FLY BY was ridden along off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, tipped two to three wide for the
drive and got up late for show. RED WHITE AND LOUD raced off the top trio entering the turn, chased three to four wide into upper stretch and got edged
late for show. SNAP'N TAP led the way in opening stages then came under attack leaving the backstretch, dueled inside a duo around the turn then
weakened in the lane.

finished going away. DERONDA was off a step slow at the start and continued to settle in the back, edged closer along the rail late on the far turn, tipped
two to three wide for the drive and gained second best. FLIRTATIOUS SMILE vied for the lead with HOT CAVIAR through the backstretch, shook free
midway around the far turn, got collared by the eventual winner in upper stretch and weakened. HOT CAVIAR vied inside of FLIRTATIOUS SMILE through
the backstretch, chased inside around the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane then faded in the final furlong. CAMCORDIA raced midpack along the
outside, hustled up three wide around the far turn and failed to move on in the lane. ANIME DAY settled off the early pace, chased three to four wide around
the final turn then retreated.

Footnotes
ACCELERITAS vied for the lead with HIGGAM around the turn, shook free in upper stretch then came under attack from SPUMONI FLOAT, dug in gamely
under pressure and held firm. SPUMONI FLOAT tracked the top pair around the turn then roused forward mid-stretch, dueled outside of the winner and
failed to get by. KOBE'S CAUSE was off slow at the start and raced in the back, angled out and circled up closer late on the turn, rallied along the outside
and closed gamely on the top pair. DARK BARON raced near midpack and saved ground around the turn, sustained a two wide bid in upper stretch then
flattened in the final furlong. QUARTERNIGHT was ridden along off the early pace, swung four to five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. HIGGAM dueled
with the eventual winner around the turn and into upper stretch then came up empty. DOING DAYS faded around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.
DARK WHISKEY showed brief response in opening stages then retreated.

Footnotes
HAILEY'S MELODY sped to the lead at the start, set the pace and continued with a slim lead around the final turn, roused two wide into upper stretch, had
plenty left in reserve and pulled away. CLAY'S MOON STONE was allowed to settle and rated in good position through early stages, edged up closer
entering the far turn then launched a bid approaching the quarter pole and failed to be a late match for pulling away winner. ALL GOOD TIMES tracked
between foes midway up the backstretch, chased along the rail on the final turn, cut the corner entering the lane and kept on for a share. CALL KRYSTAL
stalked the pace through the backstretch, raced up close two wide at the quarter pole then weakened in the lane. BLESSED AGAIN was forwardly placed
through the backstretch, flattened around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive. SPANX LEGACY was not far back along the inside, came up empty
entering the far turn and steadily retreated.

overtaken by the winner. LUCKYHOTSTUFF chased up close three wide around the turn, sustained outside bid through the lane and cleared the rest.
