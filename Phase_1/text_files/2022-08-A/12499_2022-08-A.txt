Footnotes
SILVER MOON ROAD set the pace on a clear lead through the turn while in the three path, continued off the inside into the turn while moving into the four
path, was under a minimal challenge when straightening into the lane then was ridden out to the end. MASAI MAN tracked the pace from the two path
through the turn and into the lane, bid to get closest to the winner while straightening, could get no closer through the lane and finished well clear for the
place spot. KREWE CHIEF was in the two or three path through the turn while trailing the small field, swung into the lane from the six path and passed a
tired rival for the show spot. ZELIG chased the pace from the three path through the turn, was asked for more into the lane and was empty after
straightening in the lane. RACE WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
BARBIE JEAN vied for the lead three wide through the turn, cleared into the lane, remained clear with an eighth to go and was all out to just last. C F V TU
BRUTUS vied for the lead from between rivals through mid-turn, took back to chase into the lane, shifted from the three to the five path inside the sixteenth
pole and was closing in to the wire and leading a stride past. TIME TO CONFESS vied for the lead from the inside of two others and in the two path,
continued to duel with the winner into the lane then could not keep up while lasting for the show spot. EVIE JEAN raced in the four path through the turn
while never far back, came into the lane from the five path and finished evenly. LIZ SAYS LIZARD chased the pace along the inside through the turn and
into the lane and finished tired. DON'T BE TURPRIZED was never a factor while in the two or three path through the turn. READY FOR IMPACT was outrun
from off the inside. LADY STARLIGHT raced in mid-pack through the turn and while in the four path and was empty through the lane.

Footnotes
ANGEL OF EMPIRE was unhurried while racing in the two path, moved closer through the turn while passing a rival, stayed close to the inside into the lane,
caught the leader while straightening and drove past. ACCIDENTAL HERO settled early while off the rail, bid three wide through the turn, was a serious
threat with an eighth to go then gained the place late while getting in a bit late. OVERLY D'ORO pressed the pace early while in the two or three path,
gained the lead approaching the far turn, continued with a short lead into the lane, straightened in the three path, dueled with the winner outside the eighth
pole then could not keep up and lost the place spot late. RISKY CHOICE stepped in at the start, raced in the three path into the turn, bid three wide into the
lane when a serious contender then weakened inside the eighth pole. PAYNTER'S CANVAS was never a factor while saving ground. PLAIN OR PEANUT
set the pace along the inside and was empty turning into the lane. PRINCE OF ROSES was in the three or four path through the turns and never factored.

Footnotes
ROUNDER was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the three to the four path on the turn, swung into the lane from the six path with momentum,
continued with good energy while in the six path and drove clear. JIM AND JIM chased the pace from the three path through mid-turn, was asked for more
approaching the five-sixteenths pole, gained the lead after straightening in the lane, dueled with the winner inside the eighth pole and could not keep up
while clearly second best. BIG PAPER chased the pace from the two path, bid along the inside into the lane, was a serious threat while splashing along the
rail then weakened inside the eighth pole. OUTBOUND chased the lead along the inside down the backstretch, was shuffled a bit while others made their
bids, continued on while off the rail into the lane and never was a serious threat. MR LIBERTY set the pace on a clear lead through mid-turn then gave way.
ASHWINS ORB was in the two path through the turns, asked for more in late turn and tired through the lane. GJALLARHORN never a factor while in the
three or four path through the turns. SUPER LIAISON trailed throughout while along the inside.

E'S MAGIC vied for the lead from the two path through the turn, lost the lead into the lane, came again through the final eighth and edged up. RILEYS
REDEMPTION settled off the early lead, moved quickly to bid from the four path through the turn, dueled with the winner through the final eighth, yielded
late and settled for second best. UNBRIDLED TALENT was in the three path through the turn when in mid-pack, moved to get closest to the top two after
straightening in the lane and could not gain while finishing best of the rest. FAIR FOLLY was near the rail through the turn and into the lane and never was a
serious menace`. AMERICANA ANNA was in the four or five path through the turn and into the lane and was gaining momentum late from the four path.
CHIMES raced in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five or six path and never factored. BRODY MO never a factor while in the
three path through the turn. B FLAT OUT was hard ridden early to vie for the lead, chased the pace into the lane and was empty. ALWAYS BLOSSOM vied
for the lead three wide through mid-turn, getting out in late turn then bolted to mid-track and was not persevered with.

Footnotes
RICH KINGDOM lead the way around the first turn then dueled from the inside on the backstretch, gained command at the three eights pole then drew clear
in the stretch proving best. BENNY'S LEGACY chased the pace from the inside, was in a steady drive to rally in upper stretch but it was not enough to catch
the leader. BAKER'S MAN chased the dueling leaders while four wide, was gaining ground on the far turn to rally in the stretch but came up evenly in the
end. LOADEMUPJUSTICE raced in the middle of the field from the inside then came out five wide on the turn to bid in the stretch but was no threat. SILENT
SONATA broke in at the start then was forwardly placed going into the first turn, then dueled for the lead from the two path, was in a hard drive to rally on
the far turn then weakened in late stretch. CONCRETE CHARLIE chased the pace while two wide, was gaining ground steadily to bid on the second turn
then flattened out in the final furlongs. INDOCUMENTADO trailed throughout and was no factor.

Footnotes
FAIRE EXPRESS chased the two rival duel through the turn while in the three path, asked for more in late turn, swept past the duelers into the lane, cleared
while straightening in the lane and was never menaced through the stretch run. EULALIA was void of early speed while racing in the three path through the
turn, came into the lane from the four path, angled in to avoid traffic nearing the eighth pole then rallied from the two path for the place spot. LANTANA
JUSTICE saved ground through the turn, came into the lane from the two or three path then was out-dueled for the place spot while finishing with good
energy. RHAPSODY IN GREY pressed then vied for the lead two wide through mid-turn, was passed by the winner into the lane, was no match for that one
while chasing her home then weakened late and lost positions. MYGALJUSTICE was never a menace while in the three or four path through the turn.
BEYOND JUSTICE raced in the two path through the turn when in mid-pack then tired in the late running. OOMPH GIRL in the two path through the turn
when well back, angled into the seven path for the drive and moved up while never a serious menace. SANTIVA DIVA vied for the lead along the inside
through the turn and was empty through the final eighth. CHOCOLATE TRUTH outrun while along the inside. ELLIE'S DISPUTE was in the four path
through the turn when in mid-pack and was done entering the lane.
