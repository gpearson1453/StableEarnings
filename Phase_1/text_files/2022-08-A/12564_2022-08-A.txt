ROUGH RIDE sprinted clear at once, saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. CAPTAIN DASHI chased the winner while racing
two-wide, could not reach that one but was clearly second best. INQUISITION was forwardly place while saving ground and finished in a mild rally. FLOYD
KNOWLES was never far back while racing four-wide but lacked the needed late response. HIGH SPEED CHASE was prominent early while racing
three-wide, was in tight briefly nearing the three-eighths pole and then gave way when clear.

STEPHEN JAMES saved ground setting the pace while racing in hand, responded when asked and increased his advantage in the stretch while drifting out
slightly. POPPY'S C NOTE was forwardly placed from the start while racing three-wide, could not reach the winner but continued on well for the place in a
good effort. PROUD LION prominent early while racing two-wide, dropped back on the turn, then came again late between horses to earn the show.
EROTIC broke in the air then moved up four-wide to be within in striking range to the stretch and weakened late. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT saved ground while
being allowed to settle in stride but lacked rally.

MISO FAST was unhurried early, moved closer to the leader on turn along the inside, found room entering the stretch, caught Zatter nearing the eighth pole
and gradually drew clear late. ZATTER saved ground setting the pressured pace, drifted out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole, responded when
challenged and held on gamely during the drive. JERSEY RED stalked the pace while racing three-wide on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch and
finished willingly. UNION BLISS dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. MARQUE IT UP vied with Zatter for the
lead from along the outside for a half mile and weakened.

Footnotes
BERNALINHO prompted the pace set by Wine At Nine from along the outside, caught that one at the eighth pole and proved best under strong handling.
WINE AT NINE saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged and held on determinedly while unable to resist the winner. MASTER
RECOVERY saved ground while being unhurried, found room entering the stretch and was making up ground late. ALPINE HYPNOSIS saved ground while
being allowed to settle in stride, came three-wide into the stretch and finished willingly. BLAME IT ON KITTY dropped back early, came two-wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. MILORDS OATHKEEPER was forwardly placed for five furlongs while racing three-wide and gave way.

Footnotes
MISCHIEF ROAD was bumped at the start when Coastal King came in, then was allowed to settle in stride while saving ground, slipped through during the
drive, caught Stylish Elegance nearing the eighth pole and quickly drew clear to win with something left. STYLISH ELEGANCE dueled for the lead from
along the inside, drifted out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole, was no match for the winner but held on well for the place. ROWDY RETURNS was
pinched back at the start then saved ground while being unhurried, found room entering the stretch, angled out for room nearing the sixteenth pole and
finished fast. SYZSLAK was bumped at the start by Coastal King, then was prominently placed to the stretch while racing three-wide and weakened.
COASTAL KING broke in sharply to bump Syzslak, then was allowed to settle in stride, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TOO TALL TO
CALL vied for the early lead from along the outside, was four-wide entering the stretch and tired. MAN IN BLACK gave way after showing brief speed while
racing four-wide.

RED NOVA dueled for the early lead from along the inside, drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths and continued to drift out slightly during the drive and just
lasted under pressure. MEAN SHARON stumbled badly at the start, then moved up along the inside to reach contention before going a quarter mile, slipped
through entering the stretch and finished strongly to just miss. COLLECTING STARS stalked the pace racing in hand, moved up three-wide nearing the
quarter pole, was carried out slightly by the winner while off her bid, but wasn't quite good enough. BLOWING BAYOU prompted the pace to the stretch
from along the outside and weakened. TEASPOON OF PEPPER dropped back early and failed to threaten.
