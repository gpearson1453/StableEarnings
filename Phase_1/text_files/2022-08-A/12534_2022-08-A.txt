Footnotes
CROSSED UP good position off rail to far turn, clear path, dueled to the wire all out and prevailed under stout handling. LINE DANCER just off leaders to
the stretch, stuck her head in front late, stayed game to the wire but lost the nod. JUST ZOEY speed to the front, stayed to quarter pole but weakened in the
drive. SORORITY SISTER good position inside throughout, failed to respond in the drive. BIRDIE'S CHANTZ had an awkward start, steadied along to the
half, angled out with no response when clear. CONCORDSDIFFERENCE between horses first turn chasing leader, gave way readily.
