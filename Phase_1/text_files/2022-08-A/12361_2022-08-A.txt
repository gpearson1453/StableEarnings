PRIVATE LAKE quickly cleared the lead and opened up by a wide margin around the first turn, continued well clear over rivals around the far turn, coaxed
two wide into the drive, found more in reserve and finished clear. SEE THE PYRAMIDS rated off the clear leader through early stages, saved ground around
the far turn, given cue along the rail at the head of the lane, closed the gap on the winner a furlong out and finished second best. WILLTOBELUCKY tracked
the clear leader through the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn and ran on for a share. PINSON was off a step slow at the start, raced in the
back and failed to rally.

Footnotes
FREDDY J set a pressured pace through the backstretch, continued with a slim advantage going by the quarter pole, coaxed two wide into the drive, dug in
gamely, turned back the bid from EVIL KNIEVAL and held firm. EVIL KNIEVEL raced three wide around the first turn then stalked the pace to the far turn,
launched a bid for FREDDY J approaching the quarter pole, sustained a bid in close range through the lane but failed to get by the winner. FLEET OF
HOOF rated need midpack in early backstretch, made a three wide move late on the far turn, hustled along four wide into the lane, sustained response and
cleared the rest. ONE LAST CHANT was off a step slow at the start and settled off the early pace, urged inside around the far turn then faded through the
lane. NATIVE HELLRAISER raced inside in range going by the half mile marker then came up empty mid-way around the far turn. BLUEGRASS FLIGHT
raced three to four wide around the first turn, raced off the pace and steadily retreated. WE'RE ALL NUTS prompted the pace around the first turn and
through the backstretch then emptied out.

LURCH was away in good order and advanced to challenge COLORFUL NATIIVE for the lead, dueled around the turn then shook free turning for home and
pulled away. STROLL LIKN OUTLAW hustled up out of the gate and gained close contention, chased the top pair three wide around the turn, sustained bid
through the lane and finished second best. BOTTOMLESS raced off the early pace, roused along the rail entering the lane and prevailed for a share. SOLE
SURVIVOR bobbled slightly at the start and tracked in contention around the turn, ran on four wide into the lane and got edged for show. COLORFUL
NATIVE raced four wide near midpack midway around the turn, ran on into the lane but needed more for impact. FRANKLY EPIC led the way in opening
stages then took on the challenge from LURCH, dueled inside of rival around the turn then gave way. MILTON STREET chased the pace two wide around
the turn and lacked a needed rally. FLAT SPOOKY raced three wide around the turn and never threatened. SAW THE SUNRISE raced three to four wide

YOU TALKIN TO ME tracked near the inside through the backstretch then raced two to three wide around the turn, given cue at the head of the lane,
cleared command near mid-stretch and finished going away. TIN BADGE dueled with SHUT UP MAN through the backstretch, shook free entering the far
turn, got overtaken by the winner past the furlong marker but stayed on and cleared second best. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND was reserved racing in the back,
picked up the tempo three wide around the far turn and got up in closing strides to take show. GREEDY CREEDY stalked the pace through the backstretch,
chased three wide around the far turn then weakened and got nipped for show. JOHN R settled off the early pace then coaxed four wide late on the far turn
and had no response. SHUT UP MAN dueled inside of TIN BADGE through the backstretch then weakened around the far turn and continued to tire in the
drive. GO ADMIRAL GO was keen and tugged four wide around the first turn then settled just off mid-range in early backstretch, came up empty entering
the far turn and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
JUSTA STREAK dueled for the lead with PRIDEOFDIXIE through the backstretch then shook free with three furlongs left to run, held firm around the turn
then roused three wide at the head of the lane, had plenty left in reserve and finished going away. OSCAR WINNER WALLY raced just off midpack entering
the turn, chased two wide then angled inside and dug in late to capture place. PRIDEOFDIXIECREED broke out at the start and hustled up to challenge
JUSTA STREAK for the early lead, could not match strides around the turn but remained in close contention, ran on into the lane and got nipped for place.
STORMIN' J. J. raced outside off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane and improved position without threatening. SAY IT NICELY raced in the
second flight leaving the backstretch, continued in contention three to four wide around the turn then gave way. ALL OVER OLIVER raced just off the top
pair in early stages, remained forwardly placed three wide around the turn then faded approaching the furlong marker. WAR RON raced off the pace, was
ridden three to four wide around the turn and failed to rally. AMERICAN POSSE saved ground throughout and never threatened.
