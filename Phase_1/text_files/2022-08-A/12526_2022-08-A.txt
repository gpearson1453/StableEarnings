just missed third. DIMITRI'S ROMANCE chased, rounded the turn about the three path, eased to the outside entering the stretch and ran evenly in the lane.

Footnotes
PULL UP MY SOCKS saved ground racing well off the early pace, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved at the rail on the far
turn, dug in through the final furlong to take over in late yards and raced clear under the wire. DUKE OF CORK broke in to make contact with Cayatano then
veered sharply outward, took the lead at the thirteen sixteenths pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the quarter
pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and was caught flattening stride the final yards. YDOUHAVETOBESOMEAN rated close inside, picked up the chase
from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened inside the eighth pole. CHASE LIL ME broke out to make contact with Cayatano
then settled back off the rail, bid into the backstretch, ran near the rail on the far turn, eased to the five path into the lane and showed little further. GHOST
MINE was bumped early then saved ground on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn in the four and five paths and showed little in the lane. CRISTIANO BOY stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn. KID GENIUS was forced outward and into Ghost Mine shortly after the start then settled off the rail, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path of the far turn. DON'TCALLTOOEARLY rounded the opening turn about the four path
and showed little response through the backstretch. CAYATANO was jostled at the start, stalked off the rail the first turn then faded past the three eighths
pole.
