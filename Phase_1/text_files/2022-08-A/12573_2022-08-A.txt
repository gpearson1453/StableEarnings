Footnotes
BIGMANCAN , under urging soon after the break, gained a two wide lead leaving the turn, opened up in mid stretch and was kept under pressure in the
drive. SUBJECT TO CHANGE , nicely rated along the inner rail while stalking the pace for three furlongs, eased out to the two path leaving the turn and
rallied. EXCALIBUR , a forward factor in the two path between horses around the turn, was fanned three wide in upper stretch and finished willingly. ROYAL
THUNDER sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail, was overtaken approaching the stretch and faded. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU , three wide on the
turn, was floated to the four path in upper stretch and weakened. AIR ON FIRE , four deep on the turn, faltered.

Footnotes
PLEASE MARRY ME cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, was joined by PRINCESS PALMER past the five eighths, sparred with that one into the
turn then saw that one go clear, stayed in touch under a light hold then eased out approaching the stretch, came back under right handed asking to draw
alongside leaving the sixteenth marker, wrested command late and drew clear. PRINCESS PALMER , taken to rate, eased out for the backstretch run,
edged up to join PLEASE MARRY ME nearing the half mile marker, poked a head in front leaving the far turn then was let out a bit to clear, kept on under a
drive past mid stretch, dug in when confronted then ceded grudgingly in the final yards. LITTLE NUTTER , four wide and outside rivals early on, dropped in
some and took closer order past the five sixteenths, gave hard chase from there and churned on willingly to the line. SULLIVAN STREET , three wide and
between rivals heading to the half mile pole, came in slightly forcing BLOCK PARTY in which in turn tightened MULSANNE (IRE), straightened to chase off
the inside, shifted four wide into the stretch and continued grinding to the wire. BLOCK PARTY settled towards the inside, raced two wide and between
runners heading to the half mile marker, bumped with MULSANNE (IRE) when forced in soon after, regrouped and saved ground into the lane, eased out a
bit but lacked the needed finish. MULSANNE (IRE) , in a bit tight at the break, was making a steady run along the rail nearing the half mile pole but had to
check when bumped and put in close quarters, dropped back several lengths and failed to make a recovery. TOUSSAUD'S RANSOM , four wide early,
dropped off the pace, shifted in then shied from the rail near the quarter pole. EXCUSEMEMISSMARGOT was outrun. Following an objection by the rider of
MULSANNE (IRE), SULLIVAN STREET was disqualified from fourth and placed sixth for causing interference near the half mile marker. An objection by the
rider of MULSANNE (IRE) against LITTLE NUTTER was not allowed.

DRIVE BY LAYOVER , three deep around the turn, drifted in a bit and brushed with JOHNNY SWISH in upper stretch, took the lead late and drove clear.
PIT STOP MAN sped to the early lead, saved ground around the turn, raced in the two path in the stretch, lost the lead late but willingly held the place. HAIR
OF THE DOG hugged the inner rail throughout, finished gamely but was caught in narrow quarters the final furlong. JOHNNY SWISH , a forward factor in
the two path between horses around the turn, brushed with the winner when drifting out a bit in upper stretch and lacked the needed late effort.
REMEMBERING WILBUR lacked speed and was outrun.

Footnotes
PAPAL LAW settled in the clear while not far back, moved up under some coaxing past the five sixteenths, shifted out four wide soon into the lane, rallied
under right handed asking and took command outside an embattled pair with an eighth to go, spurted clear then held firm while kept to task. ONE TWO KID
, unhurried early while off the inside commenced a four wide run between rivals leaving the half mile marker, angled out a bit wider when advancing into the
lane and kept on willingly to gain the place. PRETTY GOOD YEAR settled in mid pack while towards the inside, crept closer near the five sixteenths, cut the
corner with run into the lane, eased out to move up behind rivals then churned on with interest through the final seventy yards. UP AGAINST IT was nudged
up early and stalked off the rail, moved up and bit two wide outside BOAT'S A ROCKIN with a quarter mile to go, dueled and got on near even terms in mid
stretch, kept on willingly past the sixteenth pole then faded late. BOAT'S A ROCKIN cleared early and dropped right down to the rail, set a moderate pace
under rating, braced for a bid nearing the quarter pole, dueled to mid stretch then weakened late. SUPER E , off the pace, was under a ride four wide past
the three eighths, angled six wide around rivals into the stretch but failed to seriously sustain. IRISH RIVIERA lagged back, came four wide for the drive and
failed to menace. BELTWAY BOB was taken five wide for the backstretch run, moved up some into the far turn but lacked any further punch. TOE CURLIN'
KISS , three wide, moved up some while between foes past the three eighths but failed to sustain. GOLDENLINEOF saved ground giving some early chase
and faltered.

Footnotes
STAY OUT broke alertly to make the early lead, set the pace in the two path around the track and was kept to her business in the drive. SICK PACK SARA ,
reluctant to load into the starting gate, saved ground around the turn and gamely chased the winner throughout. HUFFLEPUFF bumped with DAT DARES
GOLD soon after the break, stalked the pace two wide on the turn, moved to the inner rail turning for home and offered a slight rally inside horses. R TRUE
SENSATION , a forward factor in the three path between horses around the turn, lacked the needed rally. DAT DARES GOLD jostled between horses soon
after the break, circled the turn four deep and gave way. MRS. CREWS bumped DAT DARES GOLD when bearing in soon after the break then was not a
factor. ELOQUENT LADY , outrun, drifted wide entering the stretch.

Footnotes
NATHAN DETROIT , under firm rating while saving ground into the backstretch, remained on hold as a pace battle developed through the backstretch,
came under pressure leaving the three eighths then proceeded to advance along the rail into the stretch, swung out for a clear run leaving the three
sixteenths, closed sharply under pressure, caught CANNON'S ROAR inside the sixteenth marker then edged away late. CANNON'S ROAR , well placed
while saving ground and in range of a pace scrum, was put to a ride leaving the five sixteenths then shifted four wide with momentum into the lane, rolled up
under asking and took over from SO STREET inside the furlong grounds, failed to contain the winner through the final seventy yards but continued with
good effort to the wire. SO STREET , keen to to go early, cleared off then secured the rail past the three quarter pole, was joined from his outside by
SUMMER TO REMEMBER soon into the backstretch, sparred with that one into around the final turn, shook clear under a drive near the three sixteenths,
failed to hold off CANNON'S ROAR past the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly. NICK PAPAGIORGIO settled outside the winner, angled six wide under
a ride into the lane, straightened and rallied mildly. SCARLETT SKY settled in the clear, was put to pressure leaving the far turn, shifted out five wide into
the lane, got in a bit nearing mid stretch, corrected, had some late action between rivals then kept on through the gallop out. SUMMER TO REMEMBER
moved up to the outside of SO STREET nearing the five eighths, vied with that one to about the quarter pole, failed to kick on in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
HE HATE ME saved ground around the turn while stalking the duel, eased out to the three path in upper stretch, swept to command outside the duelers
near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. ALGEBRAIC disputed the pace outside YES SIR ROBERT, put that one away inside the eighth pole and faded late.
YES SIR ROBERT bobbled slightly a few strides after the break, hugged the inner rail while disputing the pace and weakened the final sixteenth of a mile.
ASKIN FOR A BASKIN , in the two path stalking the pace around the turn, floated four wide in upper stretch and weakened. ROYAL CRUSADER bobbled at
the break, raced well off the rail into the stretch and failed to be a factor. MERU , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, faltered through the stretch.

Footnotes
EVANGELINE ALLONS settled in mid pack while off the inside, came under a hearty ride while in the clear leaving the far turn, gathered some momentum
into the lane, altered out past the three sixteenths, straightened and closed in under pressure, snagged command with about a sixteenth to go, briefly went
clear then was all out to hold off TORRE BRANCA. TORRE BRANCA was urged from the gate, steadied briefly when in tight towards the rail into the first
turn, raced well back nearing the far turn, was put to firm asking past the three eighths, angled four to five wide approaching the stretch, drifted in some
before correcting then closed gamely outside the winner. BLAME THE IRISH settled in range while off the rail, angled out leaving the far turn and made
progress three wide, was floated out nearing the furlong grounds, regrouped and churned on. IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN tracked outside, moved in hand to
engage to the leader nearing the quarter pole, responded when asked and kicked clear soon into the lane, wandered outward from left handed asking
nearing the eighth pole, failed to contain challenges and weakened late. HELLUVA LADY saved ground, edged up nearing the far turn, was put to a ride to
remain in range past the five sixteenths, eased out into the stretch, dropped back in with pursuit leaving the eighth pole but came up empty.
CLOSERTOTHEHEART sprinted clear then was keyed up quite a bit and fought restraint around the first turn and into the backstretch, settled better past
the five eighths, met a challenge near the quarter pole, ceded the lead soon after, stayed on willingly to mid stretch then weakened. PEARLY GHOST ,
fractious in the gate, steadied early, dropped well back and never generated a serious kick. HOLDING COURT was checked off heels in the opening
furlong, recovered to race in the clear leaving the five eighths, failed to kick on into the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
EASTERN BAY lacked speed, hugged the inner rail on the turn, eased out to the four path leaving the turn, closed determinedly outside horses, led late and
drove clear. KARAN'S NOTION , a forward factor in the two path down the backstretch, moved to the inner rail leaving the turn, dueled inside KADRI and
faded late. KADRI showed speed in the three path down the backstretch, disputed the pace outside KARAN'S NOTION and finished willingly. YOUNGEST
OF FIVE showed speed along the inner rail, swung out leaving the turn and weakened. YODEL E. A. WHO , outrun, raced along the inner rail around the
turn, in the stretch and angled out late. ALWAYSINAHURRY stalked the early pace in the three pace and faltered on the turn.

Footnotes
MISSAWLET , a bit fractious in the gate, lunged at the break to be away last, recovered and edged up three wide around the first turn then settled off of a
duel, responded when given her cue and made progress four wide nearing the lane, took over outside the embattled leaders in upper stretch, briefly went
clear in mid stretch then was fully extended to hold off AMARETTO SOUR to her inside. AMARETTO SOUR rated off the pace while saving ground, eased
out leaving the far turn then moved up between foes to bid soon into the lane, shifted in and snuck through to engage the winner from her inside past furlong
grounds and fought valiantly to the end. SINGALONG broke a bit awkwardly, was unhurried early while trailing and saving some ground, came under
pressure around the final turn, shifted out well wide for the final furlong and finished with interest. WAY LUCKY , settled off the pace and outside a rival early
on, made a wide run nearing the lane, altered out to avoid a rider less horse then came up empty in the final furlong. LOTTACLASS LILSASS , off the pace
while saving ground, eased out into the stretch, was caught in a bit of traffic between foes in mid stretch then failed to kick on. HEARTBURN took over
between runners early the secured the inside, was joined from her outside around the first turn, dueled to the quarter pole while holding a slim lead, ceded
command three sixteenths out then weakened. PERFECT MOVE , keen to go three wide into the first turn, dropped in a bit and engaged HEARTBURN, got
into a tussle with that one from the three quarter pole, drifted out a bit and appeared to have her heels clipped approaching the lane, stayed on a little more
then succumbed. HOV LANE , well placed inside, failed to kick on nearing the quarter pole and faded. PENSIVELY , two to three wide in closest pursuit of
the duel past the five eighths, advanced three wide nearing the five sixteenths then appeared to clip the heels of PERFECT MOVE near the quarter pole
and lost her rider. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning PENSIVELY but no action was taken.
