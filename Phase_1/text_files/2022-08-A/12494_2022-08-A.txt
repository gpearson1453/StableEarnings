for show spot. VIEWERS DISCRETION never far back outside to the stretch, leveled off in late going. KLIMT'S MUSE never reached a contending position.
CYNOSURE saved ground while faded back in the stretch run. TONES never threatened. GOLD SPINNER pressed pace to far turn, gave way readily.

Footnotes
GALILETA awkward start, rushed, chased to turn, led stretch, held sway to the wire. ARCELOR saved ground to turn, swarmed past the quarter pole,
re-rallied in the stretch for place spot. MOMOS HUMOR had an awkward start, raced evenly to the stretch with a mild gain for show. QUIET DAWN outside
trip to turn, rallied widest to improved position in the stretch run late. UNUNDERSTANDABLE raced evenly with no late kick in the drive. TOP HAT
INVASION awkward start, no speed to stretch, no real threat in the drive. GUILDER inside speed to the front, gave way from the turn and stretch.
