LOYALTY SPIRIT brushed at the break would rally into the far turn vying from the four path down the stretch surging late to get up between horses. HOLY
SAINT prompted the pace from the outset dueling abreast rival through the far turn into upper stretch being joined from the outside late not backing down
battling to the end. MR. MAGICO brushed at the break split horses entering the far turn angling out into upper stretch bidding widest at mid track to be right
there at the end. BROTHER SKYE away alertly set a pressured pace dueling inside of rival through the far turn extending late under additional pressure
fighting on from the rail late. DYNAFORM a step slow through the far turn was no factor. TEN TWENTY NINE tracked evenly to the far turn wavering there
fading into upper stretch. KOLSCH hustled early gave way on the backside.

HOLIDAY BONUS set clear set the pace on early favorable fractions holding off rivals on the far turn saving ground to widen a bit in upper stretch holding
clear to wire. AMBASSADOR JIM gave a mild middle move then rallied to threaten on the far turn, angling out a bit to the three path in mid stretch couldn't
get to the winner late. ERIC THE SALESMAN tracked the pace while saving ground chasing into upper stretch angling off the rail to the two path late
needing more in the closing yards. RED CAT (CHI) stalked the pace chasing to the far turn wavering a bit there in pursuit racing four wide down the lane
giving an even finish. RUM ON THE ROCKS raced second flight failing to mount a credible bid. GOTSOMEMOJO slow early was never involved.
