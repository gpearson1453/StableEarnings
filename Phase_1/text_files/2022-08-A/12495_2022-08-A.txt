Footnotes
MO CLARE'S broke sharply, showed the way while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to lead around the far turn and
held that margin under mild urging to the wire. UNRULY JULIE saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run
up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the four path and gained ground late in the stretch. FIONNBHARR saved ground around the first turn, trailed
the field up the backstretch, began to improve position from the rail around the second bend, switched to the outside in upper stretch and gained ground
late. AURUM saved ground around the first turn, chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and flattened
out in the final furlong. INSIDE THE BOX stalked the leader from the two path through the opening half mile, raced between horses in the three path around
the far turn and faded in the lane. SENECA ROCKS raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back
coming around the far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EL GUAPO stalked three wide, made bid while three wide coming into the stretch, and drew clear. TACTICAL CHEECH raced in midpack from the three
path, was ridden along in six path at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. MAILMAN'S A FLYER rated from the four path, was driven from the three path
into the stretch, and improved late to show. CURLIN'S MALIBU rated inside, was hustled while tipping out to the four path coming into the stretch, but
flattened. GET THEM DIGITS led inside, was asked midway around the turn, but faded into the stretch. BLACK CURRENCY pressed two wide, was roused
two wide at the top of the lane, but was tired. JAQUE MATE COCO trailed from the two path and never threatened.

Footnotes
CATNIP prompted the pace from three wide, bid two wide at the top of the lane, and drew past late. SIEGE OF BOSTON led from inside, was cued when
headed top lane, stayed on but yielded late to place. HARD TRAVELER hopped at the start, was keen in midpack and two wide, was in the three path
coming into the stretch, but finished evenly to show. FLEETING ATTE trailed from inside, was hustled two wide into the stretch, but was one paced.
ELUSIVE tracked between rivals, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, but flattened. BOLD LICORICE raced well back in the three path, was
driven four wide into the stretch, but was empty. SPIRITUAL GHOST rated in the three path, was hustled three wide into the stretch, but was no menace.
BORRELLY pressed two wide early but dropped out rounding the far turn.

Footnotes
SIMPLY SUPER chased the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the three path passing the three eighths pole,
dueled gamely in the final furlong and wore down his rival late. HELDISH led the way from the two path up the short backstretch and around the turn,
continued to show the way entering the stretch and dueled gamely to the wire, giving way grudgingly in the final strides. GRAND ESCAPE stalked the pace
setter on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly, no match for the top two. MY MAMBA raced in the middle of the
pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path and gained ground mildly on the outside in late stretch.
COFFEEWITHCHRIS tracked the leader on the outside in the opening stages, raced in the three and four path around the turn, swung wide entering the
stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. BANDITS HEART raced off the pace in the two path up the backstretch and around the turn and made no bid
while drifting out in the stretch. GABRIEL'S WING raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and faded in the lane.
GENERAL J R trailed the field the entire way around the oval and, despite saving ground, was never a factor.

TITOSCHANGEDMYLUCK raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the three path, gained ground between
horses in upper stretch, and pulled clear while drifting in late. REBEL CONSORT brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to chase
the leader from the two path up the short backstretch and around the turn, raced into traffic in the final furlong, switched to the outside to find room and
finished willingly. LIVANA was bumped by the horse to her inside at the break, settled off the pace on the inside in the early going, switched out to the four
path to began a bid coming off the turn, swung wider still entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside in the lane. COCKTAIL DREAMING broke
sharply and angled over headed into the turn, stalked the leader while saving ground ground through the next quarter of a mile, moved up to challenge in
upper stretch, raced into traffic and was forced to steady slightly near the sixteenth pole and was outkicked from there. GENIEINABRIDLE bumped with the
horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and was empty late. BEE MOUNTAIN
brushed with the horse to her outside at the break, recovered to lead the field while saving ground around the turn and faded in the stretch. NAVAL EMPIRE
hopped up leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside in the opening stages, came around the turn in the four path and made no bid. BACK SEAT
BETTY hopped up leaving the gate, raced up on the inside headed into the turn, ran into traffic and was forced to take up sharply, dropped back to trail the
field from the two and three path from there and was no factor while drifting out in the lane.

STRONG HEADED stalked in the two path, bid two wide at the top of the lane, and edged away late. CLINT MAROON (GB) led under a firm hold, was cued
from inside at the top of the stretch, but yielded grudgingly. THE QUEENS JULES tracked inside, was hustled while saving ground around the far turn,
shifted three wide at the top of the stretch, and ran on. UNCLE ARMANDO chased two wide, was cued inside at the top of the lane, and kept on.
COLONIST was behind and three wide, moved up into the far turn, was four wide going into stretch, but flattened, FERMAT rated from inside but was never
a threat. MEDICINE TAIL raced in midpack while three wide, was coaxed three wide into the stretch, but weakened. LOKOYA ROAD raced from well back
in the three path but was done early.

SMILE BRYAN raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leader well off the pace up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the far turn,

the win. CAPTAIN THUNDER raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to improve position while racing in the
four path around the far turn, dueled gamely down the lane, bumping with SMILE BRYAN in late stretch, and just missed. SPEED GAME raced in the two
path around the far turn, settled off the pace to chase the frontrunner on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and kept on in the
lane. MAKES MO CENTS saved ground at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, raced in the three path around the turn and gained ground on
the outside late. PACKED HOUSE led the way from the two path around the first turn, opened up on the field while racing inside up the backstretch and
around the far turn, was caught with a furlong to go and tired from there. CLEAR N CONVINCING trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and
up the backstretch, switched out to the six path coming around the turn, swung wider still entering the stretch and was empty from there. CITY PLAN raced
in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and made
no bid. BIG ONE saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, raced inside around the far turn

FEISTY KITTEN chased inside, loomed up five wide passing the three sixteenths, and rallied. JUSTIN'S QUEST pressed two wide, was hustled three wide
into the stretch, and stayed on. TIJUANA BRASS raced in midpack while two wide, swung three wide into the stretch, and ran on to show. STRAIGHT UP
GUY was unhurried from inside, was ridden in the two path coming into the stretch, tipped five wide in upper stretch, and improved. POINT OF GRACE
tracked inside,was coaxed four wide at the top of the stretch, but finished evenly. TITRATE stalked inside, cut the corner into the stretch, but flattened.
POWER THROUGH set the pace from the rail, was hustled inside coming into the stretch, but gave way. VINTNER trailed early from the two path and
passed tiring horses late. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS was well back in the three path but never threatened. AUTHORITARIAN was in midfield while three
wide but weakened into the stretch. YOWZA YOWZA YOWZA rated while two wide but was done early.
