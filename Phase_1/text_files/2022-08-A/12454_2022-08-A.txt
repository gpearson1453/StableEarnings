Footnotes
BATTLE OF NORMANDY three wide through the first turn, raced three wide in pursuit coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down continuing
three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge knocking heads before taking command a sixteenth out, then edged away to the finish kept to task.
ALEXIS ZORBA (GB) established the front just after the start and showed the way three then two wide through the first turn under a rating hold before
taking to the inside into the backstretch, had MULLINGAR latch on outside and was given a notch to shake that rival off five and a half furlongs from home
taking to the two path briefly before tucking back inside with seven-sixteenths to go, remained patiently handled through the turn and took the inside route
into upper stretch, got roused straightened away, dug in under threat dueling from the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker when headed for the front, then
ran on safe for the place honors. MOONFLYER broke inwards hitting the near side stall at the start and then brushing with RED ROUTE ONE before being
taken hold of as BATTLE OF NORMANDY tucked in front and conceded three to four lengths to the front, chased just off the inside through the first turn
before going three wide down the backstretch and into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and tucked to the two path with five-sixteenths
to run, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. MULLINGAR three then two wide in closest aim of the leader,
advanced to briefly latch on the leader six furlongs from home before being shaken off with five and a half furlongs remaining, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. RED ROUTE ONE got brushed at the start by MOONFLYER,
then got taken in hand when losing the seam in front and lost about a length of ground, settled along the inside through the first turn before taking to the two
path down the backstretch, tucked back inside into the far turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and
offered no response. TRACK MATE coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside forwardly placed early on, steadily faded and came under
coaxing at the three-eighths along the inside backing away to the tail of the field, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. CARA'S PRINCE
just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing tucked inside three furlongs from home, continued along the inside route into upper stretch and
tired.

SHE CAUGHT MY EYE moved in while going to the front and took the path of MADAME ROSE early, showed the way under pressure from that foe to the
outside, moved clear along the rail with seven-sixteenths to run, was asked while challenged at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead at the quarter-pole then
turned into upper stretch under the crop, regained the advantage outside the furlong marker then kicked clear under a right-handed crop, was placed under
a strong hand-ride while drawing away outside the sixteenth-pole then put to lighter encouragement late while much the best. MOSTLY HARMLESS broke
out at the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, gained to make a bid at the five-sixteenths, took a short lead at the
quarter-pole, led under a drive until outside the furlong marker then lost the advantage back to the winner and proved no match while well clear for the
place. AFILADA broke out and bumped with a foe then was hustled, raced just off the pace between horses, chased four wide on the turn and tired while
able to get the show. TOOSWEETTOBESOUR was bumped at the start and forced out, raced between foes under urging early then dropped back, moved
in around the five-eighths pole, gained in the two path on the turn, chased just behind the leaders late on that bend, dropped back into upper stretch and
weakened. LORDHEARMYPRAYER was forced in at the start then bumped hard with a foe and dropped back, raced at the rear of the field, moved from the
three path to the rail around the turn and was no factor. TEKILA lunged at the break then came outward, was urged along just off the pace on the outside,
chased five wide around the turn and capitulated. SCHOOL OF THOUGHT was bumped hard at the start then dropped back, raced well off the pace under
urging, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. MADAME ROSE broke in and brushed with a foe, steadied when having his path taken
by the winner early then shifted out over heels, moved up to press the pace on the outside, came up empty into the turn and retreated.

four wide into the stretch, lugged in under a left-handed crop at the three-sixteenths then was corrected by the rider, rallied outside while continuing to lug in
under heavy right-rein correction, gained to make a bid coming to the sixteenth-pole and got up under good handling. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE was hustled to
the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked on the far turn, spun into upper stretch in close to the two path, responded well under a strong
hand-ride, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, fought on when challenged
by the winner into the final sixteenth and was caught while able to get the place in a good effort. EYES ON TARGET was well placed while rated just off the
pace on the inside, drafted behind horses on the far turn, came under urging outside the quarter-pole, chased inside in upper stretch, tipped out to the two
path at the furlong marker then continued in pursuit, steadied while lacking room between the top two in the final sixteenth and missed while clear for the
show. CASANOVA KITTEN brushed with a foe while breaking a touch awkwardly, went three wide around the opening bend, settled outside but with cover,
was asked leaving the backstretch, chased three wide on the far turn, brushed with a foe in upper stretch, pursued the leader under a drive into the final
furlong and weakened. DREAM WORKS (FR) was taken under a tight hold early, traveled three wide around the first turn under restraint, was reserved

Footnotes
DYNADRIVE saved ground near the rear of the field patiently handled as the top pair shook away separately from the field, tipped to the two path near the
five-sixteenths placed to light coaxing, spun three wide into upper stretch following SIFTING SANDS, had the former leader drift to the inside when headed
for command at the three-sixteenths and rallied on through the open seam in the two path to confront the leader a furlong from home taking the inside just
inside the eighth pole, dug in put in tight inside of that rival head to head and scraped the paint at the sixteenth marker without hesitation before taking
command narrowly seventy yards from home and gamely got the head on the wire to score. SIFTING SANDS (GB) tracked the pace along the inside
leading the main flight well behind a pair of spurting away rivals early on, began to take closer order inside the half mile pole and tipped to the two path
seven-sixteenths from home for the run around the far turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper stretch getting first run
on the leg weary leader, seized the front with three-sixteenths to go and dug in under threat to the inside, dueled inside the final furlong to the finish with the
aforementioned foe placing that rival in tight a sixteenth from home, got displaced narrowly from the front seventy yards from home and fought on game to
the finish but was ultimately bested at the end. DUKE OF HAZZARD (FR) got steadied at the start when placed a bit in tight, saved ground at the tail of the
field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. PUBLIC
SECTOR (GB) two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, tipped five wide into upper stretch, kept on one paced through to the
finish and made no late headway. SAFE CONDUCT coaxed from the gate, vied briefly inside for the lead before easing off to concede the front to
SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN, chased that rival in closest aim two to three wide isolated between that spurting away leader and the rest of the field well behind
her, closed in as the leader grew leg weary midway on the far turn and came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN coaxed from the gate, disputed the front briefly with safe conduct before taking over to show the
way just off the inside through the first turn, spurted away in earnest down the backstretch three then two wide, remained in hand through the far turn
growing leg weary while just off the inside as the field took closer order quickly, spun from the two path into upper stretch under threat and relented drifting
to the rail at the three-sixteenths, then weakened to the finish. SOUTH BEND chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. T D DANCE three then two wide through the first turn, chased three to four paths off the inside
down the backstretch and through the far turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

DISARM broke a bit awkwardly, moved up to be well positioned just off the pace, chased two then three wide around the turn, gained four wide into the
stretch, took the advantage just inside the three-sixteenths, shook clear inside the furlong marker, was given one pop of a left-handed crop outside the
sixteenth-pole then widened under a brisk hand-ride to the wire. ARTHUR'S RIDE drifted out leaving the chute, contested the pace between horses, vied in
three path while outside of a foe on the turn, battled with his held a bit high in upper stretch, lugged in under a left-handed crop into the final furlong and
proved no match while clear for the place. CRUPI broke out and hit the gate, was urged along while well behind the rest of the field, went four wide around
the turn, moved out while still on his inside lead in upper stretch, accelerated after switching to the proper lead outside the sixteenth-pole and finished very
fast to just miss the place. PERFORM was hustled from the gate, came out leaving the chute, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path
while still inside that foe on the turn, fought under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. ROCKET CAN bumped with a rival at
the start while last to commence, settled well off the pace, was roused three then two wide on the turn, moved much closer late on that bend, came three
wide into the stretch under the crop, moved out some in the drive and lacked the needed response. WADSWORTH bobbled at the start then was hustled,
was carried out some leaving the chute, raced just off the pace under urging, chased three then four wide on the turn and came up empty. POINT PROVEN
was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, went four wide around the turn and failed to respond. OLAZABAL settled on the far outside,
dropped back under urging with a half-mile to run, angled in leaving the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn and retreated. WESTERN GHENT
pressed the pace on the outside of two foes, dropped back while floating five to six wide around the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
WAR LIKE GODDESS tracked the front just off the inside from mid pack patiently handled, tipped to the three path near the five-sixteenths given a notch
and advanced, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, took over command in hand at the three-sixteenths, came under light urging a furlong out as a pair
of rivals latched on to the inside and edged away from the given a quartet of hand urged and was taken back in hand prevailing safely at the end as the rider
pleased. TEMPLE CITY TERROR tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled until tipped to the two then three path near the five-sixteenths, came
under light coaxing at that juncture and angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in running on under a drive fully extended with good energy but proved no
match for the top one. VIRGINIA JOY (GER) just off the pace tracking along the inside, tipped to the two path near the five-sixteenths placed to light
coaxing, angled four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, dug in under a drive rallying in tandem with TEMPLE CITY TERROR running on willingly
to the wire while unable to match the eventual winner. FLANIGAN'S COVE saved ground at the tail of the field until tipped to the two path half a mile from
home, tipped out three wide at the seven-sixteenths and commenced a bid given some rein to work with into and through the far turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and was outkicked to the finish. KEY BISCAYNE established the front and showed the way rated along
the inside uncontested through moderate splits, remained on hold as rivals got busy in behind her midway on the far turn, got roused spinning just off the
inside into upper stretch under threat and was overhauled three-sixteenths from home, then weakened to the wire. TREASURE TAILS just off the inside
near the rear of the field, tipped three to four wide at the three-eighths and came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. PETRICOR (GB) just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under light coaxing at the five-sixteenths and failed to quicken,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch coming up empty and was eased home to the finish.

stretch and finished well to garner the place but failed to reach the winner. OSBOURNE settled on the far outside, was roused five wide on the turn, gained
to make a seven wide bid into upper stretch, battled outside the winner into the final furlong, lost touch with that foe outside the sixteenth-pole and was
outfinished then lost the place while able to get the show. MONEY SUPPLY settled off the pace, was roused three then four wide on the turn, swung seven

Footnotes
CHI TOWN LADY a bit reluctant to load prior to the start, crossed to the two path directly after the break and grew detached at the tail of the field, remained
just off the inside until tipped three then four wide three furlongs from home coming under light coaxing, advanced through the far turn and angled out seven
to eight wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish to close stoutly outside the top pair getting bumped a sixteenth from home as those rivals came
outward when rolling by to the front, then edged away to prevail going away at the end. HOT PEPPERS established the front and showed the way in hand
just off the inside coming under light coaxing half a mile from home while safely in front, swung three wide into upper stretch under growing threat to the
outside, dug in under a drive holding safe to the eighth pole, had the rider switch the stick to the left hand inside that station and came out half a path
bumping MATAREYA into a passing CHI TOWN LADY a sixteenth from home, then ran on to preserve the place honors. MATAREYA three then two wide in
pursuit, tucked inside when circling the backing up ELM DRIVE, at the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and angled out four wide
into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong latching on HOT PEPPERS to the outside a furlong out, dug in unable to get by when
that rival came outwards and was bumped a sixteenth from home and in turn bumped CHI TOWN LADY as she ranged up outside just prior to taking
command, ran on well clear for the show honors. STERLING SILVER coaxed from the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled
four then three wide into upper stretch and weakened. WISH YOU WELL three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide
into upper stretch and tired. NOVEMBER REIN four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and
folded. ELM DRIVE coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under brief coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, retreated along the rail from the
three-eighths and continued along the inside into upper stretch, then faltered in the drive. There was a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the top three finishers
in deep stretch. After review the result was allowed to stand before the race was declared official.

Footnotes
LIFE IS GOOD broke very fast and went clear of the rest of the field quickly, rounded the first turn in the two path, floated five wide onto the backstretch,
strode out while extending the advantage with six furlongs to run, remained out in the five path past the half-mile pole, dropped in nearing the
seven-sixteenths, went two to three wide around the far turn, was asked while having his lead diminish at the five-sixteenths, responded well when shaken
up four wide into upper stretch, dropped in under some threat around the three-sixteenths, came under one pop of a right-handed crop at the furlong
marker, was guided inward in front of HAPPY SAVER but with clearance shortly thereafter, kept finding while drifting out slightly under a strong-hand ride to
the wire and prevailed under good handling. HAPPY SAVER went three wide around the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused leaving the backstretch,
traveled in the two path under urging on the far turn, gained late on that bend, turned into the stretch under the crop while just behind the winner, pursued
that foe while still on his inside lead into the final furlong, switched out outside the sixteenth-pole after the winner dropped in front, continued on his inside
lead to the wire and finished with good courage under a vigorous hand-ride to just get the place. HOT ROD CHARLIE tracked inside around the first turn,
settled in second position while along the rail on the backstretch, saved ground early on the far turn, was given his cue at the three-eighths then shifted
three wide before the five-sixteenths, moved to four wide shortly thereafter, came five wide into the stretch, chased the winner while outside in the drive and
was out-kicked then just missed the place but was well clear for third money. OLYMPIAD was coaxed into the first turn, went three wide around that bend,
floated six wide behind the leader onto the backstretch, dropped back while settling on the outside, was asked inside the half-mile pole, rounded the far turn
in the four path under urging, was driven six wide into the stretch and came up empty. ZOOMER broke a half-step slow then checked while pinched back
between horses, saved ground around the first turn, was reserved at the rear, came under urging near the seven-sixteenths, moved from the rail to the two
path while falling well behind on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and faltered then was distanced but walked off.

Footnotes
ACTION JACKSON saved ground around the first turn, was reserved in the middle of the field, rounded the far turn in the two path, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed with a rush to get up late. CONQUIST broke out and hit the
gate, moved up on the outside to take the lead on the initial straightaway then moved in, showed the way along the rail, was asked near the quarter-pole
then came under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out a path while still in front near the sixteenth-pole, came out a bit more late and bumped his hindquarters
with CURLIN'S WISDOM then was caught while able to hold the place. EXCURSIONNISTE was taken in hand early then rated in the two to three path,
came under urging on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, raced between foes under a drive into the final furlong and finished willingly to get the
show at the wire. CURLIN'S WISDOM was rated while well placed just off the pace on the inside, came under urging near the five-sixteenths, turned into the
stretch in the two path, pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final sixteenth, leaned ever so slightly and bumped the hindquarters of that foe as he
came out some late and was outfinished then lost the show on the wire. DREAMPOINT bumped hard with a foe while also making contact with another rival
after the start then checked, moved in towards the rear, was reserved while saving ground, came under urging nearing the quarter-pole, moved out while
put to a drive in upper stretch, shifted further out around the sixteenth-pole and improved position. SIR JOHN was taken in hand early, rounded the first turn
in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, traveled in the two path on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, chased into upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole and weakened. YOUR MISSION tugged keenly at the bit early, jostled with a foe while
rank nearing the first turn, continued rank under restraint in the two path through that bend, was reserved in the back half of the field, rounded the far turn in
the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole and lacked the needed kick. WALK EM DOWN bumped with a foe after the start, jostled with a rival
nearing the first turn, went two to three wide around that bend, settled off the pace, went three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch
and failed to rally. BIONDI bumped with a rival after the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the far turn,
came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. BERT BERT BERT was taken up with a grab of the right-rein to avoid trouble to his inside
after the start then bobbled, went two to three wide near the back, was urged around the final turn and failed to threaten. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE
STEWARDS' POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF CURLIN'S WISDOM CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST CONQUIST ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, CONQUIST WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FOURTH.
