Footnotes
CATCHING CUPID was bumped at the start then forced into another foe, recovered to stalk the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn,
was given his cue at the quarter-pole, took over in upper stretch, kicked clear outside the furlong marker, drew away while kept to the task into the final
sixteenth then was eased up while much the best. COLD WALKER was hustled to the front, showed the way while off the inside, was asked in the two path
on the turn, turned into the stretch under strong urging, lost the advantage to the winner at the three-sixteenths and proved no match while clear for the
place. DATESFREEDOM unseated his rider and ran loose for about a sixteenth before being caught and brought back to the jockey, raced on the outside
under urging, went four then five wide on the turn, drifted in while still on his inside lead near the eighth-pole, continued on his inside lead in the final furlong
and lacked the needed response while just able to get the show. SENSIBLECONCLUSION was urged along at the rear, went two then three wide on the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and just missed the show. PATRICK THE GREAT broke out and bumped hard with a foe, settled off the pace,
was roused in the two path on the turn and failed to respond. IMPAZIBLE PRINCE was hustled from the gate, dropped back under urging, fell to the rear
before the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. SIGHT UNSEEN bumped with a rival at the start, lugged out a bit leaving the chute,
settled off the pace, went three then four wide while under extra left-rein pressure around the turn, floated six wide into the stretch and faltered. SALT CAY
was bumped hard at the start then forced out into another foe, raced towards the rear under urging, saved ground on the turn, moved into third position at
the five-sixteenths, gained while driven four wide into the stretch, suffered an injury at the three-sixteenths and was pulled up then vanned off.

Footnotes
ANGELINKA (FR) exchanged a light bump with an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the clear leader and to the four path into
the turn, pursued that foe intently while taking the turn in the three to four path, grinded away in upper stretch to bid outside of the leader at the furlong
grounds, dueled before gaining a narrow advantage in the final sixteenth as an outer BAY JEWEL closed in, and fended off that foe through the late stages.
BAY JEWEL broke a step slowly at the start before being nudged by an outer rival soon after, trailed the field two wide into the turn, shifted three wide
turning for home before fanning to the six path entering the lane, produced a good kick outside of rivals in midstretch, rallied through the final furlong in
hopes of making a late bid, menaced nearing the wire, but was kept at bay. VIOLENT POINT cleared early on, set a comfortable pace after shifting to the
three path entering the turn, held sway in upper stretch while shifting back to the rail, but flopped back to his left lead leaving the furlong pole as
ANGELINKA (FR) bid, then yielded to that foe and an outer on-charging rival in the final sixteenth. WEEKEND FUN tracked two wide, was coaxed along to
keep pace in the two path around the turn, shifted outside of the top pair entering the final furlong, but lacked a kick through tight quarters at the sixteenth
pole, then lost that possibility when the hole shut shortly after. OLIVE KAT bumped mildly with an inner foe at the start, tracked while in pursuit of the top
pair from the four to five path around the turn, but lacked a bid in upper stretch before tiring through the final furlong. JEN'S BATTLE saved ground towards
the rear, but to no avail. IT CAN raced forwardly placed three wide early on, but steadily faded outside of foes around the turn.

Footnotes
DAME CINCO was restless in the gate, came away in good order, went three wide around the opening bend, stalked the pace on the outside, took the lead
in the three path midway through the far turn, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole, drifted out under hand-urging in upper stretch, came out more when
put to a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, responded well while switched to a right-handed crop in the final furlong and held under steady urging.
PREPOSTEROUS broke out then bobbled, was taken under snug restraint in the two path on the first turn, was rated just behind the leader, came under
urging in the two path early on the final turn, moved to three then four wide later on that bend, chased the winner while moving in some into the final furlong
and proved no match while able to safely secure the place. BELARUS was hustled to the front then taken in hand, showed the way under a snug hold on
the inside, lost the lead while asked midway through the far turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired while far clear for third money. INFRINGEMENT
brushed the outside of the gate at the start, rounded the first turn in the three path, settled on the outside, dropped back midway down the backstretch,
moved from the three path to the two path on the far turn and faltered. SWEET SENSATION was fractious in the gate then backed out and deemed fit to run
by the state veterinarian before being reloaded, raced in the two path at the rear on the first turn, settled at the back, dropped back under urging inside the
five-eighths, moved from the two path to the four path around the final turn and also faltered.

Footnotes
GHOST GIANT settled off of the pace along the inside, patiently bided time around the far turn, tipped three wide straightening into the lane, showed a good
turn of foot after flopping from, then back to, his correct lead nearing the final furlong, rallied to bear down on a leading RUSE in the closing stages, and
gained an advantage approaching the wire. RUSE stalked along the inside before shifting ground to set up shop outside of the clear pace-setter around the
first turn, moved forward to press that foe approaching the far turn, but was kept at by while chasing through midstretch, progressed to bid at the sixteenth
pole as his counterpart began to falter, claimed an advantage soon after while an outer GHOST GIANT closed in strongly, and was caught in the final fifty
yards. NOT PHAR NOW cleared off entering the first turn, continued to show the way as an outer RUSE pressed into and around the first turn, held sway
from that foe through midstretch, but tired in the final furlong, got headed at the sixteenth pole, and faltered. BARRAGE tracked along the inside, tugged to a
stalking position behind the top two entering the backstretch as the pace slowed, pursued those rivals from the two path around the far turn, but only
managed to chase through the lane while lacking the needed kick to produce a bid. WILD BANKER broke half a beat slowly at the start, laid unhurried while
towards the rear two wide, and failed to menace along the inside through the lane. STRAW INTO GOLD settled off of the pace three wide, got floated to the
four path entering the backstretch, maintained that path and position around the far turn, then lacked a rally while flopping his leads multiple times in
midstretch. QUIET OUT EAST was slow into stride, trailed the field two to three wide around the turns, and made little impact. COTTON tracked two wide,
shifted outside of the top pair entering the backstretch while narrowing the gap due to a slowing pace, but was urged to keep pace in the three path around
the far turn, then tired turning for home.

the far turn, shifted three then four wide outside the quarter-pole, gained to take the lead into upper stretch, responded well while battling inside of a foe into
the final furlong then moved clear in the final sixteenth under good handling. ADDICTED TO YOU tugged at the bit under restraint in the two path around the

urging in the two path early on the turn, angled out under a drive inside the five-sixteenths then bumped with WHISKY WARRIOR, came four wide into the
stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, dropped back outside of two foes into the final furlong and was outfinished then just missed the place
but narrowly earned the show. ON PALM SUNDAY bumped with a foe after the start, quickly sped clear, opened up a sizable advantage in the three to two
path, was asked while seeing his lead diminish on the far turn, lost the advantage under a drive at the three-sixteenths, kept on well in the final furlong but

path, was reserved towards the rear, steadied while in tight outside the half-mile pole, was roused in the two path early on the final turn, came between
horses at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into the stretch and improved position with late energy but missed the superfecta. PIVOTAL RUN broke out

WARRIOR was hustled from the gate, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, went three wide
early on the far turn, was bumped and forced four wide into another rival inside the five-sixteenths then taken up and came up empty. SENSE A GIANT was
bumped at the start then taken up some while having his path taken, dropped from the four path to the two path around the first turn, settled near the back,
was roused in the two path on the final turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DRUID was hustled from the gate, jostled with a foe early
then was taken up while in tight between foes, dropped to the rail from the three path early on the first turn, was taken up off heels when a foe crossed in
front around the three-quarter pole then moved out, raced outside under reserve down the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn, came five wide into
the stretch and failed to rally. SECRET SANCTUARY was bumped on both sides after the start, went four wide around the opening bend, settled off the
pace, moved in outside the half-mile pole, saved ground on the far turn and was no factor.

DONEGAL SURGES chased three wide and between horses while a part of the early scramble in pursuit of the clear leader, got a bit keen when an inner
POP COYER shifted out passing the five furlong pole, backed out so track from off of the pace, was ridden along in the five path around the turn, responded
and picked up stride in upper stretch while taking aim on the top pair, then drove past them at the furlong grounds, and drew off. BLAME IT ON DADDY laid
off of the pace along the inside, was urged along in the two path around the turn, improved while splitting foes two wide entering the lane, hung on his left
lead while tipping three wide nearing the furlong grounds, yet sustained his charge to reach place in the final sixteenth, and held from an outer on-charging
foe late. MR. MARLIN was four wide and between horses as a part of the chasing group behind the clear leader early on, but shied from an inner foe leaving
the five furlong pole causing him to faltered, lost many lengths of position into the turn, trailed in the four path turning for home, swung to the eight path in
upper stretch, rallied willingly outside of foes through the final furlong, but missed reaching place late. CURLY LARRY AND MO cleared early on, showed
the way in the two path into the turn, met MAMA'S GOLD's challenge turning for home, gamely fended off that foe through upper stretch, but proved no
match for another rallying rival at the furlong grounds, and faltered late. MAMA'S GOLD brushed with an inner foe at the start, stalked six wide and outside
of foes, tucked four wide nearing the half mile pole, ranged up well in hand while outside of the leader and in the four path around the turn, bid turning for
home, but was fended off through upper stretch, then weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. RAMBLIN' WRECK was slow early and trailed in
the opening stages, raced far back in the two to three path around the turn, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, and moved up. STORM THE EMPIRE
was backed out to be re-adjusted in the starting gate, bumped with an outer foe leaving it, then chased along the inside, but tired through the lane. POP
COYER bumped with an inner rival at the start, chased two wide and between horses, shifted ground a path out leaving the five furlong pole, then sustained
position around the turn before weakening in upper stretch. IMPRESSOR nudged an outer foe at the start, stalked five wide and between horses early on,
then three wide into the turn before taking the bend in the four path, but tired turning for home.

Footnotes
CLAYTNTHELIONHEART went around the first turn in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, came under coaxing in the three path at the
three-eighths, was asked for more as the runner-up slipped through along the rail at the five-sixteenths, chased that foe into upper stretch, gained into the
final furlong then took the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and drew clear under steady handling. AIR ATTACK saved ground on the first turn, settled
off the rail on the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the far turn, was given his cue outside the five-sixteenths, slipped through inside
of three foes to take the advantage outside the quarter-pole, led under a drive into upper stretch, drifted out while being headed inside the furlong marker
and proved no match late while weakening but held the place. WINTER POOL was hustled from the gate, went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace
on the outside, was asked four wide on the far turn, came under the crop at the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive into the final furlong and tired but
narrowly earned the show. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS was hustled from the start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear on the outside,
was roused three wide on the final turn, came five wide into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. TRUCULENT was hustled to the
front, raced inside around the first turn, showed the way while off the rail on the backstretch, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked under heavy
threat inside the five-sixteenths then lost the advantage shortly thereafter, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
LEN LO LADY stalked two wide and between horses, pressed the leader approaching the turn, bid nearing the lane, vied through upper stretch, and drew
off leaving the furlong grounds. BACKYARD MONEY set the pace while feeling outer pressure from LEN LO LADY into the turn, sparred with that foe
entering the lane, resisted through upper stretch, but gave way at the furlong grounds, and held place thereafter. MAYBE LATER stalked three wide while in
range around the bend, but failed to keep pace with the top pair entering the lane, yet kept on thereafter to secure a minor share. H. T. XENA laid forwardly
placed two wide and between horses for a quarter mile, but failed to maintain that position at the nine-sixteenths pole, came under urging to keep pace in
the two to three path around the turn, shifted five wide while doing so entering the lane, and moved up mildly. ECHO FOXTROT tracked along the inside
while a part of the top flight, but required coaxing to sustain that position around the turn, then only managed to chase through midstretch before fading.
CUPIDS GIRL bobbled slightly before making contact with an inner foe at the start, tracked in midpack in the three path into the turn, shifted four wide
enteirng the lane, and stayed on mildly while lacking a punch. BELLA PRINCIPESSA bumped with an outer foe at the start, then saved ground off of the
pace, but to no avail. PONCHO SONG bumped with an outer foe while being severely jostled between horses at the start, lagged well behind the field
around the bend, and narrowed the gap late while being outrun.

POPPY FLOWER settled towards the rear, moved from the rail to the two path around the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch then moved further out
around the three-sixteenths, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed fast to get the lead inside the sixteenth-pole and proved best while displaying a
strong kick. EMPRESS TIGRESS pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, drew even with the leader into upper stretch then took a
short advantage, battled with DELMONA into the final sixteenth and got the best of the that foe while overtaken by the winner. DELMONA (IRE) was
brushed in the hindquarters early, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the lead
narrowly under a drive in upper stretch, battled with EMPRESS TIGRESS into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the show. MAKIN MY
MOVE was keen under restraint while rated on the outside, traveled three wide around the turn, was asked for her best into upper stretch, chased under a
drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked. HAVE A GOOD DAY (IRE) brushed the hindquarters of a foe early, was well placed just off the pace, drafted
inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, had a slim opening along the rail while chasing the leaders into the final furlong, had the hole tighten
inside the eigthth-pole after not having enough acceleration to come through and was also out-kicked. BREEZE EASY (GB) bumped with a rival at the start,
was rated under a snug hold, started the turn in the two path, shifted three then four wide while asked inside the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive into
the final furlong and weakened. HALF IS ENOUGH bumped with a rival at the start, was taken back while in tight between foes early, raced under strong
restraint near the back, went three wide early on the turn, shifted out four then six wide late on the bend, was placed under a drive into upper stretch and
lacked the needed response. DERRYNANE settled on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, dropped inward in upper stretch and failed to
respond. ARTOS (IRE) was reserved off the pace, dropped back three then four wide around the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
SARATOGA CHROME rushed the gate just before the off, settled off of the pace three wide, tucked to the two path into the far turn while tracking the main
group, shifted out five wide straightening for home, rallied through the final furlong to bid entering the final sixteenth, gained an advantage shortly after as an
outer SUCCULENT closed in, and lasted to the wire. SUCCULENT bumped with an inner foe while last away, trailed comfortably along the inside around
both turns, came into the lane in the four path before tipping six wide approaching the furlong grounds, offered a good kick, surged late in hopes of reeling in
a leading SARATOGA CHROME on the wire, but ran out of ground. LA VICTORIA stalked two wide, vied between horses around the far turn, gained an
advantage in upper stretch before driving clear at the furlong grounds, but was worn down entering the final sixteenth. JOCOSITY stalked three wide,
pressed in earnest around the far turn, but only managed to chase through upper stretch while lacking a bid, then was outkicked for minor rewards by a pair
of foes in the final furlong. CAPITAL GAL was keyed up while uncomfortable between horses crossing the wire for the first time, steadied behind rivals into
the first turn, settled off of the pace two wide, then three wide around the far turn before swinging seven wide entering the lane, and moved up outside of
foes. CAN'T FOOL ME settled off of the pace along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, shifted six wide entering the lane while still inside of
CAPITAL GAL, and improved along with that foe. LEM ME DRINK stalked along the inside, chased in the two path through upper stretch, but lacked a kick
through a narrow seam between horses in the final furlong requiring the rider to check very slightly at the sixteenth pole. TWIST JUST RIGHT bobbled
behind at the start, raced far back while hung four wide, and failed to factor. BERN ROSEY BERN set the pace along the inside, felt pressure from a pair of
outer foes around the far turn, got headed in upper stretch, and weakened at the furlong grounds. POWER AND GLORY saved ground in midpack, but
faded under urging around the far turn. ALESTE tracked two wide and from between horses, but lacked a bid before tiring through the final furlong.
BAVARIAN CREME bumped with an outer foe while off a beat slow, tracked four to three wide, tipped back four wide entering the lane to take aim on the
leading trio, but faltered between horses approaching midstretch.
