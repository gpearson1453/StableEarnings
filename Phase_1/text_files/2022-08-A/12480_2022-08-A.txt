AVALON KING got away alertly to set the pace with a clear lead, swung wide entering the stretch and held safely while kept to task. FINAL FINAL was
steadied on the first turn, saved ground, closed inside and got up for place while no threat to the winner. PAYNTER'S BOY saved ground while never far off
the pace, angled out for the drive, bid and hung. CALIBOGEE was steadied at the start, advanced to the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, bid and
came up empty late. GO FOR A RIDE stalked the pace, bid on the far turn, weakened and faded from contention. BUTTERED NOODLES was through after
a half. Hand timed.

MOUNTAIN PASS broke slowly, raced in the back, swung wide leaving the turn, closed with a rush and got up at the wire. SATURNCLOUD raced in close,
swung wide leaving the turn, closed willingly, assumed command near the sixteenth pole, drew clear and was caught at the wire to just miss.
SONGOFTHEDESERT set a pressured pace, dueled through the stretch, weakened past the eighth pole and held safely for show. WRIGHT WINGED
pressed the pace two wide, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled past the eighth pole and faltered. THECHAMPISFLORING lagged while racing
outside, lacked a bid and was not a threat. BIGGER THAN YOU saved ground and had brief speed only. Hand timed.

the pace, bid six wide leaving the turn, found his best stride, was gaining ground and got up for place. ROUGE SUNSET led early, fell back leaving the turn,
went evenly late and was caught for second. MI MALDITO AMOR raced in the back, bid inside, had little left and did not threaten. SMILING MATT pressed
the pace, challenged between horses and gave way leaving the turn. TOX trailed the field. Hand timed.

Footnotes
CHEROKEE PAPOOSE raced in the back, angled out in the upper stretch, closed with a rush and got up near the wire. DISCERNMENT stumbled at the
start, rallied on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, drew clear past the eighth pole and was caught late. SEVEN POINTS trailed the field, found her
best stride late, was gaining ground and earned show. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER vied to mid stretch, faltered and dropped back. BURNADEBT was never
far back, bid inside leaving the turn and came up empty late. STORM THE PALACE vied to mid stretch and stopped. REIGN OF FIRE showed good early
speed while racing inside, stopped on the turn and dropped back. Hand timed.
