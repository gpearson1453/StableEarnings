VALIANT SPARK chased the pace into the turn, rallied two wide to make the lead at the top of the stretch then widened the balance of the trip under strong
handling to win as much the best. MISS ENCISO away alertly, set the pace along the inside to the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner and
just held on for second by the narrowest of margins. ALITA stalked the pace into the stretch and finished determinedly two wide in the five path. SOLDAT
TEMPTATION well placed, failed to respond. STRAIGHT TO GO lost her footing at the start and trailed.

Footnotes
GRIZABELLA allowed to settle, swung wide, closed rapidly in the middle of the racetrack through the final furlong and got up in time. SAMMY'S SISTER
stalked the pace into the stretch, rallied thee wide to make the lead, drew clear in upper stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. LADY
ABRIL chased the pace and was outfinished. HOOS TAKING CHARGE broke in front and quickly opened a daylight lead, set the pace to the top of the
stretch then gave way. HIGH CUPPER bore out at the start bumping HEIDI'S BACK repeatedly, had her heels clipped then was through after a half. ALL
THE BEST was no factor. HEIDI'S BACK was bumped repeatedly at the start, clipped heels and stumbled unseating her rider leaving the chute. THE
STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED HIGH CUPPER FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE CHUTE AND PLACED
HER SIXTH.
