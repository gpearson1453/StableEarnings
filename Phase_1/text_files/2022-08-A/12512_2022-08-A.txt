MY INSPIRATION Ducked out at the start, in hand four wide, gained along the three path on the last turn, battled and under the whip proved best.
DUTCHMEN FOREVER In hand along the three path, gained two from the rail on the last turn to the inside by the winner, responded, battled and just
missed. ESOR Away best, showed the way along the two path with a lengthy lead, that lead began to diminish and faltered in the crucial stages.
DOMINANT FACTOR In hand along the two path, saved ground on the last turn and failed to threaten. BOSTON BILLY Unhurried along the three path
early, two path on the final turn and failed to fire. BELLAMY'S TREASURE Broke sluggishly, five wide early, four wide on the last turn and tired.
