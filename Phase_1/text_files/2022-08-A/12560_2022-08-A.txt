Footnotes
FUN AND FEISTY attended the pace toward the inside, shifted out a bit and moved up swiftly through the turn, took dead aim entering the lane, reeled in
the leaders and kicked away. BABY GOT BACKSPIN broke sharp, disputed the pace outside, fought on through a long drive but was unable to resist the
winner. EYES OF GOLD was allowed to settle, came four wide and finished fairly well to earn the minor award. ADIVA was slow into stride, rallied between
horses and improved position. MALAWNIA was allowed to settle, came five wide and made a mild advance. PERFECT ROSE lagged well back, finished
with a belated run but was never a factor. ALWAYS SMILING broke a step slow and was never a factor. SHE HAS THE LOOK was forwardly placed for a
half and dropped out. CONVERSATIONAL dueled inside, weakened a furlong out, went wrong and lost the jockey near the sixteenth marker and was
vanned off. KENTUCKY REIGN contended early, was through after a half, was taken up near the sixteenth marker to avoid CONVERSATIONAL, pulled up
just before the wire but walked off.

Footnotes
ROMANCE NOVEL prompted pace three deep, forged a narrow lead nearing the furlong marker, dug in and held stubbornly. LUV DRAGON attended the
pace along the inside, shifted out leaving the turn, tipped out further to be clear a furlong out, kicked on well but was unable to best the determined winner.
JAG WARRIOR tracked four wide, moved up through the turn, but weakened slightly during the drive. SCARLET STRIPE set the pressured pace inside,
contested the issue to the final furlong and gave in. INTRIGUE was allowed to settle off of the inside, got through and finished with a mild improvement.
BROADBAND was unhurried, tucked in to save ground, but passed only the tiring ones. TEXAS LUCKY failed to respond. CALM INSPIRATION contended
between horses to the stretch and dropped out. NOVEMBER ROSE dwelt, came away well behind her field and never recovered.

Footnotes
MEISTER settled under a snug hold, ranged up five wide through the second turn, reeled in the leaders and took over late. TEPEU tracked four wide, drew
even leaving the second turn, fought on but was unable to resist the winner. GULFSTREAM WAY attended the pace along the inside, launched his bid
between horses, forged a narrow lead but grudgingly gave in. LEGIONNAIRE tucked in to save ground, shifted out and advanced between foes, got through
toward the inside entering the stretch, but lacked the needed late response. JELLY NOUGAT stalked three deep, bid between rivals on the second turn, but
came up empty in the drive. HIPPODROME contested the pace along the inside through the second turn and faltered. KISS PRINCIPAL showed little.
DEFIED dueled outside, was collared between horses on the second turn and stopped.

KEY OF LIFE tracked in hand three deep, came to level terms a furlong out and kicked away. BLACK FOREST pulled clear to dictate terms, proved no
match when set down for the drive, but kept on well to clearly prove second best. VALIANT PRAISE was allowed to settle, got through toward the inside and
finished fairly well to earn the show. MOODY was allowed to settle, circled five wide and improved position. REVENUE TRAIN settled saving ground, shifted
out on the turn, but failed to make headway. WILLOW BEND was unhurried, settled saving ground, got through and made a belated gain. DRE ME LESS
was allowed to settle, moved up on the turn, but came up empty entering the stretch and retreated. MARGOINABUBBLEBATH stalked the pace, made a
mild bid three deep, angled in entering the stretch and faltered in the drive. ZOOM ERIN was forwardly placed along the inside through the turn and tired.
ZEITLOS ducked in leaving the chute, hit the rail extension and unseated her jockey. ZEITLOS walked off.

Footnotes
DALIKA (GER) opened clear to dictate terms, was collared on the second turn, relinquished the lead nearing the furlong marker, fought back doggedly to
recapture command and narrowly prevail. PRINCESS GRACE shadowed the leader three deep, moved up to engage DALIKA (GER) into the second turn,
came into the stretch on level terms, poked her head in front a furlong out, battled on but was unable to hold the winner at bay. FAMILY WAY attended the
pace along the inside, shifted out entering the stretch to make her bid, failed to quickened once uncovered and toiled on for the minor award. LILY POND
(IRE) was prominently placed three wide, came under a ride midway through the second turn, but lacked a response. ROUGIR (FR) was wrangled back into
the first turn, settled at the tail of the field, but failed to mount a rally and was never a factor.

CONFIDENCE GAME set the pace early on, was in the two path into the lane and drew away late in the stretch under a steady drive. SIMOVIC chased the
pace early, was in the six path into the lane, made a bid down the lane while lugging in and was no match for the winner in the late stages. FRANK'S
HONOR was a bit slow at the start and raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane under a rally, was lugging in during the stretch and flattened
out late in the drive. TSHIEBWE was bumped at the start and raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run.
FATHER DELAY was reserved early on, raced in the two path into the lane, was altered in and out down the lane to improve position in the final stages.
ACCIDENT was never a threat. CALIFORNIA TWIRL was a tad slow at the start, chased the pace early, was in the two path into the lane and weakened
late in the stretch drive. STORMIN ARMY pressed the pace early three wide, was in the five path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. GASLIGHT
DANCER vied for the lead early from between horses, was in tight near the three sixteenths pole while tiring. AMERICAN DOLLARS was bumped and
bothered at the start. AUGUSTUS BLUE was done early. TEXCOCO was bumped and bothered at the start.

Footnotes
SANTIN came out and bumped foe at the start, raced in the four path along the first turn and stalked the early pace, made a bid near the three eighths pole,
was fanned into the six path entering the lane, under a long drive down the lane and edged clear of foe in the final stages. SMOOTH LIKE STRAIT raced in
the three path along the first turn and set the early pace, came into the lane from the five path while fanning foe out, was put under a long drive down the
lane but gave in and was no match for the winner in the late stages. SACRED LIFE (FR) raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved
up late in the stretch run. SET PIECE (GB) was a bit slow at the start and trailed the field early on, raced in the three to four path along the first turn, was in
the four path into the lane and improved position late in the stretch drive. CAVALRY CHARGE raced in the three path along the first turn and chased the
early pace, made a bid along the far turn, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. ADMISSION OFFICE was bumped at the
start, raced in the three path along the first turn and into the lane while no threat. CELLIST bobbled at the start and was never a factor. FIELD PASS raced
in the two path along the first turn and tracked the early pace, was in the two path into the lane and empty down the lane.
