Footnotes
TRIPPER JOHN rushed from outset and gained command at first step, then never relished that command for a gate to wire score. JUST PLAIN MAD broke
alertly and rated as the solo rival in the second flight, chased the lone front runner from a two path stance around the turn, and finished a clear second but
was unable to run down the gate to wire winner. MR. K W tucked to an inside position shortly after the start, saved ground around the turn, rated as the
inner most of three abreast at upper stretch, and finished willingly for the show. HEARTTHROB HALO lacked a needed rally to end a three wide journey.
SOUTH AL SPARKY came up empty after giving chase from between rivals.

PRICED RIGHT broke alertly, established a comfortable margin along the backstretch, and led every step of the way for a wire to wire victory.
CHIEFWEAVE trekked the three path along the backstretch, maintained that line around the bend, was within striking distance at upper stretch, but proved
no match for tough winner in final furlong. SHANKINSTINE showed reserve in early strides, travelled wide around the hook and lost ground to front runners,
then lacked a needed rally. LIT A SHUCK rated as the lone rival in the second flight along the backstretch, trekked the two path through the bend, then
faded in final furlong. ROBBER lacked a late bid after settling into mid pack and saving ground through the turn. THUNDER JAM was slow into stride and
trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
BLINDEDBYTHEGEES rushed from outset and established a ground saving stance, led the field around the hook, shook clear near the eighth pole, then
just held off the late rallying rival for the score. MYGLORYBEE settled behind the pacesetter while trekking an inside line along the backstretch, saved
ground through the turn, then rallied strongly along the rail and was closing fast on the leader at the finish. HABANERO TOM pressed the pace rom a two
path stance, rated close up at upper stretch, but was outfinished in closing strides. CITY BOY EASTWOOD came up empty after breaking outward and
settling into second flight. HENNY'S TURN lacked a needed rally after being unhurried in early strides and travelling widest of all around the turn.
SNAKEBIT saved ground to no avail. OWEN THE ICE MAN was squeezed back at the start and lost all chance.

Footnotes
LET IT B came away rapidly, led at once and never relished command while shaking off rivals in final furlong. RAVENS REFLECTION broke alertly, tucked
to save ground through the bend, rated on heels of leader at upper stretch, then finished willingly but was denied by wire to wire winner. BOATING PARTY
earned the show with a late rally to end a four path journey. FAST VERDICT improved placing with a late gain after being unhurried in early stages.
INVINCIBILITY loomed off the heels of the front runner while trekking the two path through the opening half before weakening in the crucial strides.
KASILOF rallied mildly after showing reserve through the first call and travelling widest of all at upper stretch. MR. SHAPOOR settled into mid pack along
the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, then tired in final furlong. PRAETORIAN lacked a serious bid after being unhurried in early strides and
trekking the three path at upper stretch.

Footnotes
BATES COURT broke sharply, loomed close up along the backstretch, trekked the two path around the hook, led the field at upper stretch, then held off late
charging rivals in final strides for the score. ROCKET DOCTOR settled into mid pack through opening half, was roused around the bend, then responded
strongly to urging and improved placing in homestretch. A MILLION STARS settled into second flight, trekked three wide through the bend, and finished
willingly to secure the show. RUN CARLOS rated in the second flight along the backstretch, was three wide between rivals at upper stretch, locked into a
stretch duel for show honors but was outnodded at wire and just missed the show. PINK HIGGINS was unhurried through the opening half and passed a
tiring foe in late going. J B GRAY flashed early foot and led the field though first call while saving ground, then eclipsed in crucial strides. KING CHROME
trailed the field, gained experience, and was never involved.

Footnotes
ZYDECO MUSIC settled into mid pack long the backstretch, advanced with a three wide move around the bend, rated three wide at upper stretch, gained a
slim advantage at head of homestretch, then veered in near the eighth pole, and finished under a stiff drive for the score. MELODY ROSE was unhurried
along the backstretch, swung wide through the turn, then rallied strongly mid track to ern the place. GOLDEN SMILES settled into mid pack and trekked the
three path before improving placing with late interest. LOVE TO LEARN pressed the pace from an inside pose, rated close up as the inner most rival three
abreast at upper stretch, came under rousing and was rallying along the inside before being forced to check at the eighth pole to avoid a veering rival.
ROMANTIC BEAST showed reserve through the opening half and passed a tiring foe in homestretch. HURRICANE TIZWAY flashed early speed and led
the field along the backstretch before retreating rapidly in the crucial strides.

Footnotes
HERE COMES NOMERCY led at first step and steadily widened margin on field for a clear and convincing score. MAYWON was unhurried along the
backstretch, tucked to save ground around the bend, then rallied strongly along the rail to earn the place, but was no match for runaway winner. APRIORITY
MAGIC established an inside stance shortly after the start, rated in second flight and pressed the front runner at upper stretch, then was caught in final
strides for the place honors. PHARME'S PHINALE trailed the field through first call, swung to be widest of all at upper stretch and improved placing with late
interest. THE CAT CAME BACK came up empty in crucial portion of contest after giving chase from between rivals. GOLDEN HAMMER rated three wide in
second flight along the backstretch and into the turn, lost ground to front runner through the bend, and came up emtpy in closing strides.
