Footnotes
RANSIER bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, was sent for the lead between horses early, showed the way up the backstretch and while
saving ground around the turn and turned back a bid in upper stretch to draw off in the final furlong. EIGHT MAKAR hopped up leaving the gate, trailed the
field through the opening quarter of a mile, beginning a sweeping bid from the three path coming around the turn, dueled outside in upper stretch and could
not go with the winner late, chasing that rival home. SILVER DADDY raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from
the three path, swung wide entering the stretch, was held in a straight line by his rider and gained ground on the outside late. EXTREMELY WICKED
bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, recovered to track the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and
weakened in the final furlong. HUNKY DUNN raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, angled in to save ground around the turn and made no
bid. LEA COSTA ME pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, headed into the turn in the two path, raced into traffic and took up sharply near the
three eighths pole and was empty from there. AX 'S SHORE pressed the pace on the outside in the opening stages, navigated the turn in the three path and
tired in the lane. DON DANIEL raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was not a factor.

stretch and held that margin to the wire under a drive. DESERT SPIRIT raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, began a bid from the three path
coming around the turn, dueled down the lane, was bumped by PASSION BELLE near the eighth pole, forced into RUNNING FOR GRACE in the same
incident and finished well from there. PASSION BELLE raced outside at the back of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, began a four wide bid
nearing the three eighths pole, drifted in in upper stretch, bumping with DESERT SPIRIT in the process, and chased the winner home. MARQUIS LIGHTS
raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, dropped back while racing in the two path around the turn, switched to the outside in upper stretch and
rerallied to gain ground late. RUNNING FOR GRACE pressed the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, raced in the three path around the
turn, was bumped and forced over when PASSION BELLE drifted in in midstretch and finished evenly from there. NO REGRETS N LOVE raced in the
middle of the pack between horses in the opening stages, came around the turn in the two path and gained ground mildly in the lane while never
threatening. MISS BRIGHT TOWN tracked the leaders on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and tired in the lane. EMMYS SILVER

the stretch in the five path and was empty from there. QUESTA angled over to race inside while trailing the field up the backstretch, navigated the turn in the
three path, swung wide entering the stretch and was not a factor. SUERTUDA dueled for the lead between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the turn and faded in the lane. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS FILED CONCERNING THE INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, THE

Footnotes
ELLIOT raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began a five wide bid approaching the quarter pole, and gained ground on the outside to get
up late. WATFORD dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and into the lane, drifted out mildly in
late stretch and was caught in the final strides. MCTHANKS dueled between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, battled from the three path
around the turn and into the stretch, was pushed out slightly when WATFORD drifted out mildly late, and just missed. LONZO WHO pressed the pace while
racing up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. HENRY ON THE RUN bobbled
slightly leaving the gate, recovered to track the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was outkicked in the final
furlong. SOUTHWESTERN HOPE led the field from the inside in the early going, dueled while saving ground around the turn and faded in the lane. COLOR
ME GONE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and was empty from there. THE LAST FEAT
stalked the front runners on the far outside up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn, swung wider still entering the stretch and faded to the
wire. QUANTUM BULL raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and made no
bid. SNOW IN THE NORTH dropped back to trail well behind the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.
