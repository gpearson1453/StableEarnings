Footnotes
SPRITZER led the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, turned back a challenge in midstretch and held his margin to the wire. SCOOBER
hit the gate leaving it, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid in upper stretch and couldn't go with
the winner late, the best of the rest. SWEET STREET raced off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path,
swung wide into the stretch and gained ground mildly to the wire while never threatening the top two. BLOKE raced in the middle of the pack in the early
going, came around the turn in the two and three path and was empty from there. GENIUS pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from
the two path around the turn and weakened while drifting in in the final furlong. GIRO D'ORO trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BIONDA SUPRISE was slow to start and trailed, loomed seven wide at the top of the stetch, and rallied down the center to win. C C'S FREEDOM was
unhurried from inside, was driven through an opening on the rail rounding the far turn, and ran on for place. TIZ NENA raced in midfield from the two path,
was ridden along from the three path into the stretch, and stayed on for show. BYEGONE DAYS rated from the two path, fanned out to the seven path at the
top of the lane and improved. MAP THE MOMENT raced in midpack from the three path, was ridden five wide into the stretch, drifted in passing the eighth
pole, and finished evenly. TEA IN CHINA led from the two path, opened up rounding the far turn, was cued passing the three sixteenths pole, but yielded.
OSA chased three wide but was tired coming into the stretch. HIGH ARABIAN stalked from the rail, was driven three wide into the stretch, steadied passing
the sixteenth pole, and was eased. V K STAR prompted the pace from the three path, was ridden from the three path rounding the far turn, but faded down
the stretch. RUNNING ON ENTRY tracked between foes but dropped out rounding the far turn.

Footnotes
CHICK'S SHADOW raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two
path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, pulled clear in the final furlong and held that margin to the wire while drifting mildly late. LADY DOMINANCE
raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the four path,
gained ground on the outside down the lane and chased the winner to the wire. WAYWARDNESS raced in the three path around the first turn, dueled on
the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the far turn and in upper stretch and weakened late. STARRY HOPE raced in
the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far turn from the three path and finished
evenly on the rail. SIMONELA trailed the field from the three path in the early going, moved up on the outside coming up the backstretch, challenged from
the three path coming around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. FOGGY DREAMS chased the leaders on the inside through the opening half mile,
began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and faded further in the stretch. BEACH HOUSE led the field while racing eagerly around the
first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, gave way while saving ground around the far turn and tired quickly in the lane.

PRINCESS CORA stalked inside, was cued two wide at the top of the stretch, rallied between foes passing the eighth pole, and held. RED WIND chased
from the four path, bid four wide passing the eighth pole, but hung to place. LADY NOY rated in the three path, swept four wide into the stretch, and stayed
on to show. GIVEITSOMEWELLIE trailed from the two path, was hard held while trying to shift outside into the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, and
improved. PALMGIRL prompted three wide, bid three wide at the top of the lane, but flattened. TRUE ATKA raced in midpack from inside, was hustled while
saving ground around the turn, but was empty. MASTERING BELA raced from well back and two wide, was driven from the three path into the stretch, but
was no menace. UPSIDE DOWN set the pace, was coaxed from inside at the top of the lane but yielded. CHEERFUL CHIMES tracked from the three path
but was never a factor.
