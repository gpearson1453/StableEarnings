Footnotes
HAPPY GAL pressed from outside early, lost touch briefly into the turn, came back to challenge in the two path around the bend, took over nearing the
stretch, kicked clear at the eight pole and held in the end. BALENCIAGA BETTY broke a step slow, chased two then three wide around the bend, finished
willingly from outside and nosed out HEART OF THE NIGHT for second. HEART OF THE NIGHT raced up close on the inside then tipped two wide on the
turn, finished well in deep stretch and missed the place. QUEENZY coaxed to the front and set the pace with rivals on both sides early, cleared briefly into
the turn, met the challenge from HAPPY GIRL on the turn, lost command leaving the bend, could not keep up with the winner entering the furlong grounds
and flattened to fourth. LA PEER sat off the pace, angled to the rail on the turn and saved ground to the stretch, started to make a run but lacked room
entering the final furlong and gained a clear path once it was too late. LA PALOMA BLANCA close up early then drifted in and lost ground, traveled along
the inside then tipped out into the stretch and failed to rally. BOLT'S BROAD came away slow from outside, trailed two wide into the turn, angled outside a
pair of rivals and came four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. DREAM STATE up close early four deep then dropped back a bit and angled in to
race outside a rival, lost ground around the turn while three wide and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
LI'L GRAZEN got bothered a bit at the start, stalked the top trio outside a rival, launched a bid at the quarter pole, cleared at the top of the stretch and
powered away under hand urging and a tap of right-handed encouragement. TROUBLE N PARADISE vied for command inside rivals to the turn, dueled
through the bend then lost command nearing the stretch, could not kick on with the winner at the top of the lane but stayed on to secure second. IT'S A
RIDDLE raced near the back early, saved ground around the bend, moved out in the stretch and rallied for the show. LADY PROTONICO was off slow in
the beginning, trailed early on, went three then two wide on the turn, showed a mild response when asked and earned a minor award. MAYCEE JO broke
out but still away quickly, vied between rivals up the backstretch, dueled outside TROUBLE N PARADISE on the turn then vied between briefly past the
quarter pole, chased the winner two wide into the drive and flattened out. ISLAND LIFE vied outside a pair of rivals for the early lead, lost contact at the
three-eighths pole, chased three wide into the drive and faded. QUEEN VERRAZANO broke out, sat near the back of the field early, dropped back to last on
the turn while two then three wide and failed to threaten. RIGHTEOUSLY bobbled shortly after the start, stalked the top trio in range, went two wide into the
turn, angled out and exited the bend four wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
GIMME MO BABY got bumped and crowded between foes early, settled in the two path then moved inside, angled out in the lane and drew along the leader
in the final sixteenth and prevailed over KITTY KITANA (GB) at the wire. KITTY KITANA (GB) was off slow to begin, settled in the two path near the back,
moved to the inside, tipped out into the stretch, closed in tandem with GIMME MO BABY and just missed. ADELIE (IRE) broke in and bumped rival,
steadied between soon after, tucked inside, saved ground into the lane, then steered out and put in a late run to gain third. VELVET was a bit fractious in
the gate, came away slow from inside, pulled a bit early on, gained on the far turn and took aim a bit off the rail into the drive and could not find the needed
late kick in deep stretch. PELIGROSO sped clear and crossed over to the inside, opened up on the backstretch, held a shorter lead while still clear into the
stretch and yielded with a sixteenth remaining. TIERGARTEN broke well then steadied briefly when the leader crossed over, chased two wide then outside
a rival on the far turn and weakened. RUTHLESS BUT KIND was off slow and crowded at the start, altered in from behind rival and ran into the rail, came
four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. RED TIARA got bumped leaving the gate, became rank then got crowded between rivals shortly after, steered to
the inside, angled three wide around the far turn and was not a factor. UNWHIRLED got bumped early, put in a bit tight early on the first turn, settled two
wide, between foes into the far turn and had little left for the stretch. GRANOLA GIRL tracked three then two wide on the first turn, entered the second bend
three deep got crowded between foes past the five-sixteenths then dropped back and raced two wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
GO JOE WON stumbled a bit from inside then went up to take control in the two path, maintained a short lead to the far turn, led three wide into the lane,
resisted into deep stretch and held gamely. HERO STATUS up close four wide early, rated to moved into a stalking position, got boxed in and tugged up on
heels at the half-mile pole, steered out on the far turn and came six wide into the stretch, drew alongside and dueled with the winner in the final sixteenth
and was denied. PALAGIO pressed from outside or three wide on the first turn, pushed upon through the far turn and challenged four wide into the stretch,
got brushed by the winner in upper stretch, lost touch in the furlong grounds, then drifted to the inside and held the show. DONNER LAKE chased five wide
around the first turn, went four wide into the far turn, bid five wide outside rivals and weakened in the final furlong. LORD SHELDON pulled five then four
wide on the first turn, tracked three deep to the second, steered out and entered the stretch six wide and failed to threaten. PRACTICAL IMPACT went two
wide into the first turn then angled to the rail, saved ground to the stretch and weakened. SURROGATE chased four then three wide on the first turn, went
two wide into the second bend, eased out and entered the lane four to five wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
GOLDINI bumped leaving the gate, stalked in the two path, bid outside the leader into the far turn and dueled around the bend, carried a short lead into the
deep stretch and would not be denied. COOL YOUR JETS settled three then two wide on the first turn, raced outside a rival up the backstretch, came four
wide into the drive, drifted in and drew alongside the top pair at the sixteenth pole and could not get by the winner. CONSTANT CONFLICT sped to the front
and moved inside, dueled around the far turn and into the stretch, fought back through the lane and went gamely to the wire. WEEGEE got bumped on both
sides at the start, stalked a bit off the rail early, waited for room on the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, lacked room through the final furlong and
could not gain a clear path. RVINDICATED stalked off the rail, came three wide into the drive and lacked the needed late kick in deep stretch. HOODLUM
was off slow to begin, taken back early, became rank into the first turn, angled out in upper stretch and improved. BARNFIELD was off a bit slow, got
brushed nearing the first turn, stalked on the inside then tipped to the two path on the second bend and weakened. TODAY MATTERS got shuffled between
rivals and became rank early, went three deep into the first turn at the back, angled out and exited the second bend five wide and failed to menace.
ETHAN'S ANIMAL hopped a bit come away slow, pulled and had to steady to avoid running up on heels early, tucked along the rail on the first turn, went
two to three wide on the second bend, moved back to the inside in the stretch and faded. BRAVESTONE broke in and bumped rival at the start, traveled two
wide at the back early on, angled five wide on the far turn and made no impact.

Footnotes
PAMMY'S READY chased between early, two wide around the bend, tipped outside the top pair and bid three deep with a furlong remaining, took over while
drifting out midstretch and drove clear. WOODBINE WAY paused briefly when the leaders were crossing over, chased inside a pair of rivals into the turn,
checked past the three-eighths pole, raced two wide into the lane, angled out and finished gamely for second. BABY STEPS dueled for command outside of
STRESSED, inched ahead on the turn, clung to a short lead entering the final furlong, lost command midstretch and weakened late. SNARK got bothered
by outside rival coming in early then steered inward, went two wide around the bend, angled out in the stretch and kept on through the lane to round out the
superfecta. STRESSED dueled for the lead with BABY STEPS, fought back along the rail through the turn and into the stretch, stayed on to midstretch and
weakened in the final sixteenth. DEL MAR DRAMA was rank at the start and came away well behind the field, saved ground around the bend and improved
position. CHAMPAGNE CAMIE came early, tracked off the rail then came four wide into the drive and failed to respond when called upon. THE ARCADIAN
WAY chased three deep into the turn, remained three wide to the stretch and weakened. THE TRAINER OF WOODBINE WAY LODGED AN OBJECTION
AGAINST PAMMY'S READY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE INTO THE TURN. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THE VIDEO
PROVIDED INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
JEWELOFAKID chased four then three wide early, raced between foes then came four wide into the lane, challenged the leader at the eighth pole and
proved best in deep stretch. SQUILLIONS off slow in the beginning, went five then four wide around the first turn, pulled the rider along and advanced up
the backstretch, launched a bid with thee furlongs remaining, dueled around the far turn, put away inner rival in upper stretch then met the challenge from
JEWELOFAKID, fought gamely through the final furlong but had to settle for second best. SO SOFTLY away quickly to take the early lead and moved to the
inside around the first turn, opened up a comfortable lead on the backstretch, challenged around the far turn and relinquished command with a quarter mile
left to run, could not kick on at the top of the lane and churned on to save the show. PARCO was off a bit slow to begin, got crowded between rivals and
checked shortly after, became rank on the first turn, split foes on the far turn then split another pair in the stretch and kept on through deep stretch. SLAM
DIEGO was off a step slow to begin, traveled three deep around the first turn, took closer order nearing the far turn, exited the bend three wide and
weakened. BIG ROSIE raced up close off the rail on the first turn, saved ground through the second bend and faded. NO PEOPLE raced along the inside
into the first turn then drifted out a bit around the bend, traveled off the rail into the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to make an impact.
FLIPLIT raced rank in the two path on the first turn, settled between then outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch, weakened. BALI DANCER raced
along the inside near the back, entered the stretch a bit off the rail and lacked further response.
