Footnotes
CREATIVE MIND was urged along the inside disputing the pace from the outset, was headed by several rivals nearing upper stretch but continued with a
grudging effort in a prolonged drive to narrowly prevail under brisk handling. LAPIS LAZULI was rated off the first flight outside a rival in the opening stages,
tipped three wide nearing the turn while being prompted to press the issue between foes entering the bend, dueled for command between foes in a
protracted skirmish to late stages but was just outkicked. PURE ROCKET switched outside rivals early dropping off the second flight, advanced four wide
nearing the turn, pressed the issue three wide through the bend striking the front, then past midstretch but weakened late. MR. COUGAR settled last in early
stages, was fanned six wide racing into the stretch and gained some position while making no real impression. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM angled to the inside
tracking off the first flight under light rating to the turn but offered no rally. CHICKEN TRUCK retreated early. GIVE EM HECK BECK briefly disputed the
pace outside the eventual winner but gave way between foes racing into the turn.

Footnotes
REEF'S DESTINY raced four wide between foes tracking off the first flight in the opening quarter, angled inwards after a half to track the leaders between
foes, responded leaving the turn while shifting out three wide to advance on the leaders and went clear late under firm encouragement. MATTS FIRE N ICE,
off slowly, then brushed at the start, was urged to the inside disputing the pace through the backstretch, dueled for command to midstretch but proved no
match when confronted by the winner. STORMIN HONGKONG broke outwards brushing a rival, was settled last racing to the turn, split foes in late stages
and continued with some belated momentum to prevail for a share. LESLIE'S GOLD broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival through the
backstretch into the lane but weakened late. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, switched outside foes
entering the lane but had no rally. YOU SPLIT TENS, bumped at the start, was caught wide in early stages and proved no threat. MILTONTOWN broke
outwards bumping YOU SPLIT TENS, was righted to track the leaders between foes but faded early.

Footnotes
STAGECOACH BOYS was rated along the inside tracking the leaders from out of striking distance, switched off the inside racing into the far turn, swung
four wide nearing upper stretch advancing to challenge, struck the front midstretch, ducked out in late stages but prevailed under firm encouragement.
ANGEL'S MAGIC, caught a bit wide racing to the first turn, tracked off the first flight outside a rival to the backstretch, pressed the issue three deep racing
into the far turn, resisted the winner's bid racing past midstretch but couldn't contain that rival. KAL EL settled off the second flight along the inside racing to
the backstretch, switched out entering upper stretch and continued with some late interest to edge a rival for a share on the wire. TAHKODHA KNIGHT,
forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the first flight, was urged to bid between foes in that path nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick.
OPTION was urged pressing the pace outside a rival in the opening half, dueled for command inside foes through the far turn into the lane and faded late.
TIGER HUNTER, pinched back at the start, settled last to the backstretch and never gained contention. FLY WITH CLASS proved no factor. FINAL VISION
was urged disputing the pace along the rail to the backstretch and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
KIERKEGAARD broke out bumping at the start, was collected while shifting out to track the pacesetter three deep between foes in second flight, steadily
advanced in that path to challenge for command in upper stretch, shifted inwards once gaining the advantage but went clear under firm encouragement. HI
HO CHEERIO angled to the inside in early stages while being rated behind the second flight, advanced along the rail to challenge inside the pacesetter in
upper stretch, lost some momentum in close quarters nearing midstretch, tipped out in late stages but couldn't match terms with the winner. JACK'S
ADVANTAGE settled along the inside racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and displayed some late interest to prevail for a share. DOCTOR K
sprinted clear of the field while angling over from the break, set the pace on a clear margin a bit off the rail to upper stretch but gave out midstretch once
headed by the top pair. PASSED BY PAUL tracked the leader four wide in second flight through the backstretch and steadily faded into upper stretch. MAN
U was urged to a forward placing between foes leading the second flight into the turn and emptied out nearing upper stretch. LIBERTARIAN proved no
factor.

Footnotes
MIZZANNA angled to the inside in early stages tracking just off the pacesetter while pulling against restraint racing through the first turn, shifted out three
wide nearing upper stretch advancing on the leaders to challenge for command and went clear late under firm handling. SHE B GLAMOROUS was settled
outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled out five wide racing through the stretch but continued with solid late momentum to edge a
rival for the place honors on the wire. HOITY TOITY, pulling a bit against rating racing to the first turn gaining a forward placing, prompted the pacesetter
through the backstretch, took over racing through the far turn, briefly resisted the winner's bid but proved no match late. SUPERSTAR BEA was rated off the
second flight along the inside in early stages, gained some position inside foes nearing the lane, then tipped out three wide in the closing stages while
continuing willingly between foes. LIZZ A BEE was reserved off the second flight to the backstretch, split rivals just off the inside racing into the stretch and
finished evenly inside foes late. BIG NEWS COMING, reserved outside foes near the back in the opening half, angled to the rail racing into the far turn and
continued inside foes to gain some position. NOFANSINTHESTANDS broke inwards bumping INDAWIN, was reserved along the inside to the far turn,
angled out six wide racing through the stretch but made no impact. SILVERA sped to the lead while angling to the inside, set the pace to the far turn and
gave way into the lane. INDAWIN broke slowly, then was forced in at the start, settled last along the inside early and failed to menace thereafter. JAGGED
ARROW ducked in at the start, then was pulling against restraint in early stages, switched outside foes on the backstretch, continued four, then five wide
nearing the land faded six wide in the closing stages. NORTHERN ALLIANCE, caught four wide racing to the first turn tracking off the first flight, continued
four wide through the far turn and emptied out into the lane. TEQUILA MARY tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and faded racing into the far
turn.

APPRECIABLE joined the pace four wide in the opening stages, continued to press the issue outside a rival into upper stretch and edged forward late under
firm handling. YELLOW DRESS was urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset into the bend, dueled inside the winner past midstretch but
yielded to that rival late. SECRET MISTRESS, in touch between foes in the first flight prompting those rivals, dropped off the leaders racing into the turn,
shifted out three wide racing through the stretch and produced a second effort to prevail for a share on the wire. OUTWORKTHEOKIEGIRL was urged
inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. HOUSE OF TARGARYEN, forwardly placed five wide tracking just
off the first flight racing to the turn, steadily faded into upper stretch. RUNAWAY A. TRAIN was rated off the first flight shifting off the inside racing to the turn
and gave way early. SHE'S NOT TO BLAME broke awkwardly bumping a rival, was settled last while angling to the inside and never proved a threat.
CREDIT CARD FRAUD bobbled at the start brushing a rival and retreated from contention early.

Footnotes
TONKA WARRIOR ducked out at the start crossing the path of YIP YIP KIP, was collected, then rated off the second flight near the inside racing to the
backstretch, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch bumping NO SLO MO, but produced a steady late response to edge forward from between foes
to prove best under strong handling. NO SLO MO rated along the inside in second flight racing to the first turn, tipped out entering the backstretch to track
off the leaders three wide racing to the far turn, was bumped while being fanned five wide racing into upper stretch but continued with interest to prevail for
the place honors on the wire. MYOPIC hopped at the start, tracked off the second flight along the inside, pulled a bit gaining position inside foes on the
backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, came through inside the pacesetter to challenge for command midstretch but was outkicked. JUSTICE
WARRIOR sped to the lead from the break, dictated the pace on a clear margin to the far turn, tipped off the rail entering the stretch while being roused to
maintain his advantage but weakened late. KING OF THE KIDS, reserved while angling to the inside early, saved ground to upper stretch and continued
with an effort to improve position. TEST PILOT, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, was prompted to make a brief bid on the
far turn but proved empty in the drive. STAR MISSION tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to the backstretch and faded after a half. YIP YIP
KIP, off slowly, then cut off at the start, settled last to the backstretch and passed inside tiring rivals. SOUPER FORTUNE caught four wide racing to the
backstretch tracking the leaders in second flight, faded from contention early. DELFT BLUE tracked the leaders three wide between foes dropping off the
second flight to the backstretch and offered no rally. CAN'T BEAT ME tracked the leaders three wide between foes in second flight and retreated early.
SEEKING SPLENDOR broke awkwardly, was caught wide early and proved no threat.
