QUICKTRIP VAN tracked the leaders from the two path then made a two wide bid on the turn and moved out to three wide in upper stretch to take the lead
at the eighth pole and drew off. I'M A COOL CAT pressed the pace from the two path then took the lead at the five furlong pole was pressured by outside
rival, was caught at the eighth pole while tiring but able to hold the place. WIN FOR FUN raced near the back to the final turn, made a three wide bid on the
turn then moved out to five wide in upper stretch but couldn't match strides with the winner. THREE FOR THREE stumbled at the start then was unhurried
while saving ground to the final turn made a two wide bid on the turn move out to four wide in the stretch and was gaining but too late. TULSA TIME roused
to the lead from the inside was caught at the five furlong pole and slowly faded. MUCHO GIFTED went five wide into the first turn then steadily advanced
down the backstretch to vie for the lead around the final turn and weakened. WALKIN TALKIN BOB saved ground to no avail.
