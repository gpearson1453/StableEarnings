Footnotes
BEAR CREEK pressed the early pace while racing just to the outside of Uncle Early, moved up between rivals in the stretch and finished strongly to just get
up under all out pressure. BLICHTON coaxed along early near the inside, moved up three wide through the far turn, swung five wide into the upper stretch
and just missed in a game effort. UNCLE EARL was quick to begin to set the early pace from the inside, was clear near the eighth pole and kept on willingly
to the wire. CAPTAIN MAD JACK stalked the pace down the backstretch and had no response in the drive while racing four wide.

SHAMMAH was off slowly, rushed to contention from outside of rivals, raced three wide through the far turn, was five deep into the upper stretch and
finished gamely to the wire. I STRONG stumbled at the break, chased the early pace, raced two wide near the quarter pole, angled out four to five wide near
the eighth pole for racing room and finished willingly to the wire. SLIPPERY WHEN WET vied for the early lead from the inside and weakened a bit in the
final stages. DR. HYDE was off slowly, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole, angled in and had no rally.

turn, shifted three wide in his stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. CLOONTIA was unhurried early, moved up five wide near the three sixteenths
pole and raced evenly late. WILD WINTER was slow early, moved up three wide near the quarter pole, angled five to six wide and had no late rally.

Footnotes
EAGLES PALACE settled to the middle of the pack early on, moved up four wide through the far turn and finished well to edge clear late under strong
pressure. AUDACIOUS ANTOINE was unhurried early on, made a good advance through the far turn, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and
closed well to get up for the place position. LEGIO was void of early speed, moved up three wide near the quarter pole, shifted out six wide in the stretch run
and made a good late gain. GENERALONAMISSION chased the early from the inside down the backstretch, moved up two wide between rivals in the
stretch run and moved up to improve position. OVER IT was coaxed along early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid.
ABE HONESTLY vied for the early lead and weakened the final furlong. KIANG was coaxed along from the inside and lacked a bid. WILD ENOUGH
dropped back early, moved up six to seven wide into the stretch, shifted in and never threatened. HARTEL failed to sustain a bid. FAST AXTON vied for the
early lead while racing two wide and faded.

raced towards the outside in the stretch run and had not enough for the top trio late. SURF AND TURF was slow early on, moved up along the inside around
the far turn through the stretch run and had not enough. HARD COUNT tracked the early leader while racing two wide and faded. FLATTER ME PLEASE

Footnotes
BOOMIN GOOSE was unhurried early, raced widest in the stretch run and finished strongly to get up under steady pressure. HOLY TRUTH settled off the
early pace, moved up five to six wide in the lane and made a good late rally. COOPER'S CRESCENT pressed the early leader while racing two wide, led
near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. MAMBOCELLO raced off the early going, moved up near the rail and closed in too late. RED CAT (CHI)
stalked the pace, raced four to five wide and weakened the final furlong. TAPSOLUTION stalked the pace, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole
and had no final winning bid. POLLOCK was sent along from the outside to set the pace and gave way. LAUDERDALE settled early, raced four wide
between rivals in the lane and lacked a bid. SHAKEDOWN dropped back early, raced five wide in the lane and never was a factor. GO HIPPO GO dropped
back early and failed to respond.
