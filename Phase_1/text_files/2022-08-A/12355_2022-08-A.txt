MOBILIZER forced the early pace, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. PAPERBACK HERO stalked the
early leaders and had a bid on the turn but with the lead from the four path in mid stretch was outfinished. KING OF AWESOME showed speed from the
inside but lost ground on the turn and held show. CINNAMONJAWBREAKER was up close but chased on the turn and from the three path at the top of the
stretch faded. SALT MINE TEDDY settled off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off.

DANCE FOR GOLD set the pace, took command on the turn and from the three path through the stretch was much the best. SHE AINT NO JOKE tracked
the early leaders and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. HALTON was away alertly and
moved up on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. FLEEKA was well back and showed little in a dull effort.
LIBERTYINBLUE stalked the early leader but lost ground on the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
TIZ MY RIGHT was in range, a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. BREATHLESSNTHESAND
stalked the early leader, had a clear lead on the far turn and vied through the stretch but was outgunned. LOQUACIOUS was unhurried early and had a mild
gain on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. DETERMINATOR was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but had no
late kick. NIGHT WATCHMAN was well back, trailed the field on the far turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. A I INITIATIVE was off the pace and
roused on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no response. GIANT MINE was in mid pack and hustled along on the far turn but
from the six path at the top of the stretch had no impact. SEAL TEAM TWO showed speed from the outside and had a good position on the far turn but
came up empty.

VERRAZANO LEGACY was off slow and with a clear lead on the turn was much the best. CORE was unhurried early, roused from the inside on the turn
and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for place. DEVIL IN HER HEART tracked from the inside and was a factor on the turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch leveled off. INNUENDO was off the pace, hustled along on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was the
best of the rest. HIGH RESERVE was away alertly but trailed the field on the turn and was not a factor. ARTIE'S ALL IN was in touch but chased on the turn
and dropped back through the stretch.
