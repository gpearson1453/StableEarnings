Footnotes
LITTLEBITAMEDAL chased between rivals early, moved up at the quarter pole, came wide into the stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong, dug in gamely
outside of NICK THE CARDSHARK and prevailed in the final yards. NICK THE CARDSHARK chased inside rivals early, advanced at the quarter pole,
came wide into the stretch, rallied between horses in midstretch, dug in gamely inside of the winner and battled to the wire. DESHACKLED showed good
early speed, opened up a comfortable lead, began to weaken at the eighth pole and stayed on for the show spot. MANOLETE raced off the pace inside,
came two wide into the stretch and closed belatedly inside. TAPSOLUTE chased three wide and lacked a rally. IMA COALMAN raced two wide off the pace
and did not factor.
