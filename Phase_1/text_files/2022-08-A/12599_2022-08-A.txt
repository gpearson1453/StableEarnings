Footnotes
I LOVE YOU MORE was unhurried and rated well back along the backstretch, closed the gap rapidly around the bend, split foes near the three sixteenths
pole and rallied with fury in final furlong to get up in time for the score. COPPER BELLE hustled from outset, gained command near the half pole, trekked
the two path around the turn, had a clear advantage at the eighth pole, but was caught in final stride by the rallying rival. MONGOLIAN DIAMOND failed to
fend off top pair after rushing from outset and leading the field through the first call. SHAMEFUL PRINCESS lacked a needed rally after settling into second
flight and travelling widest around the turn. J M SKY CLASSIC pressed the early pace from a three path stance, then began to fade out of contention mid
turn. SWEET GIBSON was bumped at break, dropped head and lost rider.

Footnotes
LIL ALLIE DANCER tucked behind early front runners to save ground, angled out mid turn, then ran down leader in final furlong for the victory. GLITTER
TIME rushed from outset and set the early in unison as the outer rival of two abreast, established sole command at upper stretch, but was unable to fend off
the rallying rival in final furlong. KELLYS THE BOSS settled into mid pack and trekked the two path into the turn, then split foes near the eighth pole while
under urging and rallied mildly for the show. MARY ALICE showed reserve through the opening half before improving placing with late interest.
SALACIOUSACUSATION came up empty after giving chase to pace setting pace from between rivals while rating amidst the second flight. NEW YEAR'S
PARTY travelled widest of all along the backstretch and through the turn before gaining mildly in closing strides. ACTIVE GIRL was unhurried along the
backstretch, trekked an inside line into the turn before swinging wide at upper stretch in attempt to advance, then drifted inward near the eighth pole and
came up empty in the end. O CHITA flashed early speed and established an inside stance while setting the pace through the first call in tandem with
GLITTER TIME before fading in crucial stages. FIRE OF GOLD steadily faded to end a three path journey. SARAHS HOME was awaiting options and rated
mid pack along the backstretch, trekked the four path around the bend, lacked room inside the eighth pole, and weakened in final furlong.

Footnotes
PA MA'S AMOS tucked to rail shortly after the start to save ground around opening bend, swung to three wide inside the half pole and at upper stretch, then
rallied to win the stretch duel. SPIRIT SOUL stalked the early pace from a two path stance, swung to three wide near the quarter pole, was on even terms at
upper stretch, locked into a stretch duel, then was outnodded at wire and forced to settle for place. CONFESS pressed the early pace from a two path
stance, rated inside and on even terms at upper stretch, but was outfinished by top pair in final furlong. TAPPED OUT flashed early speed and led the field
through opening half from an inside stance before giving way to late charging rivals. SERBIAN SAILOR finished evenly after settling into second flight and
saving ground. BACKGATE BELLE travelled widest of all around the first turn then improved placing with late interest. MOSH PIT came up empty in the
homestretch after giving chase from between foes in early stages and rating three widenear the three sixteenths pole. EXCLAIM lacked a need response to
urging in closing strides after being unhurried in early going. DOUBLE PRIORITY travelled three wide around the first hook before tiring in the late going.
TIZ MANDATE stood still at break and never left gate.

Footnotes
BIEN JOUE stalked the pacesetting duo from a two path pose, angled to three wide entering the final bend, was two wide at upper stretch, and finished
under a stiff drive for the score. DREWSILLA loomed off the heels of the pacesetters through the opening half, angled out to three wide in the final bend,
then earned the place with a strong late kick. MO BLING hustled from outset and set the pace in tandem as the inner rival, was on even terms eat upper
stretch, but failed to fend off the top pair in the homestretch. BAD GAL RIRI rallied along the rail to improve placing after being unhurried in the early stages.
SHE'S TAKIN OVER travelled wide through the opening bend, losing ground to front runners, then gained mildly in the late going to improve placing. I'D BE
RICH saved ground to no avail. A STONE RUNNER retreated steadily after flashing early speed and setting the pace in unison from a two path position.
QUEEN OF THE MOON shoed reserve through the opening half while saving ground before tiring in the late stages. WHISKEY TO WINE lacked a serious
bid after a three wide journey.

Footnotes
MIKE J rushed from outset and set the pace in unison from a two path stance, had a slight advantage at upper stretch, then drew off from all challengers in
final furlong. CYPRIANO established a ground saving stance shortly after the start, was urged at upper stretch and responded to get up for the place. NO
PEDIGREE flashed early speed and set the early pace in tandem as the inner rival, was alone in second at the eighth pole, but was caught in final stride for
the place honors. FIFTEEN LOVE BACK rallied along the rail to improve placing after being unhurried in early strides and trailing the field along the
backstretch. TEXAS TITAN rated back and travelled widest around the bend before passing tiring foes in final furlong. MISTS OF TIME trekked three wide
along the backstretch, closed gap on leaders through the turn, then faded in late stages. COACH KENNY settled into mid pack and gave chase to front
running duo from between rivals before tiring in the closing strides.

Footnotes
THE GREEN MO'STER hustled away from the start and set the pace in tandem as the inner rival, locked into a stretch duel at head of stretch and won the
bob at the wire for the score. JOHNNYSJOURNEY established a two path position shortly after the start, set the pace in unison, locked into a stretch duel,
but was outnodded at wire. SOURNOIS settled along the inside shortly after the start, just behind pacesetting duo and in the second flight, saved ground
around final bend, and won the stretch duel for show honors but was unable to run down top pair. MORHAWK lacked a needed rally after stalking the pace
from a three path pose and rating in the second flight. HAWKWOOD was gaining on leaders at finish to end a three path journey. LEMON KICK came up
empty after being unhurried through opening half and swinging wide at upper stretch. ITS A CITY DAY showed reserve in the early going, rated three wide
at upper stretch, and gained mildly in final furlong. DUE APEAL settled into mid pack and trekked the three path through the opening half before weakening
in closing strides. MR B QUIET rated mid pack from through opening half before fading rapidly in homestretch.
