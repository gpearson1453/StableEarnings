settle, had a mild late rally in the five path. SERGER bobbled at the start then failed to menace. LADY JASPER passed tiring rivals. TWENTY FOUR

Footnotes
I RECALL advanced along the rail nearing the first turn, angled out around the leader brushing SALLY STRONG at the seven eighths pole, made the lead
two wide before a half, set the balance of the pace and wore down rivals in a game effort. R THREE ANGELS broke in front, set the pace along the rail
through the first turn, dropped back a bit then came on again along the inside through the stretch and just missed. CANDLELIGHT HOURS never far back,
finished with good courage in the five path. SALLY STRONG away alertly, was brushed entering the clubhouse turn, stalked the pace and went evenly.
BALLROOM BLITZ close up from the start, loomed boldly three wide into the far turn, remained a sharp threat until deep stretch then was outfinished.
SHE'S CRAFTY was no threat. CALI DREAM failed to menace. HIGH FIRE trailed. PERFECTINGTHEVIEW was through after a half.

Footnotes
I WANNA WIN chased the pace three then two wide, made the lead near the seven sixteenths pole, quickly drew away from his field the widened through
the stretch under strong handling to win as much the best. FOREWARNED unhurried early, closed willingly four wide in the five path into the stretch and
finished well clear for second. SAMMY'S SMILE allowed to settle, found his best stride late four wide between horses. RAVEN MOON slow early, closed
some ground late six wide. OVER ICCE moved up three wide on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. UPTOWN was no factor. WICKED WARRIOR
offered a mild bid two wide on the far turn then came up empty. WOLFINE bobbled at the start, prompted the pace two wide for six furlongs then gave way.
FIRSTHAND JUSTICE set a pressured pace along the inside for nine sixteenths of a mile then was used up. TEAM HUCKY trailed, lost contact with his field
in upper stretch and was eased to the wire.
