Footnotes
FULL OF LUCK (CHI) threw his head at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to take the lead into the first turn, set moderate fractions while well
handled through the second turn, felt late pressure from WINE AND WHISKY but determinedly dug in under firm urging to prevail. WINE AND WHISKY was
a bit keen early on, settled entering the backstretch run and rated off of the moderate pace, made a two wide bid into the drive and came within aim nearing
mid-stretch, could not get by the game winner in the final sixteenth and was denied for the win while besting the rest. DEALERS HAND stalked the pace
moderate pace outside of rivals, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way late. AUTISMS WORLD broke in at the start and was off a step slowly, was
forwardly placed through the backstretch run, could not keep pace on the second turn and weakened in the stretch run.

HE BE MOJO RISIN tracked the early pace, steadied off of heels into the turn, rallied four wide at the head of the lane, closed with a rush through the final
sixteenth and was up in the final strides to prevail. THAT'S BIND BABE was hustled leaving the break and contested the early pace, took back into the turn,
mounted a two wide bid nearing the quarter marker, took command into the drive, was all out in the final sixteenth while on the left lead and was nailed on
the line for the win, while besting the rest. DRUMADOON chased the early pace, lost ground three wide on the turn, was outkicked in the drive but stayed on
to secure third. TIME IS GONE broke alertly and showed early speed to the turn, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, could not hold off THAT'S
BIND BABE in upper stretch and yielded in the final stages.

Footnotes
HARBOR'S ROSE took back off of the decent early pace, advanced outside of rivals on the turn, headed HARD TO FOOL nearing the eighth pole, dueled
with that rival through the lane and edged away in the final sixteenth. HARD TO FOOL was sent to contest the early pace, shook free from a dueling rival
midway through the turn and took command into the drive, was headed by HARBOR'S ROSE nearing the eighth pole, dueled with that rival to the final
sixteenth but could not keep pace late and was second best. RIVIERA SUNRISE chased the decent early pace from a ground saving path, gained ground
nearing the furlong marker, could not muster the needed late response but was well clear of the rest for third. BEAUTYINTHEBEAST broke alertly and
showed early speed, contested the decent pace with HARD TO FOOL to the turn, did not corner well and drifted out through the turn, lost position nearing
the top of the lane and gave way late. ITALIAN LOVE SONG bobbled at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed, came three wide to the quarter
marker and was not a factor.

CIRCLE OF ROYALTY broke alertly, took back off of the early pace, confronted UNUSUAL BREEZE nearing the quarter marker, overtook that rival in upper
stretch, drew clear in mid-stretch and was kept to task at the end. SEENEVA THE CAT tracked the early pace, improved position on the turn while saving
ground, ran evenly to mid-stretch and could not make up ground on the winner in the final stages but was best of the rest. QUITCHERSNIVELIN bobbled at
the start and was off slowly, chased from the rear through the turn and passed tiring rivals for third in the stretch. WARNING SOUND chased the pace,
gained ground nearing the furlong marker but could not find the needed late response. UNUSUAL BREEZE was hustled to the early lead, set the pace to
the quarter marker, was overhauled by the winner leaving the turn, the rider lost his crop at the top of the stretch and came up empty in the late going.

CLASS CODE was well placed while rating off of the early pace, gained ground while along the rail on the second turn, tipped out leaving the quarter marker
to go two wide into the drive, advanced in mid-stretch, was put to firm left-handed urging in the final sixteenth and reeled in the runner-up in the final strides
to prevail. SAY IT WITH ROSES was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was prompted into the far turn by ROSE
PRINCESS, shook free of that rival in upper stretch, was set down for the drive, was all out under pressure from CLASS CODE in the final sixteenth and
was nailed on the line for the win, while well clear of the rest for second. DR WYSONG stalked the early pace, jumped a bare patch entering the first turn
and lost position into the backstretch run, lost ground into the far turn and lacked a response in the stretch run. ROSE PRINCESS settled three wide just off
of the early pace, made a middle move to vie for the lead nearing the half-mile marker, tracked the leader to the quarter pole, lost ground in upper stretch
and gave way in the final stages.

QUEEN OF LOVE broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions while prompted through the second turn, held rivals at bay through
the stretch run, was put to firm left-handed urging in the final sixteenth and edged away at the end. DEL MAR FLASH stumbled at the start and was off a
step slowly, was forwardly placed while four wide on the first turn, tracked the moderate pace to the second turn, could not make up ground on the winner in
the drive but held second at the end. ALESHA was shuffled back at the start and was off a bit slowly, saved all of the ground while rating just off of the pace,
rallied in the final furlong and just missed for second while securing third. SILK ROAD SALLY raced close to the early pace, lost ground on the backstretch
run, came in tight and lacked room nearing the quarter marker, found room in upper stretch and was outfinished in the drive, while just being edged out for
the minor awards. FIRE DIAMONDS settled just off of the pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, came three then four wide to the quarter
marker and could not muster a late rally.

DESERT DUDE stalked the early pace three wide on the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, was roused three wide nearing the
quarter marker, confronted AMERICA GREAT in upper stretch, battled with that foe to mid-stretch and drew clear in the final stages. AMERICA GREAT
raced close to the early pace and tracked the pacesetter through the backstretch run, advanced on SPEEDY TOM nearing the quarter marker, was
confronted by DESERT DUDE in upper stretch, met that bid to mid-stretch but could not keep pace late and was outfinished, while holding safely for
second. KODIACTION was crowded at the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried while not far back in the early stages, gained ground three then four
wide nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in the drive but stayed on to be an easy third. COOLCROSS hopped at the start then bumped
KODIACTION leaving the break, recovered to stalk the pace from a rail position, gained ground into the second turn but could not sustain that run and gave
way in the final stages. SPEEDY TOM broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, came under
pressure on the second turn, could not hold off AMERICA GREAT leaving the quarter marker and tired in the drive.

LOTSA PEPPER broke alertly and was engaged soon after the break by REDSTWIRLINGDANCER and dueled through the early going with that rival,
shook free entering the turn and drew to a clear lead nearing the quarter marker, extended the lead nearing mid-stretch, was tiring in the final sixteenth but
held safely at the end to prevail. FAIRY TALE BLISS lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, made a bold late rally through the final furlong, was
not able to reel in the winner in the end but was up for second in the final strides. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU chased the early pace, came in tight entering the
turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth and held for third at the end. NAVY QUEEN tracked the moderate early pace, gained
ground three wide on the turn, improved position in upper stretch but lacked the needed late response in the final furlong and was edged for the minor
awards. REDSTWIRLINGDANCER was sent to dispute the early pace, lost ground to LOTSA PEPPER into the turn and through the bend, dropped back in
upper stretch and did not offer a late response.
