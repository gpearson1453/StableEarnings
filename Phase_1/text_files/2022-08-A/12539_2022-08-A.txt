hustled from the eight path into the stretch, and improved down the center. INDIAN SPRINGS tracked in the three path, was ridden from the three path into
the stetch, and gained late. RIVER STONES was unhurried while saving ground but never threatened. TRIPLE CHROME set the pace off the rail but faded

Footnotes
DEER DISTRICT bumped with Crafty King at the start, prompted the pace two wide, made a bid two wide at the top of the top lane, took the lead in the final
furlong, and just held on. HARD TO COME BY stalked two wide, was driven along while tipping out to the four path into the stretch, rallied late but just
missed to place. BLUFF CITY set the pace, was cued from inside into the lane, but yielded late to show. SHERLOCK'S JEWEL sat the pocket, was hustled
from inside into the stretch, but finished evenly. FORTUNE rated from the three path, was ridden two wide into the stretch, but was one paced. CRAFTY
KING bumped with DEER DISTRICT at the start, was well back and inside, was coaxed while saving ground around the far turn, but flattened. TRAFFIC
MASTER trailed from the three path, was driven along from the five path into the stretch, but never factored. MR BINGO tracked from the three path but
never threatened. THUNDERIAN was well back inside and no menace.

Footnotes
STUD LOVIN led from the two path, opened up into the stretch and drew clear. MERAJ pressed from the three path, was ridden in the three path heading
into the stretch, and ran on for place. BEN DREAMING was unhurried from inside, was ridden out to the seven path into the stretch, and improved for show.
MEMPHIS PHAROAH chased inside, steadied into the turn, was cued from the six path into the stretch, but finished evenly. BIRTHDAY MUNNINGS
prompted the pace while three wide, was coaxed from the four path into the stretch, but faded. BLAMETHEGOODTIMES tracked in the three path, was
driven from the five path into the stretch, but flattened. LAST COOKIE was slow into stride and trailed, floated into the six path into the stretch, but was
never a threat. HARDY CHOICE rated in the four path, was cued from the two path at the top of the lane, but was no menace. BARRY'S MUSIC raced from
well back in the two path but was empty into the lane.

HUNTER JOHN set the pace, was coaxed from the two path into the stretch, and held on gamely. MUMAYAZ raced in midpack between foes, tipped out
five wide into the stretch, and rallied for place. SWITZER stalked from inside, saved ground into the stretch, and kept on for show. TWIRLING ROSES
pressed between foes, was in the three path going into the stretch, was squeezed passing the eighth pole, but kept on. OF THE MOMENT chased two wide,
was shuffled back into the turn, was coaxed from the rail into the stretch, steadied near the eighth pole and hit the rail, but finished evenly. KENNESAW
prompted the pace three wide, was ridden four wide into the stretch, but flattened. SPEND BENJAMINS was unhurried from the four path but never
threatened. STELLAR TAP was well back in the five path and never a factor. MY CRAZY NEIGHBOR rated in the three path but was done early. AN
OBJECTION WAS LODGED AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF NUMBER ONE TWIRLING ROSES BY THE JOCKEY OF NUMBER FOUR OF THE MOMENT
FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE EIGHTH POLE BUT THERE WAS NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
ENCOURAGE tracked three wide, made a sweeping bid four wide into the stretch, and just got up late. BLUE DEVIL pressed inside, led from the three path
into the stretch and ran on but was caught late to place. SILVER BLUR stalked inside, was roused from the two path into the stretch, and kept on for show.
LEVITY tracked three wide, was ridden three wide into the stretch, but finished evenly. FAITH RUNNER raced in midpack while two wide, was driven from
the three path into the stretch, but flattened. PREDOMINATE trailed from inside and never threatened. HABITUS broke out and bumped with SPUNS SON,
chased inside but was no menace. SPUNS SON was bumped by HABITUS at the start, rated in the three path but was empty into the stretch. MUCHO
MOJO set the pace two wide but backed out around the far turn. GET THROUGH was well back in the three path but was pulled up and walked off. THERE
WAS AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE JOCKEY OF THE NINE HORSE AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH BUT IT
WAS DISALLOWED.
