Footnotes
IM JUST KIDDIN tracked from midpack in the three path into the turn, tipped out to the four path turning for home, rallied in pursuit of HIGHWAY HARMONY
through midstretch, ranged up alongside entering the final sixteenth, inconsequentially jumped a set of leftover gate tracks while flopping back to her left
lead soon after, but gained an advantage while doing so, and edged clear. HIGHWAY HARMONY was brushed and mildly pushed inwardly by an outer foe
while breaking on top, forged a clear advantage leaving the half mile pole, set an unencumbered pace in the path around the turn, inched further away
entering the lane, held sway from an outer rallying IM JUST KIDDIN through midstretch, but flopped back to his left lead entering the final sixteenth, and was
worn down shortly after. THREE UNIONS raced forwardly along the inside, backed off to stalk the leader at the half mile pole, but required urging to
maintain that position around the turn, then kept on through the lane, and held show late. IRISH EMPRESS broke a step slowly before subtly shying from an
outer foe at the start, trailed along the inside around the turn, shifted five wide and outside of rivals in midstretch, and stayed on to miss reaching show late.
NICE 'N SPICY broke slowly before taking up from tight quarters at the start, tracked while towards the rear two wide, took the turn in the two to three path,
tipped to the four path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. NEVER PERSONAL brushed an inner foe at the start, stalked outside of the leader and from the
three path around the turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
RUN UP THE SCORE was sent hard from the gate, leaned on a foe while going to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way while
inside of a rival down the backstretch, vied in the two path while still inside of an opponent on the far turn, was asked coming to the five-sixteenths then
roused for more shortly thereafter, shook clear into upper stretch, extended the advantage under a left-handed crop into the final furlong, was given one final
pop of a left-handed crop while widening outside the sixteenth-pole, had the rider put the crop away at that point then was placed under a strong hand-ride
to the wire while much the best. AWESOME ALLY VEE settled inside around the first turn, was reserved under some restraint down the backstretch, moved
from the rail to the two path under urging on the far turn, was driven hard into upper stretch and finished willingly for the place while no match for the winner.
HONEYCOMB had her saddle adjusted behind the gate, was hustled from the start, went four wide around the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside,
chased in the four path around the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and weakened but narrowly earned the show. POUT leaned on the
winner in the early going, went three wide around the opening bend, prompted the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the three path on the far turn,
came out while dropping back at the three-sixteenths then was corrected by the rider and tired. REGINA was hustled from the gate, came in after the start
and bumped hard with DOLCE SERA, remained out five wide around the opening bend, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the five-eighths
then moved closer, went two then three wide under strong encouragement around the final turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. DOLCE SERA was bumped hard by REGINA after the start, went three then two wide around the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped from the
two path to the rail on the far turn and faltered then coasted home under protection in the final furlong.

Footnotes
WUDDA U THINK NOW pressed outside of the pace-setter while in the three path around the turn, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch,
sustained his chase to inch closer again entering the final furlong, produced a re-bid as the leader tired shortly after, gained an advantage a sixteenth from
home, and edged clear. REGGAE MUSIC MAN broke a step slowly before nudging an inner rival's hind quarters, trailed the field in the four to three path
into the turn, swung to the five path while picking up stride in upper stretch, changed leads entering the final furlong causing an acceleration, and rallied to
reach place at the wire. SAINT SELBY set the pace in the two path while feeling outer pressure from WUDDA U THINK NOW, shook clear of that foe in
upper stretch, but began to tire passing the furlong grounds, met that foe's re-bid shortly after, gave in at the sixteenth pole, than was nailed at the wire for
place. NY TRAFFIC stalked outside of the top pair while in the four path around the turn, but failed to keep pace with them entering the lane, got floated
wider in upper stretch by an inner REGGAE MUSIC MAN, and failed to menace thereafter. MY BOY TATE took a mild brush to his hind quarters leaving the
gates, chased along the inside under steady urging, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
TAPPLE CIDER bumped with a rival at the start, moved in down the initial straightaway, made her way to the rail into the first turn, settled comfortably on
the inside, came off the rail late on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch then rallied on the outside and closed strongly to get up late. LATEST
EDITION was taken in hand early then rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, got through along the rail when that foe
lugged out into the stretch, came through to take the lead at the three-sixteenths, shook clear while put to a right-handed crop into the final furlong, led into
the final yards but was caught while clear for the place. OAK LOVES A FIGHT settled towards the rear on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, was
roused in the two path into the stretch, gained into the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. LOLLYGAG broke out and bumped with a foe, settled
off the rail, was asked while two then three wide on the far turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. QUEEN OF LIES went to the front
then was taken in hand, traveled around the first turn in the two path, showed the way under a snug hold, vied inside under extra left-rein pressure on the far
turn, spun into the two path entering the stretch then was asked, lost the advantage at the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and tired.
JANNIE MAE was hustled from the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn,
dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and capitulated. MUCHO MAMA MIA broke out and was last to commence, angled in at the rear, rounded the
first turn in the two path, was unhurried at the back, went three then four wide around the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
FALSE HOPE was reserved off the pace in the two path, shifted three wide while roused at the quarter-pole and came up empty. QUIET TYPE went three
wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the seven-sixteenths, raced three wide around the far turn, lugged inward in upper
stretch and was no factor. KAY TEE GAL was hustled from the gate, went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked with a
half-mile to run, dropped back three then four wide on the far turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
ELOQUIST was awkward and a bit slow into stride causing him to trail crossing the wire for the first time, gained to midpack entering the first turn, slipped
inside of rivals leaving the seven furlong pole to bid for the lead entering the backstretch, gained an advantage at the three quarter pole, showed the way
from a pair of pressing rivals around the far turn, met KHAFRE's bid turning for home, swiftly repelled that rival in upper stretch, and firmly held sway
through the final furlong. KHAFRE stalked outside of the leader while kept in the five path by that foe around the far turn, took the far turn in the four path
while pressing the top pair, bid outside of ELOQUIST turning for home, vied entering the lane, but was turned away in upper stretch, then sustained his
chase through the final furlong to prove second best. I AM THE LAW stalked in the the two path, shifted outside of the leading trio turning for home, got
floated to the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on to secure a minor share. SOUTHERN PASSAGE settled towards the rear along the inside early on,
was urged along while still towards the back into the far turn, shifted to the four path around that bend before fanning the seven path in upper stretch, and
moved up outside of rivals. RED REVOLUTION shifted out early on while forging to the front soon after the start, showed the way in the four path around the
first bend before meeting ELOQUIST's rail challenge nearing the backstretch, got headed at the three quarter pole, pressed down the backstretch, then from
the three path while between horses around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with them at the quarter pole, shifted out entering the lane, but further
weakened. COMMANDER COMPTON laid off of the pace two wide and between horses while under steady urging around the first turn, and failed to factor.
ZUZUDINI raced at the rear in the three path, improved down the backstretch, but was urged to gain in the three path around the far turn, failed to respond
before shifting inwardly in upper stretch, and failed to menace. EAGLE IN LOVE broke a bit slowly at the start, settled off of the pace in the three to five
path, but was done early, and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
BAHAMIAN CLUB (IRE) stalked along the inside, received an irrelevant bump from her stablemate at the half mile pole, patiently awaited racing room from
the pocket around the far turn, slipped inside of the leader in upper stretch after that one vacated the rail, forged a narrow advantage at the furlong grounds,
sparred gallantly through the final furlong as her outer counterpart fought on, then brushed with that foe nearing the wire before prevailing in a tight photo.
DIAMOND HANDS set the pace along the inside, shifted off of the hedge entering the lane, met BAHAMIAN CLUB (IRE)'s rail challenge shortly after,
battled on after getting headed at the furlong grounds, regained even terms with her inner counterpart in the final sixteenth, but exchanged a brush with that
one nearing the wire, and just missed. LINDA'S GIFT trailed in the two path around both turns, shifted six wide in midstretch, and rallied outside of foes to
reach show approaching the wire. GAL IN A RUSH saved ground off of the pace, but came under urging around the far turn, and lacked a true response
while chasing along the rail through the lane. AL QAHIRA tracked two wide and between horses, decisively moved forward entering the backstretch to press
the pace at the five furlong pole, sustained that position while being floated three wide entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with the top pair in upper
stretch, then lost show in the late stages, and faltered. SPICER tracked three wide, tucked two wide while just behind the leaders, bumped her inner
stablemate in the process, was called upon for run turning for home, but lacked a rally, and tired through the final furlong. BRAVO KITTEN leaned into the
outer part of the gate at the start, saved ground while reserved off of the pace, split foes two wide turning for home while attempting to launch a rally, shifted
five wide in upper stretch, but failed to sustain a bid. STORM KISS broke a bit outwardly at the start, stalked three wide while in the four path around the first
turn, took the far turn in the three path while outside of the top pair, but weakened entering the lane. SWIFT ACTION brushed with rivals on both sides after
breaking half a beat slowly, then laid off of the pace in the three path and never got involved.

Footnotes
BANKIT saved ground while taking in hand on the first turn, moved out early on the backstretch, settled comfortably off the pace, was roused while three
then four wide on the far turn, commenced a rally outside the quarter-pole, floated six then seven wide into upper stretch, angled in while making a bid
coming to the eighth-pole, dueled outside of the runner-up while drifting inward in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. SEA FOAM
was sent hard from the start, dropped from four to three wide around the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch with some company to his outside,
vied in the two path on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch under pressure, was challenged by the winner
nearing the eighth-pole, dueled gamely inside that foe in the final furlong and was denied while clear for the place. BROOKLYN STRONG went around the
first turn in the two path, moved out early on the backstretch, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the seven-sixteenths, went four then five wide
around the far turn and lacked the needed kick while just able to get the show. MARKET ALERT went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the
outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch under a drive then drifted out some, moved out after dropping back into
the final furlong and weakened then just lost the show. THREE JOKERS brushed with a foe early, dropped from the three path to the rail on the first turn,
settled at the rear, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, saved ground early on the far turn, angled three wide approaching the five-sixteenths,
dropped to the two path under a drive into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. TIERGAN brushed with a foe early, went four wide around the
opening bend, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the final turn and failed to respond. THERISASTORMBREWIN dropped from the two path to
the rail on the first turn, was well placed down the backstretch, passed the nine-sixteenths under urging, came up empty along the rail on the far turn and
faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

SMOKIN' HOT KITTY broke a bit inwardly at the start, tracked in midpack in the two path, shifted four wide for clear sailing entering the lane, rallied in
pursuit of a clear ELI DANCER in the final furlong, ranged up to her inside the final sixteenth, and edged an advantage approaching the wire. ELI DANCER
bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked two wide as the leader's closest pursuer, bid for the lead entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch, but
shifted outwardly before meeting SMOKIN' HOT KITTY's bid in the final sixteenth, and failed to hold sway. GALLEY HEAD loaded rider-less without
incident, broke awkwardly while off a step slowly, moved forward to chase three wide, gained place in upper stretch while chasing a clear ELI DANCER, but
required rider correction against lugging in in midstretch, got outkicked for place by an outer rival leaving the furlong grounds, and kept on to secure show.
ACE UP HER SLEEVE tracked in midpack in the three path, shifted five wide entering the lane, and stayed on mildly. COOLCATSNKITTENS stalked along
the inside, searched for racing room whilst in the two path just behind the leaders entering the lane, but only managed to chase after an outer rival got a
jump in upper stretch, and lacked a punch to attempt a bid thereafter. MADDIE'S SURPRISE broke slowly, trailed along the inside around the turn, shifted
out in upper stretch, and moved up. UNKOALAFIED settled off of the pace two wide and between horses, forged ahead of them into the turn before tucking
to the rail at the three furlong pole, shifted out turning for home, but checked when the eventual winner took away her path entering the lane, shifted in
shortly after, and lacked a rally. SARAH'S SPLENDOR bumped with an inner foe at the start, sat reserved along the inside while far back, came into the
lane in the three path, but was carried in by an outer UNKOALAFIED in upper stretch, and failed to menace. LOLA LOLA cleared off at the half mile pole
before tucking to the two path, showed the way around the bend, but was headed at the quarter pole, and stopped shortly after. ONE JOURNEY was
restless and antsy in the paddock, loaded rider-less, then raced far back in the three to four path, and got outrun.

Footnotes
THEODORA GRACE was away awkwardly then taken in hand early, raced under vigorous restraint while rank along the rail through the first turn, was rated
off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, came out for room and brushed with a foe in upper stretch, chased into the final
furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole and got up under strong handling. WHATLOVELOOKSLIKE was keen under stout restraint into the first turn,
went three wide on that bend, settled off the pace, saved ground for most of the far turn then moved to the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch,
brushed with a foe in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths, rallied into the final furlong, closed well to make a bid late and just missed while able to get the
place. WATERVILLE went two to three wide around the opening bend, settled on the outside, traveled four wide while roused on the far turn, was corrected
with a tug of the right-rein while leaning inward in upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong and closed well to just miss while narrowly able to get the show.
DUFRESNE moved in while going to the front, showed the way under a snug hold on the inside, was given her cue leaving the backstretch, responded well
when put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop at the furlong marker, led to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken and just
missed the trifecta. FIST FULL OF DICE was rank against the hedge into the first turn, saved ground under a very snug hold around that bend, was
reserved on the inside, came under urging outside the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch in the two path, chased into the final furlong, raced behind traffic
into the final sixteenth then tipped out a path and finished willingly but missed the superfecta. MASTEROF THE TUNES was taken up while carried six wide
into the first turn then dropped to the four path, settled off the pace, was asked while two then three wide around the far turn, brushed with a foe in the four
path in upper stretch and improved position. SHE'S A MIA angled in while placed under a tight hold early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was
reserved near the back, traveled in the two path on the far turn, was roused late on that bend, dropped to the hedge and cut the corner into the stretch,
gained in some traffic into the final furlong, waited and steadied while stymied in the final furlong, altered out looking for room outside the sixteenth-pole,
continued stymied to the wire and lost any chance. LOOKIN TO FLY broke a bit awkwardly, dropped back along the hedge early, settled on the inside, was
roused on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and finished with late energy. SINFULLY SWEET came away in good order, raced towards the front
down the initial straightaway, bumped with a rival into the first turn, moved from the three path to the two path around that bend, stalked outside down the
backstretch, was asked in the two path on the far turn, brushed with a foe around the three-sixteenths, chased the leader under a drive into the final
sixteenth and was out-kicked. CLASSIC LYNNE established a forward position early, bumped with a foe while four wide into the first turn then dropped to
the three path, was rated just off the pace, came under urging in the three path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and capitulated. TEMPERMENTAL
broke out at the start, was taken up while carried seven wide into the first turn, dropped to the five path later on that bend, was reserved on the outside,
came under urging in the four path on the far turn, was carried inward in upper stretch and was no factor. CANDY MONET was very rank under restraint
early, bore out seven wide into the first turn and was taken up, dropped to the six path later on that bend, settled towards the rear, went four wide on the far
turn, came six wide into the stretch then drifted in and failed to respond.
