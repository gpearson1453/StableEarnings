RIDICULOUS raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn, rallied on the rail at the furlong marker, dug in gamely in the final sixteenth and was going
best late to prevail. MUGSY MALONE raced three wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, rallied four wide into the lane, closed steadily outside
and got up for second at the wire. CAJUN MANDATE set the pace racing with a clear lead, dug in between rivals in midstretch, then continued gamely in the
two path to the finish. ISLE OF SKYE stalked the pacesetter, chased on the turn, rallied entering the stretch, dug in and was outkicked. I'M OVER U trailed
the field, advanced three wide on the turn, came wide and lacked a rally. TEMPESTUOUS raced between foes early on, chased on the turn and had no
rally.
