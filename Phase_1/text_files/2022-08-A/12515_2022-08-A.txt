Footnotes
THISLADYIS THE LAW tracked the pace rating, moved up inside through the second turn to gain a short lead, then came again in the late going, edged
ahead and held under steady pressure. STARSHIP BELMONT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second
turn, came again in the lane to edged ahead, then was no match for the winner late, while clearly best of the rest. SHE NASTY unhurried in the early going,
moved up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, then could not gain the final furlong and held the show. JEAN V'S
LEGACY allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, came widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed the show.
HOT HEELS well placed and between rivals, angled in and lost some ground through the second turn, came through inside into the stretch and weakened
further. TAKE TO THE SKIES well placed and outside, held position two and three wide through the second turn, then faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
INDIAN SPIDEROO sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. ELSA'S
ROCKET tracked the pace, steadied while boxed through the second turn, angled five wide into the stretch when clear and closed well for the place. ZORA
rated inside, angled four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, weakened late and held the show. ANA L well placed and outside, held
position on the two path through the second turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, then weakened and held a share. LUNA T dropped back in the early
going, came widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. KEYSTONE WARRIOR unhurried in the early going, gained position into the second turn, lost
some ground three wide through the turn, then had no stretch rally and finished on equal terms with BELLA'S CUPID. BELLA'S CUPID allowed to settle,
saved ground through the turns, came through on the two path into the stretch, then could not gain and finished on equal terms with KEYSTONE
WARRIOR. FUNNEE well placed, steadily lost ground.

LOOKING FOR LOVE sent from the gate, sprinted clear quickly, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. RUNAWAY
PHYLLIS tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled outside the leader into the stretch, then could not gain on that one and held the place.
CANCAN SAREE never far back, moved up three and four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted in and had a mild late gain.
PIVOTAL WOMAN (FR) allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out the final furlong and missed the
show. TRUDIAN'S PROMISE unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and closed willingly.
DONTLOSETHATNUMBER well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, then drifted out and
faded. POOKIELICIOUS was no factor.

Footnotes
HEATHER'S GOLD set a pressure pace inside, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and lasted under steady pressure. WAPITI WAY unhurried early,
saved ground through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, dueled with JARETH, edged ahead of that one while gaining on the leader and missed.
JARETH never far back, looped up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, dueled with a rival and lacked the needed late kick.
SAMURAI ZIP well placed and outside, gained a striking position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and evened out.
BLUE SKY'S ABOVE chased the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong.
TAPSOLUTION ran evenly. FOX ROX vied for the early lead on the outside and faded into the stretch.

leader at the furlong marker, then could not sustain the bid and held the place. LA REINA DEL NORTE led in the early going, rated back, angled in to save
ground through the turn, came through inside and weakened. ULTIMATE BARONESS allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside
of rivals into the stretch, angled out at the furlong marker for clear racing room and flattened out. ITALIAN TWIN mid pack, looped three and four wide
through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. STRAIGHT MADNESS ]ran evenly, widest.

MORE RANSOM set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. SPARKLING WATER allowed to settle,
moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, then closed well late for the place. GEARED UP unhurried in the early
going, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, was boxed, waited, then followed SPARKLING WATERS path and
edged up for the show in the final strides. VACCINA stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader
into the stretch, then weakened and was outfinished for the show. ALATION well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that
path into the lane and weakened late. HIDDEN MEDAL mid pack, held position four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and weakened.
TUDOX I DON'T BRAG tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and faded the final furlong.
BLUEBERRY PIE was never involved.
