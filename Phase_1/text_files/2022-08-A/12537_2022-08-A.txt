Footnotes
COURT SNORT tracked the pace from inside, saved ground through the far turn, steered outside the top pair in the stretch and drove clear late. LOYAL TO
A FAULT stalked in the two path, closest in pursuit into and around the far turn, took aim two wide into the stretch, challenged from outside in upper stretch,
took over midstretch but could not offer any resistance to the winner in the final sixteenth. WARREN'S PARADICE broke a step slow and brushed with inner
rival, moved to the inside trailing the field, looked to advance but lacked room from the rail at the quarter pole, tipped out and bumped rival at the top of the
lane, moved out further in the lane and finished with a late run. CHERRY CHAOS took control early from inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, showed
the way into the drive, challenged in upper stretch and clung to a short lead at the eighth pole, was overtaken shortly after and flattened to fourth. SUE
GENEROUS rank in the early stages while chasing from off the rail, took the second turn two wide, got bumped by WARREN'S PARADICE at the top of the
stretch and weakened. FOREST ACCLAMATION broke a step slow and brushed outside rival, became rank and pulled early on, had to alter out when
running up on rival early on the first turn, went three then two wide on the far turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
PERFECT CUT raced up close three wide around the first turn, applied pressure midway point three deep, dueled from outside and took a short lead on the
far turn, put away inner rival in upper stretch and held well. SALTO DE TIGRE raced in range while caught four wide on the clubhouse turn, angled to the
two path around the far turn then moved back out and exited the bend four wide, put in a mild late bid but could not reach the winner. STONE'S RIVER got
bumped leaving the gate, showed speed in the two path, took pressure from both sides at the midway point, fought with the winner through the far turn,
failed to keep pace in upper stretch but stayed on to secure the show. FUNKENSTEIN stumbled leaving the gate, stalked in the two path, between rivals on
the backstretch, got put in tight briefly entering the far turn, angled out and raced wide into the stretch and improved position. BIG FLAME broke a step slow,
went three wide into the clubhouse turn then angled down to the rail, took closer order in the middle stages, had to pause and halt his momentum entering
the far turn, tipped off the rail around the bend and lacked a late rally. WILLY THE COBBLER chased wide through the first turn, remained off the rail to the
second bend, moved out and entered the stretch seven wide and was not a factor. COMRADERY (IRE) bumped at the start, coaxed early from inside
chasing the leader, applied a bit of pressure at the half-mile pole, raced in tight inside the leader through the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and
weakened. K P D DAY tracked five wide early, went four wide into the second turn, entered the lane six wide and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SPRING SPINNING unhurried in the early going, traveled in the two path then angled out on the far turn and came four wide into the stretch, tipped out
further in the lane and bested the runner-up in the final sixteenth. CONSTERNATION (IRE) reserved and avoided a shuffle between rivals early, went three
wide around the first turn, coaxed three to four wide on the second bend, got bumped from inside entering the stretch, bid three deep in upper stretch, led
into the final sixteenth but got outkicked by the winner. WORK TO LIVE dueled from inside into the first turn, cleared around the bend, met the challenge
from RVALENTINA into the far turn, fought into the stretch, battled into the furlong grounds then could not kick on with the top pair but churned on to save
the show. RVALENTINA dueled for the lead from outside into the first turn, ceded command and chased the leader around the bend, re-engaged rival with
three furlong remaining, dueled around the far turn and into the stretch, held a narrow advantage entering the final furlong, overtaken midstretch, flattened in
the final sixteenth and got edged for the show. NOBLE HEARTED stalked in the two path then moved inside, waited for room behind the leaders on the far
turn, tipped out and bumped rival and got hemmed in at the three-sixteenths pole, lacked room in the stretch, gained a clear path with a sixteenth left but
was too late. LANDSLID settled on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, lacked room in upper stretch and was ridden out late. ANNA VOLANTE showed
early speed but pulled and was tossing her head about, stalked off the rail then outside a rival, pushed upon on the far turn, got shuffled between runners
past the quarter pole and weakened.

Footnotes
SILVER LIGHTENING bumped both sides at the start, stalked the top trio to the turn, angled outside the leaders and bid four wide leaving the bend, kicked
clear in upper stretch and powered away. OTTER POP pressed the top pair from outside, vied three deep around the bend, led briefly leaving the turn but
was quickly overtaken by SILVER LIGHTENING, was no match for that rival in the lane but kept on to best the rest. SMILING PRINCESS got knocked into
rival and steadied back leaving the gate, chased four wide through the turn and was along for the show. DADDY CLASSY DILL broke a step slow, was
ridden cautiously to the inside of LADY AUDUBON up the backstretch, got by the rival on the turn, continued along the rail to the stretch, tipped out in the
lane and ran on to earn a minor award. DRAMA DIVA dueled for command from inside, vied with rivals around the turn and into the stretch, then gave way.
THE COMRIE RULE took a bumped in the hind quarters at the start, tracked off the rail, angled to the two path on the turn then came three wide into the
stretch and lacked further response. LADY AUDUBON chased in range early then dropped back, traveled in the two path around the bend and came up
empty. SHE'S SO FANCY broke out and bumped rival, went up to duel for the lead from outside then between rivals on the turn, lost touch with the leaders
at the quarter poles and folded. PAYTRICIA stumbled badly and took up at the start, raced wide into the turn, eased into and down the stretch and walked
off.

Footnotes
BRIEFCASE GIRL came in shortly after the start, stalked from inside, tipped out at the top of the stretch, surged to the front just past the eighth pole and
drew off under hand urging. AUTOMAX (IRE) got bumped and lost her path briefly early, chased out of range near the inside, cut the corner into the stretch,
moved out in the lane and rallied to gain the place. IZZY EM got bumped shortly after the start, dropped back early, got blocked behind rivals with a quarter
mile left to run, tipped out then moved back inside in the stretch and came with a mild late rally to earn the show honors. SUGAR SUGAR stalked the top
pair outside a rival, traveled two wide then tipped out at the quarter pole, kept on through the lane and got edged for the show. DECADE OF DREAMS set
the pace under pressure from outside into the turn, disposed of that rival nearing the quarter pole, collared by the winner at the eighth pole and weakened. A
GOOD LAW tracked three deep early, two to three wide on the turn and failed to rally. DREAM A DREAM was off several lengths slow to begin, traveled
along the rail into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, moved out further in the lane and failed to threaten. PELIGROSO pressed the
pace from outside, lost touch with the leader at the quarter pole and weakened. I'M NO BALLERINA broke a step slow, went three wide around the turn and
was not a factor.

Footnotes
MOODY JIM (IRE) unhurried in the early going, went four then three wide around the first turn, steered out leaving the far turn and came five wide into the
stretch, rallied widest and closed fast to edge OPRY in the final moments. OPRY broke a step slow and brushed leaving the gate, tracked from inside and
saved ground to the stretch, launched a rail bid and led briefly late before being bested by the winner. SOUTHERN KING stalked four then three wide on the
first turn, traveled outside foes into the far turn, entered the lane four deep and gained the show. TED took control from the rail early, got pressure from
outside past the seven-sixteenths pole, kicked clear with a quarter mile left to run, led into the final sixteenth and yielded late. RESPECT THE HUSTLE
closest in pursuit in the two path, bid outside past the seven-sixteenths pole, lost touch with the leader at the quarter pole, stayed on through the lane but
lacked the needed late kick. WINNING FACTOR traveled in mid-pack on the inside, waited behind the leaders on the far turn, continued to look for an open
spot in the stretch but never found room. BUENISIMO broke a step slow and brushed rival leaving the gate, chased between then steadied behind a rival on
the first turn, exited the far turn three deep and lacked a rally. JACK SPROUT broke well then settled off the pace three deep, spun four wide into the lane
but lacked a rally. EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER broke slow, got crowded and checked into the first turn then pulled early, raced near the back in the middle stags,
traveled near the inside then two wide into the lane, angled out and failed to threaten. DUBBY DUBBIE rated three then two wide early, traveled between
runners then got boxed in on the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. BOTTLE OF SMOKE got crowded between foes early and dropped back to last,
took a bad step at the half-mile pole and was pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
SUNRISE JOURNEY away quickly and took the lead outside rivals, cleared at the half-mile pole and moved to the two path, challenged from outside into
the turn, responded nicely and moved clear past the five-sixteenths pole, drew away in upper stretch and was kept to task to the wire. THE LITTLE H MAN
lost his path early and dropped back, went three deep into the turn, moved out and came five wide into the stretch and finished well to prove second best.
CREATIVE PEAK chased from inside then crept up inside the leader at the three-eighths pole, lost ground around the turn, churned on through the lane
without making any headway and held the show. NICE GUY CLAY bobbled leaving the gate, got forced in by the winner early, chased off the rail, bid from
outside into the turn, lost contact with the winner past the five-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the lane and flattened to fourth. LIL RICHARDS
BELLO was off slow to begin, chased six wide then five wide on the turn and lacked a rally when called upon. QUICK FINISH was off slow to begin, raced
on the inside near the back, asked right-handed on the turn, angled out in the stretch and improved position. CATEMACO got bumped early then forwardly
placed off the rail up the backstretch, had to pause entering the turn, went two wide into the lane and failed to respond. GOLD RUSH CANDY got forced in
early, tracked five deep exiting the backstretch, left the bend four wide and weakened. FORGIVING SPIRIT got crowded between rivals early, raced a bit
rank tugging the rider along then began to climb, raced off the rail and came five wide into the lane and failed to menace. SEATTLE BREAKOUT shifted in
and bumped early, climbed along in the early stages, came four wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.
