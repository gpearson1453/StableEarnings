HEY NOW set the pace, drew off in the drive and was ridden out. PICK A LANE FRANK was never far back, put in a steady effort, couldn't gain ground and
was no match for the winner. BROTHERLY LOVE was unhurried early, put in an even effort and passed a tiring rival. JOKERIN vied early, stopped on the
turn, was eased and walked off. Hand timed.

Footnotes
MIRACLE OF HOPE pressed the pace while racing outside, challenged for the lead on the turn, assumed command, drew off and extended the lead under
mild urging. PRECIOUS ONE was hustled along, led briefly early, awaited room on the turn, bid and was no match late. SKY HIGH VERONIKA was in tight
entering the turn, fell back, got through along the rail entering the stretch and lacked the needed rally. K P KRYPTON bumped at the start, was slow early
and offered a mild bid to improve position. SNOOZY SUZY broke slowly, advanced outside, went five wide entering the stretch and came up empty. ELLE
VICTOIRE bumped at the start and failed to threaten in an even effort. SHE'S ALL ATTITUDE moved up inside to set the pace, tired on the turn and gave
way. DUTIFUL DAUGHTER had brief speed only. DYNAMIC WOMAN was not a factor. ALEMOON trailed the field. Hand timed.
