Footnotes
STATE OF AFFAIR came away with a forward position leaving the starting area, took jump one a little bit awkwardly, stalked outside while in hand, was
forced out over fences three and five, took the lead coming to fence six, widened the advantage around the third turn, jumped well over fences seven and
eight, responded well under urging on the final turn, came well out into the course into upper stretch and proved much the best under steady urging to the
wire. TAKE PROFIT was reserved off the pace under restraint while jumping okay, moved closer around the second turn and onto the stretch for the first
time, hit fence six then bobbled upon landing and dropped back, began full pursuit of the winner from that point, jumped well over the last two fences, was
hard ridden in the two path around the final turn, came outward into upper stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. BALTIMORE
KID (IRE) loped along towards the rear on the outside while jumping reasonable well, leapt inward over fence four, remained well off the leader through the
final turn and lacked the needed response while along for the show. HURTGEN FOREST went to the front, jumped well over the first two fences, leapt
outward at fences three and five, lost the advantage to the winner coming to fence six, dropped back under urging from that juncture, jumped outward again
over fence seven and tired. SPRING HEELED JIM (IRE) struggled clearing fences two and three, jumped well over fences five and six, raced well off the
pace throughout and failed to respond. GREY GIANT was fractious pre-race, acted-up as the field was sent on its way, refused to depart with the rest of the
contestants while playing around and wheeling, was finally coaxed into beginning his journey about the same time the rest of the field was approaching the
first jump, lagged at the rear while jumping outward, moved out of last briefly between fences five and six, bobbled landing over fence six then dropped to
the rear again and was eased in the stretch then vanned off.

Footnotes
DRINK THE WIND established the front crossing to the two path and placing both KOBE'S LEGACY and READYSEEKGO in tight briefly, showed the way
in hand just off the inside shaking away given a notch to work with through the turn, swung three then two wide into upper stretch placed to brief light
coaxing and went clear to the finish prevailing comfortably at the end. PRINCE OF FENTON coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing
from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while along clear for the place honors. SHARPOON
raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch until tucked to the inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing half a mile from home, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. PAPI ON ICE coaxed from the gate, chased four to five paths off the inside down the
backstretch before tucking four then three wide midway on the turn, angled in to be along the rail just inside the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into
upper stretch and tired. KOBE'S LEGACY stumbled at the start, then got placed in tight between foes when DRINK THE WIND tucked inwards from the
outside, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. READYSEEKGO got steadied after
the start when DRINK THE WIND tucked inwards from the outside, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, lost ground midway
on the turn and was eased up going seven to eight wide into upper stretch, was eased along to the finish, then was reported to have bled.

CONMAN broke in and hit the gate, was bumped soundly on both sides just after the start then taken up, spotted the leader a few lengths, recovered to
track that foe down the backstretch, went two then three wide around the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch, chased outside into the final furlong,
gained into the final sixteenth and got up under strong handling. MAKAR ducked in badly while breaking in front, had the right hand of the rider slide down
the rein making correction more difficult, bothered all his rivals, went clear while the rest of the field tried to recover, controlled the action in the two path
around the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, shied in a touch while put to a right-handed crop at
the furlong marker, was straightened by the rider and put back under a strong hand-ride before switched to a left-handed crop while still in front at the
sixteenth-pole then was caught while clear for the place. ITSALLCOMINTOGETHA broke out and hit the gate, was bumped soundly on both sides shortly
thereafter then bobbled and checked, spotted the leader many lengths, saved ground around the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, moved out under a
drive into the final furlong and finished with good energy for the show. BLUE SOLDIER bumped with a rival at the start then came outward before being
taken up, gave up a few lengths to the leader, raced under restraint while off heels early then settled closer to the two path, was guided around the turn in
about the two path while under a bit of extra left-rein pressure, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response then bumped with a
opponent nearing the wire. GENERAL BANKER was bumped on both sides at the start then taken up, spotted the pacesetter a few lengths, settled in third
position, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was roused while two then three wide around the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to rally then
bumped with a foe nearing the wire. BOSS JIM hesitated at the start then bumped with a foe and checked, spotted the leader many lengths, settled at the
back, went around most of the turn in the two path, shifted four wide inside the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten while
gaining some ground. SORPRESO was bumped hard on both sides at the start then taken up, settled off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn,
was driven five wide into the stretch, drifted in around the sixteenth-pole and failed to respond. KING OF COMEDY was forced in at the start then bumped
with a foe and checked sharply, spotted the leader many lengths, went three wide on the turn, moved to five wide nearing the quarter-pole and was no
factor. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
SIBELIUS coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace from the outside in the three path coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four to five wide
into upper stretch seizing command straightened away, dug in under a drive shaking off MEXICAN WONDER BOY a sixteenth out to edge clear and was
geared down to the finish. MEXICAN WONDER BOY broke out at the start and was corrected, came under coaxing to show the way in hand just off the
inside under increasing pressure from the aforementioned foe to the outside throughout, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and was headed for the front straightened away, dug in running on but was shaken off in the final sixteenth while clear for the place
honors. HIGHER STANDARD got bumped at the start by MONTAUK DADDY, who broke outwards, chased three to four paths off the inside down the
backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and kept on to secure the
show honors. PRIME FACTOR five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch,
weakened. KINETIC SKY coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went three to four wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. MONTAUK DADDY broke out at the start bumping HIGHER STANDARD, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got
coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
INFLATION ADJUSTED was hustled from the gate, jostled with BE THE BOSS early then was taken under a snug hold, went three wide around the
opening bend, was rated on the outside, came under coaxing near the seven-sixteenths then was asked to move up, jostled with BE THE BOSS while
keeping that foe to the inside leaving the backstretch, chased in the two path around the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained to make an
outside bid under a left-handed crop at the furlong marker, took the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and held under steady urging. PARQUETRY was
rated while saving ground, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch, drifted in under a right-handed crop at the furlong marker, gained between foes
into the final sixteenth and finished with good energy for the place. SUPER WICKED CHARM went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was
roused four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch under a drive and finished willingly for the show. TONAL IMPACT hit the gate and was last
to commence, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled near the back, was urged along while saving ground on the far turn, swung four wide into
the stretch and improved position. SKYLANDER went three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, rounded the far turn in the three path, was
given his cue at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick. MOON MISCHIEF was hustled to the front, showed
the way on the inside, was urged along on the far turn, came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, shortened stride into the final furlong, switched to a
left-handed crop while headed outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened. ASSIDUOUSLY (GB) steadied in the three path while between foes early on the
first turn, was reserved towards the rear, rounded the far turn in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive, steadied when
PARQUETRY drifted in at the furlong marker and failed to threaten. BE THE BOSS jostled with INFLATION ADJUSTED early then moved out, traveled
around the first turn in the two path, tracked the leader on the outside, was asked to move up near the seven-sixteenths, jostled again with INFLATION
ADJUSTED while kept in at the three-eighths, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, chased against the rail into the final furlong
and tired. WRITEITONTHEICE saved ground while reserved near the middle of the field, went around the far turn in the two path, shifted three wide into the
stretch then tipped a bit further out and lacked the needed response. B C GLORY DAYS went two to three wide on the turns and was no factor. I FOUND IT
went four wide on the first turn, lagged well back in the field, was urged along in the two path on the final turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and
showed little.

Footnotes
MAPLE LEAF MEL established the front just after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside
through the turn slipping away through the latter portion of the bend, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear in hand and was given a
single cross a furlong out, remained clear to the finish going easy in hand to the wire. SECURITY CODE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on well clear of the rest for the place honors to be along
second best. SPINNING COLORS got bumped at the start by HERE WE GO AGAIN, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
three wide into upper stretch and weakened to the finish while well clear for the show honors. JOEY THE FISH three to four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path placed to coaxing at the nine-sixteenths, went three then two wide through the turn before going four wide into upper
stretch and improved position passing tired rivals in the late stages. BLANCHIMENT broke in at the start and was bumped by HERE WE GO AGAIN after
that rival bounced off SPINNING COLORS, altered out to avoid a solid impact with that rival getting steadied in behind JOEY THE FISH and conceding five
to six lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside down the backstretch, tipped out to the four path with seven-sixteenths to go
under coaxing, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. PEBBLE LANE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. OUR ROSIE DIAMONDS chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, angled in nearing the five-sixteenths and took the inside route into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. HERE WE GO AGAIN broke in at
the start bumping SPINNING COLORS, bounced off that rival outwards getting a glancing blow on BLANCHIMENT before that rival altered outwards,
chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. LOVE MY
CANDY coaxed from the gate, chased four wide down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. BOOK AND CANCEL coaxed from the start, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three
wide through the turn and came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and faltered.

MONTATHAM was bumped lightly in the hindquarters at the start, settled comfortably off the pace, went around most of the turn in the two path then shifted
three wide, swung five wide in front of ON OUR WAY BOYZ at the quarter-pole, shut-off that foe and had him clip his heels, rallied outside under strong
urging and closed fast to get up in the final forty yards. VOCALIZE settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was roused inside the five-sixteenths
then shifted four wide, rallied to the lead outside the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. KING MOONRACER
settled under some urging, moved out leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, paused off heels at the five-sixteenths, swung eight wide into the
stretch then hesitated when a foe to his inside fell at the quarter-pole, gained outside in the final furlong and finished with good energy. FORE HARP was
hustled to the front, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, extended the advantage into upper stretch, lost the lead to the
runner-up outside the furlong marker and was out-kicked. STARRYSTARRYKNIGHT broke a bit awkwardly and was off a step slow, was taken under a tight
hold early, raced under stout restraint while reserved at the rear, saved ground around the turn, shifted three wide over heels coming to the quarter-pole,
checked while lacking room behind horses into upper stretch, altered out for room inside the three-sixteenths and finished with late energy in a tough trip.
COUSIN ANDREW broke out a bit at the start, raced briefly off heels early then came under urging, saved ground on the turn, shifted to the two path outside
the quarter-pole, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. STAINLESS STEEL broke a bit awkwardly, chased the leading duo
on the outside, dropped from the three path to the two path on the turn, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. UNCLE REMI came away in good
order while racing without front shoes, disputed the pace on the outside, dropped back a bit in the three path around the turn, fell further back into upper
stretch and tired. ON OUR WAY BOYZ broke out and brushed the gate then bumped lightly with a foe, moved up on the outside, went four wide on the turn,
was carried six wide at the quarter-pole then shut-off by the winner, clipped heels with that opponent at that point and fell but returned to his feet sans jockey
then was walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE QUARTER-POLE, MONTATHAM WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
FIRST AND PLACED EIGHTH. PLEASE NOTE THAT UNCLE REMI RACED WITHOUT FRONT SHOES

ISOLATE hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside patiently handled through swift splits until roused continuing just off the inside
into upper stretch, then drew off under a drive to prevail. REPO ROCKS coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four
wide through the turn under urging from the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to
secure the place honors clear of the rest. MR PHIL hustled from the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three wide into
upper stretch and weakened in the stretch. SOUTHERN DISTRICT hustled from the gate, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then
three to four wide through the turn under a drive from the three-eighths pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and was outrun. AWESOME GERRY
chased three to four wide just off the pace, suffered an injury at the half mile pole and was put to a protective hold and quickly pulled up being guided to the
outside fence, then got attended to by veterinarian and was euthanized on track. There was a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the incident into the turn prior to
the result standing and the race being declared official.

off the pace, drafted in the two path on the far turn, dropped to the hedge coming to the quarter-pole, bumped with MAJOR SPIN while trying to get out in
upper stretch, waited while kept in behind the leader, came out and bumped solidly with WAR TERMINATOR who came in at the same time outside the
sixteenth-pole, accelerated when clear into the final sixteenth and got up late to prevail. GOLQUIST was hustled to the front, dropped to the hedge into the
first turn, showed the way through sensible fractions, was asked under threat on the far turn, came under the crop in upper stretch, led determinedly into the
final sixteenth but was denied while just able to get the place. FRANK'S ART moved in while placed under tight restraint early, pulled hard on the bit into the
first turn, was reserved while saving ground under a snug hold, moved closer on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path while behind foes,
bumped with TIMBUKTU to get room around the three-sixteenths, rallied in the final furlong and finished well to just miss while able to get the show.
BATTLE SCARS had his saddle adjusted behind the gate, went three wide around the first turn, settled outside but with cover, was roused three wide on the
far turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved position. WAR TERMINATOR became rank under restraint early, went two to three wide around the
first turn, was rated in third position, raced three wide on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive into the final furlong,
came in and bumped solidly with the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished. MR. KRINGLE acted-up at the start and was off slow, spotted
the front a few lengths, went two to three wide at the rear, came four wide into the stretch, was driven between horses at the furlong marker and was no
factor. TIMBUKTU broke out at the start, tugged hard at the bit into the first turn, raced in the two path around that bend, was reserved on the outside but
with cover, came under urging leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the far turn, bumped with a foe in upper stretch and lacked the needed response.
BREADMAN was hustled from the gate, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved near the back, saved ground on the far turn and was no factor.
MAJOR SPIN broke in then was hustled before being taken in hand, moved from the rail to the two path early on the first turn, stalked outside down the
backstretch, was asked between foes in the two path on the far turn, bumped with the winner while keeping that foe inside in upper stretch, dropped back
into the final furlong and capitulated.

then three wide nearing the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to procure the show honors in the late stages.

five-sixteenths, got headed near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. CLUBBING just off the inside in
pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late going.
