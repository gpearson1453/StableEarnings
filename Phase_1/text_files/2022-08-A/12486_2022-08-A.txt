CHARLIE'S PEAK rated close up and between rivals from outset and along backstretch, locked into a stretch duel at upper stretch and kept tot ask in final
furlong for the victory. MOLLYS FLYIN HIGH earned the place with strong late kick and was gaining on leader at finish after settling into mid pack on a three
path journey. LOST WISH settled into second flight, trekked an inside line around the turn, had to alter lanes near the eighth pole, and finished willingly for
the show. BLUEBIRD SING was unhurried aong the backstretch, travelled widest through the bend, and finished with a rush to be closing fast on leaders at
finish. LILLIE DELL retreated rapidly in the final furlong after flashing early speed and setting the early pace from a two path stance. TWN MS MIDSHIP
tucked behind early front runners, saved ground around the hook, and lacked a serious bid. TRULY A ROCKET showed reserve throught he first call,
trekked the two path into upper stretch, then tired in closing strides.

THOUGHTSANDPRAYERS rushed form outset and established a ground saving stance, led the field into and around the bend, then warded off all
challengers for the score. BEAUTIFULANDWILD settled into second flight as the inner rival of two, chased pacesetting duo into and around the turn, and
finished evenly but was unable to run down leader in final furlong. PINTLALA showed reserve and trailed the field along the backstretch, traveled wide into
the homestretch and earned the show with a late rush. NOT ENOUGH BLING chased the pacesetting duo from the second flight, swung to three wide at
upper stretch, then tired in final furlong. SHINING TERRI hustled from outset to set the pace in tandem as the outer rival of two abreast before breaking
stride mid turn and stopping.

GREELEY WENT WEST stalked the pacesetters from an inside stance, was on the heels of front running trio at upper stretch, angled out nearing the eighth
pole and split foes inside the final furlong to rally for the score. MORE ICE forced the early pace from a three wide pose, rated close up at upper stretch,
locked into a stretch duel, then was caught in final sixteenth by the rallying rival. NEW EAGLE pressed the early pace while trekking the two path, rated
close up at upper stretch, but failed to sustain the bid in final furlong. MAU MAU travelled widest of all and lost ground to front runners. LOVETHATCAUSE
flashed early speed on a ground saving trip before fading in crucial strides. POP LIFE tired in the late stages after travelling four wide.

LUCKENBACHER proved best in stretch duel after looming through the opening half as the solo foe in the second flight and gaining a slight advantage at
upper stretch. BINDING showed reserve in early strides, angled out to advance on leaders with a three wide move near the three eighths pole, rated close
up at upper stretch as the outer rival of three abreast but was outdueled in final furlong and just missed the score. TEMPRANO settled into the two path
through the opening half, angled out near the three sixteenths pole, and finished with a strong kick to be gaining on leaders at finish. DONNA'S COURT
failed to sustain the bid after rushing from outset and leading the field from outset to upper stretch. LUCKY STREAKER was unhurried through the opening
turn, closed the gap on leaders along the backstretch, then tired in closing stages.

Footnotes
LADY JEOPARDY rushed from outset, led at first call, and never relished command while steadily widening the margin for a clear gate tow ire victory.
EMPTY NET trekked the three path and rated in the second flight around the first turn and along the backstretch, led the second flight at upper stretch, and
proved second best, but was no match for the runaway winner. SWIZZLECITY travelled widest in the early stages, advanced on leader when roused
nearing the quarter pole, and just missed the place with a late rally. CAGED BEAR came up empty and lacked a needed rally to end a ground saving trip. PI
YO PRINCESS settled into mid pack, trekked the inside line, and finished evenly. SAINT KENNEDY lacked a needed rally after settling into mid pack early
on and travelling wide. MY ALIBI rated back and passed tiring foes. BRODIE BABY was unhurried through the opening half, angled out to widest of all at
upper stretch, but failed to gain placing in closing strides. FIRSTSLATE stalked the early front runner from a two path stance, then faded inside the half pole.

Footnotes
CATHOLIC GUILT rushed form outset and gained first command, led the field through the half while tracking the inside path, relished command to rallying
rival at upper stretch, then came again in closing strides for the score. GUNNER PAUL tucked behind early front runners and saved ground around the
opening bend, kept the inside line through the final turn and rallied along the inside to secure the place. TIZ SHOWBIZ was reserved in the opening half,
angled out and circled foes near the three eighths pole and through the final turn, gained command at upper stretch, but was caught in closing strides by top
pair. FIRST AVENUE settled into mid pack in the early going, closed the gap on leaders entering the final turn, angled out at upper stretch and rallied with
strong late kick to be gaining at the finish. MR. B CAUSE stalked the early pacesetter from a three wide stance, rated between rivals and ont he heels of
front runenr at upper stretch, but failed to match strides in final furlong. HARDCORE FOLKLORE rated back in the early half then angled out to four wide at
upper stretch and finished with mild gain. RANCHO BARGO lacked a needed response to end a wide journey. ALLIGATOR CRAWL improved placing with
late interest after trailing the field midway. MESABI retreated rapidly after pressing the early pace from a two path stance. TALE TWISTER gave chase from
an inside stance, swung out to be widest of all at upper stretch, then tired in late stages.

place after stalking the pacesetter from a two path pose and rating three wide at upper stretch. ONE HITTER rallied along the rail for the show to end a
ground saving journey. WATSONS BAY finished with a late rush to improve placing after giving chase from between rival. DEALMEINBUD settled into mid
pack and awaited options, rated between rivals at upper stretch, then closed fast in final furlong. DREAM BOSS rushed from outset to lead the second flight
