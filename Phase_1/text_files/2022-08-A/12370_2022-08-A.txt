NEXT TIME YOU WIN broke outward, jostled briefly with G CITY WARRIOR, moved to the outside before finishing the first furlong, advanced three wide on
the bend, engaged the latter from just outside upper stretch, brushed with G CITY WARRIOR a couple times as she fought tor the lead and finished on even
terms with G CITY WARRIOR for the win. G CITY WARRIOR bumped a couple times at the break, was settled briefly, went for the lead between horses
before finishing two furlongs, moved ahead two wide on the turn, was challenged upper stretch, brushed with NEXT TIME YOU WIN a few times as she
battled to hold the advantage, never relented and held, as well, for the win. TWO MORE TIMES well placed from inside, swung out nearing the end of a half
mile, angled out widest upper stretch, took over third, drifted out under left-handed pressure approaching the sixteenth marker, was corrected and finished
evenly. MEETMEINSTLOUIE soon moved clear after the start, was challenged with a half mile left and steadily yielded before finishing four furlongs.

Footnotes
BOBBIE TOO TOO bumped with GHAALEB'S SICILIAN at the start, was quickly ahead of the rest, showed the way from inside then maintained full control
with mild urging in the lane. MIZ CLIPPER moved to the outside early on, progressed three wide on the turn, fanned outside JUKEBOX MONEY for the
drive, took over second nearing the final furlong, steadily pulled away for the place and was drifting out under left-handed pressure in the waning yards.
JUKEBOX MONEY pressed BOBBIE TOO TOO from outside, floated out to path three into the stretch, began to fade approaching the last eighth and was
bearing out in the late going. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN bumped with BOBBIE TOO TOO at the break, raced in contention on the backstretch but started to
yield from inside on the bend. SINGING ALLI was prominent between horses on the backstretch but gave way before finishing a half mile.

AUNT STELLA pressed the early lead from outside, went for the lead on the bend, moved ahead when roused leaving the turn, edged ahead upper stretch,
moved clear inside the last furlong and kept THINK BLUE at bay under steady urging. THINK BLUE broke outward, was corrected then ducked into the gap
leaving the chute, straightened again, advanced inside, rallied belated two wide the final furlong but was clearly second best. HELEN MAE'S SONG set a
pressured pace just off the inside, was challenged on the turn, gained the rail in the stretch, gradually yielded but was unchallenged for the show. LOUIE P
crowded briefly at the start, moved to the outside early on, was widest through the turn and had no stretch bid. PALM COURT in contention early toward the
outside, began to yield three wide on the bend. DARING DAMSEL saved ground to no avail.

TOUCH BY FELICTY rated on the front end toward the outside, moved clear when allowed after a quarter mile, angled in on the bend, was put to urging
upper stretch and maintained full control under steady handling. PECOS AUTUMN prominent from outside, progressed three wide on the turn, took over
second nearing the final furlong, was no match for TOUCH BY FELICTY but pulled away for the place. WITCHING displayed early speed just off the rail, did
not stay with TOUCH BY FELICTY into the turn and wore down the final eighth. DELTA LADY contested the pace from inside on the backstretch, retreated
on the bend, steadily yielded in the lane, angled out inside the final furlong and continued to fade. QUEEN EKATI helped prompt the early pace, angled out
widest on the turn, was unresponsive to urging upper stretch, pulled up inside the last eighth, bled from her nostrils and was walked off.

Footnotes
SOME DUDE broke alertly, was settled back, gradually progressed from outside while under urging on the backstretch, came into contention on the second
turn, moved to the inside midway on that bend, was roused, gained the advantage inside rivals entering the lane, moved clear upper stretch and held sway
under steady handling. BLOOMING GARDEN pressed the early speed from just outside, vied for the lead on the second bend, did not stay with SOME
DUDE upper stretch, lacked the extra needed in the late going but proved easily second best. RIP IT RYAN settled just off the inside, picked up his pace
after a half mile, gained a striking position four wide on the second turn, fanned out further for the stretch run, could not sustain his bid but gained third late.
CLEVER BOY failed to menace. CALL ME DROSSEL soon had the lead, showed the way just off the inside, was challenged from both sides on the second
bend and gave way between rivals the last quarter mile. A BIG A BAD BILL was hustled to prompt the early pace from inside, gave way with three furlongs
to go, was unresponsive to urging upper stretch, allowed to distance himself the final furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
LIL BIT TIPSEY rated from outside, was crowded as she took over with a half mile to go, drew clear on the bend, responded to mild urging in the lane and
steadily opened up on the rest. ALMAFUERTE vied for the early lead outside ARCHIE'S GIRL, brushed with LIL BIT TIPSEY when the latter came beside
her at the half mile marker, did not keep up into the turn, saved ground through the bend, angled outside LIL BIT TIPSEY upper stretch, started drifting out
nearing the eighth pole, held a straight path inside the final furlong and proved easily second best. WATCHIN THE WHEELS raced in contention just off the
inside on the backstretch, did not stay close widest on the turn, angled in some entering the lane, had no rally but caught the fading ARCHIE'S GIRL for
third near the wire. ARCHIE'S GIRL displayed early speed from inside, began to fade before finishing three furlongs, gradually angled out through the turn,
came widest into the stretch and continued to yield.

Footnotes
FOOT RUB LOVE rated from outside, was three wide on the turn, roused leaving the quarter pole, edged ahead midstretch, was under steady urging and
narrowly prevailed. MARYS LAST SONG prominent running widest, advanced four wide on the bend, rallied belatedly the final furlong, gained second
seventy yards out and was a stride too late for the win. ORDAINED KISS was boxed in between rivals behind the early leaders, checked back from tight
quarters midway on the backstretch, altered out some, angled in entering the turn, moved out widest at the top of the stretch, made a strong move the last
eighth, was too late but caught TRIPLE SCOUT for third. TRIPLE SCOUT was sent to contest the pace between horses, stayed in path two on the turn,
battled in the lane but slowly wore down inside the final furlong. STORMY EMPIRE was also boxed in behind the leaders in the early going, jostled briefly
with PALAGO into the bend and was steadied, retreated three wide on the turn, regained a striking position upper stretch, gradually moved to the inside
after entering the last eighth and leveled off. GHAALEB'S MAGIC displayed early speed just off the inside, did not keep up while along the rail on the turn,
continued to gradually yield in the lane and was angled out with a sixteenth left. PALAGO also boxed in on the backstretch, jostled briefly with STORMY
EMPIRE into the turn and began to fade two wide soon after. MENDING broke on top, disputed the pace from inside, began to fade after a furlong, steadily
gave way, distanced herself from the rest before a half mile was finished and walked off after the race.
