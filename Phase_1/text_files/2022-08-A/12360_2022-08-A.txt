Footnotes
WEGOTTAGUY broke alertly and moved clear then increased his lead through the stretch under moderate pressure. TURTLENECK TED broke sluggishly,
swung very wide into the stretch and closed well while no threat to the winner. DUCK DUCKY GOOSE raced wide off the pace throughout and came up
empty. SWEET PARI lacked speed then offered some late energy while no threat. WORLD REGARD saved ground off the pace and began fading on the
turn. GAVILAN prompted the winner outside to the stretch and gave way. JOE THE BOSS trailed far behind then passed a stopping opponent. DUKE OF
WELLS broke slowest and was always outrun.

Footnotes
CATCH MY VIBE took control inside, pulled away on the turn and remained clear the remainder of the trip under moderate pressure. SCOTCH ROCK'S
lacked speed, split rivals advancing into the stretch and closed well too late. DONT BREAK THE LAW hesitated at the start, moved up inside, bid wide on
the turn rallying, angled back in and missed the place. RUDY ROD angled inside rallying on the turn, moved out in the stretch then flattened out. DOUGIE
trailed early then passed rivals without menacing. BIZZY GILLESPIE prompted the winner outside to the far turn and faltered. LAWLESSNESS dropped
back outside, was asked for run on the turn but had no response. LAST INVESTMENT moved close up inside briefly then gave way readily.

REITERATE forced the pace outside, took over at the quarter pole, moved clear and just lasted. BOCA ROYALTY close up between rivals, faded on the
turn then came again and could not get up in time. SIZZLING ROMA trailed down the backstretch then close gap along the inside. SPUN D'ETAT raced just
off leaders three wide, bid on the turn then flattened out. MRS. CREWS dropped back at the start, made a menacing rally on the turn then faltered.
CAPTAIN SAM hustled to the front inside, vied through the turn then weakened. ANGINETTI lacked speed and was never in contention. CAWAJA TIME
prompted the pace three wide and was finished after half a mile. THIS ROUND'S MINE chased just off the leaders inside and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
TWO PRINCES outrun early, advanced three wide, took over in midstretch and gradually pulled away. RAVEN ROCKS saved ground early, angled wide
into the stretch and closed well while holding on for the place VERO SUN lagged far behind then narrowed the gap near the inside. NIANGUA trailed early
then passed rivals without menacing. PERFECT REVENGE roughed early, moved along the inside and was no factor. KIKKERLAND quickly sprinted clear,
was collared near the quarter pole and faded. FEARLESS FLY lagged far behind and was never in contention. E T'S DEUCES WILD chased outside behind
the loose pacesetter and stopped. ALPHA'S CANDY MAN raced inside just off the pace and stopped through the stretch.

Footnotes
LINDALOVESGOLD took control inside, set a measured pace to the stretch then drew off driving while much the best. BRUNO BARBER GIRL settled
behind the pacesetters, angled wide in the stretch, rallied but was no match for the winner. AZTEC BAY outrun early, moved outside and finished well.
PACHELBEL prompted the pace outside to the stretch and came up empty. DESI'S REWARD hustled just off the winner inside then faded in the stretch.
WINGS OF A SONG flashed speed outside then quickly retreated. MAGGIE stumbled at the break, raced wide on the turn and was no factor. ABE'S ARMY
was taken up into the far turn and had no further response. STONE IN LOVE was taken up soon after the start, rushed inside and stopped.

Footnotes
BREITHORN went after the pacesetter on the turn, led narrowly and just lasted in a tight finish. LOAD UP MOE lagged far behind, split rivals rallying in
stretch, just missed. DEFIBRILLATOR moved very wide on the turn and stretch and finished well. INDIRECTLY dropped back early, advanced wide and
continued well. SCREEN SAVER lacked speed, moved inside in the stretch and flattened out. CRAFTY JACK sprinted clear early, collared at quarter pole
and weakened. WEEKEND IN COURT dropped far behind after sluggish start and was no factor. I'M BLAMING YOU angled inside down the backstretch
and gave way readily. GO HUSKIES raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and stopped.
