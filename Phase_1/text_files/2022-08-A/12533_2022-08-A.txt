Footnotes
BOSSY BABY was quick to begin to set the early pace, raced well clear nearing the eighth pole and prevailed late under all out pressure. SHORT
POCKETS settled off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn, raced towards the outside in the stretch run, surged late and just missed in a
game effort. MICHELLE WHO stalked the pace, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and kept on to the wire. RAISE OUR FLAG was coaxed
along early, raced three wide near the quarter pole and weakened a bi in the final stages. STELLAR WAY settled off the early pace, angled widest through
the lane and had not enough. LATENITE SLEWZY coaxed along early, raced four to five wide and had no response. ZIVA DA'VID chased the pace from the
inside and weakened in the drive. FEARLESS FACTOR lunged at the break and never threatened.

Footnotes
HALF COURT SAM was bumped at the start, coaxed four wide down the backstretch and finished strongly in the drive to draw clear under strong handling.
LUCK IN MY EYES was coaxed along three wide early, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and was no match. INDY'S SONG pressed the early
pace while racing between rivals and kept on to the wire. MARK'S WARRIOR was bumped at the break, settled off the early going, angled out through the
upper stretch to race from the outside and moved up. BLACK EYED BANDIT broke in a tangle, chased from the inside, raced three wide near the quarter
pole and was evenly late. JUVAL broke out, bumped with rival at the break, dropped back early and lacked a rally. LOPIN JOE angled wide through the lane
and had no rally. MAGNUS WHO vied for the early lead from the inside and tired readily.

Footnotes
GRAN MANNA chased the top pair down the backstretch, raced four to five wide through the upper stretch and finished well to edge clear under strong
pressure. QUICK TO FUSS settled off the early going, moved up through the far turn, took aim on the leader nearing the three sixteenths pole, raced from
the outside and finished gamely to the wire. SELECTION PARK coaxed along early, moved up inside of foes in the stretch run and moved up late to
improve position. SHELLY D'ORO showed good early foot from the inside and weakened. REALREALGOOD dropped back early, raced six wide near the
three sixteenths pole and lacked a rally. BINALLOVERDRINKEN tracked the early leader just to the outside of foe while racing two wide, ridden just past the
three eighths pole and weakened in the drive. EBB AND FLOW was slow early and never threatened. JEDI JENNIE broke into the gate at the break, trailed
early, lost ground and raced far back.
