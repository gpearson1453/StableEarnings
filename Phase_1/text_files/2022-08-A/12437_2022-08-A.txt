Footnotes
THAT'S D 'CAT set the early pace along the inside, headed before a half, rebid turning for home, regained a narrow advantage when straightened for home,
could not match strides with the winner late, clearly second best. STRONG RULES forwardly placed early, fell back a bit after four furlongs, had little left for
the drive. MY GUITAR shuffled a bit at the start to break back, unhurried for five furlongs, closer along the inside second turn, tipped out three wide turning
for home, challenged approaching the furlong marker, edged clear late while being shown a left handed crop. SUCH forwardly placed while four wide
through the first turn, fell back after a half, trailed home in lacking a response through the stretch. FLASHING ANGELBABY pressed the runner up early off
the inside, took command before a half between foes, continued to show the way through the final turn then began to weaken when the real running began
at the head of the lane.

OUR LIBERINA with the early pace three wide after breaking alertly, dueled in the two path through the turn, held a narrow advantage into the lane, shook
clear nearing the furlong marker and held sway under steady handling. REBECCA G vied early between horses, alternated up front through the turn closest
to the rail, fell back off the winner when straightened for home, stayed on and was well clear for the place. LAWSUIT LUCY void of early foot, saved ground
through the turn, rallied mildly while continuing toward the rail to be slowly getting to the runner up late. SISTER CHLOE last to leave, made little impact
while racing one paced three wide. EXECUTIVE COUNCIL flashed brief speed while racing inside.

Footnotes
PURPLE ICICLE forced the issue up the backstretch from along the inside, continued to press turn, took over in upper stretch, drew clear. COLE'S
SENSATION behind the first flight just off the inside, came three wide for the drive, closed with some late interest to be in time for the second spot, no threat
to the winner. CIGAR VAN narrowly set the pace in the two path while between rivals, headed, fell back off the winner nearing midstretch, dove to the rail a
sixteenth out when chasing that same foe, caught late for the place. GRAY DANE with the pace three wide up the backstretch and into the turn, was four
wide into the stretch and faltered. COTTONCLUB SOLDIER off a step slow, moved up to mid pack, went one paced throughout off the inside in lacking a
closing bid. WIN AGAIN broke back and was never a threat. LAMONT was always outrun and finished well back.

Footnotes
DIATONIC broke sharp from the outside, cleared toward the inside exiting the chute, showed the way into and through the turn in hand, drew out strongly
through the lane to win as she pleased under a steady right handed crop. SABERFIGHT squeezed back start, remained back early, moved out, rallied four
wide out of the turn, in time for the place, no threat to the winner. KASENS TRIBE in the second flight early outside, moved closest to the winner through the
turn, chased that rival through the stretch to no avail, caught late for the second spot. ATLANTIC BAND forwardly placed early off the rail, fell back exiting
the turn and into the stretch, picked off some tiring rivals late to improve position not a threat for the place. TAP YOUR FRONT back off the early place,
behind some traffic late in the turn, improved slightly when clear for the drive. SADIE'S PORT back off the pace and the inside, four wide into the lane when
improving slightly, flattened out the final furlong to lose a couple of positions. IGNITE THE PASSION closest to the winner in the early going toward the
inside, began a steady retreat before a half. SWIFT N' STORMY finished early, trailed home well back.

Footnotes
A. K. A. GRAMS broke out, forwardly placed inside, closer into the turn, dropped inside once past a tiring rival, vied into the lane, closest to the rail, put a
head in front inside the furlong marker and drove clear. SHADES OF TRUTH narrowly showed the way up the backstretch off the inside, continued to show
the way into the lane, held a slight advantage with a furlong to run while between horses, could not keep pace with the winner, held sway for the place.
SPEAK TO ME pinched back at the start to be last away, moved up to a forward position the opening quarter, moved to challenge in the three path while
widest of the first flight through the turn, remained prominent on the outside through upper stretch then flattened out in the final furlong. RESPOSADO
lacked speed, raced three wide midway on the turn, lacked a closing punch through the lane. CARLOS LOVES TEE broke back, outrun early in the two
path, moved a bit closer into the lane then also came up empty for the final furlong. BETISON flashed brief speed along the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
TEASIN' TESLA broke running from along the inside, showed the way into the first turn, clear before a half, expanded that advantage far turn, headed by
the runner up entering the stretch, dueled past the furlong marker inside that one, found more late to gamely prevail. SPEED QUEEN close through the first
turn, off the inside, chased the leader into the far turn, advanced and collared that rival exiting that bend, gained command, drifted nearing midstretch,
dueled the final furlong outside the winner, outkicked in the final strides, clear of the others. ABSOLUTELY four wide when forwardly placed into and through
the first turn, settled in the run up the backstretch, dropped down to the two path far turn, roused for the drive, slowly getting to the top pair late while
remaining just off the inside. PATMEPATMEPATME pressed the winner off the inside first turn, remained closest to that one in the run up the backstretch,
had little left for the stretch run. MARIAH'S CANDY raced five down to four wide first turn, moved inside a bit for the second bend then lacked a meaningful
response through the lane. CAJUN TWO STEP fell back to trail after the start, picked off only a single tiring rival while never a threat. ABSOLUTELY MINDY
was last to leave, never a factor off the inside.

Footnotes
STRONG EAGLE with the early pace inside, continued to press the issue up the backstretch, shuffled back a bit when in tight far turn while still on the rail,
steered out three wide turning for home, late push outside the late leader to be up in time. RIGHTANDJUST broke well, set a pressured pace off the inside,
continued to show the way the middle half, continued to set the pace along the inside second turn, slightly larger advantage into lane, appeared to jump to
briefly lose his action a sixteenth out, nipped late. VODKA GIMLET in a bit tight just after the start, moved up to press the runner up from the outside,
continued to apply pressure the middle half, began to weaken from between the top two into the stretch, managed to save the show late. TAPAGE last
away, moved up in some traffic into the first turn, settled, caught in traffic again into the far turn, continued on the inside into the lane, went evenly the final
furlong in lacking a closing punch. MINNESOTA MIRACLE with the first flight into the first turn, checked up in tight along the rail, fell back to trail, moved out,
came four wide for the drive and picked off a couple of rivals to improve a bit, never dangerous. GET THEM JUSTIN lacked speed outside, three wide
through the second turn, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. YOUNG BULL within striking distance for six furlongs with a three wide trip,
backed up through the stretch.
