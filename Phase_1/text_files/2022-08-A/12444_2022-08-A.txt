Footnotes
FAST BREAKIN CASH sprinted to the early lead, raced slightly off the rail around the turn, drifted out a bit in mid stretch and held sway while kept to his
business. SOARING BIRD hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased out in upper stretch then chased the winner in a willing effort. GHOST GAME lacked
speed, raced along the inner rail throughout and passed tired rivals late. ASKIN FOR A BASKIN bumped with MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU leaving the starting
gate, raced in the two path on the turn and in the stretch drive and passed tired foes. NOMO RON stalked the pace, circled foes four deep around the turn,
floated out in upper stretch and failed to rally. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU bumped with ASKIN FOR A BASKIN leaving the starting gate, chased the pace in
the two path between horses on the turn and weakened. JIMMY THE KID , a forward factor in the three path between horses on the turn, chased the winner
and weakened.

Footnotes
TRASH TALKIN LARRY bobbled and bumped with a rival at the break, regrouped and accelerated inside rivals to take command leaving the chute, set a
rated pace towards the rail while handling some outside pressure, responded when roused soon into the lane, opened up under a drive in mid stretch then
held firm while kept alert through the final sixteenth. WONDER WATER , well placed stalking the leading trio, took closer order while saving ground heading
to the stretch, eased out and gave hard chase from the top of the lane, continued gamely and cut back into the margin through the final seventy yards.
RIPKEN , taken to rate early while off the inside, dropped in around the turn, gained along the rail into the stretch, sustained through the final furlong and
steadily bridged the gap. CALIPARI bobbled inward at the break and bumped with the winner, regrouped and saved ground off the pace, dropped back
around the turn, swung out for the final three sixteenths and had some late interest. QUINCANNON , three deep in close attendance, drifted out under
pressure entering the lane, corrected to chase a bit further then gave way. BOFFO KID , between rivals forcing the early pace, tracked around the turn,
failed to kick on past the quarter pole and weakened. TWICE GOLD lagged back early, made some progress four wide past the three eighths, altered out
leaving the quarter pole and faded. EYE'N A DEAL , four wide stalking the pace, failed to kick on nearing the lane and faltered.

BESTSUGARDADDYEVER lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, moved to the three path in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside horses, led
late and drove clear. TAKE A HINT stalked the duel while three deep around the turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch, lugged in in mid stretch and
weakened. BOX N BEN , rated behind the duel on the turn, angled to the four path approaching the stretch and lacked the necessary rally. LANDON JACK
disputed the pace outside NOAH CHANCE and weakened the final furlong. NOAH CHANCE , sent to the early lead, hugged the inner rail disputing the pace
and faltered in upper stretch. JUDY'S ARMY raced along the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. DOWSING ROD raced in the two path around the
turn while outrun.

Footnotes
FOOL YOURSELF prompted the pace two wide and under confident handling, cruised up to engage DOUBLE FIREBALL from her outside leaving the three
eighths, seized command in upper stretch, was roused clear soon after, widened under steady hand encouragement in mid stretch then was taken in hand
for the final fifty yards. BREVIARY , away last when having her head turned as the gates sprung, regrouped and settled in last, dropped inside heading the
five eighths, came out under asking for the drive and churned on willingly to gain the place. DOUBLE FIREBALL cleared early, set the pace towards the rail,
was collared nearing the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. STIR CRAZY stalked off the rail, was under asking three wide mid turn, shifted out
wider entering the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
BIG DADDY D R appeared to lean outward a bit and brush the gate, quickly recovered and edged up to bid three deep into the turn, grabbed a short lead
under rating leaving the three eighths, vied outside rivals mid turn, was roused clear entering the lane, shifted in and spurted away a bit past the three
sixteenths, kept on under right handed encouragement and held firm. BLISS THIS tracked a contested pace into and around the turn, eased out and circled
four wide making strides into the stretch, loomed boldly leaving mid stretch, kept on with good energy but was denied by his stablemate. SLOE GIN BIZ had
speed to gain a slim early lead, dueled between rivals into the turn, stayed on to contest the pace past the five sixteenths, gave hard chase from the head of
the lane and kept on with effort. CALLYOURIGHTBACK settled in mid pack while off the inside, circled four wide making some progress into the stretch but
failed to sustain through the final furlong. AWESOME DYNAMO vied inside a pair of rivals through the opening three eighths, pursued from the head of the
lane and gave way grudgingly. DRUM AND BASS , well placed stalking the leaders two wide, was under coaxing mid turn, angled three wide into the lane,
failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and faded. NOTION TO TAPIT , taken to rate while saving ground, angled four wide for the drive but lacked a bid.
NEVERFOLD , off the pace, came four wide for the drive but failed to respond. GALWAY LAD drafted back while four wide nearing the turn and never
threatened. BUKOVEL was outrun.

Footnotes
MUSIC AMORE showed speed along the inner rail, was challenged by LADY PUCHI turning for home, repelled that one late and drove clear. LADY PUCHI
stalked the pace down the back stretch, moved up in the two path leaving the turn, challenged the winner and flattened out. PHAROAH'S SONG , four wide
on the turn, had a mild move into the stretch then steadily retreated. QUEEN MACHA showed speed outside the winner, drifted to the four path on the turn
and retreated. CUPID'S STRIKE , four wide on the turn, failed to be a factor. QUALITY CONTROL raced in the two path inside horses on the turn and was
never a factor. TASWEYA bumped with OCEAN SAFARI after stumbling at the break, raced forwardly along the inner rail to the turn and faltered. OCEAN
SAFARI bumped with TASWEYA soon after the break, chased the pace to mid turn and stopped.

SWAYIN TO AND FRO , patiently handled three wide tracking the dueling leaders, shifted four wide into the lane and was put to some asking, closed in on
her left lead and joined PAISLEY SINGING in mid stretch, wrested command heading to the sixteenth marker, remained on her left lead and drew out under
a hand ride. PAISLEY SINGING broke sharp and dueled to the inside of RESPONSE TIME from the get go, held a slim lead past the five sixteenths, was
roused clear and guided off the inside soon into the lane, braced for the challenge near mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and narrowly saved the place.
MOODY WOMAN , bumped at the break, dropped in early on, came under a ride mid turn, angled four to five wide for the drive, stayed on her left lead and
rallied. RESPONSE TIME , away alertly and got into a pace battle outside PAISLEY SINGING, was floated out a bit entering the lane, failed to kick on
leaving mid stretch and faded. MY MY GIRL came in at the break and bumped MOODY WOMAN, straightened and moved up to pursue four wide, was
under pressure mid turn, angled a bit wider for the drive and came up empty. JUSTALITTLEVIOLENT , five wide early, remained wide around the turn,
shifted in near the three sixteenths and weakened.

VANCE SCHOLARS broke alertly and immediately sprinted clear, set the pace along the inner rail, was challenged by UNDERCOVER KITTY entering the
far turn, battled with that one to mid stretch then asserted herself and drew off late. UNDERCOVER KITTY bore out leaving the starting gate, stalked the
pace down the backstretch, bid for the lead outside the winner leaving the backstretch, remained in contention to mid stretch, finished willingly but was
second best. MAJESTIC FRONTIER hugged the inner rail throughout, finished willingly but failed to menace the top pair. SPEAKING SCOUT , three wide
the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, loomed three deep on the far turn, weakened and lugged in near the sixteenth pole. TOMMY BEE ,
always outrun, hugged the inner rail around the far turn. CLOUD PLAY , four wide entering the first turn, dropped back on the far turn.

SPEAK UNITY edged up four then three wide to track the contested pace, came under a ride mid turn, shifted out five wide into the lane as the leaders got
away a bit, came back under strong handling to engage GALLANT GOLD inside the furlong grounds, dueled, gained a slim lead near the sixteenth marker,
carried that battle to the wire and was fully extended to hold on. GALLANT GOLD prompted the pace outside WHAT SAY YOU while under a light hold, was
set down entering the lane and retook command, spurted clear under a drive near mid stretch, dug in when joined from his outside soon after, fought
valiantly through the final sixteenth and just missed. UNCLE JEROME stalked off the rail, was under a hearty ride two wide mid turn, angled four wide soon
into the lane to have aim then went evenly through the last eighth. WHAT SAY YOU vied inside of GALLANT GOLD and carried that battle into and around
the turn, was guided three wide dueling into the lane, stayed on willingly past the furlong grounds then succumbed through the final seventy yards.
CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO , well placed inside, was ridden along mid turn, failed to kick on, faltered and was eased in the drive.
