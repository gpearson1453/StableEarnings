turn then dug in through the final eighth to nose out YESSIROFFICER, who gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path, dug in through the lane to
take third the final jump, but was nosed out of second. REAL APPEAL gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and finished well inside. LADY

Footnotes
C R'S MANDATE rated a slim lead inside, was met and dueled from the half mile pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in under
steady handling to hold on well. SPUNMAN settled inside, bid toward the three eighths pole, lacked room closest to the rail on the far turn though, dueled
through the stretch for second. REMYS SHOWTIME raced with the pace and met the winner at even terms into the backstretch, dueled from that point,
contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. NOBALLSTWOSTRIKES rated off the rail on the
first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep, eased outward in the upper stretch and finished well. MINISTRY OF
MAGIC came away a bit awkwardly then saved ground well back from early contention, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn in the five and six paths and finished well; widest. HOT FUDGE SONDE settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened later yards. STORMIN ROCKET rounded the opening turn about the three path, gave chase nearing
the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn then weakened.

Footnotes
JUNGLE WARRIOR settled in the two and three paths the opening turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, took the
nod mid-stretch and edged clear later yards. BETTER BOOGIE rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn near the rail, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but was met mid-stretch and flattened later yards. CAYENNE CREEK was shuffled back
after the break then saved ground, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. NEVER
COMPROMISE saved early ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and finished evenly. MY SACRED PLACE
rounded the opening turn about the four path and raced well back leaving the turn, bid mildly from the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and
showed little in the lane. HENRY STANDINGBEAR raced well back saving early ground and never factored. ONE MORE FACTOR stalked off the rail, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded through the far turn. J J WEDGIT MAN was through early. LUFTY'S KISSES raced well back.
