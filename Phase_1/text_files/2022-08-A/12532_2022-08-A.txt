Footnotes
PERSEVERANCIA was steadied briefly just after the break, trailed the field into the turn, began to advance inside mid turn, angled out to the five path for
the run through the lane and rallied with an eighth to go wearing down the leader at the wire. KITTEN'S ROMANCE tracked the top two on the outside
through the turn going three wide, engaged the pacesetters with a quarter to go, put away her inside rivals midway through the stretch but could not hold off
the closing winner outside nearing the finish. SILVER DAHLIA stumbled at the start and recovered to lead, was headed at the quarter pole by outside
runners, gave way to the top two finishers mid stretch but fought on stubbornly the final sixteenth to come back on to get third. BLONDEONAMISSION
stalked on the rail just behind the leaders through the turn, angled out for the stretch run in the four path and ran evenly to the wire getting up late for a
minor share. MY GIRL SKY tracked the leader just outside, engaged that frontrunner at the quarter pole racing between rivals, battled for an eighth of a mile
and then retreated losing a couple of positions late LUZ DE LA LUNA settled near the rear down the backstretch, was ridden to go on mid turn, angled
widest in the six path for the drive, contended with a furlong out and tired.

Footnotes
SILENT GUROO was coaxed clear inside heading up the backstretch, came off the rail late on the turn, drifted out in late stretch despite right-handed use of
the crop and held sway. SOMEONE ELSE was forwardly-placed between runners early, eased back off the lead to track in behind, rode the rail through the
turn, secured the place but made no headway on the winner. ROSE RING tracked off the pace from inside, came out two wide nearing the quarter pole,
angled out further about the eighth pole, was gaining too late and missed second. MORE SAVVY switched out heading to the turn, went three to four wide
on that bend, ran on evenly. CARIBBEAN KITTEN broke a step slowly, moved out three to five wide on the turn, was forced out a bit further in mid-stretch,
lacked the needed late kick. ICE FLOE stalked from outside three wide, failed to rally. ROYAL CITY REIGN broke awkwardly and slowly, raced outside four
to five wide into the turn, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
NICOLE'S SONG had a good tracking position early behind the frontrunners, commenced her run with three furlongs to go rallying on the inside, split
runners at the top of the lane to take command with an eighth to go and was drawing away at the finish. T'PRING broke outwards at the start, was between
runners through the backside, chased the pacesetter on the turn, contended for the lead at the three sixteenths pole while three wide and finished up well
down the stretch to be second. FREE CARRYCOMB broke sharp to lead, opened up briefly inside at the quarter pole, was collared at the top of the stretch
and gave way the final eighth settling for a clear third finish. SHAZEEN trailed in the early stages and passed tiring rivals through the lane to get a small
share. PRINCESS LAVENDER pressed the pace outside down the backside, could not keep up through the turn while three wide and had little response
when asked at the top of the stretch. JOLIE DAVINA rated near the rear through the backstretch, was nudged along with three furlongs to go and had no
finish to offer through the stretch.

Footnotes
QUIET INTENT settled toward the back, began to advance in about the two to three path into the turn, fanned six wide, drove past in late stretch. STAR
SCHOLAR tracked mid-pack from between rivals early, went two wide on the turn, altered to the rail at the top of the stretch for room that was soon after
shut off, was blocked about the three-sixteenths then altered out nearing the eighth pole, gained the place late. UNDER SURVEILLANCE stalked just off the
pace, went three to four wide on the turn, bid about the three-sixteenths, was outkicked by the winner and lost place late. HARDWARE GAP broke inwardly,
switched out and advanced outside foes four to five wide on the turn, bid in upper stretch, was outkicked. SUPER HEADLINE was coaxed forward to dictate
the pace, drifted out a bit turning into upper stretch then back to the rail soon after, weakened. I AM RESILIENT raced up close early, dropped back a bit on
the turn going three then five wide on that bend, ran on evenly. STEALTH MISSION was up close early, chased inside, weakened. SNOOKERED broke
outwardly, settled toward the back, saved ground on the turn, came out in upper stretch but failed to menace. UH OH IT'S MAGIC moved closer and shifted
in three wide into the turn, chased from that path on the bend then came up empty for the stretch.

Footnotes
SILVER MAGNATIZED tracked behind the early frontrunners down the backside, rallied mid turn angling out for the stretch drive, took command with an
eighth to go and responded well in the final stage going away at the end. BUTTERED TOAST was allowed to settle at the rear early, advanced inside of
horses through the backstretch, rallied on the far turn angling out for the stretch drive and ran on well through the lane while not threatening the winner but
clearly opening up on the rest of the field. GOLDSTORM GLORY chased the early pace just outside, took command with three eighths to go, was headed
by the winner a furlong out and faded in the late stages on the rail holding onto third. HALLANVAARA rated near the rear after the break, trailed on the
backstretch, ridden through the turn and showed some late interest running to the wire to get a minor share. VENENOSA stalked mid pack in the beginning,
was roused to keep up on the far turn, and could not get into contention down the lane. LETS RUN TWO broke sharp for the lead, continued to be on top
through the backstretch, was collared with three furlongs to go, weakened inside on the turn and retreated in the stretch. BODACIOUS MISS rated mid pack
inside in the early stages, was asked between runners into the far turn and could not be a factor down the lane.

Footnotes
SILENT CAUSEWAY stalked from outside the second flight, went three then four wide on the turn, struck the lead a furlong out and powered clear under
urging. RED EQUINOX tracked in behind on or just off the rail, moved nearer the rail turning for home when room opened up, fought on to get the place
from SUPER LUNAR, who was well-placed pressing the pace early, came out from two to three wide turning for home and in contention, could not kick on
with the winner and was outfinished for second. TEACHER'S PET switched outside a foe heading up the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, tipped
out five wide coming into upper stretch and ran on. MONASTERY LANE shifted in, saved ground on the turn racing at the rear, angled six wide into the
stretch, was never near enough to threaten. ISHIYAYA moved forward to set the pace inside, came out a path into the stretch, weakened.

ROCKCREST broke sharp for the lead, repelled an early challenge on the turn and had enough late to gamely hold on for the win at the wire. REAL
MONEY tracked the frontrunners through the first quarter, started to rally midway on the turn, loomed boldly with three sixteenths to go and was gaining on
the winner through the last furlong just missing at the wire. FORESTER'S FORTUNE was outrun early to trail for the first part, angled out to the five path to
offer a stretch drive but had to wait briefly for a clear path and when clear was full of run late closing well in the end. WARP RIDE stalked inside mid pack,
angled out four wide at the top of the stretch to offer a bid and stalled with a furlong to go losing third. SPITE STORE stalked outside down the backstretch,
roused five wide midway through the turn and could not get involved down the lane. KAWACATOOSE chased the early speed while on the rail, steadied
mildly while inside entering the turn and stopped through the lane on the fence.

Footnotes
SILENT GHOST moved clear to dictate terms racing willing, was on or just off the rail, came out a bit turning into the stretch, put to urging and maintained a
clear advantage and held safe to the wire. SIMPLE SOUVENIR settled off the pace while switching outside a rival, went mostly four wide on the turn, swung
seven deep into upper stretch, gained steadily but too late. CARPE HORSESHOE tracked inside on or just off the rail, angled four wide coming to the top of
the stretch, loomed a threat but could make no headway on the winner late. VESPOLINA raced in behind two to three wide on the turn, shifted in a bit
turning for home for room nearer the rail, ran on evenly. BEN'S SUNNY ISLAND stalked three to four wide on the turn coming out five deep for the stretch
run but failed to produce a rally. MY GIRL HOOTER was bumped hard and sideways at the start and forced to steady, spotting the field a couple lengths,
shifted in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn but was never near enough to threaten. FORMENTOR broke outwardly bumping a rival,
pressed the eventual winner two to three wide, came up empty.
