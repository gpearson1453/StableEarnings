Footnotes
GIGANTE stumbled at the start, moved up to prompt the pace from three wide, made a bid from the three path around the turn, and drew clear. WELAKA
set the pace off the rail, was cued from the two path at the top of the lane, and kept on for place. LET ME LOVE YOU tracked two wide, was coaxed from
inside into the stretch, and held on for show. SKIPJACK rated between, was ridden between rivals into the stretch, but flattened. OCCASIONAL MOON was
well back while three wide and never threatened. BARAK was hard held from inside but was empty around the turn.

Footnotes
BOURBON AND ICE brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn, began a bid in upper stretch and dueled to the wire, edging clear late. BARAHIN bumped with the horse to his outside leaving
the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path approaching the quarter pole and dueled gamely
down the lane, giving way in the final strides. WICKED MAD raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, began to improve position while racing in
the four path around the turn, swung wider still entering the stretch and chased the top two finishers home. BATTLE OF MEMPHIS (IRE) trailed the field up
the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. OVERPRAISE bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate,
raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid. SIMMARDSTRIKE bumped
with the horse to his inside at the break, recovered to lead the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.
RULING FRONT bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the
turn and faded entering the stretch. STRINGFELLA dueled between horses in the early going, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and
tired from there. READY EDGE bumped repeatedly with the horses to either side at the break, raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the two and three path and was pulled up in the final furlong and vanned off. POST TIME FOR THIS RACE WAS DELAYED DUE
TO WEATHER.

Footnotes
CHECK THE GRADE bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to stalk the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid
from the three path coming around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew off to the wire. LA BRODY raced in the middle of the pack between
horses in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path, began to improve position on the outside in upper stretch, drifted in and bumped with V K
PRINCESS near the eighth pole and chased the winner home to just get second. BROADWAY PEGGY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn, drifted out and bumped with V K PRINCESS in midstretch and finished well, just missing the place.
DIFFERENTBUTOK chased the frontrunner on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced between horses in the two path around the turn and
finished evenly. FASHION ICON bumped soundly with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace between horses, came around the turn in
the three path and was outkicked in the lane. V K PRINCESS hopped up slightly at the break, tracked the leader on the inside in the early going, saved
ground around the turn, was bumped and blocked by BROADWAY PEGGY when that rival drifted into his lane, had contact with LA BRODY in the same
incident and faded from there. HIGH ARABIAN raced at the back of the pack on the inside in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and
made no bid. MYRRH broke sharply and lead the field up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn, and tired quickly in the final furlong.
SOME NIGHTS raced at the back of the pack early, dropped back to trail the field from the three path coming around the turn and was empty in the stretch.
BUMBLELICIOUS bumped with the horses to either side and was squeezed back at the start, trailed the field early, began to move up while racing four wide
around the turn and flattened out in the lane. THE RIDER OF HORSE 4, V K PRINCESS, FILED AN OBJECTION ON HORSE ELEVEN, LA BRODY,
CITING INTERFERENCE NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE SAME INCIDENT, INCLUDING THE
INVOLVEMENT OF THE TWO HORSE, BROADWAY PEGGY. UPON REVIEW, THE TWO HORSE, BROADWAY PEGGY, WAS DISQUALIFED FOR
INTERFERENCE WITH HORSE FOUR AND PLACED 7TH. POST TIME FOR THIS RACE WAS DELAYED DUE TO WEATHER.

BALISTICO pressed two wide, bid from the three path into the stretch, and drew clear late. BACKWOODS BOOGIE was unhurried between foes, was
hustled from the four path into the stretch, and ran on to place. NITRO TIME set the pace while shifting inside, was cued from inside at the top of the lane,
but yielded late show. SAVAGE stalked inside, was roused while saving ground around the turn, but finished evenly. HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE raced in
midpack while three wide, was driven from the five path into the stretch, but flattened. BLOODPROF was well back and two wide but never factored.
AMANI'S KITTEN trailed from the two path early but was no menace. ATTUCK was well away from inside, was taken back to rate but was never a threat.

Footnotes
QUEEN SHEBA bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to stalk the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from
the two path approaching the three eighths pole, pulled clear with a furlong to go and held that margin to the wire. BABY LUCK pressed the pace on the
outside in the early going, angled in to save ground around the turn, could not go with the winner in the stretch and chased that rival home. ABSTRACT
MOMENT raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and gained ground in late stretch.
MOOR STRENGTH raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, switched to the outside
in upper stretch and gained ground late from there. VIRTUALLY hit the gate leaving it, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and finished evenly. PROTON PACK tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. SONGTELLER led the field between horses up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the
turn, and tired in late stretch. BURNT MATCH raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the three path and made no bid.
BRINGTHEWINE reared up and bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced five wide around the turn
and was empty from there. SHEZ FIRED UP raced in the middle of the pack between horses in the opening stages, began to drop back while racing in the
two path around the turn and tired further in the stretch.

Footnotes
STYLISH WHISPA (GB) sat the pocket, was cued three wide at the top of the lane, and drew past in the final furlong. TRAIL RIDGE ROAD rated inside,
was ridden three wide into the stretch, and rallied for place. TEQUILERA pressed two wide, was coaxed in the three path coming into the stretch, and held
on for show. VIBRANCY was in midfield while two wide, was cued between runners into the stretch, and improved late. PRIMA BALLERINA broke out and
bumped, raced in midpack from inside, was in the two path at the top of the lane, but finished evenly. GASTOWN BABE rated from the four path, drifted out
in the first turn, was driven from the two path into the stretch, but was one paced. AMAZON QUEEN chased in the four path, was hustled while three wide
around the far turn, but flattened. ROBIN'S FANTASY set the pace inside but yielded entering the stretch. INFINITE POTENTIAL (IRE) tracked between,
swung six wide into the stretch, but weakened. CHICA BOOM broke in and bumped, trailed early and was no menace. IDES OF MARCH prompted the pace
three wide, steadied while three wide around the far turn, but was empty.

Footnotes
A LOT LIKE XMAS saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch and around the far turn in the middle of the pack on the inside, began a
bid in upper stretch, drifted out and bumped with CANYOUHEARMENOW near the sixteenth pole and finished well to get up in the final strides. KEN
LOVES KITTEN bumped with the horse to his outside at the break, stumbling slightly in the process, settled off the pace while saving ground through the
opening half mile, began to improve position while racing four wide around the turn, came in and had contact with COMMANDER BIZ near the five
sixteenths pole, gained ground on the outside in the stretch, drifted in and bumped with CANYOUHEARMENOW in late stretch and dueled to the wire from
there, just missing. CANYOUHEARMENOW raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated
the far turn from the three bath, began an outside bid approaching the quarter pole, gained ground down the lane, was bumped and forced to check near
the wire when A LOT LIKE XMAS and KEN LOVES KITTEN came into his lane, and kept on from there. HAD RIGHT raced in the two path around the first
turn, chased the leaders off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and improved position mildly in the final furlong. PRINCE'S
REWARD stumbled leaving the gate, bumping with the horse to his inside in the process, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch off the pace, saved ground around the majority of the far turn, veered out near the five sixteenth pole, interfering with COMMANDER BIZ while
doing so, and passed tiring horses from there. LAGERFELDT raced in the middle of the pack on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch,
began a bid from the two path around the far turn, improved position in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong while racing in tight quarters.
COMMANDER BIZ saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path, was
forced to steady when KEN LOVES KITTEN came in on him exiting the turn, was blocked again at the top of the stretch when PRINCE'S REWARD veered
into his path and made no bid from there. LONG STORY dueled from the three path around the first turn, took over to lead outright racing up the backstretch
and around the far turn, continued to battle in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong. RECTANGLE trailed the field from the two path around the first
turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and never fired. ABSOLUTIST dueled while saving ground through the opening
quarter of a mile, chased the leader up the backstretch, began to lose ground while racing in the two path around the far turn and tired further in the lane.
MULTIPLE CLAIMS OF FOUL AS WELL AS A STWEARDS INQUIRY WERE MADE INTO TWO SEPARATE INSTANCES IN THE RACE. THE RIDER OF
HORSE NINE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HORSES THREE AND SIX CITING INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH. THE RIDER OF HORSE THREE
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HORSE SEVEN IN UPPER STRETCH AND HORSE SIX IN LATE STRETCH. THE RIDER OF HORSE FOUR CLAIMED FOUL
