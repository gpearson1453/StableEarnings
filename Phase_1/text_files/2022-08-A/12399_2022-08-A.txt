Footnotes
SARCASTIC TONE with the pace from the start, dueled onto the backstretch in the two path, alternated for the advantage into and through the final turn,
held a small advantage entering the stretch and gradually edged clear under steady handling. HALF AGAIN broke on top, set or forced the pace for six
furlongs along the inside, could not keep pace with the winner through the stretch, saved the place late. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE away in good order, allowed
the two leaders to go early, stalked that pair the middle half, came in the path for the drive, getting to the runner up late while not a threat to the winner.
FREEDOMFI in the second flight while three wide through the first turn, continued outside and went one paced to the wire in lacking a closing response.
VANGILDER fell back to trail after the start and made little impact while saving ground throughout. CHAOSMOS last away, moved up a bit early to head up
the second flight, had little left for the drive.

OUT MAKING TREBLE back off the early pace inside, swung out four wide exiting the turn, exchanged a light bump with GENE'S FEATHER inside the
furlong maker, closed with good resolve to be up in the final strides. T D Z HI COURT broke alertly, narrowly showed the way into the turn along the inside,
headed late in the turn, regained the advantage nearing midstretch, continued to lead late, nipped at the wire, clear of the others. JOSAN last away, trailed
into the turn, got out soon after, was righted by late in the turn, dropped to the inside and staged a mild rally up the rail to be in time for the show, not a
threat to the top two. GENES FEATHER with the pace while three wide, continued to contest the issue into the stretch, drifted out and exchanged a bump
with the winner with just under a furlong remaining, weakened a bit in the run to the wire, caught late for the show. KANNON WITH A K vied up front along
between horses for three furlongs, began to weaken in upper stretch.

ONEROLLOFTHEDICE outrun early off the inside, advanced to a challenging position three wide late in the turn, extended drive to the wire, fully extended
to prevail while outside the runner up at the wire. DUEFORADATE dueled early off the inside, fell back and chased the other speed through the turn, rebid
between horses with a furlong remaining, dueled to the wire inside the winner, proved stubborn to the end. PUZZLING PRIORITY broke on top, dueled early
inside the runner up, continued to vie along the inside through upper stretch, weakened a bit the final furlong when unable to keep pace with the top two,
lasted for the show. RUMPUS in the second flight while racing off the inside, lacked a response in the drive. ROMANTIC BEAST last to leave, was never a
threat while saving all the ground.

Footnotes
LONG ARROW in the second flight inside, continued to save ground while within striking distance through the turn, tipped out into the two path turning for
home, set down, engaged the leader with a sixteenth to run and wore that rival down in the waning strides to prove best. HILLCREST DRIVE broke alertly,
cleared toward the inside, set all the pace, responded when the winner challenged inside the furlong grounds, gave ground grudgingly to that one, clear of
the others. KING DOODLE back off the pace and the inside, in the two path entering the stretch, angled out past the furlong marker and staged a mild rally
to annex the show. HYPERBOLIST lacked speed outside, four wide out of the turn, encountered a bit of traffic past the furlong marker, improved slightly
when clear. BIG ROJO balked at loading, broke back, saved ground turn, improved inside without posing a serious threat. BIG ACE forwardly placed while
racing three wide for a half, tired through the stretch. TIME TO MOVE in the second flight outside the winner and between horses, also gave way through
the lane. REAL MAGIC last to leave, trailed far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
TRINITY HOPE outrun early while racing three wide, shifted out a bit and was four wide into the far turn when beginning to advance, challenged outside the
leader in the two path upper stretch, put a head in front with a furlong to run, drove steadily clear. KATIE'S C moved up to be clear in setting the pace inside
before a quarter, set an unpressured pace up the backstretch and into the far turn, responded when the winner came alongside exiting that bend, continued
on equal terms past the furlong marker then could not keep up, clearly second best. JIG TIME BANDIT raced closest to the runner up throughout, lacked a
winning response in the drive, saved the show. CUPIE CUTIE settled off the pace, also failed to respond when called on for the drive. SHEEZA PRIORITY
raced in mid pack and was also found lacking when the real running began at the head of the lane. STELLAR FANTASY four wide into the first turn, stopped
after a half and was distanced through the stretch after losing contact with the field. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MARAMA broke well, stalked the leader up the backstretch off the inside, asked along in the two path late in the final turn, engaged the leader nearing the
furlong grounds, spirited duel to the wire, narrowly prevailed while fully extended. DAVE'S RONDA moved up to take command out of the chute, set a
relaxed pace while along the inside, remained in hand entering the stretch, responded when challenged a furlong out, held stubbornly, bobbled a few strides
from the end and was nailed at the wire. LAST DESTINY prompted the issue from along the inside, had little for the top in the late going while prevailing for
the show. CABO SUNSET in mid pack for over a half inside, moved out to be three wide midway on the turn, drifted out after moving a bit closer into the
lane, outkicked for the show. GRACE'S GAL fell back after the start to trail most of the way and made little impact. KIKI KAT off a step slow, also remained
back and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DUST EM took control first turn, rated in showing the way up the backstretch, responded when confronted from the inside and out second turn, plenty left to
kick well clear under firm handling the final furlong. JAX MAN last away, trailed early to be devoid of early foot, asked along far turn,came four wide into the
stretch, rallied while widest to annex the place while not a threat to the winner. DOCTOR LEO settled off the early pace, ranged up to challenge three wide
in the second turn with a middle move, could not keep pace with the winner through upper stretch, caught late for the second spot. BIG BOY DAVE REX in
tight along the rail into the first turn, moved out a bit and raced in mid pack up the backstretch, asked along in the two path second turn when creeping a bit
closer, went evenly through the lane. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY within striking distance early inside, lodged a brief bid along the rail and inside the winner
midway on the second turn then faltered through the stretch. CONGA BOY was finished after a half, well beaten.

Footnotes
BUT ANYWAY broke alertly to be clear early, shrugged off a rival while in the two path turning for home, drew off under firm handling the final furlong.
D'LADY FIRED UP within striking distance early in the three path,moved closest to the winner in the four path turning for home, proved no match for that
one to the wire, clearly second best. T J'S SUNSHINE in the second flight inside, asked along while continuing to save ground into the stretch,remained on
the rail and gained the nod for the show, no threat to the top two. CALL ME DARLIN pressured the winner from the outside, bid turn, failed to sustain that
effort through the stretch, weakened to miss the nod for the show. PERFECT PUDDING one paced throughout off the inside, failed to threaten. TENPINS
TEMPEST off a step slow, remained always back. TIZ A BREAKUP was always outrun while racing toward the inside. WINNING PICK FOUR NUMBERS
