Footnotes
VIVA LA VINO broke sharply and stalked the early pace while being carried five wide entering he backstretch, advanced three wide midway down the
backstretch to chase the pacesetter into the final turn, and closed determinedly three out from the rail in deep stretch to get up in the closing strides to
prevail. BAKKEN OVERDRIVE chased the leader through the first turn, and took command when BAKALLEY drifted wide entering the backstretch,
controlled the pace in the run down the backside and into the final turn, and battled willingly from along the rail in the drive, but was unable to fend off a late
surge by VIVA LA VINO in the final strides while proving clearly second best. BAKALLEY away alertly and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering
the first turn, drifted five wide entering the backstretch while conceding the lead, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in
the drive to garner a share. SOMTHING ELUSIVE away well and tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail,
rallied two wide into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. DYNAMITER unhurried early while dropping back to trail in the
run to the first turn, raced at the back of the pack with a three wide trip throughout, and failed to make a late impact.

STORMY BLUE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the second turn and in the run down
the backstretch, maintained his advantage through the final turn, and drew clear late under confident handling. DOUBLE SAW away well and tracked the
pacesetter into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, continued to chase the leader two wide through the second turn and in the run down the
backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, was no match for the winner leaving the turn, but finished willingly from just off the rail in the drive to prove
clearly second best. WISELY PLAYED stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing three out from the rail, began to gain ground on the
top pair while racing three wide through the second turn, rallied three wide into the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to garner a share.
GREYTOGO broke sharply and stalked the leaders while racing three wide through the stretch the first time, dropped back to trail in the run down the
backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. ABRIERWIN stalked the leaders from along
the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to save ground throughout, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon nearing the final
turn.

ADITYA broke sharply and stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, began to advance soon after entering
the backstretch, and launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, took control entering the lane, and quickly drew clear. MUSTACHIO tracked the
leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside, rallied from between rivals
through the final turn, was no match for the winner late, but battled gamely three wide in the drive to hold the place. MASTER EWEN unhurried early while
dropping back to trail entering the stretch the first time, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, commenced his bid from
along the rail approaching the final turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, and closed determinedly to just miss the place. AVE'S IN COMMAND away well
and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace through the second turn, battled from the inside of
MUSTACHIO in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with yhe winner leaving the turn, and was outfinished late.
ACE DEUCE settled off the early pacesetters while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the
backstretch, and lacked the needed closing response when called upon. JACK'S REIGN away alertly and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time
while saving ground at the rail, began to drop back soon after entering the backstretch, and had little to offer late.

GUNS N AMMO away alertly and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run
down the backstretch and into the final turn, took control leaving the turn, and drew clear late to prove best. DON WITH THE WIND broke sharply and raced
to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and into the final turn,
was unable to match strides with GUNS N AMMO leaving the turn, but proved clearly second best. TRAPALIS settled off the early pace while racing two
wide entering the stretch the first time, gained ground on the leaders while racing one out from the rail entering the second turn, advanced from along the
inside midway down the backstretch and continued while saving ground through the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to prove best of
the rest. A TREE OF LIFE stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, held a striking position in the run down the
backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more late when called upon. DR. BENNY settled off the early pace while racing three wide into
the stretch the first time, chased the leaders four wide into the second turn, continued with a wide trip throughout, and failed to respond when called upon
over the final furlong. BETTIN' MAN stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, dropped back to trail in the run to
the final turn, and had little to offer over the final furlong.

Y VEE R broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail through the stretch the first time, dictated the pace from just off the rail in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, repelled a challenge from SHARPZAN through the turn, and drew clear late while drifting four wide in deep stretch.
SHARPZAN away alertly and stalked the leaders through stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, raced into a tracking trip while continuing to
save ground through the second turn, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, loomed a danger midway through the turn, but was no match for Y VEE
R in the drive while proving clearly second best. ROYAL AIR FORCE settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the lane the first
time, raced into a stalking trip two wide entering the second turn, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to
garner a share. MISS THE HYPE settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the lane the first time, raced into a stalking trip two
wide entering the second turn, maintained her position in the run down the backside, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished two wide in the
drive to just miss the show position. SIDERO away well and pressed the pace three wide through the stretch the first time, eased off the pacesetter while
continuing with a wide trip in the run down the backstretch, but began to fade in the run to the final turn. HAPPYTOMAKEYOURDAY unhurried early while
dropping well behind the rest of the field through the stretch the first time, was always well back, and only able to pass a tiring rival over the final furlong.
BARBERRY BANDIT dueled fort he lead from between rivals through the stretch the first time, eased off the pacesetter entering the backstretch, began to
drop back in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer over the final furlong.

quickly advanced to press the pacesetter two wide entering the final turn, assumed command leaving the turn, and drew clear late as much the best. BABY
GRAND away alertly and rushed to the lead four wide through the stretch the first time, dictated the pace while dropping to the rail in the run down the
backside, battled through the final turn from the inside of PAY MY WAY, was unable to match strides with that rival leaving the turn, but finished willingly
from along the rail in the drive to prove second best. THE ALL BUTTON away well and stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the
stretch the first time, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. OUREVELADY
lagged well back entering the lane the first time while racing one out from the rail, bided her time near the back of the pack in the run down the backside,
rallied four wide through the final turn, and finished with late interest three out from the rail in the drive to just miss the show spot. MY COLLEGE FUND

through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, continued with a wide trip throughout, and failed to make a late impact. FRANKIE

ANIMA away alertly and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the backstretch, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final
turn, and drew clear in the lane as much the best. YOU DON'T OWN ME broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing two
wide from between rivals, drifted out and bumped with REPRIMAND while commencing his bid entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to
get up for the place. SWORD FIGHTER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched his bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, and found
his best stride late while finishing four wide in the drive to get up for a share. LUCKY LUKE settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, commenced his bid four wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive while unable to seriously
threaten. IT'S IN COMMAND away well and stalked the early pace while racing four wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the
final turn, but faded in the late going. RACING RIVER tracked the leader in the run down the backside while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, but had little left for the drive. REPRIMAND tracked the leader three wide from between rivals in the run down the backstretch, was
bumped and steadied off heels entering the final turn, and wasn't persevered with thereafter. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of
foul. The rider of REPRIMAND lodged a claim of foul against the rider of IT'S IN COMMAND, for alleged interference entering the final turn. After review the
claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish.
