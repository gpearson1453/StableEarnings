Footnotes
JOYFUL CANDY pressed the early leader from the outside while racing two wide, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished with good
energy to edge clear late under strong handling. ROGERS GINGER vied for the lead from the inside of Joyful Candy, raced clear near the eighth pole,
shifted out late and could not hold off the winner late in a game effort. OLE G MAN chased the early pace while racing three wide early, raced off the inside
in the stretch run, angled in deep stretch and kept on to the wire. KADEN broke awkwardly, settled off the early pace, raced near the rail at the quarter pole
and made a mild late gain. TARQUIN was off slowly, raced at the back of the pack early, raced three wide through the far turn, shifted out in the lane to race
off the inside and lacked a bid. GOVERNOR ATWOOD was allowed to settle early, raced four wide through the upper stretch and lacked a rally. ANVIL
chased the pace from the inside and faded.

Footnotes
LAWN DART tracked the early leader while racing two wide down the backstretch, took command near the five sixteenths pole and drew clear late under
steady handling. GET SASSY stalked the top pair down the backstretch, moved up four to five wide in the stretch run, took aim at Lawn Dart near the three
sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner in the drive. ODD GAL was void of early speed, raced two wide around the far turn, made a good rail bid in
the stretch run and moved up. ULTIMATE BARONESS chased the early pace, raced two wide in the turn, angled four to five wide in the drive and raced
evenly late. WINNING TOUGH was sent along early to set the early pace and faded in the lane while racing three deep. RIVETRIX dropped back early, lost
ground and never menaced.

Footnotes
SERENE WARRIOR tracked the early leader while racing just off the inside, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole, raced well off the inside late
and proved best under strong encouragement. BODE BY YOU settled off the early pace, moved up three wide through the far turn, made an outside bid in
the stretch run and edged up to be second best. TERRAZZO was quick to begin to set the early pace along the inside, dug in near the eighth pole and gave
way grudgingly late. RUTABAGA was rated in the early stages, raced three wide near the quarter pole, raced five wide into the upper stretch and kept on to
the wire. VAVITE chased the pace from the inside and had not enough in the drive. DOMINANT STRANGER settled off the early going, raced two to three
wide in the stretch run and had no rally. KICK OUT THE JAMS was slow early, raced four to five wide through the upper stretch and lacked a bid.

CATHMOR settled off the early pace, moved up two wide through the far turn, shifted out five wide in the lane and finished strongly to get up steady all out
pressure. K'S LITTLE BILL was away alertly, rated off the early leader while racing two wide, moved up two to three wide in the stretch run, led near the
sixteenth pole and finished willingly to the wire. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR settled off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn, raced four wide
near the quarter pole, raced from the outside in the stretch run and moved up to improved position. BIG CHICKEN MAN showed good early speed from the
inside to set the pace, dug in through the upper stretch and weakened a bi the final furlong. WORBOTHOR was unhurried early on, angled widest through
the lane and lacked a rally. ANOTHER BREEZE coaxed from the outside while racing three wide and weakened a bit in the drive. HE'S ON THE FLY was
void of early speed, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid.

EXTRASEXYBIGDADDEE stalked the top pair down the backstretch, moved up along the inside through the far turn, continued its run from the inside into
the lane finished well to be well clear under steady pressure. SUN DADDY was unhurried early, moved up two to three wide in the stretch run and finished
well to get up for the place position. SUMMER PALACE settled off the early pace, moved up along the inside near the quarter pole and flattened out in the
drive. CALL ME LATER broke slow, rushed from the inside to set the early pace, drifted off the inside through into the upper stretch and weakened. THRIVE
was forwardly placed to lay up early on, raced to the outside of Call Me Later, was fanned five to six wide through the upper stretch and weakened.
AUDRINA'S CITY was slow early and trailed throughout.

TIDAL WATERS stalked the pace from the outside, swung out five wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished strongly to just get up under all out
pressure. JULIE'S GRACE stalked the pace, waited just past the quarter pole for racing room, was hard ridden from the rail in the stretch run and just
missed in a game effort. NEVER KNOW CHRISTY pressed the pace while racing just to the outside of Whistler Dixie, made a three to two wide run in the
drive and kept on to the wire. LIMONATA was unhurried in the early stages, made a four wide bid in the stretch run and had not enough. WHISTLER DIXIE
vied for the early lead from the inside and weakened a bit in the final stages. THE NEW MIAMI settled off the early pace, made an advance through the far
turn, raced four wide near the quarter pole, raced towards the outside in the lane and had no final winning bid. BELLAS EYES was off slowly and trailed
throughout.

stretch run and stewards ruled no change. CUZ settled off the early pace, raced three wide near the quarter pole, angled out through the lane and had not
enough. GRANDE TORTUGON (CHI) pressed the pace while racing between rivals early and weakened a bit in the drive. JURA rated three wide early and

Footnotes
FUEL THE BERN stalked the early pace, moved up five wide through the upper stretch and finished well to be clear late under strong encouragement.
MAKES GOOD SENSE was quick to begin to set the early pace from the inside, had a clear lead nearing the eighth pole and was wore down to narrowly
hold the place position. SPECIAL STORY was unhurried in the early going, moved towards the outside in the stretch run and made a good late gain.
STUCK UP was coaxed along from the outside and weakened a bit late while racing three wide. HEATHER'S GOLD chased the pace from the inside down
the backstretch, raced near the rail in the stretch run and had not enough. LE GENERAL broke awkward, dropped back off the early pace, raced four wide
between rivals in the stretch run and had no final winning bid. HONOR LIFE settled off the early pace, raced three wide near the quarter pole and had no
rally. COUNTY COURT was off slowly, raced near the inside and lacked a bid. CLAW dropped to the middle of the pack, raced five deep near the three
sixteenths pole and weakened.
