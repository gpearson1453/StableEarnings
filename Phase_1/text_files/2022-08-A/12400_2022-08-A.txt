Footnotes
LOST ANCHOR took over in an early duel and set a pressured pace, was met and contested even terms two deep on the turn, ceded the nod into the lane
but dug in under determined handling to recover the edge just under the wire. TALENTED CORINNA pressured the pace inside, dueled at even terms
nearest the rail on the turn, took the nod into the lane and dug in gamely to the finish, but missed the nod under the wire. UNBRIDLED IRISH gave chase
inside, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. MISS MIDNIGHT gave chase after an early duel, rounded the turn about the three path
then flattened in the lane. GOLDEN GLOW gave chase though never factored. WICKED FELINA gave chase and rounded the turn about the five path.

Footnotes
DINNER BELL chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three and four paths, dueled to the lead just inside the sixteenth pole and was clear
at the wire. SMELLSLIKEMONEY chased inside, took the nod at the rail into the lane, was met mid-stretch and relented later yards. HINK'S PALADIN gave
chase, rounded the turn in the four and fived paths and ran evenly in the lane. TANELEER set a pressured pace, rounded the turn off the rail, drifted and
was met leaving the turn and flattened the final sixteenth. HURRICANE AMIGO gave chase outside, rounded the turn in the five and six paths and showed
little more.
