Footnotes
ABBY THE BULL DAWG saved ground racing well off the early pace, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, steadily progressed in the three
path of the far turn, dueled to the front mid-stretch and was steadily handled to draw off. OVERCOOKED stalked two deep, challenged toward the seven
sixteenths pole, raced at a close disadvantage rounded the far turn then dueled through the stretch for second. ASUE closed to the front while tapering in
toward the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn but
was caught mid-stretch and relented in the duel for second. NOVEMBER ROSE ducked in leaving the gate, rounded the first turn about the four path,
started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and finished evenly to pass rivals. SPUNKY ZOEY settled off
the pace in the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened stride. LADY CINCO DE MAYO bobbled at
the break then stalked the early pace off the rail, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. ENJOY SUMMER and
FORT ZANNA were not factors.

OBANNON rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert through the
lane. MIO GRACELAND settled off the rail on the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole but proved no match for the winner. SUGAR LIPS
settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn then flattened in the lane. AIR
MEDAL saved ground racing well back, bid mildly leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail. FOURDIAMONDSPLEASE raced briefly
close while saving ground early on, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn. LASHER stalked off the rail,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but weakened on the far turn. ROCKET J. settled in the three path the first turn and showed little response
through the backstretch.

CASTLE OF CAYLEE was bumped at the break but took over toward the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure past the three
eighths, rounded the far turn near the rail and was steadily handled to draw off. MARKET OF STOCKS stalked off the rail, picked up the chase from the
three eighths pole, raced close at the rail on the far turn, proved no match in the lane but dug in to maintain second. BOCA BIRDIE raced well off the pace
and off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, eased to the outside leaving the turn and finished
evenly to pass rivals. BONNIE BLUETOOTH stalked from the three path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then
flattened the final furlong. ANGELS CASTLE broke out and made contact with Castle Of Caylee then saved ground, started a bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened in the lane. DIXIE SUNRISE saved ground. LOVETHEONEYOUGOT rated close inside then
faded past the three eighths pole.
