Footnotes
BOOTDADDY JUSTICE lead the way into the first turn, then stalked the pace while in the two path down backstretch, was in a hard drive to duel shortly on
the far turn, gained command in upper stretch and held on well driving to the wire. GOLD BUCKLE chased the pace from the inside, was saving ground on
the backstretch then came out three wide on the far turn to rally in upper stretch, drifted in towards the rail, cut off foe then continued to close well down the
lane. FASHION NUGGET was unhurried early, then was in a steady drive along the inside to bid on the far turn, steadied sharply to avoid impeding rival,
then re rallied again and was closing willingly in the end. ALTERNATE NIGHTS tracked the pace in the two path down the backstretch then came out five
wide on the far turn to rally in the stretch but it was too little too late. IT'S THE SUNRISE chased the pace while two wide, was urging steadily entering the
far turn to rally in upper stretch then flattened out. JOHNSTOWN JOHNNY set the pace down the backstretch from the inside, then dueled shortly on the far
turn to keep the lead, was used up and weakened in late stretch. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY and JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following the race. The
rider of FASHION NUGGET claimed foul against the rider of GOLD BUCKLE for interference in the upper stretch. After review, GOLD BUCKLE was
disqualified and placed third.
