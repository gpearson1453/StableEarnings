the turn then moved out to three or four wide in upper stretch and rallied to be up for the place. ROYAL OUTLAW was placed off the pace in the two path
through the turn and was out finished late for the place. ALEX TO raced three wide down the backstretch, went five to six wide in the stretch and improved
position. SHKEURTAILFEATHERS was in the middle of the pack from the two path while racing evenly. ARCH'S WILD trailed.

WAR EAGLE'S RETURN stalked the pace from the inside move out to three to four wide on the turn to take the lead at the sixteenths pole and kept on.
LIGHT BOUND BID was unhurried through the turn on the inside moved out to six wide in upper stretch to make a late rally for the place. FELON raced in
the middle of the pack in the four path made a bid on the turn but couldn't match strides with the winner and was out kicked by late closer for the place.
DEJA CREW roused to be placed off the pace on the inside and retreated in the stretch. ALL SHACKED UP went to a clear lead through mid stretch and
was caught in the final sixteenths and tired. THE GREATEST EAGLE was not a threat. PICKELJUICE tracked the leader from the two path made a bid on
the turn and gave way.
