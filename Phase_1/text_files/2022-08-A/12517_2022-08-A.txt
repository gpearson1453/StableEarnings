Footnotes
Z U IN MY DREAMS pressed the early pace four wide, surged three wide to make the lead entering the turn, drew off under right handed urging in upper
stretch and lasted under strong handling. ISLAND WINTER vied for the lead three wide, drifted to the six path at the top of the stretch then rallied
determinedly and was steadily cutting into the winners advantage late. NATIVE VALLEY was in tight leaving the chute, trailed into the stretch then closed a
gap late in the four path. TALK DIRTY was in tight along the rail soon after the start, surged between horses to put a head in front briefly past the half mile
pole, had speed until deep stretch then came up empty. SHEZA HOOT broke in front, dropped to the rail quickly, set the early pace then wilted in the
stretch. O K BABY drifted in leaving the chute and was through after a half.

Footnotes
IAMGOINGTOSHINE chased the pace along the inside into the turn, angled out two wide past the quarter pole, surged to the lead then finished full of run
through deep stretch to win going away. NEXT GENERATION never far back, rallied three wide into the stretch, drifted inward behind the winner causing
her rider to steady at the eighth pole then finished second best. INDELIBLE IMAGE offered a mild bid two wide into the stretch then was outfinished. ONLY
ONE BOSS LADY failed to menace. WOLFIE'S PRINCESS had good early speed then faded. CLIFTONS BALLERINA saved ground, steadied past the
eighth pole along the rail and was never prominent. DIAL AGAIN chased the pace two wide into the stretch then gave way. SWEET OUTLOOK broke in
front, set the pace to the top of the stretch then flattened out.

LUCKY ANDY pressed the pace two wide, made the lead near the half mile pole, set the balance of the pace, widened through the stretch and won as much
the best under a hand ride. ALGORIX stalked the pace three wide and finished clear for second. YOU ARE AWESOME was hung four wide into the first
turn, settled two wide then finished determinedly in the three path. OPEN OUT saved ground into the stretch, drifted to the five path late and went evenly.
SUPER VISION set the early pace, prompted the pace through the far turn then faded in deep stretch. GUCCISSIMO was never close. FRED'S COUNTRY
BOY was hung five wide into the clubhouse turn then through early.

AFERDITA never far back, rallied three wide through the turn to make the lead before a half then widened the balance of the trip under a brisk hand ride to
win as much the best. ROSE KNOWS pressed the pace two wide then along the inside and was no match for the winner. LITTLE EMPIRE trailed into the
stretch then passed tiring rivals. TWILIGHT VISION sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the rail into the turn, checked nearing the five
sixteenths pole and dropped back. AWESOME WONDER had good early speed and was through after a half.

FAST FELIX chased the pace into the stretch, dug in three wide and proved best in a stiff drive. PRACTICAL MAN away alertly, set a pressured pace two
wide and held on for second by a narrow margin. DUKE OF FENWAY chased the pace two wide for a half, shifted out four wide and finished with good
courage. C C'S CLEAR CREEK pressed the pace along the inside and was outfinished in a game effort. INSACIABLE PRINCE failed to menace. WAITES
KINGDOM was fractious in the gate, lacked room behind rivals early then faded. HEARNS was through early.
