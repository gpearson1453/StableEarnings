Footnotes
MARYAM rated off the early pacesetters, was given cue nearing the three sixteenth pole, drove between foes and kicked clear. ENTITLED STAR lacked
early speed, swung five wide into the lane, and closed late. MADE FOR MORE chased five wide leaving the backstretch, took closer order at the quarter
pole, and improved deep stretch. BLACKBERRY LISA stalked the early pacesetters while four to five wide, and failed to menace. FAIRY BARB contested
the early speed inside of REDS LITTLE STAR, and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. REDS LITTLE STAR dueled outside of FAIRY BARB early, and
yielded in stretch.

brushed PERDITION while in close quarters near the half, bid three wide to hold the lead briefly and finished evenly. PERDITION pressed the pace from the
rail, was brushed in the backstretch, chased from rail but was outkicked for show. SHOTTHRUTHEHEART chased in second flight, angled out in the final
turn, and improved deep stretch. HERE COMES BARNEY set a pressured pace from the three path, held a short lead through the far turn, was confronted
at the quarter pole and faded soon after. LITTLE ROSALYN never reached contention, was eased and walked off. AMBER RIDGE chased early, was outrun
then eased and walked off.

Footnotes
LANNY MAC tracked from the three path, angled out to the four path leaving the backstretch, angled widest at the head of the lane, under a strong drive
shook off the inside foes and was clear late driving. ALL THAT GOLD hurried away, contended the early pace from the rail, held a slim advantage in the far
turn, went three wide leaving the final turn, stayed on well through the stretch, clearly second best. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES went four wide into the
opening turn, was under a snug hold into the backstretch then prompted the pace from the three path, was set down into the stretch but lacked the rally
required. ETU BABOU went five wide through the opening turn, trailed the field, lodged a rail bid but failed to menace late stretch. MR. KALYPSO sat just off
the pace in the opening stages, was unable to move on with foes and tired. LONE PIONEER sat in range outside, and had no response when called upon.

Footnotes
ROLLIN SEVENS broke alertly leading the field through the backstretch, took command into the stretch and was well clear late. IRISH TRICK stalked the
pacesetters while racing along the inside, was asked to quicken nearing the quarter pole then drove four wide, but was no match for the winner in the drive.
SIR BRONX settled mid pack while three wide, bid evenly inside and was along late for third. PRESS GANG raced wide through the backstretch, angled
down to the two path at the head of the lane, rallied evenly outside of SIR BRONX and weakened late stretch. DUNE D'ORO rated well off the pace outside,
chased four wide in the far turn, and lacked a kick. WHISKEY BOUND lagged early, and passed tiring rivals. MY LUCKY MARK stayed just off the
pacesetter through the backstretch, hustled five wide and faded. CHASKA chased the pacesetters from the four path, and tired.

LITTLE CHICAGO rated well off the pace in the four path, angled outside then drifted in and out through the stretch and won the bob after a long drive.
LIGHTENING ANNA sat in striking position outside under snug hold, was headed into the lane, was wore down through stretch and lost the bob.
BRADYDABOSS allowed to settle early, drove between foes at the three sixteenth marker, and held safely for show. CHARMING VINTAGE showed good
inside speed then took a stalking position, swung out then bumped KEEP YOUR COOL at the quarter pole, and finished evenly. KEEP YOUR COOL away
well the settled in striking distance outside, was bumped and knocked off stride at the quarter pole and raced evenly through stretch. DARK STORM
COMING emerged the leader leaving the chute, took pressured in the far turn outside of GRADY'S SONG, disposed of rival nearing the quarter pole but had
no closing response in the stretch then gave way. PAULIE WALNUTS trailed the field after a slow start, and lodged a mild bid in stretch. GRADY'S SONG
off a bit slow early, zipped up the rail entering the backstretch, challenged the lead approaching the far turn, was unable to move on with rival and wilted.
TINY TYCOON settled outside and failed to menace.

Footnotes
WEDGE POND set the pace from the three path, angled to rail then held a short lead in the far turn, moved clear into the stretch and finished under a hand
ride. WALKTHELINE lagged early, bid steadily outside under urging, surged late getting by in time for place. BACKSTREET BOBBY tracked the early
pacesetters, was roused nearing the three sixteenth pole but was no match for the winner and was caught late for place. RAILWAY settled in the five path
early, chased outside under urging, angled inside into the stretch, and gave best late. MARIA'S SONG prompted the early pace, steadied near the three
eighths marker, brushed the rail under right handed urging with a furlong and a half remaining, and weakened inside. TUCKER TIME stalked the
pacesetters, hustled four to five wide into the lane, stayed on through the stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth. HARD TO COME HOME sat just off
the pace from the rail, checked at the three eighths pole, and flattened in the stretch. SMARTY RIVER PANTS angled outside in the backstretch, and failed
to threaten. ROOKIE YEAR chased wide through the backstretch, and had nothing left in reserve late. EL NOBLE offered little. IGNITE THE MOON never
reached contention. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection was lodged by the rider of HARD TO COME HOME and the rider of MARIA'S SONG against the
rider of WEDGE POND alleging interference near the three eighths pole. After review of the Board of Stewards there was no change made to the order of
finish.
