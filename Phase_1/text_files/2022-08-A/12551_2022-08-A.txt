Footnotes
PANDEMIC GIRL tracked the moderate pace, advanced on JERSEY STAR nearing the quarter marker, re-rallied in mid-stretch and confronted that rival
nearing the sixteenth-marker, dueled to the wire and made a late surge in the final strides to prevail. JERSEY STAR broke a half-step slowly and was
hustled leaving the break, set moderate fractions through the turn, shook free from PANDEMIC GIRL in upper stretch but was re-engaged by that rival
nearing the sixteenth-marker, dueled to the wire and was bested at the end, while holding for second. SMOKEMS TAPHOUSE tracked the moderate pace
three deep, ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied in the final furlong and could not quite reel in the top pair but was well clear for third. YOUR ROYAL FLYNESS
was off a bit slowly, was green early on and lacked speed to the turn, saved ground into the drive and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ZU ZU FLYNN stalked the pace to the turn, gained ground four wide nearing the quarter marker, continued that advanced in upper stretch, was firmly urged
in the final sixteenth to get by SOMARA and was up in time to prevail at the end. SOMARA tracked the moderate early pace, gained ground nearing the
quarter marker, chased KAYLA'S COWGIRL into mid-stretch, overtook that rival inside of the furlong marker, was all out in the final sixteenth and could not
hold off the winner late but held safely for second. KAYLA'S COWGIRL hustled leaving the break and sped to the early lead, set moderate fractions through
the turn, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker, could not hold off SOMARA into the final furlong and yielded to that rival and held for third in the
end. TAKES A VILLAGE tracked the moderate pace, gained ground three wide nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that bid into upper stretch and
lacked a late response. RAMONCITA LIGHT lacked early speed, came five then four wide into the drive and was not a threat. GEMMA ROYAL chased the
early pace, came five wide to the quarter marker and could not muster a late rally.

LAKAYA settled off of the early pace while three wide, made a steady advance through the backstretch run and into the second turn, confronted LADY
BLACKBIRD nearing mid-stretch, battled with that foe to deep stretch and wore that one down at the end to prevail. LADY BLACKBIRD was hustled to the
early lead, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker, met the bid of LAKAYA leaving the eighth
pole but could not hold that one off in the final strides and was overtaken, while just holding for second. DARK INTENT settled off of the early pace, saved
ground through the second turn, gained ground in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final sixteenth, while just missing for second. SHARAC (GB)
stalked the moderate pace through the second turn, lost position in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

ENJOY IT STRAIT broke alertly and ceded the early lead into the first turn, attended to the moderate pace through the backstretch run, confronted the
pacesetter approaching the quarter marker, took command into the drive and was kept to task through the late stages to prevail. STAY LIT rated just off of
the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, swung widest leaving the quarter pole and came five wide into upper stretch, found his best
stride in the final furlong and could not reel in the winner in the end but was up late for second. UNUSUAL CODE was unhurried early on, saved ground to
the second turn, gained ground in upper stretch to come within aim nearing the furlong grounds but was outkicked late and held safely for third. HANS
GRUBER stalked the moderate pace while four wide, advanced on the second turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and gave way in the drive. MADE
THE TEAM stumbled leaving the break and was hustled to the front, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the
quarter marker and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
BET DE VRON broke alertly and took back off of the early speed, was roused three wide nearing the quarter marker, took command into the drive and
drove clear in the final stages. ULTIMATE DIVA chased the early pace, was steered off of the rail to go three then four wide nearing the quarter marker, was
not able to reel in the winner in the drive but stayed on to be best of the rest. PRINCESA DEL TIGRE was hustled to contest the early pace, dueled on the
front end while carving out moderate fractions through the turn, was overtaken by the winner in upper stretch but kept on to just hold for third in the end.
CHROME'S BEST COPY showed early speed and dueled for pace duties through the turn, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch and
weakened through the final furlong while just missing for third. ALL HALLOWS raced close to the early lead while a bit keen and steadied in tight quarters
nearing the half-mile marker, lost position on the turn, saved ground into upper stretch and did not offer a late rally. BOB'S VAI broke awkwardly and was off
slowly, lacked early speed and was not a factor. PURPLE NIGHT chased the pace to the turn, dropped back along the turn while racing four wide and tired
in the stretch run.

Footnotes
APPLAUD THE BENCH was sent to the early lead while in hand, set solid fractions through the backstretch run, extended the lead along the far turn and
into upper stretch and drew away late under hand urging. ON VACATION stalked the solid early pace, saved ground through the second turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch and was no match for the winner in the late stages but was best of the rest. ROSEBUD RYDE raced close to the early pace, lost ground to the
winner along the backstretch run and into the second turn, chased into the drive and lacked a late kick but was well clear of the rest for third. SLUMBERING
BEAUTY was unhurried in the early going, came three wide on the first turn, trailed through the second turn, improved position in upper stretch but was not
able to threaten in the drive. CHELINA lunged at the start and was off slowly, settled off of the pace, maintained position through the backstretch run and
into the second turn and was not a factor. MOTHERS DREAM settled off of the early pace, lost ground along the backstretch run while maintaining position,
dropped back in upper stretch and did not produce a late rally.
