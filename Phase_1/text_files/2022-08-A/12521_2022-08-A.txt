FLYING SUN, brushed at the start, was urged to a contending position three deep between foes pursuing the leaders into the turn, shifted out in upper
stretch and responded to firm left handed pressure to rally to lead in time with a solid late effort. BIG TIME ROB broke readily to gain the advantage from
between foes, dictated the pace on a clear margin into the bend while angling inwards, resisted a rival's challenge racing into the stretch to regain the
advantage midstretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner late. TATUM'S JOURNEY broke inwards exchanging contact with SWEET
CRYSTAL, was righted to track the pacesetter along the inside, switched outside that foe entering the bend advancing to challenge nearing upper stretch
but flattened out late. TOP HAT ARISTOCRAT, off a step slowly, then cut off at the start, was righted, then angled to the inside entering the turn tracking off
the second flight and continued evenly inside foes into the lane. WEST BAY tracked the leaders outside foes four deep in the opening stages, was carried a
bit wide entering the bend by UPTOWN DIVA, then continued four wide into the lane and faded in the drive. SWEET CRYSTAL hit the gate while swerving
inwards at the start crossing a rival's path while exchanging bumps with TATUM'S JOURNEY, then nearly dislodging his rider, was collected after his rider
regained his irons racing into the bend but offered no rally. UPTOWN DIVA broke outwards brushing a rival, was urged between foes pursuing the leaders
while getting out nearing the bend, bore out racing into the turn momentarily impeding a rival and soon gave way. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
ROMAN PHAROAH vied for command between foes from the outset edging forward to a narrow advantage after the opening furlong, angled to the inside
racing into the turn setting the pace, tipped out to the three path racing through the stretch and held sway to the end under firm right handed pressure.
RUSTY CAGE was urged along the rail prompting the pace in the opening stages, then was taken up avoiding tight quarters approaching the turn, saved
ground through the bend tracking off the first flight, then continued with interest inside foes to narrowly prevail for the place honors at the wire. TEXAS
LONG BOW was rated off the first flight in the opening quarter, angled to the four path entering upper stretch and made some belated progress in that path
to just miss for second. RAY'S ANGEL was urged three wide between foes in the opening stages, continued between foes into the lane and faded in late
stages. BIBLEMAN, forwardly placed five wide, then four wide into the turn pursuing the pacesetter, continued four wide into the lane and came up empty
late. EPIC DRAMA, urged four wide between foes pursuing the leaders in the opening stages, gave way early.

Footnotes
MEDALLA MATCH was urged clear while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, set the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, then responded to
strong handling to turn back a challenge from LADY HIDEAWAY through the stretch to prevail. The latter tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight
racing to the backstretch, advanced in that path on the far turn to challenge the leader while shifting well out entering upper stretch, drifted inwards, then out
under pressure in the closing stages and was just outkicked. LET'S SKEDADDLE, reserved last to the backstretch, switched outside foes after a half,
advanced on the leaders four wide racing into the far turn but lacked the needed final kick. BOW BOW GIRL was rated off the second flight along the inside
in the opening half, shifted outside foes racing into the stretch but had no rally. BEACH FLOWER was rated between foes in the second flight, split rivals to
lodge a brief bid outside the eventual winner entering the far turn but emptied out racing into the stretch. LATIN NIKKITA settled outside foes dropping off
the second flight racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. MY CRAFTY GAL, urged to a forward placing along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter
in the opening stages, lost position after a half and came up empty racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
HAP HOT broke readily, angled inwards setting the pace on a narrow margin racing into the bend, widened the advantage on the turn and held sway to late
stages under firm encouragement. JOHNNY UP angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing into the bend, saved ground
to the lane and proved best of the others. BLAME BISHOP, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the bend, lodged brief bid on the turn
but flattened out racing into upper stretch. BIG BOY MCCOY tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn and continued evenly into the lane.
KOVACS tracked off the second flight three deep racing to the turn and faded early. MARK OF VALOR, off slowly, trailed throughout. K C'S FIRST B M W
lunged prior to the start, then was taken in hand by the assistant starter as the remaining field broke from the gate while his rider dismounted, raced loose to
the stretch, was collected by the outrider following the race and walked off the course under his own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND DECLARED K C'S FIRST B M W A NON-STARTER, REFUNDING ALL WAGERS INVOLVING THAT
BETTING INTEREST. A CONSOLATION DAILY DOUBLE WAS CALCULATED.

Footnotes
PAPA RIZZO was urged to the lead along the rail setting the pace on a narrow margin into the first turn, dictated the pace to the second bend, edged clear
racing into upper stretch and held sway under firm encouragement. BOB'S ALL IN settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, as
prompted to advance after a half, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to edge rivals for the place honors late. SIERRA
HOTEL, forwardly placed three wide between foes in the first flight racing to the backstretch, conceded some position after a half, shifted out four wide
racing into upper stretch to advance between foes and edged rivals for a share. THIRTY SECONDS OUT, in touch prompting the pacesetter between foes
racing to the backstretch, eased off the leader to track that rival between foes into the far turn and continued evenly to late stages. THORN HILL CAT
angled to the inside tracking off the first flight in the opening half, saved ground through the far turn to upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. KING
NATE settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY, caught four wide racing into the first
turn while being prompted to contention, shifted inwards after a half while being urged to challenge with an early move but emptied out nearing the lane.
LOLLY EXPRESS was settled inside foes early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
MERLIN'S SISTER was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, steadily gained position inside foes entering the far turn,
came around a tiring foe racing into upper stretch to bid along the rail and produced a steady late response to narrowly prevail in time under firm handling.
INDAWIN, caught four wide racing into the first turn tracking off the first flight, advanced on the pacesetter three wide through the far turn into upper stretch,
continued willingly to challenge for command in late stages but was just outkicked. TIZ WONDERFULLY, caught four wide racing into the first turn while
prompted to a forward placing, was urged to challenge the pacesetter three wide nearing the second bend, took over racing past the three furlong marker,
went clear into upper stretch but faltered late. WILDWOOD MAGGIE broke awkwardly, settled last to the backstretch, split foes while shifting out entering
the second bend, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but continued willingly to gain position to the end. CSILLA angled to the inside tracking off the first
flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. SUPERSTAR BEA tracked off the first flight
between foes racing to the backstretch but offered no rally. BEYOND BROWN, urged inside rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening
half, gave way racing into the far turn. STARLIGHT TWIST settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. BONITA RAPIDS flashed
brief pace between foes and emptied out early.

Footnotes
HURTS SO GOOD sprinted clear of the field from the break, angled to the inside dictating the pace into the bend, held sway on a commanding margin into
upper stretch while being kept to firm encouragement and finished in hand nearing the wire. REMEMBER THE MAINE settled off the second flight while
being switched out racing through the backstretch, was prompted to advance five wide leaving the midway point of the turn and continued with a steady late
effort to prevail for the place honors. LIAM'S PRIDE, urged between foes in the opening furlong, angled to the rail early crossing the path of GIANT
GAMBLE, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. DAYS OF GLORY tracked off the second flight inside foes in early stages,
switched out nearing the turn, then continued evenly between foes into the lane. WHERE'S JORDAN switched outside rivals early racing off the second
flight, tracked the leaders three wide, then four wide nearing the lane but had no closing bid. RAOFTHESUN was urged pursuing the pacesetter three wide
racing into the turn and faded between foes into the stretch. MASTER GUNS hopped at the start and never gained contention. TIM'S BUDDY was urged
pursuing the pacesetter between foes in second flight from the outset to the lane and gave way in late stages. GIANT GAMBLE angled to the inside early,
steadied when losing his path nearing the half mile marker and soon dropped out.
