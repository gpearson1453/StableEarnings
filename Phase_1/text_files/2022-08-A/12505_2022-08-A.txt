place. LITTLE SAMURAI was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished fast. ELEGANT CRICKET was off a step slow, then improved
her position on the turn, slipped through to offer a bid nearing the eighth pole and hung. RUN LIKE KATE dropped back early, came three-wide into the
stretch and passed tiring rivals. PRESLEY prompted the pace to the stretch while racing two-wide and weakened. CARMON'S DANCE set the early pace
from along the inside and tired.

MASSIVE ROAR prompted the pace set by Two Step Jack from along the outside, forged to the lead on the turn and drew off to win as much the best.
HENNESSY'S SQUIRT was forwardly placed from the start, was carried out by Canyon Del Oro nearing the quarter pole and finished strongly when clear.
GOLDEN MERGER saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during the drive and finished in a mild rally. SPINNING BLACK dropped back
early, came two-wide into the stretch, angled out five-wide during the drive and was making up some ground late. CANYON DEL ORO was prominent early,
drifted out nearing the quarter pole and weakened. TWO STEP JACK saved ground setting the pressured pace, lost the lead on the turn, continued on well
to the stretch and tired. PER RULING FROM THE NEW MEXICO RACING COMMISSION, CANYON DEL ORO WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR A WHIP
VIOLATION.

OLDER BROTHER set the pace racing in hand, opened clear in the stretch, responded when asked and maintained a safe advantage. SHANGHAI MIKE
was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch, offered a bold bid nearing the sixteenth pole, but was unable to get to the winner. YES ITSA STAR
was allowed to settle in stride, came four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. TAINO HOUSE dropped back early, rallied seven-wide into the stretch
and was making up some ground late. SIDNEY'S HOPE lacked early foot, came two-wide into the stretch, steadied nearing the eighth pole lacking room
and finished willingly when clear. THIRSTY JUNIOR came six-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SANTALUZ DREAMIN vied for the early lead from
between horses and weakened after three furlongs. LIMITED OFFER was prominent early and gave way after a quarter mile. WINNIES OWN vied for the
lead while racing three-wide and tired during the drive.

Footnotes
METAROSE vied for the lead Gabriella Who, took the lead from that one nearing the eighth pole to open clear and maintained a safe advantage. KELL'S
KISS was unhurried early, came seven-wide into the stretch and finished fast. DIXIE JEN dropped back early, rallied six-wide into the stretch and was
gaining ground late. SO ELUSIVE was allowed to settle in stride, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out to come three-wide into the stretch but
lacked rally. BLUE LUNA WHO was off a step slow, then dropped back early, moved up three-wide on the turn and gained her best stride too late.
BERNICE WHO raced two-wide and lacked a response. LEMON ICE was prominent to the stretch while racing two-wide and weakened. GABRIELLA WHO
set the pressured pace into the stretch and tired. CAROLS BOUTIQUE settled in the middle of the pack racing between horses and failed to threaten. COOL
AND QUICK dropped back early and was not a factor. MAMIE'S WARRIOR lacked early speed and failed to menace. PRINCESS SUGEITH was prominent
early and gave way.
