Footnotes
I'M VERY BUSY brushed the outer part of the gate at the start before doing the same to an inner rival shortly after, settled off of the pace two wide, intently
tracked the top flight while traveling well in the bit in the three path around the far turn, patiently awaited racing room once behind foes turning for home,
tipped in entering the lane for clear sailing, unleased a powerful kick in upper stretch with a clear BAIE LONGUE to catch, blew past that foe leaving the
furlong grounds, and pulled clear. BAIE LONGUE stalked the clear leader as that one's closest pursuer around the far turn, ranged up to that foe
approaching the far turn, gained an advantage nearing the three furlong pole, drew clear turning for home, widened his advantage in upper stretch, but met
IM VER BUSY's relentless challenge inside the final furlong, proved no match approaching the final sixteenth, and held place. RECKONING FORCE
bobbled briefly a few strides out of the gate before receiving a minor rub from an outer rival, trailed the field in the two path around the far turn, moved out of
last before taking the far turn in the four path while still far back, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and stayed on well through the final furlong, but ran out of
ground to reach place. TORIGO tracked two wide, bumped an outer FIRE BARON while tipping outside of the top pair at the five sixteenths pole in hopes of
bidding turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, and gave way. FIRE BARON broke slowly, raced off of the pace three wide
around the first turn, improved down the backstretch to be within stalking range into the far turn, but was bumped four wide by an inner TORIGO at the five
sixteenths pole, and faded through the lane. CALYCANTHUS saved ground in midpack early on, was urged to attempt a rally two wide and between horses
turning for home, but failed to sustain a bid and made little impact. FULL COVERAGE was keyed up while inside of, and behind, foes through the lane for
the first time, pulled on the rider entering the first turn, steadied around that bend, then was done early. LORD OF THE NAVY scooted clear approaching the
first turn, set the pace in the two path before tucking to the hedge down the backstretch, but was caught nearing the far turn, then weakened approaching
the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
FAST N FEARIOUS was sent hard to the front, showed the way with a uncontested advantage, went around the turn in the two path, extended the lead
under one pop of a right-handed crop in upper stretch, raced under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, was given another pop of a right-handed crop
outside the sixteenth-pole then one final pop at the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best while placed under a brisk hand-ride to the wire. MOUNT
ATHOS broke awkwardly then tossed his head and was off a bit slow, had the rider lose his right iron briefly before regaining footing by reaching down and
adjusting it with his hand, raced towards the rear under urging, moved out with a half-mile to run, was corrected off heels at the seven-sixteenths, came
back under urging in the two to three path around that bend, gained under a drive into the final furlong and finished willingly to get the place. COLD AS
HELL chased the winner on the outside then in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened but was well clear for the show. GASLIGHT moved up under urging on the outside then chased the pace, went four wide around the turn and
tired. CHARGER was urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed
response. PICO D'ORO was urged along towards the rear, went four wide on the turn and was no factor. RESIST THE DEVIL was hustled from the gate
then urged along at the rear on the outside, fell well behind the rest of the field late on the backstretch and was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
TRAIN TO ARTEMUS stalked outside of the leader and from the three path around the turn, produced a bid in upper stretch, gained an advantage at the
furlong grounds, and drew clear through the late stages. NO PAYNE tracked from midpack along the inside, tipped to the two path at the three furlong pole
to move alongside BLAZING STAR (GB) turning for home, got floated four wide by that foe in upper stretch while between horses, yet stayed on through the
final furlong to bid for place along with her inner counterpart inside the final sixteenth, and prevailed for that position. BLAZING STAR (GB) raced close up
along the inside early on, backed off to stalk entering the turn, tipped outside of the top pair in upper stretch while inside of NO PAYNE, stayed on along with
that foe through the final furlong, produced a bid for place inside the final sixteenth while chasing the clear leader, but was outfinished by her outer comrade
for that position. ULIKEAPPLES set the pace in before clearing and tucking to the two path entering the turn, met the eventual winner's bid in upper stretch,
failed to keep pace with that one leaving the furlong grounds, weakened through the late stages, then lost action and bobbled while regaining her footing
nearing the wire. RIGBY stumbled at the start before being brushed by an inner foe at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but failed to factor. TAKE
THE BACKROADS brushed a rival at the start while breaking outwardly and to open space, tracked from midpack in the four path, tucked to the three path
while barely clear of IDAKA into the turn, then got floated five wide in upper stretch, lacked a rally, and faded. IDAKA laid off of the pace in the three path,
steadied mildly when an outer foe came across her path entering the turn, and made little impact. CONSTITUTIONALRAGE was squeezed back between
horses soon after the start, trailed the field in the two to three path around the turn, shifted to the six path entering the lane, but was outrun.

Footnotes
DAMON'S MOUND settled in a perfect position behind the leading trio, tipped four wide leaving the backstretch, ranged up to make a bid coming to the
five-sixteenths, jostled with GULFPORT while that foe checked in crowded quarters shortly thereafter, took the lead into upper stretch while being thrown in
by the rider to elicit a lead change, responded to that maneuver and swapped to the proper lead while moving clear inside the three-sixteenths, was given
one pop of a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then placed under a hand-ride to the wire to prevail. GULFPORT disputed the pace on the outside
of two foes, dropped back a bit late on the backstretch, chased four then three wide around the turn, jostled with DAMON'S MOUND while making a bid
between foes just inside the five-sixteenths then checked sharply, lost several lengths to the front two at that juncture, regained some momentum under a
drive into upper stretch, drifted out in pursuit around the eighth-pole, kept on well in the final furlong and safely secured the place. SUPER CHOW veered in
at the start then was corrected by the rider, disputed the pace on the inside of two foes while off the rail, held a solo lead past the nine-sixteenths, vied in the
two path under a loose right-rein while getting some extra left-rein pressure on the turn, lugged out three wide into the stretch, lost the advantage around the
three-sixteenths, dropped back then moved out into the final furlong and weakened. VALENZAN DAY broke in a bit then was hustled, contested the pace
between horses, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went three wide around the turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
VALLELUJAH tucked behind foes leaving the chute, saved ground around the bend while creeping closer under mild coaxing, sustained a bid for the lead
along the rail entering the lane, gained an advantage in upper stretch, and inched away through the final furlong. SWEET MYSTERY prompted the pace two
wide and from between horses, took the bend in the three path due to the leader staying off of the rail, got outkicked by a rail bidding rival entering the lane,
chased that foe thereafter while hanging on her left lead, vied for place in the final sixteenth, and prevailed for that position at the wire. TOSCONOVA
BEAUTY set the pace inside of a pair of foes while intentionally remaining a path off of the rail around the turn, which allowed for VALLELUJAH to present a
rail challenge entering the lane, fought on after being headed by that rival in upper stretch, but yielded while hanging on her left lead at the furlong grounds,
and was bested at the wire by an outer rival for place. EARLY EDITION stalked outside of the leading trio down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace
while being put to a drive around the turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and surpassed a tiring rival to claim a minor share in the closing stages.
KNOW IT ALL AUDREY took a bump from an outer rival at the start, pressed the top pair from the four path around the turn, but weakened entering the
lane. CAPTAINSDAUGHTER trailed in the five path into the turn, shifted to the six path entering the lane, and failed to factor. SWEET MAEVE bumped an
inner foe at the start, tracked in midpack in the four to three path, but was done early.

path under urging around the turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong, kept on to the wire and missed the place but earned the show. TWO DOWN

shifted from the two path to the four path approaching the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and improved position. GIRAMONTE
settled towards the rear, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, spun into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. GOLDEN HORNET

the crop in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner outside the furlong marker and gave way. ME 'N SAP was bumped hard on both sides at the start,

heels leaving the backstretch, was asked while inside on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and came up empty.

Footnotes
BOURBON BASH broke on top and went on to set the pace, inched clear of a pressing foe at the nine sixteenths pole, widened his advantage on his own
power around the turn while taking the bend in the two to three path, continued to pull away when let out in upper stretch, and was ridden out through the
final furlong before being put to hand late. OHANA HONOR brushed with an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace two wide, remained in the two path
around the turn after his inner foe moved forward, improved inside of foes entering the lane while commencing a rally, and charged home catch his outer
stable-mate for place in the final sixteenth. GENERAL JIM tracked in midpack five wide down the backstretch, tucked behind inner foes and to the three
path entering the turn, launched a rally and split foes two wide at the five sixteenths pole to gain place while well behind the clear leader, tipped to the four
path entering the lane, but failed to progress in upper stretch, remained well clear of show entering the final furlong, but met his inner stable-mates
challenge for that spot entering the final sixteenth, and offered little resistance. SKELLIG nudged the inner part of the gate when leaving it, tracked four wide
while hung in the five path around the turn, attempted a place bid turning for home, but was swiftly outkicked by inner rivals at the five sixteenths pole, then
gave way while hanging on his left lead through the lane, yet maintained a minor share. WHAT A BLAST saved ground off of the pace, was driven to
attempt a bid for place inside of foes at the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked leaving that station, then faltered entering the final furlong. SURPRISE
PAYOFF chased the clear leader from the four path while between horses around the turn, but was outkicked by an inner foe turning for home, and
weakened through the lane. READ ON was hustled early on to press the eventual winner from the outside, but failed to keep pace with that one leaving the
nine-sixteenths pole, chased him from the three path around the turn, but faded between horses at the five sixteenths pole. MARTY'S MAGIC broke slowly,
lagged behind the field in the two path around the turn, came into the lane in the four path, but made little impact while hanging on his left lead. MR
MCGREGOR was studdish in the paddock without causing an incident, brushed an inner foe at the start, raced in midpack six wide and outside of foes early
on, but faded after a quarter mile, tucked three wide entering the turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
PORTFOLIO COMPANY hit the outside stall door when it reverberated back in front of him at the start, became rank under restraint on the inside early, was
taken up nearing the first turn, continued rank under steadying restraint for the opening five-sixteenths, was reserved under a vigorous hold, saved ground
on the far turn, was roused in the two path into the stretch, moved out some in pursuit of the leading duo, gained on those foes into the final sixteenth and
got up under strong handling. OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside in the three path, made a bid on the far
turn, dueled determinedly with CARPE'S DREAM into the final sixteenth, fought with good courage to the wire and missed but narrowly earned the place.
PIQUA moved in early, tugged at the bit under restraint nearing the first turn, was reserved in the two to three path, came under urging on the final turn,
swung five wide into the stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed strongly to just miss the place while narrowly up for the show. AL'S ROCKET
settled on the inside, moved closer around the far turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, moved out into the final furlong and finished well to just miss
the trifecta. CARPE'S DREAM was coaxed to the front, dropped from the three path to the two path around the first turn, showed the way down the
backstretch, was challenged while in the two path on the far turn, dueled inside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth, fought on well to the wire but missed
the superfecta. MARTINI'NMOONSHINE went around the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, came under urging in the two path on
the far turn, was driven three wide into the stretch, pursued the leading duo in the drive and lacked the needed kick. DAUNT bobbled at the start, angled in
quickly towards the rear, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved outside but with cover, moved out near the seven-sixteenths then
bumped with a foe, went four wide for most of the far turn then dropped to the three path, came under a drive in upper stretch and failed to rally.
OVERBORE was taken up while rank nearing the first turn, continued very rank under steadying restraint in the two path for the opening five-sixteenths, was
reserved off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path, shifted four wide into the stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker and lacked the needed
response. CONSTITUTIONLAWYER was taken up while forced five wide into the first turn then dropped to the four path, tossed his head early on the
backstretch, was rated off the pace, came under encouragement in the three path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and capitulated. CAPONE was
fractious in the gate, acted-up just before the stall opened then reared and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, went three wide on the first turn,
was reserved on the far outside, bumped with a foe around the seven-sixteenths, went five wide on the far turn and was no factor. MIDNIGHT WORKER
became rank under restraint nearing the first turn, was taken up while swerving out into that bend, continued rank under steadying restraint in the four path
to the three-quarter-pole, was reserved towards the rear, went four wide on the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
EXPRESSMAN set the pace while well in hand in the two path from trio of chasers around the turn, was set down entering the lane as his entry-mate took
aim to his outside, but swiftly kicked away in upper stretch, drew off under mild urging through midstretch, and was wrapped up in the final sixteenth.
UNLIMITEDPOTENTIAL leaned a bit inwardly at the start, tracked along the inside while pursuing his clear stablemate around the turn, claimed place from
outer rivals while shifting two wide entering the lane to take aim on the leader, but failed to keep pace with that one while pulling clear of the rest, subtly
shied from a left handed crop inside the three sixteenths pole before doing so again more vigorously inside the furlong marker, and remained well clear of
show. SOUTHERN FLAG stalked outside of the top pair while in the four path around the turn, got outkicked for place by an inner bidding rival entering the
lane, but kept on thereafter to secure show. CITIZEN MACK tracked two wide, tipped outside of the leading trio and to the five path at the five sixteenths
pole, and stayed on mildly without threatening. HAPPY BOB was slow into stride, settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path entering the
lane, but failed to kick on between horses leaving the furlong grounds while wandering about. FOR GOOD pressed outside of the leader and from the three
path, chased the pace setter around the bend from between horses, got outkicked for place by an inner foe entering the lane, and weakened. LEADING
CONTENDER was moving about slightly when the gates opened, tossed his head and spotted the leaders multiple lengths while subtly losing balance at the
start, raced far back along the inside, took the turn in the three to four path, swung to the seven path entering the lane, but lacked a rally. AWAY FROM
HOME was void of early speed, took the turn in the three path before shifting to the six path entering the lane, and made little impact. FINAL APPROACH
broke half a beat slowly, then tracked in midpack in the four to three path, but tired. GIMME LOVE broke many lengths behind the leaders while leaning
inwardly, and was well outrun throughout.

Footnotes
CASA CREED dropped back early on the inside, went around the first turn in the two path, settled comfortably at the rear of the field, was coaxed along in
two path around the far turn, swung five wide into stretch, shifted in behind a foe around the three-sixteenths then was corrected by the rider, rallied outside
into the final furlong and closed strongly to win going away. REGAL GLORY was coaxed along early, traveled around the first turn in the three path, settled
on the outside, ranged up closer with a half-mile to run, was roused in the four path on the far turn, gained to make a bid outside the furlong marker, battled
between horses into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked while able to get the place. MASEN (GB) was taken back inside of a foe early, rounded the first
turn in the two path, tracked the pace on the outside under a snug hold, moved closer with a half-mile to run, stalked in the three path on the final turn, was
given his cue at the quarter-pole, battled between foes into the final furlong, passed the sixteenth-pole under the crop and was outfinished but earned the
show. GET SMOKIN was hustled to the front, went around the first turn in the two to three path, showed the way in hand on an uncontested lead, navigated
the far turn in the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came under a drive under threat into upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop while
clinging to a narrow advantage at the furlong marker then was overtaken but held fourth money. FRONT RUN THE FED settled on the inside, was asked
outside the quarter-pole, hesitated while cutting the corner into the stretch, moved off the hedge while chasing around the three-sixteenths, had room
between foes if good enough in the final furlong but lacked the needed kick.

Footnotes
CALLOWAY PEAK rated off of the pace in the three to four path around the turns, fanned five wide entering the lane, rallied with a clear
THEREGOESMYMIRACLE to catch in the final furlong, ranged up to that foe inside the final sixteenth, and edged an advantage late.
THEREGOESMYMIRACLE stalked two wide, bid turning for home, drew clear leaving the three sixteenths pole, held sway from a chasing GOOD SOLDER
through midstretch, dug in to meet CALLOWAY PEAK's late challenge, but was worn down strides from the wire. GREG'S HONOR exchanged bumps with
an outer foe through the opening furlong, trailed in the two to three path around the first turn, moved out of last before inching closer while swinging to the
five path turning for home, floated six wide entering the lane, then produced a late rally in the final furlong to reach show at the wire. GOOD SOLDIER
stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair in upper stretch to take aim, but only managed to chase a leading THEREGOESMYMIRACLE through
midstretch, got outkicked for place at the sixteenth grounds, and got nailed at the wire for show. LEFT ON BOYLSTON tracked from midpack two wide, then
chased from between horses through the lane, shifted three wide at the sixteenth pole, and kept on yet missed reaching fourth. GROWTH MINDSET
nudged the outer part of the gate at the start before being taken in hand, settled far back along the inside, shifted to the three path into the far turn, swung
seven wide entering the lane to be widest of all, and moved up mildly. STRIKE PRICE traded bumps with an inner rival through the early stages, settled far
back in the three path, tucked to the two path, then to the hedge, around the far turn, shifted back two wide in upper stretch to surpass a stopping rival, but
made little impact. EMPIRE RIDGE tracked three wide, got floated four wide in upper stretch, and yielded between horses shortly after. UNION OF
THOUGHTS laid off of the pace in the two path and never got involved. SMART JOKER set the pace around both turns, but was headed passing the
quarter pole, gave way in upper stretch, and caved while being protected by the rider through the final furlong.
