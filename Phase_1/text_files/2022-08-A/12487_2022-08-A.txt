Footnotes
NO VALLA raced off the pace inside, then two wide, moved up three wide at the half mile marker, bid three wide entering the far turn, responded when
briefly set down at the top of the lane, then pulled away in hand. LA COSTA stalked early on, moved up with the winner on the backside, bid between rivals
on the far turn, dug in gamely in the stretch and earned the place spot. A RING THING set the pace on the inside, opened up on the clubhouse turn, dueled
inside rivals on the far turn, weakened and held on for third. ASHLEY'S HOPE trailed the field on the backside, came two wide into the lane and bested the
others. THEFABULOUS MOOLAH pulled in the early stages, raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked a
rally. NATOMA dwelt at the start, quickly recovered and caught up to the field, raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. SPRITE'S LADY raced two
wide off the pace, gave way and was pulled up entering the far turn, vanned off. After a Stewards' Inquiry, the race was declared official.
