Footnotes
CHIEF JACKSON rated off of the moderate early pace, saved ground through the turn, advanced in upper stretch, headed MEET THE SHERIFF nearing
the furlong marker, the rider lost his crop inside of the furlong grounds, dueled with the game runner-up to the wire and determinedly won the nod. MEET
THE SHERIFF tracked the pace, made a three wide move into the stretch, vied for the lead nearing the eighth pole, dueled to the wire with the determined
winner and was bested in the final strides, while clear of the rest for second. RHODIUM RUNNER chased the pace outside of rivals, gained ground in upper
stretch, was outfinished in the stretch run but stayed on to hold safely for third. STANFORD BAY was hustled leaving the break, set moderate fractions
through the turn, came under pressure near mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
OAKDALE ROAD was hustled leaving the break and disputed the pace to the turn, headed OBJECTIVLYPERFECT and dueled with that foe to the quarter
pole, took command into the drive and was kept to task through the final furlong to prove best at the end. MIQUEAS was a bit slow into early stride and
lagged into the turn, improved position in upper stretch, rallied in the final sixteenth, was not able to reel in the winner at the end but stayed on well to be
second best. OBJECTIVLYPERFECT broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set the contested pace to the turn, dueled with OAKDALE ROAD to the
quarter marker, was overtaken by that rival in upper stretch and yielded in the drive, while holding safely for third. GOOD DANNY raced close to the early
pace, lost ground three wide between rivals on the turn and weakened in the stretch. TEN THOUSAND STEPS chased the early pace outside of rivals, lost
ground on the turn and did not produce a late rally.

Footnotes
DUB TOWN stalked the modest pace from midpack, maintained position through the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch run,
confronted J T'S WATCH inside of the eighth pole, dueled with that game foe to the wire and determinedly prevailed at the end. J T'S WATCH kept close
attendance to the early pace, advanced on the far turn to duel for the lead nearing the quarter marker, took command into the drive, was headed by DUB
TOWN inside of the furlong marker, dueled with that foe to the wire and was gamely bested, while holding on for place. ORCZY (IRE) was unhurried early
on, settled off of the pace while not far back through the backstretch run, saved ground through the second turn, swung out nearing the eighth pole, found
his best stride late and could not reel in the top pair but was up in time to secure third. KNOWN stalked the early pace, advanced three wide on the far turn,
came within aim in upper stretch and was outfinished in the final stages. BROKEN FINGER was sent to the early lead, set pedestrian fractions through the
backstretch run, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, could not hold off advances leaving the second turn and gave way in the drive.

JUANA GALLO was sent while in hand to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the turn, was set down for the drive, drew off in the final furlong and
was ridden out at the end as much the best. IDA NEEDA DRINK tracked the pace, could not match strides with JUANA GALLO in upper stretch and was no
match for the winner in the stretch but was best of the rest. MADAME GAZELLE tracked the moderate pace, came four wide nearing the quarter marker,
lost ground in upper stretch and lacked a late kick in the drive, but was clear for third. BIG DIFFERENCE stumbled sharply leaving the break and was off
slowly, chased the pace to the turn, gained ground while five wide approaching the quarter marker and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
TURA LURA tracked the moderate early pace, made a two wide move to confront GET'EM TIGER nearing the top of the stretch, shook free from her
stablemate inside of the furlong marker and drove clear in the final sixteenth. GET'EM TIGER was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the
turn, came under pressure from TURA LURA in upper stretch, met that bid to mid-stretch but could not hold off her stablemate in the final furlong and was
outfinished, while besting the rest. BREAKFAST BALL hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the pace outside of rivals to the turn, improved
position three wide on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and lacked a late rally while holding safely for third. BENSON broke out at the start and made
contact with GET'EM TIGER as that one went to the early lead, chased the pace while saving ground through the turn and gave way in the stretch. NAP
TIME was a bit hard to load, showed early speed and tracked the pace to the turn, lost position two wide on the turn and tired in the stretch run.

LOUD FUSAICHI was hustled to establish the early lead, set moderate fractions through the turn, drew clear nearing mid-stretch, came back to the field in
the final sixteenth and kept to task to prevail at the end. SENORITA ESTRELLA bobbled at the start and was off slowly, chased the pace to the turn, was
outrun nearing the quarter marker, rallied in upper stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final sixteenth but stayed on to get up for second in the final
strides. TRAFFIC STOPPER was asked to show early speed and tracked the pacesetter to the turn, lost ground nearing the top of the stretch, re-rallied in
deep stretch, was outfinished late and was just edged for second. GOING TO SHABOOMS broke out at the start and bothered GEE STREET, chased the
pace to the turn, came three wide to the quarter marker and could not muster a late rally. GEE STREET lost her path at the start and was off slowly, lacked
speed through the turn and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
PARTY SPIRIT (GB) was allowed to settle while never far back, came four wide nearing the quarter marker, was floated out a bit leaving the second turn
and came six wide into the stretch run, advanced nearing the eighth pole, overtook FRONT OF LINE in deep stretch and held her stablemate at bay at the
end to prevail. FRONT OF LINE (GB) rated off of the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, gained ground along the inside nearing
the quarter marker, took command in upper stretch and spurted clear inside of the furlong marker, could not hold off her stablemate in the drive and was
outfinished, while holding safely for second. GOLD RUSH GAL was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, extended the
lead along the second turn, was overtaken by FRONT OF LINE in upper stretch and lacked a late response, while clear of the rest for third. CYCLONE
SLEW was sent to be forwardly placed early on, stalked the pace through the second turn, lost ground leaving the quarter pole, floated PARTY SPIRIT out a
path in upper stretch and weakened in the stretch run. LEIGH ANN settled off of the pace, saved ground through the second turn and did not offer a late
rally. FILLY PELLI dwelt at the start, spotted the field many lengths leaving the break and was never a factor. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO
THE START BY FILLY PELLI. THE STEWARDS RULED THAT FILLY PELLI CAUSED HER OWN ISSUES AT THE START AND WAS A STARTER.

QUANTUM QUEST was hustled leaving the break, set moderate fractions through the turn while well handled, responded to steady urging in the final
furlong and held rivals at bay at the end to prevail. COUNTING CARDS traded bumps at the start with MEETMEATTHECLUB and was off a step slowly,
chased the pace from the inside, ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied in the late stages and could not get to the winner at the end but was up in the final strides
for place. HONEYMOONZ OVER was asked for early speed and tracked the moderate pace through the turn, could not make up ground in the drive and
was outfinished, while just being edged out at the end for second. HANDSOME GARY chased the pace between rivals to the turn, came two wide to the
quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch but came on in the final sixteenth and improved position late. SAINT IVES was forwardly placed to the turn,
maintained position through the turn and into upper stretch, was asked for run while on the left lead in the final furlong and was outkicked late.
MEETMEATTHECLUB exchanged bumps at the start with COUNTING CARDS, trailed through the turn and lacked the needed late response. QUIET
CHARM came in tight soon after the break and steadied off of heels in the first furlong, was steered to go outside of rivals to the turn, came four then five
wide nearing the top of the stretch and did not produce a late rally.
