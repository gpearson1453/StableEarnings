the drive. G'S TURN stalked between horses, advanced outside final turn, rallied to be just up for the place. MR. DAZZLE stalked outside, went after the
winner into the stretch, couldn't get to that one, gave best in place bid, tired late. RAILSPLITTER broke on top, tracked leader inside, finished evenly.
GOLDENEYED, checking inside behind horses through the first turn, saved ground while never looking comfortable to the final turn, moved off the rail on
the turn, had nothing left for the drive. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR stalked widest, lacked a rally. WICKED FORTITUDE pressed outside, made a bid into the
final turn, was turned back, tired.
