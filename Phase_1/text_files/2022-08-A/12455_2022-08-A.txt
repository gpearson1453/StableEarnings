Footnotes
LADY MAEVE (IRE) tracked behind the pace just outside down the backstretch, engaged the leader outside at the quarter, was ridden hard battling for the
lead with a furlong to go and just held at the finish holding off two late closing runners. CARLA'S HONOR trailed in the early stages, started to advance
around runners at the three eighths pole, angled to the five path at the top of the stretch for a clear run and was full of run late just missing getting up at the
finish for the win. BODY OF LAW was off a bit slow to start, advanced on the rail through the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch four wide between
runners and was strong running to the wire getting third in a three horse photo. MOMMA CARRIE hustled after the break to take command, led through the
turn, was engaged by the winner in upper stretch and battled on the rail for an eighth before weakening very late nearing the wire. MIDNIGHT MEADOW
tracked inside in the early stages, was ridden into contention through the turn and levelled out inside down the stretch. MUMBLEBEE chased the early
speed just outside, was asked midway on the turn to go after the leader and faded between runners through the lane. POOLSIDE MANNERS stalked
outside mid pack through the backside, was asked for run on the turn and had nothing to offer in the stretch.

Footnotes
FRIENDS FOR LIFE moved forward from between runners early, pressed the pace while being kept wide into the turn, went three deep on that bend, struck
the lead at the three-sixteenths, kicked clear and held sway while being kept to the task. FORTYFIVESEVENTY raced between runners late up the
backstretch, eased back and shifted out near the three-eighths, swung five wide into the stretch, kept on to secure the place in a battle with SIXTH
ANNIVERSARY, who was urged along inside to a more forward position, saved ground on the turn, came out in upper stretch, was outfinished for second.
SILENT DIVA settled off the pace racing near but just off the inside, swung six wide into upper stretch and gained mildly. OLENA was forwardly-positioned
early, dropped back off the leading pair, went three wide on the turn, weakened gradually in the stretch. SOUPER SINCLAIR was unhurried early, swung
seven wide and gained mildly. ALBERTA BE MINE chased from outside going three wide on the turn, shifted in leaving that bend, failed to rally. BLONDE
DYNAMO broke a bit awkwardly and was slow to gather, failed to threaten. SOUPER SUNDAY set a pressured pace inside then gave way in upper stretch.
NEPRIKLAUSOMA DAMA was urged along from the break but lacking sufficient early speed, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
REMEMBERING RHODA broke mid pack on the rail down the backstretch, was coaxed entering the turn so she could get a good tracking position behind
the frontrunners, angled outside in the three path at the top of the stretch and closed well the final furlong to win drawing away at the wire. FOREST
CHOICE broke sharp to be in front early, surrendered the lead into the turn to track just outside, rebid to lead briefly at the eighth pole but could not hold off
a fast closing winner in the final seventy yards. DIXIEWISH tracked the early speed down the backside, took command through the turn on the rail, was
headed with a furlong to go, battled briefly and then gave way late to be a clear third. INFINITE PASSION was bumped after the break to trail for the first
half and showed some late interest moving well in mid stretch between runners to get a minor share at the finish. MIA'S AUTHORITY broke out on the start,
began to rally between rivals mid turn only to be steadied nearing the eighth pole and ran evenly afterwards to the finish. BAYSVILLE made a mild move
early in the turn while going widest and had little to offer in the stretch. LEGAL STEPS broke sharp, chased the pace on the outside for the first part, tracked
behind the frontrunners between foes on the turn and drifted in mid stretch while weakening through the lane. HONOR AND DIGNITY was away alertly,
chased the pace between runners through the backstretch, was shuffled back entering the turn and retreated inside through the stretch.

Footnotes
ALPHA MIA was reluctant to load, coaxed to the fore to set the pace, faced outside pressure into the turn, was engaged by a rival at the top of the stretch,
dueled with that one and dug in to prevail under steady handling. SYSTEMATIC stalked just off the leaders from outside, advanced three wide on the turn,
bid at the quarter pole, dueled the length of the stretch but was outfinished. HENRY'S GAMBLE tracked inside on or just off the rail, came out about four
wide at the three-sixteenths, gained steadily but too late. MEET THE SOPRANO was well-placed stalking in behind, moved out from three to four wide on
the turn coming into upper stretch five wide and looming a threat but evened out. ABSOLUTE JEWEL was hard to load, urged at the break but lacking
speed, saved ground inside, angled out leaving the turn then came out further in upper- to mid-stretch and ran on evenly. CLASSIC QUEEN settled off the
pace racing off the inside, swung seven wide for the drive and improved. TALK TO YA LATER was a bit reluctant to load, pressed the pace two wide, was
done about the five-sixteenths and faded. HI HONEY chased from between runners up the backstretch, angled in at the half while dropping back, failed to
rally. FIRST ROUND PICK chased outside going four to five wide on the turn, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
GOLDEN TRAIN broke sharp to lead, was headed by an outside rival with a quarter to go and dug in on the fence determinedly to hold the challenger off to
the wire. SOCIETY'S KAT tracked the winner throughout the turn, engaged that foe at the top of the stretch, drifted out with a furlong to go under left handed
urging and could not get past a stubborn leader through the lane. BEDAZZLE ME broke in brushing the gate at the start, rated near the back early,
commenced her rally mid turn advancing around runners going three wide, angled to the six path for the drive and closed well to be a clear third at the finish.
SECRET SUNSHINE rated behind the frontrunners stalking inside through the turn, angled out in the four path for the run down the stretch and offered a
mild rally between runners. AGENDA settled mid pack after the break, lost ground to rivals around the turn was asked with a quarter to go and ran evenly to
the finish. FLAT OUT ANGEL rated near the back after the start, was roused on the rail through the turn and never was a presence through the lane. MORE
GELATO was outside runners mid pack in the beginning, advanced three wide to contend on the turn and backed away through the field in the stretch. MY
GIRL GABBY chased inside through the backside, was roused to keep up to the pacesetters mid turn and offered no finish to the wire. FERDA broke
inwards hitting the gate at the start to trail and could never recover after that.

Footnotes
GIZALA (IRE) rated in behind the pace inside, raced on then just off the rail early on the turn, tipped out four wide about the five-sixteenths, took aim and
struck the lead past the three-sixteenths and kicked clear under moderate urging. VIVID VIXEN settled inside a rival off the leaders, came out four to five
wide at the top of the stretch, kicked on to get up for second over GAL WONDER (GB), who was in tight, steadied slightly and altered outside a rival as that
one shifted in, pressed the same rival into the turn going two to three wide, struck a narrow lead at the quarter pole, was overtaken past the
three-sixteenths, lost place late. SHE MAKES A POINT was coaxed clear from the start, shifted in to dictate terms on or just off the rail, had no extra for the
lane. MISS MARIE settled outside a foe stalking just off the leaders and going two wide into the turn, swung out five to six wide for the stretch run and within
striking distance but evened out. BEQUIA trailed early racing off the inside, was asked for more near the half-mile marker, was never near enough to
threaten.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S BIT tracked the early speed inside through the backstretch, waited on the turn behind the pacesetters looking for room, darted up the fence turning
for home and took over at the eighth pole and was beginning to widen at the wire. FOREST VIXEN tracked the dueling frontrunners down the backstretch,
loomed four wide through the far turn, assumed command at the top of the stretch and could not hold off a fast closing inside rival in the last sixteenth. DOO
DAH was allowed to settle near the rear down the backstretch, roused on far the turn, angled out to the six path for the drive and showed late interest
passing tiring rivals on the outside to get up for third money. LIVIN ON LUV pressed the pace from the onset going three wide on both turns, contended
turning for home and stalled at the eighth pole. SONET'S NAME took command entering the first turn but was hounded by two outside rivals for the first half,
began to inch away from the pace challengers at the quarter pole then surrendered the lead to two tracking closers in upper stretch and weakened inside
with a sixteenth to go. TENPENNY NAIL trailed early and never threatened. TOTAL BETTY was between rivals pressing for the lead for the first five eighths,
began to weaken with a quarter to go and backed away through the lane. GOLDEN SUZIE settled near the back after the start and could not get involved
throughout the race. KOTO took an awkward step entering the first turn, was pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
SOUPER HOITY TOITY settled into stride off the pace racing outside, went mostly three wide on the turn, was given mild hand-encouragement about the
three-eighths, asked for more by the quarter pole, moved out a bit in mid-stretch lightly brushing a rival, gained steadily to just get up late over VERGARA,
who stalked the leaders early, advanced three to four wide on the turn, came in a bit while engaging the leader at the top of the stretch, had a narrow lead
about the three-sixteenths, dueled in the stretch, outfinished the sparring partner to inch away late but could not hold off the winner. LADYWEARSTHERING
quickly moved to the lead willingly and shifted in, set the pace inside just off the rail, was engaged at the top of the stretch, dueled till late then yielded
grudgingly. LOVE TO RUN pressed early inside then eased back content to track, saved ground on the turn, was all out in the lane and angled out late while
securing a minor award. READY LADY settled between rivals, went two to three wide on the turn, moved out a path in the stretch to following the eventual
winner, kept on to improve position from between runners. GUILEFUL moved forward to press the leader two to three deep after the opening quarter,
couldn't keep pace in the stretch while drifting in and out just a bit, steadied nearing the wire when in tight. EPHRATA (GB) settled off the pace inside,
shifted four wide gradually coming past the five-sixteenths, was brushed lightly in mid-stretch and in turn lightly brushed another foe, evened out in the lane.
AMAZIN QUEEN raced well off the pace, fanned five wide into the stretch, was brushed lightly in mid-stretch and lacked the needed late kick. MRS.
BARBARA raced inside while dropping back, came out turning for home, failed to rally.

Footnotes
DANCE WITH DESTINY tracked the early speed after the break, began to close the gap on the leader through the turn, easily took command at the quarter
pole and opened up when asked mid stretch to win comfortably at the end. SAREEHA (IRE) stalked outside in third at the three eighths pole, roused
midway on the turn to follow the winner, offered a brief bid with a quarter to go but was repelled quickly and could not offer a threat for the winner through
the lane. WARWOMAN stalked on the rail mid pack early, was ridden to keep up on the turn with the leaders, angled out to the three path for the drive and
finished evenly to be a distant third. MARDENE was outside of runners four wide down the backside, angled inside to the rail with two furlongs to go and
split tiring runners in late stretch to get a small share at the finish. ASTONISH rated near the back inside down the backstretch, offered a brief run between
foes in the turn but could not get involved for the run to the wire. CATCH MAGIC broke sharp to be on top, was unchallenged up front down the backstretch,
surrendered the lead with a quarter to go and backed through the field down the lane. CHARLOTTE'S SILVER broke well to be mid pack between runners
down the backstretch, was ridden through the turn on the outside of horses and drifted in briefly in upper stretch while tiring. WELL ACTUALLY trailed early
and never reached contention.

Footnotes
RETAIL THERAPIST was up close inside early then settled into stride off the pace racing inside, shifted five wide coming past the five-sixteenths, struck the
lead at the three-sixteenths, kicked clear and held sway under stout urging. KIMONO KATE was forwardly positioned outside, began to edge clear about the
five-eighths, went two to three wide on the turn, was clear turning for home, overtaken in upper stretch, kept on but was only second best. HIGH TREASON
lacked early speed racing well back, shifted five wide into upper stretch, brushed with a rival lightly, ran along for show. ZIPPITY DAY raced mid-pack
between runners early then outside three to four wide on the turn, kept on evenly. KNOW HOW (GB) had early speed inside but eased back off a pair and
switched out then advanced from outside three to four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. TARA LUNA raced toward the back off the inside in
about the four path through the turn swinging seven wide into upper stretch, ran on with mild late interest. BITTERSWEETBIZNESS was urged at the break
contending between rivals then pressed from inside a foe but off the fence, continued to chase in behind heading to the top of the stretch, shifted out a path
at that juncture then back in, weakened. KEYSTONE LAW settled off the pace inside, shifted three wide into upper stretch, brushed just lightly with a foe,
failed to rally. SHEZ A SEALY broke outwardly, raced outside four to six wide, failed to rally. DONNARUMMA chased between runners two to three wide,
weakened in the stretch. LOADED SECRET dropped back from between runners three to five wide on the turn, exchanged a light brush in upper stretch,
failed to menace. HIT ME UP was up close early racing inside on or just off the rail, steadily retreated.
