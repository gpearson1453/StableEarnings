a tangle, rushed up between foes, steadied off heels entering the turn, raced in range three wide and finished willingly between foes. VIGIL ANNA prompted
the pace five wide, vied outside through the lane and just missed second. MARILYN set the pace in the two path to midstretch and was outfinished.

MY CAJUN LADY set the pace along the rail, drew off around the turn, widened under a drive to the sixteenth pole and continued to extend the margin
under minimal urging in the final sixteenth. ASTONISHING ANABEL was bumped at the start, had speed between foes, steadied near the half-mile pole,
raced two wide between foes around the turn and kept on inside to gain the place in the final strides. ATTHECROSSROADS prompted the winner two wide,
could not keep pace with that foe and lost second late. SKIP TO MY LUTE came in and bumped ASTONISHING ANABEL at the start, had early speed
between, dropped back under urging two wide around the turn and passed tiring rivals in the lane. MOON ROSE chased the pace three wide and came up
empty in the lane. VAI VIA was outrun inside. MISS UCRANIA played no factor while racing four wide.

Footnotes
GRAN SLASH set a pressured pace in the two path, drew clear nearing the quarter pole and continued to widen under a drive. NATIONAL UNITY settled off
the early pace outside, raced four wide around the turn, stayed on outside of foes and was up for the place in the final strides. NO NAME DUDE pressed the
winner from the three path, could not keep pace from the five-sixteenths pole and lost second in the final strides. MY EAGLE SOARS stalked the early pace
and steadily faded two wide. MR. ASH failed to menace while racing three wide. SALUTE THE TROOPS was soundly bumped at the start and never in
contention while racing two wide. THE KHOZAN ONE bumped hard with SALUTE THE TROOPS at the start, raced two wide and played no further factor.
SEAX hesitated at the start and was outrun inside.

ASSERTIKO set a rated pace inside, edged clear in upper stretch and dug in late to just last. WIND NINETY NINE broke awkwardly and slowly, rushed up
between foes, raced in range two and three wide, steadily gained through the lane and just missed. NOBLE EMPIRE pressed the winner two wide and was
outfinished between the top two finishers in the lane. KHOZY MY BOY tracked the pace three and four wide and lacked the needed rally. BELLA FUTURE
was outrun in the four path.

R ADMIRAL stalked the pace in the three path, took over late on the far turn while still three wide, drifted out several times in the stretch, forcing out KING
SILVIO multiple times and held that foe at bay. KING SILVIO settled off the early pace inside, advanced four wide around the far turn, had aim outside of R
ADMIRAL in upper stretch, was herded out multiple times by that foe in the lane and kept trying throughout. RACKET advanced in the four path around the
first turn, cleared off fairly early on the backstretch, set the pace two wide around the far turn, battled to midstretch and weakened. MUTARAAFEQ set the
pace along the rail around the first turn, chased inside down the backstretch and around the far turn and faded through the lane. NIC'S BRO played no
factor while racing two wide. INCULPABLE trailed throughout. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF KING SILVIO, R
ADMIRAL WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

SHES ALL WOMAN settled off the early pace, bid three wide nearing the three-eighths pole, took over leaving the five-sixteenths marker and drew off under
moderate urging. DEM A WONDER contested the pace in the four path down the backstretch, vied two wide between foes around much of the turn, could
not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on to be a clear second. BION MAGIC was in range while racing two and three wide, lacked a rally
but was along for the show. FOXY LADY failed to menace while racing four wide. SIMPLIFY (ARG) set the early pace along the rail and tired after a half.
LET'S BE HONEST played no factor while racing three wide.
