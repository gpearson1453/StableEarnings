Footnotes
FLIT N FLOT TIME a bit restless in the gate, broke with the leaders, closest to the pacesetter toward the inside, began to move on that one in the far turn,
took over entering the stretch, drew out steadily through the lane under steady encouragement. TOUGH START away in good order, settled outside, chased
the two leaders into the far turn, closer with a quarter to run, long drive for the second spot off the inside, proved game for that position, no match winner.
DARK MATTER took over early in the first turn, continued to set the pace along the inside up the backstretch and into the far turn, offered brief resistance to
the winner exiting that final bend, held stubbornly before relinquishing the place late. BARNEY'S PASSION lacked early foot, went one paced throughout,
improved slightly while never a threat to the top three. CHARLIE'S STAR dwelt at the break to spot the field several lengths, trailed early while feeling a right
handed crop, advanced with a middle move along the inside into the far turn, flattened out through the stretch to lose the fourth spot late. HEZA BREEZIN
was finished early, reported home far back.

Footnotes
TRAELEE stalked the dueling leaders up the backstretch just off the inside, advanced on that pair with three furlongs remaining three wide, roused late in
the turn when holding a slight advantage, extended duel to the wire while under vigorous right handed crop, drew clear late under continued brisk handling.
UNBRIDLED HOPE broke alertly, narrowly showed the way out of the chute, dueled up the backstretch and into the far turn, put the other early speed away
just as the winner came alongside soon after, dueled past the furlong marker, proved stubborn until late, saved the place. POLICY LIMIT away well, dueled
up inside the runner up for a half, fell back, moved out for the drive, coming back for the second spot late, this time outside that rival. AMBASSADOR
HOUSE in mid pack early off the inside, swung out six wide turning for home, failed to muster a rally down the middle of the strip. K T'S JILTED GROOM
last away, raced back, made little impact in the drive after saving ground through the turn. CLEVER PRINCE trailed throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
DRIED PEPPER broke on top, showed the way into the first turn, continued to set a soft pace for a half, vied into the lane, shook clear when straightened for
home, responded when challenged late and dug in the final few yards to narrowly prevail in determined fashion. GENTRIFIED bothered at the start to be
last away, settled off the early pace, advanced to challenge three wide second turn, lost some ground and fell back off the winner into upper stretch, roused,
came back and lodged a second bid in the late going, missed. COMMON LAW CAT tracked the pace along the inside, crept a bit closer while continuing to
save ground through the second turn, in good striking position entering the stretch, lacked a winning response while prevailing for the show. GREELEY'S
DEALER four wide in to the first turn, dueled outside the winner up the backstretch, vied between the top two through the second bend then began to
weaken when the real running began at the head of the lane. PINCH ASSAULT fell back to trail after the start, raced four wide into the far turn when
attempting to advance, went flat through the stretch to finish up evenly. TRIVISTA broke out to bother the runner up, raced in mid pack, was finished after
five furlongs.

BATTLE OF WILL within striking distance early three wide, moved closer before a half while remaining outside, vied in the three path through the final turn,
kicked steadily clear through the lane while kept to pressure. CHIEF KIMOSABI chased the early leader, engaged that one between foes and inside the
winner before a half, continued to vie between horses through the second turn, proved no match for the winner through the stretch, stayed on preserve the
runner up spot. WOODS N WATER broke on top, got clear early and to the inside, continued to set the pace up the backstretch, headed second turn,
gradually weakened through the lane but managed to gain the nod for the show. SY MICHAEL in the second flight inside, angled out three wide late in the
final turn, bothered slightly when the runner up drifted out in upper stretch, finished up evenly to miss the show. NORTHERNREFLECTION last to leave,
trailed in the second flight off the inside, three wide second turn, had nothing for the drive.

JANETS JAY JAY with the pace from the start, dueled through much of the turn in the two path, shook clear into the lane, expanded that advantage past the
furlong marker and won geared down to be ridden out. BIND FAITH last away, trailed early out of the chute in hand, moved closer along the inside into the
turn, asked midway on the bend, came two wide for the drive, clearly second best while not a serious threat to the winner. DREWMAZING in the second
flight while racing outside, came four wide out of the turn, lacked a serious response through the lane while well clear of the others. GRUNT broke on top,
narrowly showed the way up the backstretch closest to the rail, dueled inside the winner turn, faltered through the stretch. JUSTA BUSTER moved up to
press the issue early from between foes, began a steady retreat after three furlongs. ORDER UP fell back to trail before a quarter, showed little in reporting
home far back.

PACIFICISLANDTIME with the pace closest to but not on the inside after breaking in good order, dueled the middle half while continuing in the two path,
shook clear entering the stretch and maintained daylight to the wire while being kept to task. FOOLISH DREAMS broke out to carry ALL MIKE NO MAE
outward, vied between rivals through the first turn, raced the second flight up the backstretch, knifed through an opening in the three path turning for home
but proved no match for the winner in the run to the wire, clearly second best. GENERAL EISENHOWER with the pace while between rivals and
immediately outside the winner early first turn, shuffled back onto the backstretch to trail, went evenly to the wire the final three furlongs to improve only
slightly, no threat to the top pair. ALL MIKE NO MAE carried out at the start, with the leaders while in the five path early first turn, dueled up the backstretch
and into the far turn outside the winner, gave way in the drive, lost the nod for the third position at the wire.

A WISH FOR MADELYN broke in to bother J Z'S FIRST slightly, was straightened to narrowly show the way out of the chute, dueled up the backstretch and
into the turn, shook off the other speed when straightened for home, stayed clear to the wire under steady handling. SUFFRAGETTE forwardly placed off
the inside, three wide into the lane, drew clear for the runner up position while not seriously menacing for the win. J Z'S FIRST bothered at the start to be
last away, continued to trail into and through the turn, rallied through some traffic to be up for the show, not a threat to the top two. BE A BANDIT broke well,
dueled with the winner outside that one up the backstretch and through the turn, began to falter entering the stretch, continued to weaken to lose the show
spot late. HOLY WAR lacked speed off the inside, fanned six wide by LUCKY LINDA into the stretch, brushed with that one and finished up evenly in lacking
a closing punch. LUCKY LINDA off the pace and the inside, swung five wide into the lane, brushed with HOLY WAR in upper stretch and failed to rally.
GILDED APPLE broke alertly, steadily faded and trailed home. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF J Z'S FIRST AGAINST THE WINNER
FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION.
