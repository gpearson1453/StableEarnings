Footnotes
BAM BAM CAM rated on the front end from outside, edged ahead while just off the inside taking the bend, was let out leaving the turn, received mild urging
inside the last furlong and maintained full control. YABA DABA DOO shared the early lead from inside, angled outside BAM BAM CAM into the turn, lacked
the extra needed in the lane but was unchallenged for second. POP CULTURE bumped with W W RUSSIAN GOLD at the break, was prominent early, lost
ground staying outside YABA DABA DOO through the bend, failed to have a significant stretch bid and narrowly held onto the show. W W RUSSIAN GOLD
bumped at the start, chased from inside, gained a striking position along the rail on the turn then leveled off for the stretch run. HELLOFAGUY chased from
between horses, was two wide through the bend and had no late bid. PENALTY SHOT was a step slow at the break, three to five wide taking the turn and
could only make up minor ground the final furlong. BEL BIMBO chased from between horses, was widest taking the bend and could only make up minor
ground deep stretch.

Footnotes
MIKE'S LADY was kept close outside the leaders, roused three wide on the second turn, engaged BOWS N LACE nearing the final sixteenth, battled on
even terms the rest of the way and got the nod at the wire. BOWS N LACE advanced to share the lead outside TEMRIK on the backstretch, edged ahead
early in the second bend, fought to keep her advantage in the lane but was narrowly outfinished in a game effort. PRESENT OF HERO without early speed,
progressed just off the inside on the second turn, advanced from inside upper stretch, altered out for a clear path inside the last furlong, angled inside
BOWS N LACE deep stretch, was too late but clearly best of the others. HOLD THE SPENDING raced in contention toward the outside, angled in with a
half mile left, was two wide taking the second bend, began to yield leaving that turn, altered out when PRESENT OF HERO came out inside the furlong
marker and continued to gradually fade. TEMRIK broke alertly, was quickly clear, challenged from outside on the backstretch, did not stay with BOWS N
LACK after a half mile and flatened out the last eighth. RUBY ROUND HERE failed to menace in a wide trip. SATIATE moved to the inside on the first bend
and gave way before finishing six furlongs.

Footnotes
WILDWOODS DREAM progressed just off the inside into the bend, waited for room, got through two wide entering the lane, took the lead upper stretch then
steadily opened up while kept to task to the waning yards. SEATTLESWAY prompted the pace from outside, jostled with MEMPHIS THEPROPHET from
midway on the backstretch until near the turn, was three to four wide taking the bend and took over second deep stretch. UNCLE O. G. set the pace from
inside, could not hold back WILDWOODS DREAM in the lane and began to wear down in the late going. THACKER FROMM chased four or five wide
throughout and lacked a significant stretch bid. ANUNKA pressed UNCLE O. G. from just outside, floated out some into the stretch, flattened out, fell on the
track from heat exhaustion after the race, was revived and walked off. SMOOTH ATTACK was bumped and forced in some at the break then failed to
menace in a ground-saving trip. MEMPHIS THEPROPHET helped prompt the early pace while in tight quarters between rivals, jostled with SEATTLESWAY
from midway on the backstretch to nearing the bend, retreated three wide on the turn and continued to fade through the lane. WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR
broke inward, bumped solidly with SMOOTH ATTACK, soon trailed, had the rail on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run but had little to offer.
RETURN OF PREMIUM hesitated at the start and was never a factor.

Footnotes
RENEGADE BOB soon shared the lead outside CITY POSITION, dueled that one in the lane and slowly edged ahead inside the last furlong. CITY
POSITION contested the pace from inside, fought gamely through the stretch but slowly wore down inside the final eighth. TALE OF THE NILE prominent
toward the outside, lost ground four then five wide taking the turn and could only hold his position late. AGAVE KID broke slowly and inward, was corrected
and taken to the outside, lost considerable ground widest through the bend, made a strong move the final eighth but was too late. GONZO chased from just
off the inside, closed the gap some on the turn, came into the stretch behind RENEGADE BOB, altered out slightly midstretch, was all out in the late going
but did not have enough in the waning yards. FRONTANA toward the outside early, followed just outside GONZO through the bend and also lacked the
extra needed deep stretch. STACCATO failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. Due to excessive whipping by his rider, GONZO was disqualified by the
stewards and left unplaced for all but pari-mutuel purposes.

Footnotes
SYMBOLIST gradually angled toward the outside on the backstretch, was roused three wide on the second bend, fanned out further entering the lane,
engaged THE LAST OPTION approaching the furlong marker, lugged in under right-handed pressure with a sixteenth left, was straightened and edged
ahead after that. THE LAST OPTION lost ground five wide through the first turn, angled toward the inside with a half mile to go, came into contention along
the rail on the second bend, rallied to vie for the lead through the stretch, did not have enough left the final sixteenth but was clearly second best.
TURBINADO fractious in the gate, was withdrawn, received an okay from the veterinarian and a saddle adjustment, was reloaded, prominent just outside
LONESOME DREAM once the race began, vied for the lead on the second turn then could not sustain his bid in the lane. LONESOME DREAM moved clear
on the backstretch, was challenged from outside on the second turn, floated out some entering the lane and gradually wore down. PINEDALE chased in
midpack while toward the outside, was three wide taking the second bend, lugged in upper stretch, crowding SUPER SILVER and angled to the far outside
nearing the last sixteenth. SUPER SILVER chased from inside or just off the rail, began to close the gap some upper stretch, was crowded by PINEDALE at
that point and leveled off in the late going. CONCRETE FINISHER showed little.

W W HOTSHOT was bumped and forced into KHOZAN'S VALENTINE at the start, shared the lead from inside, floated out some as he moved clear
entering the stretch then held on under steady handling. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE was bumped just after the break, his rider lost his irons but regained his
footing before finishing the first sixteenth of a mile, was altered out for a clear path after passing the five-furlong marker, took the turn three wide, gained
second with seventy yards to go and came up short for the win. W W CANDY hesitated then made a small jump a few strides from the gate, was taken to
the outside after leaving the chute, lost ground four wide through the bend and found best stride too late deep stretch. HUEY ATTACK bore inward at the
break, bumping solidly with W W HOTSHOT, disputed the pace outside that one, did not keep up leaving the turn, moved to the inside for a clear path at the
top of the lane and slowly yielded.

TONYS MORNING LINE bumped with LAKE MILLS at the break, was kept close from outside, went for the lead five wide on the turn, moved clear leaving
the bend and angled in some then drew away from the rest while kept to urging until nearing the wire. LAKE MILLS was pinched briefly at the start,
prompted the early pace from outside, was boxed in on the turn, got through five wide with two furlongs to go, his rider lost his whip at the top of the lane,
angled in some under hand urging midstretch and gained second with a sixteenth of a mile left. JACK VAN BERG disputed the pace from inside, was no
match for TONYS MORNING LINE when set down for the drive and gradually wore down inside the last furlong. ART HEIST away somewhat slowly,
advanced from inside on the turn, progressed just off the rail in the lane, floated out some midstretch and was closing in for third late. RIDE INTO THE SKY
broke inward bumping R H SMOAKEM, was hustled along from between rivals, angled out through the turn, came widest into the stretch and passed tired
ones the final eighth. MY LITTLE TIPSY vied for the early lead two wide, did not keep up leaving the bend, swung out entering the stretch and faded
between rivals. R H SMOAKEM bumped just after the break, contested the pace three wide for a half mile then gave way. FROSTED PRAYER broke
