Footnotes
DR CHAPPELL took a good tracking position going into the far turn, was asked to go after a loose leader at the three eighths pole and was determined
through the stretch wearing down his rival to just get up nearing the finish. UNSPEAKABLE broke sharp to lead leaving the chute, was unchallenged
through the backstretch and turn, fought on stubbornly through the lane and was collared just nearing the wire. OWEN'S SOUPER MOON stalked mid pack
between horses early, commenced a run with a fellow rival to his outside through the turn and was closing belatedly through the stretch on the top two all
the while on the wrong lead. CRUMLIN EXPERIENCE took to an outside stalking position down the backside, offered a mild rally going three wide on turn
while running with a fellow competitor to his inside and stalled in the final eighth while holding for a minor share. HEY MICKEY trailed after the break, was
asked for run inside entering the turn, offered no response and passed a faltering runner down the lane. MAGIC CONQUEST hopped slightly on the break,
chased the pace through the backstretch while inside, retreated on the rail with three eighths to go and stopped through the stretch.

Footnotes
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH was outpaced early, raced outside foes into the turn going three then four wide on that bend, swung seven wide into upper stretch,
was carried out a bit by a drifting rival, kept on with a steady bid to get up late. MY BABY JANE attended the pace from between rivals, put a short head in
front just past the quarter pole, maintained a small advantage till late and was outfinished. SHE MAKES ME TIZZY attended the pace from outside three to
four wide, lacked the needed late kick and held show honors. WANT TO GO DANCING exchanged bumps on both sides at the start, moved forward four
wide heading to the turn, swung out six deep leaving the bend, drifted out and in a bit in the stretch and ran on evenly. PICTUREDAY JESSICA bumped
with a rival at the start, dropped back to the rear shortly after, saved ground inside on the turn, came out two to three wide for the stretch and kicked on
mildly. ELUSIVE GEM was encouraged along early, moved up inside rivals to vie for the lead, weakened in the stretch. LAILA'S CHARM exchanged a bump
at the start and was urged along chasing in behind the leaders two to three wide, came five wide into upper stretch then angled outside foes past the
sixteenth pole but had no real rally. SILENTANDDISCREET was a bit reluctant to load, broke awkwardly and a couple lengths slowly, raced at the back off
the inside and was never able to menace. FREE CARRYCOMB chased from inside and came up empty.

Footnotes
BURNING MAN stalked outside of runners through the first turn and backstretch, being well back from a torrid pace, was patiently handled on the far turn
angling in to the rail at the quarter pole, quickly darted up the fence to contend for the lead entering the stretch and drew away with a furlong to go winning
comfortably in the end. MNEMBA ISLAND stalked between runners for the first three quarters of a mile, waited to pounce on the pace through the far turn
on the outside, took command while three wide at the top of the stretch and was outkicked in the last eighth running well to be a clear second. REDOUTE'S
LIGHT was allowed to settle at the back in the early stages, saved ground through the backstretch, began to rally with three eighths to go and finished with
some good late energy on the rail through the stretch to get up for the show award. COLEYVILLE was near the rear in the beginning, advanced inside of
runners through the first turn, tracked the pacesetter with four furlongs to go, took command midway on the far turn, was headed by runners on both sides
turning for home and stalled in the final furlong. HIATUS took command right after the start, opened up early under the wire for the first time, continued to
set solid fractions down the backside to increase his lead with a half to go, was swallowed up by the field mid far turn and was not persevered with through
the lane and was eased just after the wire.

Footnotes
VALLEY GIRL settled in behind the leaders along the inside, came out two wide on the turn to pass a rival, bid inside foes in late stretch edged past inside
the final seventy yards. ONEZY'S DREAM stalked in behind the leaders going three to four wide on the turn, struck the lead briefly just outside the sixteenth
pole and was outfinished. FIVE DAYS IN MAY got away from the gate slowly, settled at the rear shifting in, swung six wide leaving the turn, ran on for show
honors. CRUMLIN TIME was mid-pack outside up the backstretch, angled in three wide just before entering the turn, swung out seven deep leaving that
bend, ran on. AIRY FAIRY attended the pace from outside three wide into the turn and taking the lead about the seven-sixteenths, was clear three furlongs
out and into mid-stretch but lacked the needed late kick. ORBALINE pursued the pace four wide, was encouraged along late on the turn, failed to rally.
CEFALO was urged forward inside showing brief speed to dictate terms but was soon overtaken and steadily weakened. GLOVANNA raced off the inside at
the back and was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
A MAIZE ZING DOTIE had a good tracking position from the onset, waited inside on the turn behind the pacesetter looking for room, found a seam in the
two path at the top of the lane and gamely split runners mid way through the stretch and was inching away at the finish line. BIG GINGER was away alertly
to lead, opened up going into the turn on the fence, dug in gamely entering the stretch on the rail fighting off one rival early only to be challenged by the
winner nearing the wire and could not fend off that one late. SUGAR IS GOLDEN chased outside in the early stages, loomed into contention turning for
home while three wide, led briefly outside of foes with and eighth to go and stalled in the final sixteenth giving up the top two placings. KHOZZY VALINTINE
trailed early, was roused going four wide throughout the turn, ran on between rivals entering the stretch and got up to for a small share at the finish. IS
THERE A FOREST stalked inside early on, was roused between runners through the turn and could not offer a rally running to the wire. VOLATA broke
inwards to start, stalked outside mid pack down the backstretch, moved around runners four wide with three eighths to go to contend turning for home and
was one paced the last furlong. SUPER LEGGERA was near the back leaving the chute, tried to advance inside through the turn, got shuffled back to trail
and was not a factor down the lane.

Footnotes
BOSSALINA stalked from outside off the leading pair, went three to four wide on the turn coming five wide into upper stretch, struck the lead near the
furlong marker, was soon clear and held well under moderate urging. BORN TO BE GOOD was allowed to settle racing off the pace, saved ground on the
turn coming out two to three wide at the top of the stretch, kept on but was only second best. CARELESS HEIRESS set a pressured pace inside, weakened
in the stretch. WHAT A BEAUT was outside off the pace going three to five wide on the turn and encouraged along a bit about the five-sixteenths, came into
upper stretch five to six wide and ran on. UNDER THE EYE tracked in behind the leading pair near inside, went two then three wide on the turn coming four
wide into upper stretch and briefly within striking distance but flattened out. SPEAK ENGLISH pressed from outside two wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
TEXT ME UP settled nicely just outside the pacesetter down the backstretch, engaged the leader with three eighths to go and began to open up in mid
stretch and was kept to the task through to the wire while winning comfortably. SAN NICOLA STAR hopped at the break, was between runners going into
the first turn mid pack, began advancing around foes at the three eighths pole while four wide and closed well outside to be a clear non threatening second.
PIPESTONE tracked inside just behind the pace early, rated kindly down the backside tracking the frontrunners, was ridden hard at the quarter pole to keep
up and could only finish with some late interest to get up late for third. SAMURAI FIGHTER showed speed going into the first turn, continued to lead on the
rail down the backside, was headed by the winner entering the far turn, battled inside through the turn giving away at the three sixteenths pole and faded on
the fence in the late stages to hold for a minor award. CALL ME KITTY stalked three wide into the first turn, was roused outside chasing the frontrunners
mid way through the far turn, loomed into contention for the stretch run and levelled out at the furlong marker. MUSKOKA LADY stalked mid pack on the rail
for most of the race, angled out through the stretch to offer a rally but was one paced down the lane. IVY'S STAR was near the back in the beginning, was
asked to go after runners with three eighths to go and had no bid. MAMITA'S CHICA trailed after the start, was ridden into the far turn and could not get into
contention.

Footnotes
VIVIAN ANN bumped with a rival at the start, tracked in behind the leaders just off the rail, found room between rivals near the furlong marker, struck the
lead and was soon clear then held under steady handling. REINS OF PURPLE settled off the pace, went four wide on the turn, was guided six deep in
upper stretch, gained belatedly to just get up for second. MOON POOL settled outside mid-pack, began to advance four then five wide on the turn, bid
outside in upper stretch, lost place late. CLIFF'S HEAD exchanged a bump at the start, was well-positioned stalking off the leading pair, went three then four
wide on the turn, bid in upper stretch but was outkicked. FLASHY GET EVEN set the pace inside with moderate pressure from an outside rival, came off the
fence turning for home, was outkicked. WANNA PLAY broke a step slowly, raced at the back off the inside, moved to the rail entering the turn, advanced
inside foes then ran on evenly. SHESALOOSECANNON pressed the pace two to three wide, came up empty for the drive. SUNDAY VISIT exchanged a
bump at the start, was ridden along early, went three wide on the turn, dropped back and was not persevered with late. CHANCEWORTHTAKING chased
two wide into the turn, pulled up and walked off.
