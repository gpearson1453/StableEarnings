Footnotes
FLIPPING FISH chased on the inside, moved up inside on the turn, angled out passing the quarter pole, rallied outside of BAILEY, dueled with that rival,
gained a short lead and prevailed under a drive. BAILEY off a step slow, rushed up inside to set the pace, dueled with the winner passing the furlong
marker, dug in gamely inside and battled to the end. LOVE NEST bumped at the start and steadied, raced two wide off the pace, moved up on the turn,
rallied mildly in the two path and earned the show spot. HIZAAM raced off the pace, had an inside trip and rallied mildly on the rail. HOT AND HEAVY
chased two wide, came three wide into the lane, lacked a bid and weakened. CLIFFY raced three wide off the pace, came three wide into the lane and failed
to threaten. HIGH FIVE COTTON was bumped at the start, chased two wide, came three wide into the lane and faded. MR. BANYAN raced three wide off
the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
BIRD RULER set the pace on the inside, dueled with RISK VS REWARD on the far turn, battled back gamely inside of that rival in midstretch and inched
away late, driving. RISK VS REWARD pressed the pace, bid on the far turn, dueled with BIRD RULER, gained a short lead, dug in gamely outside in the
stretch run and was outfinished. LUDO broke in bumping a rival at the start, stalked three wide, chased two wide on the far turn and finished evenly.
KNIGHT OFTHE CROWN raced off the pace inside, checked when lacking room at the three eighths marker, then moved up on the turn and closed
belatedly for fourth. MELINA'S DREAM tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and had no rally. KING FORCE tracked two wide, chased inside
on the far turn and tired. YAH HUH was bumped at the start and steadied, raced four wide on the first turn, stalked four wide, chased three wide on the far
turn and tired. VISION BOARD raced between rivals on the first turn, continued two wide off the pace and did not factor. SUPER SHOES raced off the rail,
off the pace and did not factor.
