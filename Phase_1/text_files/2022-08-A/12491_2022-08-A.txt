Footnotes
DENNY M delayed the start while reluctant to load, bobbled out of the gate in front, set all the pace, got out through the stretch and drew off late past mid
track. BUCKITITLEWAVE chased the winner two wide, dropped inside and finished second best along the rail. NEVANS with the second flight two wide,
finished evenly in the six path. PLATE IT UP pressured the winner along the inside early then faded in the stretch. KOLE MAN CAN failed to menace.
MOBIL AT LAST was never close.

SWINDLE rushed to the lead two wide before a quarter, set the balance of the pace and finished full of run under strong urging to win going away.
BISCAYNE BAY stalked the early pace, loomed boldly two wide nearing the quarter pole, drifted to the seven path then was no match for the winner. BEST
OF YOU trailed into the stretch then found her best stride late in the four path. KIST failed to menace. GRAZIA WHO led briefly along the rail and was
through after a half. EASTER PRIDE well placed, failed to respond.
