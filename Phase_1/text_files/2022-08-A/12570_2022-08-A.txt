Footnotes
STEAL HOME away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of BLACK
METAL in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, repelled the challenge from his pace rival in mid stretch and was all out to hold off a late
surge by PARKER POINT to prevail. PARKER POINT unhurried early while dropping well behind the field entering the lane the first time, bided his time at
the back of the pack in the run down the backside, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed
with a rush two out from the rail in deep stretch to just miss. BLACK METAL broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of STEAL HOME in the
run to the second turn, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with his
pace rival in mid stretch and was outfinished late. SMART LAD tracked the dueling leaders through the second turn while saving ground at the rail, rallied
two wide through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon late. HE'S RELENTLESS tracked the leaders through the stretch
the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained his position while continuing three wide through the final turn, and faded in the late stages.

ABOVE AVERAGE rushed up from the outside of MILO'S COMMAND to set the pace from along the rail entering the backstretch, opened a clear
advantage in the run to the final turn, continued to increase her lead through the final turn, and widened that lead through the lane under intermittent urging.
TEX TONIC stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, advanced three wide midway down the backside to keep in contention,
rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to get up for the place. FORCE TO REKN WITH stalked the leader into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, advanced four wide in the run to the final turn, continued three wide through the turn, and finished four wide in
the drive to garner a share. BLACKSTONE away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, continued two wide into
the final turn, but was outfinished over the final furlong. TROPICAL NIKKI trailed the filed into the backstretch, rallied from just off the rail entering the final
turn, and finished three out from the rail in deep stretch while finishing with late interest. MILO'S COMMAND away alertly, and stalked the clear leader in the
run down the backstretch, but began to weaken entering the final turn, and had little to offer late.

SILARONE settled off the early pacesetters while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly two out from the rail through
the rail through the final turn, and finished determinedly three wide in the drive to be up in the closing strides. MATSQUI away alertly and tracked the leader
into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, assumed command entering the lane, and just failed to last.
CHI CHI'S SONG broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and
closed willingly from along the inside in the stretch drive in a solid effort. WELLSLEY tracked the leader from just off the rail entering the backstretch, rallied
two wide through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. BETTER WITH TIME unhurried early while dropping back to trail,
saved ground through the final turn, but was only able to pass a tiring rival late while finishing four wide in the drive. LILSISTERLEE away well and raced to
the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn,
and faded late.

JUST JIMMY broke sharply and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run
down the backstretch and through the final turn, got the better of a very stubborn WHISKEY TALK late and inched clear nearing the wire to prove best.
WHISKEY TALK away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of JUST JIMMY in the run
down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival late, and just failed to last. BOITANO settled off the early pace
while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, saved ground through the second turn to race into a tracking trip entering the backstretch,
rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed determinedly one out from the rail in deep stretch to finish on even terms with WHISKEY TALK. FLORIDA
GATOR away alertly and tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while being held out three wide, continued with a wide trip in the run down the
backside and through the final turn, and was unable to make a late impact while finishing four wide in the drive. PRINCE CAIRO stalked the leaders through
the stretch the first time while racing three out from the rail, dropped back to trail in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, but
failed to make a serious late impact while finishing five wide in the drive. EDDIE WHO stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving
ground at the rail, raced into a tracking trip from between rivals in the run to the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. The
one mile split for this race was unavailable at the time of writing.

PRETTY ARIA away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, pressed the leader two wide in the run to the
final turn, battled through the turn from the outside of ARIKARA through the turn, and got the better of her pace rival late in a game effort. REA MEA stalked
the leader into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive
to get up for the place in the final strides. ARIKARA away well and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the backstretch, battled from the inside of
PRETTY ARIA through the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on that rival late, and just failed to hold the place. FLORAL dwelt at the start to get away
poorly, settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished with
late interest four wide in the drive. BOUNDFORJAMAICA broke sharply and stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the first turn,
continued with a ground saving trip through the final turn, and finished evenly from along the inside in the lane. LASTING LIGHT settled well off the early
pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact while finishing
six wide in the lane. The three quarter split for this race was currently unavailable.

ICE BREAKER broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run
down the backstretch, took a narrow advantage into the final turn, and held TEXAS HUMOR safely at bay late to prevail. TEXAS HUMOR away well and
tracked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backside, rallied
smartly three wide through the final turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. SILVER ARROW settled off
the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the lane the first time, held her position in the run to the backstretch, rallied two wide
through the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to garner a share. GROOVY GIRL lagged well back early while saving ground at the rail through the
first turn, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, and found her best stride late while finishing four wide in the drive. LIZZIES GIRL settled off the
early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, began to make some headway two wide midway down the backstretch, rallied
three wide entering the final turn, and finished from down along the inside in the stretch drive. DONE THAT settled off the early pace while racing three wide
through the stretch the first time, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backside and into the final turn, and failed to mount a late bid. DON'T TESS
ME lagged well off the early pace while racing three wide entering the stretch the first time, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied
three wide through the final turn, but failed to menace. SOUTHERN LASS away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first
time, continued to set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, struggled to match strides with her pace rival entering the final
turn, and weakened over the final furlong.
