Footnotes
CREATIVE CADENCE broke sharp, took control early on, under a snug hold around the turn, felt pressure from the outside entering the stretch, shook clear
inside the furlong marker, came home under a steady ride. SALTWATER GYPSY stalked the leader into turn, raced outside the pace setter, always in good
position, moved out top of lane for run at leader, under a drive could not keep pace with winner, clear second at the wire. STEPHANIE MY LOVE stalking
the top pair into the first turn, stayed clear while racing in the show spot around the turn, came under a drive stretch, could not catch leaders, held the show
running even late. MY TRUE PASSION lacked speed from the gate, running three wide into turn, moved out top of stretch, under a drive at the eighth pole,
had no late bid. SANTANGELO broke a step slow, raced along the inside around the turn, called on stretch, came up empty. THENCOMEMORNING away
last, moved out five wide soon after the start, moved inside midway around the turn, clear running room inside, outrun stretch.

Footnotes
I KNOW YOU LOVE ME raced off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn, raced three wide near the quarter pole, shifted out through the
stretch run to race well off the inside and held safe under strong handling. WE DONT NEED ROADS was allowed to settle early, challenged the leader near
the eighth pole for the lead from the outside and finished willingly to the wire. DUKE OF GLOUCESTER stalked the pace along the inside down the
backstretch, raced near the rail around the far turn through the stretch run and kept on to the wire. RIVER FULL settled off the early pace, raced five wide
into the upper stretch, shifted in through the stretch run and had no late rally. GRANDPA'S KID stalked the early pace, raced four to five wide in the stretch
run and raced evenly late. THE GRAYT PUMPKIN was coaxed along from the outside to press the early leader and weakened the final quarter of a mile.
FREDDYNESS showed good early speed to set the early pace and gave way. SEA CRUISE lost ground to race far back and was eased up on in the stretch
run.

Footnotes
RELENTLESS RUBY , stalked the pace setters into turn, took a three wide trip around the turn, moved out four wide top of stretch, came under a ride while
outside rivals, drifted in deep stretch, dove past final jumps. CHARGE THROUGH tracked the leader into the turn, glued to the outside of rival leaving the
quarter pole, came under a drive while running between horses nearing the eighth pole, shifted in bumping with SWIFT FACTOR, stayed on well. SWIFT
FACTOR inside speed away from the gate, held the rail position around the turn, under constant pressure from the outside, queued up with a vigorous ride
through the stretch, had to check hard nearing the sixteenth marker, held on late for the show. HOLLYWOOD GINA lacked early speed, stayed off the pace
and wide into turn, racing five wide then six wide through the stretch, found best strides late. NOTION INTERRUPTUS , tracked the leaders into turn, shifted
around rival midway through the turn, came under a drive, finished even deep stretch. MOON BIZ called up early for speed, asked into turn, lost contact with
leaders, outrun through the stretch. There was a stewards inquiry, and a riders objection logged, the rider of SWIFT FACTOR claimed foul against CHARGE
THROUGH and RELENTLESS RUBY. Stewards ruled that CHARGE THROUGH interfered with SWIFT FACTOR during the stretch run, Disqualified
CHARGE THROUGH from second to third.

Footnotes
CHALK HILL settled off the early pace, moved up towards the outside of rivals around the far turn through the stretch run and finished determinedly while
racing well off the inside to prove best under strong handling. QUEEN OF MINE chased the early leader down the backstretch, was hard ridden nearing the
three eighths pole, raced five wide through the upper stretch, dug in inside the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire. MYGIDGETMARIE showed
good early speed, had a clear lead near the quarter pole and weakened the final eighth of a mile. SPECIAL ASSISTANT stalked the pace and tired while
racing off the inside. LIFESAWINDINGROAD broke awkwardly, threw head early, was under tight hold in the early going, trailed and never threatened while
racing off the inside.

SERIFOS was rated down the backstretch, ridden along to challenge the leader nearing the five sixteenths pole, moved up to the outside to race well off the
inside in the stretch run, forged clear under steady handling, appeared to have had a broken left iron deep stretch and proved best. JACK A ROSE broke
awkwardly, lost a considerable amount of ground early, jockey adjusted right iron soon after the start, forced four wide around the first turn to circle foes to
set the early pace, raced in hand down the backstretch, was challenged through the far turn, raced well off the inside in the stretch run and was no match for
the winner. NO ANGEL stalked the pace while racing between rivals, was urged along nearing the three eighths pole and had not enough for the top pair.
JUST DEAL WITH IT tracked the early lead from the inside and stopped.

GREYZER raced wide around the first turn, stayed just off the pace tracking the leaders from a four wide position, shifted out widest at the quarter pole,
under a very energetic hand ride, cleared off leaving the furlong marker, kept to task under the wire. EVEN THUNDER tacked the leader around the first
turn, stalked the leader while running between horses, called on for best run after the quarter pole, still between horses through the stretch, tried hard
through the wire. AMERICAN ROMA sent out for the early lead around the first turn, stayed inside racing on the front end, came under heavy pressure from
his outside, held inside position at the top of the stretch, could not hold off closers late. KINGS HIGHWAY lacked speed around the first turn, raced well off
the pace down the backside, moved inside for stretch run, found his best strides deep stretch. DASHING LOU off the early pace, waited for running room
along the inside, came under a drive nearing the three eighths pole, lost contact with leaders, no late kick. FIRSTCADETE lacked early speed, raced well off
the pace down the backside, urged far turn, outrun through the stretch. MUCHACHO MACHO tracked wide around the first turn, stalking four wide down the
