SEDONA ROCKS stalked the pacesetter, loomed while tracking that rival on the turn, bid at the quarter pole, took charge and drew clear under urging. SEA
BREW steadied at the start, was outrun early, moved up four wide on the turn and rallied for second. ROLIN N CONTROLIN raced off the pace, came four
wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside and was along for the show spot. SANTAFE EXPRESS raced off the pace, chased the leaders on the turn and
finished evenly. BIG EYE JOY raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. I'M A CUTIE showed good early speed to set the pace, briefly dueled with the
winner at the quarter pole and faded. ATLANTIC FRONT raced three or four wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
COOL FRONT raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far turn, waited for room behind rivals in upper stretch, split horses at the furlong marker,
closed willingly inside, dueled with UP HER SLEEVE in the final sixteenth and prevailed at the wire. UP HER SLEEVE tracked on the inside, advanced
inside on the far turn, went two wide at the quarter pole, bid entering the stretch, dug in gamely between rivals at the eighth pole and then dueled with COOL
FRONT to the wire. MYSTIC DREAMS raced two wide off the pace, moved up four wide on the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, dueled past the
furlong marker, dug in and earned the show spot. RAINOUT raced off the pace inside, advanced on the turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly
outside. STILL DOING TIME hopped at the start, raced off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn and rallied on the rail in the stretch. MAARTY'S
DILEMMA was off a bit slow, trailed the field and closed belatedly inside. PRETTY SPECTACULAR set the pace on the inside, dueled on the backside,
shook free, then weakened. EXCULPATE stalked two wide, chased on the far turn and tired. REAL WILD SOLUTION raced two wide off the pace, three
wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. UNMARKED MONEY pressed the pace, dueled on the backside and gave way on the far turn.
