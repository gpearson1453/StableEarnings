CUTETIP dueled for the lead from along the inside, dropped back nearing the quarter pole, then came again along the inside and proved best in a stiff drive.
TALKINGNONSTOP bobbled at the start then was permitted to settle in stride, came three-wide into the stretch and finished fast. LOVELY HUSSAR vied
for the lead with Cutetip from along the outside, took head lead nearing the quarter pole, opened an advantage in the stretch and then failed to last while
drifting in slightly late. FULLY COMPLIANT dropped back early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
GYPSY GUN saved ground setting the pace and drew off to win with something left. DANNY ZUKO prompted the pace from along the outside, drifted out
wide leaving the quarter pole, could not stay with the winner but was clearly second best. ASSURANCE bumped at the start with Alphabetical, then saved
ground while being unhurried and gradually improved his position without threatening the top two. ALPHABETICAL bumped at the start with Assurance,
then was allowed to settle, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole but lacked a rally. PRINCE SKIMMING dropped back early and was not a factor.
DARK N' HANDSOME was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide and gave way.

ANTECEDENCE stalked the pace racing in hand, angled out to come four-wide nearing the quarter pole, caught the leaders nearing the eighth pole and
proved best in a stiff drive. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL dueled for the lead from along the inside, responded when asked and held on gamely to lost a tough
decision. INEEDAMANIANDAPEDI vied for the lead while racing two-wide, dug in during the drive and held on stubbornly to the wire. WHATA FLIRT was
allowed to settle in stride, came three-wide into the stretch, but lacked room behind horses the final sixteenth. BEAU ROCKS permitted to settle in stride
early, moved up along the outside on the turn, was five-wide the final quarter and lacked a rally. SHEZ A GRINDER saved ground early, angled out slightly
for the drive, steadied nearing the sixteenth pole lacking room and was in tight from there to the wire.

Footnotes
LASSIE CAT saved ground stalking the pace, angled out three-wide nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with a rush to be up in the final seventy
yards. SIGNATURE COLORS dueled with Summer Pudding for the early early, shook that one off nearing the stretch to open a clear lead, but unable to
resist the winner late. DONTFORGETHESUGAR was unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out for the drive and finished fast.
SUMMER PUDDING vied for the lead to near the stretch from along the outside and tired. DAVENPORT bobbled at the start, then raced three-wide and
failed to threaten. R HAPPY PLACE dropped back early and was not a factor.

CLASSIC LEAH saved ground setting the pace in hand and drew off to win with something left. BRILLIANT BIRD broke out to bump with Unlimiteddataplan,
then was allowed to settle while saving ground, slipped through entering the stretch and finished strongly for the place. IN THE VAULT dropped back early,
rallied six-wide the final three-sixteenths and made up some ground late. LADY O'PRADO unhurried early, swung out four-wide nearing the quarter pole but
lacked the needed late response. LE TUB was forwardly placed to the stretch while racing three-wide and weakened. UNLIMITEDDATAPLAN was bumped
at the start, then was prominent early racing from between horses and tired.
