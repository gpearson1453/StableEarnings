raced three wide near the quarter pole, angled out widest through the lane and finished well to get up for the place position. MY SISTER CLURRIE was sent
along to set the early pace from the outside and weakened through the stretch run. GOLDEN EIB MICRPHN stalked the pace, raced near the inside at the
quarter pole, raced between in the drive and had not enough. MIZZEN settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside around the far turn through the
stretch and had no late response. MOON ME AGAIN dropped to back of the pack early on, was hard ridden through the far turn while racing four wide and
lacked a bid. MOUNTAIN LILLY pressed the pace.

Footnotes
GUNSLINGER (IRE) showed good early speed from the outside to set the early pace and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. SOVEREIGN
WARRIOR stalked the pace, raced three to four wide and finished willingly to the wire. BORGOBYTHESEA tracked the early leader while racing two wide,
raced four to five wide in the lane and kept on to the wire. HONORABLE HERO stalked the pace, raced near the inside and had no final winning bid.
THREEOHTWOCASSIE was slow early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. TROUBLE COFFEE was allowed to settle
early, raced six wide through the upper stretch and lacked a rally. I SAY I PLAY was unhurried early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and had no
response.
