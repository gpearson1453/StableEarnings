AWARD NOMINATED away in good order around the first turn, stayed just off the outside flank of the pace setter down the backside, took a three wide run
at leader around the far turn, under a strong drive shook off the inside foe, held off the outside challenger, clear late driving. WISH FOR PEACE , off the
early pace, was keen to run on around the first turn, settled into stride down the backstretch, angled out four wide around the far turn, stayed outside
through the stretch, gained the place while racing on left lead. UNDER THE RADAR queued up early, ridden along down the backstretch, shifted out five
wide after leaving the quarter pole, stayed wide under a strong drive, gaining ground late. UNION FLEET reserved around the first turn, stayed off the pace
racing down the backside, came under a strong ride around the far turn, split horses top of lane, could not sustain momentum through the stretch. SHADY
MUNNI stalked the pace setters while racing along the inside, came under a heavy ride around the far turn, held position till the eight pole, flattened out
through deep stretch. SOVEREIGN CHANGE went to the front around the first turn, stayed in control of the pace down the backstretch, came under heavy
pressure from the eventual winner around the turn, could not keep pace faded in deep stretch. LA FLECHA lacked speed into first turn, churned down the
backside, outrun through the stretch.

Footnotes
GLOSSAMER was bumped at the break, rated along down the backstretch, moved up three wide near the quarter pole and finished strongly in the stretch
run to edge clear under steady handling. IRAZU pressed the early leader while racing four wide down the backstretch, lead narrowly through the upper
stretch but was no match for the winner in the drive. BAD TEMPER rated along the inside in the early going, raced three to four wide in the stretch run and
kept on to the wire. WHISPERING WANDA was bumped at the break, stalked the early going, moved up three wide between rivals in the stretch run and
had not enough late. TALKS IN HER SLEEP settled off the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. FARCICAL was
void of early speed, swung widest through the lane and never threatened. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL was allowed to settle early, raced four wide near the three
sixteenths pole and had no response. SAINTS VICTORY was unhurried early on, raced four deep into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. BON FIRE DIVA
showed good early foot to set the early pace while racing three wide early and tired in the stretch run while racing near the inside. SWEET BALLERINA lost
ground to race far back and never threatened.

Footnotes
SUTTON VALLEY showed nice early speed, moved away from the field around the turn, still in control inside the sixteenth pole, felt pressure from
BOURBON OVER ICE, went clear under a quick drive. BOURBON OVER ICE broke sharp, settled into nice three wide stalking position down the backside,
came under strong urging nearing the quarter pole, shifted out middle of the lane for best run, gaining ground late, could not catch leader. NEIGH DUDE ,
settled off the pace down the back stretch, moved out four wide around the turn, called on for best run in the stretch, finished even late. ROCKY DICE
lacked early speed, stayed off the pace till nearing the three eighths pole, shifted out four wide, went wider at the top of the stretch, could not make any
headway late. MESMERIZED broke slow, moved up along the inside, on the bit and a little head strong, had to slightly steady down the back side, regained
stride quickly, pressed around the turn, finished even late. STORMY BONNIE , broke with the leaders, stayed just off the early pace, shifted inside nearing
the three eighths, urged on for best run, faded through the lane. TINKER'S PAL running middle pack early, asked to quicken into turn, failed to respond,
outrun through the stretch. PER RULING FROM HISA, ROCKY DICE WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR CROP VIOLATION.
