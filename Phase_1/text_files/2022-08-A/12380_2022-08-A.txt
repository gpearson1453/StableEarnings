Footnotes
LITTLE RED SCOOTER perfect position off rail to turn, four wide run in a long drive to hold sway at the wire. LEMON GO inside run to the turn, angled out
wide into stretch, rallied in the drive but could get past late. KICK ROCKS KID off rail trip while never far back, ran on and held show spot gamely at the
wire. MAJESTIC MR. JONES no speed to the turn, rallied in the stretch to improved position. WE THANK YOU rushed inside to duel for a half, weakened in
the final furlong. LUTE'S ANGEL inside trip to turn, never untracked with no late gain. LOCKDOWN LOVER good position to turn, short lead quarter pole,
gave in readily. MAD ADAM far back while never a threat. SONSHINE PEGASUS in the mix to the turn but gave way readily in the stretch run.
DARETOBELUCKY never factored while always far back.
