LADY'S BOY was bumped at the start, quickly shook clear, set all the pace unchallenged and won as much the best under a hand ride. UNCAPTURED
PULSE chased the winner and held on for second. RULING EMPIRE trailed into the stretch then had a mild late rally in the five path. VOLBEAT was
fractious in the gate, unseated his rider, broke through and ran off briefly then upon being reloaded failed to menace. BRYCE'S ANGEL bumped the winner
at the start and was no factor. FUNNY BONE was through after a half.

best. QUIET AMIGO stalked the pace three wide, improved position in upper stretch, drifted to the eight path and held on for second. IT'S YOUR CALL
never far back, drifted to the seven path and finished determinedly. BEAT THE DEALER had speed from the start, offered a mild bid along the rail midway
on the far turn then leveled off. SUSIE'S KID was no factor. JIMTOWN was outrun. LUCKY STREAK sped to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured
pace along the inside for a half then was used up.
