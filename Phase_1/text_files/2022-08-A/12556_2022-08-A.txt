challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to the sixteenth pole, was outclosed and held for place. AWHITESPORTSCOAT challenged three across on the
turn, dueled to the sixteenth pole, didn't have enough late and settled for show. AVALON KING set a pressured pace to mid stretch and was unable to
sustain her bid. OLYMPIC EXPRESS held a good position and lacked the needed late response under mild urging. TW SKIPPING STONES raced inside
and showed brief speed only. HOLLYWOOD HEAT raced in the back, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a stretch response. Hand timed.

Footnotes
LINEMANS CHECK settled off the pace, rallied on the turn to challenge, dueled to mid stretch, drew off for a clear lead and held off the late charge of
CHECK AND RAISE. CHECK AND RAISE was unhurried early, advanced on the turn, closed with a rush and was gaining fast late. ALBANY FRONT was
never far back, raced inside, angled out on the turn, swung wide and continued willingly to the wire. ROLL OUT vied to mid stretch, faltered and dropped
back. KONA COAST vied to mid stretch and gave way. INCLUDE HOO pressed inside early, fell back and went evenly thereafter. STARSHIP CHEWY
hopped at the start to be away slowly and failed to contend. OUTLAW BY NATURE was through early. Hand timed.
