VIDIRA, back early, advanced off rail into stretch, rallied between horses, took over in deep stretch. ENHANCED FINANCE stalked off rail, advanced
five-wide in late turn to challenge into stretch, took over mid stretch, bid to deep stretch, couldn't match the winner late. FAT N BITTER, well placed inside,
challenged along the rail into stretch, was bumped hard by PURPLE SCOOTER when that one lugged in in early stretch, hit the rail, checked, kept coming
to make a bid to late stretch before tiring. PURPLE SCOOTER opened up, pressured from the outside in late turn, lugged in in early stretch, bumped rival,
gave way after passing eighth pole. SKY VUE, well placed outside, challenged four-wide in late turn, bid to sixteenth pole, gave way. CATALINA DREAMIN
was held up at the gate, broke slow, showed little. Following a STEWARDS INQUIRY, CATALINA DREAMIN was found to have received an unfair start and
was declared a non-starter. All monies wagered on CATALINA DREAMIN were refunded, except for multi-race wagers, in which the favourite was
