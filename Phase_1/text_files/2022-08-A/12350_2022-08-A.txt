clear. WYOMING CONQUEST pressed the pace from the two path to deep stretch and proved to be second best. PREACHER sprinted to a pressured lead
to the eighth pole and weakened. MOST AMUSING was last away made a rail bid on turn then angled out to four wide in upper stretch but failed to menace.
SCOOTER'S BOY chased the leaders from the two path then moved to the three path at the five sixteenths pole and gave an even effort. BLUE TWISTED
STEEL raced in the middle of the pace from the two path and faded. GEE WHIZ WHO saved ground to the turn then checked sharply at the three eighths
pole and galloped home. STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING AT THE THREE EIGHTHS POLE, AFTER A REVIEW GEE WHIZ WHO CHECKED

Footnotes
RIVER BISCUIT was roused to contention and pressed the pace from the inside engaged leader in upper stretch and wore down leader to be just up. STAR
IN HEAVEN went to the early lead under pressure from the two path was collared at the three sixteenths pole and fought gamely to the wire to prove second
best. TYLERS ANGEL WINGS saved ground while racing back slipped through at the end of the bend and was no match for the top two. E R F TOTAH
RAIN was last away made a bid in mid turn to move to three wide in upper stretch and was best of the rest. TRICKY LEX was close up early made a mild
bid on the turn and gave even effort. KISSA DONNA DE BUY chased the leaders from four wide, had a hard time navigating the turn and was six wide into
the stretch and faded. MEMPHIS MELTDOWN lost the rider going onto the track then vied for the lead from the three path and faded in mid turn.

inside then moved out to four to five wide on the turn and chased the winner home. JUST REMEMBER was positioned off the pace in the two path and
couldn't gain on the winner. INTO CLASSIC raced in the middle of the pack on the inside then moved between horses at the end of the bend but wasn't
enough and just missed the show. INAGOODWAY chased the leaders from the two path and weakened. PRANKED raced in the middle of the pack from
