AW ITE broke sharply hustling on a clear lead through the turn racing inside to upper stretch angling out ending near mid track holding firm under vigorous
handling. UNBRIDLEDSELECTION a step slow early gave a mild move into upper stretch extending up for place late four wide. PERTH AMBOY chased a
brisk pace through the turn angling five wide in upper stretch weakening late near mid track. LIVING VICARIOUSLY saved ground vying along the rail in
upper stretch weakening late. AJZAL played no factor. R HOT TWENTY'S was never involved. DONNELS CREEK was always outrun. YENISEY in tight
between horses early was bumped and jostled steadying back.

Footnotes
INSPIRING JUSTICE broke sharply to clear early angling off the inside responding well to late pressure. REJUVENATE pressed hard from the break
couldn't get to the winner while saving place. ANDY'S THE BEST a step slow at the outset raced widest closing late. GRAZED MY BISCUITS hustled on the
inside needed more. GHOST SQUAD racing a step slow was never a factor. J P'S SONG never got going.
