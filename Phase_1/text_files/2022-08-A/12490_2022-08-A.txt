Footnotes
KEYSTONE HANK well placed, looped to a striking position four wide through the turn, gained a short lead three wide, then came again the final furlong and
drew off under steady pressure. SLENDER BETSY well placed, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, edged
ahead at the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner and held the place. AEGONTHECONQUEROR eased to a clear lead off the rail, stayed on
when challenged through the turn, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. RAINAS ROLLIN rated inside, saved ground through the turn, came
through inside into the stretch and faded. AVENGEMENT passed a tiring rival. CHAMPAGNE FOR ALL was no factor.

Footnotes
WATERLOO SUNSET allowed to settle, looped up four and five wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up in
the final strides. DOWN TO EARTH well placed, gained position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged
ahead late and was outfinished. BELLE'S KINGDOM mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out for
clear racing room and lacked the needed late kick. GUCCI GAL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the turn,
then weakened late and held a share. BAD PAY stalked the pace on the inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch
and weakened late. ROYAL GOLD DIGGER improved her position, inside. COURTED passed tiring rivals. EMPEROR'S SONG tracked the pace, steadied
on heels into the turn, held position on the two path through the turn, then faded three wide into the stretch. WINNING TOUGH well placed, gained position
three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no rally.

Footnotes
LOYALTY well placed and off the rail, gained position two and three wide through the turn, bid outside the leader four wide into the stretch, shook clear, then
drew off and was kept to the task. MAJESTIC D'ORO well placed, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then was no
match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. CHASING FIREFLIES pulled to the lead well off the rail, angled in to save ground through the turn,
drifted out into the stretch, weakened and held the show. BABY NO WORRIES allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into
the stretch and closed well for a share. SEQUIN LADY allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the
stretch, steadied on heels, angled in and could not gain. LEMIEUX allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path
and flattened out. YOU LOOK COLD mid pack, angled out while moving up through the turn, came five wide into the stretch and had no rally. ROYAL
COUNTY mid pack, looped four and five wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and faded. TOP GUN GIRL rated outside the leader, lost
some ground on the two path through the turn, then had no stretch rally. MYSTIQUE SABOTEUR broke sharply from the gate, dropped back quickly and
was no factor.
