AROLLERCOASTERRIDE broke a half step slowly, was coaxed along nearing the half-mile marker and contested the pace through the turn, took command
into the drive and drew away in the final stages. SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, carved out quick fractions while
vying for the lead nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace with the winner in the drive but stayed on to be best of the rest. I CAN'T HEAR YOU was
hustled to contest the solid early pace, raced between rivals on the turn while vying for the lead nearing the quarter pole, lost ground in upper stretch and
gave way late while holding safely for third. UNION GIG chased the solid pace, improved position on the turn while three wide, lost ground in upper stretch
and did not offer a late rally. BOSS OF THEMOSS lunged at the start and was off a bit slowly, lacked speed through the turn and was not a factor. ITALIAN
LOVE SONG chased the early pace to the turn, lost position on the turn while four wide and tired readily in the stretch.

Footnotes
DADDYS NINA rated off of the early pace, improved position on the turn, mounted a four wide bid in upper stretch, overtook RAGTIME GIRL leaving the
furlong marker and pulled away in the final sixteenth. GETAWAY CHARM tracked the moderate early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, came five
wide into the drive, lost ground in upper stretch but showed good late interest and re-rallied to get up for second in the final strides. RAGTIME GIRL was
sent to the front while in hand, disputed the pace through the turn, was confronted by the winner in mid-stretch, could not hold off that foe's bid and gave
way in the late going, while well clear of the rest for third. BEAUTYINTHEBEAST was on a tight early hold then was given rein to contest the pace into the
turn, dueled for the lead to the quarter marker, stayed on into mid-stretch and tired in the final furlong. SMILING MELANIE chased the pace to the turn, ran
evenly through the bend while three wide, the rider dropped his crop at the head of the lane and lacked a late response. APRIL AFFAIR was off a bit slowly
and lacked early speed, trailed through the turn and and was not a factor.

A DIME FOR ME was hustled to the early lead, took a narrow advantage to the turn, was confronted by ST. ANNIE'S INDY approaching the quarter marker,
dueled with that rival to mid-stretch and turned that one away in the final stages to prove best at the end. ST. ANNIE'S INDY pressed the pace to the turn,
advanced to confront A DIME FOR ME nearing the quarter marker, dueled to mid-stretch with the winner and was turned away in the final sixteenth while
besting the rest. JAN JAN CAN hopped at the start then was bumped leaving the break and was off slowly, trailed to the turn, came four to five wide to the
quarter marker, swung six wide into the drive, was not able to impact the top two in the end but rallied late to secure third. RUNNIN DIVA tracked the
moderate pace through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and could not muster a late rally. MIA SOLINA chased the pace, came three wide along the

MAMIE VAN D was unhurried early on while never far back, saved all of the ground into the second turn, angled out in upper stretch, closed fast while on
the left lead in the final furlong, came within aim in deep stretch and made a late surge to prevail. GOT CURLY was sent to the early lead and cleared the
field into the first turn, set decent fractions while well handled through the second turn, was set down for the drive, was kept to steady urging into the final
sixteenth and was nailed in the final strides for the win, while besting the rest. VINNIEBOB tracked the decent pace while well placed, chased the pacesetter
into the drive, was outkicked in the final furlong but was well clear for third. INFERNAL TIGER broke in at the start and was off a step slowly, came three
wide into the first turn, advanced to track the pace through the backstretch run, lost position on the second turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in
the final stages.

Footnotes
BOBBY'S ALIBI raced close to the early moderate pace, advanced on the turn, overtook HOLIDAY HUSTLE inside of the furlong marker and kicked clear in
the final stages. HOLIDAY HUSTLE broke sharply and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the turn, was overtaken by the winner
inside of the eighth pole but stayed on to be best of the rest. AWESOME DUDE stalked the pace from a ground saving position, ran evenly to mid-stretch,
was outkicked in the final furlong and just held for third at the end. BIG BENO stalked the moderate pace outside of rivals and lacked a late rally in the drive.
THUNDER OF ZION stalked the pace, gained ground three deep on the turn, lost position in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
HARBOR ABBEY settled off of the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, saved ground into the second turn, angled out three wide at
the head of the lane, overtook DERRYGOOLIN nearing the furlong marker, jumped a bare patch in deep stretch and held on in the final strides to prevail.
DERRYGOOLIN rated just off of the early pace, made a steady advance on the pacesetter leaving the half-mile marker, overtook LYINATTHEBAR leaving
the quarter marker, could not match strides with HARBOR ABBEY in the drive, stayed close to that foe when that one jumped a patch in deep stretch and
was second best. LYINATTHEBAR was away in good order, opened to a clear lead into the first turn, set moderate fractions into the second turn, was
overtaken by DERRYGOOLIN leaving the quarter marker, stayed in contention to mid-stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth. LADY IN A HURRY
stalked the early pace, came three wide into the backstretch run, lost ground into the second turn and lacked a late response. SUGAR ON TOP was off
slowly, was unhurried early on, lost contact into the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ST ANTHONY was unhurried early on, advanced nearing the half-mile marker, gained ground two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, swung out in
upper stretch, came within aim of the top pair inside of the eighth pole and surged in the final strides to prevail. IL BELLATOR settled three wide off of the
early quick pace, mounted a four wide bid on the far turn, battled with MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH to mid-stretch, was all out in the final strides and was nailed
for the win while just holding for second. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH settled off of the early dueling pacesetters, advanced along the backstretch run, was
roused three wide approaching the quarter marker, battled for the lead with IL BELLATOR to mid-stretch and was overtaken by the winner in the final strides
while holding safely for third in the end. C'MON MAN was allowed to settle, advanced along the backstretch run, came in tight while along the inside nearing
the quarter marker, came two wide into the drive and was outfinished in the stretch run. HIGHLAND GHOST hustled to the early lead, dueled on the front
end while setting fast fractions, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth.
CRAZY DREAMS was sent to contest the early lead, dueled for pace duties through the backstretch run and into the far turn, lost ground in upper stretch
and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
WAR GAMES was off a half step slowly leaving the break, was asked for early speed and cleared the field nearing the half-mile marker and set quick
fractions through the turn, was in hand entering the drive and drew to a clear lead in mid-stretch, felt mild late pressure but held foes at bay in the final
sixteenth to prevail. ULTIMATE BANGO tracked the quick early pace while outside of horses to the turn, ranged up four wide nearing the quarter marker,
chased the winner into the drive, closed in the final sixteenth, was not able to reel in the winner in the end but held for second in a blanket finish for the
minor awards. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD chased the pace to the turn, maintained position to the quarter pole, rallied along the inside in deep stretch and was
up in time for third while just missing for second. I'M CORFU stalked the fast pace three deep through the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, gained ground in
the late stages but was outfinished in the final sixteenth and just missed for the minor awards. PSYCHO DAR broke in at the start and was off slowly,
chased the quick pace from the rear through the turn, swung widest into the drive and finished well while unable to impact the leaders in the late stages.
DARNQUICK raced close to the quick pace, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. STRIKE IT LUCKY pressed the pace to the turn,
lost position nearing the quarter marker and gave way in the drive. PAPAPIFAS was squeezed while in tight quarters soon after the start, chased the quick
pace from near the rear and was unable to muster a late rally.
