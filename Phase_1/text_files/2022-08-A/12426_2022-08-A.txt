Footnotes
WELL SPENT broke out then hit the gate and stumbled awkwardly, recovered to race just off the pace under restraint, drafted inside around the turn, was
asked while cutting the corner into the stretch then hugged the fence while making a brave bid inside of three opponents at the three-sixteenths, was driven
through under a strong-hand ride to take the lead into the final furlong, shook clear under two pops of a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then
was placed back under a brisk hand-ride to the wire while best. MIA BEA STAR dropped back after the start then settled at the rear, went two then three
wide around the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, swung five wide into upper stretch then gained into contention, made a brief bid while outside
into the final furlong but proved no match for the winner while willingly able to secure the place. INDIAN BELLA tracked the pace down the backstretch, was
asked outside the seven-sixteenths, made a bid under urging in the three path on the turn, vied between foes from the three-eighths, turned into upper
stretch under a drive while still between horses, continued to battle between rivals into the final furlong then weakened while clear for the show.
CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE settled nicely on the outside, ranged up four wide to make a bid midway through the turn, gained a short lead under a drive into
upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner into the final furlong and tired. NEW YORK BANKER went to the front, showed the way while off the rail, was
challenged while in the two path on the turn, came under increased urging outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage while between foes in upper stretch,
dropped back between rivals into the final furlong and gave way.

Footnotes
LAUGH AND PLAY got bumped at the start by FAIRY CAKES, who broke in a step at the start, showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible
splits facing no pressure despite QUARIA THUNDER poised to her outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when being tested by that rival for the
initial time, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a right handed crop clinging to command narrowly, had the rider switch to the left hand
with the stick a furlong out, came out two paths herding out QUARIA THUNDER latched on to her outside before delivering a glancing bump just inside the
sixteenth marker knocking her main danger a bit off stride and forcing MASABEEH to alter out a path in behind her, dug in and just lasted on the wire.
QUARIA THUNDER three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when advancing to pressure the leader,
spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive head to head and was herded out two paths inside the final furlong as LAUGH AND PLAY came
outwards under a left handed crop, then got bumped off stride by that same rival continuing outwards and in turn forced MASABEEH to alter out a path in
behind her and just missed at the end. MASABEEH tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for
home, dug in under a drive closing well on the top pair and was forced to alter out just inside the final sixteenth when QUARIA THUNDER got bumped
outwards in front and was along for the show honors on the line. COMMAND POINT tracked the pace just off the inside until tucked inside with
seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then made no late headway while offering up
a mild bid. OUR JESSICA pulled on the bit early on under the restraint of the rider off heels and spun four wide into the first turn when growing a bit rank,
went three wide through the bend and gave chase three then two wide coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch
and offered no response. FAIRY CAKES (GB) broke in a step at the start bumping LAUGH AND PLAY, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run as well as a Claim of foul by the rider
of QUARIA THUNDER alleging interference against LAUGH AND PLAY at the sixteenth marker. After review, it was deemed that LAUGH AND PLAY had
interfered with QUARIA THUNDER at the sixteenth marker and LAUGH AND PLAY was disqualified from victory and placed second prior to the race being
declared official.

Footnotes
JAY'STALKER bumped soundly with a rival at the start then was sent hard, disputed the pace while several paths inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the
turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, shook clear into upper stretch, responded well under a right-handed crop under threat from the runner-up into
the final furlong and drew off under steady urging. CAPT' REMINGTON bumped soundly with a rival at the start, was coaxed along on the outside in the
second flight, chased three then four wide around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the winner under the crop while looming a threat
into the final furlong but proved no match while clear for the place. BARONE MARCHIS broke out then was corrected by the rider, was urged along early
then settled at the back, started the turn in the two path, shifted four wide outside the five-sixteenths and jostled with MAKART, moved to the five path late
on the bend, turned into upper stretch under a drive, held a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but flattened out and settled for the show.
MAKART broke a step slow then checked while in tight between horses, spotted the front several lengths, was urged along on the outside, raced in the four
path early on the turn, was jostled and forced five wide outside the five-sixteenths, dropped back to the four path outside the quarter-pole and came up
empty. DEVIL OR ANGEL broke in front then stumbled about one stride from the gate, chased the pace down the backstretch, saved ground around the
turn and tired. MY SLICK NICK disputed the pace on the outside while well out in the track, vied in the four then three path around the turn, dropped back
into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
GOOD MEASURE moved in early, brushed with a foes while in the two path around the first turn, was reserved while saving ground, jostled with a foe into
the second turn, continued to save ground under reserve, was roused on the final turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, chased into the final
furlong, made a bid between horses into the final sixteenth, bumped with the runner-up late and got up to narrowly prevail. RHEAUME broke out and
bumped soundly with a foe, was rated while well placed on the inside, came under urging on the final turn, was driven into the two path entering the stretch,
drifted out under a left-handed crop in pursuit of the leader into the final furlong, switched to a right-handed crop shortly thereafter, made a bid into the final
sixteenth, bumped with the winner late and just missed while able to get the place. BALLYMORE STAR (IRE) went to the front, showed the way while inside
to the two path, came under coaxing on the final turn, was roused for more with five-sixteenths to run, came under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, led
into the final sixteenth, brushed with a foe while being headed late and missed but just earned the show. SHAD NATION angled in early, brushed with a foe
in the three path on the first turn, was reserved outside while given cover, jostled with a foe into the second turn, continued three wide with cover, was
roused on the final turn, came four wide into the stretch, chased outside while looming a threat into the final furlong, was given one last pop of the crop at
that juncture, had the rider take a peek to the inside outside the sixteenth-pole, raced under a moderate hand-ride to the wire and just missed the
superfecta. HAIL TO hit the outside of the gate at the start, was caught four wide around the opening bend, tracked the pace on the outside in the two to
three path, was given her cue on the final turn, chased into upper stretch, was carried out near the furlong marker then had her path taken while dropping
back a touch and lacked the needed kick. MY SWEET STORY moved in early, went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved while saving ground
through the second turn, remained towards the rear while moving off the inside, was roused three then four wide on the third turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive and failed to threaten. SEQUIST was bumped soundly at the start, brushed with a foe while keen along the rail on the first turn, continued
keen under restraint while moving to the two path before the second turn, dropped further back off the pace in the two path from that point, came under
urging on the final turn and lacked the needed response while gaining some ground late. EXCEPT TEMPTATION dropped to the rear, moved from the rail to
the three path around the first turn, was reserved at the back on the outside, slipped around the trouble in the three path on the second turn, was roused
four wide on the final turn, dropped to the two path outside the quarter-pole, came three wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten.
NOBLE ENTERPRISE dropped back under restraint early, moved from the rail to the two path late on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, went three
then four wide while taken up on the second turn, raced outside down the backstretch, fell to the rear in the three path on the final turn and faltered. ST
MAARTEN GIRL tossed her head and had the rider fall back in the saddle while keen on the initial straightaway, went three then two wide around the first
turn, was rated between foes, jostled with a rival into the second turn, checked sharply while bearing out on that bend, continued to check while getting out
towards the outside fence onto the backstretch and was pulled up then walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, NO
CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

AZTEC NIGHTS got bumped at the start by the breaking inwards SIRIUS LIGHT, chased along the inside coming under light coaxing before being set down
angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, then edged away under a drive kept to task. SIRIUS LIGHT broke in
at the start bumping the aforementioned foe, then got steadied after the start when losing her lane and was under a hold through the early stages before
settling in pursuit inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out four wide into upper stretch and ran on with good energy
to the finish to chase the winner home while clear for the place honors. STELLAR LADY three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and improved position kicking on belatedly to the finish. INFLUENTIALOUS hustled from the start,
showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from RUN FOR COVER to the inside, shook off that rival briefly before heading into the turn and
tucked inside, then came under pressure from RUN FOR COVER once more, this time to the outside and bringing a friend with her in LOVE TANK to her
outside, got placed to coaxing in response nearing the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat yielding command just inside
the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. EXTESSA hustled from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun
two to three wide for home and passed tired rivals in the stretch. RUN FOR COVER hustled from the gate, pressed the pace of INFLUENTIALOUS to the
inside down the backstretch before briefly backing away near the seven-sixteenths to tip to the two path into the turn, came again to pressure the leader
near the five-sixteenths this time with LOVE TANK in tow, got placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole and swung three then two wide into upper stretch
before weakening in the drive. BELLA COSA chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three then two wide through the turn
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened. LOVE TANK coaxed from the gate, chased just off the
inside in close aim early on before tipping three wide and advancing in concert with RUN FOR COVER to her inside into the turn, latched on the top pair
three furlongs from home when placed to coaxing, angled five to six wide for home and tired. SHE'LL NEVER KNOW four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked briefly three wide into the turn before being carried out five wide as PEACH STREET got out to her inside when coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and made no impact. PEACH STREET two to three wide in pursuit, floated out four wide near the
three-eighths carrying out SHE'LL NEVER KNOW to her outside, went six wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

encouragement near the half-mile pole, went four wide under the crop on the far turn, gained six wide into upper stretch, closed well to get the lead at the
sixteenth-pole and proved best under good handling. RAGTIME BLUES went four then three wide around the opening bend, tracked the pace on the
outside, chased in the four path around the final turn, gained to make an outside bid in the five path into upper stretch then took the lead, led under a drive
to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear for the place. PARADE FIELD dropped to the two path on the first turn, settled while last but one, was
asked while two to three wide on the far turn, gained under a drive into upper stretch, made a bid between horses inside the three-sixteenths, continued
between foes into the final furlong and was out-kicked while well clear for the show. DARK STORM was well placed just off the pace in the two path, chased
the leader around the far turn, made a brief bid inside the three-sixteenths and weakened. AUBURN HILLS went six then five wide on the first turn, moved
up late on that bend to contest the pace on the outside, raced well out in the track, moved clear leaving the backstretch, went around the far turn in the three
path while asked, spun four wide into the stretch then lost the advantage at the three-sixteenths and tired. O SHEA CAN U SEE was hustled from the start,
dropped to the three path around the opening turn, moved in early on the backstretch, saved ground for most of the far turn then shifted three wide and
failed to threaten. INVEST was hustled to a clear lead along the rail early, contested the pace while several paths inside of a foe on the backstretch, lost the
advantage before the half-mile pole, came up empty while inside on the far turn and retreated. HANDY went five then four wide on the first turn, settled on
the far outside, was urged four wide early on the far turn then moved to six wide and faltered.

coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled out four wide into upper stretch, then tipped out an additional two paths under a drive straightened away and
closed well to the finish while along for the place honors. CELESTIAL CITY broke in at the start bumping DOUBLE CLUTCH awkwardly into READY TO
PURRFORM, settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. TIZ THE BOMB forwardly placed from the start, bobbled just off the inside into the first turn and settled
tracking the leader in closest aim while just off the inside, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, took the inside route into upper stretch following
the leader into upper stretch, dug in running on to the finish but was outfinished in the late stages. DOUBLE CLUTCH got bumped at the start by
CELESTIAL CITY and in turn bumped STOLEN BASE, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing three wide at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to the wire but was outkicked. WOW WHATA SUMMER broke a half a beat slow and was bumped

Footnotes
GOLDEN PAL broke a bit awkwardly at the rear of the field, was taken up when TRUE VALOUR crossed in front, moved up then was rated outside under a
snug hold, went three wide around the turn, made an outside bid into upper stretch, came in some at the three-sixteenths then was corrected by the rider,
drifted in closer to the runner-up in the final furlong then fought outside that foe under a hand-ride, gained a slim advantage in the final sixteenth, was kept
off the runner-up with a couple tugs of the right rein late and narrowly prevailed under a continued hand-ride to the wire. TRUE VALOUR (IRE) angled in
quickly while going to the front, put multiple foes in tight quarters, showed the way on the inside, responded well when asked outside the quarter-pole, came
under a drive in upper stretch, dug in gamely under threat from the runner-up into the final furlong, fought on determinedly to the wire and just missed while
narrowly able to get the place. THIN WHITE DUKE settled on the outside while detached at the rear of the field, went around the turn in three path, was
roused outside the quarter-pole, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and finished fast but was too late then missed the
exacta while able to get the show. ARZAK bumped with a rival at the start, was reserved while well off the inside early, angled in around the half-mile pole,
saved ground on the turn, was roused while cutting the corner into the stretch, moved out outside the furlong marker and finished well to just miss the
trifecta. YES AND YES broke out slightly then bumped with foes on both sides, was reserved off the pace, came under urging while two then three wide on
the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. SPYCRAFT bumped with a rival at the start, was taken up briefly behind CAROTARI when
that foe was shut-off near the five-eighths, raced towards the front under restraint, drafted inside to the two path on the turn, was asked three wide into the
stretch, moved out into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. CAROTARI was hustled from the start, showed speed on the inside of TRUE
VALOUR then was taken up when shut-off by that foe near the five-eighths, switched to the outside over heels shortly thereafter, tracked outside into the
turn, engaged the leader in the two path around that bend, turned into the stretch between horses and came up empty.

Footnotes
WICKED LADY broke out at the start and was corrected, chased four wide from just off the pace coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung six
wide into upper stretch, rallied to confront the leader a furlong out, dug in taking command a sixteenth from home and edged away to the finish under her
own momentum. JET SET JULIET pressed the pace of REGAL REBEL from the outside three wide, took over command just inside the three-eighths,
swung four to five wide into upper stretch under a drive, dug in under threat and was collared at the sixteenth pole, ran on well clear of the rest to be along
second best. ROZ chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, weakened while along for the show honors.
KUKARO chased two to three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. CAIAROSSA broke
awkwardly and shied out at the start in reaction to a pair of rivals inside her, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside
through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. SKYWARD
PRINCESS broke out at the start and was corrected, chased five wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired.
BIG BEAN CHRISTINE broke out at the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, faltered.
MISS MALALA chased along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. REGAL REBEL
coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from JET SET JULIET to the outside, yielded the front just inside the
three-eighths pole, faded through the latter portion of the turn and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, folded and was eased home to the finish.
