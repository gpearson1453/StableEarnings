between rivals in the two path, moved inside on the turn and faded. IT'S A PITY raced very wide down the backstretch and gave way. RYAN'S FLEET

SUMMARY JUDGMENT controlled the pace inside then extended her advantage in the stretch under moderate urging. BRODY SLAM advanced near the
inside on the final turn, was no match but easily second best. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL prompted the pace outside, bid closer before the half then proved
empty in the stretch. VALERIE FIRST dropped back inside, moved wide on the final turn and was no threat. TIME TO TWO STEP lacked speed and was
never in contention. IRISH JUMPER settled well of the pace and lacked a rally. MIKEY'S JEWEL trailed to the final turn and caught a fading rival. HEY IT'S
TATI prompted the winner briefly inside then stopped abruptly.

leaders and continued willingly in the stretch. MISS PEPPINA dropped back in the two path then closed well while no threat. MS CANELA settled just off the
pacesetter inside, vied to midstretch and tired. PEAK OF CHIC set the pace off the inside, dueled to midstretch and weakened. HEY DEWZPOTS lacked
speed and raced far behind throughout.

SCARAMOUCHE broke slowest then rushed up, took over when ready on the final turn, drew clear and was kept to task to the final stages. ICY STORM
saved ground at the back of the pack, angled out in the stretch to gain the place. UNCLE IRISH controlled the pace inside, lost the lead midway on the final
turn then faltered. ONLYGODCANJUDGEME settled inside, made a menacing bid outside into the stretch and tired. VINE JET lacked speed outside, moved
very wide in the stretch and was no factor. BRINDISI chased in the two path off the leaders and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
EMMA'S TOUCH lacked speed inside, angled wide into the stretch then closed with a rush to get up in time. DEBBIE'S SURPRISE saved ground
throughout, bid to front in midstretch, led but was nailed. CREATIVE JOY broke a step slowly, chased inside and finished with good energy. ORB'S PARTY
GIRL set a clear pace along the rail, was collared into the stretch and tired. IMAGINARY SKY went after the pacesetter on the turn, loomed a threat then
yielded. ESCANDALO dropped far behind, advanced very wide with late energy. HOPS PETUNIA was urged just off the leaders three wide and was
finished after half a mile. SCARF dropped far behind inside then passed fading rivals. EDIES WAY broke sluggishly then was always outrun. BELLA MARIA
raced wide off the leaders and gave way readily. FLY FLY BIRD lagged far behind throughout.

AWESOMENEWYEAR quickly moved clear, remained in command to the stretch, bore out badly through the stretch but lasted. NEW YORK ROCK STAR
settled inside off the pace, advanced into the stretch and finished willingly. DREAMINOFDASIES was urged just off the pacesetter inside and finished
gamely. ZOLA B went after the winner outside on the final turn then flattened out. PLIANTLEA lagged far behind then passed rivals without menacing.
LET'S CELEBRATE prompted the winner outside to the final turn and gave way. WRITE THE CHECK ducked out at the break, stayed outside and was no
factor. OUI MADAME trailed early and was always far behind. SHETALKSTOMUCH saved ground well behind and was never in contention. BROAD
JUMPER raced wide in midpack and gave way readily.

DIVINE MIRACLE stalked the pace outside, took over when ready on the final turn, drew off under urging and was geared down late. SECRET PATH
fanned wide on the first turn, rallied wide but proved no match for the winner. BRETT'S WORLD angled inside early, swung wide in the stretch and finished
willingly. MIDNIGHT CHROME dropped back early inside then passed rivals without menacing. CUNEO saved ground far behind and was never a factor.
THE JONES BOY steadied near the five sixteenths pole then moved inside and faded. TEEWINOT PASS shuffled back into the first turn, trailed early and
was outrun. MR. TUTTLE moved inside within range then gave way readily. JACKS AMERICAN PIE hustled to the front inside for five furlongs and stopped
abruptly.

Footnotes
THEGODDESSOFSNAKES set a measured pace inside, lost the lead briefly near the eighth pole but came again and edged away. AEGEAN SEA rated
outside the pacesetter, led briefly in midstretch but was outfinished. TILSA raced three wide off the dueling leaders and continued well while no threat.
CLOSET SHOPPER far behind early, advanced inside passing rivals. SOLID GOLD DANCER saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally. COLLIN'S
GREY LADY lunged at the start, moved inside and was no factor. SMARTY PANTS SANDY was urged close up three wide down the backstretch then
faltered. LULA'S ROADRUNNER lacked speed, was asked for run into the far turn, steered wide but faded. ICED LATTE ducked out just after the start and
gave way readily.

Footnotes
JAMMINWITHBRANDON settled inside, moved boldly into the far turn, slipped through on the final turn then drew off eagerly. DECKOLOGY prompted the
pace outside then continued well while no match for the winner. SON OF A SAINT saved ground close up then flattened out in the stretch. TACTICAL PLAN
dropped back wide then passed rivals without menacing. GLACIER EXPRESS broke slowly and raced far back throughout. WAGON BOSS settled close up
wide then was finished after three quarters. GENGHIS hustled to the front then began fading at the quarter pole. SOPHOS dropped far behind then passed
fading rivals. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE lacked speed and was never in contention. WILD UNION raced in midpack and lacked a response. OPEN LENGTHS
dropped back early three wide and gave way readily. RISQUE REBEL stumbled badly and fell just after the start then walked off afterward.
