Footnotes
LIKE MOULIN ROUGE raced near the back on the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the turn then moved out to four wide in upper stretch and
took the lead at the eighth pole and held on. SAND CANYON JS tracked the leaders down the backstretch then made a two to three wide on the turn but
couldn't match strides with the winner in the drive to prove second best. BIG PURITY saved ground throughout while racing evenly and passed tiring rival in
the stretch. RB HASHTAG dueled for the lead from the inside to the five sixteenths pole and inched away but weakened about the eighth pole in the drive.
AURA MAKARINA dueled for the lead from the two path to the five sixteenths pole and gave way. DJUDJU SEQ was never a threat. AA RICH WHISKEY
raced in the middle of the pack on the backstretch, dropped back and was not a factor.
