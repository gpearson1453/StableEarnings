Footnotes
PACKS A WAHLOP closest in pursuit outside several runners early, moved in some and went three wide into the turn, bid outside the leader near the
quarter pole, took the lead in upper stretch and kicked clear under urging. GAS ME UP got crowded between rivals and had to steady early, traveled two
wide into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the lane, finished with a mild late bid and gained the place. KID AZTECA drifted in, bumped and put
inner rival in tight up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, waited behind the top pair around the bend then angled to the inside and finished evenly
late. AH JEEZ lugged in and bumped rival then took up early, lacked room and had to check again with a quarter mile left to run, angled inward in the stretch
but lacked room to advance. MATARO sped clear early, led two wide into the turn, moved to the rail around the bend then fought with the winner two wide
into the stretch, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. BAY BAYBE broke a step slow, got bumped from outside then floated out early, trailed
through the turn and failed to menace. EDDIE'S LAST chased three deep early, outside a rival and three wide on the turn and three wide into the lane and
weakened. FAST FALL raced in tight while chasing along the rail and got bumped by outside rival, steadied early on the turn, remained inside to the stretch
and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
ALLEVA was off a bit slow from inside then coaxed to the front and pressed from inside to the half-mile pole, could not stay with the leader and switch to the
outside to chase, drew alongside at the five-sixteenths pole, dueled three wide into the stretch, cleared nearing the eighth pole and held well. GRAY
MAGICIAN got pinched between rivals early, settled off the pace, went six wide into the turn, advanced from outside and moved down to the two path taking
aim at the top pair into the stretch, put in a late run but could not get by the winner. CAJUN TREASURE got crowded between foes early, chased five wide
into the turn, exited the bend three wide and gained the show. STORMINSIDE sped to the front then cleared ALLEVA at the half-mile pole, crossed over into
the two path, challenged again by ALLEVA around the turn, dueled two wide into the stretch and was no match in the final furlong. STAR ENTRY tracked
along the inside through the turn, tipped out in the stretch but flattened out. FULL DRAW was off a bit slow to begin, traveled two wide off the pace into the
turn, angled out into the stretch and lacked a rally. GLENROY dropped back early, rounded the bend two wide and was not a factor. GOING AWAY PARTY
was off a bit slow to begin, saved ground at the back around the bend and made no impact. MAJESTIC WEST chased three deep, three to four wide on the
turn and came up empty. PAUL L tossed his head and came away slow, raced in range off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
TIGER SPICE hard to load into the gate, tossed her head at the start, got crowded between foes early, pulled and had to steady off heels, lacked room
behind a wall of leaders at the quarter pole, tipped out to a clear path in the stretch, rallied between and surged clear. TEQUILA TIGRE broke out, forwardly
placed from outside, bid four deep entering the stretch, took over in upper stretch but was no match for the winner in deep stretch. MISS BAYLEE came out
early then went up to duel for command, vied between foes around the turn, lost command in upper stretch and flattened. BLAZING BARDOT came out in
the beginning, stalked well off the rail, went five wide into the turn, entered the stretch six wide and kept on for a minor award. KAYLAS JOY raced along the
inside from off the pace, lost her path when rival came over exiting the turn, came out in the stretch and finished with a mild rally. RELUCTANT was off slow
to begin then steadied behind rival, went three deep into the turn, angled down to the rail around the bend and improved position. VEGAS DREAM sped
clear and crossed over, dueled into the turn, vied with rivals around the bend, then gave way in the stretch. VALENTINE GHOST pressed three deep early,
fought for command through the turn and gave way. SWEET N GO climbed while chasing just out of range, steadied at the five-sixteenths pole between
rivals and faded. TEQUILA SUNSET broke slow and came in soon after the start, lagged behind and was always outrun.

Footnotes
BIG CITY LIGHTS broke a step slow then went up to clear the field and crossed over, set the pace in the two path through the turn and into the stretch, put
to right-handed urging then switched to the left-hand midstretch and held gamely. SLOW DOWN ANDY tracked inside rival up the backstretch, was closest
in pursuit and driven three wide into the lane, chased within striking distance through the final furlong but had to settle for second best. FINNEUS was a bit
rank early on and was taken out wide on the backstretch, went four wide into the turn then angled down to the rail, steered back out leaving the bend and
came four wide into the stretch, rallied willingly but lacked the needed late kick. ROYAL 'N RANDO trailed in the early going, traveled along the inside then
came off the rail and three wide into the stretch and kept on for a minor award. JOKER BOY stalked three deep to the turn, lost positions around the bend,
remained three wide into the lane, moved in some and failed to rally. SMUGGLER'S RUN climbed along early from off the pace, entered the turn five wide,
came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF was a bit rank early the early going then settled into a stalking position four
deep, exited the turn five wide and weakened. STRAIGHT UP G stumbled leaving the gate, stalked between foes early, coaxed in the two path nearing the
turn, started to weaken around the bend, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
AVENUE bumped and had to check early, angled in on the first turn, moved out on the backstretch, got boxed in from the three-eighths to the five-sixteenths
pole, tipped out to the four path, closed fast and drove clear. BEE CATCHER had early speed from outside and angled in to duel outside ONCOMING on
the first turn, pulled and was rank early in the stretch for the first time then went up to clear inner rival and moved to the inside, opened up around the
clubhouse turn, held a diminished lead into the final turn, led clear into the stretch and got caught late. WIN THE DAY got bumped into the first turn, stalked
from inside, closed in on the leader up the backstretch, remained inside to the stretch, kept on through the lane and regained the show. ONCOMING dueled
for command from inside around the first turn, cleared briefly in the stretch for the first time then was overtaken by BEE CATCHER, chased that rival in the
middle stages, bid from outside at the three-eighths pole, could not stay alongside on the final bend, churned on through the drive and got edged for the
show. RIJEKA (IRE) bumped and was crowded between rivals early, tucked inside on the first turn at the back, steadied at the three-eighths pole, tipped out
into the stretch, altered out at the sixteenth marker and needed more late. HONOS MAN reserved from off the rail, angled four wide into the stretch and was
not a threat. FLINTMORE stalked off the inside, entered the lane three wide, bumped with the winner in upper stretch and flattened out. BIG TALKER
bumped inner rival entering the first turn, settled off the pace two wide, raced a bit off the rail leaving the final turn and made no impact. KAZAN (IRE)
chased four wide into the first turn then angled down to the two path, moved out wide on the backstretch, advanced four then five wide on the final turn and
weakened. MUHAMMAD ALI (PER) bumped and had to steady early, traveled four then three wide on the first turn, steered down to the two path, raced
three deep up the backstretch, angled in on the final turn and had little left for the drive.

SPIRIT OF MAKENA was off slow to begin, went up to press four deep, battled four deep around the turn, cleared into the stretch, met the challenge from
ONE MORE bid in the lane and kicked clear in the late stages. ONE MORE BID was off slow in the beginning, steadied a bit behind a rival early, went two
wide into the turn, angled out around the bend and took aim five wide into the stretch, challenged the winner from outside but was turned away. WESTERN
CAPE chased from inside then steered out in the lane and rallied for the show. FAMOUS STAR broke well then moved back to a tracking spot, got shuffled
between rivals past the half-mile pole, entered the stretch four to five wide and got edged for the show honors. ENCODE broke out and bumped rival hard in
the beginning, went up to take control and set the pace inside a trio of rivals, fought through the turn and was overtaken past the five-sixteenths pole, stayed
on past the quarter pole, then weakened down the lane. BAD SNEAKERS pressed three deep up the backstretch, fought through the turn, lost contact with
the winner into the stretch and weakened. AMERICAN REFUGEE brushed the gate then got bumped hard from inside and shifted in at the start and
dropped back, entered the lane five wide and failed to menace. CONQUERING KING was off slow to start, raced greenly early then got crowded between
rivals, entered the lane four wide and lacked further response. TRAEGAR broke a bit slow then went up to press the issue from between rivals, vied for
command around the bend, then gave way in the lane. UPSTART YANKEE tracked outside a rival then between foes, raced two then three wide on the turn
