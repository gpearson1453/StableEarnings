UNFAITHFUL WAYS stalked between then moved inside around the first turn, saved ground then launched a rail bid at the three-sixteenths pole, took over
in upper stretch and held gamely. DOLLY MAY (IRE) stalked three deep then two wide on the first turn, bid outside the leader two then three wide into the
stretch and finished gamely to the wire. VIRULENTE (FR) broke a step slow and bumped leaving the gate, stalked inside a pair of rivals and got put in tight
at the three-quarter pole costing some ground, shifted off the rail, chased three wide on the far turn, four wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the
show. YOUTEYOURHONOR was off slow to begin, raced two wide at the back on the first turn, moved out a bit wider on the backstretch, went four deep on
the far turn then five wide into the stretch and kept on for a minor award. SWEET TALKED broke in and bumped rival at the start, sat off the pace two wide
then three wide into the backstretch, tracked between foes leaving the backstretch, waited for room on the far turn, steered to the inside in the stretch and
needed to find more in the final sixteenth. NORAH'S PRINCESS settled on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, lost her path at the eighth pole, tipped
out and could not rally. BLUSHING (FR) was off a bit slow to begin then pulled clear, angled in on the first turn, showed the way under a hold, challenged
late on the far turn, overtaken at the top of the stretch and weakened.

MOOSE MITCHELL away quickest from the gate, dueled outside rival for command, took over at the quarter pole, cleared at the top of the stretch and drew
away. TURNSANDCONDITIONS pressed the top pair from outside early, chased four wide into the stretch, was no match for the winner in the lane but
stayed on to best the rest. PRAYER OF JABEZ bobbled at the start, chased six then five wide around the turn and edged rivals for the show. NORTHVALE
ROAD broke a step slow, chased while a bit rank early, took the turn two wide, kept on through the final furlong and missed the show. MY HARBORS
DREAM bumped leaving the gate, went up to duel inside the winner, lost command at the quarter pole but fought back to the three-sixteenths pole, could
not keep up in upper stretch and flattened in deep stretch. AXEL STEEL tracked five wide into the turn, moved into the four path then five wide entering the
stretch and failed to respond. MIGHTY MATT stalked the dueling pair from inside, asked right-handed on the turn and weakened in the drive.
MEETMEATTHECLUB broke a step slow, lost his path and action early, went five then four wide on the turn and made no impact. MAJESTIC WIND broke
out and bumped rival, chased two wide around the bend and faded. CASTLE DOCTRINE got crowded between rivals early then began to climb on the
backstretch, went two wide into the turn, came out further around the bend and was eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
ELLIE ARROWAY set the pace under pressure from outside rivals, cleared the bunch around the turn and remained clear under a few taps of right-handed
urging and strong handling. LALIC (FR) hopped at the start, went up to chase behind the leader on the inside, waited patiently around the turn, tipped out in
the drive, could not get to the winner but bested the rest. STORMING LADY settled off the leaders while still in range, raced along the rail then two wide into
the stretch, tipped out in the drive and finished willingly for third. RESPECT MY CANDOR broke a step slow, raced up close between rivals on the front end,
had to steady past the three-eighths pole, regained momentum and was closest in aim from the two path entering the stretch, chased the winner through the
final furlong but lacked a rally. MALIBU MISTRESS stalked off the rail, spun four wide into the stretch and also failed to rally. SPANISH CHANNEL pressed
four deep up the backstretch, chased the leader four then three deep on the turn and weakened. LA V. threw her head and hopped at the start spotting the
field several lengths, trailed along the inside into the turn, came out on the turn and five wide into the stretch and failed to menace. KITTY'S CANDY pressed
three deep to the turn, chased the leader between rivals and got shuffled at the quarter pole, then weakened in the lane. THERE WAS A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START OF LA V. AND RULED THAT SHE CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS AT THE START AND IS CONSIDERED A
STARTER.

Footnotes
AND TELL ME NOLIES brushed with inner rival early, pressed from inside, headed the leader at the quarter pole, battled down the stretch in a spirited duel
and dug in late to prevail. HALOSNHEAVEN set the pace under pressure to the turn, headed by AND TELL ME NOLIES at the quarter pole, responded to
the challenge and fought back through the lane but bested by the winner. ICE DANCING broke a step slow, chased at the back early, went four wide into
the turn, five wide into the lane and gained the show. INFINITE DIAMOND chased two wide into the turn, moved out to the four path around the bend, could
not summon the needed rally and got edged for the show. FLYING CONNECTION chased early then went up to press three deep leaving the backstretch,
could not match strides with the top pair leaving the bend and weakened down the lane. JENNIFER'S D'LIGHT broke a step slow, raced in range three deep
into the turn, dropped back and remained off the rail into the stretch and tired. HALF NELSON brushed early then got crowded a bit racing along the rail,
tracked inside into the turn, tipped out and came three wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

LOVESICK BLUES chased from inside through the turn, tipped out with a furlong remaining and drew clear under hand urging. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL
tracked off the rail, steadied off heels near the three-eighths pole, chased two wide into the lane, moved out in the drive and rallied for the place. PYEONG
CHANG sent from inside for the lead and cleared at the seven-sixteenths pole, met the challenge from EVENEREVENWORSE at the three-eighths pole,
moved clear again around the turn, collared by the winner at the sixteenth pole and yielded. EVENEREVENWORSE bumped leaving the gate but was still
away quickly, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid outside at the three-eighths pole, lost contact around the bend and chased in the two path
entering the stretch, kept on through the final furlong and earned a minor award. NEXT FLIGHT was off slow to begin, saved ground from off the pace
through the turn and produced a mild rally in the lane. TIZLIGHTNING broke in and bumped rival at the start, chased three wide around the turn and
weakened. SAWASDEE settled widest early, went four deep around the turn and failed to menace. GOLDEN IMAGE was off slow to begin, traveled
between rivals and three deep leaving the backstretch, got boxed in at the three-eighths pole, angled down to the two around the bend and weakened.
PHILOSOPHER'S TONE was off a bit slow, trailed two wide into the stretch and was never a factor.

HAVNAMELTDOWN broke well and took a short lead outside a pair of rivals early, dueled outside MAN CHILD into the turn, put away that rival with a
quarter mile left to run and remained clear under left and right-handed encouragement in the stretch. AGENCY in range early off the rail, went three wide
into the turn, exited the bend four wide, could not reach the winner and was clearly second best. MAN CHILD brushed leaving the gate then went up to vie
between rivals for command, dueled inside the winner into the turn, fought to the quarter pole, chased the leader into the stretch, flattened in the lane but
stayed on to hold third. POP D'ORO stumbled sharply and brushed with MAN CHILD at the start, trailed early on, went three wide into the turn, drifted six
wide leaving the bend and kept on to round out the superfecta. JIN TONG raced between rivals near the back then moved to the two path, split foes late on
the turn and improved position. FLEET FEET was off slow and bumped in the beginning, got crowded between foes early then drifted out on the
backstretch, took the turn four then five wide and lacked a rally. MARDUKAS raced four then three deep off the pace, got carried wide leaving the turn and
failed to menace. ARMAN was off slow and bumped at the start, raced greenly chasing near the inside up the backstretch, exited the turn three deep and
failed to rally. KING ADROCK broke out, vie inside rivals up the backstretch, raced in a bit tight into the turn, lost ground around the bend, eased in the lane
and walked off. QUAGMIRE MAGIC stumbled a bit at the start, raced three deep then between rivals near the back, trailed two wide into the stretch, eased
in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
SPIRIT MAKER took up between rivals then became rank early, went four wide around the first turn, stalked three deep on the backstretch, bid three deep
with three furlongs remaining, dueled with UNCLE JEFF in the late stages and dug in for the win. UNCLE JEFF was closest in pursuit off the rail on the first
turn, applied pressure from outside up the backstretch, dueled into the far turn then vied between and carried a short lead into the stretch, battled SPIRIT
MAKER to the wire and was edged for the victory. NATIONAL ROAD bumped leaving the gate, tracked three wide around the turns, tipped out in the
stretch, put in a late run but ran out of time. FLINT STROLL broke super then took a stalking a position on the inside, went two wide into the stretch, tipped
out and finished evenly late. HALFBARBERBINGIE was off slow to begin, raced at the back early, traveled three deep into the far turn, swung out leaving
the bend and summoned a mild rally. KANT BEAT THE ROCK was rank while forward early off the rail, continued to fight the rider on the backstretch,
chased between then two to three wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. MISSED CALL was rank early and bumped inner rival nearing the clubhouse turn,
tracked outside a rival on the backstretch, entered the lane two wide and lacked a rally. CAISSON got pinballed between rivals and checked early, was rank
and pulled the rider along up the backstretch, left the far turn three wide and never threatened. DISKO TRIBUTE broke in then went up to take command,
cleared and steered to the inside, set the pace under pressure in the middle stages, dueled into and around the far turn, fought to upper stretch, shifted
ground at the eighth pole and weakened. LORD ZED got bumped hard nearing the first turn, rated on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and lacked a
rally. RIMPROTECTOR off slow to begin, settled on the inside, moved off the rail and went between rivals on the backstretch before steering back to the
inside, went two wide into the drive and was not a factor. MOONSHINE STEVE was off a bit slow then became rank early, went four deep around the first
turn, pulled the rider to a closer position on the backstretch, traveled three then four deep on the far turn and weakened.
