continued its bid from the inside in the stretch, eased out to the three path late and raced along for third. BROKEN LOVE settled off the early pace, raced
near the inside at the quarter pole, shifted out five wide and had no rally. TUNED UP was slow early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and

NOT ORBINARY settled off the early pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, split rivals while racing two wide near the sixteenth pole and finished
gamely to get up under strong handling. ANNIE UP BUCK tracked the early leader while racing two wide, raced three to four wide in the stretch and just
missed in a game effort. SWEET MOOCHIE stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, moved up four to five wide through the upper stretch
and kept on to the wire. SASSY MISS MARGIE stalked the pace from the outside, raced four to three wide in the stretch run and kept on willingly to the
wire. BLARNEY GIRL showed good early speed to set the early pace and weakened a bit through the stretch run. PATSY'S BIG GIRL was unhurried early,
raced towards the outside in the drive and had no final winning bid. FED UP FIRED UP lost ground and failed to threaten.

under strong handling. POSH PLAYDAY stalked the early pace, raced three wide at the quarter pole and got up for the place position late. MS

moved up through the turn, raced four wide in the stretch run and improved position. ELIA was forwardly placed to lay up along the inside in the early going
and weakened in the stretch run. BABY DRAGON was slow early, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a rally. CHEROKEE CHATTER
stalked the pace and tired along the inside. LADY IN HEELS showed good early speed to set the pace from the outside and faltered the final furlong.

two wide and weakened through the stretch run. CHIC N WILBUR was allowed to settle early, hard ridden near the three eighths pole, raced five wide into
the upper stretch and weakened. LORD WINSALOT rated along from the inside and tired readily in the drive.

Footnotes
ADIOS BOBBY showed good early speed to set the early pace and held well to be clear late under steady handling. ALPHA PREDATOR was unhurried
early, made an advance through the far turn, raced three wide at the quarter pole, shifted out in the stretch run to race from the outside and closed well late.
CASK was coaxed along down the backstretch while racing near the inside, raced two wide in the stretch run and moved up to improve position. FARAT
stalked the pace from the outside, raced near the inside around the far turn, was near the rail in the stretch run and had not enough. MARKET MOVER
stalked the pace, raced four to five through the lane and had no final winning bid. ATLANTIC RULER was slow early, moved up near the inside at the
quarter pole, angled six wide through the stretch run and made a mild gain. NO TIME TO YAWN settled off the early pace, angled in the drive and had no
late rally. CHAOS KID tracked the pace from the outside while racing two wide and gave way. PREQUALIFIED dropped back early and failed to respond.
