Footnotes
KBCYA LATER set a pressured pace inside of a pair of hounding foes, shook clear of them entering the lane, then lasted safely to the wire. ROCK CHALK
shied severely from an outer foe in the opening stages, raced off of the pace along the inside the turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch, rallied to bid for
place at the furlong grounds, flopped back to his left lead while achieving that position at the sixteenth pole, and continued to narrow the clear leader's
margin approaching the wire. DON'T LET ME DOWN hopped slightly before being brushed between horses at the start, tracked in midpack along the inside,
picked up stride while tipping two wide turning for home, swung outside of the top trio entering the lane, vied for place outside of THREE ZERO in upper
stretch after the leader kicked clear, but required rider's correction from lugging inwardly while getting outkicked for place by an outer foe entering the final
sixteenth. THREE ZERO prompted the pace three wide, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner in upper stretch, vied for place inside of a pair of
foes in the final furlong, but yielded late. STAR ATTITUDE tracked from midpack two wide, gradually shifted five wide in midstretch, but failed to menace.
DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) tracked along the inside, but only managed to chase in upper stretch before fading through the final furlong. LEGAL CATCH
brushed with an outer foe at the start, raced far back along the inside, and never got involved. GODS GLORY broke a bit slowly before brushing with an
inner foe at the start, trailed two wide, came into the lane in the six path, and failed to factor. M. C. DOUBLE R vied for the lead two wide and from between
horses, but weakened entering the lane. EXCALIBRATE bobbled after a few strides and veered inwardly while regaining balance, tracked the top trio two
wide early on, but faded in the three path into the turn.

Footnotes
MOMA broke a step slow then had her path taken, spotted the front a few lengths, moved in down the initial straightaway, rounded the first turn in the two
path, settled inside on the backstretch, glided along the hedge while behind the runner-up on the far turn, was roused in the two path when the
aforementioned foe vacated the area at the quarter-pole, rallied passing the three-sixteenths, displayed impressive acceleration and closed fast to get the
lead between foes inside the furlong marker then moved clear under good handling in a nice debut. ROOT CAUSE dropped back while taken in hand early,
steadied along the hedge around the first turn, was reserved while saving ground, drafted along the hedge on the far turn, was roused while swinging four
wide into the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong and finished with good courage for the place. TOWHEAD bumped with a rival at the start, was
coaxed to establish early position, raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path around the far
turn, took the lead under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage inside the furlong marker and weakened but held the show. BEAUTIFULNAVIGATOR
(IRE) broke out then was corrected by the rider, raced inside to the two path under restraint around the opening bend, was well placed just off the pace,
saved ground for most of the far turn then shifted to the two path, was roused three wide into the stretch, chased while still on her inside lead in the stretch
and tired. FOREVER DIXIE steadied in the three path on the first turn, was reserved near the middle of the field, went three wide under urging on the far
turn, steadied five wide into the stretch, drifted in around the furlong marker and failed to threaten. SHESJUSTANICEGIRL was hustled from the gate, went
four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused two to three wide on the far turn then driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. CONSEILLANTE broke out and bumped with a foe, went to the front, tugging very hard under restraint while moving in early, showed the way on
the inside, was asked before the quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and gave way. SPUNK bumped with
foes on both sides at the start, was carried in early, steadied off heels along the hedge near the three-quarter pole, settled towards the back, went around
the far turn in the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. COEXIST broke out and bumped with a foe then had her path taken,
dropped well behind early, went three wide around the first turn, lagged at the back, traveled in the two path on the far turn and showed little. ASTRILA was
very rank under tight restraint on the initial straightaway, swerved out off heels around the seven-eighths then was taken up some into the first turn, raced
five wide around that bend, was reserved on the outside, went three to four wide on the far turn, swerved six wide into the stretch and was no factor.

PRAIRIE FIRE stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair entering the lane, took aim as GUNS BLAZING gained an advantage in upper stretch,
drove past that foe leaving the furlong grounds, drew clear in the final sixteenth, then just lasted from an outer on-charging rival to the wire. SHADOLAMO
lagged well behind along the inside around the turn, improved inside of rivals while in the three path in upper stretch, shifted five wide at the furlong grounds,
rallied with a good late kick in hopes of reeling in a clear PRAIRIE FIRE at the wire, but just ran out of ground. GUNS BLAZING pressed the pace two wide
around the turn, bid entering the lane, gained an advantage in upper stretch, but could not resist PRAIRIE FIRE's challenge leaving the furlong pole, and
gave way. HAPPY SOPHIA laid off of the pace two wide, split foes in that path at the five sixteenths pole, shifted four wide in midstretch, but saw the rider
unintentionally fling his crop over his mount leaving that station, got outkicked for a minor share soon after, and kept on. MISSING LINK set the pace along
the inside, but was headed by GUNS BLAZING in upper stretch, and weakened soon after before being softly struck by the lost and airborne crop of HAPPY
SOPHIA's rider inside the final furlong. BIG Q stalked three wide and between horses, but faded turning for home. CADEAU DE PAIX tracked four wide
while outside of the leading group, but also gave way with five sixteenths remaining.

Footnotes
FIRE SWORD was bumped hard at the start, recovered to establish the front, moved in outside the three-quarter pole, showed the way under pressure to
his outside, moved clear with a half-mile to run, controlled the action while two then three wide around the turn, responded well when asked at the
three-sixteenths, was given one tap of a down-turned whip into the final furlong, had the rider un-cock the crop and give one pop from the right-side near the
sixteenth-pole then was eased up late while much the best. SWIFTSURE broke in and bumped hard with FIRE SWORD, moved up to press that one on the
outside, chased three then four wide around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely secured the place while no match for the winner.
COST BASIS settled towards the front, traveled around the turn in the two path, was roused outside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a
drive and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. LAFITTE'S FLEET was urged along well off the pace, went three then four wide on the
turn, was driven five wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten. EBBEN was urged along off the pace, moved in coming to the
half-mile pole, went two then three wide around the turn and came up empty. AMERICAN POWER was sent hard from the start, steadied briefly off heels
outside the three-quarter pole when FIRE SWORD crossed in front behind the tree on the pan-camera view, chased the pace, moved out near the
nine-sixteenths, went four then five wide around the turn and had nothing left. MAGNIFICENT CHROME settled on the inside, was urged along passing the
half-mile pole, moved to the two path nearing the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. SCOTTO dropped well behind the rest of the field, moved from the
rail to the three path around the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
MRS. GREEN nudged the inside part of the gate at the start, stalked along the inside, searched for racing room while just behind the top trio in upper
stretch, bravely split those foes two wide through a very narrow seam at the furlong grounds, and swiftly shot clear. PARENTS PRIDE stalked three wide,
bid for the lead in upper stretch, vied to the furlong grounds, but was quickly outkicked by an inner bidding rival at that station, sparred with an inner
GLITTER UP for place thereafter, and prevailed. GLITTER UP set the pace inside of a vying SIXTH STREET (FR), clung to an advantage in upper stretch
as PARENTS PRIDE joined the fray, got headed approaching the furlong grounds by that rival, then failed to resist MRS. GREEN's challenge at that
junction, kept on to battle for place, but was bested. SIXTH STREET (FR) vied for the lead two wide, then from between horses in upper stretch, but was
outkicked by an inner rival at the furlong grounds, and yielded. YAMAS laid off of the pace in the two path into the turn, inched closer while shifting out to the
five path nearing the lane, but failed to sustain that rally and made no bid. LIBRETTO (IRE) settled towards the back along the inside, came into the lane in
the three path, but failed to factor. SHE'S ALL CLASS raced far back in the two path, and never got involved. LINEAR THINKING (IRE) broke a step slowly
before being crowded in a bit of tight quarters between horses at the start, trailed along the inside, and was outrun. SHE'S STORMY tracked two wide while
in the three path around the turn, but was fanned to the six path entering the lane, and weakened.

CHOCOLATE GELATO broke very fast then was hustled, showed the way while well off the inside, dictated terms in the two path around the turn,
responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, extended the advantage in upper stretch, widened under a brisk hand-ride to the sixteenth-pole then was
eased up while much the best. TWIN MISCHIEF came in at the start then brushed with a foe, dropped back under urging, raced inside to the two path
around the turn and just got up for the place while no match for the winner. TAKE CHARGE BRIANA broke out but was away fast then corrected by the
rider, raced just off the pace, was taken in hand near the half-mile pole, dropped back between horses in the two path at the seven-sixteenths, chased from
that point, shifted four wide outside the five-sixteenths, was driven five wide into the stretch and just missed the place while clear for the show.
INTERPOLATE broke towards the rear of the field then was hustled, moved up on the inside, steadied at the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn, was
driven three wide into the stretch and came up empty. ALWAYS LAUGHING settled on the outside, was urged along in the three path around the turn and
was no factor. ROYAL POPPY lost her footing at the start then bumped with a foe, chased the pace down the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, spun
four wide into the stretch and tired. UPPER CASE bumped with a rival just after the start, was shuffled back some some behind TWIN MISCHIEF and other
foes under tight restraint early, moved out under a snug hold behind horses, was roused five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to
respond. FIRING BULLETS was hustled from the start then urged along on the outside, dropped back four then five wide around the turn and faltered then
was distanced in the final furlong.

Footnotes
OUT OF SIGHT saved ground in midpack along the inside, shifted to the two path around the far turn while intently tracking the leading group, tipped five
wide and outside of those foes in upper stretch, rallied with a good kick in the final furlong to bid for the lead leaving the sixteenth pole, and edged ahead.
HOME FOR CHRISTMAS stalked along the inside while just off of the top pair, tugged entering the first turn and brushed an outer SPUNGIE, loomed a
danger from the pocket around the far turn, aimed to split the embattled leading pair in upper stretch, inched between them approaching the furlong
grounds, but steadied briefly when the hole narrowed around him at that marker, tentatively moved forward while regaining momentum soon after, produced
a bid in the final sixteenth while brushing an inner foe, but was outfinished by an outer rallying rival late while gaining place. MY LIPS ARE SEALED pressed
the leader from the outside, bid turning for home, vied while a path away from her inner counterpart in upper stretch, sparred well into the final furlong, but
was outkicked by an outer foe while losing place to an inner rival nearing the wire. LADY THORNHILL settled far back two wide, tipped six wide in upper
stretch, but hung on her left lead through midstretch, changed over entering the final sixteenth, and moved up late. SPUNGIE was brushed by an inner rival
into the first turn while tracked two wide, tipped outside of the top pair at the three furlong pole while just off their flanks, floated four wide in upper stretch,
chased into midstretch, progressed in the final furlong as an outer OUT OF SIGHT ranged up alongside, threatened a bid nearing the final sixteenth, but
flopped back to his left lead at that marker, quickly stalled out, and hung for a minor share. PALACE GOSSIP set the pace in the two path, then along the
inside around the far turn before meeting MY LIPS ARE SEALED's challenge nearing the lane, gamely resisted that foe through upper stretch, maintained
an advantage inside the final furlong, but was brushed by an outer rival at the sixteenth pole, and readily gave way. CHOOSE HAPPINESS broke a step
slowly while brushing the gate, trailed early on, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, and narrowed the gap on the main group. INSTINCTIVE got antsy
in the gate awaiting the start, sat reserved along the inside, and never got involved. PAY GRADE broke a bit slowly, raced in midpack three to two wide
around the first turn, but faded three wide around the far turn, was done early, and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
BETSY BLUE bumped with a rival at the start then was crowded between foes, moved out near the five-eighths pole, stalked outside from that juncture,
ranged up four then three wide on the turn, made a bid with three furlongs to run, took the lead at the quarter-pole, was asked for her best while still on her
inside lead in upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and drew away while continuing on her inside lead under steady urging to prove much the best.
BRATTLE HOUSE went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path around the turn, was asked under threat around the
five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner into the stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while well clear for
the place. SWEET WILLEMINA was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, battled with HALO
CITY for the show in the final furlong and narrowly earned that position while no threat to the top two. HALO CITY was last to commence, dropped well
behind under urging, saved ground early on the turn, shifted three wide before the five-sixteenths, moved to four then five wide later on that bend, came six
wide into the stretch and just missed the show. SWEET SOLARE broke out and bumped with a foe, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in
the two path, was driven four wide into the stretch, drifted out outside the furlong marker and failed to respond. HONEY MONEY moved up on the inside
then was rated just off the pace, saved ground while asked on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty. FOREVER DREAMING
bobbled outward at the start but broke towards the front, tracked the pace on the outside, came up empty in the three path on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
BIG INVASION rated kindly off of the quick pace, saved ground during the early part of the bend, gradually shifted four wide turning for home, then
responded readily when let out a notch via shaken reins in upper stretch, quickened to bid leaving the furlong grounds, and assumed command entering the
final sixteenth before being put to wraps approaching the wire. CADAMOSTO (IRE) stalked along the inside while pursuing the leader from a few lengths off,
shifted outside of that foe nearing the lane, grinded away to bid approaching the furlong grounds, briefly led passing that marker, drifted out soon after while
an outer BIG INVASION loomed a danger, but quickly proved no match for that foe entering the final sixteenth, and held place. DETERMINED KINGDOM
laid off of the pace two wide, inched closer while shifting three wide turning for home, sustained a grinding charge while between horses in midstretch, but
shied mildly from an inner drifting foe approaching the final sixteenth, flopped back to his left lead while getting outkicked by his outer rallying counterpart in
the process, then kept on, but was denied reaching place. SKY AND SAND settled at the rear along the inside, came into the lane in the three path, hung on
his left lead while moving up in midstretch, then changed over entering the final sixteenth to sustain his improvment. SURPRISE BOSS took a bump from an
inner foe at the start, saved ground in midpack around the turn, but tired. THAT'S RIGHT brushed an outer foe at the start, yet quickly cleared soon after,
but hung on his left lead in upper stretch as a trio of foes closed in, and was overhauled at the furlong pole. EDITORIAL COMMENT (ARG) raced at the rear
two wide, took the turn in the three path, but was outrun.

Footnotes
BRAZILLIONAIRE showed early speed towards the hedge, was taken back off the pace nearing the first turn, raced inside to the two path under restraint
around that bend, was rated just off the pace under a snug hold, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, gained to make
a bid outside the furlong marker, fought with the runner-up to near the sixteenth-pole then moved clear in the final sixteenth under strong urging. RELATE
was corrected with the left-rein at the start, angled in while going to the front, showed the way in the two path, responded well when put to a drive in upper
stretch, dug in under challenge from the winner coming to the furlong marker, fought on well into the final sixteenth but was outfinished while clear for the
place. WAR STRATEGY was taken up while rank under restraint behind BRAZILLIONAIRE as that one was taken back into the first turn, saved ground
while reserved off the pace, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive while moving off the hedge in upper stretch and lacked the needed
kick while able to get the show. RECKLESS SPIRIT was taken up while rank under restraint into the first turn, went around that bend in the three path, was
reserved on the outside, came under urging leaving the backstretch, was urged two then three wide around the far turn and lacked the needed response.
SEAVER broke out and hit the gate, went three wide around the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, chased two to three wide on the far turn, drifted
inward in upper stretch and tired. F F ROCKET broke awkwardly then bumped hard with a foe, was rank and taken up under stout restraint into the first turn,
saved ground under reserve towards the back and failed to threaten. HATCH was bumped hard on both sides at the start, became rank behind foes nearing
the first turn, was reserved in the two to three path, moved out while hanging on his inside lead in upper stretch, continued on his inside lead in the drive and
failed to rally. MOON HUNTER stumbled inward at the start then bumped hard with foe before being pulled off that rival with a tug of the right-rein, went
three wide on the turns, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DOCTOR LOVE was bumped hard at the start then forced into another foe
and taken up, spotted the front several lengths, lagged at the rear while in the two path on the turns and trailed.
