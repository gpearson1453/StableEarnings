Footnotes
SCIENCE FRICTION settled off the pace while racing three wide, inched closer through the lane and was up in deep stretch. RAISON THE GLASS dueled
two wide down the backstretch, drew clear around the turn, held clear past the eighth pole and led until the final strides. PEARLINTHEROUGH lacked early
speed, raced four wide around the turn, drifted out several times under left-handed urging in the lane, straightened out right-handed pressure in deep stretch
and was quickly gaining late. THE JOKES ON ME failed to menace while racing two wide. HONORARY GUEST chased the pace two wide and was through
after a half. STACIAS RUBY vied inside down the backstretch and faltered around the turn. MONTANA JOYCE had only brief speed inside.

Footnotes
DOWNTON TABBY set the pace in the two path, drifted out in upper stretch and held firm under a drive. GIRLY THE BUTCHER had early speed inside of
the winner, rated back down the backstretch, angled out nearing the far turn, raced three wide around that bend, continued on the left lead in the lane and
rallied outside. CROSS FLEET saved ground in range and kept on inside of the winner to hold third. LOVE MY JOB was bumped and forced to check
sharply soon after the start, pulled five wide around the first turn, dueled outside of the winner down the backstretch and around the far turn, continued on
the left lead in the lane and weakened. DUBSTEP soundly bumped with LOVE MY JOB soon after the start, raced four wide throughout and lacked the
needed rally. INES'S HATS bumped early, stalked the pace three wide and faded around the far turn. ARTEMUS SWEETHEART threw her head at the start
to get off last and trailed inside.

MARACAS BAY set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. CHAIRWOMAN pressed the winner two wide and was clearly second best.
CANDYMONIUM chased the pace from the rail, lacked the needed rally and was up for a share of the show. OTUMBA stalked the pace three wide and had
no response. DISCO QUEEN played no factor while racing two wide. SHEMIGHTDANCESALSA broke awkwardly, raced five wide and made little impact.
BYZANTINE EMPIRE was outrun while racing four wide.
