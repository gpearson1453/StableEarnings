Footnotes
AMERICAN UNION stalked just outside the first flight through the backstretch, advanced readily three deep nearing the turn to challenge for command
midway through the bend, went clear under pressure racing into the stretch and was taken in hand in the final sixteenth once the issue was decided. MAGIC
CARPET was settled last racing to the turn, switched out three wide entering the stretch and continued with late interest to prevail for second late. THE Z
MAN, urged inside a rival disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. TURN THE SWITCH broke readily, forced
the pace outside a rival from the outset into the turn and gave way once headed by the winner in upper stretch. PER RULING #C22042 FROM THE
MINNESOTA RACING COMMISSION, THE Z MAN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 3rd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
SHE'S WANDAFUL, in touch prompting a rival's pace from the outset to the backstretch, took over leaving the far turn and widened under firm
encouragement. PRANCE angled to the inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance to the backstretch, saved ground into the stretch and
edged a rival for the place honors late. DAIGLE angled to the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage from the outset to the backstretch, dueled
inside the eventual winner into the far turn and gave way entering the lane while shifting off the inside. AUNT RUTHIE switched out three wide racing into
the first turn while being prompted to a forward placing, lodged a brief bid in that path entering the far turn but gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
NEW DICE, off slowly, settled along the inside on the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, then rallied along the rail through the stretch to wrest a
clear advantage in time under firm handling. COAL TOWN ROAD, urged along the inside disputing the pace in the opening stages, shook clear racing into
the turn, held sway on a comfortable margin past midstretch but faltered late. BOSTON WALLY angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing into the
turn, tipped out three wide racing through the stretch and finished evenly late while earning a share. PERIPATETIC tracked off the first flight three wide
racing into the turn, shifted in entering the lane but continued with an effort to gain some position. SILENT SAILOR joined the pace three wide in the opening
stages, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter into the turn, then gave way into upper stretch. BON DEUX settled into stride off the second flight while
switching outside foes on the backstretch and proved no threat. EL JEFE COBB flashed brief pace between foes prompting the leader to the turn but gave
way early. FOLLOWING THE THIRD RACE, THE REMAINING CARD WAS CANCELLED DUE TO TRACK CONDITION.
