Footnotes
AMBER PRINCESS unhurried early, gained closer order nearing the stretch, dug in late and got up just in time. THE RIVER GREY vied four wide leaving
the chute, held a slim lead through the far turn, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, turned back challenge from SAVYSKYE then weakened in
the final yards and was rundown before the wire. I'MANIMPERIALGIRL saved in second flight, took closer order approaching the final turn, lodged a rail bid
and missed. SAVYSKYE vied inside, angled outside in the far turn, moved up alongside THE RIVER GREY to challenge the lead near the quarter pole, was
unable to get by and gave way grudgingly between foes. MISS DIRECTED saved ground while four wide, dropped back and gave way. SCARLETTE ROSE
was not a factor.

Footnotes
TAKE NO PRISONERS sat in striking position from the three path, moved up alongside WITHIN REASON to challenge the lead, and drew clear late stretch.
ESTIFRAAD raced at the back of the pack, hustled off the final turn, rallied through the stretch under handling, and was along in time for place honors.
OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR chased outside leaving the backstretch, rallied four wide through stretch, and finished well for show. WITHIN REASON quickly
went to the front, was overtaken by TAKE NO PRISONERS and flattened. GREAT VISION tracked inside, and lacked the kick needed. BEAUGATTI chased
three wide into the opening turn, and faded.

Footnotes
NORTHERNLOCOMOTIVE was quickest to the turn, showed the way through the backstretch in the three path, was given cue at the quarter pole, drew off
under a strong hand ride and was geared down. ACE OF DIAMONDS lagged early, took closer order into the far turn, closed steadily from the rail, and was
along for place. OUR DANDY'S BOY rated off the pace in the two path, went in pursuit of the leader but was no match for the winner in the stretch then was
rundown deep stretch. WITT'SDOLLARNIGHT unhurried early, chased and was unable to improve position in the drive. ITS ALL ON SLEW settled back in
the three path, hustled off the final turn, and failed to threaten. ADMIRAL VANNGO hurried away, sat in range outside, fanned four wide in the far turn, and
faded into the lane. PREDESTINED sat just off the pacesetter in the four to five paths, and was done early.

Footnotes
FLORIST was rank lacking running room early, drove three wide at the quarter pole, and drew clear in the stretch. NO COLLUSION sat just off the pace
while in the five path, swung five wide off the final turn, made a good run outside and was along for place position. CARRIE'S SUCCESS trailed the field,
advanced quickly approaching the final turn, drove inside into the stretch, and flattened late. CHATTY GAL quickest leaving the chute, set a pressured pace
inside of EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE, was under attack at the head of the stretch, and yielded. EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE prompted the pace from the three path,
moved up alongside CHATTY GAL nearing the quarter pole but was unable to move on with the fore mentioned and faded gradually. FLASHY BIZ sat in
striking range from the five path, and came up empty in drive. TALA offered little, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
QUINTO SOL sat just off the pace under a snug hold, inherited the lead nearing the quarter pole then drew off through the stretch, and was ridden out.
BUCK WEST saved ground early, advanced on the rail in the final turn, kept on steadily through stretch and got by in time. WYE CROSS settled inside,
angled out to the three path, chased the eventual winner through the stretch and was nipped at the wire. SILVERFOOT trailed the field, shifted outside into
the stretch, and offered a late mild bid. BODEMONSTER sat in striking distance, and passed tiring rivals. EFFORTLESS set a pressured pace, was
overtaken and wilted. CHESTER SLEW stalked three wide leaving the opening turn, and tired.

BOOTIFUL ROSE vied outside, held a slim advantage over FASTESTGIRLINTOWN through the final turn, drew clear approaching the stretch, and was
kept under light handling. SINGING BELL bumped leaving, vied inside from the four path, lodged a rail bid and stayed on evenly through the stretch for
place. FASTESTGIRLINTOWN broke outward, vied outside then fanned three wide into the opening turn, loomed boldly near the three sixteenth pole, and
was unable to improve through the drive and finished even. YOGA RULER lacked the early speed needed, and bid belatedly. GOLDIE SOCKS was
outsprinted to the turn, dropped back and failed to menace. ECHO CREEK flashed early speed, raced four to five wide into the turn, and lacked a kick. LIKE
GOLD broke inward and was outrun. GO AGARTHA chased outside throughout.

Footnotes
SHORTY THE SWEDE showed early speed then sat just off the pacesetter, given cue near the three sixteenth marker, and edged away under handling.
WILDCAT WILLY reserved off the early pacesetters, rallied three wide through stretch, and dug in getting up for place. FAST EH set the pace from the two
path, lacked the close needed into the lane and was caught late. HIGH KELLY SONG angled to the rail in the early stages, improved into the stretch and
finished evenly. SNAP COUNT advanced outside leaving the final turn, and lacked kick needed. RAVINA LANE hurried away, and failed to threaten in drive.
ICE BOX INDY lugged out in the early stages, dropped back in the final turn and gave way. FOREVER JIMMY brushed leaving, and was unable to recover
ground needed.

Footnotes
SMOKEDYA attended the pace from the five path, cut the corner into the far turn, drew away in the final turn, and pulled off to good margins with intermittent
reminders. PERPETUAL BLISS lagged early, advanced quickly inside through the final turn, improved through stretch and just held under a late drive.
LASKA lacked clear path leaving then was gapped, closed steadily outside into the stretch, and just missed out for place. THIS TIME SWEETIE fractious in
gate, reserved off the pacesetters, drove three wide off the final turn, and rallied mildly late. LIL MISS MUD vied between, sat just off the pace in the two
path, chased into the lane, and gave way in the final furlong. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL saved mid pack in the four path, chased outside and improve position
late. TAKE ME TO BATTLE fractious in gate, settled inside just off the pace, and came up empty in the drive. ZHAVIA lacked early speed, and never
reached contention. SPARK PLUG offered little. INDIAN GIRL flashed early speed and tired.
