Footnotes
DOCTOR WU received an unfair start and was refunded. INVISIBLE FRIEND was off slow, a factor on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the
stretch drew clear. ROYAL BIZ set the pace, had the lead on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. VOYANT was in
range and raced evenly on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch needed more. WE WANT ACTION was off the pace, had a mild gain on
the turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch was up for a share. GUNZIG STINGER was in touch and roused on the turn but from the six path at
the top of the stretch had no response. M C JACKHAMMER stalked the early leader but lost ground on the turn and had nothing left. TWICE AS SMART
had no speed, trailed on the turn and was never in contention. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START RESULTED IN DOCTOR WU BEING
DECLARED A NON STARTER AND REFUNDED. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON GUNZIG STINGER AGAINST INVISIBLE FRIEND FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.
