QUICK TEMPO set a quick tempo, was roused and opened up from the two path at the top of the lane, and held gamely. TRASHTALKINYANKEE trailed
from the two path, was cued while swinging three wide into the stretch, and ran on for place. HIDE THE DEMON tracked in the three path, floated four wide
into the stretch, and improved for show. STEINBECK stalked inside, was coaxed while saving ground into the stretch, but weakened. UBIQUITOUS pressed
two wide, was ridden between foes into the stretch, but was empty.

Footnotes
GALILEI saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, split horses
at the eighth pole and pulled clear. DETERMINED EMPIRE trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the
turn from the two and three path, swung wide while beginning a bid entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside late. AFRAID NOT raced in the
two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn still in the two path and finished evenly
between horses. FORETELL raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, began a bid from the three path coming around
the far turn and flattened out in the lane. MELIPONINI BEE saved ground around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and
around the second bend and faded in the final furlong. SEARCH hopped up leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early
going, continued to save ground around the far turn and was empty in the stretch while drifting out mildly. BESSIE BLUE raced in the two path around the
first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, navigated the far turn from the two path and made no bid. REIGN OF LOVE hopped up
leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to battle on the outside around the
far turn, dropped back quickly approaching the quarter pole and tired in the stretch.

STACK SHACK set a loose lead, was coaxed when headed at the top of the stretch, and held on willingly. KINDA LUCKY stalked from the two path, bid
while two wide at the top of the stretch, but hung for place. WINDY CITY GIRL raced in midpack while two wide, was roused from the three path into the
stretch, but finished evenly to show. CLASSY OF COURSE raced from well back in the two path, was ridden along from the three path at the top of the
stretch, but was one paced. RAISON D'ETAT GIRL trailed while two wide, was in the four path at the top of the stretch, but was never a factor. R
TENDERONI rated from inside but never threatened. MISS MORENO tracked from inside but backed out around the far turn.

Footnotes
KING'S LEGACY saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two
path, pulled clear with a furlong to go and just held off the closers while drifting late. MAXINE MACHINE raced inside at the back of the pack through the
opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path and gained ground steadily on the outside to the wire to just miss. HIGH VIBES bumped with the
horse to her outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground
around the far turn, switched to the outside in midstretch and dueled in tight quarters to the wire to just miss. JOYA DEL SUR saved ground around the first
turn, led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. HIGHWAY QUEEN was blocked up and took
up sharply leaving the gate, dropped in to save ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from
the two path and improved position mildly in the lane. SCHATZI raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to
save ground around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. SAFE TRAVELS bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the
two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch and around the far turn and faded in the lane. MUSIC QUEEN raced in the two path in
the early going, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, saved ground around the second bend and faded from there. SWEET ANNABELLA
saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and came up
empty in the stretch. AUTOSTRADA raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was
not a factor. THE RIDERS OF HORSES FIVE, HIGH VIBES AND HORSE TEN, MAXINE MACHINE BOTH FILED OBJECTIONS CITING INTERFERENCE
IN LATE STRETCH FROM THE WINNER, KING'S LEGACY. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS ALSO MADE INTO THIS MATTER. UPON REVIEW, NO
CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
TOLAGA BAY tracked while two wide, swept three wide to bid at the top of the lane, opened up in upper stretch, and held on. DANIEL SUN stalked from the
two path, waited for room rounding the far turn, tipped three wide into the stretch, rallied for place but just missed top honors. CARLOUN (IRE) rated inside,
was roused while floating into the five path coming into the stretch, and ran on for show. CHINA BEACH trailed, saved ground into the stretch, and improved
position late. NOBLE CROSS pressed in the two path, was ridden between rivals into the stretch, but faded. CHAOTIC TEMPO set the pace inside, was
coaxed heading into the stretch, but yielded. AZURE SKY raced from well back in the three path and was done early.

Footnotes
CONNAGH'S QUAY stalked inside, made a bid entering the far turn, opened up at the top of the lane, and just held on. PACIFIST rated in the two path, was
coaxed four wide at the top of the lane, and rallied down the center for place. ROBERT'S LUXURY trailed from the four path, was driven two wide into the
stretch, and ran on for show. WRESTLINGWITHRAE (IRE) led from the two path early, was ridden inside rounding the far turn, but faded into the stretch.
ROMP tracked from the two path, was cued from the four path rounding the far turn, but flattened. SA'AD (FR) prompted the pace from two wide but
weakened into the stretch. MACHENBANK (GER) raced from well back in the three path and never threatened. BEOWULF (IRE) raced in midpack from the
two path but backed out around the far turn.

Footnotes
WHO'S COUNTING raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening mile and a half, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, took
command on the outside and drew off under a hand ride to win easily. MR. BRIDGER led the field the first time around the oval, opened up on lap two, was
caught entering the stretch and chased the winner home. NEW APPOINTMENT (IRE) chased the leader through the opening mile, moved up to challenge
coming around the final turn and flattened out in the lane. JUMP SHIP trailed the field on the outside for most of the race, passed a tiring rival in the final half
mile and made no bid. FEARSOME (GB) raced off the pace on the inside throughout and tired in the final half mile.
