Footnotes
HOLLYWOOD HENRY was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with ON A WARPATH while racing three-wide, vied with that rival into deep
stretch and drew clear through the closing yards. ON A WARPATH was hustled along to dispute the pace with the winner from the inside, vied with that rival
but could not match strides in the final yards. CERVEZA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with good
late energy. DIABOLICAL GATOR was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and failed to threaten.
GOLDEN BAND showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out with a furlong to run and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CHEESE TRAY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths pole, was
taken on by THUNDER DOME inside the furlong marker, vied with that rival, drifted out through the final sixteenth and held gamely. THUNDER DOME was
allowed to settle early, moved four-wide through the first turn, advanced five-wide through the second turn, reached CHEESE TRAY nearing the sixteenth
pole, was carried out by that foe and could not get by. ONE MARK was away in good order to press the pace of B A CHAMPION from the inside, moved up
to take command nearing the half and gave way after going three-quarters. DELBERT TOO raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn
and finished evenly in the drive. B A CHAMPION broke sharply to set a pressured pace and weakened after going five furlongs. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AND INQUIRY AND THE RIDER OF THUNDER DOME MADE AN OBJECTION AGAINST CHEESE TRAY CONCERNING THE DRIFTING
OUT THROUGH THE FINAL SIXTEENTH OF CHEESE TRAY AND FORCING THUNDER DOME OUT AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS, THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED CHEESE TRAY FROM FIRST AND PLACED HIM SECOND.
