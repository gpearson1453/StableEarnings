Footnotes
HOWYABUD (IRE) saved ground under reserve while jumping well early, was nudged inside the course by DECISIVE TRIUMPH after fence five then made
her way back onto the course while moving back behind the aforementioned foe, had the rider fall forward completing fence seven then moved out while the
rider regained equilibrium, brushed with a foe at the foot of fence eight, made a bid in the two path, vied outside around the final turn, fought with DECISIVE
TRIUMPH in upper stretch, lugged inward in the final furlong and prevailed in the end. DECISIVE TRIUMPH came away in front then quickly sped clear,
jumped reasonably well while setting a solid pace, tossed her head slightly over a couple fences while showing the way, came under strong urging after
fence eight, vied along the cones while inside of the winner on the far turn, fought on gamely with that foe in the stretch but missed while clear for the place
in a good effort. GOING COUNTRY (IRE) started near the back of the field, struggled badly jumping near the rear, was urged along after fence four,
remained near the back through the final turn and got up for the show. PERFECT TAPATINO (FR) was taken in hand early, jumped well while off the pace,
brushed with a foe just before leaving the ground coming to fence eight, was urged along around the final turn and came up empty. LYDFORD (GB) began
at the rear of the field, struggled over fence two, was reserved near the back while jumping reasonably well thereafter, was ridden along on the final turn and
failed to respond. BURN THE EVIDENCE (GB) jumped well on the outside, was taken up by the rider while taking short strides after fence five then
departed the course before being vanned off.

Footnotes
GLITTERING PRIZE three wide just off the duel upfront, came under coaxing latched on the top pair near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into
upper stretch, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths and dug in head to head gamely fending off the runner up to prevail inching away at the end.
LAUGHTER broke out at the start bumping FULIGNI, dueled inside of that rival coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch under threat, got headed at the three-sixteenths, dug in fighting on to the finish but was ultimately staved off while along well clear of the rest and
second best. FROSTY INVASION broke out at the start bumping DARN THAT SONG, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just
off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors
while never threatening the top pair. DARN THAT SONG bumped at the start by FROSTY INVASION, who broke outwards, raced just off the duelers six
paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong.
DOROTHY'S THE BOSS six to seven paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, went five then four wide through the turn under coaxing from
three furlongs out, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. ACE UP HER SLEEVE coaxed from the gate, chased four paths off the inside until
tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. YOGI
chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, made no impact. FULIGNI bumped at the start by
LAUGHTER, who broke outwards, dueled from the two path with that rival to her inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into
upper stretch and tired. MIKE'S LITTLE DIVA coaxed from the gate, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide for home and faltered.

Footnotes
LEDDY bumped with a rival at the start, chased the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, gained to take the lead into upper stretch,
shook clear under one pop of a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, was given one pop of a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then
placed under a solid hand-ride to the wire while much the best. PRINTRACK came away in front then was hustled, showed the while while lugging out some
well off the inside, moved in late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, lost the lead to the winner into upper stretch and proved no match
while clear for the place. NEVER EARLY bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was coaxed four wide around the turn, came under the crop
while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. NOT YET CHARLIE was bumped soundly by
READY TO MARCH at the start then taken up off the heels of that foe with a tug of the right-rein, spotted the field a few lengths while slow into stride, was
urged along on the outside, went two then three wide early on the turn, moved to four then five wide later on that bend and failed to rally. RAW COURAGE
was ridden along near the back, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and failed to threaten. READY TO MARCH was fractious then broke open
the front of his stall doors but remained in the gate, came out at the start and bumped soundly with NOT YET CHARLIE, chased the pace down the
backstretch, dropped back inside on the turn and faltered.

CHARGE ACCOUNT tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing tipped to the two path five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch in behind the leader and was forced to pause at the three-sixteenths awaiting a seam, got that seam a furlong out as ADELAIDE MISS drifted
in slightly and burst on through roused inside that station loosely splitting rivals to quickly offer a challenge and take command forty yards from home and
was up to prevail at the end. ADELAIDE MISS lightly coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive drifting in slightly a furlong out, came under quick challenge and was caught
in the late stages and forced to settle for the place honors. GOLDEN VOICE lightly coaxed from the gate, settled in closest pursuit of the leader while just off
the inside, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to secure the show honors. JASMINESQUE raced under a
hard hold off the heels of the leader through the first turn before settling to track that rival from the pocket, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole
and was set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, kept on inside to the finish. CARRY ON three then two wide through the first turn, chased two to
three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. WAR CANOE tracked two to three
wide through the first turn and down the backstretch before tipping three then four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled five to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SHADOLAMO saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from
home, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
SOSUA SUMMER was hustled from the gate then placed under light restraint early, established a good position just off the pace, drafted behind the leader
while inside on the turn, shifted four wide while asked at the quarter-pole, rallied outside to make a bid in upper stretch, gained a short advantage at the
furlong marker then drew clear under steady urging. JAVA BUZZ tracked the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was roused
three wide into the stretch, took a short lead before the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while
able to get the place. UPPER LEVEL was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was asked late on that bend,
spun into the two path entering the stretch then lost the advantage to the runner-up, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but held
the show. ROCKET'S RED GLARE hit the inside of the gate at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, settled under some urging, moved
from the rail to the two path around the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, came in some while hanging on his inside lead around the
three-sixteenths then swapped to the proper lead and lacked the needed response. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE was forced out at the start, settled on the
outside at the rear, moved in late on the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and failed to threaten. TRIUMPHANT ROAD broke a step slow, was
urged along near the back, rounded the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to rally. SUL PHAROAH broke out then was
corrected by the rider, chased the pace on the outside, went three then four wide around the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and capitulated.

LADY JASMINE two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command a furlong from home, then inched away through the final sixteenth kept to task to the wire. SMOKIE EYES three wide in pursuit from just off the
pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. COLLABORATION established
the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside seven-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch under threat, dug in and was collared a furlong out, kept on to preserve the show honors. AMANDA'S FOLLY tracked the
pace along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SWEETEST
PRINCESS lunged to right side hitting the off side stall at the start and getting away last conceding four to five lengths to the front before crossing directly to
the rail, raced along the inside through the first turn before tracking the front from the two path near the rear of the field down the backstretch, continued just
off the inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. BERNT AGAIN
lunged slightly at the break hitting the off side stall at the start before being hard held off the heels of COLLABORATION soon after the start but conceding
only about a length or two before settling into stride, tracked the front from near the rear of the field coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, took
the inside route into upper stretch and offered no response. DREAM ON CARA just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide behind the cover
of a rival before tipping four wide put to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went four then three wide through the far turn urged along, angled in to spin just off

Footnotes
TIERGAN dropped back in the two path around the first turn, was rated off the pace while off the rail, ranged up on the far turn, made a bid outside the
five-sixteenths then took a short lead, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole, was asked while floating three to four wide into upper stretch then shaken up
lightly outside the eighth-pole, widened under a mild-hand ride in the final furlong and proved much the best. TROUBLESHOOTER went four then three
wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along passing the five-eighths, rounded the far turn under strong encouragement, gained passing the
five-sixteenths, was driven four wide into the stretch, swapped back to his inside lead nearing the furlong marker and safely secured the place while no
match for the winner. DADDY KNOWS was sent hard from the start, lugged out some while two then three wide around the opening bend, tracked the pace
down the backstretch, chased three wide around the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. BAR FOURTEEN was last to commence then hustled,
moved up three then two wide on the first turn to take the lead, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path early on the far turn, lost the lead
while moving closer to the rail at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and faded. BLEWITT was coaxed five then four wide around the first turn,
settled on the outside, moved closer with six furlongs to run, was urged four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and faltered. VINTAGE

DOT'S DOLLAR established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under pressure into the far turn and floated his
main rival three wide briefly at the three-eighths before tucking back to the two path, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was
shown an off side crop while directed out under left handed urging, herded his main danger three to four paths out through the final furlong while flashing the
crop in the face of SWIFT TAP as a deterrent, then came out at the finish shouldering him just after the wire while holding on by a neck. SWIFT TAP broke
in at the start bumping HAGLER solidly into IRON LION IN ZION, raced four wide in aim before tucking three wide and advancing on the leader into the turn
to apply pressure to the outside, got floated four wide by that rival briefly three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to latch
on straightened away, dug in under a drive getting herded out three to four paths through to the finish while being flashed that rival's crop to the face and
was rebuffed to the line when shouldered by DOT'S DOLLAR as they crossed and just after the finish. BUCKINGHAM PRINCE chased two to three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. MUST BE LOVE got bumped at the
start by SILIPO and traded leans with that foe, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from
the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly with a mild bid. SUGAR GRAY LEONARD coaxed from the gate, chased four
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths and weakened. HAGLER got bumped at the start solidly by SWIFT TAP and in turn bumped IRON LION IN
ZION, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into
upper stretch and made no impact. SILIPO broke out at the start bumping MUST BE LOVE, then traded leans with that rival, chased three wide down the
backstretch before going five wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued five wide for home and made no impact. FREE
SQUARE chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, tired. IRON LION IN ZION got bumped
sideways at the start by HAGLER due to pressure from SWIFT TAP breaking inwards, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run as well as a Jockey's Objection by
the rider of SWIFT TAP alleging interference against DOT'S DOLLAR. After review, it was deemed that DOT'S DOLLAR had not interfered with SWIFT TAP,
the result was allowed to stand and the objection was dismissed prior to the race being declared official.

lugged out into that bend, saved ground under reserve at the back, was roused outside the quarter-pole, moved to the two path in upper stretch, angled out
into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. ROCKY SKY (IRE) was last to commence then bumped with a foe, saved ground while reserved off

inside into the final furlong, squeezed through to make a rail bid outside the sixteenth-pole, fought on well to the wire but missed while just able to get the
place. PRINCESS FAWZIA saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused while shifting from the rail to the three path on the far turn, came

show. AMERICAN BRIDGE (GB) sped away down the initial straightaway, went around the first turn in the two path, showed the way off the rail, vied in the

Footnotes
CATHEDRAL BEACH bumped at the start by FLIPPING FUN, who broke outwards, raced six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the
duel, tucked four wide briefly before going three wide through the turn advancing to issue a challenge five-sixteenths from home, got set down spinning
three to four wide into upper stretch and seized command with three-sixteenths to go, then drew clear under a drive to prevail. GINNSU WARRIOR three to
four wide in pursuit, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top one and just held on for the place honors over a late charging rival. BRACIOLE coaxed from the get go, chased four then three wide,
angled six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly but missed for the place honors. ARTHURIAN bobbled at the start then got bumped by YONO
breaking outwards, dueled five then four paths off the inside with PRINCE OF JOY to his inside, tucked to the two path through the turn and took over
command at the three-eighths before coming under pressure from CATHEDRAL BEACH to the outside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was
displaced from command at the three-sixteenths, then weakened to the finish. YONO broke out at the start bumping ARTHURIAN, chased along the inside
under coaxing from the half mile pole, angled four wide for home and made no impact. PRINCE OF JOY coaxed from the gate, dueled three then two wide
with ARTHURIAN to the outside down the backstretch and through the turn, tucked inside through the turn and was headed three furlongs from home, got
coaxed along in retreat nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. FLIPPING FUN broke out at the start bumping
CATHEDRAL BEACH, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home and tired. SIXTY THREE S coaxed
from the start, chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, continued along the inside into upper stretch and tired.
