Footnotes
NO MORE TALK tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and dueled
down the lane, drifting out late and prevailing in the final strides. ELEVATED FOREVER led the way on the inside, dueled while saving ground around the
turn, continued to battle between horses in the stretch and just missed. HIGHER AUTHORITY chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced
in the two path around the turn and dueled down the lane on the outside to narrowly miss. IT'S FATE raced off the pace on the outside in the early going,
navigated the turn from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and finished evenly. STUNNING BABY dueled for the lead on the outside through
the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn and faded in the lane. SONDE ST BLUES trailed the field on the inside up the
backstretch, raced in the three path around turn, swung wide into the stretch and made no bid. JACKLIGHTING dueled for the lead between horses early,
began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and tired further from there.

Footnotes
BRAMBLE BUSH trailed early, moved up between rivals around the turn, tipped out four wide in upper stretch, and rallied to get up late. TRANSLATE
stalked three wide, was cued three wide into the stretch, led in the final sixteenth, but was caught late. A GIRL NAMED JAC prompted the pace two wide,
bid three path top lane, briefly led passing the eight pole but was outmached and ran on for show. PLATINUM FROLIC led in the two path, was coaxed from
the two path into the stretch, but faded. BOURBONWITHGINGER rated from the three path, was ridden along in the five path coming into the stretch, but
flattened. HEART LIGHT tracked from inside but backed out around the turn. SHYLA GIRL was well back in the five path and never threatened. DUE TO A
TIMING MALFUNCTION THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HIGH FASHION LADY bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced off the pace up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path,
began a bid approaching the quarter pole, gained ground on the outside down the lane and pulled clear in the final furlong. SHERLYN GO GO raced off the
pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began to improve position while racing in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the
stretch, led the way with a furlong to go and could not go with the winner late, chasing that rival home, the best of the rest. LA TACHE brushed with the
horse to her inside at the break, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path approaching the three
eighths pole and was outkicked in the lane. WILMA MANKILLER brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, chased the leader up the
backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path coming around the turn and faded in the stretch. MUNNIS PRETTY raced off the pace between
horses in the early going, came around the turn in the two and three path and made no bid. RECIO'S BAYTOWN trailed the field up the backstretch, raced
in the two and three path around the turn, never fired in the lane and was vanned off after pulling up past the wire. PASSINGTHEMISTERY bumped with the
horse to her outside at the break, recovered to open up an early lead up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn
and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
SOL HOPE stalked from the three path, ranged up to bid bid two wide at the top of the lane, and kicked clear. PERFORMANCEANXIETY rated inside, was
driven along while saving ground around the turn, and ran on up the rail to place. KINGDOM'S SPIRIT pressed inside, tipped into the three path at the top of
the lane, and stayed on to show. KIMSFAVORITESTORM chased three wide, was coaxed from the five path into the stretch, but finished evenly. JACK'S
LILLY tracked from the three path, was driven from the four path into the stretch, but flattened. LLUVIA set the pace two wide, was ridden from the two path
at the top of the lane, but faded into the stretch. CRISPY GAL broke out, was well back in the five path and was never a factor. LADY FLINTSHIRE was
slow into stride, trailed early from inside and never threatened. FIVE K KITTEN raced midpack between foes, steadied into the turn, but was empty.

Footnotes
MRS SHAW bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a
five wide bid entering the stretch, gained ground on the outside and drew off in the final furlong, much the best. MICHEAUX stalked the leader on the
outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the far turn from the two path, could not go with the winner late and chased that rival home, the
best of the rest. AT THE GATE bumped with the horse to her outside at the break, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came
around the turn in the two path and gained ground late between horses. SPEAK YOUR MIND tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, raced in
the two path around the turn and finished evenly. MISSIONARY WORK raced in the middle of the pack between horses in the early going, navigated the
turn from the three and four path and was outkicked while drifting out in the final furlong. TRULY A DREAM raced off the pace up the backstretch, came
around the turn in the three path and passed tiring horses in the lane. BLUE BONNIE dueled on the inside in the opening stages, led the way while saving
ground around the turn and faded on the rail in the final furlong. HOLLYWOOD HONEY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the two path and was empty from there. CODAS HONOR brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, trailed the field
through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the turn and offered no bid. SISTER HOLLIE raced at the back of the pack on the inside early,
saved ground around the turn and was never a factor. SCOOCH dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back to chase the
frontrunner while saving ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.
