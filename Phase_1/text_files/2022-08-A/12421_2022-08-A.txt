Footnotes
NIGHT COMMAND was off slowly, then settled into stride in the back on the inside, shifted out a path on the turn and advanced two to three wide, then was
pointed to the inside leaving the turn and closed full of run down on the rail to edge away late under right handed crop urging. QUEEN LUCKY was allowed
to settle early and was three to four wide on the backstretch, followed LADY OUTOFTHE BLUE move on the turn, tipped out four wide in the drive and
rallied well but was outfinished by the winner. LADY OUTOFTHE BLUE was well rated early and made a three wide move on the turn to take over nearing
the quarter pole, then was still clear by the furlong marker but was caught by the sixteenth marker and stayed on to best the rest. NATURE TRAIL set the
pace on the inside and weakened. SULTRY SKY broke in the air at the start, then was three wide on the backstretch and was not a threat. MYRA
FLEENER chased the pace three wide and weakened. HEAVENLY HEART chased the pace on the inside and weakened. WIN FOR LAILA stalked the
pace three to two wide and stopped.

RYE SENSE OF HUMOR was reigned in early on the inside, made a bid leaving the turn on the inside and hit the front nearing the furlong marker, then held
off LEFT BLANK who snuck through on the inside to prove best in a game score. LEFT BLANK was allowed to settle and saved ground throughout, slipped
through on the inside of the winner leaving the three sixteenths and battled to the wire to just miss. SACHMO was bumped at the start, settled early, made a
four wide move on the turn and continued that bid in the drive but hung late, held show award. SOROLLA was settled back early, swung wide leaving the
turn and had a late rally on the outside. STILL THE ONE set the pace while in the two path and faded in the final furlong. AUCHINCRUIVE stalked the early
pace three wide, then dropped in and was between rivals on the backstretch and on the turn, then was in traffic in the drive and had no kick. OCEAN DEEP
lacked a rally. MR DUBAI stalked the pace three wide and weakened. SUPER REIGN chased the pace three wide and tired.

SUPER DUDE was allowed to settle early, angled out leaving the three sixteenths and closed fast late to get up in time under a drive. CONTRAFLOW was
well placed early, then made a bid between rivals on the turn to take a short lead by the quarter pole, then was clear by the furlong marker but was denied
on the last jump to just miss. HOT N SPICY LOVE prompted the pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole but faded the final furlong. GRAB THE
GOLD set the pace on the inside and faded the final furlong. TERRY'S CHARM lacked a rally. A T M AWESOME chased the pace four wide and stopped.

Footnotes
COLONEL MOORHEAD set the pace while racing off the rail, was well handled and drew out leaving the turn and through the stretch to prove best under
mild urging. CHARGING LION was well placed early on the inside, then shifted out to be three wide on the backstretch, made a bid on the turn but flattened
out, held place award. RUNNINGFORHOME was settled early and was five wide on the backstretch, angled in by the half mile marker and was on the
inside on the turn, finished willingly to be gaining for the place award but could not get there and bested rest. FACTOR THIS IN stalked the early pace three
wide, then chased the pace four wide on the backstretch, came five wide into the drive and was empty. CORT'N ASONG stumbled at the start causing the
rider to fall off, walked off. Due to photo finish malfunction the finishing margins were calculated by the writer of these notes.

Footnotes
JET FORCE was away alertly to set the pace while clear and getting over to the inside, then maintained a safe margin to the wire under mild urging to prove
best. DWELLER was allowed to settle on the inside, angled out in the drive and finished well to be second best. RAECHEL'S RISK chased the early pace
and was on the inside on the turn, tipped out three wide leaving the turn but had no kick in the drive. BET THE QUEEN passed the tiring rivals. VINO TINTO
was off a step slow, then was hustled along four to three wide and then was empty in the drive. LUSCIOUS LOLA failed to menace.
