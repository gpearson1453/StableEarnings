Footnotes
MAGNA MASSA was encouraged to a clear lead after the break, let out leaving the turn, received mild urging midstretch and was clearly much the best.
TIZWOW chased from inside, took over second on the bend then gradually pulled away for the place under steady urging in the lane. FRANKEL BABY
raced widest throughout, passed tired ones the last furlong and caught RED BIRD for third. RED BIRD was an early contender but began to fade two wide
leaving the bend. JIM'S RIVER RUNNER chased behind RED BIRD through the turn and had no stretch bid. CRUISING ALTITUDE shied inward at the
start, was straightened then failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
MORNING LINE NEWS rated from outside, angled in some on the turn, was under steady urging in the lane, edged ahead with a sixteenth left and was
drawing clear in the waning yards. WHITE CASHEL broke outward, was corrected, soon advanced inside to vie for the lead, moved ahead when urged with
a quarter mile to go but gradually wore down the last eighth. SWEET FRAULEIN contested the pace between rivals, retreated three wide with three furlongs
left, angled to the outside soon after and could only pull away for third inside the final furlong. RULER DAENERYS displayed early speed between horses
but began to yield two wide before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
ARCH FLYER broke on top but was settled back, commenced her bid from inside on the bend, angled out with two furlongs to go, rallied from path four in
the lane, gradually angled in as she closed the gap on the leader and took over inside the final sixteenth. APOLLO U ANYWHERE soon had the lead,
moved clear on the turn, widened command under urging in the stretch, did not have enough left in the late going but was unchallenged for second.
COOKIN ROSES made a small leap from the gate, pressed APOLLO U ANYWHERE from outside, floated out some into the stretch and gradually yielded.
QUIET DRAMA hesitated then also made a small leap from the gate, progressed just off or along the rail, fanned out behind ARCH FLYER for the stretch
run, angled in upper stretch and began to flatten with a furlong left. THEYCALLHERPINKY chased from off the inside, swung out to path five for the stretch
run and had no significant response. HALO COUTURE chased from outside, came widest into the lane and had little to offer.

HIDDEN FIGURE shared the lead from between horses, moved ahead two wide on the bend, floated out some entering the lane, lugged in the final
sixteenth under right-handed pressure but held sway. GHAALEB'S MAGIC hustled along to stay close early, altered out some trying to gain a clear path,
jostled repeatedly with MISS LEARJET on the backstretch, moved clear for third three wide on the bend, swung outside HIDDEN FIGURE for the stretch run
and found best stride too late. HIDENSEEK SALLY displayed early speed from inside, did not stay with HIDDEN FIGURE on the turn and slowly yielded
inside the last eighth. DEAUVILLE MIST raced in contention from inside, did not keep up on the bend, came off the rail some for the stretch run and made
up minor ground in the late going. MISS LEARJET jostled repeatedly as she prompted the pace from outside on the backstretch, was four wide taking the
turn and gradually wore down the final furlong.

Footnotes
GIRLOLAMO'GLORY rated toward the outside, advanced four wide on the turn, was bumped at the top of the lane, drifted out midstretch, held a straight
path inside the last furlong, was all out and got up in time. GONEGHOST shared the early lead from inside, moved clear on the bend, floated out some into
the stretch, gradually drifted out and had to settle for second best. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN progressed between rivals on the turn, moved to the rail leaving
the bend, took over third upper stretch then leveled off. PEACOCK MAN moved out between horses midway on the backstretch, progressed three wide on
the turn, floated out some into the lane, bumped GIRLOLAMO'GLORY, began to yield, his rider lost his whip just inside the final eighth then finished evenly.
INDIAN SIGN displayed early speed just outside GONEGHOST but began to fade before finishing a half mile. BABA LOU chased from inside horses, had
the rail on the bend, swung out for the stretch run and had no late bid. DEMAND RANSOM chased from outside and was never a factor.

Footnotes
JOLIE RULER broke in stride, was settled back some, went for the lead two wide on the turn, had the advantage into the lane then drew away while kept to
task to the waning yards. IGGY BIGS forwardly placed just outside JOLIE RULER, was no match for the latter when set down for the drive but took over
second with eighty yards to go. GHAALEB'S DOMAIN gained the lead from inside after travelling the first sixteenth, was challenged on the turn, also no
match for JOLIE RULER in the stretch and began to wear down inside the last eighth. PRANCIPANTS came into contention from outside on the bend but
flattened out for the drive. GO MADI GO was an early factor just off the inside but began to fade on the turn. WILDCAT BOBBIE was a factor from inside on
the backstretch but yielded leaving the bend.

Footnotes
CAMPAIGN SPY gradually progressed from outside to vie for the lead on the second bend, was roused leaving that turn, moved clear and maintained
control under steady handling. ANTRIM'S GIANT was settled early, came into contention between horses three wide on the second turn, fanned out further
for the stretch run, rallied belatedly but caught AMERICAN SUCCESS for second nearing the wire. AMERICAN SUCCESS chased from inside, found
himself boxed in on the second bend, got through two wide leaving that turn, moved to the rail upper stretch, took over second inside the last furlong, lacked
the extra needed in the late going and was outfinished. LEMON BLITZ was bumped solidly shortly after the start and forced into DANG IT CASSIE, settled
off the inside, came into contention four wide on the second turn, swung outside ANTRIM'S GIANT into the stretch and flattened out. SHOBIZ STAR broke
on top, was soon clear, showed the way just off the rail, was challenged from outside on the second turn, could not hold back CAMPAIGN SPY into the lane
and gave way between rivals the last eighth. LASTFORTINOFAMILY was soon trailing, though hustled vigorously from the gate, angled out through the
second bend and passed a couple tired rivals upper stretch. MAXIMILIANO broke a bit outward, was angled back in, bumped solidly with LEMON BLITZ,
quickly recovered to race in the second flight outside DANG IT CASSIE but gave way from between horses after five furlongs. DANG IT CASSIE was
bumped from the rear shortly after the break, advanced to help prompt the pace just off or along the rail, gave way from inside nearing the quarter pole, was
unresponsive to urging in the lane and in hand late. The race was made official with No. 3, AMERICAN SUCCESS, incorrectly placed second and No. 2,
ANTRIM'S GIANT placed third. The tote system was corrected and any remaining 4-2 Exactas, 4-2-3 Trifectas and 4-2-3-7 Superfectas will be paid out.
