Footnotes
FAITHFUL SON unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out three-wide nearing the eighth pole for room, drifted further out during the
drive and finished fast to be up in the final strides. BRANNIGAN prompted the pace set by Silver King Bain while racing two-wide and just missed in a
prolonged drive. SILVER KING BAIN set the pace racing along the inside, responded when asked and held on determinedly to the wire to lose a close
decision. CAUSE I'M COOL was prominent from the start while racing four-wide but lacked a late response. LOVE THAT KID was never far back, moved up
five-wide to reach contention before going three furlongs but was unable to sustain his bid during the drive. LIE AND DENY was forwardly placed between
horses while racing three-wide for three furlongs and gave way.

CANDY ZIP was reserved off the early pace, rallied three-wide the final quarter and finished fast to just miss. CODY'S CHOICE hopped in the air at the start
to get away behind the field, moved up along the outside to take the lead before going a quarter mile, disputed the issue to the eighth pole and weakened
slightly. BIG ENDEAVOR saved ground while being permitted to settle in stride, but lacked a rally when asked. THE STEWARD CONDUCTED A REVIEW
OF THE RUNNING OF THE RACE, BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH,
