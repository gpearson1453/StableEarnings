Footnotes
R T'S WILDCAT worked way clear after breaking forwardly along the inside, taken in hand through the turn while maintaining daylight, drew off through the
lane while only being shown the crop to win ridden out. CATINANDSCATIN in the second along the inside, continued to chase into the lane, proved no
match in the run to the wire, edged clear for the runner up position. ZOEY'S HIPPIE also in the second group while in the three path, also had little for the
winner in the drive, outkicked late for the place. TEXAS TURBINE raced back off the pace while well out in the strip, continued in the four path through the
turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick. EXOTIC GENTLEMAN off a step slow, remained always back. FLASH OF RAIN fell back, trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
ARCHIE broke well from the outside, narrowly set the pace just off the inside through the first turn, dueled into and through the far turn closest to the rail,
headed into the lane, regained the advantage a furlong out, and continued to battle to the wire to prevail in game fashion. WISE GUY prompted the issue
early three wide, continued to press the winner up the backstretch, dueled through the final turn, put a head in front with three sixteenths remaining,
outgamed to the wire, held sway for the place. GUITAR SLIM pressed the issue early inside, fell back off the top two after a quarter, continued to pursue
that duo through the final turn inside, no late gain, well clear of the others. FRANK THE MAYOR settled off the pace, split foes turning for home, went evenly
to the wire in lacking a closing bid. CITADEL in mid pack outside, three wide into the lane, also lacked a closing response. ZENUCCI a bit rank along the
inside through the first turn, remained back to be always outrun. SOCIAL AFLEET void of speed, four wide exiting the final turn, also failed to muster a rally.

PRADO'S PRIORITY cleared to the inside after breaking in good order, was given a breather through the turn, comfortably clear through the lane under a
hand ride to win ridden out. MAGAWILDTIME back off the pace toward the inside, steered out when straightened for home, along for the runner up spot
while not a threat to the winner. G'WILDCAT chased the winner into the turn to that one's outside, crept a bit closer by late in the turn, flattened out to prove
no match in the drive, caught late for the place. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU fell back to trail after the start, was never a threat.

Footnotes
KASEN'S SISTER broke alertly, narrowly showed the way out of the chute, dueled into the far turn, headed midway on the bend, stayed on along the rail
into the lane, regained the advantage just inside the furlong marker while remaining inside, drew clear under steady handling. SHE'S MY PRIORITY
pressed the winner early from the outside, dueled the middle part, showed the way into the lane, could not keep pace with the winner late to be outkicked by
that one, clearlty second best. TAKENFORGRANTED last away, continued to trail in the run up the backstretch off the inside, came four wide for the drive,
remained widest through the stretch, determined for the show while not a serious threat to the top pair. ALLSTAR MAGIC closest to the dueling top two
along the inside, could do little with that pair through the lane, outfinished late for the show. APHRODITES REVENGE in the second flight off the inside,
between foes into and through the stretch, not enough for the show while still between horses. SWIMHARD DREAMBIG finished early, trailed most of the
way.

Footnotes
CHARLIE SKY cleared from the outside into the turn, continued to show the way into the stretch in the two path, expanded that advantage past the furlong
marker then held the runner up safe late under steady handling. FLYING I forwardly placed early toward the inside, chased into the lane, drifted out then in
with a furlong remaining and less, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late. RETRO RITA last to leave after being shuffled back, in some traffic early
turn, swung three to four wide into the stretch, brushed with SEEMYVALENTINE inside the furlong grounds, outfinished that one to be up narrowly for the
show. SEEMYVALENTINE in mid pack off the inside, roused for the drive, brushed with less than a furlong remaining, missed the show. BELINDA lacked
early foot, moved closer late in the turn, chased the top two past the furlong marker, caught for that position late after flattening out. VISIONLADY away in
good order, fell back outside, four wide into the turn, was never dangerous through the stretch in picking off a tiring rival. COSMIC BELLE chased the winner
for three furlongs then gave way in the drive. POSEIDON'S QUEEN in mid pack early, fell back in the turn, stopped through the stretch and jogged in far
back.

Footnotes
PROUDTOWN close up early inside, fell back a bit before a half and moved outside, collared the leader nearing the furlong marker, got clear, came out late
under a left handed crop, enough left late to hold off the runner up. R T'S IRON MAN last away, lacked early foot, moved a bit closer before a half, three
wide far turn, came four wide for the drive, closed the gap on the winner, floated out by that one late, willingly. K V TARGET away in good order from the
outside, narrowly showed the way first turn, got clear before a half, remained clear final turn, offered little resistance to the winner when confronted by that
one a furlong out, weakened, no match for the runner up, saved the show. BIG TIME BANDIT in the second flight while off the inside, three wide far turn,
closest to the top two with a furlong to run then lacked a closing punch to lose the shgow. PLAY MASTER went one paced while out in the strip to also lack
a closing response. ANGOLA VACATION void of speed out in the strip, five wide into the far turn,dropped to the rail by late in the final turn, failed to rally as
well. FOREVER PEACE fractious in the gate prior to the start, broke with the field, slow to settle after racing in traffic into the first turn, stopped after a half,
far back, jogged in.

GOTTA GO prompted the issue early outside the leader, continued to appy pressure up the backstretch, moved up to duel second turn, got out into the lane
when gaining a slight advangtage, put that foe away approaching the furlong marker, responded when the winner challenged from along the inside soon
after, dug on late to prevail in game fashion. DREWPOWER broke out and steadied slightyly to be off slowly and to spot the remaining field a couple of
lengths, unhurried, closer before a half, advanced and challenged inside the winner inside the furlong grounds, outkicked to the wire. TURN ON THE
MAGIC balked a bit at loading, broke with the two leaders, stalked that pair three wide up the backstretch, called on for run turning for home, proved no
match for that same pair, came back for the third spot. PEPPER JACK broke on top, showed the way through the first turn and onto the backstretch inside,
dueled with the winner final turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
STORM BREACH last to leave, lacked speed, began to advance far turn, three wide into the lane, shifted out widest when approaching the furlong marker,
closed with good resolve to be up in time. JUST A WIN away in good order from the outside, stalked the two leaders up the backstretch and into the turn,
put a head in front entering the stretch, clear past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, remained clear for the second spot. ELIZABETH RENEE
in mid pack for a half, four wide into the lane, chased the runner up past the furlong marker, lacked a closing punch to finish up best of the rest. T R'S FIRST
in the main group while three wide up the backstretch, dropped to the inside through the turn, went evenly through the stretch while in the two path. MY
AVANI broke sharp from along the inside, dueled out of the chute, continued to alternate up the backstretch and into the turn, began to weaken midway on
the bend then gave ground steadily through the stretch. AUNT JANA broke back, moved out well into the strip, raced five wide out of the turn, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals while not a factor. SLIDE lacked speed while three wide, failed to respond through the lane. TRICKY MOM dueled up front in the two
path, briefly clear early in the turn then stopped when headed by the runner up soon after.
