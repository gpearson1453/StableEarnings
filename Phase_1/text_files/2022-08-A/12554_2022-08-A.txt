Footnotes
TWELFTH MOON showed good speed outside to lead, was headed at the top of the stretch and responded well when asked with a furlong out to hold off
inside and outside challenges, pulled up after the finish galloping out and was vanned off. LOADED QUESTION stalked mid pack between runners in the
first quarter, began circling horses going four wide on the turn, loomed up for the lead with three sixteenths to go and could not offer enough late to get up at
the wire. IMA BEAST tracked just off the pace inside, waited behind runners through the turn and ran determinedly on the fence down the lane to be a solid
third. DANCE RHYTHMS was situated between runners mid pack for the first half, roused with a quarter to go to challenge the leaders and had no finish to
offer in the last eighth. ASTROLOGICAL was squeezed between rivals soon after the break, settled near the rear afterwards, roused on the turn, angled out
six wide for the stretch run and ran evenly through the lane. MRS. DEL pressed the winner in the early stages, contended for the lead turning for home
between rivals and weakened with a furlong to go losing position late. MARAIS was squeezed between runners shortly after break to trail, entering the turn
was in tight checking mildly and failed to fire in the stretch.

Footnotes
SILENT FORTUNE raced mid-pack between runners early then outside four to five wide on the turn, took aim and struck the lead seventy yards from home
driving past. HALF TO RELOAD was encouraged forward to be among the early leaders then chased inside on or just off the rail through the turn, came out
a bit in mid-stretch but lacked room then went back to the rail to bid late but was outkicked. ONE BAY HEMINGWAY veered out at the break then was
encouraged forward while receiving right-handed encouragement to counter getting out early, took the lead after the opening quarter mile, angled in entering
the turn going about two wide, came in a bit in upper stretch then back off the rail, was overtaken in late stretch and outkicked. RAGING BEAR was
forwardly-positioned racing two to three wide into the turn, was within striking distance when put in slightly tight quarters in mid-stretch and was outkicked.
GIVE ME MY MONEY got away slowly and steadied slightly at the start spotting the field a few lengths, moved near the inside and saved some ground on
the turn before swinging out six wide, ran on with mild late interest. MIA'S LIL ANGEL lacked early speed despite encouragement, saved ground on the turn,
ran evenly. SOUPER SUNSHINE settled toward the rear, swung seven wide for the drive and passed tired rivals. POSTURING chased from outside early,
shifted in three wide into the turn, steadily dropped back. SECRET STORM chased two to three wide, came up empty.

SILENT RUNNER tracked the dueling leaders down the backside, commenced a rally mid turn outside to contend for the lead at the top of the stretch, took
over with an eighth to go and was kept to the task to win going away at the wire. LIGHT THE LAMP broke sharp to lead, was pressed by an inside rival for
the first quarter, repelled that challenge through the turn only to quickly be headed by the winner turning for home, fought on briefly but could not match
strides with the winner in the late stages of the race settling for second money. BOSSY HOLIDAY stalked near the back on the rail early on, was roused
through the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch in the four path to close mildly down the lane getting up for third. UNCLE JOE pressed the lead on the
rail in the backstretch, began to weaken inside midway on the turn and levelled out in the stretch for a minor share. SOUPER RUSH shortly after the break
was in tight quarters between runners, appeared to have clipped heels, stumbled and could not recover to contend afterwards. STEWARDS INQUIRY

Footnotes
GRANDSON settled off the pace outside, entered the turn about four wide, swung out seven wide for the drive, took aim and under steady urging got up
late. CRUDEN BAY tucked in behind the leading trio racing outside a rival, went mostly two to three wide on the turn, came out five or six wide turning for
home, lugged in a bit near the eighth pole clear of the inside foe, kept on inside and just off the winner to get the place. MAAKWA moved forward to take
charge dictating terms, set the pace on or just off the rail, came out in late stretch and was outfinished. FUNICULI settled toward the rear shifting in,
advanced past rivals to improve position inside. PERFECT CRIME pursued the pace two to three wide, was urged along by the quarter pole, came out a bit
in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. BANFF tucked in behind the leading trio racing near the rail into and on the turn, came out four wide turning for
home and was in just a bit tight, then brushed with a rival and steadied ever so slightly near the eighth pole, ran on. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) bumped with a
rival at the start, raced toward the back, went two wide on the turn, failed to rally. OCELOT broke out and bumped a rival at the start, pursued the pace from
outside three to four wide, was carried out just a bit in mid-stretch, brushed lightly with a rival, came up empty. I'M DASHING was bumped and squeezed at
the break and subsequently outpaced. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
DISSECTOLOGIST was in a good tracking position early behind three contesting frontrunners, waited through to turn, angled just outside to engage the
leaders turning for home and wore down his rivals close to the finish for the win. WAR SAFE pressed the pace outside after the start, dueled three wide for
the lead on the turn with two other runners, briefly held the lead in deep stretch only to be caught nearing the wire. JACK was situated near the back in the
beginning, advanced between runners through the turn, angled outside in the five path closing well through the stretch and just missed getting up for the
place award. CAPE COD battled early on between runners contesting the pace, fought on gamely inside at the top of the stretch for the lead and then began
to weaken late with a sixteenth to go. HERE BE DRAGONS broke inwards to begin, tracked on the rail mid pack through the backside, was ridden with a
quarter to go inside and kept grinding down the stretch between horses to finish on the fringes. UPTOWN LIGHTS settled outside near the back after the
start, was asked on the turn with little response and could not get involved the final quarter. BEAU GUEST battled on the rail for the lead to begin, fought on
with two other rivals with a half to go, was ridden to keep up mid turn and retreated on the fence through the stretch. STEP FORWARD trailed early leaving
the chute, could not get interesting down the backstretch and was not a factor down the lane.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE KNIGHT settled off the pace in the back half of the field, raced outside three then four wide on the turn beginning to advance, struck the lead in
upper stretch, drew clear and held sway while being kept to the task. TOUR OF DUTY angled in early tracking mid-pack along the inside, came out a path
late on the turn then angled out further in upper stretch for room, ran on to be second best while making no headway on the winner. FAST FEET settled
inside off the pace, moved out running mostly two to three wide through most of the turn, angled six wide passing the five-sixteenths, was a contender for
second but evened out late. ENCHANT ME bumped with a rival after the start, raced well back going between runners two to three wide on the turn, swung
out five wide turning for home then tipped out in mid-stretch for more room and ran on well but too late. LORD OF WAR raced just off the leaders moving in
two to three deep into the turn, lost ground on the top pair through that bend, kept on one-paced and failed to rally. CUPID'S DUDE broke a half step slowly
and in tight quarters, shifted in, saved ground near the rail on the turn, came out in upper stretch, ran on. OCTOBER FROST bumped with a foe and
steadied soon after the break, raced outside rivals at the rear three to four wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch, failed to rally. JUSTIN'S WAY
pursued the pacesetter from outside two to three wide, faded in the lane. DANFUSI bobbled inwardly at the start then was rushed forward to set the pace,
moved clear on the turn, faltered and faded. TAPTHESPEEDOFSOUND tracked in behind inside on or just off the rail, came up empty.

Footnotes
BREATHING FIRE was brushed at the break, rated mid pack on the rail through the backside, quickly advanced on the rail with two furlongs to go, split
runners at the three sixteenths pole to take the lead nearing the furlong marker and won drawing away late. PLEASURE'S GOLD tracked on the rail behind
the pace, waited inside through the turn, angled just outside of runners for the stretch drive and ran on well in the final eighth to get up for second. FOREST
B pressed the lead on the rail into the turn, assumed command with a quarter to run while inside, opened up briefly at the three sixteenth pole, was headed
with a furlong to go and faded late just losing the place photo at the wire. AMERICAN GAMBLE advanced around runners going four wide through the turn,
was floated out to the seven path when rallying at the top of the stretch and ran evenly to the finish line for a minor share. DIXIE MORNING broke in at the
start, rated at the back early, angled just outside of horses through the turn and passed tiring runners down the stretch. INDIAN MUSIC broke sharp to lead,
was collared with a quarter mile to run, weakened while drifting outwards at the top of the stretch and faded with an eighth to go. LOIS LEN trailed down the
backside, saved ground through the turn and could never get into contention. INSPECTOR RELOAD was roused to keep up with the field through the turn
and could not offer a finish. ALLPAIDUP chased the leaders early, was three wide contending on the turn, fanned six wide at the top of the stretch and
stopped through the lane.

LONG POND tracked in behind two to three wide, moved between rivals past the five-sixteenths, took aim on the leader and the lead by the furlong marker
then was eased up late. THE GREAT OZ switched outside the pacesetter, went three wide pursuing that one through the turn taking the lead past the
five-sixteenths, was no match for the winner but second best. CLASSY WHISPER was in tight behind rivals about two wide entering the turn, steadied
coming to the three-eighths pole, angled out six wide leaving the turn, drifted in late but ran on well. POINT TO THE STARS raced well back early, was wide
on the turn fanning seven deep into the stretch, drifted in through upper stretch and under all out pressure kept on. UNCLE SPIDER tracked inside, was in
tight on heels at various points through the turn, came out wide at the top of the stretch, lost the crop about the three-sixteenths, kept on evenly. POSEIDON
STEEL broke awkwardly, raced near the inside, came out at the eighth pole, ran on. LOBBY BAR moved clear willingly early, set the pace off the rail,
moved nearer the rail on the turn, weakened in the stretch. NEWPORT AGENT advanced outside rivals four wide early, was in tight at the three-sixteenths,
weakened. BLUE MAX was forwardly-placed into the turn three wide and between runners, came up empty.

HAVE A SOUPER DAY stalked mid pack between rivals, picked up runners on the rail through the turn, angled just outside splitting horses mid stretch and
was full of run late getting up just before the wire. GHOSTLINER pressed for the lead from the onset, dueled with that inside rival in upper stretch, put that
challenger away with a furlong to go but could not hold off the late charge from the closing winner nearing the finish. CHECKERBOARD FLOOR showed
good speed to be in front at the start, battled through the turn with an outside runner for the lead, continued to duel through the stretch giving away
grudgingly inside late holding on to be a clear third. GHOUL (BRZ) settled near the back in the beginning, advanced outside of rivals on the turn, offered a
mild rally at the top of the stretch and stalled in the final eighth to garner a minor placing. CONCEALED CARRY was steadied briefly down the backside,
settled near the rear afterwards, rallied three wide outside runners on the turn, angled out to the seven path for the finish and closed with some late energy
the last eighth. CIRCLE OF FRIENDS trailed in the early stages, asked through the turn inside saving ground but could not offer a run. AIM FOR THE SKY
broke in at the start, was steadied repeatedly inside of runners down the backstretch, was shuffled back to last through the turn and could not be a presence
for the run through the lane. MALIBU SECRET rated behind the pace inside, roused with a quarter to go and had little to offer for the stretch drive.
HAPPYMAC tracked outside just off the pace early, loomed three wide contending for the lead at the top of the stretch and backed away through the field
between runners down the lane.

Footnotes
DIXIE BOUND rated back off the leaders early, went three to four wide into the turn, swung seven wide turning for home, drifted in a bit in upper stretch,
struck the lead in and cleared. BELENTIME eased back and allowed to settle early, went about three wide on the turn, came into upper stretch five wide,
moved out near mid-stretch for room, rallied to gain second. PINK GELATO was in tight after the break, raced at the rear, moved out seven wide leaving the
turn, gained in the stretch but was outfinished for second. KILLARY settled at the rear inside, altered out in upper stretch for room, ran on with late interest.
STOLEN MONEY was outside foes mid-pack four wide through the turn, came into upper stretch about six deep, came out a bit then lugged in a bit in upper
stretch, kept on late. BARTICA raced between rivals about three wide mid-pack into the turn coming five wide into upper stretch, was forced in by a drifting
rival near the three-sixteenths, ran on inside. NEPOMUCENO got away alertly, shifted in dictating terms in the clear, continued in the two path on the turn,
faded in the stretch. TREBUCHET chased outside just off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, came up empty. SETTEBELLO raced inside rivals
mid-pack, came out a path in upper stretch, failed to rally. THREE MILE LIMIT was forwardly-placed tracking inside, failed to rally and faded in the stretch.
KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) chased the pace from between runners two to three wide, came up empty.
