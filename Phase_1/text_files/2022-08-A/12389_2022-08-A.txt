Footnotes
LA LIMONADA was allowed to settle early, saved ground to the quarter pole, shifted out leaving the turn, then found room to make a bid and split rivals by
the furlong marker and finished full of run to draw clear under a mild drive. IN A SPIN was rated early while three wide on the first turn, then made way down
to the inside on the backstretch, eased out on the turn and came five wide into the lane, finished well but could not go with the winner, second best. SWAN
POINT was reserved early while three wide, came seven wide into the lane and had a late rally to gain the show award. WITCH was in tight between horses
into the first turn, pulled way up three wide to stalked the pace and weakened in the drive. A CASE OF YOU chased the pace three wide and lacked the
needed rally. MOON CHANT was rank early, then settled down to set the pace on the inside but weakened the final furlong. NO EASY ANSWER checked
the first time by the wire, then tracked the pace on the inside and tired.

DANCING TIL DUSK was settled three to two wide, started to move out leaving the half mile marker when MY DIXIE LASS shifted from the rail to the three
or four path and tried to keep him in causing that rival to check up, despite correcting at once, then shifted out on the turn and advanced four wide on the
turn to move into contention, continued to close well in the drive to get up after a long drive. BELLA PRIMA set the pace on the inside and shook clear
leaving the turn, dug in gamely but was caught late, held place award. MY DIXIE LASS was reserved on the inside, shifted out leaving the half mile marker
and came to the outside of eventual winner when rival started to make his move, but had to check up, then tucked back inside entering the turn, eased out
and swung wide for the drive and rallied well to finish on even terms for the show award. BECKON was settled early, made a four wide middle move on the
backstretch, then stalked the pacesetter three wide on the turn and finished willingly but was out kicked. IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN tracked the early pace
and then was shuffled back and had no rally. SPIRIT OR SPITE pressed the pace two wide and weakened. VOLADOR made a five wide middle move and
flattened out. LIKEUONLYPRETTIER chased the pace on the inside and weakened. THE JOCKEY ON MY DIXIE LASS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE
WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE HALF MILE MARKER, AFTER WATCHING THE REPLAYS THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED THE
WINNER AND PLACED THAT RUNNER FOURTH.

ZILLION was well rated early on three wide, made a four wide move on the turn and took over and drew clear, then drew out leaving the turn and proved
much the best under mild urging. SOUL STORY was fractious in the gate, reserved inside early, split rivals on the turn and was four wide by the quarter pole
while following the winners move, but could not get to that rival while being clearly second best. CHAIN REACTION broke outwardly and was four wide into
the first turn, then worked way to the inside on the far turn, then was behind the weakening pacesetters, shifted off the inside in the lane and was along for
the show award. LTL BEAR SALOON vied for the lead on the inside and weakened. STREET LAMP chased the pace and was four to five wide on the
backstretch and weakened. TURNS vied for the lead between rivals and weakened. MAGNETIC CHARM was forced out at the start, then was five wide into
the first turn, not a threat. SECRET SOULMATE vied for the lead three wide and tired.

Footnotes
DREAMERS REWARD was well placed early on the inside, eased out and made a two wide bid on the turn to duel for command, then took over nearing the
quarter pole and drew off in the stretch to prove much the best under a drive. WINNERS WIN was allowed to settle and saved ground on the turn, angled
out in the drive and was up for the place award between horses. CREATIVE MAGIC tracked the pace three wide and weakened, got nod for the show
award. GREY QUEST set the pace on the inside early, then dueled for the lead on the turn and weakened. NIGHTENFORD KAZ was outrun early, then
saved ground on the turn and lacked a solid rally. PEAKY BLINKERS was allowed to settle and was three wide on the turn and was empty. HAPPY GUY
was outrun early, raced wide on the turn and was not a factor.
