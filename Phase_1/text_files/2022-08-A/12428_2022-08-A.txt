Footnotes
KENTUCKY PEERLESS raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the turn in the two path, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole and got up for the win late while drifting mildly in the stretch. CHARLIE COMANCH dueled on the outside up the backstretch,
raced in the two and three path around the turn, dug in down the lane while drifting out some and just missed. GLENDORA MINECAT raced in the middle of
the pack on the inside through the early going, came around the turn in the two path and gained ground late on the outside in the lane. HOTFOOT hopped
up leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and flattened out in the
final furlong. CEBOLLA bumped with the horse to the outside leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and
made no bid. PROVOST led the way between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and faded
in the lane. ARIMONY brushed with the horse to her inside at the break, recovered to press the pace on the rail up the backstretch, saved ground around
the turn and weakened from there. A JOCKEYS OBJECTION WAS PLACED BY THE RIDER OF HORSE FIVE, ARIMONY, CITING INTERFERENCE
FROM HORSE FOUR, CEBOLLA, AT THE START. UPON REVIEW, THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGES TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

the three path coming around the turn, dueled down the lane and was caught late. OUR IRIS ROSE chased the pacesetter on the inside through the

sixteenth. GEMSTONE GAL raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, gained ground mildly
in upper stretch and finished evenly. MISS YOU MOM dropped back to trail well behind the field up the backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch
