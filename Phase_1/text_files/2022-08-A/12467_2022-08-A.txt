Footnotes
SKYLAR'S SISTER rated off the pace and between rivals, edged up a bit then shifted in soon into the lane, was blocked behind foes leaving the three
sixteenths, swung out widest inside the furlong grounds, closed determinedly under right handed asking and forged past UP FOR IT in the final strides. UP
FOR IT , off a bit slow, rated three wide and between foes early on, angled out five wide for clear sailing into the lane, closed in under pressure and took
command a sixteenth out, spurted clear, kept on gamely but failed to contain the winner's charge. QUEEN'S GARDEN settled in mid pack while saving
ground, got through towards the rail to advance past the sixteenth pole, kept on with good energy and just earned the show. ANOTHERDAYGONEBY , four
deep early, circled four wide advancing into the lane, gave hard chase from there and churned on to close the gap. NEVER FREE chased the leader while
two wide, edged closer nearing the lane but failed to bring a solid kick in the final furlong. LADY SERENITY opened up early, set the pace towards the rail,
remained well clear while under pressure leaving the eighth pole, saw her advantage disappear near the sixteenth pole, drifted out some then faltered.
ROARINGLIKETHUNDER chased outside a rival, was caught between foes into the lane then gave way.

around the turn and was kept to her business in the drive. SCAMPER ALONG lightly bumped with the winner leaving the starting gate, was four deep
entering the stretch and rallied. DIAL EMMA REILLY , bumped by SPECIAL FREEDOM soon after the break, trailed to the stretch, worked between horses
and passed tired ones. SPECIAL FREEDOM drifted in leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail, offered a mild move in mid stretch and flattened out.

SOME IS NINE , a forward factor outside the winner early, chased her to the stretch and gave way. SO GRACIOUS was outrun. HICKTOWN showed early
speed along the inner rail, rated back approaching the half mile pole, eased outside near the three eighths pole, faltered after a half mile and was eased

Footnotes
SAIGON eased out nearing backstretch and was well handled within range of a contested pace, moved through an inviting seam between rivals heading
towards the far turn, stuck a head in front soon after then was nicely rated past the five sixteenths, opened up after given her cue past the quarter pole, was
kept alert with one right handed ask near the furlong grounds then cruised home under a mild hand ride. SEE OUT , patiently handled off the inside while
not far back, dropped in towards the rail leaving the far turn, got through to make progress entering the stretch, altered out of a tight spot leaving mid stretch
and finished up with good energy to gain the place in the final yards. IMAGINE IT ALL , rank at the break, quickly regrouped and moved clear early while
securing the inside, was joined from a rival to his outside and alternated for the lead through the backstretch run, ceded command leaving the far turn,
stayed on to give willing pursuit into the lane then gave way grudgingly through the final yards. VICTORY ANTHEM settled off the pace, gained off the rail
into the far turn, circled four wide into the stretch but failed to seriously sustain. PHOTO COPY disputed the pace three wide outside IMAGINE IT ALL, held
the lead past the five eighths and edged away slightly before being rejoined by a pair to his inside near the half, chased three wide into the lane then faded.
WEBB was rated back leaving the gate and taken wide, dropped in some for the drive but failed to menace. SWALLOW BEACH saved ground and failed to
menace. THUNDERHOUSE saved ground and chased early on, was taken four wide and gave way. SO SWELL was outrun.

intermittent urging and switched to her left lead late. ILLUSION OF HOPE , well placed early, circled foes three deep around the turn and rallied. KOBE'S
GIRL , a forward factor in the two path on the turn, chased the winner and gave way late. TIPSY TOURIST came in when rank at the break, drifted to the
five path turning for home and finished evenly. MEJORAMIGA , unhurried outside horses down the back stretch, raced three to four wide on the turn, drifted
to the seven path in upper stretch and failed to threaten. ALITTLESLICEOF PIE hugged the inner rail chasing the winner to the stretch, gave way in upper
stretch. GLIDE , pinched back leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail around the turn and was not a factor. CAPTURE THE FIRE was outrun.

Footnotes
TAUBER was angled in early and taken to rate, steadied briefly when appearing to want to get out into the turn, regrouped and eased out to advance past
the three eighths, worked his way between runners leaving three sixteenths then emerged in the clear as the closest pursuer of the leader, kept on grinding
under left handed asking, forged ahead in deep stretch then prevailed. MONSTER MASON was taken to rate in the opening furlong and dropped in, edged
up when angling off the inside into the stretch, moved up about four to five wide near the three sixteenths, was forced to alter out further soon after,
straightened away, came with a game run and was gaining between rivals. SUE LOVES BARBADOS , well back while saving ground, swung very wide for
the drive, straightened away and finished well to close the gap. PICKIN SEA GLASS accelerated to the inside of HEIR PORT in the opening eighth, took
command and cleared off, set a rated pace two wide into the lane, remained clear while being set down near mid stretch, ceded to the winner inside the
sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. PRINCE PERE , three to four wide early, shifted out and gained past the three sixteenths but failed to sustain in
the final furlong. ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN , floated out some by the winner nearing the turn, regrouped and rated off the rail mid turn, shifted out wider for the
drive, altered out late but could only manage a mild gain. HEIR PORT , urged to a brief early lead, rated off of PICKIN SEA GLASS after a furlong, stalked
under a light hold then moved up into the lane, had aim heading to mid stretch, failed to kick on and faded. WAR AND ROSES , well placed inside, failed to
go on nearing the three sixteenths and weakened. FOLE'S NOTION broke a step slow, was lightly steadied soon after then was outrun.

Footnotes
MAXIMUM IMPACT , patiently rated inside horses down the backstretch, waited for room mid way on the far turn, moved up along the rail entering the
stretch, remained along the rail in the drive, responded to brisk urging and took the lead inside PHARAOH'S TRIUMPH approaching the finish. PHARAOH'S
TRIUMPH sprinted to the early lead, opened up on the backstretch, was in the two path through the stretch and gave way grudgingly. AWESOME MAN ,
sluggish early, was lightly steadied lacking room near the three eighths pole, drifted out in mid stretch and offered a slight rally. BAD TO THE BONES
stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced three wide to take aim on the leader entering the stretch then gave way. SHOFAR , well placed inside
horses down the backstretch, moved up in the two path on the far turn, drifted out entering the stretch and gave way. GALATIANS , no factor, circled rivals
on the far turn, was fanned four deep turning for home and gave way.

Footnotes
E. P. MILTON rated close up and in the clear mid turn, shifted out, made a grinding run outside rivals and under left handed pressure, gained a slim lead in
the final jumps and prevailed. GALLANT GEORGE , urged from the gate, took over early and moved clear, set the pace towards the inside, dug in when
confronted from his outside, dueled on a slim lead past mid stretch, dealt with another challenge from the winner inside the sixteenth pole, kept on valiantly
but just missed inside foes. FOMO prompted from the outside, moved alongside the leader in upper stretch, battled on near even terms in mid stretch and
kept on with good effort between rivals in the final yards. NEVER SATISFIED was steadied back from between foes in the opening sixteenth, regrouped and
trailed outside a rival, swung five wide for the drive, moved up in mid stretch then failed to seriously kick on. UNCLE ROAMIE had speed to the inside but
was rated back off the leader, saved ground mid turn, moved up past the eighth pole but needed more in the final yards. KARNAK , three deep early, raced
four wide into the lane but lacked a rally. HEADS OR TAILS saved ground and came up empty. NEVER SILENCED , between rivals mid turn, faded.
