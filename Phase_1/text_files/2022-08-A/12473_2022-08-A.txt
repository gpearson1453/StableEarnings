JUST LIKE TRISTA set a pressured pace through the backstretch and dictated terms by a narrow margin around the far turn, widened advantage in upper
stretch and finished going away. KAYLA stalked the pace near the inside, shifted out for a clear path leaving the final turn, came four wide into the lane, was
no match for pulling away winner but dug in to capture place. BUG A BOO settled through early stages near the inside, given cue along the rail at the head
of the lane, gained closer contention, ran on and got nipped for place. SIMMERING rated off the early pace, picked up the tempo four wide midway around
the far turn, edged closer then fanned six wide into upper stretch and flattened out. PICTURE LADY prompted the pace through the backstretch and
continued apply pressure to JUST LIKE TRISTA around the far turn then tired in the drive. GAME TO PLAY tracked the pace to the far turn, hustled along
five wide into upper stretch and came up empty.

MOTO MOTO dueled for the lead with CHICKS DIG SCARS into the turn, continued to battle for command into the lane, shook free mid-stretch and held on
under a driving finish. ULTIMATE tracked the early pace, chased two wide around the turn then given cue three wide upper stretch, edged up closer then
finished gamely and closed on the winner. NO SHIRT NO SHOES settled through early stages then chased three wide around the turn, sustained bid into
the lane and got up late for show. MINISTER OF SOUL dueled inside of the winner through the backstretch and battled on into the lane, could not match
strides mid-stretch and gave way grudgingly. CHICKS DIG SCARS tracked the embattled pair in early stages, chased inside around the turn then faded in
the lane.

AMERICAN COALMINER set a pressured pace through the backstretch and around the far turn, roused for more at the head of the lane, responded
willingly and drew off. KEEN CONTENDER settled in the back through early stages, picked up the pace and circled up closer late on the far turn, swung five
wide into the lane and finished clearly second best. LOFTYSHIPSLOWSAILS stalked inside through early stages, hustled up two to three wide in upper
stretch and ran along for a share. MIZHIPZLETUS tracked the pace two to three wide, chased two wide around the final turn then faded through the lane.
BRINA rated three to four wide through early stages, coaxed three wide around the far turn then retreated. BOOTLEGGING GIRL prompted the pace
through the backstretch and around the far turn then emptied out.

FLEETRIDGE stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid midway around the far turn, cleared command in the upper stretch
and held late under a driving finish. DEANOS CAPE was reserved and raced in the back, saved ground around the far turn then shifted out in upper stretch,
gathered momentum under a drive, rallied gamely along the outside and closed on the winner. JOE FRAZIER tracked the leader through the backstretch,
advanced three wide to engage rivals for the lead at the quarter pole, could not kick on with the winner at the head of the lane but sustained bid and secured
a share. ITS A WRAP set the pace through the backstretch, got collared for the lead late on the far turn and retreated through the lane, bled while racing.
NEWPORT BEACH raced in contention around the first turn then dropped back and trailed throughout.
