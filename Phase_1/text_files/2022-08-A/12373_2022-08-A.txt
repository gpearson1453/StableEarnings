BRADLEY'S COWBOY veered a bit breaking sharply clearing the field moving off on the turn taking a commanding lead to upper stretch being ridden out
finishing under wraps. IN THE GOSPEL chased a loose leader through the turn saving ground to upper stretch showing as clearly second best there along
the rail. ELUSIVE MOTION moved evenly racing inside to upper stretch finding no surge there while holding the others safe. REGAL HOLIDAY was in tight
on the rail steadying near the seven sixteenths pole. STRONG SAFETY carried out a bit at the break pursued a loose leader through the turn wearing out in
upper stretch. GOLDEN HUGHES was always outrun.
