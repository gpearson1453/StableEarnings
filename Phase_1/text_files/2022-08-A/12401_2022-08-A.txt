then made a bid in the late stretch and was closing willingly. SWEET JUSTICE bid in close early then dropped back slightly to chase the pace while three
wide then menaced in the stretch and was no threat. BROOKVILLE STORM broke awkwardly at the start then was unhurried early to make a mild bid from
the inside on the turn and was no threat. SUMMER HOME was unhurried early then was gaining ground while four wide on the turn, was hard used and
tired in the stretch. LADY DONT MIND raced in the the middle of the field while three wide and failed to rally.

and missed third. DREWZANO was bumped at the start then was gaining ground steadily while two to three wide on the turn to close willingly in the stretch
drive. GUARD DUTY chased the pace while two wide then bid gamely between rivals in the stretch and was closing well. ALL THE DIAMONDS chased the
pace from the inside then rallied in upper stretch but had no closing bid. HIGHEST PRAISE was bumped at the start and was out run.

Footnotes
GO EMI was in a steady gain while four wide on the back stretch into the far turn, then menaced gamely mid stretch, passed the faltering leader and was
kept to task under a strong hand drive. HALOO set the pace down the backstretch into the early stretch, was used up and gave way. KENTUCKY MIST
tracked the pace from the inside on the back stretch into the far turn, then menaced in upper stretch and was no threat. VERSATILE chased the pace from
the inside, was in a long drive to bid on the second turn but flattened out in the stretch. ONEMORANDTHECHECK chased the pace while three wide then
started to fade at the top of the far turn and failed to rally. GO BALI GO was unhurried early and failed to menace. YOUNEVERWALKALONE was unhurried
early, then continued to fade throughout the course and eased across the finish line.

Footnotes
FRENCH CUFFS hopped slightly at the start, then tracked the pace while three wide, was in a hard drive on the far turn, then dug in grudgingly to duel with
an inner rival in late stretch and was up at the wire to prevail. FAST SUMMER chased the pace while two wide then gained command at the three eighths
pole, continued to dig in gamely then dueled to keep the lead but was over taken at the end and was second best. FORGOTTEN REALM tracked the pace
from the inside to rally while four wide on the far turn to close well in the final furlongs. PORONUI raced between rivals on the back stretch, was gaining
ground to bid gamely on the far turn into the stretch but was caught for the show prize in the end. SASSY SAGEY chased the pace from inside into the
upper stretch to make a mild bid but came up evenly in the end. MORNING ANGEL was unhurried early then was in a steady drive to bid four to five wide
on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. MRS. K set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive, was used up and tired at the top of the far turn.
SAMMIES SAMURAI settled along the inside and failed to rally.
