IRISH LUNA broke sharply and stalked the pacesetter while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, continued to save ground while rallying along
the inside through the final turn, slipped through at the rail entering the lane, overtook JERSEY LILLIE in mid stretch and inched clear late. ALWAYS IN
CHARGE away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, commenced her bid two out from the rail entering the final
turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to get up for the place. JERSEY LILLIE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering
the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, held the lead into the lane while racing one out from the rail, but was
outfinished late while holding on for a share. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing four wide in the stretch drive. SUNGOLD BEAUTY settled off the early
pacesetter while racing two out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing
response when called upon.

backstretch and collared the leaders while racing two out from the rail entering the final turn, took control midway through the turn, and drew clear in the lane
while being ridden out in deep stretch. RICHARDS COMMAND tracked the leaders into the stretch while saving ground at the rail, was steadied while racing
up on heels approaching the second turn, was wrestled back off the pace entering the backstretch, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn , and
finished willingly five wide in the drive to get up for the place in the closing strides. TAKE CHARGE GWEN dueled for the lead from the outside of OMBRE'
ROSE entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide through the second turn and in the run down the backside, rallied two wide from between rivals
entering the final turn, was no match for the winner over the final furlong and just failed to hold the place. OMBRE' ROSE away alertly and vied for the lead
from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside of TAKE CHARGE GWEN through the second turn and in the run down
the backstretch, struggled to keep up entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. BAKZONE broke sharply and tracked the leaders three
wide entering the stretch the first time, maintained her position into the backstretch, dropped back to trail approaching the final turn, and had nothing to offer
late.

LAUGH WITH ME chased the leaders four wide into the first turn, before racing into a tracking trip one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch,
rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and ran down a stubborn RING OF KERRY in the closing strides to prevail. RING OF KERRY pressed the
pace three wide entering the first turn before taking command from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, maintained the lead through the final turn,
and just failed to last in a solid effort. SANAWAR away well and was allowed to settle off the early pacesetters while racing two wide into the first turn,
maintained his position in the run down the backside, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished willingly three out from the rail in the
drive to garner a share. WISE MARKET broke sharply and dueled for the lead two wide from between rivals entering the first turn, before dropping into a
stalking trip one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid three wide while battling for the lead entering the final turn, but was
outfinished late while finishing three wide in the drive. WE'RE IN COMMAND unhurried early while dropping back to trail in the run to the first turn, bided his
time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied four wide through the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact. VON DOM
away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering he first turn, before taking a tracking trip from along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied
along the rail entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

MONTE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and through the
final turn, and was never seriously tested late. SHOWMAN unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched his bid two out from the rail through the
final turn, and finished with late interest three wide in the drive to get up for the place. ROLLIE'S SPIRIT drifted four wide entering the first turn while under
snug restraint, before taking a three wide stalking trip in the run down the backside, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished willingly
two wide in the drive to garner a share. FAULKNER settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid
two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest from along the rail in the stretch drive. THREE DAY BENDER away well and stalked the
leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded over the late stages. JUST FREDDY settled
off the early pace while racing three out from the rail, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backside, but weakened over the final furlong while
continuing with a wide trip.

VALUE MAX stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly from just off the rail entering the final turn, tipped three
wide entering the lane to collar the pacesetter, and quickly assumed command and drew clear late under confident handling. HARVEST DAY raced to the
lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace from along the rail in the run down the backside, maintained his advantage through the final
turn, was quickly tackled and overtaken entering the lane, but finished willingly from along the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. BARNEY
GOOGLE broke sharply, but was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied three wide
entering the final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive to get up for a share. NORTHERN KID hopped slightly at the start, and trailed the
field into the first turn, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and
finished well from just off the rail in the drive to just miss the show position. MT SEYMOUR was fractious prior to the start, but was away alertly and tracked
the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. ATOMIC HAZE
away well, but was allowed to settle well off the early pace while racing four wide into the backstretch, continued with a wide trip throughout, and failed to
respond when called upon. BETTIN' MAN was fractious prior to the start, and had his head turn to the inside as the gate opened, and never left the gate.
BETTIN" MAN was declared a NON STARTER following a stewards inquiry.
