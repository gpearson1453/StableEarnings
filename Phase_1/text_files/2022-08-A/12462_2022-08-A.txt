down the lane, exchanged bumps late with the winner and yielded in the final stages. BERATE chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane,
made a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. DUPLICITOUS set the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the
stretch run. NECK ON THE NILE was bumped at the start, raced back early on, was bothered in the upper stretch, lugged in near the eighth pole and
