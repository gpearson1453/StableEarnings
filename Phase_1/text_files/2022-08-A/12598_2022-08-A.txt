Footnotes
SILVERWIND away well, asked for speed and delivered, cleared heading into the turn and improved margin through the turn, kept to task in the lane and
won convincingly. PRINCE RICKY bumped in at the start, showed speed to hold rail and chased clear leader, continued on the rail on the turn, entered
stretch in the two path and earned second money by holding off closing inside rival. JOURNEY CAKE broke in and bumped rival at the start, stalked pace
along the rail on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn and launched bid in a tight spot along the rail, kept to task in the lane but failed to get
up for place. TRUMPER broke out, chased leader in between rivals on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch in ranged and
outkicked when the real running started. SURPRISE FASHION off bit slow, settled off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, attempted
to rally four wide entering the stretch but failed to have the needed response. TIZ INDY away well, chased clear leader on the backstretch three wide,
continued three wide on the turn and started to tire entering the lane.
