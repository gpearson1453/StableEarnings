Footnotes
GRAND ALLIANCE broke sharp to lead, opened up on his rivals through the turn and continued to widen throughout the stretch to win unchallenged.
CHAIRMAN FOX chased the pace down the backside, was passed in upper stretch for second money and stubbornly rebid late between runners to regain
place at the finish. BORN HAPPY was outrun early, made a rail move entering the turn for a good position tracking, rallied inside at the top of the stretch
and stalled a bit in the last sixteenth losing second at the wire. FORITTABLE stalked mid pack between runners through the turn, was ridden with a quarter
to go to keep up with the frontrunners and was one paced down the lane. SMART SOCIETY was roused while slow into stride in the early stages, angled to
the rail saving ground through the turn, contended for a minor share while on the fence in upper stretch and levelled out the final furlong.
SUPREMEACTION raced wide through the backstretch, made a brief run three wide on the turn, was roused at the top of the stretch and could not contend.

Footnotes
MR. AGRO was bumped repeatedly albeit lightly from both sides at the start, settled two to three wide in the back half of the field, began to advance while
swinging six wide into upper stretch, struck the lead outside the furlong marker, kicked clear and was kept to the task. LATE SURGE settled inside toward
the back early, shifted out to go three wide on the far turn, fanned eight deep into upper stretch, followed the winner from outside but made no headway on
that one while getting up for place. BRUTALITY exchanged repeated light bumps at the start, was unhurried early shifting to the rail and trailing, saved
ground on both turns and improved position inside but was outkicked for second. CAM WOOLLEY eased back off the pace from between runners tucking in
behind three wide, tipped out once on the backstretch, advanced five wide and outside on the far turn, ran on evenly. FOUR BOUNCE exchanged repeated
light bumps at the start, vied inside runners but off the fence for the lead, drifted out into upper stretch, needed more late. SUMMER SHANDEE tracked in
behind two wide, failed to rally. INCENDIO vied between runners to the first turn going three wide on that bend, continued to be up close and between
runners three deep on the far turn then weakened. BLUE SNOW was urged forward at the start, raced close up and four wide, dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
MUCHOKOVA tracked the pacesetter at the half, was patiently rated through the far turn waiting for an opening to engage the leaders, angled out turning for
home to take over with a furlong out and was drawing away late. RUNNINFORCOVER was three wide into the first turn, was asked to challenge the
frontrunner going into the far turn, assumed command at the top of the stretch and gave way with an eighth to go narrowly holding place at the wire.
INFAMOUS COVERT trailed runners in the far turn, rallied with a quarter to go advancing up the fence mid stretch and just missed getting the place award.
JUST START ME UP stalked mid pack between runners in the beginning, waited inside runners into the far turn, found a rail seam in upper stretch, angled
out four wide midway down the lane and showed some late energy in the final furlong. AMMUNITION made an early move through the backstretch to
contend into the far turn, was ridden to keep up entering the stretch and retreated. HAYROLL trailed inside early, advanced between runners down the
backside, was five wide on the far turn and could not be a factor in the late stages. MAD DOG N JOE broke alertly to lead, set all the fractions until the top of
the stretch, was then collared and stopped inside through the lane.

Footnotes
MILLIE GIRL pressed three wide into the turn, struck the lead by the quarter pole, drifted out a bit in upper stretch while moving clear, held well while being
kept to the task. GLORIANNIA settled toward the back outside, went three to four wide on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, loomed a threat but
could make no headway on the winner while second best. GAMBLING CAT raced in behind the leaders two to three wide into the turn, lacked room briefly
about the half-mile marker, came out a bit in upper stretch brushing a rival lightly, ran on to get up for show honors. STARLIGHT RIDGE tracked inside not
cornering all that well into the turn while in behind and inside rivals, came out two to three wide for the drive, was outkicked for show honors. BOBBI'S
LEGACY settled and shifted in early racing toward the back, went in the two to three path on the turn, improved position. EMMELINE broke outwardly,
chased the pace from outside, went four wide on the turn and asked for more outside the quarter pole, was brushed lightly and briefly in tight about the
three-sixteenths, switched out after that and kept on. HIT AND RUN set the pace with some outside pressure, moved nearer to the rail into the turn, came
up empty for the stretch. MUSICAL RIDE got away alertly, stalked the leaders from outside, edged closer five wide on the turn, faltered in the stretch and
faded.

Footnotes
WHICHWAZE pressed the pace down the backside, contended for the lead turning for home between runners, fought on stubbornly the last eighth never
giving way to an outside rival. ATTABE tracked the pace just outside, loomed at the top of the stretch to challenge for the lead, battled with the winner
through the lane but could not get by late. WITCH HAZEL showed good speed leading into the far turn, opened up on her rivals through the turn, was
challenged by outside runners with three sixteenths to go and battled on determinedly inside giving away the last part. BIJOU BABY commenced a run with
a quarter to go, angled out in the seven path turning for home and showed some good energy finishing well while not switching leads. JUMPIN JUNIE was
ridden while on the rail throughout the turn and passed tiring runners down the stretch. CENTENARY stalked four wide down the backstretch, was asked
through the turn to go after the frontrunners and offered little response. PANIC SWITCH trailed runners on the turn, angled out widest turning for home and
had no finish to offer. ESME was void of early speed, roused on the turn, offered a brief run and was one paced through the lane. HEAR ME KNOCKING
made a mild rally inside on the rail into the turn and weakened at the top of the stretch.

RACE FOR PINKS stalked off the lone leader early, advanced two to three wide on the turn taking the lead by the quarter pole, kicked clear and held sway
under steady handling. HEAT MERCHANT switched outside foes and advanced three to four wide, moved out five wide turning for home, was gaining but
too late. ADELAIDE COURT saved ground tracking inside till the end of the turn, tipped out four wide for the drive, moved back inside a rival in mid-stretch
and kept on. SOUPER PRONTO sped clear and shifted in to dictate terms on the front end, had no extra for the stretch. TARA TATTOO was in a bit tight at
the start, moved out up the backstretch, went three to five wide on the turn, swung eight deep for the stretch, gained too late. PRINCE SUSSEX chased
from outside four to five wide through the turn, flattened out in late stretch. BIG BROWN BREWSKII raced outside well back going four to five wide on the
turn and coming out a bit further for the stretch, moved in through upper stretch and failed to menace. SIR GRAYVENSCROFT broke outwardly, raced
inside, failed to rally. HIGHLAND SOCIETY was forwardly-positioned early racing two to three wide, came up empty. STEEL WOOL raced well back
outside, moved out four wide later on the turn, was never near enough to threaten.

LADY SPEIGHTSPEARE stalked just outside for the first part, was in a good position entering the far turn keeping the leaders in close range, loomed boldly
with three furlongs out, headed the leader at the quarter pole and fought on with an inside rival mid stretch to win inching away the last sixteenth.
DREAMING OF DREW hounded the early pace just outside, took over the lead from a faltering runner with three eighths to go, was headed by the winner
outside at the quarter pole and battled while on the rail down the lane giving away grudgingly to be second best. KATE'S KINGDOM started to rally five wide
circling runners midway on the far turn, had a clear path for the run down the lane and closed well outside to get up for third. TALBEYAH (IRE) was allowed
to settle near the rear in the beginning, began to rally between runners on the far turn weaving her way through horses entering the stretch and finished well
inside closing to get a minor share. LAKE LUCERNE went five wide into the first turn, rated mid pack outside down the backstretch, was ridden to go after
the leaders midway on the far turn, angled out in the five path at the top of the stretch and showed some late interest in the final eighth. NOVEMBER FOG
rated between rivals with the frontrunners in sight at the half, moved at the quarter to contend turning for home and levelled out the final furlong. ALYDIVA
broke inwards at the start, was last into the final turn, angled out for the drive and passed tiring runners through the lane. IL MALOCCHIO settled behind
horses with a half to run, waited through the far turn for running room and when clear at the top of the stretch could not offer a finishing kick. CRYSTAL
GLACIER trailed early going five wide into the first turn, advanced outside runners through the backstretch, continued to charge going four wide on the far
turn to contend with a quarter to go and weakened between runners in the final furlong. INTHEWINNERSCIRCLE raced four wide throughout, was shuffled
back to trail after the half, angled out widest mid stretch and had no finish to give. DREIDEL sat just behind the early pace down the backside, was ridden on
the rail in the far turn and could not offer a stretch rally inside. LOVELY RIDE broke sharp and carried that speed to lead in the early stages, was collared at
the three eighths pole inside and folded through the field on the far turn.

Footnotes
SECRET RESERVE switched off the inside racing mid-pack two to three wide on the turn, came into upper stretch four wide, drifted out in late stretch while
taking the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and just held from a late challenge by CANDY OVERLOAD, who was well back early racing off the inside, went
three to five wide through much of the turn, angled out past the quarter pole to enter the stretch eleven deep, was gaining but too late. AVIE'S FLATTER
was forced in early by a rival then switched outside that one, went two to three wide on the turn still well off the leaders, angled seven wide in upper stretch,
bid in mid-stretch but was no match for the winner and lost place late. LUCKY SCORE settled off the pace going three to four wide on the turn, showed
good turn of foot to gain late inside but needed more. ROARING FORTIES got away alertly, settled in to stalk just off the leader racing two to four wide,
made a brief and mild bid turning for home taking a narrow and brief lead about the three-sixteenths but lacked the needed late kick. RED RIVER REBEL
settled off the pace, went between rivals three to four wide on the turn, moved out eight deep in upper stretch and ran on. OUTADORE was carried in
through the early going, switched out midway up the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn just off the leaders, asked for more nearing the quarter
pole, loomed a threat in upper stretch but had no late kick. WHITE FLAG settled off the pace, went four wide on the turn, swung nine deep turning for home
and ran on evenly. MASON'S GAMBLE exchanged a bump at the start and just after, chased in behind the leaders shifting in, saved ground near the rail on
the turn, asked for more outside the quarter pole but had no response and faded. SOUPER STONEHENGE was well-placed mid-pack, went four wide on
the turn, was forced eight wide into upper stretch, shifted in through the lane, failed to rally. LAST AMERICAN EXIT exchanged a bump at the break and just
after, raced two to three wide into the turn, dropped back on that bend and shifted in, failed to rally. NOBALS was urged to the lead, set the pace near the
inside, drifted three wide into upper stretch, tired. HELIUM angled to the rail early, saved ground but was unable to threaten.

Footnotes
QUIET SUNDAY was allowed to settle at the back early to trail, circled runners five wide midway on the far turn passing runners easily, took the lead with an
eighth to go and drew away comfortably at the wire. NORTHERN PASSAGE came away from the first turn to track nicely on the inside with a half mile to
run, began to rally on the fence mid point on the far turn and split runners at the top of the lane to close well through the stretch to get up for second place.
MIDNIGHT ARKLE was in a good position between runners at the half, advanced through the turn to briefly lead in mid stretch, gave way between rivals
with an eighth to go but courageously fought on to come back to regain third at the wire. SILENT LUCIDITY bore out considerably into the first turn,
recovered to track the pace through the backstretch, contended turning for home between runners but could not find enough late and had to settle for a
minor share. BET took back soon after the break to save ground into the first turn, was roused through the far turn only to lose position and passed
weakening runners late in the race. GIANT ONE was floated out five wide on the first turn, continued to be wide through the backside, and began to weaken
at the mid point of the far turn offering nothing for the drive. IT WORKED was reined in entering the backstretch, roused on the far turn between horses and
came up empty for the drive. PRIMORDIAL FEAR took the lead into the first turn, continued to be on top until the mid point of the stretch when collared by
multiple runners outside and quickly stopped the late stages..

Footnotes
BOXER BRIEF exchanged a light bump at the start, forced the pace racing two wide, came out three deep turning for home, drew clear and held safe.
MAGIC SPIN settled just off the leaders racing outside, went four to five wide on the turn, was forced out eight wide leaving that bend, ran on to get up for
second. CONDITIONAL broke a step slowly, steadily advanced inside up the backstretch then between runners two to three into the turn, drifted six wide
coming out of that bend, lost the place late. ECHO WITH LAUGHTER switched out early and lacked early speed, swung seven to eight wide and improved
position. MIDNIGHT RAMBLIN was hard to load, raced three to four wide between rivals on the turn, was forced out seven wide past the quarter pole, had
no late kick. MAN OF STEEL was a bit fractious in the gate, bumped with a rival lightly at the start, had brief early speed pressing inside, steadily dropped
back. TOOK A WRONG TURN failed to threaten while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
MS VANCOUGAR had a good outside tracking position down the backside, settled nicely just outside off the pace through the turn, found a seam turning for
home, split horses quickly to lead with a furlong out and was kept to the task to the wire. STOP WAR led through the first half, repelled a mild challenge from
an outside rival at the quarter, fought inside mid stretch with the winner, and had enough left late to hold for second. HELL N WILD broke sharp, rated back
off the pace in the beginning, advanced inside runners through the turn, was in the five path when angled for the run to the wire and was gaining steadily in
the late stages. AFLEET KATHERINE stalked mid pack throughout the turn, angled out for the stretch drive in the six path and ran on well late just missing
getting up for third money. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE hopped on the break, began a charge inside in upper stretch looking for a clear path behind runners,
found some traffic issues running between rivals in the vicinity of the eighth pole but still finished with good energy late. VERDEJO was ridden outside
turning for home and ran one paced through the lane passing tiring runners. HELLO FRIENDS commenced a mild rally while angling out in the seven path
with a quarter mile to run and levelled out with a furlong to go. BEAT THE SYSTEM hustled outside after the break to press the lead through the first half,
roused for the drive in early stretch, could not keep up and tired through the field the last eighth. GOTE GO trailed the field through the turn, angled out
widest in the nine path turning for home and could not get involved. JILLI MARIE stalked mid pack outside, was roused at the top of the lane in the six path
to be in contention, began to weaken with three sixteenths left to go and faded late. SHE'S A DREAM sat behind the frontrunners in an inside pocket trip
through the turn, steadied briefly nearing the quarter pole and had nothing to offer afterwards.
