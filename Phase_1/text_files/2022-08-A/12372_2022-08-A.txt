Footnotes
SUPER WISE set the pace on the inside and dawdled along while being well handled, was challenged from the inside leaving the turn when SPACE
MOUNTAIN tried to come through a hole that was not there, then remained clear to the wire to prove best under a drive. SPACE MOUNTAIN was well rated
along the inside, tried to make a bid to the inside of the pacesetter leaving the turn but there was not room, checked and angled out by the furlong marker
and finished willingly to be clearly second best. VALENTINE STREET was rated three wide early, then made a four wide bid leaving the turn but hung late.
GOBLER was allowed to settle early, advanced four to five wide by the quarter pole but had no late kick. LIL BIG MAN stalked the pace three wide and then
came up empty in the drive. INCA WARRIOR was allowed to settle on the inside, swung out four wide for the drive but had no rally. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS INQUIRY AND THE JOCKEY ON SPACE MOUNTAIN CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST SUPER WIDE FOR INTERFERENCE BETWEEN THE
THREE SIXTEENTHS AND FURLONG MARKER, AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED THE WINNER AND PLACE THAT RIVAL SECOND.
