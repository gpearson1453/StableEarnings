Footnotes
BACALAR was sent to the early lead, extended the lead along the turn and into upper stretch, felt mid late pressure in the final sixteenth but proved best in
a drive at the end. KERRYGOLD LADY broke in good order, tracked the decent early pace, could not match strides with BACALAR through the turn and into
upper stretch, closed a bit of ground on the winner in the final sixteenth and stayed on well to secure the place. MAGICAL LADY hesitated at the start and
was off slowly, chased the pace to the turn, shifted out to go four wide outside of rivals on the turn, gained ground in upper stretch, was outfinished in the
drive but held for third while challenging for second. SNOW HILL stalked the decent early pace, shifted to the inside entering the turn and gained ground
nearing the quarter marker, could not make headway on the leaders in the drive and was outkicked late. EASTER GRACE was a bit fractious in the starting
gate, settled but was off a step slowly, chased the pace from the inside through the turn and was not a threat in the stretch.

Footnotes
STOLEN VOTE rated off of the early pace, gained ground four wide nearing the quarter marker, continued that rally in upper stretch, got by MY BUCKET
LIST inside of the sixteenth marker and made a strong late surge to prevail at the end. MATT'S MONSTER broke out at the start and was off slowly, lacked
speed to the turn, improved position two wide on the turn, continued that advance in upper stretch, dove to the inside inside of the furlong marker, led inside
of the sixteenth pole and was tagged in the final strides for the win, while besting the rest. MY BUCKET LIST broke alertly and was asked for early speed,
dueled with SEIGE THE DAY through moderate fractions to the quarter marker, shook clear in upper stretch, could not hold off the fast closing top two in the
final sixteenth and was outfinished, while well clear for third. STAN THE CAMERAMAN was off a step slowly, raced in midpack to the turn while just off of
the pace, came three wide to the top of the lane and did not offer a late rally. SEIGE THE DAY was sent to duel for early pace duties, disputed the moderate
pace through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. CALCULATED SPIN was restless before the start and was crowded
leaving the break, chased the pace to the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
YOU KIDDING ME settled off of the early pace, improved position on the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, came within aim inside
of the furlong marker, came to even terms with REBEL GIRL inside of the sixteenth-marker and gamely prevailed at the wire. REBEL GIRL raced close to
the early pace, advanced along the backstretch run and prompted the leader to the second turn, overtook JOHNNY DAR in upper stretch and spurted to the
lead inside of the furlong grounds, met the bid of YOU KIDDING ME late and was just nipped in the final strides for the win, while well clear of the rest for
second. VINNIEBOB stalked the early pace, lost ground to the top pair on the backstretch run, came in tight on the second turn, gained ground in upper
stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong, while getting up late to secure the show. UNUSUAL MEASURE settled three wide off of the early pace,
maintained position through the backstretch run, advanced three then four wide on the second turn, could not sustain that run in the drive and lacked the
needed late response. UNION GIG was unhurried early on and settled off of the pace, saved ground to the second turn, came two wide to the top of the
stretch and could not muster a late rally. JOHNNY DAR was away in good order and went to the early lead, was prompted by REBEL GIRL through the first
half-mile, dueled with that rival through the second turn, could not match strides in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages.

WICKED SUNSET broke in good order and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the turn, extended the lead under firm hand urging
through the lane and edged away in the final stages. GARDEES WORLD broke out at the start and bothered SPUN AWAY leaving the break, prompted the
pace through the turn, could not keep pace with the winner in the drive and was outkicked late, while holding for second in the end. SPUN AWAY was
bothered at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the pace to the turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, was outfinished in the drive and was
edged for second, while well clear of the rest for third. BIG ENOUGH was slow into stride early on, was outrun on the turn and was not a factor. MERGIE
TROID tracked the early pace, chased the moderate pace four wide on the turn, lost ground in the stretch drive and weakened in the final stages.

to task through the lane and pulled away late. DANCE LADY lost her path at the start and was off slowly, recovered to chase the pace through the turn, ran
evenly to mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final furlong but stayed on to secure second. CLEAR WIN tracked the pace to the turn, lost ground nearing the
quarter marker, chased the winner to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong, while clear for third. NISHICO chased the moderate pace, saved ground
through the turn and could not muster a late rally. ENGEE OMBEE broke sharply at the start while taking DANCE LADY's path leaving the break, could not
match strides with the winner to the turn, chased to the quarter marker and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
EL CHARRO CHAMP stumbled at the start and bumped FULL OF LIFE leaving the break, recovered nicely to be forwardly placed to the turn, confronted
SUNSET DRAGUNN nearing the quarter marker, reached even terms with that foe nearing mid-stretch, shook free in the late stages and drove clear in the
end. SUNSET DRAGUNN was sent to establish the early lead, was confronted by EL CHARRO CHAMP approaching the quarter marker, met that bid to
mid-stretch but could not keep pace late and was outfinished, while besting the rest. FULL OF LIFE was bumped at the start, chased the pace to the turn,
gained ground three wide nearing the quarter marker, could not match strides with the top two in the drive and did not produce a late rally, while clear for
third. BERNIE'S BIG BOY broke in a tangle and was off slowly, chased from the rear through the turn, came four to five wide into the drive, improved
position in mid-stretch and flattened out in the final stages. HARDY CHISEL chased the pace through the turn, lost position in upper stretch and lacked a
late response.

Footnotes
NATURAL COLOUR (GB) raced close to the early pace while saving ground, came in tight approaching the far turn and lacked room nearing the quarter
marker, advanced to split rivals nearing the furlong marker and made a strong late run to the wire to prevail. FREEDOM FLYER was away in good order and
kept close attendance to the modest pace through the backstretch run, advanced in upper stretch to vie for the lead nearing the eighth pole, could not match
strides in the final furlong with the winner and was outkicked, while holding for second at the end. NORTHWEST FACTOR was sent to the early lead, set
prompted fractions through the second turn, felt pressure in upper stretch, could not hold off the advance by the winner and was outfinished while just
holding for third. STRIKE AT DAWN stalked the early pace, lost ground along the backstretch run, rallied on the second turn and continued that bid into the
drive, was outclosed late and just missed for third. ASSIGNATION was unhurried early on, saved ground to the second turn, advanced in upper stretch but
could not sustain that run and weakened in the final furlong. IMPERIAL CREED stalked the modest pace outside of rivals, raced evenly through the
backstretch run, gained ground four wide on the second turn, was outrun in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages. REIWA was allowed to settle,
trailed through the second turn, came six wide in upper stretch and did not mount a late rally. MISTY CAT settled off of the pace, maintained position to the
second turn, swung five wide into the drive and came up empty late.

Footnotes
DR. HOFFMAN settled off of the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, was roused along the second turn, swung five wide into the
drive, confronted the leading pair nearing the furlong marker, overhauled those rivals and drove clear in the final sixteenth. LOVE OF THE SPORT rated just
off of the dueling pacesetters early on, mounted a three wide bid on the second turn to vie for the lead into upper stretch, could not match strides with DR.
HOFFMAN in the final furlong and was outkicked while besting the rest. COMMAND A PREMIUM was sent to the early lead and was engaged by two rivals
into the first turn, dueled on the front end through reasonable fractions to the second turn, felt pressure from LOVE OF THE SPORT in upper stretch and
battled with that foe to mid-stretch and yielded to the top pair in the final stages, while just saving third at the end. OH GREAT (IRE) settled into a rail
position behind the dueling leaders, gradually moved into contention around the turn, launched a bid approaching the stretch while remaining on the rail,
finished with some interest but was outfinished for third. STRAUS'S PLACE lagged through the far turn and was not a threat. ROARING TIGER away in
decent order, eased into a three-wide position on the outside of the speed duel up front, kept pace to the top of the stretch then tired badly.
LEAVEITONTHEFIELD was off a step slow, then brushed with LOVE OF THE SPORT, rushed to gain a forward position but ended in the middle of a
three-horse speed duel for the lead, kept pace to the three-furlong marker then dropped back and was allowed to gallop to the wire well behind the field.
