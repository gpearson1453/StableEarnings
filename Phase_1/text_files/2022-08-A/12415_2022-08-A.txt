Footnotes
HOT LE ROY forwardly placed out of the chute toward the inside, remained within striking distance up the backstretch and into the turn, came in the two
path for the drive, split foes when moving to challenge past the furlong marker, held sway late under firm handling. RITHMICALLEA underwent a shoe repair
in the paddock, raced closest to the leader crept closer to that one two to three wide exiting the turn, challenged on the outside while holding an advantage
over the winner past midstretch, could not match that one late, edging clear for the runner up position. SOUTHPINE GIFT in the main body while racing
outside, three to four wide entering the stretch, mild late rally to be up for the show. FRIENDOFTHECOURT broke alertly, cleared to the inside, set the pace
for six furlongs, responded when challenged with a furlong remaining, gave ground grudgingly until late. LIAM SKYE last to leave, trailed early, improved a
bit into the lane while three wide but lacked a serious bid in failing to menace. PARTY OF FIFTEEN raced off the pace and the inside, was also three wide
exiting the turn, failed to produce a rally as well. CAEUS IN PASADENA saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
BECCA'S BOUQUET broke on top, dueled up front closest to the inside, shook clear when straightened for home and steadily increased advantage under
steady handling. COCKTAILS AT EIGHT in the second flight early, steered out three wide late in the turn, between rivals entering the stretch, proved no
match for the winner, narrowly gained the nod for the runner up spot. KLEINMEISTER off the early pace while between horses, swung four wide and outside
the runner up turning for home, dueled with that one to the wire while also proving no match for the victor, missed the place. ARKANSAS BLING void of
speed while saving ground, continued along the inside to improve position a bit, posed no real threat. GLADS LOVE CAT dueled up front outside the winner,
first to blink, backed up stretch. MY LITTLE GUERA last away, failed to menace while racing outside.

Footnotes
GOLDEN PALACE away in good order, stalked the pace off the inside, ranged up three wide to challenge turning for home, outdueled entrymate to the wire
to narrowly prevail while between horses at the wire. WISE ANCHOR broke on top, came out soon after to bother ADIEU LE CHAT, was straightened and
chased the leader out of the chute and up the backstretch, engaged that one from the inside before a half, alternated for the advantage through the turn, put
that rival away entering the stretch just as his entrymate was mounting a challenge, raced on equal terms with that one to the wire to just miss. TOO MUCH
BOURBON in the second flight early inside the winner, swung out four wide around that one turning into the stretch while being rouse, lost some ground
then was slowly getting to the top pair late while remaining widest of the first flight at the wire. ADIEU LE CHAT bothered slightly at the start, raced back and
three wide, went evenly through the lane to lack a closing response and pose no threat to the top three. LAURI'S WISH took command soon after the start,
dueled outside the runner up into and through the turn, gave way from between the top two when the real running began at the head of the lane. ELISHER
last to leave, trailed throughout in showing little. PER EVANGELINE DOWNS STEWARDS RULING 25090, GOLDEN PALACE WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM FIRST TO UNPLACED FOR A MEDICATION VIOLATION.

EMERALD FOREST broke with the leaders, allowed the early pacesetter to go soon after, chased that one into the turn, moved to challenge late in the
bend,floated out by that same foe to be four wide into the lane, kicked clear while being kept to task. MY PAL MATTIE broke on top, soon sprinted well
clear, two to three wide late turn as the winner was coming alongside to float that rival out, proved no match in the drive, remained clear of the other two.
GALAXY BUILDER last away, raced in the second flight outside, not a threat to the top pair in going evenly through the lane. GRAND PRADO staged a
steady retreat along the inside, trailed home.

Footnotes
TECATE TIME broke on top, fell back to trail, remained unhurried for five furlongs, began to move far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, finished with
good energy down the middle of the strip to be edging away. DIAL TEN FOR G four wide into the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, advanced
on that one and dueled off the inside through the final turn, put a head in front in upper stretch,drifted out soon after, owned a clear lead past the furlong
marker but could not contain the winner the final sixteenth. CAVE CREEK broke with the field, cleared early, rated onto the backstretch, responded when
the runner up challenged into the far turn, dueled through that bend while continuing inside, began to gradually weaken when straightened for home,
comfortably lasted for the show. IZEONPOINT back off the pace inside, continued to save ground the middle half, lacked a closing response when called on
for the drive. SPELLBINDING settled off the pace and the inside, two path second turn, also came up empty for the stretch run. GLANCE was finished after
a half, trailed home.

Footnotes
BECCA'S ROCKET settled off the pace while four wide first turn, continued outside up the backstretch, still four wide into the far bend when moving closer,
challenged three wide with a quarter mile remaining, dueled through upper stretch then kicked steadily clear the final sixteenth under a firm hand ride. LADY
VALENTINE broke forwardly, clear in the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch along the inside, responded when the winner challenged
late in the final turn, dueled with that one and proved stubborn until late, clearly second best. HANNAH'S HAVEN lacked early foot off the inside, two path
up the backstretch, dropped to the inside midway on the final turn, improved into the lane to finish up best of the rest. HEAVENLY RHYTHM off the pace
toward the inside,moved out and was four wide out of the final turn, set down for the stretch run, managed only an even finish in lacking a closing punch.
WATRUGONNADOKAREN chased the runner up for five furlongs and began to falter. SPECIAL CONNECTION forwardly placed in the early going, was
finished after five furlongs racing just off the inside. AKIANE'S SOLDIER last to leave, trailed throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
FLASHY PREMO with the pace from the start, vied in the two path and between rivals, disposed of the lone remaining speed when straightened for home,
strongly drew clear. BUBBA SMACK close up while widest up the backstretch, five wide into the turn, pressed three wide exiting, no match winner stretch,
clear for the place. PAC THE PULPIT with the pace three wide up the backstretch, fell back from between horses through the turn, went evenly through the
stretch to finish up best of the rest. PRIORITY POINTS set or forced the pace along the inside for a half, closest to the winner nearing the furlong grounds,
weakened the final eighth to lose a couple of positions. LITTLE MAN E DUBAI pressed the issue four wide for a half and had little left for the drive. ROYAL
SOLUTION last away, trailed throughout and was never a factor.
