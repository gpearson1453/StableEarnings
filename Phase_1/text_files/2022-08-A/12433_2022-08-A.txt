Footnotes
MULTI PLATINUM set the pace between foes early, kicked clear around the turn, then drew off under a crack of right-handed urging, drifted in a bit and
which caused the rider to switch to the left-hand in the final sixteenth and coasted nearing the wire. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY hopped a bit bit and came away
slowly, pulled forward and ran up on heels and started to climb at the half-mile pole, rounded the bend two to three wide and finished determinedly to prove
second best. STILL ON THE BOOKS dropped back early, angled down to the inside, angled out late on the turn and entered the stretch four wide, put in a
mild late rally and gained the show. MEMES attended the pace four deep then three deep into the turn, exited the bend four wide and lacked a bid.
HAVAKASH READY forwardly placed five deep early, went four deep into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. NINJA WARRIOR
pressed the pace from inside, chased the winner from rail through the turn and faded. RAISEDAROOFCHARLIE up close early outside the pacesetter while
three deep, chased between into the turn, put in tight by rival and steadied midway around the turn and weakened. SPROSTON off slow to begin, raced
three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, drifted five wide leaving the turn and had little left for the stretch. KAI'S STATEMENT was rank between rivals early
and checked, tracked near the inside around the bend and never responded to urging. SAYERS broke a step slow from outside, coaxed from off the pace
early, raced wide into the turn, got floated out a bit nearing the stretch and weakened.

furlong to go, drifted out while reeling in the leader and just missed. SEE THROUGH IT forwardly placed three deep early, got shuffled back a bit early on
the turn between rivals, came three wide into the lane, moved out further and finished gamely outside the top pair. BLAMELESS was off a bit slow, tracked
two then three wide on the turn, tipped out in the drive and closed well from outside. JAMMING EDDY stalked on the inside then tipped two wide around the
bend, lacked room behind rivals in upper stretch and altered out to a clear path and kept on while unable to threaten. NEWPARK (IRE) raced up close
between foes early then moved to the inside, saved ground to the stretch and lacked late kick. CHAOS THEORY tossed his head and spotted the field
several lengths at the start, raced along the rail then tip two wide, steered out in the stretch and made no impact. COTOPAXI (IRE) prominent four deep
early, angled in a few paths and took aim at the leader two wide into the stretch but flattened in the late stages. ESTABLISHED brushed outside rival at the

leaving the gate, chased wide early on, entered the turn in the five path, exited the bend six wide and finished willingly to gain the show. SMITTEN BY
KITTEN closest in pursuit to the outside of the pacesetter early, chased three then four wide on the turn, bid between in upper stretch and faltered in deep
stretch. ANNIE GRAHAM stalked from inside then a bit off the rail on the turn, challenged inside a quartet of rivals in the drive but lacked the needed late
punch. ALTHEA GIBSON tracked off the rail, three to four wide on the turn, remained wide into the lane, came out in the stretch and needed to find more.
FULL OF GRACE raced at the back, took the turn two wide and tired.

Footnotes
LADY JAE tracked on the inside then in the two path leaving the backstretch, angled to the rail on the far turn, got boxed in from the five-sixteenths pole to
the quarter pole, tipped out to the two path late on the bend, moved out further in the stretch, rallied to the front midstretch and won going away. NOVELLA
stalked from inside then two wide on the far turn, bid between in upper stretch then moved inside and finished willingly to best the rest. ABOVE ALL NAMES
was off slow in the beginning, rated in the two path, traveled between rivals in middle stages, bid three deep or three wide on the far turn, led into the
stretch, lost command past the eighth pole and faltered in deep stretch. KUORA (PER) chased a bit off the rail then between rivals, drew closer on the
second bend and came three wide into the stretch but flattened in the furlong grounds. ALOHA KITTEN broke a step slow, went three wide around the first
turn, rounded the second bend two to three wide and failed to rally. MADEIRA WINE bumped leaving the gate, showed early speed then chased the leader
from off the rail on the first turn, went up to challenge again and took a short lead dueling on the backstretch, put away inner rival on the far turn and moved
inside while battling ABOVE ALL NAMES, lost command leaving the turn and weakened down the stretch. JOYMAKER off slow to begin, sent for the front
and cleared from inside on the clubhouse turn, dueled with rival up the backstretch and to the far turn, could not keep up around the bend and weakened in
the drive. WHISTLER'S STYLE was off slow to begin, trailed to the far turn off the rail, altered to avoid trouble with rivals past three-eighths pole, exited the
bend five wide, got forced out in upper stretch and failed to menace. CINNTE WINNTE (IRE) was off slow and bumped in the beginning, settled on the
inside, ran up into a tight spot and clipped heels past the three-eighths pole, the rider lost his left-iron briefly but both rider and horse quickly recovered,
came out in upper stretch and churned on to the wire. SONG OF FIRE forwardly placed four then three wide on the first turn, went three deep into the far
turn, started to weaken around the bend and came up empty. A THOUSAND DREAMS antsy in the gate, came away slow, steadied between rivals on the
far turn, stayed off the rail into the stretch and was not persevered with late. THE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT EARLY ON
THE FAR TURN. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT CINNTE WINNTE (IRE) CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS BY RUNNING INTO A
TIGHT SPOT WHICH CAUSED HER TO CLIP HEELS AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
VASCO flew from the gate to taken control, took pressure up the backstretch, cleared in the two path around the turn, drew away under urging and
remained clear to the wire. GRAZEN TOUCH bumped in the beginning, pulled the rider along chasing up the backstretch, angled out in the stretch and
bested the rest. SMILING MOLLY broke a bit at the start, chased then went up to apply pressure from outside, lost touch and chased the winner three wide
through the turn, kept on through the drive and saved the show. THREE POINT OH bumped with rival at the start, chased off the rail then two wide on the
turn and into the stretch and needed to find more late. AIRKITA broke out a bit at the start, tracked outside a rival then between, came three wide into the
stretch, got forced out midstretch and lacked a rally. MARGOT'S GIRL sat off the pace in the early going, raced along the rail into the turn, entered the
stretch two to three wide and lacked a rally. KOKO'S MOM crowded by outer rival and steadied early, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor.
SCATCHMEJAMIN bumped in the beginning, traveled outside rivals up the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn and weakened. MARGOT broke
slow and came in, rounded the bend three wide and failed to menace. SHISH KABOB bumped leaving the gate, stalked from inside, cut the corner into the

SWEET AND CHEEKY stalked the top pair on the inside, moved out a bit and took aim two wide under asking entering the stretch, drew alongside with a
sixteenth to go and drove clear. DEISE DELIGHT (IRE) dueled for the lead from inside, cleared around the far turn, showed the way into the final furlong,
collared by the SWEET AND CHEEKY with a sixteenth remaining, could not match the winner late but was clearly second best. ICE QUEEN tracked the
pace on the inside, tipped three wide into the stretch and bested the rest. ROSES AND CANDY turned her head and got bumped leaving the gate, got put in
tight and steadied entering the first turn, tipped out on the far turn but lacked room behind rivals, angled out to a clear path and kept on for a minor award.
ROCK THE BOURBON settled three wide on the first turn, trailed and moved inward on the backstretch, went two wide on the far turn, steered out in the
lane and improved position. PRECIOUS INSIGHT tracked two wide or outside a rival, raced between on the far turn then angled to the inside and
weakened. SPRING SPINNING broke in and bumped rival, got put in tight quarters and checked along the rail early then became rank into and on the first
turn, went three deep then four wide on the second bend and weakened. STREET SHADOW reserved early in the two path then between rivals, angled six
wide on the far turn and failed to rally. RUN FOR MY HONEY broke out and bumped rival, went up to duel from outside, weakened around the far turn and
gave way. CHEERFUL CHARM broke a bit slow and got bumped, tracked three wide off the pace then came four wide into the stretch and had little left for
the drive.

Footnotes
BLUE STRIPE (ARG) moved into the two path stalking the pace early, bid three wide with five-sixteenths remaining, took over past the quarter pole, kicked
clear in upper stretch and was kept to task to the wire. DESERT DAWN tracked three wide early, chased four then three wide while asked leaving the far
turn, closed willingly through the stretch and edged SHEDARESTHEDEVIL for the place honors. SHEDARESTHEDEVIL broke well then settled into a
stalking position to the outside of the pacesetter, drew alongside the leader leaving the backstretch, took over at the five-sixteenths pole, roused shortly after
when pressured by BLUE STRIPE (ARG), lost command past the quarter pole, stayed on from the fence through the stretch run but got edged for the place.
SOOTHSAY tracked from inside early, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, had little left for the drive. PRIVATE MISSION sped to the front and
led a bit off the rail into the first turn, took pressure from outside leaving the backstretch, overtaken at the five-sixteenths pole and gave way.

Footnotes
CARMELITA'S MAN got bumped early then moved to the inside while allowed to settle, steadied a bit behind rival early on the far turn, remained inside to
the stretch, rallied along the rail and got up in time. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK stalked from inside then moved out first time through the stretch, went up to
press the pace from outside, cleared past the half-mile, responded when challenged by a trio of rivals on the far turn, carried a short lead into the final
sixteenth and got nailed at the wire. THE CHOSEN VRON settled four wide leaving the chute, angled to the inside for the clubhouse turn then became rank
around the bend, raced in mid-pack then took closer order, rallied and fought outside the top pair in the late stages and missed in a blanket finish. NONE
ABOVE THE LAW showed early speed then ceded command and took a stalking position, bid three deep on the far turn, fought through the lane and
finished gamely to wire. FLY THE SKY reserved in the early going, tugged forward and ran up on heels at the three-eighths pole, pushed upon with a
quarter mile left to run, lacked room in upper stretch, tipped out and went between runners and finished with late run. LUVLUV off slow to begin, raced two
wide outside a rival at the back into the clubhouse turn, traveled three deep and got put in tight at the three-eighths pole, remained off the rail to the stretch
and failed to threaten. HOCKEY DAD showed early speed and cleared inner rival first time through the stretch and moved inside, lost command at the
nine-sixteenths pole and gave chased up the backstretch, re-bid between foes with three furlong remaining, battled through the turn and down the stretch
and weakened late. JIMMY BLUE JEANS tracked off the rail, bid four deep on the far turn, got floated out in upper stretch and flattened. TOM'S SURPRISE
got bumped in the beginning, traveled in mid-pack, entered the stretch three to four wide and lacked further response. FREEPORT JOE bumped with inner
rival in the beginning, became rank then got shuffled between entering the stretch first time, bobbled on the clubhouse turn, raced four deep at the
three-eighths pole and failed to rally. IRISH HEATWAVE got bumped and pinched between rivals at the start, raced at the back on the inside, angled four
wide and made no impact.

Footnotes
DUTCH BUS pressed the pace from outside up the backstretch, gained the advantage at the five-sixteenths pole, cleared with a furlong to go and held well
in the end. ALWAYS LITT raced up close on the inside, got blocked behind weakening rival on the turn, tipped out into the stretch and rallied for the place.
CAROL'S COMIC stalked wide up the backstretch, bid three wide into the stretch but was turned away by the winner in the furlong grounds and could not
hold the place. DAMAZIO was off slow to begin, advanced up the inside while pulling the rider along, had to steady off heels at the seven-sixteenths pole,
got boxed in between rivals and behind the leader entering the stretch, angled to the inside and lacked the needed late punch. VANISKY broke a step slow,
got shuffled between rivals at the three-eighths pole, came four wide into the lane and failed to rally. BIG SPIN broke a step slow, climbed behind rivals
leaving the backstretch, got floated out a bit and bumped outer rival past the five-sixteenths pole, entered the lane four wide and could not threaten. RUSTY
B CAUSE was off slow to begin, raced near the inside then two wide into the stretch and improved position. MOURVEDRE set the pace under pressure to
the turn, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole and gave way. O BROTHER broke slow, got bumped and lost his path, raced off the rail at the back, split
foes three wide at the quarter pole and failed to menace. COLLEGE BOY tracked three deep into the turn, got bumped from inside on the turn and came
five wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. SEEK REVENGE broke out and bumped rival, chased between into the turn, trailed two wide leaving
the bend and tired.
