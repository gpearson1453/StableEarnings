Footnotes
CANDY'S DREAM good position to turn, shuffled back a bit, split horses to edge clear late. RADIANTRITHYM chased leader to turn, headed that one to
lead, wore down late. ERV'S WENCH unhurried early, rallied three wide to half, bid stretch empty. ZEBRA CAKE speed to the front outside, led to turn
inside, gave way stretch. L. A. STAR between horses to turn shuffled back, no late response. KERTARA slow into stride, saved ground throughout, no late
kick in the stretch, faded. PRINCESS ATHENA far back to turn, never threatened of rail. CURLIN COED failed to menace.
