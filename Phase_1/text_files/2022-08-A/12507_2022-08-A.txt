RAGTIME DOLLY stuck between horses around first turn, shuffled back into the far turn, angled out into the stretch and cleared off in the late stages under
stout handling. REDHOT KATIE tracked from three wide, ran up outside to a short lead but proved best of the rest. STYLISH ASH lunged at the start,
steadied along around first turn to the half, angled out past the quarter pole to gain a short advantage at the furlong marker but came up empty after a rough
trip from the start. LEXOPHILIA widest first turn, moved up in the stretch run, no menace. CLASS RIOT rail trip to the front to the half, weakened and
dropped back. DANCE THE DAY AWAY bothered at the start, secured good position to the half with nothing left at that point and dropped back readily.

MECHANICVILLE taken back, lagged to the turn, through traffic, split horses in full stride in the late going while tons the best. THEJIGISUP slow into stride
from the gate with a rail trip to the turn while close up, angled out past the quarter pole into the stretch, led late but nailed on the wire. BETTER DASHER
unhurried to the turn, rallied with a wide run into stretch and closed the gap late for the show spot. LUTE'S ANGEL dueled to quarter pole, cleared off in the
final furlong in an all out effort through the late going but run down in a gutsy effort. MORNING DRIVE raced evenly with no late response in the stretch run.
TRUST FUND ROBBER was through after the half and dropped back. HOW IT GOES inside speed, dueled to the quarter pole, gave way readily.
