Footnotes
SARAH'S DREAM prompted the pace in the three path, took over in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. DREAM DIAMOND set the pace in the two
path, could not match strides with the winner in the final furlong but held for the place. TIZ ERIN raced in range three and four wide, lacked the needed rally
and bested the rest. HARMONY ABARRIO failed to menace while racing four and five wide. FROTHY was bumped after the start, raced off the pace three
and four wide and never threatened. CHANNEL'S DAUGHTER bumped soon after the start, raced two wide and played no further factor. INABLINK chased
the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. FAMILY STASH was outrun while racing three and four wide. DOCTOR DAISY was fractious in the gate then had
only brief speed inside. MISS TARISANSOL was bumped twice soon after the start, raced four wide and never reached contention.

Footnotes
SHE FLED THE SCENE bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the two path, was roused into the far turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the
lane, and kicked on to draw past an inner foe in the final sixteenth. CRYSTAL COAST bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the four path, ranged
up to bid under a drive midway around the far turn, took command while angling into the two path at the top of the stretch, ran on but hung on her left lead,
and weas caught in the final sixteenth by an outer foe to place. STREAKING GREY pulled while three wide around the first turn to race from up close in the
five path down the backstretch, took command in the three path entering the far turn, was roused passing the three-eighths mark, but lost the lead passing
the quarter, and flattened for show. LOVE PARADOX prompted the pace in the three path, but faded around the far turn, and drifted out in the stretch.
PLATINUM ROCKER trailed in the four path and never threatened. BOSTON PRINCESS set the pace inside but gaveway around the far turn.

Footnotes
SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL tracked in the four path, was roused in the three path passing the quarter, tipped out to the five path to take aim at the top of the lane,
and rallied clear of an inner pair in the final furlong. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER pressed the outer pacesetter from the rail, was coaxed along around the turn
to bid passing the quarter, dug in along the inside down the stretch, and won a duel for place. BURN THE BREEZE set the pace in the two path, was roused
between foes midway around the turn, fought on from the three path into the lane, but lost a duel with an inner foe to end up with show. HOW BOUT DAT
raced off the pace in the five path, fanned out to the eight path under a drive turning into the stretch, but did not factor on her left lead. MOON ROSE trailed
inside and never threatened. NOBLE DREAMER stalked in the four path, received a right handed cue midway around the turn, floated out to the seven path
turning into the stretch, but weakened.

Footnotes
BARRY THE BUILDER settled off the pace while racing four wide, edged closer four wide around the far turn closed outside, took over leaving the sixteenth
pole and edged ahead under left-handed urging. HOT N LUCKY raced in range three wide, bid in the four path around the far turn, took the lead near the
quarter pole, led to the sixteenth pole and was second best late. THE DOORMAN saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied between
foes for the show. AMERICAN SPEED was strung out five wide around the first turn, angled in early on the backstretch, made some progress two wide
around the far turn but was one-paced through the lane. BEGANINGREENPOINT set the pace in the two path, was collared near the quarter pole, fought on
inside past the eighth pole then weakened late. EDEN PARADISE saved ground off the pace, swung five wide in upper stretch and was no threat. FAST N
STEADY played no factor while racing six wide around the first turn and in the three path rounding the far turn. HIGH STRIKE prompted the pace two and
three wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole and faltered in the lane.

Footnotes
MORGAN POINT vied for the lead in the three path, was ridden in the two path around the turn, dueled with an inner foe from the three path turning into the
lane, tried to lug in and bumped with an inner foe passing the eighth pole, but was corrected, and inched clear in the final sixteenth. ENSIGN PARKER
pressed the pace inside, was roused passing the three-eighths pole, dueled with the outer pacesetter from the rail turning into the stretch, bumped with that
foe passing the eighth pole, and was edged out in the final sixteenth. MODERN LANE trailed in the two path, was coaxed along from the four path around
the turn, floated out to the eight path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. SECRET LOVER had his head turned at the start, raced off the pace in the
three path, was driven in the two path around the turn, but lost the crop passing the eighth pole, and made no impact. HABERDASHERY chased in the
three path and finished evenly in the four path down the lane. EL ROJO VIVO laid up close in the two path early but steadied passing the half, was roused
while swinging out to the five path turning into the stretch, but flattened. GOLDEN SKULL prompted the pace in the four path but weakened from the six
path down the lane. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF ENSIGN PARKER AGAINST THE RIDER OF MORGAN POINT FOR INTERFERENCE
IN THE STRETCH, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS INQUIRY TO LOOK AT THE SAME INCIDENT, RESULTED IN NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
MISTER ABARRIO tracked in the two path, was roused early around the far turn, swung from the four path to bid turning into the lane, drifted out passing
the eighth pole, but inched ahead passing the sixteenth, and held on. REMINDER bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased inside, came under a ride
along the rail going into the far turn, ran on from the two path into the final furlong, but just missed to settle with place. WAR BEAT rated in the four path,
was roused early around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. CATCH A TIGER showed the way in the two
path, received a right handed cue along the rail early around the far turn, tipped out to the three path turning into the stretch, and dug in, but flattened in the
final sixteenth. PRIVATE THOUGHTS hopped at the start, stalked in the four path, came under a drive going into the far turn, swung from the five path into
the lane, but was one paced. GLOBES was unhurried in the three path, came under a ride after the half, but did not factor. THE MAR bumped with an inner
foe at the start, laid off the pace inside but never threatened. TEST FACTOR was held up around the first turn to lay in range from the three path down the
backside, but faded midway around the far turn. ROAR READY raced wellback in the five path and never menaced.

OF A REVOLUTION hit the starting gate, raced off the pace two wide between foes, angled four wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up late.
LOCO ABARRIO brushed GATSBY soon after the start, set a pressured pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed
urging near the sixteenth pole and was unable to the resist the winner late. SAINT TAPIT pressed the pace in the three path, could not match strides in
upper stretch but kept on to hold the show. GATSBY was brushed after the start then stumbled, chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. X Y
POINT chased the pace from the rail and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
ZOZAN bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the three path, was coaxed along in the two path around the far turn, forced his way out to the five
path by bumping an outer foe passing the eighth pole, and rallied past an inner pair late. STEELER MISCHIEF laid up close in the three path, bid two wide
around the far turn, was roused in the three path at the top of the stretch, ran on to lead passing the eighth pole, but drifted out around the sixteenth, and
was caught by an outer foe to place. INTO YOU broke out at the start, set the pace inside, was nudged along the rail around the far turn, dug in entering the
lane, but brushed the rail passing the eighth pole, and evened out in the final sixteenth to show. GIURO stalked in the two path, was cued early around the
far turn, tipped out to the three path turning into the stretch, but got bumped out to the five path passing the eighth pole and had to steady just after, then
flattened. AMBOR NIGHT chased in the four path, was driven around the far turn, but faded. EKATI KING raced off the pace in the two path, had to steady
along the inside going into the far turn, and did not threaten. NOBLE STAR bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the two path and never menaced.
EL CHATO tracked in the three path, sustained an injury approaching the quarter, pulled up turning into the stretch, and was euthanized. AN OBJECTION
LODGED BY THE RIDER OF GIURO AGAINST THE RIDER OF ZOZAN FOR INTERFERENCE PASSING THE EIGHTH POLE WAS DISALLOWED.
