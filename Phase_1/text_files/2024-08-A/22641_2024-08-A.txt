Footnotes
CHANNEL OF LOVE broke well, went straight to the front and was always traveling well, opened up a clear lead going into the turn, extended the lead when
set down in the stretch and drew off to an easy win. BET THE CHALK broke outward at the start, lacked early speed, was well behind the field early, was
ridden to regain contact with the field but was still last going into the turn, launched a bid from the quarter pole, tipped out to the four path into the stretch,
was no match for the winner into the final sixteenth and bested the rest. VALERIE came away well and tracked the CHANNEL OF LOVE from close range,
was unable to keep up when that rival sprinted away in the stretch, kept to task, weakened some in the final furlong, was passed for second but held on the
show under steady handling. AZUCAR CANELA tracked the decent early pace from inside of rivals, was taken off of the rail along the turn and improved
position two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, needed more into the final sixteenth and just missed for third. JUNIORS
KITTY allowed to settle away from the start, chased two wide and between runners into the turn, slipped to the rail into upper stretch, ran evenly to the
furlong marker and flattened out in the final sixteenth. KISSES WITH ROSES was forwardly placed away from the start and tracked the early pace from
between rivals, slipped to the rail and chased the pacesetter heading to the quarter marker, was outrun into upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.
ADDY PEARL hustled away from the start, ran in pursuit of the decent early pace while widest nearing the half-mile marker, was guided three to four wide
along the turn and lost position at the quarter pole, dropped back approaching the top of the lane and came up empty in the late stages. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SUPERSONIC FLYER showed good speed away from the start, assumed early command and set a decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, led into
the turn and set moderate fractions while three wide nearing the quarter pole, came under pressure into the stretch, dug in under urging entering the final
sixteenth, kept foes at bay into deep stretch and held for a determined win. LITTLE LILIANA was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the decent
early pace from between rivals, chased the pace four wide into the turn, confronted SUPERSONIC FLYER into the stretch, battled into the final sixteenth,
could not get by the determined winner in deep stretch and held for second at the finish. BOBBY'S GENIE stalked the decent early pace from between
runners, was well placed approaching the turn and chased the pace two wide heading to the quarter pole, made an inside move into the stretch and vied for
the lead at the furlong marker, was outfinished by the leading pair into deep stretch and was clear for third. HOLLYWOOD RUMOR tracked the decent early
pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole, shifted two wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker
and could not muster a late response. MATCHLESS raced close up to the decent early pace, chased five wide to the quarter pole, went four wide into the
stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and lacked a late rally. BLURSDAY was forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the decent early pace while
widest nearing the half-mile marker, chased five to six wide into the turn and lost ground at the quarter pole, was outrun into the stretch and did not offer a
late response. ZELAIA took back off of the decent early pace, got shuffled back a bit nearing the half-mile marker and trailed into the turn, chased two to
three wide at the quarter pole and did not factor in the stretch drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at
the most accurate time.

loomed at the quarter marker and vied for the lead into upper stretch, took command at the furlong pole, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and drew
clear in deep stretch. STANDFORGRIT tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, chased three wide into the turn and was well placed at the
quarter marker, rallied four wide into the stretch, was outkicked by the winner into the final sixteenth and stayed on to be second best. HARBOR DEAREST
took back off of the decent early pace, went two to three wide into the turn and improved position at the furlong marker, angled out into upper stretch and
made a mild rally at the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth but got up in the final strides to secure show honors. GALWAY SHAWL was
hustled away from the start, showed good early speed and set a pressured pace heading to the half-mile marker, shook free into the turn and carved out
moderate fractions approaching the quarter pole, led into upper stretch, was overtaken nearing the furlong marker, weakened in the final sixteenth and was
outfinished for third. RIVER OF AMBITION tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, saved ground into the turn, maintained an inside path into
the stretch and lacked a late response. STREET TIGER away a bit slowly leaving the start, settled off of the decent early pace, was guided three to four
wide into the turn, raced four to five wide into the stretch and did not factor. LADY WOLF away in good order, raced close up to the decent early pace,
saved ground into the turn and chased to the quarter pole, could not keep pace into the stretch and faded. This race was originally hand timed and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
BOURBON GLAZE settled off of the decent early pace while never far back, tracked the leaders three wide into the turn and was well placed at the quarter
pole, tipped four then five wide into the stretch and advanced at the furlong marker, responded to urging and rallied into the final sixteenth, surged to the
lead in deep stretch and held in the final strides for a determined win. CRY ME A RUNNER broke alertly and vied for the early lead, conceded the front to
CONQUEST SECRET and stalked the pace inside of that runner approaching the half-mile marker, dueled into the turn and took a narrow lead at the
quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and led to the furlong grounds, dug in while kept to task into the final sixteenth, was all out in deep stretch and
was gamely bested for the win, while holding for second at the wire. ROSES R BLUE settled off of the decent early pace, raced two to three wide into the
turn and advanced at the quarter pole, mounted an inside bid into the stretch, vied between runners into the final sixteenth and missed for the win and place,
while clear of the rest for third. CONQUEST SECRET sent to establish the early lead, set a decent early pace while prompted from the inside by CRY ME A
RUNNER, disputed the pace outside of that rival entering the turn, battled into upper stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker and weakened in the late
stages. SAHARA SUE bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried in the early going and trailed nearing the half-mile marker, saved ground
into the turn and trailed at the quarter pole, mounted a bid at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and finished evenly.
GETAWAY CHARM was forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the decent early pace from between rivals, chased from the outside entering the turn,
gained ground three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
CROWNING GOLD sent leaving the start, assumed early command and set a moderate pace heading to the half-mile marker, dictated terms into the turn
and extended the lead at the quarter pole, was kept to task into the stretch, drew off in the final furlong and was geared down in the late stages. REEF CITY
took back off of the early pace, tracked inside of rivals heading to the half-mile marker, was well placed approaching the turn and saved ground nearing the
quarter marker, chased the pacesetter into upper stretch, outkicked at the furlong pole, was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth and ran on in deep
stretch to secure place honors. I'M DR. O allowed to settle in the early running, raced outside of rivals heading to the half-mile marker, chased four to five
wide into the turn and gained ground at the quarter pole, went widest into the stretch, was impeded by a fallen rival at the furlong marker, stayed on into the
final sixteenth and held for third at the finish. DR PESCADO was forwardly placed in the early running, tracked the pace from the outside heading to the
half-mile marker, chased three to four wide into the turn, was outkicked into the stretch, weakened in the late stages and was outfinished for the minor
awards. AZURE STAR (IRE) took back off of the early pace, raced two to three wide into the turn and trailed to the quarter marker, lacked a response in the
stretch drive and did not factor. STRENGTH OF AUTISM raced close up to the decent early pace, stalked CROWNING GOLD into the turn and raced two to
three wide nearing the quarter marker, chased the pacesetter into the stretch, lost action at the furlong marker, fell and unseated the rider, was caught
following the race and walked off under his own power. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

Footnotes
SAINT IVES tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, saved ground into the turn and stalked the leading pair approaching the quarter pole,
tipped two wide into upper stretch and bid between rivals at the furlong marker, battled past mid-stretch and took a narrow lead into the final sixteenth, dug
in into deep stretch and determinedly held for the win in the final strides. IRREFUTABLE broke sharply and sped to early lead, ceded the front to
EVENEREVENWORSE and stalked the decent pace outside of that rival heading into the turn, attended to the pace three wide nearing the quarter marker,
chased into the stretch and vied for the lead past the furlong marker, stubbornly battled into the final sixteenth, could not get by the winner in deep stretch
and outfinished EVENEREVENWORSE to secure the place honors. EVENEREVENWORSE bobbled at the start, broke a step slowly then was hustled in
the early stages, showed good speed and assumed command heading to the half-mile marker, set the pace off of the rail entering the turn, led into the
stretch and was set down for the drive, held foes at bay nearing the sixteenth-pole, was outfinished for the win and place in deep stretch and held for the
show at the wire. TIGER IN MY TANK tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, stalked the moderate pace into the turn and went two to three
wide nearing the quarter marker, angled widest into the stretch, was gaining in the final furlong but could not reel in the top three in deep stretch. TRINIDAD
allowed to settle in the early running, jumped a shadow nearing the three-eighths marker and caused the rider to lose his outside iron along the turn, trailed
to the quarter marker, went three to four wide into the stretch, could not impact the leaders in deep stretch and offered a mild late rally. HAY JUAN took back
off of the decent early pace, raced outside of TRINIDAD nearing the turn, crossed over a path at the three-eighths and saved ground heading to the quarter
marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, lacked a response into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using
video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

MO GOLD asked for speed away from the start, assumed early command and set a decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, dictated terms into the
turn and extended the lead while off of the rail nearing the quarter pole, raced in hand into the stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong grounds, was
kept to task while traveling on the left lead into the final sixteenth and maintained a clear lead to the finish to hold sway. BALLYVAUGHAN GIG broke alertly,
lost the early lead to MO GOLD and tracked the decent pace three deep heading to the half-mile marker, chased three to four wide into the turn, gained
ground at the quarter pole and ran in pursuit into upper stretch, lost ground to MO GOLD at the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner into
the final sixteenth and held well for second in deep stretch. SATANTA allowed to settle in the early running, raced outside of rivals into the turn, gained
ground three to four wide at the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied while widest in the final furlong, could not catch BALLYVAUGHAN GIG for
second in the late stages and was clear in the end for third. SMUGGLER'S RUN stumbled at the break and was off a bit slowly, rushed up and chased the
decent early pace from between runners, stalked the pace two to three wide into the turn, lost position into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. TRIBAL
NATION broke in at the start and was off a bit slowly, rushed up in the early stages and chased the decent pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn
and ran in pursuit to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the late stages. This race was originally hand timed and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
BREVE broke out at the start, spotted the field a little bit of a head start and raced near the back of the field going into the first turn while taking an inside
position, gradually advanced on the leaders down the backstretch, deftly navigated from the inside rail to the four path in the clear at the top of the stretch,
responded when asked once clear of the field, finished strongly under steady handling and was along in time. MARS MAGIC broke alertly then was held up
and fighting the rider a bit heading into the clubhouse turn, was angled to the three path for the run through the turn and pulled forward to a stalking position
behind PROOF OF JAZZ, remained close in the run down the backstretch, was let loose and asked to go on from the three furlong marker, tipped out to the
three path for the stretch run, took the lead in upper stretch under strong handling, drifted in late despite left handed urging and was outfinished in the final
jumps for the win but was well clear of the next horse. SPARKLE SWEETLY came away well and got good position into the first bend, moved up to a
stalking position behind PROOF OF JAZZ as the field started the run down the backstretch, maintained that position to the far turn, went into a drive to bid
for the lead from the three furlong marker, pulled even at the top of the stretch, had trouble changing leads until mid-stretch and was outkicked in the final
furlong. DRAW ME settled mid-pack through the early stages while keeping to the inside, moved up into striking position heading into the far turn, tried to
slip through a hole along the rail but was beaten to it by DERRYGOOLIN, had to steady, then alter course to the four path, re-rallied and was gaining ground
at the end but was too late. DERRYGOOLIN raced close up through the early stages while saving ground along the rail, had to wait behind horses through
the turn, angled into a narrow opening along the rail after passing the eighth pole, could not find another gear when needed and finished evenly. PROOF OF
JAZZ was hustled from the break to get forward position and gained the lead into the first turn without meeting any resistance, was left alone on the lead
through solid fractions, held sway through the far turn, was set down after passing the three furlong marker, surrendered the lead at the top of the stretch,
tired and was outfinished in the final furlong. SELSAE broke outward at the start then got pinballed a few strides into the race, settled near the rear of the
pack, well off the pace, struggled to make up any ground from the far turn and was never a threat. GEA was last into the first turn, continued to trail the field
down the backstretch, chased through the turn, passed one late but was otherwise never a factor. LADY GOOD TROUBLE came away well, got forward
position early racing three wide, tried to launch a bid with three furlongs to run but did not respond, began to lose ground, raced erratically at the top of the
stretch and trailed the field to the wire. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
