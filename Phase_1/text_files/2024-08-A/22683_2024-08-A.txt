DEAR LOUISE reluctant to load, raced three wide early, stalked three wide, bid two wide at the quarter pole, rallied, inherited the lead from a fallen rival,
dueled late and prevailed. SOCIAL LOVE raced two wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, made a late run
outside and dueled to the wire. ON A SUMMER DAY raced three wide early, set the pace with a clear lead on the backside, dueled into the stretch, steadied
to avoid a fallen rival at the furlong marker, then dug in on the rail to the finish. GRAND EMPRESS raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn and closed
belatedly. IRON LADY tracked on the inside, chased on the turn and lacked a bid. ROSE GOLD CANDY stalked between rivals, chased on the turn and
faded. WINNING STREEP off a bit slow, trailed, commenced a strong run on the far turn, cirlced the field, rallied to the front, then veered in sharply at the
furlong marker and lost the rider, walked off. After a Stewards Inquiry into the incident, the race was declared official. This race had a timing discrepancy or
malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
WESLEY THOMAS raced four wide and just off the pace, under encouragement leaving the three eighths pole, worked hard from the outside to engage the
leaders in upper stretch, running on his left lead, ground out the victory late. WEMBY broke a step slow at the start, rushed up along the inside to take the
lead to the quarter pole, lost a little ground rounding the bend at the top of the lane, rebid along the inside from the furlong marker, finished gamely to the
wire. BIG TONE C roused hard soon after the start, was pressing between runners leaving the quarter pole, unable to stick with the top pair, stayed on well
for the show. RUSSIAN HAMMER raced five wide and off the early pace, bid from the outside position around the bend, finished off evenly to the wire.
BADBADBOBBY was slow away from the gate, unhurried into the turn, went by the faders in deep stretch. RAY'S GONE ASTRAY saved ground while
chasing into the turn, angled off the inside nearing the quarter pole, came up empty through the lane. DEVINE FLAMEAWAY pressed on early for speed,
raced along the inside to the half mile marker, and steadily gave way from the quarter pole.
