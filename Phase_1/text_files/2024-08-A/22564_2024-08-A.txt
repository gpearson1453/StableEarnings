Footnotes
SWEET HEIDELBERG sprinted to the clear lead and set all the pace, drifted out in the stretch but continued to draw off to prove best. DIVINE EXCHANGE
prompted the pace from two wide down the backstretch made a mild bid but was no match for the winner. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED stalked the pace from
the inside throughout but lacked the late response. SALAGADOOLA trailed the field to the half mile marker then moved up the rail into the final turn, angled
out to three or four wide into upper stretch and drifted out down the stretch but had no late kick. WEST SIDE GIRL raced in the middle of the pack going four
wide into the first turn then was allowed to settle down the backstretch and was not a factor. HELEONORTIZ raced in the middle of the pack from three wide
around the first turn then tipped in to two wide down the backstretch and dropped back on the final turn.

Footnotes
VINO FROM ERNIES trailed the field to mid turn then moved between horses at the quarter pole, angling out to four wide in upper stretch to make the late
rally under a determined drive to win the nod. JET SPIN pressed the pace from the inside while matching strides with SAINT DEVEREAUX and SLIPPIN'
TIME to mid turn then matched strides with SLIPPIN' TIME to the top of the stretch then drew clear but was denied in the final jump. SIPPIN' TIME vied for
the lead from four wide while matching strides outside of SAINT DEVEREAUX and JET SPIN to mid turn then continued to match strides with JET SPIN to
the top of the stretch and fought gamely but was outkicked by the late closing ViNO FROM ERNIES to the wire. CHILLOW was off a step slow then raced
near the back through the turn, angled out to five wide in upper stretch for a late run at the leaders and missed the show. SAINT DEVEREAUX rushed away
to a narrow lead from between JET SPIN and SLIPPIN' TIME while matching strides to midway through the turn where she fell back slightly but tired late.
KEEP IT SAFE vied for the lead from the inside to the three furlong marker and faded.

AFRAIDOFTHEBUNNY rushed away to set the pace to the final turn then had a mild challenge from STYLE ME ROYAL but was able to fend, drew off in
the stretch and was kept to task. AWESOME FLAY was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack to midway down the backstretch then moved up from
three to four wide through the final turn and made a late run outside of SIVLER STYLE and STYLE ME ROYAL while fighting gamely to be up for the place.
SILVER STYLE stalked the pace down the backstretch, fell back slightly on the final turn but made a rebid to go between AWESOME FLAY and STYLE ME
ROYAL at the eighth pole and fought gamely but was outkicked late. STYLE ME ROYAL pressed the pace down the backstretch then moved to challenge
the leader midway through the final turn, went three wide into upper stretch but bumped with COURT CONTENDER at the three sixteenth pole, kept on to
battle inside of SIVER STYLE and AWESOME FLAY but weakened late and was outfinished. WINGED FOOT trailed to the top of the stretch and passed
tired one. COURT CONTENDER raced near the back while saving ground around the first turn then steadily advanced from the two path down the
backstretch, took aim at the leader entering the stretch but bumped with STYLE ME ROYAL at the three sixteenths pole and gave way.

Footnotes
SWIFT TAP shot away from the gate to an unchallenged lead to set all the pace and won going away while being ridden out. DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY
floated out going into the first turn then chased the leaders down the backstretch from three wide, moved to contention at the quarter pole but couldn't collar
the winner and proved second best. JAYJAYDEE was unhurried going five wide around the first turn then steadily advanced down the backstretch and
made a four wide bid around the final turn while continuing that bid to rally in the stretch but was no match for the top two. WALK AWAY JOE raced near the
back through the final turn then angled out to five wide in upper stretch to give a late kick to improve his position late. CLUBMAN saved ground while racing
in the middle of the pace to midway through the final turn then angled out to three wide in upper stretch and showed late interest to pass tired foes. IT'S
GAME TIME was forwardly place from two wide around the first turn then raced between MUSICAL HEART and DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY to midway
through the final turn but lacked the late response needed. MUSICAL HEART floated out going into the first turn then raced off the pace on the inside down
the backstretch to the middle of the final turn and retreated. HEFFNER raced in the middle of the pace through the first turn then dropped back near the five
furlong marker and was outrun.

Footnotes
PEYTON ELIZABETH stalked the pace from three wide around the first turn then moved up to vie for the lead to the three furlong marker, co-lead outside of
MO TOUGH to the quarter pole and drew clear for the win. MO TOUGH was hustled along to the first turn then cut the corner to co-lead inside of BEACH
ISLAND to the three furlong marker then co-led inside of PEYTON ELIZABETH to the quarter pole but couldn't keep pace with PEYTON ELIZABETH and
grudgingly gave way and was second best. MAKEMEBELIEVE raced in the middle of the pace from the three path around the first turn then move to
contention from four wide at the five furlong marker, stayed on to the final turn but flattened out. BEACH ISLAND went to the front to co-lead outside of MO
TOUGH to the three furlong marker and gave way. LOUISE BROOKS was unhurried to the first turn then moved up to race off the pace on the inside to the
three furlong marker then tipped out to two wide on the final turn and moved between horses at the quarter pole but tired in the early stretch.

DISCO BALL tracked the leader early then moved to engage NOBLE GASTON at the half mile marker and took command at the three furlong marker and
edged away midway through the turn and won going away under light urging. DON'T WAIT UP trailed the field to the turn and saved ground to upper stretch
then made a late rally to be second best but was no match for the winner. DOUBLE EDGE SWORD broke well then dropped back quickly and only passed
tired rival. NOBLE GASTON sprinted to a clear lead to the half mile marker then was headed by DISCO BALL and fought gamely to midway through the turn
and gave way.
