Footnotes
STAGE NAME tracked the leaders from five wide down the backstretch, rallied on the turn under a drive, swept up circling the leaders in upper stretch and
closed best of all to prevail in the final strides. ALWAYSINTOMISCHIEF broke through the gate pre-race, hustled up the fence to the lead after the first
eighth, set the pace under constant pressure from the rail, dug-in gamely through the lane and was bested in the late going. DIAMOND DUST broke alertly
to take the early lead, settled in hand to press from three wide through the turn, battled willingly in the stretch drive and was narrowly defeated in a good
effort. EMPIRE'S FIRE dueled from between horses down the backside while well held, rallied to take a short lead turning for home, pressed on in the drive
in a four way match through the stretch and was out-finished in a good try. EXCITEMENT fractious in the gate pre-race, reserved off the pace to midway on
the turn and rallied to be prominent in mid-stretch and failed to close ground late. MR LOOOCH reserved off the pace while saving ground through the turn,
tipped out two wide to rally rurning for home, was hesitant to split horses in the lane and offered no late kick. HIP HIP HOORAY chased the leaders from five
wide through the turn and failed to mount a closing bid. SPECIALIZED broke a step slow, rallied to be in contention turning for home and failed to sustain
the bid. CHIEF RANDEL stalked the pace to midway on the turn and steadily faded to the back.

Footnotes
FAIR AND SQUARE broke alertly to take command from the gate, set a well rated pace under mild pressure while racing in the three path, responded when
called upon nearing the quarter pole to pull clear in upper stretch and was unchallenged to the wire as much the best. GENERAL MATHIS well placed just
off the pace along the rail to the far turn, was set to a drive midway on the bend, failed to gain on the winner but finished willingly to be clearly second best. I
WANNA WIN prompted the pace for a mile, was no match for ht winner and finished evenly through the lane to hold the show. COUNTRY CLUB BOBBY
stalked the pace from five wide down the backside, failed to mount a closing rally when called upon on the far turn and kept-on in the lane. TANTRUM slow
early to be near the rear of the field, commenced a steady gain leaving the half mile pole and made a belated gain in the stretch. SILENCE reserved to track
the leaders from five wide down the backside and lacked a response when called upon in the final bend. MISTER MOBIL unhurried in the early going to
race near the rear of the field and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. RAVEN MOON pulled early from between rivals down the backstretch to be in
contention and went evely never posing a threat. HENRY MAC tracked the leaders to the far turn and came up empty. TEMPERED DREAM was outrun,
eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
FORTISSIMO stalked the pace from the fence to the turn, was called upon leaving the three-eighths pole to slowly reel in the pacesetter while cutting the
corner at the head of the lane and pulled away through the stretch convincingly. SUPERWOLF prompted the pace into the turn, rallied on the bend to
challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, was repelled by the winner and pacesetter in upper stretch but fought on to re-claim the place in the final yards.
BOOTS MALONE set the pace from the rail, came under pressure at the three-eighths pole, responded to battle on the lead, drifted to the two path allowing
the winner to slip through on the rail, dueled in upper stretch with the winner, could not go with that one and was overtaken late in the drive for the place.
COASTLAND broke outward brushing rival leaving the gate, settled in to a tracking position down the backside and failed to mount a rally when called upon
finihsing evenly. RONNIS SECOND WIND saved ground along the rail to no avail lacking a response when called on. FULL SPECTRUM brushed at the
start, raced at the rear of the field chasing from five wide and never threatened.

Footnotes
GENEROUS LOVER rated well in hand off the pace through the first turn, took command leaving the half mile pole, opened a clear lead when called upon
at the top of the lane and drew off handily as much the best. CANDLELIGHT HOURS reserved off the leaders down the backstretch while hard held, rallied
up the rail entering the far turn and closed willingly to be second best. CHANEL SPIRIT rated through the first turn from four wide to stalk the pace down the
backside, rallied to engage the leader into the final bend, was no match for the winner and kept-on to hold the show in the lane. SHE'S CRAFTY slow early
to be the trailer and showed some late interest rallying rive wide in the drive. HERE'S THE SPIDER went one-paced passing tiring rivals in the stretch. I
RECALL raced in contention chasing the leaders from six wide and flattened out coming home. R THREE ANGELS set a pressured pace for a half and
came up empty.

Footnotes
SILVER KISS moved up in hand to take command shortly away from the gate, set a well rated pace on a clear lead through the turn and drew away in the
lane without being called upon. MY KINDA PARTY stalked the pace from the fence on the backside, was called upon midway on the turn, continued to
respond while hard ridden and finished willingly to hold the place. LO BUG tracked the leader through the turn, rallied five wide and kept grinding along the
outside to miss the place while best of the rest. GOOSEBUMPS slow early to be the trailer and made a steady advance showing late interest without impact.
HOLLABACK raced mid-pack throughout and lacked a closing bid finishing evenly. TOASTMASTER made a middlle moving splitting rivals down the
backstretch to race into contention on the turn and flattened out coming home. FLASHY N leaned into the gap entering the main track, raced along the rail
saving ground to no avail lacking a closing rally. MALEAH chased the pace to the turn and gradually faded. LA ARTISTA failed to menace.

CLEAN MACHINE took command leaving the gate, set a pressured pace to the quarter pole, repelled the runner-up turning for home and drew off in the
lane. HOLIDAYS ARMY BRAT pressed the pace down the backside, rallied to challenge nearing the quarter pole, could not go with the winner and finished
willingly as clearly second best. RUNAWAY POWER tracked the leaders to midway on the turn, circled five turning for home and ground out the show as the
best of the rest. JAC'S EMPIRE broke awkwardly when crowded leaving the gate to be at the back of the filed and ralllied steadily while racing erratically in
upper stretch. AIR RAID showed mild late interest without ever managing to menace at any point. TAKE DICTATION went one-paced without being a threat.
DRILL'S BOY chased the pace early and steadily faded. MOR STORMY was not a factor.

PRACTICALLYELUSIVE set the pace under mild pressure shortly away from the gate, responded when called upon turning for home and drew off through
the stretch under mild urging. LA CUMPARSITA unhurried early to be near the rear of the field, steadily made up ground on the turn and wore rival down in
the lane to gain the place. LOFTY COWTOWN well placed along the fence down the backside, rallied on the turn to threaten nearing the quarter pole, was
repelled the winner turning for home and kept on evenly in the lane. THEODOROPOULOS raced mid-pack, made a bid from five wide on the turn and failed
to sustain the rally finishing evenly. DANZA MAGIC slow early to be the distant trailer and passed tiring rivals in the lane. LEXY ANNA stalked the pace for a
half and weakened in the stretch. SHEZ SHACKED UP prompted the pace in the early going and gave way.

Footnotes
SILENT RULE stalked the pace for three-eighths, rallied on the turn to take command, opened a clear advantage and drew away handily while geared down
late as much best. ROLLIN FREEDOM rated in mid-pack to the turn, rallied four wide under an early drive and finished willingly as second best.
SMARTASSET broke sharply to take the lead early, settled in hand to stalk the pacesetter through the turn and finished evenly lacking a closing kick.
FLAME FOR REAL set a pressured pace to midway on the turn, had no response when challenged by the winner on the bend and weakened through the
drive. BEAUTIFUL CHARADE reserved off the pace to race mid-pack, saved ground to upper stretch, angled wide in the lane and closed with a mild late
bid. CATZANOVA tracked the pace down the backside while well placed along the rail, made a bid on the turn tipping out to split rivals and flattened out
unable to gain ground. JUSTWORTHASHOT went one-paced. MANDAVILLA was not a threat. WHATDID I BUY trailed as a non-factor throughout.
