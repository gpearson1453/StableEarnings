Footnotes
BOURBON AFICIONADO raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the six path coming
around the second bend, began a bid passing the quarter pole and kicked clear in the lane. TWOKO BAY raced in the two path early, continued up the
backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far bend from the three path and improved position in the stretch. IL CAPITANO raced in
the three path around the first bend, led the way up the backstretch, continued around the second turn in the two path and was caught late but kept on to
the finish. THICK HAZE raced in the four path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, swung out
to the five path coming around the far turn and chased on from there. BIG TO DO raced in the two path early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of
the pack between horses, saved ground around the far bend and was outkicked in the final furlong. LORING PARK saved ground around the first turn,
chased the leader up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the four path and weakened in the lane. MISSION KEY trailed the field from the three path
through the opening half mile, continued around the far bend still in the three path and was never a factor.
