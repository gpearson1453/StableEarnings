for show. TIN BADGE edged up on the leader along the rail but got in tight and had to wait for a clear path, tracked the top pair around the turn, cut the
corner and roused along the rail at the head of the lane, raced in striking distance a furlong out then finished evenly and got nipped for show. This race had
a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

RABBIT HOUND was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced in the back, began to edge closer late on the turn, ran on two wide into upper stretch,
tipped a path wider, kicked in gamely and got up late. GO OTTO GO tracked the pace up the backstretch, moved up two wide to challenge for the lead
approaching the quarter pole, held a slim lead then widened advantage and got edged out in final strides. OUR MOON PIE was forwardly placed up the
backstretch, raced three wide in aim at the quarter pole, came four paths wide into upper stretch, ran on evenly in late stages and prevailed for a share.
DON JUAN BUBBA led the way in the opening quarter, vied for command at the quarter pole, fought back in upper stretch then gave way. IRISH DAWN
raced up close in the opening quarter, flattened around the turn and failed to move on in the lane. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and
was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

GETAWAY DAY vied three deep for the lead up the backstretch, shook free still unasked around the turn, came three wide into upper stretch, roused for
more, responded willingly and finished going away while ridden out. CAN'T WANT THAT vied inside of a duo up the backstretch, could not match strides
with eventual winner around the turn but remained up close, cut the corner entering upper stretch and just lasted for place. CHIP SHORTAGE vied between
rivals up the backstretch, could not move on with eventual winner around the turn but remained forwardly placed, came two wide into upper stretch, ran on
and narrowly missed place. MY CAJUN LADY tracked the embattled trio up the backstretch, hustled along four wide around the turn then retreated in the
lane. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
GONZAGA BAY vied outside of NIGHT TERROR up the backstretch, shook free mid-way around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, widened
advantage a furlong out and kept clear under a driving finish. OBVIOUSLY TOO tracked the embattled duo up the backstretch, hustled along two to three
wide late on the turn, sustained bid into the lane and edged closer on the winner. LIBERTY'S HAULER raced near mid-pack in early stages, hustled along
three wide into stretch and finished with good response. NIGHT TERROR vied inside of the eventual winner up the backstretch, could not match with rival
past the midway point around the turn, ran on into upper stretch and flattened in the final furlong. ROSIE'S BOY raced near midpack, hustled along four
wide into upper stretch and needed more for serious impact. BRILLIANT COLORS raced off the early pace, swung three wide into the lane and lacked a
needed rally. JUST JOHNNY raced in contention in the opening quarter then steadily weakened. MOJITO raced in the back, cut the corner entering the lane
and failed to move into contention. AQUIMINE was ridden along the outside racing off the pace, swung five wide into the drive and never menaced.
RIVERSPORT was away in good order and briefly remained forwardly placed then steadily weakened. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction
and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
