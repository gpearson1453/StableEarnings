Footnotes
GATA BRAZIL , a bit rank while rated behind horses down the backstretch, swung outside turning for home, swept to command in mid stretch and eagerly
drew off while ridden out. DIANE LEE prompted the pace in the two path, was no match for the winner the final furlong but was well clear of the rest.
IMPETUS ECHO (GB) , taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and faltered.
SOCIAL LOVE hugged the inner rail around the turn and failed to rally. FEEL THE BOLT raced in the two path between horses much of the trip and
weakened. RODINA , always outrun, stayed along the inner rail throughout and passed a pair of tired horses late. KISSES FOR KATE , four deep on the
turn, was not a factor. MARGO'S MARGARITA , off last, rushed up outside horses down the backstretch, entered the turn three wide, chased the pace to
the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
JOHN HALL , taken to rate soon after the start, settled three to four wide, took closer order mid turn, continued to grind outside rivals while under left
handed asking inside the sixteenth pole, kept on doggedly and got up in the final jumps. ISLAND D'LITE rated forwardly while saving ground, eased out for
the drive, worked his way between runners leaving mid stretch, dropped back inside, challenged for command inside a pair of rivals in deep stretch but
edged in a gritty effort. EGO MAN stumbled badly at the break and was away a few lengths last, regrouped and was nudged up outside rivals to stalk,
moved to engage the leader mid turn, vied three wide outside that one into the stretch, shook clear a furlong out, was joined from both side inside the
sixteenth pole and gave way stubbornly. AEQUOR , urged along while towards the inner rail, worked well out in the track for the final furlong but came up
empty. CAPTAIN CARDO dropped off the early pace, circled four wide under asking into the stretch but failed to generate a rally. BANDITS HEART pulled
his way clear early, set a rated pace towards the inside, was joined by EGO MAN mid turn, fought on to the inside of that one past the three sixteenths then
weakened through the final furlong.

Footnotes
CRISPER , patiently handled between horses down the backstretch and around the far turn, eased outside approaching the eighth pole, closed steadily,
bumped with ELDEST SON approaching the finish and was drawing clear at the wire. ELDEST SON advanced four deep around the far turn, opened a
clear lead in upper stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth pole, bumped with the winner and finished willingly. STORM THE COURT set the pace along the
inner rail and weakened the final furlong. IT'S VIPER saved ground around the first turn, circled the far turn four deep and flattened out. TEE AT ONE ,
swung wide in upper stretch, lacked the needed rally. MR. HUSTLE prompted the pace outside STORM THE COUNT and weakened. GOODBYE NOTE
raced in the three path on both turns and weakened.

Footnotes
LOTTIE DENO brushed with an outer rival at the break, rushed up between rivals soon after and took command leaving the five eighths, dropped to the
inside and handled outer pressure, turned away a threat from STORMY IRISH LASS entering the lane then drew away under a strong drive. STORMY
IRISH LASS , firmly rated saving ground and stalking into the turn, eased out mid turn, moved up to loom into the stretch, was denied by the winner but kept
on willingly to hold down the place. BOND'S BELLE , sluggish from the gate, was hustled along off the inside, raced three wide between rivals nearing the
lane, shifted out a bit near mid stretch, churned on and nabbed the show. LUCKY HONEY settled inside, cut the corner with an advance inside foes in upper
stretch then flattened out. MARGARET P broke sharp and had some speed three deep, was under pressure mid turn, came five wide for the drive and
weakened. LANCE'S SMILE brushed with the winner at the start, hustled up between rivals soon after, pressed outside the winner to mid turn, chased four
wide in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
FIVECOMMATWO stalked the pace inside horses down the backstretch, advanced in the two path on the far turn, bid for the lead outside LADY MOSLER
in mid stretch and narrowly prevailed in an extended drive. LADY MOSLER , quickly clear, set the pace near the rail, was hooked in mid stretch, battled
gamely and just missed. ROMANTIC STORY , four wide on both turns, chased the pace to mid stretch and weakened. OSA lacked speed, swung to the
seven path in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. ONCE AN EAGLE , three wide the first turn, trailed down the backstretch, swung to the five path in
upper stretch and rallied slightly. SHE'SALLATWITTER , inside horses racing near the inner rail throughout, weakened in the drive. SINGALONG was
outrun. QUEEN OF THE DANCE , along the inner rail most of the race, weakened. ARROGATES DREAM , four wide the far turn, weakened. VELVET
VIXEN raced in the three path on both turns, chased the pace to the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
STOP THE CAP , away alertly, settled back off the contested pace while three deep into the turn, responded when given her cue past the three eighths,
advanced four wide under coaxing into the lane, took over outside the embattled leaders in mid stretch then slowly edged away under a drive. JOYA DEL
SUR had speed then was rated back off the leaders after a furlong, sat perched three wide under rating into the turn, bid to engage BOURBON WILDCAT
into the lane, battled on between foes nearing mid stretch, switched over to her correct lead late and battled back to nab the place in the final jumps.
BOURBON WILDCAT accelerated to the inside of rivals leaving the chute to gain a slim advantage, was hounded into and around the turn by SULTRY
SALLY H, got the better of that one past the five sixteenths then braced for more threats into the lane, fought on to deep stretch then gave way grudgingly.
OUR LIBERTY BELLE saved ground off the duelers, gained under a ride into the stretch then flattened out. SULTRY SALLY H forced the pace two wide
outside BOURBAN WILDCAT, failed to kick on entering the stretch and gave way. THE HAUNTED ROOM , between rivals, weakened. SIX THE HARD
WAY broke outward, was corrected soon after but failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
WONDER GIRL caused a jam up when bearing out and bumping SWEETERTHANWHISKEY leaving the starting gate, saved ground around the turn
setting the pace, raced in the two path through the stretch, lost the lead near the sixteenth pole, fought back and got the bob. GIFT OF GAB stalked the
pace, found room along the inner rail through the stretch, gained the lead near the sixteenth pole and hung. LILLY SIMONE , bumped by THE AMAZING
MIZZEN soon after the break, stalked the pace off the rail around the turn, eased outside in mid stretch and rallied. LADY SERENITY prompted the pace
outside the winner to mid stretch and gave way in the drive. NUWANDA stalked the pace, was well positioned in the four path in upper stretch and gave
way. SWEETERTHANWHISKEY , soundly bumped and forced out by WONDER GIRL leaving the starting gate, raced near the inner rail on the turn and
failed to rally. THE AMAZING MIZZEN broke inward, was forced out by SWEETERTHANWHISKEY when that one was forced out by the winner at the start,,
bumped LILLY SIMONE after being carried out then trailed. An objection by the rider of THE AMAZING MIZZEN against WONDER GIRL for alleged
interference leaving the starting gate was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

Footnotes
ARMANDO R settled off the inside while not too far back, was put to a ride leaving the three eighths, swung out six wide gathering some momentum into the
stretch, leveled after some left handed asks leaving the three sixteenths, closed relentlessly outside rivals and got up in the final strides. WHAT DOES IT
TAKE quickly went clear, secured the inside and set a comfortable pace, was joined by FRIGHTLAND entering the far turn, dueled, ceded command
nearing the lane, battled back under left handed asks to regain the lead leaving mid stretch, edged away slightly inside the sixteenth pole, kept on gamely
but just could not withstand the winner's charge. FRIGHTLAND rated forwardly around the first turn then eased out to stalk two wide soon into the
backstretch, bid in hand outside the leader near the half, dueled under confident handling then took over approaching the stretch, came under stern asking
while sparring past the three sixteenths, failed to maintain the lead leaving mid stretch then gave way grudgingly through the final yards. YOUR ANALYSIS ,
towards the inside and behind embattled foes past the five sixteenths, shifted out in the drive and churned on with interest. SEARCH ENGINE , a bit fidgety
in the gate, broke in the air spotting the field a length or two, was used five wide outside rivals into and around the first turn, continued four wide through the
backstretch, ranged up under a ride to be close under asking past the five sixteenths, failed to go on leaving in upper stretch and weakened. TOPS THE
CHART , acting up as the gates sprung, hopped in the air, raced four wide between runners around the first turn, tracked three wide then between foes past
the five sixteenths and weakened.

Footnotes
T C NEIGH accelerated to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, remained near the rail and prevailed under steady handling.
MAGNOLIA WIND , three wide turning for home, chased the winner and finished willingly. ANY FOOLS GOLD hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased
out to the two path in upper stretch, advanced between horses in mid stretch, flattened out and her rider stood up three or four strides before the finish.
GINGERSRACEDAY raced in the two path mid way on the turn, swung four wide entering the stretch and weakened. GRACE IN EXCESS circled the turn
three deep, drifted to the five path turning for home and was not a factor. NEARLY A LADY hugged the inner rail on the turn and weakened. GO WALLY GO
, caught in close quarters between horses entering the turn, lacked a rally. PEACH BLOSSOM broke slowly and trailed.
