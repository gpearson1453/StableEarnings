Footnotes
ZZYZX was outrun for three furlongs, bid two wide into the second turn then inherited the lead when YANKEE PANKEE bolted and drew away in the drive.
GOLDEN PINUP also had no speed while four wide early, followed the winner into the stretch two wide and had to dig in late to hold off BULLETPROOF
TOO for the place. BULLETPROOF TOO pressed the pace for three furlongs then was carried out eight wide by YANKEE PANKEE on the second turn, lost
a ton of ground but gamely finished steadily in the drive to be gaining for second. CHIQUITA PIQUITA chased the pace while saving ground to the stretch,
moved into third when the trouble developed on the far turn but came up empty and was caught for the show. YANKEE PANKEE set the pace then bolted
on the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
WE GOT SWAG pressed to the backstretch then took over, responded once set down and edged away late. GO GABRIELLA tracked the pace two wide to
the stretch but could not impact the winner but saved the place. COLTON'S TIGER had no speed, made a run inside to the stretch then had a mild late bid.
PARTY TIME GAL was mid pack to the second turn while two wide but could not offer the needed late response. CRAZY STORM chased the pace three
wide for a half mile then finished evenly. TREASURE MESA trailed for a half mile and lacked a late bid. HOPS FOR POPS hustled to the lead but stopped
after three furlongs. The photo finish camera malfunctioned and the finish was confirmed by the stewards.

the front late. MATTAWA N THAT stalked the leaders to the backstretch, moved to the front nearing the second turn, responded in the drive but could not
stall the winner. ROMAN RUSH hustled to the front, set the pace for three furlongs, was collared nearing the second turn and lacked a closing bid. MR
MEMPHIS had no speed, raced two wide but could not offer a late response. STARBOARD LIST stalked the pace from the rail to the second turn then
weakened. KEEN JAMES had no speed and was not a factor.
