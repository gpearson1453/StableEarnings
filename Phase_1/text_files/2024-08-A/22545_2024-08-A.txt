Footnotes
KAGERO tracked the pace well back, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid outside the leader, and was carried widest into the stretch, then
made a steady gain, edged ahead and held. GOTHAM GRAY stalked the pace outside in the early going, tracked that one through the turn, bid outside
drifted out into the stretch, then made a steady gain and was outfinished. JAZZ TIME GIRL sprinted away from the field in the early going, held sway without
challenge to the final yards, then weakened and held the show. RIA FORMOSA broke a step slowly from the gate, saved ground through the turn, came
through inside into the stretch and closed for a share. OUTFACTORED well placed and outside, lost some ground three wide through the turn, bid on that
path into the stretch and ran evenly. MISS CLAUDETTE unhurried, looped three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, lugged in
and passed a tiring rival. MY BRIDGET VERDOT mid pack, lost ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch and had
no rally.

TEMPLET sprinted away from the field in the early going, held sway unchallenged to the late going, then drifted out late and lasted under steady pressure.
EL SOLITARIO unhurried, moved up while angling out through the second turn, came five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed
late kick. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT fractious in the gate, hopped at the start, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch,
made a steady gain, lost his path at the sixteenth pole, angled in and held the show. GIANT PAYDAY tracked the pace, angled out and moved up on the
two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. ORAZIO well placed and outside, gained
position three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong. BLUEBERRY ran evenly. TIZ TACT TOE was never
involved.

came four wide into the stretch, edged up for the show and held. YARDMAN unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch,
then could not gain the final furlong and held a share. LITTLE BIG mid pack, lost some ground two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into
the stretch and passed tiring rivals. ERLAN tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch and
faded late. LIGHT CRUISER steadily lost ground.
