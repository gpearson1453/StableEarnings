Footnotes
SAUCER EYES raced off the pace on the inside to the final turn then angled out to three wide at the quarter pole for a long drive to be up in the final jumps.
NATIVE REQUITE pressed the pace from two wide wile matching strides with CAJUN MISCHIEF to deep stretch while fighting gamely but was nipped at
the wire by the closing rival and had to settle for the place. CAJUN MISCHIEF went to the front to a pressured lead from the inside while matching strides
with NATIVE REQUITE to deep stretch but was outkicked by closing rival and gave the game effort. ZONG'S FAVOR was unhurried to the final turn then
angled out to three wide at the three furlong marker to take aim on the leaders, shifted back inside at the top of the stretch to make the rail bid but was no
match for the top three. BLUME was forwardly placed from two wide to the final turn and faded. STONECOAT was always back. A TRUE TARGET saved
ground to no avail.

Footnotes
UNCLE NICK was bumped on both sides by ROCKALL and GOBOT leaving the gate then was allowed to settle near the back down the backstretch, made
a three wide bid at the three furlong marker and took the lead at the top of the stretch but was challenged by GOBOT while matching strides to the wire and
won the nod. GOBOT broke outward and bumped UNCLE NICK leaving the gate then raced near the back around the first turn, moved up the rail down the
backstretch to vie for the lead on the inside around the final turn then engaged the leader at the quarter pole and match strides inside of UNCLE NICK to the
wire but was outnodded. RAUL'S ENCANTO rushed to the front to a challenged lead to the final turn then edged away to the top of the stretch where he
was collared and weakened. ROCKALL balked at entering the starting gate, broke in and bumped UNCLE NICK at the start then tracked the leaders from
the inside from the middle of the pack through the final turn and made a mild bid in the stretch to improve position. JIMMIE'S HALO was unhurried down the
backstretch, raced three wide around the final turn but was not a threat. STAR READY vied for the lead from three wide around the first turn then stalked the
pace from four wide down the backstretch, made a mild bid on the final turn but tired. CABRO TORO pressed the pace from two wide to the half mile marker
then faded to the three furlong marker and was done.

Footnotes
MY MAN FLINTSTONE prompted the pace from the inside to midway through the turn then drove past the leader to take the clear lead at the quarter pole
and won going away while keeping to task. STOMPING HOTROD was forwardly placed from three wide and made a late stretch run to finish strong.
FOREVER COOL was off a step slow then hustled along while advancing and was gaining late. GLENN'S JUMPER had good early speed to take the lead
to mid turn where he was engaged and tired. VERB chased the leaders but failed to menace. SUEZ raced near the back and was not a threat. DOUBLE
TRAP was void of speed and not a factor. ASPEN CLUB raced in the middle of the pace then bobbled midway through the turn, pulled up and was
transported on the equine ambulance.

Footnotes
MY GOLDEN BLING rushed to a challenged pace to the turn then inched away around the turn to take a clear lead into the stretch and was kept to task in
the drive. SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW was unsettled in the gate prior to the start then raced off the pace to the turn, moved up the rail around the turn but
flattened out to be second best. TEXAS RED BEL raced close up from four wide to the turn then tipped in to two wide through the turn and angled out to
three wide in upper stretch to make the late run to be up for show. NIGHT ORB vied for the lead from three wide to the turn then tipped in to race two wide
through the turn and tired in the stretch. TRIPLE L'S CUTTER raced near the back from the two path then angled out to four wide in upper stretch and gave
the late kick to improve her position. TAY TAY'S BABY was void of speed and passed tiring rivals. KITIARA raced near the back to the turn then made a
mild inside bid but failed to sustain the bid. HURRICANE TIZWAY broke well to press the pace from two wide to the half mile marker and faded. ZOOM
ERIN tracked the leaders from the middle of the pack then moved out to four wide at the three furlong marker but failed to menace.

inside then dueled down the stretch inside of PINKY RING BLING to the final yards and made a late surge to miss the win. PINKY RING BLING prompted
the early pace from two wide then dueled down the stretch outside of POMEROY HAZE to the final yards and gave way grudgingly. FOOLISH STEVE raced
close up from four wide on the backstretch then fell back on the turn but gave a late kick but only passed tired one. KID SHELLEEN raced close up from
three wide to midway through the turn and gave way.

went between horses at the sixteenth pole for the late rall to be up for show. AFLEET ASCENT raced off the pace from two wide through the turn, angled
out to three wide in upper stretch to make the late run but was outfinished by PUDDING who was closing late. ADIOS CARLOS raced in the middle of the
pack then made a mild bid on the turn and flattened out. COWBOY RIDGE broke well but dropped back quickly through the turn but gave a late kick to
improve his position. WESLEYAN broke out and bumped PUDDING leaving the gate, then was void of speed to the top of the stretch and passed tiring
