Footnotes
ROYAL BLUSH had an ideal trip, sitting alone behind the contesting duo along the backside, began to inch closer while in hand three wide with five
sixteenths from the line, went around foes easily to seize control in the five path by the quarter pole and under mild reminding at the sixteenth pole held
comfortably for the win. O WOW stalked near the rear in the beginning, picked up the bit, two wide starting to pass rivals at the three eighths pole, swung
out to the five path for the stretch run, chased the winner in vain home but continued to try, gaining on the winner at the finish line. WELL ACTUALLY dueled
outside up front down the backstretch, began to edge away from the early inside speed foe at the five sixteenths marker, offered no resistance to the winner
outside in mid-stretch and finished up mildly to stay on for the show money. KATHERINE'S GEM engaged on the rail for the lead down the backside, still
pressed the issue while on the fence in the turn, began to give way to the top two turning for home, briefly fought back in upper stretch but then faded at the
furlong marker to settle on the fringes in the end. HOLIDAY WITH AMY settled on the rail in mid-pack in the early stages, took closer order to be in range for
a piece of the prize three wide in upper stretch, could not find more down the lane, finishing up one paced to the wire. KEY STROKE trailed the field
throughout and could not factor in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
BREAK THE SPELL stalked on the rail in the back group in the early going, was nudged for more, shifting off the fence in midturn to be three wide, started
to gather more speed, swooped around rivals quickly by the quarter pole, drifted inwards when encouraged right-handed four wide in upper stretch taking
the lead and won going away at the wire. MY MUNNINGS MODEL was brushed on the start, tracked the front pair while nestled on the rail in the
backstretch, closed in on the fence with a quarter remaining, shifted out, off the tiring early leaders in the three path straightening out for the drive and
finished up besting the rest but was a distant second. CANADIAN AVRO broke out on the break, pressed the pace outside while in hand down the backside,
moved to the lead out for brief moment at the quarter pole, was no match for the winner who circled around foes in upper stretch and faded at the eighth
pole but easily held for third place. TREBUCHET tracked the lead duo while outside a rival in the backstretch, was roused between horses with two furlongs
to run, could not quicken with the winner who flew on past turning for home and finished up mildly in the lane for a minor role. PHANTOM JEWEL travelled
three deep outside rivals in the trail group, was roused three wide three furlongs out but had no response and finished up with good interest passing a
couple of rivals in the stretch. PONTIAC broke out on the start, settled in the rear pack between rivals, was scrubbed on in midturn, made little progression
around the bend and emptied out in the stretch drive. SILVER PISTOL had a slim advantage inside, pulling the rider to the lead along the backside, dueled
up top around the turn, was collared outside by the quarter pole, had no more to offer and stopped on the fence nearing the furlong marker.

Footnotes
MASON'S MUSIC sat behind the contested duo in the beginning, waited for the cue on the fence around the turn, started to quicken shifting out at the
quarter pole, bullied his way through runners in the four path turning for home and closed in strongly late, to just get up in the last jump for the victory.
GREAT KATE was under a tight hold while setting the pace inside down the backstretch, began to inch away for a clear lead by midturn, opened up in the
three path at mid-stretch but could not fend off the winner right at the finish line. SPIRIT BEAR was forced out on the break, prompted the pace outside
down the back straight, chased the frontrunner around the bend, was pushed out by the eventual winner to be in the five path at the top of the lane and
finished up with energy to settle for a clear but non threatening third in the end. I'M A BOURBON GIRL travelled outside foes in mid-pack, made little
headway under a vigorous ride throughout the turn and ran on willingly in the two path to the line to just get up at the wire for a minor share. BRAQUET was
allowed to settle down the backstretch to see the field entering the turn, started to rally, smartly picking up horses outside three wide midway on the turn,
angled out six widest with a chance for a share turning for home, could not sustain the run and stalled at the furlong marker. MITOLE POWER broke out on
the break, was unhurried to trail in the beginning, made an early move, improving four wide outside foes at the half, could not advance through the turn and
failed to menace in the drive to the wire. FLIP FLOPPIN FAST settled on the rail in midfield, was going the wrong way though coaxed for more around the
bend and could not offer a finish on the fence in the stretch running. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #7 SPIRIT BEAR AGAINST #4 MASONS MUSIC IN UPPER

Footnotes
VUCCHELLA attended the pace from outside pressing the leader, drew nearly even with that one nearing the five-sixteenths, was put to urging in upper
stretch with a short nose in front and now under urging, dueled till late stretch then edged away from the sparring partner and held from a fast-closing
SACCHARINE, who broke awkwardly, angled in and settled at the rear biding time just off the rail, moved out leaving the turn swinging six wide into upper
stretch, lugged out a bit in mid-stretch, rallied strongly from that point but just missed. QUALITY PRESENCE set a pressured pace inside the eventual
winner, dueled with that one fighting on gamely to retake a narrow advantage in mid-stretch but yielded grudgingly late. ROIKOP settled off the pace angling
in, saved ground on the turn, rode the rail into the stretch, ran on evenly and got the nod for the super. LEMON SWEETS rated in behind the leading pair
racing just off the fence and under a hold early, moved out a bit for the stretch run, needed more late. NANTUCKETS DAY settled at the rear outside, swung
seven wide turning for home, was forced out a path in mid-stretch, ran on. EMPIRE'S TREAT was off the pace racing two to three wide early and never near
enough to threaten.

Footnotes
SKYLIGHT CAPER broke out to begin, was quite content to watch the loose pacesetter along the backside, moved in measuring the leader at the quarter
pole, pounced to the lead with mild urging at the furlong marker and had more than enough to hold off the late surge from her stablemate. PERIWINKLE
reared at the break, was allowed to gather herself down the backside ahead of only the other poor starter, circled around runners five wide with a powerful
move at the quarter pole and finished up strongly to best the rest at the wire. SERIOUS GREEN travelled in midfield outside a rival, burst through between
runners two wide midpoint on the turn and finished determinedly up the fence in the drive to the wire to win the duel for the show award in deep stretch.
WELLNESS broke out on the start, was shuffled back three wide outside runners at the half, commenced a rally four wide circling foes with five sixteenths to
go to be in the hunt while in the four path turning for home but lost the battle for third money late. ORIENT BEACH was checked at the start to trail the field
by many down the backstretch, closed the gap on the pack through the turn and showed some good late energy to pass a few runners down the stretch. MY
CASH FACTOR veered out on the break, tracked outside in the early going, was scrubbed on, three wide between rivals midway on the turn, could not keep
up with others by the quarter pole and retreated in upper stretch. MISS MITOLE darted away from the field down the back straight, continued to freewheel it
on the front end around the turn, was collared outside by the winner in upper stretch, had little left to the wire and yielded at the furlong marker. CLOSING
APPEAL was away slowly to begin, settled in mid-division on the rail along the backside, had to be checked when coming up on runners at the seven
sixteenths pole, was then steadied on the fence nearing the quarter pole and could not recover to play a role in the stretch running.

Footnotes
GOLDEN CANARY settled mid-division inside, shifted out coming to the three-eighths in range of the leaders, was six wide past the five-sixteenths, bid at
the quarter pole, drew clear and was kept to the task. BOLT ENOREE shifted in settling mid-pack, saved ground early on the turn, was guided out late on
that bend angling seven wide into upper stretch and under stout urging, drifted in through the stretch, was second best. GOOD AS GONE was prominent
very early then taken back off the leading pair while shifting in, tracked inside the second flight, cut the corner and advanced inside foes in upper- to
mid-stretch, held show honors. CRY FREEDOM broke a step slowly, lacked early speed despite moderate coaxing, then settled into stride at the back off
the inside, swung six wide into upper stretch, kicked on mildly but needed more. BRAVO KATE settled at the back off the inside, was mostly four to five wide
on the turn and into upper stretch, ran on. YOU BE THE JUDGE set a pressured pace from off the rail, weakened. ONELLA attended then pressed the pace
from outside, weakened. PRINCESS MAYFAIR stalked from between foes in the second flight, was ridden by the three-eighths but offered no late response.
PERFECT LADY BEE was at the back off the inside, encouraged along nearing the seven-sixteenths, failed to menace. THE NIIGON FACTOR was
reluctant to load, stalked close up outside the second flight four to five wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
STORMS OF LIFE was allowed to settle at the back into the first turn, galloped along finding her stride trailing the field down the back straight, began to
reach for ground smartly going by rivals at the quarter pole, shifted out five wide for clear run at the top of the lane and under a well timed late run got up for
the win in the shadow of the wire outside. ENGLISH JUBILEE settled near the rear just outside horses in the first turn, started to mount a rally going through
rivals at the half, waited for a seam with a quarter mile to run, shifted inwards to the rail by upper stretch, angled out three wide taking control at the
sixteenth pole but could not fend off the surging winner outside in deep stretch. JUST MAGNIFICENT broke in, bumping rival on the break, contested the
lead on the rail in the first turn, patiently llet the frontrunner go ahead down the backstretch, rebid outside by the quarter pole, briefly poked her head in front
between runners with a furlong remaining, was no match for the top two late but did stay on gamely for third money. SILENT AND SINFUL tracked on the
fence in the second flight in the early stages, kept pace when roused through the far turn and finished up evenly to the wire to be a fringe player in the end.
PRINCESSONAMISSION pressed the pace issue outside into the first turn, opened up on the field along the backside, was headed outside by the quarter
pole, was just clinging to the lead on the fence with an eighth to go and faded in deep stretch. VRANA (IRE) stalked in the third flight outside down the
backstretch, chased the front pair, two wide outside rivals in the far turn, in the four path was in the hunt straightening for home but could not continue the
rally and faltered at the furlong marker. DUVAL STREET travelled in mid-pack outside a runner, rallied four wide outside rivals with three furlongs to go
taking closer order, was in range in the four path turning for home but weakened with a furlong left to run. GOOD NEWS MONEY broke out, bumping foe on
the start, was ahead of one rival down the backside, could see the field when stuck behind a tiring horses on the fence at the quarter pole and could not
factor in the drive to the wire. SCAT HUMOR settled on the rail in mid-division in the early stages, had no more to offer when roused on the rail in the final
bend and tired on the fence at the quarter pole. PRINCESS JADE travelled four wide near the rear in the first turn, made no impression three deep along the
backside, had little to give four wide outside foes on the far turn and failed to get into contention down the lane.

Footnotes
LOON CRY exchanged a light bump at the start, settled toward the rear off the inside, fanned seven wide into upper stretch beginning to rally, struck the
lead near the eighth pole, drifted in at that juncture while drawing clear, held. BLIND SPOT exchanged minor contact at the start, settled mid-pack near the
inside, saved ground on the turn, rallied up the rail in the stretch but was only second best. QUEEN MACHA broke outwardly, settled at the back near the
inside, began to shift out late on the turn coming into upper stretch five wide, altered out further in mid-stretch and finished with late interest. GASTOWN
BABE settled off the pace outside toward the back, was between foes fanning six wide turning for home, rallied in tandem with but just in behind the
eventual winner, was carried inward by that one in mid-stretch, bumped a rival lightly near the sixteenth pole and ran on. MISS VYVYANNE was urged clear
in the early going, set the pace shifting nearer the inside, drifted out a bit in mid-stretch when challenged and weakened. VERDEJO lacked early speed, was
encouraged along near the five-sixteenths bringing up the rear, swung seven deep turning for home, finished with late interest. STAR CANDY broke
outwardly, settled at the back outside, was four to five wide into the turn, eased back and shifted in near the seven-sixteenths, saved ground the rest of the
bend, gained on the leaders along the rail in upper- to mid-stretch but lacked room late. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE stalked from outside, went four to five wide
on the turn and in range turning into upper stretch, drifted in a bit and was carried in a bit further, bumped near the sixteenth pole and tapped on the brakes.
PANAMA RED (IRE) stalked outside a rival three wide heading into the turn, came into upper stretch four wide but faltered and faded. I'M INTO MISCHIEF
broke on top but settled into stride off the leader having switched out off the fence, stalked from inside a foe but in the two path, faltered and faded.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF GASTOWN BABE AGAINST LOON CRY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE,
NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

TALK TO YA LATER was unhurried to co-trail on the inside down the back straight, shifted just outside to commence a run in midturn, circled three wide
around horses at the quarter pole, loomed to only threat driving to the wire while in the three path and went on by in the final seventy yards for the score.
STRIKE A CHORD broke in at the start, pressed the pace on the rail early on, took over the lead inside at the half, opened up when disposing of the early
speed foe turning for home, began to get leg weary at the furlong marker, could not hold off the charging winner outside but did stay on the best others at
the wire. EMPTY GESTURE tracked the lead pair travelling outside horses down the backstretch, improved position with a mild run at the quarter pole three
wide and fought down the lane for the show award to edge away late for that prize. OLYMPIC FENCER was bumped outside on the break, tracked the
engaged duo down the backside, kept pace with rivals when urged for more midturn on the fence, dueled for third place running inside to the wire but faded
late and settled on the fringes. NOVEL co-trailed on the outside down the backstretch, offered a mild run three wide on the outside at the seven sixteenths
marker, made little impact still three wide around the bend, shifted out more to be four wide for the drive but had little finish to offer in the stretch. MAXIMUM
FIFTY had the lead after the break, was relegated to a chasing role on the outside through the turn, began to shorten stride in the two path by upper stretch
and wilted on the fence at the furlong marker. MINEDANDREFINED stalked near the rear in the beginning, was steadied sharply between foes nearing the
three-furlong pole losing all momentum and could not recover to be involved in the stretch running.

Footnotes
COZY CURLIN KITTEN was content on the fence, ahead of only one runner in the first turn, co-trailed on the inside at the half mile marker, rallied two wide
between foes with five sixteenths from home, pushed her way out finding room in the five-path straightening for the drive and under a hand ride down the
stretch won easily, going away when crossing the finish line. NIKITA'S GEM settled outside a runner near the back of the pack along the backside, had a
quick turn of foot when asked, swooping three wide around foes with five sixteenths to go, was moving well in the four path at the top of the stretch, finished
up strongly but was no contest against the winner by mid-stretch and ran on to the end to clearly be second best against this field. PEGGY was unhurried in
last into the first turn, co-trailed on the outside at the half, circled around rivals three wide midway on the far turn, was forced out when brushed by the
winner inside turning for home and stubbornly fought on to close and capture third money at the wire. KID GIZMO stalked on the rail near the rear in the
backstretch, was shuffled to last while on the fence at the quarter pole, and finished with purpose, finding a seam in the three path in the last furlong, closing
smartly to just miss getting the nod for the show award at the wire. GATHER tracked on the fence into the first turn, by the half, was by herself watching the
embattled pair, edged closer to the leaders around the far turn, bid for the lead in the two path in upper stretch, seized command briefly at the eighth pole
but could not continue the run and faded with seventy yards from the wire. SHAMELESS AFFAIR had a stalking role, all alone in the third flight, started to
rally, passing rivals two wide outside with three furlongs to go, could not maintain position in the three path with outside horses closing, shifted inwards to
the two path straightening out for the wire but had no finish to offer down the lane. TIANMA took command from the start on the fence, set a quick pace
while pressured outside down the backstretch, opened up mildly on the rail turning for home when disposing of the early pace foe, had little left in the tank
though and emptied out at the furlong marker inside of rivals. BLACKDIAMOND DINNY hounded the pace from the start, continued to shadow the leader
down the backside, had nothing more to offer three wide at the top of the lane and backed away with runners on either side at the furlong pole. RED MOOD
tracked three wide outside a runner in the early stages, was roused on the fence but could not go with others making a move outside midway on the far turn
and never factored in the stretch drive. RIDERS AND TRAINERS CLAIM OF FOUL #8 PEGGY AGAINST #1 COZY CURLIN KITTEN IN UPPER STRETCH
