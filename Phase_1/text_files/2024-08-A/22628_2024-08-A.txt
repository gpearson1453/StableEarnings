Footnotes
TAHINI bumped outer rival at the start, coaxed between rivals then chased out of range, came off the rail briefly on the then moved back inside and drew
closer on the turn, steered out in upper stretch, challenged past the eighth pole, took over a sixteenth out and drove clear. JUDICIOUS bumped by TAHINI
in the beginning, stalked three deep, moved into the two path quickly early on the turn, bid from outside past the five-sixteenths pole, kept the pressure on to
midstretch, was no match for the winner in the late stages but got by CYPRUS MOON to reclaim second. CYPRUS MOON away quickest to take the front,
controlled the pace and moved inside, challenged by JUDICIOUS on the turn, resisted to midstretch, then yielded to the winner at the sixteenth pole and
could not hold on for second. RUNAWAY KITTEN dropped back early, saved ground through the turn, tipped out into the lane and improved position.
TIZNOW MAMA stalked between then outside a rival into the turn, drifted out between the three-eighths pole and five-sixteenths marker, was guided back
inward and could not rally in the lane. THANK YOU KERA stalked pacesetter from inside, lugged out at the quarter pole and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
NO MORE DING DONGS away quickly then ceded command and pressed the pace inside a trio of rivals, took over with three furlongs remaining and
dueled around the turn, shook free in upper stretch, then drew off when urged once with the left handed crop midstretch and was ridden out in the final
sixteenth. SMOKEM IF U GOTTEM set the pace under pressure from both sides, lost command at the three-eighths pole and fought back on even terms
around the bend, yielded to the winner in upper stretch and stayed on to hold second. OMNIFICENT broke a step slow, chased outside a rival, steered out
around the bend and entered the lane five wide and gained the show honors. DANZING WILD CAT attended the pace four deep to the turn, vied three deep
around the bend, could not keep up with the top pair at the top of the lane and weakened in the furlong grounds. KISS FOR LULU chased the top quartet
from inside into the turn, saved ground around the bend, asked right-handed at the three-sixteenths marker and weakened. CAUGHT IN THE DARK
pressed the pace three deep to the turn, dropped back around the bend, moved into the two path and tired. BRUNCHANDCRUNCH came away slow,
veered in shortly after, hit the temporary rail and unseated the rider, was caught quickly by the outrider and walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING BRUNCHANDCRUNCH EARLY IN THE RACE AND RULED THAT HE CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS AND
THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
GETAWAY CAR cleared the field and crossed over to control the pace in the two path, moved over to the rail and was coaxed along on the turn, continued
clear under light handling into the final furlong and widened while coasting through the last sixteenth. MISCHIEF RIVER chased the speed from outside then
alongside WHITE SANDS into the turn, got brushed by that rival at the three-eighths pole, continued in pursuit a bit off the rail into the lane, followed the
winner within striking distance to the eighth pole, could not offer the needed the response to threaten late but stayed on to secure second. WHITE SANDS
stalked GETAWAY CAR along the inside into the turn, started to climb and drifted out to brush MISCHIEF RIVER at the three-eighths pole, chased two wide
into the lane and kept on for a clear third. TIZ HAPPY broke well and was hustled early, started to climb and was guided to the outside, trailed three then
four wide around the bend, had little left for the stretch run and was not persevered with in the late stages.

Footnotes
OMAHA GIRL cleared and moved into the two path, started to pull first time through the stretch while moving to the rail, led under a hold on the first turn,
lost command past the five-eighths pole, was closet in pursuit out of range up the backstretch, moved to within striking distance on the far turn, took over in
upper stretch, cleared at the eighth pole and held in the closing moments. ROYAL CHARTER (GB) hard to load behind the gate, unhurried in the beginning
and steadied briefly when losing a clear path, pulled along the inside, came off the rail on the far turn spun three wide into the lane, moved out further and
finished well from outside to get up for second. YERWANTHERE (IRE) raced near the back on the inside, gained through the far turn, angled out and got
hemmed in upper stretch, moved inward to a clear path, finished determinedly but got edged by ROYAL CHARTER (GB) for second. KITTY KITANA (GB)
forwardly placed in hand from the two path early, chased out of range up the backstretch, moved closer two then three wide on the second bend, launched a
bid in upper stretch and got outkicked by the top trio. PARIS SECRET (IRE) antsy in the gate, hopped at the star to come away last, tucked inside at the
back, went outside a rival into the backstretch, trailed on the inside entering the lane, moved off the fence and improved position. SPEED LANE stalked
three deep early then started to pull first time in the stretch, tugged again into the backstretch, fell back off the pace in the middle stages, went two, three,
then four wide on the far turn and could not rally. TEA N CONVERSATION stalked between rivals then got bumped and became rank entering the lane for
the first time, took another bump from inner rival shortly after, sat well off the pace in the two path, spun three wide into the lane and was not a factor. REAL
FIRE pulled along the inside and bumped outer rival leaving the chute, bumped that rival again first time through the stretch, tugged along on the clubhouse
turn, was let loose early on the backstretch and went up to clear past the five-eighths pole, opened up a comfortable lead in the middle stages, held a
diminished lead into the lane, lost command and drifted in to bother GETTHEMONEY in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. GETTHEMONEY
antsy in the gate, rated along the inside then traveled in mid-pack on the backstretch, moved into range on the far turn, got put in tight along the fence and
checked in upper stretch and was not persevered with after.

Footnotes
HOT GIRL WALK broke a step slow, chased for a bit then went up to force the pace from outside, dueled around the bend and cleared past the quarter
pole, drew away in upper stretch and was kept busy to the line. LIL' BOOM BOOM chased along the rail, tipped out into the stretch, finished determinedly
but could not reach the winner and held second. OM N JOY broke a step slow, raced at the back inside a trio of rivals, hugged the rail and cut the corner
into the stretch, summoned a mild rally next to the fence and gained third. PAVEL'S ETOILE tracked three deep into the turn, continued three wide into the
lane and needed to find more late. RIZZLEBERRY ROSE off a step slow in the beginning, moved closer between rivals, climbed and lost ground on the
turn, spun four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. RENATUS broke a step slow, chased three deep at the back, pushed on through the turn, came five
wide into the lane and failed to menace. AMELIA'S ECHO climbed early and dropped back, raced outside a rival then became a bit rank into the turn,
chased two wide into the drive and passed tired rivals. GOBERNADORA ELY away quickest and was forwardly placed under coaxing early, lost ground two
wide around the bend and faded in the lane. STANFORD HOTTIE sent for the lead and cleared briefly before taking pressure from the winner, fought back
from inside to the quarter pole, could not keep up late on the bend and gave way. PRIZECONQUEST chased four deep at the rear early, remained wide
through the turn, spun five wide into the lane and could not make an impact.

DURAN trailed early and moved inside, went between rivals into the far turn, boxed briefly and altered out into the clear at the five-sixteenths pole, came
four wide into the stretch, closed well from outside, drew alongside SIR MAXIMUS at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. SIR MAXIMUS took control from
inside, set all the pace to the stretch, remained unchallenged into the final furlong, confronted by DURAN in the final sixteenth, yielded late and saved
second. EMPIRE'S CLASSIC stalked the speed along the fence, waited for room continuing to save ground on the far turn, roused at the top of the lane,
tipped off the fence, finished gamely between late and missed second. ONE TIME MARK brushed with outer rival three wide into the first turn, taken in hand
and moved to the two path, got boxed in between rivals on the far turn, lacked room in traffic in the lane, moved out and kept on for a minor award. BOUND
TO SUCCEED raced a bit off the rail then along the rail near the back, crept closer from the fence on the far turn, found traffic into the lane and needed to
find more once gaining a clear path. IN SUSPENSE rated in the two path, took aim two wide leaving the far turn but weakened down the lane. MONGOLIAN
MAX settled outside a rival near toward the rear, traveled three deep in the middle stages, ran up on heels into the far turn, trailed off the rail into the stretch
and was not a factor. STORM OFF broke out, pulled early then brushed with inner rival four wide early on the clubhouse turn, stalked three deep into the
backstretch, remained three wide to the stretch, shifted out at the eighth pole and weakened.

Footnotes
GAMING coaxed from the gate and went up to set a pressure pace inside a trio of rivals, disposed of ARRAKIS approaching the quarter pole, then. RANK
tracked the early speed outside a pair of rivals, went three then four wide around the turn, could not make any headway on the winner in the stretch run but
stayed on to best the rest. BROTHER TONY broke a bit slow, ducked in shortly after and had the rider take hold, trailed then had once rival beat up the
backstretch, traveled off the rail then angled in early on the turn, tipped back out to the two path around the bend and was along for the show. ARRAKIS
pressed the pace from between rivals, kept the pressure on GAMING to the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up with a quarter mile left to run, chased
two wide into the drive and weakened. SOI NGERN attended the pace four deep in the early going, chased four wide into the turn, moved into the two path
then came back out and exited the bend four wide, then weakened down the lane. AUTHENTIC SPIRIT pressed three deep between rivals, chased the
leaders three wide into the turn, angled down to the rail and faded in the lane. POOR CONNECTION stumbled leaving the gate, dropped back and trailed off
the inside, took the turn thee then four wide and was not a factor. FARLEY HALL stalked inside pair of rivals, dropped back next to the rail on the turn and
came up empty. BINGING stalked between in range to the turn, lost ground while easing out around the bend, came five wide into the lane, tired and eased
in the final furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
ANTIFONA (FR) got crowded a bit shortly after the start, trailed early in the two path then raced outside a rival, tugged a bit and moved closer in the middle
stages, angled out on the far turn chased four deep at the quarter pole, took aim three wide into the lane, rallied between in upper stretch, dueled inside
ESPRIT ENCHANTE in the final furlong and dug in to edge the runner-up. ESPRIT ENCHANTE broke a step slow on the outside, sat off the pace in the two
path, closed the gap in the middle stages, chased four deep at the quarter pole, bid outside the leader leaving the bend and took over, cleared briefly in
upper stretch but was soon challenged by ANTIFONA (FR), dueled outside that rival through the late stages and yielded grudgingly in the end. SHE IS
ROMANTIC traveled near the back next to the rail then raced at the back inside ANTIFONA (FR), drew closer on the backstretch, had to pause in traffic on
the far turn, tipped out into the clear and gained third. INVINCIBLE MOLLY (GB) vied inside a pair of rivals for command to the far turn, drifted out and
bumped early on the bend, cleared at the five-sixteenths marker, overtaken into the stretch and flattened to fourth. LAMPORGHINI settled off the top trio on
the inside, moved into striking distance on the backstretch, had to pause behind the leader when boxed in at the quarter pole, roused leaving the bend,
moved out in the lane and weakened. FALABELLA vied between rivals, got bumped into outer rival past the three-eighths pole, lost contact with the leader
midway around the bend and tired in the lane. ANTIQUE SILVER vied three deep to the far turn, took a bump from inner rival early on the bend, chased
past the five-sixteenths pole and also tired.

by MAN OVERBOARD in the final sixteenth and yielded. I'M A LUCKY MAN vied six then five rivals deep in the early going, lost contact with the leader earl
on the turn, re-bid from outside into the lane, was turned away at the eighth pole and kept on to secure the show honors. BAG'S GOLD broke well then
dropped back off the pace, went three wide into the turn, angled seven wide around the bend, offered a mild response when called on but could not get by

Footnotes
DEALERS SPECIAL tracked out of range in the two path, moved closer in the middle stages, waited on the far turn then tipped out into the clear a quarter
mile out, bid three wide leaving the far turn, took over at the eighth pole, put MIDDLEBURG away at the sixteenth pole, then had to contend with
ROSTOVSKY late and was able to hold on. ROSTOVSKY allowed to settle near the back and moved into the two path, drew closer on the backstretch,
ridden along while gaining on the turn, angled out for a clear run in the lane, rallied in deep stretch, drew alongside DEALERS SPECIAL and just missed.
MIDDLEBURG away quickly then ceded command to outer rivals and rated along the inside, tipped out and bid two wide at the five-sixteenths pole, took
over at the quarter pole, cleared briefly but was soon challenged by DEALERS SPECIAL late on the bend, dueled in upper stretch before losing command
at the eighth pole and flattened to third. GOODFELLA (IRE) traveled along the fence towards the rear, went outside a rival on the backstretch, gained
ground while easing over to the three path on the far turn, kept trying through the lane but needed to find more late. DIVISIBLE BY broke a step slow from
inside and was unhurried after, raced outside a rival into the far turn, raced in the three path turning for home, moved inward in the lane and offered a mild
response to improve position. CRAZY CAVALIER got knocked around and lost his path at the start, trailed two wide then moved to the rail first time through
the stretch, saved ground around both turns, angled out at the top of the lane, ran into traffic in upper stretch and improve placings after moving to a clear
path. ANGLICAN broke out and bumped GLANDFORD (GB) and kicked AMERICAN ONLY in the right-hind leg shortly after, chased from off the pace two
wide then moved to the rail, saved ground through both turns, tipped two wide into the lane, lost his path in upper stretch and failed to threaten.
GLANDFORD (GB) got bumped on both sides and lost his path at the start, was taken to the inside then began to pull early, had the saddle slip forward, got
blocked behind a weakening rival and had to check hard past the quarter pole and was not persevered with in the lane. TRACK AND FIELD broke in and
bumped CRAZY CAVALIER, dueled from outside early then stalked in the two path around the clubhouse turn, remained close to the far turn, asked right
handed past the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane and weakened. AMERICAN ONLY broke out and got kicked by ANGLICAN in the right-hind leg
at the start, went up to duel from inside, took control and cleared around the clubhouse turn, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged by outer rival at
the five-sixteenths pole, lost command with a quarter mile remaining, started to weaken entering the lane, tired and eased in the final furlong and walked off.
