entering the stretch and gained ground late up the rail. HALF BROTHER raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the second bend, drifted out in midstretch, bumping with DRAMA CHORUS, and kept on to the wire from there. GOLDEN
