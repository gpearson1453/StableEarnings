MUSICAL RIDE forced the early pace, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. FRERET settled
of the early leaders, had a mild gain on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch just missed. CRUMLIN BIRD was in touch, roused on the turn
and had a bid from the five path in mid stretch but was outfinished. DEVIL IN HER HEART was unhurried early, trailed the field on the turn and from the
seven path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. EASY ACCESS set a pressured pace but chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
SEA TO AIR broke awkwardly, took command on the turn and was kept to task through the stretch. BIG TIME LOUIE was in touch, a factor on the turn and
from the three path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. BOCELLI was well back, had a mild gain on the turn and was up for show. BEYOND
MY DREAMS was unhurried early, saved ground on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch passed tired foes. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN was
in range and had a good position on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. HEADING WEST was away alertly but lost ground
on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch had nothing left.

Footnotes
KIDDIE HOLIDAY showed speed from the inside, had a slim lead on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win.
HICKSY was away alertly, dueled on the turn and vied from the six path at the top of the stretch but was second best. SCAT FACTOR settled off the pace,
had a mild gain on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch rallied late. MAGIC TOMAHAWK stumbled at the start, trailed the field on the
turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. FOUR ACES HIGH stalked the early leaders and was a factor on the turn but from the eight
path at the top of the stretch weakened. PRINCESS ALESKA was in range and raced evenly on the turn but dropped back through the stretch.
