DEAR SANTA quick to begin crossed over to set the early pace, cleared off near the eighth pole and prevailed late under strong handling. EFF THIRTY
FIVE was bumped at the start, made a good rail bid in the drive and just missed. DRUNKEN SAILOR stalked the pace, saved ground past the quarter pole,
raced three deep through the stretch drive and finished gamely to the wire. BIG BOYS ANSWER was forwardly placed early on, raced three wide around
both turns and had not enough late. CASTAGNO was allowed to settle early, raced two to three wide in the stretch and needed more. SILK WAR dropped
back to race with the second flight early, ridden along nearing the three eighths pole, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and lacked a rally.
SACHMO settled off the early going, raced five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a response. TROPANDHAGEN broke in, bumped with rival at the
start, tracked the early leader two deep from the outside and faded. GALILEE was bumped at the start, forced to take up soon after the start, trailed early on
and lacked a solid bid. SIREN failed to sustain a bid.

SMOKE WAGON settled off the early dueling pair to trail, hard ridden into the far turn, was four deep through the turn and just got up under strong handling.
REBEL INVASION dueled for the early lead just to the outside of rival, cleared off near the five sixteenths pole, remained clear inside the eighth pole and
was wore down late to get caught near the wire in a game effort. ONEOFTHEGOODGUYS was allowed to settle back off the early duel, moved up three
wide into the upper stretch, took aim into the upper lane and kept on gamely to the wire. STRIDER'S SLIDER dueled near the rail and faded. PROM
KNIGHT was off slowly, under a hard chase near the inside and stopped.

PRATT rated along to race in hand early, made a three wide bid near the quarter pole and edged up late under strong handling. ELVIRUS set his own
uncontested pace, felt pressure into the far turn, cleared back off under mild urging, led deep stretch and missed in a game effort. BARLEEWON tracked the
early leader two deep and weakened through the drive. KODAPENDENT broke to the outside, settled early on, raced four to six wide around the far turn
and raced evenly in the drive with not enough. A T M AWESOME stalked the pace two deep and faded. SIR SAHIB was allowed to settle early, raced three
wide between near the quarter pole and had no response. HANG TIGHT lost ground, raced far back, eased up on and walked off.

RAPID RESPONSE sent along to battle early for the early lead, taken back a bit to prompt the top pair from the outside and finished strongly in the drive to
edge clear under steady pressure. BOSS HOLIDAY dueled for the early lead two deep, dug in near the eighth pole but was no match for the winner late.
ROCKIN THE PALACE was under a hard chase early, raced five wide into the upper stretch to take aim and flattened out. TWIXTER dropped back early to
race mid pack, swung six wide into the lane and had not enough. MIGHTY MINION void of early speed to trail, raced four wide deep near the three
sixteenths pole and needed more. KHAKI JACK stalked the pace, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and tired. CONNECTING raced seven wide
into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. WICKED IRISHMAN dueled early on near the rail and gave way.

RAW POWER was off slowly, settled to race near the back early, made a three wide move near the quarter pole and just edged up late under strong
handling. REZQUIA stalked the pace, raced thee deep between rivals near the three sixteenths pole, dug in and missed in a game effort. MUCHO MACHO
MRYTLE pressed two deep from the outside, led narrowly near the eighth pole and weakened in the latter stages. NANASQUAN raced four wide around
both turns and moved up mildly through the drive. MAKE A SPLASH stalked the pace along the inside and tired. LET'S GO MO raced six to seven wide into
the upper stretch and never threatened. FACE IT ALONE set a pressured early pace from the inside and stopped.
