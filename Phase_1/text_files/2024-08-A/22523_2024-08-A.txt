Footnotes
LIBERTY WOLF hustled away from the start, raced close up to the early pace and got caught in tight approaching the first turn, checked off of heels at the
six-furlong marker, settled into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace from the inside heading to the half-mile pole, saved ground into the far
turn, got caught a bit in tight nearing the quarter pole and angled four to five wide into the stretch, responded to urging and bid between rivals nearing the
furlong grounds, took command at mid-stretch and battled RED RAJ into the final sixteenth, drifted out under firm urging in deep stretch and lasted for the
win at the finish. RED RAJ was prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace outside of BEAU BRUME and went three wide into the backstretch
run, stalked the moderate pace three wide approaching the half-mile, was well placed into the far turn and chased three wide heading to the quarter marker,
raced widest into the stretch and rallied five to six wide at the furlong marker, battled LIBERTY WOLF into the final sixteenth, was crowded by that rival into
deep stretch and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. BEAU BRUME sent leaving the start, assumed early command and set the pace while off of
the rail entering the first turn, ceded the lead into the backstretch run and prompted UPDRAFT through moderate fractions heading to the half-mile marker,
pressured that rival into the far turn, took the lead into upper stretch, was overtaken at the furlong marker, could not match strides with the top pair into the
final sixteenth and held for third at the finish. MISCHIEF'S THIRSTY hit the gate leaving the start and was away a bit slowly, was allowed to settle in the
early running and went two to three wide into the first turn, was content to trail through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn, advanced into
upper stretch, finished evenly into the final furlong and missed for third. CANTILEVER settled off of the early pace while never far back, tracked the
moderate pace four wide into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and tracked the pace while widest nearing the half-mile, chased four
wide into the far turn and gained ground at the quarter, could not sustain that run into the stretch and weakened in the drive. UPDRAFT raced close up to
the early pace, saved ground into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and assumed command nearing the half-mile, set the pace into the
far turn, was overtaken into upper stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and faded in the late stages. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed
using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
RIOLO broke in a bit at the start and bothered a neighboring rival, tracked the moderate early pace from the second flight, was guided two to three wide into
the turn, angled four wide for the stretch drive and loomed at the furlong marker, made a sustained rally into the final sixteenth, responded to urging in deep
stretch and got up in the final strides for a determined win. NO D'ORO showed good early speed and was prominent leaving the start, stalked the moderate
early pace outside of SIX HOT GRANDS, attended to the pace two wide into the turn, vied between rivals into upper stretch, battled MONSIEUR past the
furlong marker, fought gamely into the final sixteenth and just missed for the win, while just earning the nod for second. MONSIEUR broke alertly, ceded the
early lead to SIX HOT GRANDS and tracked the moderate early pace from the outside, was well placed into the turn and stalked the leading pair three wide
approaching the quarter pole, roused into the stretch, took a narrow lead at the furlong marker and battled into the final sixteenth, fought gamely while
between rivals into deep stretch and just missed for the win and place, while clear of the rest for the show honors. BEAUTY IN AUTISM hustled to be
forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the moderate early pace while saving ground and was well placed into the turn, chased the pace heading to the
quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch, was able to mildly re-rally into the final sixteenth but needed more in the late stages. SIX HOT GRANDS was
hard sent leaving the start, assumed early command and set a moderate pace heading to the half-mile marker, extended the lead into the turn and dictated
terms nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken into upper stretch, chased the leaders approaching the furlong grounds and faded in the final sixteenth. EL
BEARIN allowed to settle in the early running, raced outside of rivals into the turn and went three to four wide approaching the quarter marker, ran evenly to
mid-stretch and did not threaten in the late stages. SCIENCE RULES was squeezed leaving the start, broke slowly and was void of early speed, lost contact
with the rest along the turn and did not factor.

Footnotes
ST BOADIN broke well, dueled with BOBBY ANTON from the five furlong marker, took command after passing the three furlong pole, drifted out passing the
three-sixteenths marker but held clear under steady handling to the wire. BOBBED N LURED broke best but was outgunned for the lead, tracked just behind
the dueling leaders and angled over to the two path when clear, was already under a driver from the half-mile marker, got to the inside through the turn but
became boxed in for a half-furlong, got clear, was kept to task and finished well enough to gain the place in the final yards. BOBBY ANTON broke a beat
slow but rushed up to the lead, joined by ST BOADIN at the five furlong pole, dueled to the three eighths marker then was unable to go on with that one,
switched to the outside at the head of the stretch then lugged in sharply then tipped out to the three path still on the left lead, narrowly avoided clipping heels
with the eventual winner at the furlong pole, kept on under handling but could not find the needed response. DUNGARVAN OAK raced inside and tracked in
mid-pack through the early stages, advanced into contention going into the turn then was boxed in along the rail to the five-sixteenths pole, swung out a
path into the clear at the top of the stretch and finished evenly. HYDROPLANE tracked three wide behind the pace, made a mid-race move into contention
through the turn, loomed a threat at the top of the stretch but had trouble changing leads, lost some momentum in mid-stretch and was unable to improve.
APPLE WARRIOR was last away and quickly trailed well behind the field, was under a drive on the turn could not make any improvement and was pulled up
at the eighth pole, was transported off of the track via equine ambulance. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to
arrive at the most accurate time. THE RIDER OF BOBBY ANTON LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF ST BOADIN FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED THAT OBJECTION AND NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH WAS MADE.

Footnotes
PINEAPPLE CRUISE sent to establish the early lead, assumed command and set a solid pace heading to the half-mile marker, was well handled into the
turn and drew to a clear lead at the quarter marker while off of the rail, widened into the stretch, was kept to task to the sixteenth marker and was hand
urged into deep stretch to prevail as much the best. LOCHMARA tracked the solid early pace from the outside, ran in pursuit three then four wide along the
turn, could not match strides with the winner into upper stretch, offered a mild late bid and outfinished RIVER OF AMBITION to earn the place honors.
RIVER OF AMBITION forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the solid early pace from the inside, took back to track the pace approaching the
half-mile and saved ground into the turn, maintained an inside path into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, needed more into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished for second, while holding safely in the end for third. HARBOR DEAREST stalked the solid early pace from between runners,
chased PINEAPPLE CRUISE into the turn and ran in pursuit three wide nearing the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and weakened in the final
furlong. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ANITANEWMERCEDES broke alertly, ceded the early lead then got caught in tight approaching the first turn, checked off of heels at the six-furlong marker,
recovered and tracked the pace from the inside into the backstretch run, was well placed while saving ground heading to the half-mile marker, chased two
wide nearing the quarter pole, angled three wide into upper stretch and was set down for the drive, took command heading to the furlong grounds, dug in
while kept to task into the final sixteenth, felt pressure from the oncoming runner-up and determinedly held for the win in the final strides. HONOS MAN was
allowed to settle leaving the start, raced two wide into the first turn and was unhurried while not far back into the backstretch run, chased two wide into the
far turn, swung four wide for the stretch drive and rallied at the furlong marker, responded to urging and closed well into the final sixteenth, surged in deep
stretch and missed for the win, while clear of the rest for second. CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN was unhurried away from the start, saved ground into the first
turn and was content to trail into the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the far turn, tipped three wide into the stretch and rallied at the furlong
marker, could not match strides with the leading pair into the final sixteenth and stayed on in deep stretch to earn the show honors. ROBIE sent leaving the
start, assumed early command and cleared to the rail entering the first turn, set a prompted pace into the backstretch run and carved out modest fractions
heading to the half-mile marker, showed the way into the second turn, was overtaken into upper stretch, chased into the final sixteenth and faded in deep
stretch. MOTHER'S PRAYER prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace outside of ROBIE into the first turn, attended to the modest pace
through the backstretch run, pressed ROBIE into the far turn and vied between rivals at the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and weakened in
the final furlong. LET THETRUTHBETOLD broke a bit awkwardly at the start and was away a step slowly, recovered to track the early pace three wide into
the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and stalked the modest pace from the outside heading to the half-mile pole, chased three then four
wide nearing the quarter marker, lugged out into upper stretch then was a bit erratic and shied from the crop approaching mid-stretch, was outrun past the
furlong marker and was not persevered with in the late stages. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the
most accurate time.

Footnotes
SEA DOG hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set the pace into the first turn, dictated terms into the backstretch run and set a decent
pace heading to the half-mile marker, showed the way into the far turn and led to the quarter marker while a bit off of the rail, drifted out while clear into
upper stretch, extended the lead at the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and held sway in the late stages. RULER OF ANGELS broke
a step slowly and was allowed to settle away from the start, raced two wide into the first turn and was content to trail into the backstretch run, gained ground
two wide and between runners into the far turn, asked for run into the stretch, angled three to four wide for the drive, was floated out by ACCLIDER at
mid-stretch, closed willingly into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner into deep stretch and was second best. ACCLIDER broke in at the start,
rushed up to stalk the early pace from the inside, shifted to the outside entering the backstretch run and chased SEA DOG through decent fractions heading
to the half-mile marker, ran in pursuit two to three wide into the far turn, drifted out into the stretch and bothered RULER OF ANGELS nearing the furlong
grounds, yielded to the top pair past mid-stretch and was a clear third. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) ceded the early lead to SEA DOG, tracked outside of that
rival into the first turn, went four wide into the backstretch run and tracked the decent pace while widest heading to the half-mile marker, chased three to four
wide into the far turn, was outrun into the stretch and could muster a late rally. HALF THROTTLE was forwardly placed away from the start, took back and
settled into the first turn, tracked the early pace two wide into the backstretch run, was unhurried while not far back heading to the half-mile marker, raced
three wide into the far turn, lost position at the quarter pole and did not threaten in the stretch drive. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE was allowed to settle and
saved ground into the first turn, maintained an inside path into the backstretch run and improved position at the half-mile, mounted an inside bid
approaching the quarter marker, could not sustain that run into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed
using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

TESORO broke alertly, ceded the early lead to ATOMIC DROP and stalked outside of that rival into the first turn, prompted the moderate pace through the
backstretch run, was roused into the far turn and challenged ATOMIC DROP at the quarter marker, took a narrow lead into upper stretch then was
confronted by ENOS SLAUGHTER heading to the furlong grounds, dueled gamely with that runner into the final sixteenth, found more in deep stretch,
repelled the runner-up in the final strides and held at the finish for a determined win. ENOS SLAUGHTER bumped by DANZING REBEL at the start and was
a bit slow into stride early on, recovered to settle just off of the early pace and raced between rivals into the first turn, well placed into the backstretch run
and tracked the moderate pace heading to the half-mile marker, chased two wide into the far turn, angled three wide at the quarter pole and loomed into
upper stretch, drew to even terms with TESORO and battled that rival to the furlong marker, dueled gamely into the final sixteenth, was repelled by the
determined winner in deep stretch and was a clear second. COUSIN RICHIE unhurried away from the start, saved ground into the first turn, maintained an
inside path into the backstretch run and was content to trail heading to the half-mile pole, chased two wide into the far turn, angled four wide for the stretch
drive and gained ground at the furlong pole, could not make headway on the leading pair into the final sixteenth and held safely in the end for third. WE CAN
settled just off of the early pace, saved ground into the first turn and was well placed into the backstretch run, maintained an inside position heading to the
half-mile marker, saved all of the ground into the far turn, got caught a bit in tight at the quarter marker and angled three wide for the stretch drive, was
outkicked at mid-stretch and could not muster a late response. ATOMIC DROP away in good order, assumed early command and set the pace into the first
turn, carved out moderate fractions while prompted by TESORO along the backstretch run, dueled TESORO into the far turn, was overhauled into upper
stretch and faded in the drive. DANZING REBEL broke a bit awkwardly and was away a step slowly, rushed up to track the early pace three wide into the
first turn, stalked the moderate pace from the outside through the backstretch run, chased four wide into the far turn and lost ground at the quarter marker,
was outrun into the stretch and tired in the final stages. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL HORNET broke well and was sent to the front, dueled briefly with COWBOY KISSES then went clear heading into the turn, was then challenged
by MY DOMINATOR from the five-sixteenths marker, lost the lead briefly in upper stretch, engaged in a spirited duel down the stretch, battled back gamely,
regained the lead and held off that stubborn rival to the wire. MY DOMINATOR broke well but was not fast enough early to join the dueling leaders early,
responded when put into a drive from the seven-sixteenths pole and was even up with IMPERIAL HORNET near the five-sixteenths marker, went
head-to-head with that foe for the whole of the stretch, had a head in front briefly in upper stretch but could not hold off the resurgent foe and came up short
in a solid effort. COWBOY KISSES broke best and and was forwardly placed from the start, stayed out wide and was content to track just off the pace, took
the three path through the turn then went five to six wide into the stretch and finished willingly when set down, outfinished the rest for third despite being on
the left lead most of the stretch but was never a threat to the top two. BIG DON'S SMILING hesitated at the break, intimidated by the antics of STRETCH
RUN in the adjacent stall, rushed into contention as the field headed down the backstretch, advanced through the turn while racing about three wide,
loomed a threat a the head of the stretch but flattened out and finished evenly. MY BUCKET LIST broke a step slow but recovered quickly and was up close
in the early stages, was allowed to drift out to the three path with the rider keeping a tight rein, made a mild move through the turn then was drifting out
some down the stretch, flattened out and finished evenly. STRETCH RUN broke in a tangle, spotted the field several lengths head start, chased the field to
the stretch and passed one late. MISSED CALL lacked speed from the start, settled near the rear of the field while saving ground, tried to launch a rally on
the turn but was outrun from the five-sixteenths pole and could not make an impact from that point. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed
using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
