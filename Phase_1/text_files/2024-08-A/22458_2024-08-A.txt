Footnotes
CHATEAU was hustled from the gate then strode clear, extended the advantage leaving the backstretch, drew off while inside on the turn, came under a
right-handed crop in upper stretch, was given one final pop of the crop while shortening stride outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under a
strong hand-ride from that point to the finish. BRONX BOMBER was urged along between horses, dropped back late on the backstretch then angled in, was
guided from the two path to the rail early on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop, swapped back to his inside lead outside the furlong marker and
safely secured the place. CRITICAL THREAT was hustled from the gate, chased the solo leader on the outside, dropped further behind that foe leaving the
backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, spun into the stretch in the three path and lacked the needed kick while able to get third. WRITER'S
REGRET was hustled from the gate, settled under some restraint, was roused in the three path on the turn then driven into the stretch in the four path and
lacked the needed response. CHARGING AERO was urged along on the outside, traveled around the turn in the four path, turned into the stretch in the five
path and failed to rally.

PEAK POPULARITY went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, was well rated while well off the inside, dropped in leaving the backstretch, was
asked while inside on the far turn, came under one pop of a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker then one more inside that marker, drew off under a
strong hand-ride into the final sixteenth then was eased up late while much the best. TONED UP tracked in the two path through the first turn, settled at the
rear, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, was carried out while chasing
ICHIBAN for second in the final furlong and just got up for that position while no match for the winner. ICHIBAN broke out at the start, raced in the three path
on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive then came out some
before being straightened by the rider, pursued the winner past the eighth-pole, drifted out in the final furlong and lost second position.

KEY POINT dueled four then three wide with JAK N BURNY to his inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
shied out under a left handed crop at the three-sixteenths when taking narrow command, shied out one more path and then came inwards as JAK N
BURNY was coming outwards and got bumped by that foe fighting head to head a sixteenth from home, came in forcing JAK N BURNY in two paths late
and just held on the wire. JAK N BURNY coaxed from the gate, dueled just off the inside and then along the inside with the aforementioned foe to his
outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was let out spinning two to three wide for home, got headed for command at the three-sixteenths,
dug in coming again and came out and bumped his main rival near the sixteenth marker, then got carried in two paths late and was bested on the line.
DAUFUSKIE ISLAND chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, altered out at the
three-sixteenths when KEY POINT shied out in front, then offered up a mild kick to procure the show honors. POMPOUS PRINCE chased along the inside

Footnotes
ARIANA RYE was hustled to the front, dictated terms while inside through the turn, responded well when put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, drew
off into the final furlong, came out when switched to a left-handed crop and given one pop near the sixteenth-pole then was eased up late while much the
best. GOING FOR GLORY was hustled from the gate then coaxed along off the pace, came under stronger encouragement in the two path on the turn,
shifted to the three path outside the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch in the four path and earned the place while no match for the winner. GOOD
MISSION was hustled from the gate, showed speed then was taken in hand and raced just off the pace, moved out a path leaving the backstretch, chased
in the two path through the turn and tired then was caught for the place while well clear for the show. MIA NIPOTINA was coaxed along on the outside, went
around the turn in the four then five path, turned into the stretch in the six path and failed to rally. MARY UNION AVE hit the outside of the gate then veered
out and was off a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went around the turn in the four then five path, came into the stretch in the six path then moved
out and failed to respond. DANCING LIANA was fractious in the gate then hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside, dropped back in the three
then four path on the turn, turned into the stretch a touch further out and came up empty. SONIA'S FLAME broke a step slow, was urged along near the
back, went around the turn in the two path, turned into the stretch in the three path and was no factor. HARMONYVILLE was fractious in the gate then
unprepared at the start and off slow, ducked out just after leaving the gate, tossed his head outside the five-eighths pole, went around the turn in the three
then four path, floated out to the seven path into the stretch and trailed.

MCDIESEL broke in at the start and was corrected, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into
upper stretch, drew clear under a drive, dug in under growing late threat and held gamely to prevail. IRON MAX coaxed from the gate, chased just off the
inside, got out three wide at the three-eighths and was corrected with a stiff left rein and a right handed crop, the rider nearly standing in the irons when
carrying RICHARD AVE briefly out to the four path, came under coaxing at that station, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a
challenge inside the final sixteenth but was ultimately staved off while well clear of the rest and along second best. RICHARD AVE coaxed from the gate,
chased just off the inside before heading three wide through the far turn, got briefly carried out at the three-eighths to the four path, swung six wide into
upper stretch and weakened. VAMONOS VAMONOS chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper
stretch, weakened. HIGH WATER MARK got pinched at the start, chased four to five wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three to
four wide for home and made no impact. REAL SAVVY chased three then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper
stretch and faltered. REVIVALISM chased four wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got placed to a protective hold and was eased up at the
five-sixteenths and guided well outside near the quarter pole, then got pulled up soon after near the outside fence and was attended to for a heat related
issue and subsequently transported off the course by equine ambulance. SKY MASTERSON broke in at the start pinching out HIGH WATER MARK,
chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, eased up near the quarter pole and went six wide into
upper stretch, got pulled up in the vicinity of the eighth pole, got attended to for a heat related issue and was walked off under his own power.

ON A SPREE bobbled at the start but broke on even terms for the front, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, drafted in the two path on the far
turn, dropped to the rail while asked inside the five-sixteenths pole, beat the runner-up to an inside opening while moving in front of that foe at that juncture,
rallied to the lead into upper stretch then kicked clear before being put to a left-handed crop, remained well clear under a drive into the final sixteenth and
held while put to lighter encouragement late.. COMPLETE AGENDA settled on the inside, passed the half-mile pole under restraint, drafted along the rail on
the far turn, was asked just as the winner dropped in front of him late on the far turn, checked when beaten by that foe to a rail opening at that juncture,
regained stride near the quarter-pole, moved off the rail in upper stretch and finished with good energy to secure second. DEBATE went around the first turn
in the two path, settled at the rear, moved out leaving the backstretch, chased four then five wide on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the six path while
under a drive, dropped in around the three-sixteenths pole and lacked the needed response while up for the show. ST ANDREWS went four wide on the first
turn, settled on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, chased in the four path on the far turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths pole,
dropped to the three path while on even terms for the lead into the stretch then lost touch with the winner and weakened then was caught for the show.
MYSTIC NIGHT was hustled from the gate, raced in the three path on the first turn, settled off the pace, went three wide early on the far turn, was roused
near the five-sixteenths pole then moved to the four path, hesitated in traffic outside the quarter-pole then steadied off heels, turned into the stretch in the
five path, drifted out outside the furlong marker and faltered. ROCCO STRONG charged the front of the gate just before the break and was off slow, moved
up on the outside, went five then four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the three path under
urging on the far turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off. BAR FOURTEEN went to the front, showed the way while off the inside,
was asked late on the backstretch, lost the lead under urging in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and stopped then was eased in
the final furlong but walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND RIDER CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF COMPLETE AGENDA, ON A
SPREE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE OUTSIDE THE QUARTER-POLE

Footnotes
JACKSON HEIGHTS saved ground at the tail of the field patiently handled until called upon with five-sixteenths to go, cut the corner into upper stretch,
rallied up the rail to issue a challenge inside the final furlong and was just up in the shadow of the wire to score. DR. KRAFT brushed the near side stall at
the start and then got bumped by SHADOW DRAGON, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into
upper stretch and seized command straightened away, dug in under a drive edging away to the eighth pole, then came under late threat from flanking
challengers and was nailed at the finish. SHADOW DRAGON got bumped at the start by CICCIOBELLO and in turn bumped DR/ KRAFT, chased just off
the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, issued a challenge inside the final eighth but missed at the end
while clear of the rest for the show honors. CUT THE CORD coaxed from the start, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. CICCIOBELLO broke out at the start bumping SHADOW DRAGON
into DR. KRAFT, showed the way in hand along the inside through the first turn and then two to three wide down the backstretch, had BALDIZAR advance
outside and dueled through the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and was displaced from command
straightened away, then weakened in the late stages. BREW PUB chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled out four to
five wide into upper stretch, offered no response. SIX PERCENT chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper
stretch, offered no rally. BALDIZAR coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace four to five paths off the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch,
advanced tucked three wide into the far turn and dueled for the front coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung three wide into upper stretch
and weakened in the drive. BARESE coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch,
tired. CURLIN'S WISDOM coaxed from the start, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch
when guided out and placed to a protective hold, then got eased home through to the finish but was walked off under his own power.

MCKULICK (GB) angled in early, was unhurried near the back in the two path, shifted four wide while roused midway through the final turn, rallied six wide
into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead coming to the furlong marker then moved clear under strong urging to prevail. PARNAC (FR) settled off the
pace, went around the first turn in the two path, tucked down to the inside before the wire for the first time, traveled comfortably while saving ground, was
roused on the final turn, rallied in the three path into the stretch, gained to make a bid near the furlong marker but was outfinished while just able to get the
place. CHOP CHOP steadied off heels nearing the first turn, saved ground on that bend, was reserved off the pace, raced in the three path on the second
turn, settled outside on the backstretch, went three then four wide on the final turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, rallied five wide into the stretch,
gained to make a bid near the furlong marker but was also outfinished then just missed the place while clear for the show. ETERNAL HOPE (IRE) raced in

Footnotes
MISS LAO coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside from the half mile pole, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch set down for the drive, drew off under a drive and was geared down in the late stages. DANCE ON AIR coaxed from the gate, chased three
then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while along well clear of the
rest and second best. HAYES BAY coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide
into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. BOMB SQUAD chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into
upper stretch and improved position to the finish. MALIBU'S DYNAMITE broke out at the start, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened. JUSTHEART four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. PAMPLONA RED broke out at the start bumping WICKED REYA solidly, chased just off the inside and then
along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. WINE AT MIDNIGHT broke out at the start,
chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. WELCOME BACK BABE
broke out at the start, chased five then four wide lightly coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and was eased home to
the finish. WICKED REYA got bumped at the start solidly by PAMPLONA RED, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, spun two to
three wide for home and was eased home to the wire.
