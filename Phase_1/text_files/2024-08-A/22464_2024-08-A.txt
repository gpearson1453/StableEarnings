Footnotes
BIG HUG set a well rated pace while well in hand, repelled rival's challenge on the turn, opened a clear lead turning for home when called upon, was kept to
task down the lane and geared down late as a much best winner. ECHO CREEK broke ourward leaving the gate, raced three wide stalking the leaders to
the far turn, steadily advance from four wide down the lane and finished willingly as second best. MAJESTIC OOPS raced wide into the first turn, angled in
to be three wide down the backside while moving up to press the pace, challenged the winner on the far turn, could not go with that one in upper stretch and
weakened late in the drive. PLUM BLUE tracked the leaders to the three-eighths pole and failed to respond when called upon dropping back as no threat.

Footnotes
BROKEN PROMISES tracked the leaders into the turn, waited patiently on the bend, angled three wide at the head of the lane rallying to take a clear lead in
mid-stretch and held-on late. HIGHER IMAGE reserved off the pace to trail for the first half, saved ground cutting the corner turning for home, rallied gamely
up the fence in the lane and just missed. MONOPOLIZE hopped at the the start to give the field a couple lengths, gained ground on the backstretch,
commenced a rally midway on the bend, worked through traffic in the lane to continue to gain ground down the stretch in a good effort. RISING STRONG
stalked the pace to the turn, rallied three wide to loom turning for home and flattened out late in the lane. MISS MCBRIDE broke alertly to race off to a clear
early lead in a rapid first quarter and steadily faded. MIDNITRAINTOGEORJA was well placed just off the leader early, moved to press the pace entering the
turn, took a brief lead on the bend from between rivals and gave way.

OAK BAY QUALITY tracked the leaders from two wide to the turn, angled out to engage the pacesetter from four wide at the quarter pole, opened a clear
lead in mid-stretch and pulled away convincingly. WORKIN FOR THE MAN reserved off the pace for the first quarter, circled five wide with a steady
advance and rallied to gain the place while failing to switch leads. SIRACHA raced just off the leaders along the fence down the backside, was in tight
quarters nearing the three-eighths pole, was held up early on the bend to lose position and re-bid through the lane with good late interest after steadying
again near the three-sixteenths MY KIND OF NITE set a pressured pace for a half mile and weakened in the stretch. TRUE ALYBYE was not a threat.
FLIRTATION CARD pressed the pace from two wide down the backstretch and was through early.

RUNNINFORCOVER rated off the pace in the early going, made a steady gain to rally five wide turning for home and closed well to be along in time.
MOONSHINE NOW pressed the pace into the turn ,took command at the head of the lane, kicked clear in mid-stretch and was caught late in the drive to be
second best. BIG AL'S VISION broke outward, took command shortly away from the gate to set a pressured pace to the quarter pole and weakened down
the lane. BOSS MAN CAN shuffled at the start to be near the rear giving the field several lengths, was set to a drive midway on the turn and ground his way
along to hit the board. HALLISAR tracked the pace from the rail to be well placed on the turn and failed to mount a closing rally. BEAUGATTI pressed the
early pace and steadily faded. ADRIEN'S AURORA trailed and was never a factor.

MUCHO MAGIC stalked the pace to midway on the turn, was set to a long drive, rallied four wide turning for home and prevailed in a determined drive.
BARE BACK JACK pressed the pace leaving the half mile pole to battle with the pacesetter to mid-stretch, took a brief lead late in the lane and could not
hold the winner off in a game effort. WEDGE POND broke alertly to take the lead, angled in shortly away from the gate crowding the runners to his inside,
set a pressured pace to midway down the lane and weakened. IT WORKED crowded in the early going causing him to steady in the first sixteenth, settled
near the rear of the field and rallied mildly with late interest. SMARTY RIVER PANTS checked early when crowded into the rail, taken up, swung to outside,
evenly. SPORTSCARR was in tight in the early going when the field was collapsed by the pacesetter, moved up to track the leaders for a half and lacked a
clsosing response fading in the stretch. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING IN THE FIRST SIXTEENTH, UPON REVIEW
THEY MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
GLAVA hustled early to be sent for the lead while racing four wide in the first turn, settled well to be the pacesetter down the backside, opened a clear lead
on the far turn, responded when engaged in the lane and repelled all challenges to prevail gamely. RIVERSIDE broke a step tardy to be the early trailer,
gained position down the backstretch to be well placed along the rail, cut the corner turning for home and rallied willingly up the fence but was denied in a
good effort. FOUR O SIX CREED tracked the leaders for three-quarters, made a three wide bid in upper stretch to loom inside the eighth pole and hung. I'M
DASHING stalked the pace through the far turn to be in striking position and finished evenly unable to mount a closing kick. IT'S A FACT raced wide in the
first turn, settled to be rated off the pace down the backside, mounted a brief five wide bid into the final bend and flattened out. KYSTONE trailed to the far
turn and lacked a response when called upon. KEEN FLATTER pressed the pace for a half mile, started to lose position nearing the far turn, was taken up
when in tight at the three-eighths pole and finished evenly. THE RIDER OF KEEN FLATTER CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST RIVERSIDE FOR
INTERFERENCE AT THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
SMART PLAY took command away from the gate, set the pace on a comfortable lead for a half, dueled under pressure for the next half mile to mid-stretch
and edged away in the final eighth in a very game effort. FLASHFORDANI prompted the early pace, slipped up the fence to engage the leader after
five-eighths, dueled to mid-stretch on the lead, could not go with the winner and held on to the palce in deep stretch in a good try. DECOY tracked the pace
through the first turn, made a middle move from four wide between rivals down the backside, lost position on the turn, angled to the inside saving ground
cutting the corner turning for home, searched for a clear path in upper stretch and rallied belatedly inside the final sixteenth. POINT TO THE STARS made a
middle moe from five wide down the backstretch to be well placed into the far turn and failed to sustain the rally. COOLWIND broke a step slow to be the
trailer, continued at the rear of the field to the final bend and passed weaker rivals coming home. GABBYSONHOLIDAY failed to menace. DERZKII stalked
the pace for a half and dropped back as no threat.
