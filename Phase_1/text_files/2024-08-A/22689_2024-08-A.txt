Footnotes
I LOVE VENEZUELA vied for the early lead near the inside and finished strongly to draw clear under steady pressure. BAINBRIDGE DANCER pressed the
early leader from the outside and was no match for the winner in the drive. MY HUNNY BUNNY was bumped at the start, chased from the inside, saved
ground through the turn and kept on for the show position. LODGE HILL was under a hard chase early, raced two deep around the far turn and was even
with no late gain. ERA was bumped at the start, raced near the inside around the far turn into the lane, angled out near the three sixteenths pole and
needed more in the drive. OUR LADY IN RED was shuffled back at the start, raced six wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. PICARDY was off
slowly, raced off the early going after the poor start, saved ground and never threatened. EMPRESS CELEST hustled along, checked between early on and
never threatened.

handling. MADE TO HUSTLE showed good early speed to set the pace, was clear nearing the sixteenth pole and missed in a game effort. BOURBON

belatedly from the outside. ANY SUGAR HONEY pressed the early leader from the outside of rival under an early pursuit and weakened in the latter stages
three deep. NAUTICAL NATURE chased the pace from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. EDWARD MADDEN checked between near the
three eighth pole, raced from the inside into the upper stretch and never threatened. PARK PLACE urged along early, raced three deep around the far turn

NAVY RULES dueled three deep from the outside of foes and drew off late to prove best under strong handling. SPORTING THE GOLD dueled for the early
lead towards the inside, kept on but was no match for the winner. GOING AT IT dropped back early off the early going, hard ridden three to four wide
around the far turn and made a late gain to improve position. FREEDOM'S START raced mid pack early, saved ground through the far turn and needed
more in the drive. EMPTY MY POUCH void of early speed, raced six deep into the upper stretch and had no late rally. CHUCKA MOON was hard sent near
the rail and stopped.
