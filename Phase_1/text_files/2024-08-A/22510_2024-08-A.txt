Footnotes
JONAS' DREAM sprinted clear and set the pace up the backstretch, inched away around the bend from the rail, set down in upper stretch,, remained
unchallenged into deep stretch and held safely. LUTHER PASS chased the speed inside a trio of rivals, ridden along the rail then two wide on the turn,
asked left handed late on the bend, closest in pursuit in the drive but could not whittle the gap on the winner late. ZAFIRO ANEJO stalked four deep to the
turn, moved out to the five path then angled back in a few paths leaving the bend, lacked a bid in the lane but managed to save third. WESTEROS got
crowded between rivals early and dropped back, made progress up the backstretch, took the turn two to three wide and missed third. IGNATOWSKI tracked
five deep in the early going, took the turn five then six wide and could not threaten. UPLIFT raced in range between rivals, chased two wide around the bend
and faded in the lane. SPEED OF THE NILE chased three deep up the backstretch, moved out and came five wide into the lane and weakened.
RINGTONE raced near the back outside a rival then trailed on the inside, eased off the fence around the bend and could not make an impact. TOO WILD
TO TAME traveled at the rear off the inside, took the turn two to there wide and was never a factor. WAR ON THE WEST drifted in shortly after the start
then drifted again leaving the chute and became rank when corrected, saved ground off the pace to the stretch and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
DESERT RHAPSODY grabbed the early lead and led two wide then along the rail on the first turn, took pressure from BOLT D'VINE up the backstretch, put
that rival away at the three-eighths pole, drew away under hand urging around the bend, opened up powerfully early in the stretch under a drive, ridden
along into the final sixteenth and was in hand approaching the wire. BOLT D'VINE raced up close three then two wide, applied pressure from outside in the
middle stages, could not keep up with the winner on the far turn, chased two wide into the and kept on for a clear second. WINE ON TAP rank early chasing
in the two path on the first turn, moved inside to stalk up the backstretch, asked through the far turn and bested the rest. TECUMSEH CAROLINE allowed to
settle on the fence then moved into the two path around the clubhouse turn, navigated the far turn four wide then came three wide into the lane, could not
rally and got outfinished for third. MISS ROCKETTE chased three wide around the first turn then moved up outside the top pair, coaxed along three then two
wide on the second bend and lacked the needed response. PROFESSORS' PRIDE broke well then started to pull badly became rank along the inside,
trailed under a hold early on the backstretch, dropped back past the half-mile pole, was not persevered with on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked

Footnotes
WILLOW COVE tracked in range between rivals, paused briefly to let the rivals from both sides go ahead into the turn, angled to the inside and was on the
move, lacked room behind the leader and steadied at the top of the lane, gained a clear path and launched a bid from the fence at the eighth pole, then
drew clear from outer rivals in deep stretch. ON THE EQUINOX bumped leaving the gate, traveled on the inside near the back into the turn, angled out and
came four wide into the lane, rallied from outside and got up for second. PRACTICAL DAZZLE antsy in the gate, sat off the pace and moved inside, angled
four wide leaving the bend, rallied to head the leader with a furlong remaining but got outkicked by WILLOW COVE in the final sixteenth and was nailed for
second. LADY MONCLAIRE bumped inner rival leaving the gate, chased from the rail into the turn, shifted over to the two path around the bend, put in a
mild bid between rivals at the eighth pole but flattened out in the late stages. JANE KENDEIGH traveled outside a rival near the back, went two then three
wide on the turn before getting floated out to the five path leaving the bend and could not rally. SHE'S JUST GRAND trailed along the inside up the
backstretch, hugged the rail to the stretch and improved position. PERKINS vied inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch, drew clear at the five-sixteenths
pole, asked right handed approaching the stretch, collared at the eighth pole, relinquished the lead shortly after and weakened late. FLY AT KNIGHT
tracked three deep early, raced a bit greenly two to three wide on the turn, raced greenly in upper stretch and faded. CONQUEST CELSIUS vied three deep

badly on the turn and was not preserved with.

Footnotes
CAJUN BROTHER sped to the front and moved over to the inside, challenged by a trio of rivals leaving the backstretch, dueled with SUNRISE JOURNEY
through the turn, inched ahead in upper stretch and drew clear in the end to prove best. SUNRISE JOURNEY broke well and raced up close, bid between at
the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled from outside around the bend, fought to the sixteenth pole and yielded late. EL DIABLO ROJO bothered leaving the gate,
raced near the back and moved inside, lacked room to advance when boxed in along the inside on the turn, cut the corner int other stretch and finished well
to pass RIVOLI for third. RIVOLI settled inside, advanced from the fence around the bend, angled out at the top of the lane and got edged for third. WORTH
LOOKING sat off the pace off the rail, ridden along two wide then angled out and came four wide into the stretch, brushed with inner rival at the top of the
lane and could not rally. PERFECT D tracked off the rail, climbed a bit early, got boxed in on the turn, spun three wide into the lane, tried to angle out but got
hemmed in and had to check in upper stretch and was not persevered with late. C'MON MAN broke a step slow, coaxed along the inside at the back, moved
out approaching the turn, angled out and raced six wide leaving the bend, cut back inside and improved position. CALL MY BANKER stalked outside rivals
then challenged four deep leaving the backstretch, lost touch quickly on the turn, chased four then three wide around the bend and weakened. ROYAL
HALO tracked three deep into the turn, dropped back three wide around the bend and came up empty. HANDSOME GARY chased from off the pace out
wide, took the turn four then five wide and could not offer a response when asked. ALTRUIST forwardly placed in the early going then went up to fight for
the lead three deep between rivals at the seven-sixteenths pole, lost touch with the top pair early on the turn, chased three then two wide and tired down the
lane.

STAY HOT unhurried in the early going and moved to the inside racing at the back, started to move on the far turn from the fence then tipped two wide at
the quarter pole, drew alongside the top pair with a furlong remaining and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. KING OF GOSFORD (GB) tracked the pace two
wide, suffered a mild shuffle behind PRINCE OF POWER at the five-sixteenths pole, altered to the inside, angled out at the top of the lane and rallied to
gain second. ATITLAN rated on the fence in the early going, ran up on the heels of the leader at the five-eighths pole, continued along the rail to the far turn,
tipped out and challenged two wide at the five-sixteenths pole, dueled and took over late on the bend, gave the lead back to FINAL BOSS in upper stretch,
fought on to the sixteen pole and faltered late. FINAL BOSS stepped to the front from inside, pressured at the five-eighths pole then cleared at the next
marker, met the challenge from ATITLAN at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command briefly late on the turn, regained the advantage in upper stretch,, fought
with outer rivals to the sixteenth pole and weakened. PRINCE OF POWER closest in pursuit from the two path early, drew alongside the leader early on the
backstretch and took hold to move back to a stalking position, fell back to last on the far turn and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
RICKS RED STORM sent for the lead and dueled from outside, inched ahead from FORMIDABLE THREAT, saw that rival dropped back but now had to
content with LAST CALL PAUL around the bend, lost the lead entering the lane, battled on to deep stretch, then dug in late and edged the runner-up in the
closing moments. LAST CALL PAUL broke well and raced up close from inside, got put in tight approaching the three-eighths pole, found space and went
up to challenge for command, dueled and took over into the lane, maintained a short lead over RICKS RED STORM through the lane but faltered in the final
strides. JARAMA forwardly placed outside a rival, got shuffled back behind FORMIDABLE THREAT on the turn, tipped to the three path then chased two
wide into the lane, kept on trying through the lane and gained the show. ARTIST POINT stumbled shortly after the start, chased from inside, tipped three
wide at the quarter pole, finished evenly in the final furlong and lost the show. INVESTALOT fractious in the gate, brushed with inner rival at the start,
climbed early chasing off the pace, angled in and saved ground on the turn, cut the corner into the lane and failed to threaten. GOLDEN RIVER popped the
gate open prior to the start, raced in range three deep into the turn, lost ground around the bend, spun five wide into the lane and failed to menace.
NAWILIWILI broke a step slow, coaxed to a forward position from outside, lost ground around the bend, entered the stretch four wide and faded. KEEP IT
COMING brushed leaving the gate, climbed early and raced at the back, lugged out on the turn, exited the bend seven wide and was never a factor.
AMERICAN RENEGADE broke a step slow, raced off the pace outside rivals, came six wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. FORMIDABLE
THREAT showed early speed then dueled inside the winner, dropped back on the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
BOB'S BLUE MOON got crowded between rivals early, moved up from inside, angled out on the turn, bid three deep late on the bend, took over in upper
stretch and maintained a short lead over LEMON SUSHI to the wire. LEMON SUSHI dueled for the lead from outside up the backstretch and around the
turn, vied between foes entering the lane, lost command in upper stretch and stayed on inside the winner to the line. IRISH ROYALTY coaxed along from
inside off the pace, looked to advanced but got blocked behind rivals around the bend, angled three wide into the stretch and outclosed SUPERNAL for the
show honors. SUPERNAL got bumped and took up early, trailed up the backstretch and moved inside, angled four wide around the bend, got floated out in
upper stretch, kept on through the lane but edged by IRISH ROYALTY for third. DOUBLE JAB fractious in the gate, away quickly then chased the top pair
four deep into the turn, remained wide to the stretch and lacked a rally. IMPEACHALOT had a shoe repair in the paddock, broke through the gate and was
reloaded, broke outward to lose a step, chased off the pace, went four wide around the bend, drifted out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. CALIFORNIA
TIGER sat outside a rival towards the rear, went two wide into the turn, angled out and exited the bend five to six wide, got floated out in upper stretch and
lacked further response. DISOBEY broke through the gate and was reloaded, sent from inside to duel for the lead, vied with outer pair into the lane and
weakened. ONE STRONG CAT brushed with inner rival shortly after the start, bumped with IMMELMANN early, chased between then moved inside on the
turn while losing ground and weakened down the lane. IMMELMANN bumped with ONE STRONG CAT early, chased three deep leaving the backstretch,
three then two wide on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
HOPE ROAD showed the way under pressure from outside to the turn, inched clear on the turn, roused in upper stretch, powered away under hand urging
and was ridden out to the wire. NOKIE unhurried in the beginning, raced well off the rail then angled into the three path for the turn, made progress while
steered back out and came five wide into the lane, tipped out widest at the top of the stretch, could not make any impact on the winner but finished
determinedly to best the rest. SEQUIN LADY chased four deep into the turn, drew closer around the bend, raced five wide turning for home, could not
produce a bid but managed to outlast SCARY FAST RIDE for the show honors. SCARY FAST RIDE tracked three deep, crept closer outside rivals on the
turn, entered the lane four wide, finished in tandem with SEQUIN LADY and got edged for third. DON'T BRING CRAZY prompted the pace from outside
then between rivals, chased two wide past the five-sixteenths pole and faded down the lane. CLASS CLOWN attended the pace three deep to the turn,
chased in the three path past the five-sixteenths pole and weakened. DADS ESTRELLA stalked outside a rival, asked two to three wide on the turn and
tired. AYE CANDY lost her path early, climbed chasing off the rail, went two, three, then four wide on the turn and failed to menace. KRISTI'S TIGER
bumped with outer rival and checked early, trailed up the backstretch, continued at the rear three wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. UR IN
TROUBLE bumped and steadied early, raced on the inside near the back, got shuffled back on the turn, went two wide into the stretch and failed to menace.
REPORT forwardly placed on the inside, started to weakened around the bend and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
IRISH CORN showed the way under pressure early, cleared past the three-eighths pole, put to left handed urging in the lane, remained unchallenged into
the final sixteenth, then was confronted by the runner-up late and lasted. BELLY UP forwardly placed up the backstretch, saved ground behind the
pacesetter on the turn, moved off the rail at the top of the stretch, chased within striking distance into deep stretch, put in a late bid but got denied. MOON
ICE traveled near the back on the inside, gained from the fence through the turn, angled out into the lane and offered a mild rally for third. YO TIME raced in
mid-pack on the inside, eased over to the two path around the bend and kept trying down the lane to whittle the gap late. RACHEL'S COACH pressed the
leader from outside, lost touch early on the turn, still closest in pursuit two wide leaving the bend and weakened down the lane. MR. BIG HEART was off a
bit slow to begin, raced between foes near the back, brushed outer rival at the three-eighths pole, got boxed in at the five-sixteenths marker, angled inward
and lacked a rally. LOGON TO WIN sat off the pace off the rail, came three wide into the lane and proved no menace. UNZIP ME LORD off slow in the
beginning, trailed early then raced four deep at the back into the turn, angled in and had one beat entering the lane, then passed another tired rival in the
drive. WHERE'S THE LOOT showed early speed between rivals then chased two wide leaving the backstretch, exited the bend in the three path and
weakened. THIRSTY THURSDAY raced three deep near the back then between rivals approaching the turn, got brushed by MR. BIG HEART and checked
at the three-eighths pole and could not make any impact after.

IN THE AIR TONIGHT broke a step slow, coaxed along at the back then raced three deep into the turn, closed in while easing over to the four path,
challenged the top trio from outside entering the lane, took over in upper stretch, put THIRSTY MAMA away past the eighth pole and drew off. THIRSTY
MAMA stalked three deep into the turn, bid three deep a quarter mile out, led briefly in upper stretch before being overtaken by IN THE AIR TONIGHT,
drifted in past the eighth pole and stayed on to secure second. THIRSTY IN VEGAS bumped leaving the gate, pressed the pace then dueled up the
backstretch, fought two wide through the turn then between rivals leaving the bend, could not keep up with a furlong remaining and flattened to third.
BROADWAY VENUS stumbled and bumped at the start, recovered and went up to take control early with THIRSTY IN VEGAS to the outside, dueled with
that rival into and around the far turn, fought inside a trio of the rivals exiting the bend, yielded in upper stretch and gave way. LIL' BIT BOSSY bumped hard
with inner rival in the beginning, stalked between foes, rounded the bend two to three wide and lacked a response when called upon.
CORALGABLESKAYLIN bumped hard with LIL' BIT BOSSY at the start, trailed early then inside rivals at the back, had to take a bit of a hold running up
behind LIL' BIT BOSSY into the turn, asked two wide around the bend and weakened. NOSTRI VIRES stalked inside a pair of rivals, roused on the turn,
cornered nicely into the lane and faded. KNIGHTWITHLOUIS brushed with outer rival at the start, sat off the pace off the rail then between rivals leaving the
backstretch, dropped back to last on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
MARGOT'S BOY stalked in hand along the rail, tugged on the backstretch and ran up on heels at the half-mile pole, waited behind the top pair on the far
turn, found a seam approaching the stretch, bid between and took over at the eighth pole and remained strong to the wire. SPIRIT MAKER unhurried in the
early going and moved inside, drew closer between rivals on the far turn then angled out and came five wide into the lane, bid five deep at the top of the
lane, fought with inner pair into deep stretch and got outkicked by the winner. MACKINNON rated on the inside, ran into traffic at the quarter pole, spun
three wide into the lane, set down at the eighth pole, angled to the inside and finished willingly to gain third. LIL RICHARDS BELLO tracked in the two path,
drew closer on the far turn and took aim three then four wide approaching the stretch, challenged in upper stretch but was outfinished in deep stretch.
DON'T SWEAR DAVE stalked the pacesetter two wide, applied pressure from outside at the midway point, headed the leader at the quarter pole, took over
late on the turn, drifted out a bit upper stretch, lost command at the eighth pole and weakened. MOODY JIM (IRE) allowed to settle outside a pair of rivals,
continued three deep around the far turn, angled out upper stretch, and lacked a rally. TABLE FOR TEN steered to the inside and laid far off the pace early,
drew a bit closer from the rail on the far turn, moved out in the lane and failed to threaten. VANZZY pulled two wide then between rivals, steadied off heels
at the half-mile pole, raced outside a rival into the far turn, chased between around the bend and failed to menace. MITICO sped to the front and steered to
the inside, took pressure nearing the halfway point, coaxed along into the far turn, headed at the quarter pole, lost the advantage late on the bend, yielded in
upper stretch and folded. GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR settled three deep in mid-pack, raced outside a rival into the far turn, angled out and came six wide into
the stretch and lacked further response. MAN FRIDAY reared at the start to break far behind the field and never got involved. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED
THE START OF MAN FRIDAY AND RULED THAT HE WAS NOT AWARDED A FAIR START AND IS DECLARED A NON-STARTER.
