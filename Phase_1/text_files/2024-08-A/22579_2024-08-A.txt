Footnotes
R B'S TIGER coaxed from the gate and raced outside the leader up the backstretch, challenged at the quarter pole, took over into the lane, cleared in upper
stretch and remained strong to the wire. PLAY MY SPEED stalked from inside, coaxed along around the bend, lacked room when boxed in late on the turn,
tipped out a bit for a clear path and finished evenly late. MAYACAMA settled off the pace in the early going, went four wide into the turn, angled down to the
two path around the bend, tipped out back out into the lane, churned on for the show honors but failed to threaten. MANIAE stalked between foes then
outside a rival, eased out around the bend and raced in the four path turning for home, then weakened down the lane. PANCHO BARNES tracked three
deep up the backstretch, came four wide into the lane, altered out a bit at the eighth pole and could not rally. TOM'S STAR raced at the back and moved
inside, saved ground through the turn, altered around troubled rival in upper stretch and failed to menace. VERONICA'S GEM showed good early foot to
take control and set the pace up the backstretch, challenged from outside with a quarter mile remaining, lost command entering the stretch, ducked into the
rail and unseated her rider in upper stretch and was transported off the track via equine ambulance. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING
THE INCIDENT IN UPPER STRETCH AND RULED THAT VERONICA'S GEM CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS AND NO OTHER RIVAL WAS AT FAULT
SO THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
SUPER ENTICING stalked from the rail, tipped two wide on the far turn, chased between into the stretch, latched onto the leader midstretch and drove clear
in the final sixteenth. SWEET LAKER broke well then stalked the leader two wide into the first turn, applied pressure from outside around the bend, took
over approaching the quarter pole, put away inner rival shortly after, showed the way into the final furlong, confronted by SUPER ENTICING midstretch,
offered little resistance and relinquished the lead in deep stretch and kept on to hold second. CHEEKIEST tracked in the two path, crept closer two then
three wide on the far turn, put in a mild bid in upper stretch but flattened in the late stages. ENGLISH DANGER pulled early then ran up on heels chasing
between rivals into the first turn, was a bit rank early on the backstretch, fought the rider again at the five-sixteenths pole, angled out in upper stretch and
improved position. LEOPARDESS (GB) reserved next to the fence, went two wide into the far turn, angled four wide around the far turn and lacked a rally.
TRUE PATRIOT sat off the pace three deep, ridden along three wide then got floated out to the five path around the far turn and could not answer the call
when put to a drive. GOLDEN TEMPER cleared from outside and steered across, showed the way under pressure from SWEET LAKER to the far turn, lost
the advantage approaching the quarter pole and weakened in the lane.

SEPTEMBER MAGIC raced in range from inside, challenged the top trio from the rail past the five-sixteenths pole, took over past the quarter pole, cleared
at the top of the stretch, drew off under a drive and was ridden out in the final furlong. BOLT ON THE ROCKS vied inside a pair of rivals holding a short lead
into the turn, inched ahead early on the bend, allowed the winner to challenge from inside, lost command past the quarter pole, lost contact with that rival at
the top of the stretch and bested the rest. AUDITORY stumbled and got bumped from inside leaving the gate, trailed in the early going, advanced from
inside on the turn, came off the rail a bit in the lane and gained the show. RUNNING SUPER broke out and bumped AUDITORY, chased off the rail,
traveled wide through the turn and raced in the five path turning for home and could not summon the needed rally. JAI HO stumbled a bit then took up when
losing path in the beginning, raced near the back, came five wide into the stretch and passed tired rivals. QUEEN GIRVIN chased from off the pace outside
rivals, stayed well off the rail and came six wide into the lane and lacked the needed response. GIFT OF TIME vied three deep to the turn, chased the top
pair four wide past the quarter pole and faded out of contention. DISPOSITION vied between foes up the backstretch, urged to keep up on the turn, lost
touch with the front pair at the quarter pole, spun three wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. SHE'S MUY MUY broke well then climbed early and
dropped off the pace, went two wide into the turn, eased out to the four path around the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
RUGELACH pressed the pace from outside, lost touch briefly with the leader at the half-mile pole before latching on once again, took over at the quarter
pole, cleared shortly after, then drew away under hand urging and a few taps of right handed encouragement. ADELIE (IRE) broke well then got crowded
between rivals early, trailed on the inside to the far turn, angled three wide leaving the bend, summoned a mild rally and gained second.
ILLHAVEANOTHERKISS stalked two then three wide around the first turn, stayed off the rail up the backstretch, chased three deep into the lane, lacked a
bid in the late stages and got outkicked for second. SHE'S GOT A WAY tucked inside off the pace in hand early, drew closer past the half-mile pole, had to
wait behind the leaders on the far turn while shifting over to the two path, asked once in the clear but flattened out. TIERGARTEN rated along the inside,
traveled two wide out of range into the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and lacked further response. ALOHA KITTEN took control from inside and
showed the way under pressure from RUGELACH, tried to shake free at the midway point but failed to do so, carried a short lead into the far turn, lost
command a quarter mile out and gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
CHICK'S DIG IT well placed behind and to the outside of the top pair, bid three deep past the quarter pole, took over and cleared at the top of the lane, then
drew away under right handed urging and strong handling. JOE DON LOONEY dueled for the lead from outside, inched ahead past the three-eighths pole,
fought between rivals late on the bend, lost command into the stretch, could not go on with the winner into the furlong grounds but stayed on to secure
second. WINDRIBBON broke a step slow, stalked from inside into the turn, steered out and came four wide into the lane, summoned a mild rally but could
not get by JOE DON LOONEY for second. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF settled three deep in the early going, drifted five wide around the turn and could not
rally. PETESOLDFASHIONED unhurried in the beginning, coaxed along three deep leaving the backstretch, rounded the bend three then four wide and
improved position. KERRY GOLD off a bit slow from inside, raced head high early then climbed a bit up the backstretch, saved ground from the rail through
the turn and passed tired rivals. PLEASE FOCUS fought for the lead from inside, kept the pressure on JOE DON LOONEY through the turn, then weakened
in the stretch run. INSTINCT D' ORO stalked between rivals, coaxed along into the turn, lost ground two then three wide around the bend and weakened.
SAULS CALL had his path taken shortly after the start and dropped back, went between rivals at the half-mile pole, navigated the turn two then three wide
and failed to make an impact.

RUN FOR KIDDER dueled for the lead from outside, carried a short lead between rivals into the lane, dueled inside JOHNSON'S MAGIC into the final
furlong and turned away the runner-up in deep stretch. JOHNSON'S MAGIC chased from outside, bid three deep on the turn, raced on even terms with
RUN FOR KIDDER at the eighth pole but got turned away in the final sixteenth. KEEP DANCIN NICK broke well then chased off the inside, ran two wide
around the bend, found traffic in upper stretch, angled in the last the sixteenth and gained third. CALL ME SIR shifted in and bumped rival then lost his path,
went three deep into the turn, drew closer around the bend, came four wide into the lane and missed third. SEVAK chased along the inside, hugged the rail
to the stretch, got boxed in upper stretch, tipped out into the clear and kept trying late. GOT SOUL dueled for the lead from inside, fought inside a pair of
rivals on the turn, yielded in upper stretch and faded out of contention. UNCLE EVCO broke a step slow, ridden along near the back, saved ground then
tipped out into the lane and failed to menace. DANCING DILLON hard to load behind the gate, chased between then lost positions leaving the backstretch,

Footnotes
R HEISMAN bumped leaving the gate, chased between foes then had to steady off heels early, waited for room behind the leader past the five-sixteenths
pole, roused leaving the bend, chased within striking distance into deep stretch, then came with a late bid and drove past the runner-up in the final strides.
CASE HIT brushed inner rival at the start, took control early under pressure from I'M A BAD BOY to the outside, shook free at the quarter pole, led clear into
deep stretch and got run down by the winner approaching the wire. I'M A BAD BOY pressed the pace between rivals up the backstretch, asked to keep up
around the bend, lost contact with the leader at the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane, weakened but managed to secure the show. THE GYPSY
COWBOY coaxed from the gate, climbed a bit and dropped back, raced off the rail into the turn, angled out around the bend and spun seven wide into the
lane, kept trying in the drive and earned a minor award. LAST CALL ZONDLO broke out, attended the pace outside the top pair, chased the leaders three
then four wide past the quarter pole and faded down the lane. BODACIOUS got bumped on both sides and put in tight early, moved up between rivals but
had to steady off heels at the half-mile pole, ridden along three, four, then five wide on the turn and flattened out. TIMTY got brushed from outside then
bumped with inner rival shortly after the start, chased wide into the turn, navigated the bend five then six wide and had little left for the stretch run. NAP
stalked from inside, lost ground around the turn, entered the lane in the two path and weakened. INFAMOUS ANGEL tracked four deep leaving the
backstretch, moved into the three path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT off slow in the beginning, traveled on the inside towards the rear, was on the move around the far turn while angling out, swung eight
wide into the stretch, rallied to the front at the eighth pole and kicked clear. JOHN DUNBAR sat off the pace in the two path then moved inside, gained along
the fence around the far turn, challenged from the rail in upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner in the furlong grounds but outkicked
INCREDIBLE SHOT for the place honors. INCREDIBLE SHOT unhurried in the early going and steered into the two path, moved into range on the far turn,
swung seven wide into the stretch, rallied between rivals and got edged by JOHN DUNBAR for second. MEGA MOON raced in range two wide then
between rivals, shifted out and bumped rival on the first turn, checked into the backstretch, stalked outside a rival to the far turn, angled five wide leaving the
bend, took over in upper stretch, lost command in midstretch and flattened to fourth. FIREMAN DAN settled inside, tipped two wide around the far turn,
angled four wide into the lane, altered out behind rivals at the eighth pole and kept on to improve position. BEE CATCHER took hold when put in tight
between rivals early, tracked from inside, drew closer in the middle stages, got boxed in on the far turn, moved out and came three wide into the lane,
lacked room in upper stretch, roused midway through the lane, angled inward in deep stretch but was not persevered with. KIMMER trailed two wide then
moved inside, continued at the back to the far turn, hugged the rail to the stretch, tipped out and ran into traffic in upper stretch and failed to threaten.
NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) reserved in the two path, tracked in range three deep into the far turn, angled out and launched a bid six deep entering the
lane but flattened out in the final furlong. TOM AND JAZZY stalked three deep and got bumped by inner rival around the clubhouse turn, moved up
alongside the leader three deep on the backstretch, vied from outside through the far turn, fought in the four path turning for home and gave way.
AWESOME RHYTHM dueled from inside briefly then chased along the inside around the first turn, drew alongside the leader early on the backstretch and
pressed between to the far turn, fought on even terms around the bend and put a head in front at the quarter pole, lost command entering the lane and
folded. PHOENICIAN GHOST dueled outside AWESOME RHYTHM briefly then cleared and moved inside on the clubhouse turn, took pressure from that
rival and one more on the backstretch, vied along the rail through the far turn and relinquished the lead at the quarter pole, fought two wide into the lane and
gave way.
