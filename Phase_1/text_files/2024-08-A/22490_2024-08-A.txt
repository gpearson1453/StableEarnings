PRECISE TIMING set the pressured pace while racing two-wide, opened a clear lead nearing the stretch and maintained a safe advantage. SAPELLO LA
FINA angled to the inside early then moved up to prompt PRECISE timing, was in tight nearing the seven-sixteenths pole dropping back slightly then slipped
during the drive and finished strongly. A THOUSAND MILES saved ground tracking the leaders, angled out to be three-wide nearing the quarter pole,
offered a bid entering the stretch and then flattened out during the drive. COCONUT DREAMS was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and weakened
slightly. VIOLET KITTEN was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and showed some interest late. SUMMER REIGN was off a step slow then hit
the side of the gate, was allowed to settle, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. THE RIDER OF SAPELLO LA FINA LODGED
AN OBJECTION AGAINST PRECISE TIME BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
CIELO DIAMANTE was allowed to settle, moved up four-wide nearing the three-eighths pole, angled out to be seven-wide entering the stretch and finished
strongly to be up in the final strides then was pulled up on the turn following the race and transported off the track via the equine ambulance. RESERVOIR
stumbled at the start, then rushed up along the inside to set the pace, drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths pole to be six-wide entering the stretch and
just failed to last. DISTINCTIVE DEB was forwardly placed while racing two-wide and finished well for third in a steady effort. HEAT SEEKING LETA was
allowed to settle, moved forward while three-wide nearing the quarter pole and improved her position. SHELBY GOLD was unhurried early, came two-wide
into the stretch and failed to menace. JUSTIN'S LADY broke through the gate prior to the start but was quickly retained by the assistant start and reloaded
then prompted the early pace while racing two-wide and tired. CLASSIC LEAH was off a step slow then settled in the middle of the pack, came five-wide into
the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. NEISSA saved ground chasing the early pace and tired.
