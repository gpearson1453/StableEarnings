Footnotes
PURECRAZIGROOVE Vied for the lead along the two path, kicked clear some and under pressure proved best. B C GLORY DAYS Broke slow, unhurried
along the two path, responded and rallied inside. BET THE PALACE Tracked five wide into the turn, four wide out of it and finished with interest. NOAH'S
DESTINY Tracked four wide on the turn, three path into the lane, weakened and ran for purse money only. M. C. DOUBLE R Unhurried along the three
path, checked when PEACEFULPERSUASION drifted out, took the six path into the lane and failed to recover. THEWIPERSONTHEBUS Close up along
the rail to the lane and tired. PEACEFULPERSUASION Vied for the lead four wide early, drifted out nearing the quarter pole bothering M.C. DOUBLE R and
tired.
