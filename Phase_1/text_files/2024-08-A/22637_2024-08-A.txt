PLAY MISTY (IRE) broke out bumping rivals at the start, set the pace on the inside, shook free on the far turn, responded when roused, dug in gamely when
challenged by MISS ELLARY past midstretch, held determinedly and bumped with that rival at the wire. MISS ELLARY tracked on the inside, chased inside
on the far turn, angled out, commenced a rally racing a bit greenly in midstretch, then dug in gamely and was gaining slowly on the winner late, bumped at
the wire. WUDHOOH raced keen between rivals early on, continued off the pace between rivals, saved ground on the far turn, angled out and finished
evenly. KEEP IT SWEET was bumped and steadied at the start, trailed the field, moved up four wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and closed
mildly. TIME IS MAGIC steadied along the inside nearing the first turn, then settled off the pace with a ground saving trip and lacked a rally. TUCK CHECK
was bumped at the start, then steadied in the chute, raced three or four wide off the pace and failed to rally. THIS COUNTRY raced off the pace, moved up
three wide on the backside, then failed to threaten. OOPS HAHA stalked close up early on outside a rival, chased on the far turn and faded. BROOKMESA
was bumped at the start, then pulled early on while racing four wide, stalked two or three wide and faded. MONEY MAGNETTES pulled early racing on the
rail, continued with an inside trip and gave way on the far turn.
