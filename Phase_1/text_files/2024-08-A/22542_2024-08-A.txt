EXECUTIVE POWER shot out quickly as the rider lost the inside stirrup at the gate, he recovered said stirrup while moving clear and over toward the inner
rail and held sway under a steady drive. DASHED chased the lead and lasted for the place. ON TAP was jostled early, bid at the quarter pole and vied
between rivals, having to settle for show. VINO CALDO saved ground, vied inside rivals but had no late bid. HERO WORSHIP broke outward, stalked the
pace in the four path, but lacked a late bid. RUFFLED WATERS saved ground to no avail. CHANNEL Z had a slight hop at the start, then trailed.
COLLATOR bobbled at the start, raced in the four path and was through early.

rallied belatedly and got to the winner too late. SWEET AS SIN was off awkwardly, vied in the three path and yielded at the eighth pole. JIMMY RULES vied
between rivals and gave way in the stretch. GRAND ILLUSION was brushed at the start, stalked the pace inside and faded on the turn. LOOKIN FOR
GLORY stalked the pace in the four path and faded in the stretch. UNWORKABLE was not a factor. TAKE THE GOLD vied inside before giving way in the

Footnotes
OTIS ON THE CAPE vied early between rivals, bid at the three-eighths pole, drew off in the stretch and lasted under a steady drive. CAMPTON stalked the
early pace in the three path, settled, rallied at the eighth pole and just missed. DEEP STRIKE broke sharply, was unrushed outside, was seven wide at the
quarter pole, rallied late and missed. VELOCIMO led inside before settling on the turn and lacked a late bid. DON'T STOP pressed the early pace in the five
path, settled, then offered a mild late bid. FEAR AND LOATHING pressed the pace in the four path, then couldn't match strides on the turn. MAN WITH THE
MOVES raced evenly in the five path. NAK NAK BOLT saved ground to no avail. HILTON HEAD stalked early in the four path and gave way on the turn.
DOSSIER saved ground to no avail.
