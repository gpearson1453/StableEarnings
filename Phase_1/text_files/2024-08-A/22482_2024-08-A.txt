HOMERUNHAPPY good inside speed to the front, well handled to clear off in the late stages. MIKIE O'PRADO chased winner throughout, no match to wire,
bested the rest. SHAMMAH between horses early on, kept on while chasing top pair on even terms for show spot at the wire. AMICABLE raced along
evenly while finishing on even terms for show spot at the wire. CRONUS had an awkward from the gate with no speed to the turn, swung wide into the
stretch run with no gain. CAPE MARCO DRIVE no speed while back to the stretch, never threatened. LEAD ACTOR broke tardy from the gate and never
factored throughout.
