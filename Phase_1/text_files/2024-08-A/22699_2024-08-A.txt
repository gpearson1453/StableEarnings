Footnotes
NOTHING IS FOREVER broke a step slow, moved inside stalking in hand, waited on or a bit off the fence behind the top pair on the far turn, roused at the
top of the stretch, moved out to take aim at GLACIER RIM, latched onto the runner-up late and got up in time. GLACIER RIM stalked up close in the two
path, drew alongside the leader into the backstretch, flanked that rival into the far turn, headed HOLLYWOOD PENNY with a quarter mile remaining, put
that rival away in upper stretch, showed the way into the final sixteenth and got nailed by the winner at the wire. LAST ELIZABETHAN stalked the speed
outside a rival, rounded the far turn two to three wide, chased within striking distance in the final furlong but finished evenly late. HOLLYWOOD PENNY
showed good early foot from the rail and set the tone through the opening stages, took pressure into the backstretch, inched ahead past the half-mile pole,
threatened again by GLACIER RIM on the far turn, dueled into the lane, yielded in upper stretch and weakened. COMANCHE GAL was moving just before
the gates opened then threw her head at the start to spot the field several lengths, steered to the inside, drew closer on the clubhouse turn, ridden along still
at the back inside then two wide on the second bend and was not persevered with in the late stages. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING
THE START OF COMANCHE GAL AND RULED THAT SHE WAS MOVING JUST PRIOR TO THE START AND CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS WHEN
THE GATES OPENED SO THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
I DON'T GET IT brushed the gate, unhurried in the two path, tracked two to three wide on the far turn before angling out past and came under a ride past
the five-sixteenths pole, swept by the top trio from outside leaving the bend, kicked clear and was ridden out while drifting inward through the late stages.
CUPID'S CRUSADER showed early speed near the inside then took a stalking position on the clubhouse turn, raced between rivals leaving the backstretch,
bid two wide a quarter mile out, was no match for the winner in upper stretch, stayed on through the final furlong and was clearly second best. GUCCI BOY
raced in range two then three wide early, asked leaving the backstretch, chased in the three wide into the lane, was no match for the top pair but kept on to
overtake PASS THE BATON for third. PASS THE BATON pressed from outside four then three wide around the first turn, took over at the halfway point, put
away inner rival early on the far turn, challenged from outside past the quarter pole, lost command into the lane, had the rider lose the crop at the eight pole
and faded. UNCLE JOHN stumbled leaving the gate, laid off the pace four then three wide, raced outside a rival on the backstretch, took the second turn
four then five wide and weakened. FROST ALERT vied between into the first turn then took control around the bend, overtaken at the half-mile pole and
dueled to the seven-sixteenths pole, tired around the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
PRINCESS DADDY dueled for the lead inside RECYCLEYOURHEART, disposed of that rival late on the bend, opened up in upper stretch and remained
well clear under urging. DYIN A THIRST coaxed along early chasing outside a rival, took the turn two wide, tipped out into the lane, failed to threaten the
winner but finished determinedly to best the rest. SUNSET GRAZEN broke a step slow, shifted in and took up when losing her path at the start, climbed at
the back of the field early, went two wide into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the drive and kept on to earn the show honors. BUDS N SUDS sat
off the pace well off the rail, made some progress three to four wide on the turn but flattened out in the final furlong. APPLE VALLEY GIRL broke awkwardly
and inward but was quickly corrected, chased near the inside and climbed a bit behind a rival, traveled on the fence then two wide into the lane, split rivals
near the sixteenth pole but failed to threaten. RECYCLEYOURHEART dueled outside PRINCESS DADDY up the backstretch, fought alongside that rival to
the quarter pole, could not keep up late on the bend and gave way in the drive. PEBBLES B AWESOME was closest in pursuit of the top pair early, saved
ground around the bend, asked right handed approaching the stretch and faded. LITTLE DUMPLING sat off the pace, navigated the turn three then four
wide and was never a factor. THERE WAS A STEWARDS; INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START DYIN A THIRST AND SUNSET GRAZEN AND RULED
THAT BOTH RIVALS CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
WESTERN GRIT sprinted clear to show the way up the backstretch, led along the rail through the turn, kicked away entering the lane, widened to midstretch
and held safely under urging to win convincingly. BILLY JOE SHAVER traveled in mid-pack off the inside, navigated the turn four then five wide, drifted
inward midstretch and finished willingly to gain second. OCASEK sat off the pace off the rail then between foes, rounded the bend two to three wide and
kept on for a clear third. DEVILNTHEBLUEGRAS had his path taken shortly after the start, laid off the pace from outside, went five then six wide around the
turn and churned on to round out the superfecta. SUMMER CHIEF coaxed along early, tracked three wide into the turn, spun five wide into the lane and
lacked further response. MENDELSSOHNS MUSIC climbed early, chased off the pace from inside into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and failed to
menace. ST. ELIGIUS raced up close to the outside of the leader, still closest in pursuit a bit off the rail into the stretch, could not answer the call when
roused and weakened down the lane. CANDY'S WILDCAT stalked in range early then became a bit green and lost ground, raced along the rail then eased
out while starting to weaken around the bend, came four wide into the stretch and faded. L SQUARED climbed at the back early, went two wide into the
turn, eased out and came four wide into the drive, lacked room behind rivals and altered in past the eighth pole but was stymied once more and could not
regain momentum. MISCHIEVOUS DYLAN traveled near the back off the rail, went from the three path to the five path before angling inward on the bend,
went two wide into the stretch and could not make an impact. CHIRAG chased off the pace on the inside, moved out around the bend and entered the lane
in the three path but had little left for the stretch run.

CONTROL FUNCTION got put in tight along the fence and checked early, started to pull and had to steady off heels early on the clubhouse turn, trailed
under reserve up the backstretch, patiently handled a bit off the rail on the far turn, roused approaching the stretch, rallied from inside and bested PORT
ELLEN (IRE) late. PORT ELLEN (IRE) settled in the two path, moved into range on the far turn, tipped out at the quarter pole and took aim three wide
entering the stretch, challenged from outside at the eighth pole, took over midstretch, dueled with CONTROL FUNCTION late and got outkicked. STRANGE
ADDICTION had early speed inside ANKYRAH then cleared that rival to take full control, opened up while racing keenly in hand around the clubhouse turn,
held a comfortable advantage to the half-mile marker, carried a diminished lead into and around the far turn, moved out in upper stretch, clung to a short
lead at the eighth pole and yielded in deep stretch. ANKYRAH broke well then ceded command and moved inside to stalk the leader, took aim two wide
leaving the far turn, moved out further to challenge but lacked room between rivals and checked at the eight pole, altered inward but could not regain
momentum. GILA stalked the lone speed from inside in range then off the pace, crept closer in the middle stages, roused outside the quarter pole, cut the
corner into the stretch and weakened.

KEEN TO GO stalked four deep early on the clubhouse turn then moved into the two path before tipping back out leaving the bend, bid three deep with
three furlongs remaining, took over at the five-sixteenths pole, put away inner rival a quarter mile out and moved inside, opened up into the stretch and
widened under mild urging in an impressive victory. MIDNIGHT MOJO went five deep into the clubhouse turn, moved inward settling off the pace then four
wide into the backstretch, raced outside a rival at the back in the middle stages, went three deep into the far turn, moved into the two path then chased from
the three path turning for home, could not make any headway on the winner but kept on to earn the place honors. SYNTACTIC coaxed from the gate and
was sent up into a tight spot between runners, got through and pressed the pace between rivals, took over at the halfway point dueling from outside, lost
command at the five-sixteenths pole, chased after the new leader with a quarter mile remaining and flattened to third in the stretch run. BIG DRINKER
stalked from inside, lost positions up the backstretch, bumped outer rival nearing the five-sixteenths pole, tipped around a weakening rival then moved back
inside around the bend and failed to menace. SUPERMAX trailed two wide early, went between rivals leaving the backstretch, bumped with outer rival past
the seven-sixteenths pole, bumped with inner rival near the five-sixteenths pole and could not rally. SIPPIN WHISKEY raced up close three deep early,
chased the top pair past the midway point, rounded the far turn four wide and had little left for the stretch run. SPLASHED IN GOLD took control from the rail
position under pressure, lost command at the halfway point, dueled to the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back to last on the far turn, eased in the final
furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
SUNSET GLORY (IRE) broke well then raced keenly when taken in hand and ceding the early lead to LINDA'S GIFT, stalked the lone leader from the rail,
moved out a bit and took aim two on the far turn, drew alongside LINDA'S GIFT outside the eighth pole and wore down the runner-up and edged past late.
LINDA'S GIFT up close between rivals into the first turn then cleared and moved inside around the bend, opened up a comfortable advantage first time
through the stretch, held a diminished lead into the far turn, continued clear to the top of the stretch, confronted by SUNSET GLORY (IRE) entering the final
furlong, resisted to the sixteenth pole and yielded grudgingly late. MUSICAL RHAPSODY (IRE) allowed to settle at the back in the two path, saved ground
from the rail on the clubhouse turn, trailed two wide leaving the backstretch, angled out past the quarter pole and chased four deep into the stretch, could
not summon the needed rally to threaten the top pair but kept on to best the rest. SUN OF HILL (BRZ) reserved in the beginning and moved into the three
path, remained three wide to the last turn, asked outside a pair of rivals and failed to threaten. DUVET DAY (IRE) stalked three then two wide on the first
turn then dropped back out of range outside a rival, crept closer up the backstretch, chased between on the last turn and lacked a rally. FEDERALIST
PAPERS took back shortly after the start and moved inside, ridden along through the final bend and asked left handed past the quarter pole but could not
offer the needed response.

Footnotes
CLAMPETT chased from outside, went four wide into the turn, asked right handed past the quarter pole, raced in the five path turning for home, latched onto
PIPER'S CAUSEWAY in upper stretch, took over midstretch and maintained a short lead over the runner-up to the wire. PIPER'S CAUSEWAY prompted
the pace earl, headed the leader on the turn, took over at the quarter pole, put away inner rival while being confronted by CLAMPETT in upper stretch, lost
the lead midstretch and stayed on inside the winner. TRUSTY RUSTY hustled from the gate then had to take hold when running up on heels at various
points up the backstretch, entered the turn along the inside, angled out at the quarter pole and was along for the show honors. STONEVICIOUS chased
between then lost his path and dropped back to last while drifting out a bit, angled down to the inside approaching the turn, saved ground to the stretch, split
foes at the eighth pole and summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. SUNRISE JOURNEY stepped to the front and set the tone under pressure
from PIPER'S CAUSEWAY, dueled with that rival on the turn and lost command at the quarter pole, fought on to upper stretch, then weakened in the furlong
grounds. LANSDOWNE (GB) chased along the inside, came under a ride into the turn, put to right handed urging entering the lane and lacked the needed
response. RIVOLI broke in and bumped rival twice, stalked outside rivals to the turn, asked three then four wide around the bend and failed to rally.
SHASHASHAKEMEUP got bumped twice by RIVOLI in the beginning, trailed well off the rail then raced near the back into the turn, navigated the turn five
wide then raced in the six path exiting the bend and failed to menace. EL DIABLO ROJO traveled in mid-pack four deep leaving the backstretch, also took
the turn five then six wide and weakened down the lane. SOLOMONS GOLD climbed early raced towards the back, went three deep into the turn, spun five
wide into the stretch and was never a factor. PLAYING HARDBALL chased between rivals, dropped back on the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.
