Footnotes
CADFAEL was coaxed from the outside post to comfortably clear off to get to the rail setting the pace, dictated terms while alone, running in hand around
the bend, was tapped right-handed just to keep his interest on things at the seventy-yard pole and drew off convincingly for the front end score. LADY XI
was unhurried to see the field in the early stages, started to make a move three wide around rivals at the three furlong marker, loomed the only threat in the
four path in upper stretch, was no match for the dominant winner down the lane but bested the rest comfortably for the place share. COMMANDER AT SEA
had horses on both sides, tracking the frontrunner in the backside, waited behind a wall of three outside another runner through the turn, found a clear path,
opting for an inside route two wide for the drive and willingly split foes at the sixteenth pole to close in and capture third money at the wire. MEKO MAKEE
travelled three deep on the outside, watching the frontrunner down the back straight, took closer order to sit outside, just off the flank at the three eighths
marker, chased the leader in vain throughout the turn and faded between rivals in the final sixteenth. RYE'S MY GUY was on the rail with two others to his
outside, tracking the pacesetter along the backstretch, lost position while nudged on the fence around the turn, could see the field at the quarter pole and
made little impact inside in the stretch running.

Footnotes
SPEEDY ROSE rated kindly in hand while in the second flight, tracking outside down the backstretch, cruised confidently around horses three wide at the
three furlong pole, bid for the lead three wide at the top of the lane and finally when set down, drew off smartly in the final furlong for the win. SUMMER
HOLIDAY was content to trail this field along the back straight, started to wind up, bursting between foes in the two path with two furlongs to run, gathered
more momentum, swinging out to be five wide for the stretch run but was no match for the winner in the drive to the wire. SLOANS SKY settled in midfield
on the fence down the backstretch, sat just behind the leader on the fence around the turn, was boxed in on the rail at the quarter pole, rallied up the inside
in upper stretch, shifted just outside to the two path at the furlong marker and closed in smartly to get up late for the show money. FULCRA seized
command at the start on the rail, set the pace while hounded outside throughout the turn, was collared outside by a pair of rivals at the quarter pole, fought
on travelling on the fence until the furlong marker but faded late to settle on the fringes in the end. RING IT UP stalked near the rear on the outside, closed
the gap on the field at the half, was hard ridden two wide, making little progress around the bend, was pushed out, widest in the six path for the drive and
could not get involved down the lane. SHE'SACROWDPLEASER was urged outside along the backstretch, chasing the pacesetter, vied in the two path
between horses for the front at the quarter pole, could not go on with the leaders turning for home and retreated in the four path by mid-stretch.

Footnotes
TAX INCLUDED pressed the issue inside at the break, took over control on the rail into the first turn, narrowly maintained the lead down the backstretch,
was nudged along inside on the fence keeping a nose in front around the final turn, edged away for a clear lead at the eighth pole and was kept to the task
to open up at finish for the score. SO CALLED VACATION broke outwards on the start when hustled for the lead early between horses, shadowed the
pacesetter outside down the backstretch, turned up the pressure outside, dueling for the lead, bobbing heads up front in the far turn, could not go with the
winner in upper stretch and fought on to the wire to save the runners up share at the finish line. BIG SHOOTER stalked near the back, two wide into the first
turn, shared the last spot inside down the backside, took closer order when roused on the fence by the quarter pole, angled four wide for the drive and
finished with interest to get up at the wire outside for the show award. QUANDALE stumbled on the break when clipping the inside rivals heels at the start,
regrouped to have a good spot, watching the engaged pair while on the fence in the early stages, could not keep up with the leaders around the final turn
and finished up gradually between runners, gaining late but was on the losing end of a three way photo for the third place share. BLONDINA'S BOY settled
three wide at the rear outside a rival, co-trailed outside down the back straight, made no headway when asked for more on the final bend and could only
pass a tired runner in deep stretch. NIGHT STRIKER prompted the pace three wide on the outside to begin, tracked the front two outside in the second flight
down the backstretch,, inched closer, posing a threat three wide around the final turn, stalled in the four path by upper stretch and yielded to the rest of the
field in the last sixteenth of a mile. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL AND STEWARDS INQUIRY #4 QUANDALE AGAINST #3 SO CALLED VACATION AT THE

Footnotes
BUCK'S FIZZ was forwardly-placed pressing the pace of the early leader from outside, took over a narrow advantage three furlongs out, drew clear by
upper stretch when asked, was kept to the task through the lane. ASHUKA was up close briefly in the early going chasing, steadily dropped back four to five
wide heading into the turn, swung out nine then ten wide turning for home, came again to be clearly second best. HALCON NEGRO broke outwardly a bit,
stalked in behind racing off the rail after briefly attending the early pace, was encouraged a bit past the three-eighths, swung out four wide turning for home,
drifted out through the stretch, was outfinished for place. SOUPER ICONIC broke a bit awkwardly, steadily advanced outside foes five wide on the turn,
came into upper stretch seven to eight deep within range of the leaders but evened out. BOSTON BAY settled between runners at the back early, floated six
wide turning for home, ran on. CANADIAN DADDY settled off the pace inside, saved ground before moving out later on the turn shifting five wide into upper
stretch, lacked the needed late kick. INDY COWBOY set a pressured pace inside, weakened. HURRICANE DESHAMBO was in just a bit tight at the break,
raced between foes at the back, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
INFAMOUS COVERT assumed the lead with ears pricked, setting a pedestrian pace into the first turn, maintained a slim margin up top loping along down
the backside, was let out a notch at the three-furlong pole, quickly opened up on the field around the far turn and coasted home for the overpowering win.
MISTER MESEEKS had a tracking position inside runners, settled in mid-pack on the fence down the backside, waited for his cue going around the far turn,
shifted off the rail in upper stretch to be three wide with a furlong to go and found more late, getting up at the shadow of the wire for the runners up share.
MAMBOINTHEFOREST tracked outside in the early going, sensing the soft pace closed in to prompt the issue outside down the backstretch, was roused
trying to chase the winner three furlongs from home but to no avail, battled for the runners up share down the stretch but was caught late and settled for the
show money in the end. TIMESKIP was under a snug hold in the second flight with runners on both sides down the backstretch, ran evenly between rivals
making little impact on the far turn and dueled for the show award at the top of the lane but was one paced in the stretch drive. STOP THE HUMBUG had
one rival beaten into the first turn, status was unchanged down the back straight, was shuffled back to last on the fence three furlongs to go, tried to offer a
rally turning for home while two wide but lost his path in upper stretch and regrouped to offer a mild run on the fence in deep stretch. REDOUTE'S LIGHT
trailed the field in the early stages, began to mount a rally outside, picking up horses with three eighths remaining, shifted out to the five path for the stretch
run but could not reach contention in the drive to the wire. COLEYVILLE stalked three wide near the rear in the first turn, made an early move, advancing
three deep outside runners along the backside, was asked for more three wide around the final bend keeping pace with the leader, angled in the four path
turning for home but lacked a finish in the stretch running.

Footnotes
WYOMING BILL set the pace from off the rail while pressured by outside foes, kicked clear, held sway under steady handling. KING ROSSO tracked from
inside, saved ground on the turn, rode the rail into upper stretch advancing on the leader, could make no headway late but secured the place. SIDE
STREET pressed the early pace, steadied just slightly about the seven-sixteenths dropping back a bit, swung seven wide turning for home, finished well but
was not enough. TIMES A BREEZE settled outside a foe at the back after breaking a half-step slowly, swung out a bit for the drive, lost the crop in the
stretch and failed to menace. BOWMAN'S RUN stalked from outside then edged closer while keen to go on, was within range but flattened out in the drive.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF SIDE STREET AGAINST WYOMING BILL ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SHOOTIN' AMY dueled for the lead on the fence in the early going, began to edge away from the three outside challengers in midturn, spurted clear when
roused straightening out for home and was kept to the task to the wire to hold safe for the front running tally. MAGICAL TRICK tracked four deep, outside
runners along the backside watching the contesting pair, tried to circle the field four wide around the turn, angled out widest in the five path looming outside
at the top of the lane but could not match strides with the winner in mid-stretch and finished up a clear but non threatening second in the end. WILDFIRE
battled outside for the lead down the backstretch, chased the pacesetter, two wide with runners on either side through the running on the turn, shifted out to
be three wide turning for home in the mix up top in upper stretch, angled to the rail driving for the line at the furlong marker and won the show duel in deep
stretch. HOME FOR A REST was reined in to track the engaged duo while inside a rival down the backstretch, moved in to prompt the pace three wide
between horses around the turn, angled out to the four path to be in the hunt in upper stretch up front but was outkicked late and settled on the fringes at the
finish line. MASTER ARAGORN was away sluggishly on the rail to see the field along the backside, closed the margin when the compact field bunched up
at the half, could not reel in the leaders while saving ground around the bend and failed to menace running to the finish line. FAITHFUL CREEK stalked
outside, ahead of the poor starter down the back straight, co-trailed on the outside throughout the turn and failed to fire driving to the wire.

Footnotes
SILENT MIRACLE pressed the pace inside to begin, began to inch away up top by the half on the rail, gave way to an outside rival for the lead with a
quarter mile to run, resurged in the three path at the furlong pole and drifted out in the late stages, driving to the line to just hold on for the win from a closing
in runner. BLUE MAX broke out on the start, rated kindly when three deep outside foes stalking near the back, commenced a rally, circling three wide
outside, moving well around rivals in the turn, loomed boldly in the six path for the drive, battled throughout the stretch with the winner but was denied at the
finish line. LONG POND tracked four deep outside foes down the backstretch, closed in to prompt three wide through the turn, poked his head in front at the
quarter pole for a moment, relinquished the lead between horses in the five path by mid-stretch while running on the wrong lead to the wire and
determinedly saved the show award when crossing the finish line. DRAGON'S BREW sat alone, watching the contesting duo early on, lost some positioning
to track the top trio while between rivals with three furlongs to go, sat behind the leaders in the four path at the top of the lane, appeared to be stalling in
upper stretch and found another gear late to close in right at the line for a minor role. HIGHLAND SOCIETY was away alertly to have a slim lead at the start,
vied between runners in the two path down the backstretch and throughout the turn, continued to duel for a placing three wide with rivals on both sides down
the lane but faded in deep stretch, losing a placing right at the wire. KID FORESTER stalked outside, having one rival beaten down the backstretch, began
to pass horses outside midpoint on the turn, angled to be five wide when straightening out for home, shifted back inwards in the two path with a furlong to go
and had good late energy in deep stretch. RACE FOR PINKS travelled on the rail in mid-pack, sat behind the winner, a few lengths back on the fence
around the turn, was in range for a piece of the prize while inside on the rail turning for home but tired at the sixteenth pole. FORESTER HUMOR settled in
midfield while two wide between foes down the backside, was shuffled back three eighths from home, losing momentum around the bend and had little to
show for in the stretch drive. LENNY K trailed the field on the rail along the backside, was roused for more on the fence three furlongs out, offered little
response around the turn and could not be a presence three wide for the stretch drive.
