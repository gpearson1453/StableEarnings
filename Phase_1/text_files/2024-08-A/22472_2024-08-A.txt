Footnotes
STYLISH PAINT raced with the early pace then took over and showed the way into the first turn, came under pressure past the three eighths pole,
contested the far turn near the rail, drifted approaching the eighth pole but dug in determinedly to win the nod and just lasted. TIMEISGOLDEN settled off
the rail the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, entered the far turn about the three path, drifted toward the head
of the lane but dug in to take second late and just missed the nod for the win. NIGHTTIME JUSTICE saved ground close to the pace the opening turn,
hovered behind horses leaving the three eighths pole, picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths and raced at the rail on the far turn but was
outfinished in the duel through the stretch. CALYPSO GHOST stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole then faded in the
three path on the far turn. CASTLE OF CAYLEE settled back off the rail the first turn, raced wide into the backstretch and was not a factor. SALTY SAUL
raced with the early pace then stalked from the three path the first turn, challenged into the backstretch but dropped back toward the three eighths pole and
faded approaching the far turn.

ROCK ROSE angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure past the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and held well
under steady stretch handling. DIVINE FASHION settled just off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn in the three path and dug in to take second the final strides. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing
the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and dug in leaving the turn, but flattened late and was nipped from second the final strides. A LITTLE
BIT CRAZY saved early ground then gave chase from the three eighths pole, entered the far turn about the four path, drifted to the outside entering the
stretch and finished well. SOMEBODY LOVES ME saved early ground well off the pace, left the first turn outside and picked up the chase past the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened in the lane. FORTUNATA ITALIA rounded the opening turn about the four path and showed
little response through the backstretch. JACKYSINTHECASTLE settled in the three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
LONA LEE stalked the early pace two deep then challenged and dueled leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead approaching the quarter pole,
contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, drifted into the lane, lugged in under a hard left rein and right hand urging mid-stretch, but held on
well. IMPRESSIONISM saved ground off the pace, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, took aim between horses past the
eighth pole but was roughed when shut off at the inside flank of Lona Lee mid-stretch, but quickly recovered to duel for second. SHEWONTTALKTOME
rated close off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, had range in the three path on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane.
SYMPTOMATIC settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, left the turn
outside and flattened in the lane. JUMPIN JACK BRASS veered out leaving the gate and rounded the opening turn off the rail, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and showed little more. KRISTINACHRYSALIS rated a slim lead inside, was met and dueled with the
advantage leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the lead at the rail approaching the quarter, dropped back mid-way on the far turn, was roughed when
pinched back mid-stretch and gave way from there. Following a Stewards inquiry, the riders of both Kristinachrysalis and Impressionism, lodged claims of
foul against the rider of Lona Lee for interference mid-stretch, and as a result, Lona Lee was disqualified to last place.
