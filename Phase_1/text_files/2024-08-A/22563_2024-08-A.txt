Footnotes
MCLAREN VALE dueled from inside then inched ahead around the clubhouse turn, cleared outer rival with three furlongs remaining, lightly coaxed around
the far turn, roused a bit in upper stretch then flagged with the drop, drew away past the eighth pole and was in hand approaching the wire.
HARDMONEYMUCHACHOS tracked in the four path around the first turn, raced in range four wide into the second bend, was closest in pursuit three wide
entering the drive, could not make any headway on the winner in the final furlong but stayed on for a clear second. ROGUE SON brushed with outer rival
early, settled in the two path, angled to the rail for the far turn, steered back out late on the bend and was along for the show. AMERICAN CAT dueled two
wide into the first turn then pressed MCLAREN VALE from outside, could not keep pace with that rival at the three-eighths pole, chased off the rail to the
stretch and weakened. SEATTLE BREAKOUT threw his head to come away to a slow start, trailed three wide early, passed a tired rival on the far turn, spun
four wide into the lane and failed to menace. ARROGATES SPIRIT brushed with inner rival and had to pause briefly early, sat off the pace four wide early,
three deep at the half-mile pole, traveled two to three wide then got floated out into the stretch, had little left in the drive and was not persevered with.
SANGER stalked three wide then shifted over to the rail around the first turn, dropped back in the middle stages, trailed past the three-eighths pole, eased in
the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
IMA JOKER stalked in the two path, bid three deep on the far turn, dueled into the lane, disposed of inner rival in upper stretch, drew away under right
handed urging and steady handling in the last sixteenth. DEN OF INIQUITY (GB) unhurried from inside, moved into range between rivals leaving the
backstretch, spun three wide into the lane and outkicked MISS WILL for second. MISS WILL stalked along the rail, came under a ride on the far turn
continuing to save ground, tipped out a bit at the top of the lane, finished willingly but got edged for the place honors. IN YOUR LIFE grabbed the lead and
moved inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, challenged by a pair of rivals midway around the bend, fought on even terms into the lane, yielded to the
winner in upper stretch and weakened. QUEEN BERKELEY pulled and ran up on heels two wide early, traveled near the back into the far turn, gained while
easing out three then four wide but flattened in the drive. MATTERS tucked inside at the back, had to steady behind a rival into the far turn, trailed to the
stretch and failed to menace. GOD'S FAVOR raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter, bid between on the far turn, drifted out a bit between the
five-sixteenths pole and quarter pole costing her momentum, chased the top pair into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
JUBILANT JOANIE cleared and crossed over to the rail, drew away on the far turn, cornered nicely into the lane, padded the lead under hand urging and
added to the margin while in hand late. DORINE'S WILD CAT bobbled slightly leaving the gate but still came away well, unhurried after and settled at the
back in the two path, waited by rivals from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths marker, came two wide into the stretch and gained second.
DRAMATIZER raced in range on the inside to the far turn, was closest in pursuit past the five-sixteenths pole, came off the rail and entered the lane three
wide, could not summon the needed late kick in the furlong grounds and lost second. BIG HOPES forwardly placed three wide early, stayed off the rail up
the backstretch, moved out and came five wide into the lane and failed to rally. DANCE KID chased from inside near the back, traveled inside rivals into the
far turn, cut the corner into the lane and never threatened. WARRIOR LADY sat off the pace in the three path, coaxed along up the backstretch, navigated
the far turn two then three wide and came up empty. SWEET HELLO raced up close from the rail then quickly shifted to the two path early on the clubhouse
turn, angled out on the far turn and came four wide into the lane, then faded in the drive. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY tracked four wide on the clubhouse turn,
remained wide on the second bend and eased out further to entered the stretch six wide and had little left when called upon. VIOLET STORM reserved five
then four wide early, exited the backstretch three wide, trailed four wide into the lane and was never a factor.

Footnotes
PRINCESS IS OLIVIA tracked widest for a bit then went up to contest the pace five deep, battled four deep approaching the quarter pole, six wide into the
lane, took over in upper stretch, drew clear midstretch and was kept busy to the line. ACE ACE BABY bumped between rivals at the start, chased between
foes when went up to fight for the lead three deep between, vied four to five wide into the lane, fought inside PRINCESS IS OLIVIA to midstretch, then
yielded to that rival and held second. IFUAINTFIRSTURLAST broke out and bumped rival then lost her path at the start, dropped back to last, saved ground
through the turn, finished well in the lane and missed second. SABRES brushed with ACE ACE BABY at the start, chased off the pace well off the rail then
angled in for the turn, eased over to the two path around the bend, swung out approaching the stretch and finished willingly for a minor award. KYTHIRA
chased briefly then moved up while bumping with inner rival, pressed between foes to the turn, took over at the five-sixteenths marker, came three wide into
the lane, lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened. UNIFIED A. P. coaxed from the gate on the inside then tried to move up to press the pace but got put
in tight, bumped and checked near the half-mile pole, gained along the rail around the bend, then flattened out in the final furlong. LITTLE LADY LOU
coaxed along early giving chase then vied four deep between foes to the turn, lost ground around the bend and drifted out seven wide, then came up empty
in the lane. ENVISIONED hard to load behind the gate, was off alertly but also broke outward, took control early then got pressure by several runners,
drifted out a bit around the bend and relinquished the lead at the five-sixteenths pole, chased the new leader into the lane and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
NELL'S LEGACY bumped leaving the gate, went up to duel from outside, inched clear around the turn, drew away in upper stretch and padded the margin
under urging then was in hand near the wire. GRAZEN GATOR broke a step slow, moved inside racing towards the rear, advanced inside then angled out
midway around the bend, ran into traffic at the quarter pole, came back to the inside, summoned a mild rally in the lane and gained second. ORANGE
THUNDER chased under coaxing from inside, tipped out into the lane and got outkicked for the place honors. ON TIME TAM raced in range between foes,
got crowded and steadied past the three-eighths pole, got forced out and had his path taken again while bumping with outer rival midway around the bend.
ANTHONY'S SPICE went up to duel from inside, fought with the winner to the quarter pole, could not keep up and chased that rival into the lane and
weakened. ABBEY THEATRE broke in and bumped, raced up close outside the top pair, chased four then three wide around the bend before drifting out
into the stretch and also weakened. MRAZEK'S OLD DREAM off slow in the beginning, trailed to the turn, hand to take up and alter out from behind trouble
rivals, angled down to the inside and could not make an impact. LUNAR RIDE sat off the pace, went three wide into the turn, got floated out early on the
bend then got bumped and forced out shortly after, steered back inward and chased two wide into the lane but could not be a factor. JUST A LITTLE CYNN
tracked three deep early, took the turn two to three wide and faded in the lane. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT ON THE TURN,
THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH GRAZEN GATOR DID COME OUT AND IMPEDE ON TIME TAM, THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A
DISQUALIFICATION.

Footnotes
BE PUNCTUAL pulled early near the inside behind the leaders, followed the top pair to the far turn, tipped out and launched a bid leaving the far turn, took
over while drifting out in upper stretch and maintained a short advantage over the runner up in the final sixteenth. SILVER N BLACK pressed the pace from
outside, headed the leader at the quarter pole, fought between foes approaching the stretch, lost touch with BE PUNCTUAL in upper stretch, then stayed on
well from inside to draw alongside again but lacked the needed late kick to go by. IT'S MY WORLD chased between rivals then lugged out and had to check
early on the first turn, chased out of range off the rail up the backstretch, angled in on the far turn then moved back out to race three wide into the drive and
gained the show honors. TOPPERS WAGER forwardly placed in the three path around the first turn, stayed off the rail stalking the leaders up the
backstretch, moved out and came five wide into the drive and weakened. BART SIP SOME showed the way early under pressure from outer rival, held a
short lead to the far turn, headed with quarter mile remaining, fought inside a pair of rivals into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened.
RAZEN THE STAKES traveled three wide at the back into the first turn then got forced out wide around the bend, coaxed along near the back up the
backstretch, went four wide into the turn, moved into the three path then came back out to enter the lane five wide and failed to menace. CODY BOY
chased from inside then started to pull into the first turn, lugged out then started to climb around the bend, continued in an awkward stride in hand early on
the backstretch, trailed on the inside around the second bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE showed brief speed between rivals then chased up the backstretch, bid two wide at the three-eighths pole, took over at the
quarter pole, cleared leaving the bend, put to right handed urging past the eighth pole and padded the margin late. SHARP RIDE broke well then was
allowed to settle off the pace, moved into range along the inside leaving the backstretch, eased off the fence and spun three wide into the drive and bested
the rest. NO CAP vied for the lead from inside, ceded command leaving the backstretch, had to steady behind a rival and lacked room in traffic to the
stretch, tipped out and kept on for a clear third. WHIMSICAL HEIR broke inward, sat off the pace, went three wide into the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and improved position. FLY A FANTASY trailed up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, cut the corner into the lane and improved
position. T N T NOVA bumped hard in the beginning, tracked the pace from outside, drew closer three then four wide around the bend but flattened out in
the drive. BABY KRISTEN vied outside a pair of rivals then inched ahead to take control, cleared inner rival at the seven-sixteenths pole, took pressure from
the winner around the bend, lost command at the quarter pole and folded. SWEET VENGEANCE got pinballed in the early going, raced near the back in the
three path leaving the backstretch, raced five wide turning for home and could not make an impact. ICONIC SKY broke out and bumped SWEET
VENGEANCE, chased off the rail then between rivals up the backstretch, navigated the turn two to three wide and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
ZIP OM broke inward to lose a step, stalked the top pair off the rail, took aim two wide into the stretch, drew alongside the leader and took over at the eighth
pole, drove clear quickly and won going away. DANZING FOREST dueled from inside, inched ahead leaving the backstretch, put away outer rival at the
quarter pole, confronted by ZIP OM in upper stretch, yielded to that rival and kept on for a clear second. RED ON SUNDAY stalked from inside, hugged the
rail to the stretch, could not produce the needed rally but held the show. CAPITAL OUTLAY fractious in the gate, brushed outer rival in the beginning,
chased outside a rival out of range into the turn, navigated the bend two wide, moved out in the lane and could not rally. THE SCENT off slow in the
beginning, raced between rivals at the back then moved inside, made some progress from the fence on the turn, ran into mild traffic in upper stretch and
could not rally once in the clear. MINING DISTRICT off slow leaving the gate, traveled inside rivals at the back then lagged behind into the turn, saved
ground to the stretch, came off the rail and improved position. TROTSKY took a bump from CAPITAL OUTLAY in the beginning, raced four then three deep
at the back, rounded the bend in the three path and failed to menace. SON O' SANPETE chased three deep then two wide between rivals off the pace,
remained two wide to the stretch and was never a factor. REMI OR NOT away quickest and went up to challenge for command outside a rival, lost contact
with inner rival with a quarter mile remaining and retreated down the lane.
