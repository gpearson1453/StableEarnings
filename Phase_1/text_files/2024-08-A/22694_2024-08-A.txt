IMPERATIVE between horses to turn never far back rallied along no match. KOBE BEACH galloped along to the turn inside, angled out for show spot.
FAVORABLE RETURN slow stride inside, urged to the quarter pole leveled off stretch. CAJUN CRACKER inside speed to the front led to eighth pole,
flattened out late. MANSION PARTY chased pace to quarter pole, gave in readily stretch run. CONSTITUTION COAL never menaced throughout.
