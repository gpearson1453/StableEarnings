BIZ BABE sent for early speed, led the way into the lane, and held safely. ZIP IT WRIT vied inside for the early lead, shifted outside, chased through the
stretch, and closed well. ALLURING ALI fanned three wide into the far turn, and lacked a closing response. MAKALEI BEACH hurried away, dropped back
to trail the field in the far turn, and passed tiring rival. BIZNESS ACCOUNT lagged early and offered a late mild bid. ITALIAN GRIZ chased the early
pacesetters and tired. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of ZIP IT WRIT against the rider of BIZ BABE alleging interference from the
runaway from the gate was not allowed.

MOHAYMEN DAY reserved off the early pacesetters, drove four wide at the head of the lane, and won driving. LIGHT FAST FEET rated off the pace while
three wide, contested the front inside of MOHAYMEN DAY, and was outkicked. JOY IN GRACE jostled away, took closer order into the final turn, and
closed with energy. TEXAS TIDELANDS allowed to settle off the pacesetters from the rail, lodged a bid and flattened late stretch. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY
bumped leaving, and failed to threaten. SMILIN EVIE set the early pace and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
NASAS PRINCESS was quickest to the turn, drew clear in the final turn, and held under a late drive. SEATTLE STING angled down to the four path leaving
the backstretch, came under urging at the head of the stretch, surged in the final yards and missed. POCKETFULOFDREAMS was outsprinted to the turn,
chased along the rail and held off a late threat for show. WRIT IN STONE closed belatedly missing out on third. ASDEVOTED brushed away from the gate,
fanned four wide and came up empty in the drive. TANGO FOR THE SOUL showed little. IT'S A GOLD AFFAIR brushed leaving, was five wide into the far
turn, and lacked a bid. HABADABADOO hurried away, and tired.

NO MORE LIES sent for speed outside, drew clear in the far turn, responded to a challenge from KITTY HOUSE in the stretch and won going away. KITTY
HOUSE sat in striking distance, moved up menacingly at the eighth pole but was unable to stall the winner and finished clearly second best. MAMA'S
QUEEN unhurried early and showed interest late. NO REJOYCE offered a late bid. OKI saved ground inside, and faded gradually through the stretch. MY
SOCKS ROCK away last, and offered a late mild bid. H K MIMI failed to threaten. THAT LITTLE LADY outrun throughout.

TUCKER TIME jostled leaving the gate, advanced quickly outside in the far turn, brushed ROCKTILLYOUDROP, closed outside and was along just in time.
EXAMINER tracked five wide, advanced inside in the final turn, shifted off the rail at the top of the stretch, and was outfinished. ROCKTILLYOUDROP sat in
range while four wide, drifted out into TUCKER TIME, lost his path , then checked entering the stretch, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and
was along with time for show honours. LIL ZAPPER sat just off the pace while four wide, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, and flattened out in the
stretch. LANNY MAC brushed leaving, and saved to no avail. A MAN'S MAN moved up between foes to press the pace, and came up empty in the drive.
BEHIND THE CURTAIN set the early pace, was overtaken and retreated. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch but
made no change after review of the films.

Footnotes
TENDER LOVE prompted the pace while four wide, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, swept the lead nearing the quarter pole, and kicked away
when given her cue. OOPS (GB) bumped hard leaving then trailed the field, shifted out four wide nearing the eighth pole, dueled for second and inched up
to earn second. PARZANNI stalked the pacesetters while five wide, was worn down through the drive for place. SIZZLIN ROSE showed the way when
leaving the chute, contested the lead from the rail, and faded in the stretch. CINNAMON SAINT vied for the early lead from between foes, was unable to
move on with rivals and faded. ISLA VIEW broke sharply, was allowed to settle then was gapped, and passed tiring rivals. RUN MYA RUN bumped leaving,
and offered little. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL bumped away from the gate, chased inside and tired early.

Footnotes
THALES tracked four to five wide, was asked to quicken in the final turn, rallied outside of LINCHPIN STORM and edged away. LINCHPIN STORM chased
four to five wide leaving the backstretch, took over nearing the quarter pole, and lacked the rally needed late. CHASE THE SUN sat just off the pace, rallied
into the stretch and lacked the kick that was needed. DRINKING AGAIN rated off the pace while three to four wide, and lacked a closing response. DON'T
LET ME DOWN offered a late mild bid. ZICATELA chased four wide leaving the backstretch, and failed to threaten in the drive. BON PRIX sent for early
speed, was overtaken nearing the final turn, and stopped. DOC COPE outrun throughout.

Footnotes
AMUSING WAY contended the pace while three wide, was under pressure nearing the stretch and stayed clear under handling. ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE)
stalked the pacesetters, closed gradually and held on for place. A LATE ONE chased from the rail early, swung wide into the lane, closed steadily outside
and narrowly missed. WYE CROSS rallied belatedly. PUMP THE BRAKES flashed early speed, was unable to keep pace with the field and yielded.
RUNNINFORCOVER chased four wide leaving the backstretch, was carried out in the final turn and offered a mild interest late. JULIUS THE GREAT
fractious in the gate, attended the pace while five wide, and came up empty late. BRATTON wide in the backstretch, angled down to the three path to
contest the front, and tired soon after.
