Footnotes
FRASER LANDING vied for the lead from the inside of WHEN IN MEXICO entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, got
the better of his pace rival midway through the final turn and repelled the bid from HORATIO in mid stretch to prevail. HORATIO away alertly and tracked
the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn while awaiting room, tipped off the
rail entering the lane, and closed determinedly late to prove second best. BECKETT'S BEST stalked the pace from the back of a compact field entering the
backstretch, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to get up for a share. WHEN IN MEXICO broke
sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of FRASER LANDING entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and
into the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival leaving the turn, and faded in the late going.

MONEYSHOT away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch, maintained his
advantage through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened while being kept to task. WESTMINSTER broke sharply and stalked the leader into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, launched his bid two wide entering the final turn to take up the chase, and finished from along the inside in
deep stretch to prove easily second best. BLUEGRASS LENT away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, was
unable to keep tabs on the pacesetter while racing two wide into the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. STATION ONE
settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished three wide in
the drive while unable to improve his position. RHUMBABA settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied two out from
the rail entering the final turn, but needed more late when called upon.

PENALTY TO RANGERS broke sharply and raced to an uncontested lead from along the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage in the run
down the backside, maintained an insurmountable lead through the final turn, and held MERRY BLUE safely at bay late under confident handling. MERRY
BLUE away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, commenced her bid two wide
entering the final turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail in the drive to prove easily second best. B C CHRISTIE away alertly, but was taken in hand
and allowed to settle well off the early pacesetter entering the backstretch, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the
rail in the drive to garner a share. PETERSON LANDING lagged well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, saved
ground while commencing her bid entering the final turn, and finished with some late interest three wide in the drive. VISENYA lagged well back early while
trailing the field into the backstretch, continued to save ground throughout, but failed to make a late impact.

FORT LANGLEY stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the
backstretch, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn and took control entering the lane, and held GOOD BYE PUTIN safely at bay late to prove best.
GOOD BYE PUTIN unhurried early while trailing the field through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, continued to bide his time at the
back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly four wide entering the final turn, and closed steadily three out from the rail in the drive to
prove second best. BETTER TONE settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, held his position in the run
down the backside, rallied smartly two wide from between rivals through the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to garner a share. MY
COLLEGE FUND settled off the early pace while racing three out from the rail through the stretch the first time, continued with a wide trip in the run down
the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished with some late interest four wide in the drive. ASKMENOQUESTIONS away alertly
and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn to grab
the lead, was overtaken leaving the turn, and outfinished late. SOMTHING ELUSIVE broke sharply and stalked the early pacesetter while saving ground at
the rail through the stretch the first time, held his position in the run down the backside, but faded over the final furlong. DYNAMITER away well and raced to
the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch, but began to weaken entering the final
turn, and had nothing to offer late.

BROKE AN BROKEN away well and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained his position in the run

POINT away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a moderate pace in the run down the backstretch,
maintained his lead through the final turn, and just failed to last. FRANKIE MACHINE stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the
stretch the first time, held his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to
get up for a share. READY HERO unhurried early while dropping back to trail, continued to bide his time at the back of the pack entering the backside,
rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest five wide in the drive. YOU DON'T OWN ME broke sharply and tracked the leader
through the stretch the first time while under snug restraint, continued from a tracking trip in the run down the backside and into the final turn, but weakened
over the final furlong. ROOKIE YEAR settled off the early pace while racing two wide through the stretch the first time, continued well off the leaders in the
run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid when called upon.

ICE BREAKER settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, took
the narrowest of leads into the lane, and prevailed over a stubborn CALA'S HONOR in deep stretch. CARLA'S HONOR away alertly and stalked the early
pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, and battled willingly from
along the rail in the drive in a game effort. TEXAS HUMOR away well, but was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the early pace while racing just out
from the rail in the run down the backstretch, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, shifted four wide leaving the turn, and closed willingly three
out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. LUCY TREASURE tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, steadied
briefly when in tight quarters approaching the final turn, rallied three wide entering the final turn, was jostled from between rivals entering the lane, but
needed more late. STAR FINALITY broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the
backside and into the final turn, began to tire leaving the turn while drifting off the rail, and had little left for the drive. AMANDA stalked the early pace while
saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, shifted off the rail midway through the turn, took
up when losing her path entering the lane and bumping with a rival to her outside, and wasn't persevered with late. BAKZONE broke in at the start while
bumping with ANIMA, settled off the early pace while racing three out from the rail entering the backstretch, was wide throughout, and failed to seriously
menace. ANIMA was bumped solidly in the opening strides and trailed the field into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, was always well
back and failed to make an impact. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of AMANDA lodged a claim of foul against
the rider of STAR FINALITY, for alleged interference entering the lane. After review the rider's claim of foul was disallowed, but the stewards disqualified
LUCY TREASURE from fourth and placed this horse 6th.
