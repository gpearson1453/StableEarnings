Footnotes
SMARTY ALEX was allowed to settled near the back while saving ground around the first turn then steadily advanced through the final turn then angled out
to three wide in upper stretch and drew off. PEPPER JACK hopped at the start and trailed the field down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final
turn but had traffic at the quarter pole, angled out to four wide at the eighth pole to make the late rally for the place. GUITARTUITION PLZZ went to the front
to co-lead from the inside until he was overtaken by the late closing SMARTY ALEX but kept on to save the show. RIPITTOTHERIGHT co-led from the two
wide to upper stretch and was overtaken at the eighth pole and weakened. RUN ROCKET raced in the middle of the pack from the two path then moved out
to three wide in upper stretch but was not a factor. SABER RUN chased the leaders from two or three wide but was not a threat.

TAYSOM pressed the pace from three wide while matching strided outside of J'S LITTLE MAN and DEEP STATED to the eighth pole then inched away and
fended off the late closing RUN SMITTY RUN to hold on for the win. RUN SMITTY RUN stalked the pace from four wide down the backstretch then
launched a bid at the three furlong marker but couldn't run down the leader and was second best. DEEP STATE vied for the lead from the inside while
matching strides with J'S LITTLE MAN and TAYSOM to the eighth pole but was outfinished by RUN SMITTY RUN but kept on for the show. J'S LITTLE
MAN rushed up to take a pressured lead from between DEEP STATE and TAYSOM while matching strides to the eighth pole but gave way late. WINGS
FOR ENO raced off the pace for the first quarter then dropped back. TEXAS TURBINE hopped slightly at the start then moved between horses at the half
mile marker but was never a threat.

MUCHO BUENO was allowed to settle on the inside down the backstretch then moved out to three wide at the half mile marker and moved up around the
turn, angled out to four wide to make a late rally, shifted in to the two path in mid stretch and cleared late for the win. THISGUYCANFLY raced in the middle
of the pack to the final turn then made a four wide bid on the final turn to engage the leader at the quarter pole and drove past to take a clear lead at the
eighth pole but was run down and caught in the final yards. GO BROTHER GO was forwardly place while saving ground on the inside around the final turn
then moved between horses at the eighth pole to finish strong to miss the place. BIG TAP BABY raced in the middle of the pack from two wide to the final
turn then moved up but had traffic near the quarter pole, shifted out to three wide in the stretch to make the late gain for show. KINGPRIN raced off the pace
from the two path, engaged the leader at the quarter pole but lacked the late response. LITTLE WARRIOR was unhurried down the backstretch then made
a mild four wide bid at the half mile marker and passed tired ones in the stretch. DEE'S LEGS rushed away to a clear lead to the final turn then was eclipsed

Footnotes
MID WEST FUN raced near the back down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker, tipped out to five wide in upper stretch
and ran down the leaders to clear late. CLEARLY CREEPS stumbled at the start, settled in the middle of the pack then made a four wide bid at the half mile
marker and drove past the leaders at the quarter pole to take a brief narrow lead but was outkicked late. FAYE L. raced off the pace on the backstretch then
moved up from three wide at the half mile marker and engaged the leader at the quarter pole, fought gamely in the stretch but was outfinished. LEXI'S
FURY prompted the pace from the inside to the turn then fell back on the turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. INEZ was forwardly placed early then
made a mild bid on the turn but lacked the late response. BITSY'S DOUBLE DAY showed good early speed to press the pace to the top of the stretch while
fighting gamely to the eighth pole and tired late. OUR INDIAN GIRL trailed the field and was outrun. DISCREET DEAL went to a pressured lead to the three
furlong marker and inched away but was collared quickly at the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
WANNA WINNA had to steady leaving the gate and trailed around the first turn, steadily advanced through the final turn then moved between horses at the
three sixteenths pole to take command and drew clear. MOKINGS raced within striking distance from the two path then angled out to four wide at the eighth
pole but was outkicked by the late closer. LITTLE ROCKY tracked the leaders from the two path to the final turn then moved between horses going into the
final turn, shifted back inside to make a rail bid in upper stretch but was outfinished. SUMMER LOVER stalked the pace from three wide through the final
turn, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. CREME DE BALI broke outward leaving the gate, rushed to a clear lead but was
collared at the eighth pole and weakened. BRIARTOWN saved ground to no avail. SHADY GRADY raced off the pace while saving ground to the final turn
and retreated. BOBBY JR. was unhurried and trailed the field while being outrun.

LOVE OF MY HEART raced within striking distance from the three path, moved up around the turn to engage the leader past the quarter pole and drove
past to prove best. IZEONPOINT broke inward leaving the gate then moved to contention at the half mile marker and continued to move up on the inside to
make the late gain in the stretch to be second best. YOLANDA WHO rushed up the rail to take the lead at the five furlong marker and edged away through
the turn but was caught at the three sixteenths pole to be best of the rest. NAVAGATIONALBEACON broke well then settled in the three path through the
turn, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch to make a late run to improve position. SCRAPBOOK sprinted away from the gate to press the pace early then
chased the leader around the turn and tired. FRIED ASPARAGUS was pinched at the start then moved between horses at the half mile marker but was
never a factor. HOT SPRINGS BLING broke outward leaving the gate then vied for the lead from three wide to the three furlong marker and gave way.

Footnotes
CHARLIE'S GAL was allowed to settle down the backstretch then moved up from three wide on the final turn but had traffic in upper stretch, tipped out to
four wide at the eighth pole and made a late surge for the win. DOMINA raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail, made a middle move on the
backstretch, angled out to three wide around the final turn then moved out to four wide in upper stretch to take the lead near the sixteenth pole but was
nipped at the wire. UTSIRA was bumped by SCAMPERING MA'AM leaving the gate, raced five wide into the first turn then settled near the back down the
backstretch, moved between horses at the quarter pole but had traffic in upper stretch and angled out to five or six wide in the stretch to make the late rally
for show. CHARMING LEAH stalked the pace from three wide down the backstretch then moved up to engage the leader at the three furlong marker, took
the brief lead at the eighth pole but was caught at the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. MRS. MACOMBER raced in the middle of the pack from
three wide and passed tiring rivals. INDIAN SPIRIT went to the front to duel for the lead inside of NIGHT TIZZY to the three furlong marker then edged away
but was collared in upper stretch and was empty in the drive. NIGHT TIZZY broke through the gate prior to the start then hustled away to duel for the lead
outside of INDIAN SPIRIT to the three furlong marker and fought gamely to mid stretch and weakened. SCAMPERING MA'AM broke outward leaving the
gate and trailed the field to the final turn, made a rail bid but ran into traffic in upper stretch but kept on to improve position. REINA'S VISION raced off the
pace while saving ground to the eighth pole and tired. RADIANT REBEL tracked the leaders from four or five wide to the final turn and gave way.
