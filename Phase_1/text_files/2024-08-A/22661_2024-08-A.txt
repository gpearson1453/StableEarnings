Footnotes
A MILLION MOONS sprinted away from the gate, pressed the pace from two wide to the turn then took command near the three furlong marker and was
kept to task in the stretch drive. BIG NICKEL chased the top two to the quarter pole then angled out to three wide and fought gamely down the stretch but
couldn't collar the winner but proved second best. AMPITUP showed good early speed under pressure from A MILLION MOONS to the turn then weakened
slightly but stayed on to be the best of the rest. REXINATOR saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack to midway through the turn then tipped out
to the two path going into the stretch and made a late gain for the show. UNINSPIRED bumped by FRIENDLY HINT at the start then raced near the back,
angled out to three wide in upper stretch and passed tired ones. MAGNOLIA WEST hopped outward at the start then saved ground throughout but was
never a factor. FRIENDLY HINT broke inward and bumped UNINSPIRED at the start then trailed the field early, rushed up four wide into the turn then
shifted inside on the turn but failed to sustain the bid and tired.

Footnotes
A MILLION STARS lunged at the start then stalked the pace around the first turn then moved up the rail to be off the pace going into the final turn, moved
between horses in upper stretch to take the lead at the eight pole and was able to fend off the late closing rivals. NOW NOW MAN was allowed to settle
near the back down the backstretch then saved ground around the final turn, angled out to four wide in upper stretch and made the late rally for the place.
SENATOR CON vied for the lead from three wide around the first turn then settled off the pace down the backstretch, fell back around the final turn and had
traffic at the eighth pole, shifted out to midtrack for the late run and finished strong. I'M D'CAT was unhurried down the backstretch then saved ground on
the final turn and made a rail bid in the stretch but was outfinished. HOT LE ROY pressed the pace from two wide down the backstretch then engaged the
leader midway through the final turn to take the lead in upper stretch but was overtaken at the eighth pole and gave way. COCAL was off slow then raced in
the middle of the pack but was not a threat. CALIBRACHOA KID rushed up to take the lead to midway through the final turn then was headed, fought
gamely to the eighth pole and was done.

WHERE'S AUNT J hustled to a clear lead to the turn then was headed midway through the turn and dueled inside of SHE BADGER to the eighth pole, dug
back in to draw clear late. SHE BADGER raced off the pace on the inside to the turn then moved between horses at the three furlong marker and dueled
outside of WHERE'S AUNT J to the eighth pole but was outkicked late. CECE WAVE raced near the back down the backstretch, moved between horses at
the three furlong marker and tipped out to four wide in upper stretch to give a late kick to be up for show. GYPSYROSELEE broke well, prompted the pace

the three furlong marker and shifted back inside at the eighth pole but was not a threat. LITTLE Z trailed the field early the rushed up the rail to be off the

TIZ FABULOUS rushed to the front to set the pace, edged away on the turn and held well in the stretch. CADILLAC COWBOY raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside then angled out to four wide in upper stretch and finished strong to be second best. CATCHEM IF YOU CAN was away alertly then vied
for the lead from four wide to the turn then tipped in to two wide on the turn but lacked a late response. DRAG MALIBU tracked the leaders from the two
path to the top of the stretch then angled out to four wide in upper stretch and made a belated rally to improve position. YES JACK prompted the pace from
two wide to the turn then matched strides outside of COUNTRY CAT JACK to mid stretch but was outkicked by CADILLAC COWBOY and DRAG MALIBU
that were closing late. COUNTRY CAT JAKE pressed the pace from the inside to the turn then matched strides inside of YES JACK to mid stretch and was
out finished. GABARRA broke through the gate prior to the start, was void of speed and not a threat. CORKED raced in the middle of the pack from three
wide to the turn and retreated. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate
time.

Footnotes
BLACK ACE prompted the pace from three wide then engaged the leader at the three furlong marker and took the lead midway through the turn, drew clear
and held. FUNTIMEGIRL raced near the back to the turn then moved up between horses near the quarter pole, tipped out to three wide in upper stretch to
make the late rally to prove second best. CRANKY SHEILA stalked the pace from four wide to the turn then from three wide around the turn but couldn't
catch the leader and was outfinished by FUNTIMEGIRL that was closing late. LITTLE BURRITO raced off the pace from the inside but failed to menace.
SMARTY'S ANGEL roused to a clear lead to the turn then was headed by BLACK ACE near the three furlong marker but kept on to the quarter pole before
fading. KAYLEE'S SHADOW stumbled leaving the gate and was outrun. CREAM PUFF REAPER hopped at the start then was used early and tired.

REV TOO raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground down the backstretch then moved up from two wide on the final turn, shifted in at the top of
the stretch but had traffic at the eighth pole and had to shift out to three wide at the sixteenth pole and dug in to be up in the final jump to win the photo.
NORTH OF BALI tracked the leaders from two wide through the turn then moved up and split horses at the three sixteenths pole to take the lead past the
eighth pole but was nipped at the wire and lost the photo. SLEW SKIES pressed the pace from two wide to the turn then took a narrow lead near the three
furlong marker but was collared at the eighth pole and yielded grudgingly. STAR BYFAR raced off the pace from the inside down the backstretch then fell
back on the turn but made a late rail bid in the stretch to improve position. SIR LANCELOT RIDGE was unhurried down the backstretch then moved up from
three wide around the final turn, tipped out to six wide in upper stretch to make a belated bid. I AM ON THE LIST was off slow and raced near the back
around the first turn then steadily advanced and closed well. MY STORY raced five wide into the first turn, was forwardly placed down the backstretch then
retreated. TWO WEEKS NOTICE was reluctant to load into the starting gate, vied for the lead from three wide then two wide on the final turn and fought
gamely to mid stretch but was outfinished. LOUISIANA BARGAIN was always back. DUE WE DARE was restless in the gate then stalked the pace from
three wide around the first turn then moved to contention from four wide at the three furlong marker and challenged leaders to the top of the stretch and
faded. JUSTINS SECRET had the brier early foot on the first turn then vied for the lead on the inside to the final turn and gave way.

Footnotes
GHOST COWBOY vied for the lead to the half mile marker then took the lead near the seven sixteenths pole, inched away on the turn and drew off in the
stretch to prove best. FLAT OUT RUNNER raced near the back down the backstretch then gained ground around the turn, angled out to four wide at the
quarter pole, shifted to the inside at the eighth pole but was not match for the winner and was second best. SAMSPLAYERSLOUNGE pressed the pace to
the quarter pole, floated out in upper stretch and finished evenly. ALL SAINTS raced near the back but bobbled and drifted out near the half mile marker but
made a late run in the stretch to improve position. WINDTAPPER WIN failed to menace. PINCH HITTER saved ground while making a challenge for the
lead on the turn but was empty. GUTZY went to a pressured lead to the turn and fought gamely to the quarter pole but tired. LONE STAR MAX trailed the
field and was not involved.
