Footnotes
SHE'S KIND OF HOT away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of
WEEKENDINDELMAR in the run down the backside, opened a clear advantage through the final turn, and continued to widen her lead late under confident
handling. WEEKENDINDELMAR broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of SHE'S KIND OF HOT in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival through the turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to prove easily second best. BABY I'M A
STAR steadied sharply when put in tight quarters at the rail approaching the first turn, and ended up settling well off the early leaders, rallied along the
inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive to pick up a share. SWEET LILY was slow into stride while trailing the field into
the first turn, was always well back and finished two wide in the drive. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of BABY
I'M A STAR lodged a claim of foul against the rider of SHE'S KINDA HOT for alleged interference entering the first turn. After review, the stewards upheld
the claim of foul, and SHE'S KINDA HOT was disqualified from first and placed third

Footnotes
COBRA JET away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside, shook clear of
his pace rival through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened in the lane while being kept to task. RING OF KERRY broke sharply and tracked the
pacesetter into the first turn while in tight quarters at the rail, maintained his trip in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and closed
determinedly from along the rail in the drive to get up for the place. EYE BE SEEING YOU away well and stalked the pace two wide from the back of a
compact field, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed belatedly four wide in the drive to get up for a share. Y VEE R hopped at the
start, but recovered quickly to press the pacesetter two wide into the first turn, continued to force the pace to the final turn, but was outfinished late.
ANOTHER GUINNESS tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon.

QUEEN OF ATTITUDE trailed the field into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched her bid with a powerful four wide move entering the
final turn, swept to the lead entering the lane and drew clear late to prove best. NINE OCLOCK CEASER away alertly and raced to the lead from along the
rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of INDYETTA in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was no match for her
stablemate entering the lane, but finished well one out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. WANDALITA away well and was allowed to
settle off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly two out from
the rail in the drive to hold on for a share. INDYETTA tracked the leader through the first turn while saving ground at the rail, tipped off the rail to force the
issue two wide in the run down te backside and into the final turn, but was outfinished in the late going. QUALITY COMMAND stalked the leaders in the run
down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact when called upon. C C SUNRISE broke sharply and
stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, but weakened over
