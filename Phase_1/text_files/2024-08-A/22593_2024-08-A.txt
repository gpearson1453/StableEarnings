Footnotes
SPORTS FOR WOMEN was never far back then was passed by GOOD JOB JACKIE after six furlongs, chased that one to the stretch then closed with a
rush in the drive to win a desperate nod. GOOD JOB JACKIE was unhurried for five furlongs, rallied to the lead, pushed clear, remained clear and
responded in the stretch but was nailed on the line. SASSY EINSTEIN was slow into stride and trailed, closed the gap on the backside the second time but
could not threaten the top two. ROSES FOR SUZZETT set the pace for six furlongs then was overtaken and faded. SENSATIONAL CITY chased the pace
while saving ground, stopped after six furlongs then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
TAVERNELLE stalked the leaders, rallied to the front after three furlongs, responded on the second turn and drew away. LORD OF LIGHT dueled for the
lead from the rail to the second turn, was no match for the winner's bid but had enough to hold the place. GOOD FOCUS trailed to the backstretch then
moved up to the second turn, shifted out into the stretch but finished evenly in the drive. SENOR FABULOSO was four wide early, settled then was roused
three wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. TIZ CURLY JOE saved ground to no avail. LUCCA'S LEGACY hustled to contest the pace, was
two wide but weakened after three furlongs.

Footnotes
FEATHER INTHE WIND had the best speed and relaxed on the lead, responded when roused on the far turn and edged away in the drive. HERE'S THE
THING pressed the pace from rail, briefly checked around the three eighths then continued to press the winner to the stretch and held second. AIRKITA had
no speed and was well wide, circled five then six wide on the far turn and finished willingly. CHIEFS LIL PEARL had no speed, got fanned four then five
wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. BETHEL RIDGE was mid pace while saving ground for three eighths then came up empty in the
drive. JADED SECRETS chased the pace two wide but gave way after a half mile.

Footnotes
LIVE A GOOD LIFE was on the pace from the outset, battled BOB'S SNIPER hand, boot and whip through the length of the stretch and inched to the front
late. BOB'S SNIPER disputed the pace inside the winner, battled determinedly through the lane but was outkicked late. RHODIUM RUNNER got
outsprinted, chased three wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. QUICK FINISH was crowded shortly after the start and took back then
had no speed in the two path and never threatened. MYSTIC WOOD FORCE chased the leaders from the rail for a half mile then came up empty. BIG BAD
BRIAN was in tight nearing the first turn from between horses, took back then gave way on the backstretrch.
