Footnotes
TEXT ME UP travelled on the rail in midfield, began to edge closer when the fence opened up at the half, sat a few lengths behind the leader on the far turn,
angled to the three path for the drive, was gaining under left handed encouragement at the furlong pole and was relentless in deep stretch to get up a few
strides before the finish for the win. SYSTEMATIC assumed command into the first turn, was unchallenged slowing the pace down along the backside,
opened up on rivals chasing through the far turn, began to get leg weary by mid-stretch while being urged for more and was caught a few jumps before the
wire. UMNEYAAT stalked near the rear in the two path, began to pass foes inside at the half, split foes smartly gathering speed by the quarter pole, shifted
to be four wide at the top of the stretch and had a good late finish to close in and get up for the third money. ALBERTA BE MINE tracked just outside in the
first turn, kept a close eye on the pacesetter three wide down the backside, was scrubbed on to keep up when beside the eventual winner through the final
turn and weakened in the lane for a minor role in the end. BUTTERED TOAST was unhurried to trail in the beginning, still galloped along seeing the field
down the back straight and passed tired runners outside in the stretch running. LIZZIES GIRL stalked three wide outside in the early stages, made a brief
run three wide outside foes from the three furlong marker until the top of the stretch but continue the run and showed little in the stretch drive. TRIZZEL
TRAZZEL settled on the rail behind the pacesetter in the first bend, continued to watch the leader while shifting just outside in the two path at the half, was
roused between foes when the pace quickened at the three furlong pole, offered little response and emptied out on the fence at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
BANKINGONAMIRACLE broke in at the start, emerged from the pack to have a clear lead at the five eighths marker, was headed outside briefly at the
quarter pole, spurted away from that foe in upper stretch and drew off even more when set down in the final furlong. SUMMER BUCK was brushed outside
on the start, stalked near the rear between foes down the backstretch, was asked midturn and began to extend her stride splitting foes in the three path by
the quarter pole, shifted out to the four path at the top of the lane and stubbornly won the duel for second money in a tight photo. SOUTHERN STYLE was
brushed outside to begin, travelled on the rail in mid-division down the backstretch, began to inch closer on the fence by the half, waited behind the front two
around the turn, angled three wide for the stretch run, battled determinedly for the place share but lost the nod at the wire. KNOWING was brushed inside at
the start, stalked four deep outside rivals, ahead of only the poor starter down the backside, closed the gap three wide around the bend and rallied willingly
on the fence down the lane to settle on the fringes. CAPTIVE SILENCE tracked outside in the early going, chased the frontrunning winner through the bend,
failed to switch leads down the stretch and wilted with seventy furlongs from the wire. BACKONTHECHAINGANG broke out on the start, stalked in the third
flight outside horses down the backside, began to edge closer three wide at the three furlong marker, was floated out to the five path for the drive, could not
find more in the stretch and failed to menace. MIDNIGHT MO settled in the two path midfield down the backstretch, was hard ridden on the fence but was
going in the wrong direction throughout the turn and had nothing to offer in the stretch drive. BIG LEW was steadied under a hard right line at the start
leaving the chute, trailed by many down the backside and could never be a factor after the compromised start. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL#7 SUMMER

Footnotes
CHANCEL prompted the pace three wide in the first of two turns, took closer order along the backside to bid for the lead outside with a half mile to run,
battled on the outside with a stubborn foes around the far turn, edged away from that one by upper stretch, braced for the new challenger in mid-stretch and
while encouraged left handed held off rivals to the finish line. CANTUCCI was in the mix between rivals entering the first bend, reined back to have a good
spot all alone watching the engaged duo at the half, moved in to be a menacing presence in the three path straightening for the drive, stalled a bit on the
leader at the furlong marker but fought on late to secure the place share. JUST START ME UP took command on the rail going into the first turn, was
collared outside by a rival at the half mile marker, dueled gamely on the fence throughout the final turn, could not match strides with the winner at the top of
the stretch, fought for the place share in the lane but faded late to settle for the show award. BET N WIN stalked near the rear in the first turn, was ahead of
only one rival when the field spread out along the backside. HELL BENT was unhurried to trail the field in the beginning, could not get interested down the
backstretch, made little headway when rouse in the far turn and failed to reach contention the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
SPINZAR was lightly brushed at the start, moved clear keenly pulling against the rider's restraint to set the early tempo, was kept off the rail dictating terms
and settling down after a while, led them into upper stretch and was asked for more, had enough in reserve and held foes under steady handling while being
guided out a bit nearer an outside challenger in deep stretch. MCAVOY settled off the pace and racing removed from the rail, swung five wide turning into
upper stretch and beginning to advance, reached striking distance but couldn't get to the winner and was brushed lightly late. ROSCAR unhurriedly brought
up the rear inside, came out on the turn and was three wide in upper stretch in behind the leader, was in a bit tight while seeking room late and bumped an
outside foe lightly. EXUDE brushed a rival at the start, settled outside at the rear, swung six wide into upper stretch, kicked on mildly. COLLECTIVE FORCE
made an early move outside three to four wide past the five-eighths to get within range just off the leader, was put to urging three furlongs out, could not
sustain the effort and flattened out. RUNAWAY CHARLIE chased in behind two to three wide into the turn, weakened. AWESOME ENTRY chased from
inside, steadily retreated.

Footnotes
GRANDE SOIREE tracked just outside entering first turn, was content to sit just outside, off the pacesetter down the back straight, moved in to bid for the
lead outside three furlongs out, dueled with the stubborn frontrunner inside around the final turn, opened up straightening out for the drive and was kept to
the task to hold safe for the win. H C HOLIDAY had a tracking role on the rail in the beginning, sat behind the leader down the backstretch, had a nice
position waiting behind the embattle duo on the fence in the far turn, shifted out three wide at the quarter pole but chased the winner in vain to the wire while
besting the rest in the end. LION KINGDOM co-trailed inside down the backstretch, made little headway when nudged on in the final turn, found his best
stride in the two path at the top of the stretch and closed with a solid late kick from the furlong pole to the wire to capture third money. JACK THE CAT
travelled on the fence in mid-pack for the early stages of the race, kept pace with rivals three furlongs from the wire, dueled for the show award in the three
path between horses in upper stretch but settled for a minor role when crossing the finish line. ROBITAILLE was off slow to start, stalked three wide near the
rear outside in the beginning, co-trailed on the outside down the backside , could no find more to make any impact on the final bend and passed weary foes
in the lane. SAILOR'S PASSION sat at the back nestled on the rail, improved position down the backstretch inside, offered a brief rally at the quarter pole,
angled out widest in the six path turning for home but made little presence in the stretch running. STYLISH GENT assumed the lead under a snug hold
entering the first turn, dictated the pace down the backside, was headed outside by the winner at the three furlong pole, fought on while running on the
fence throughout the far turn and folded on the fence in the final eighth. GREAT FACES had a poor start to begin, stalked in the three path between foes
into the first turn, sat in midfield down the backstretch, tracked in the two path, watching the contesting duo around the final bend, could not keep up with the
top trio by the quarter pole and faltered betwene horses at the furlong marker. SPRING MOUNTAIN stalked four wide outside foes in the first turn, was
shuffled back a few positions along the backstretch, made no progress while roused around the far turn and came up empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
PINE KNOLL got away alertly going straight to the front, set the pace inside on or just off the rail facing outside pressure, moved clear and held sway under
steady urging. SPEEDY HANS tracked from inside, came out in upper stretch with aim on the leader, could make no substantial headway but was clearly
second best. PRICELESS WILL was bumped into a foe at the start, settled at the rear near the inside, angled seven wide having gotten to upper stretch, ran
on to improve. BREAKING ALONE broke outwardly bumping a rival, was encouraged along but lacking speed bringing up the rear from off the inside,
improved position in the stretch. TOP OF THE CHARTS stalked from outside going four to five wide thorugh the turn, flattened out in the drive.
COURAGEOUS COPPER got away well, pressed the eventual winner from the outset racing two to three wide, came up empty in the stretch. READY FOR
A FIGHT was bumped at the start, chased from between runners, entered the turn three to four wide, was done at the five-sixteenths and dropped back.

Footnotes
MISS SAUGERTIES was off a step slow to begin, quickly recovered on the rail, shifted outside at the half to bid for the lead entering the turn, opened up at
will with five sixteenths to go, had a commanding lead at the top of the stretch and was urged mildly at the furlong pole just to keep her mind on business to
the finish line for the impressive front running score. TALBOT HEIRLOOM stalked near the rear three deep in the early going, started to commence a rally
when splitting foes at the three eighths marker, continued to gain smartly on the fence at the quarter pole, shifted out with momentum to be three wide for
the drive and determinedly between runners got up for the place share in deep stretch. POCKET PAIR tracked three wide outside down the backstretch, sat
alone watching the front pair battle into the turn, closed the gap for the place share in the turn, battled four wide for second money with two rivals inside but
had to settle for the show award in the end. MOTOWN FUNK broke sharp foe the lead, was headed outside by the stablemate with seven sixteenths from
home, fought up front until midway on the turn, tried to cling onto the place share while chasing the winner in stretch but faded late to settle on the fringes.
SERENADING KITTEN travelled outside rivals four deep down the backstretch in the middle of the pack, stalked in the third flight while three wide on the
turn, shifted just outside in the four path straightening out for home and finished up one paced to the wire. BONITA MUNDO was fractious in the stall prior to
the start, broke slowly on the break to stalk near the back of the pack in the two path between horses, was roused three wide in the turn making little
progress angled out to be four wide turning for home and could not play a role in the stretch running. MEAN TO ME settled in the three path in midfield down
the backside, was asked for more while on the fence but was losing ground to rivals throughout the turn and lacked a rally on the rail the stretch drive.
SONGS OF WAR had a slow start to begin, trailed on the fence along the backside, could not narrow the margin around the turn and was not involved in the
stretch.

Footnotes
STONE AGE (IRE) sped clear, set the pace from off the rail and with daylight behind, was shadowed by foes late on the turn, drifted out a bit turning for
home and put to urging, held a foe at a steady margin under continued urging. LAC MACAZA stalked from outside, raced mostly three to five wide
throughout, edged nearer coming past the three-eighths, was within range at the top of the stretch but could make no headway late. CONGLOMERATE was
taken back and reserved at the rear racing inside, saved ground on the turn, came out a few paths leaving that bend but then altered back inward for room,
fought for show. BRITISH ROYALTY tracked from inside, switched out at the seven-sixteenths racing off the inside, was encouraged along three furlongs
out, came out a bit further at the top of the stretch, needed more late. DANCIN IN DA'NILE settled mid-division, advanced outside four wide on the turn to
get within range late on the turn but evened out in the stretch. TITO'S CALLING settled outside at the rear, raced two wide on the turn moving out at the top
of the stretch, was forced out by a rival near the three-sixteenths then moved out further nearing the sixteenth pole for room but was unable to threaten.

Footnotes
GAROFOLI had an ideal set up when by himself watching the contesting duo down the backstretch, tracked two wide between foes at the three furlong
marker, moved to in bid between horses in the three path at the quarter pole, edged away from the other three by mid-stretch and kept on going late to hold
off runners comfortably at the wire. SOUPER RUSH was scrubbed on, pressing the issue on the fence in the beginning, chased the frontrunner on the turn
while nestled on the fence, vied with three others in the two path for the top spot with a quarter mile to run, faded in upper stretch but stubbornly rebid to get
up for the runners share in the end. SOONER LUNAR was allowed to settle at the back finding his stride, started to reach for more ground around the bend,
was in full flight passing a rival inside with a furlong to go, shifted out four wide in deep stretch and closed fast to get up in the shadow of the wire for third
money. FRAC RIGHT stalked four deep outside foes, moved closer to track the pacesetter three wide at the three eighths marker, loomed boldly in the four
path around horses with two furlongs remaining, could not continue the run and stalled late losing the show award on the line. DADDY SEND MONEY was
hustled for the lead with a rival to his inside, cleared to the rail with seven sixteenths to go, was collared outside by a trio of runners by the quarter pole,
weakened in upper stretch on the fence and gave way when in tight on the fence with a sixteenth to run. SILENT TRIBUTE stalked three wide outside in the
early parts of the race, could not mount a rally through the turn, had nothing to offer at the top of the lane and yielded at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
MISTER HOLDEN was brushed inside to begin, had a good position, alone watching what's going on up front with the lead quartet down the backside, was
roused midturn to begin his rally, quickly closed in to pounce five wide in upper stretch and drew away when urged at the furlong pole for the win. CLIVE
CROSS settled on the outside in midfield in the early stages, began to extend his stride on the fence with five sixteenths from the line, sat just behind the
leaders four wide in upper stretch, shifted out at the furlong pole, finding a seam in the five path and closed smartly late to capture the runners up share in a
tight photo. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA tracked the top three rivals while between horses in the back straight, began to reel in the front pair midway around the
turn, poked his head in front for a brief moment four wide straightening out for the drive, battled with the winner until the eighth pole and faded late to be
caught at the finish line for the place share. YODDHA settled in mid-division inside foes down the backstretch, started his run three wide outside rivals by
midturn, angled in the six path for the stretch run to be in the mix for a share but could not continue the rally and was one paced down the lane. ITS JUST
MONEY was away slowly on the break to trail in the early going, started to rally when under a ride on the fail with five sixteenths from home, was looking for
room behind a wall of runners at the top of the lane, weaved through foes in upper stretch and finished with intent in the final furlong. ONTARIO HOLIDAY
was away slowly to begin, began to pick up runners outside with four furlongs remaining, was fanned seven wide taking closer aim to be in the hunt for a
share in upper stretch but stalled in the drive to the wire with a furlong left to run. TRUE SHOT was brushed outside on the start, settled at the back, ahead
of a couple of runners down the backside, was asked for more but could not advance around the turn and lacked a rally in the stretch drive. LEMON TWIST
took control after the start, set the pace along the backside, was collared outside by the quarter pole while running on the fence, fought back briefly on the
rail at the top of the lane, had no more to offer by the furlong pole and faltered late. SEATTLE SUNRISE had a slow start to stalk near the rear in the early
going, could see the field at the half mile marker, lost touch it seemed around the bend but did come on in the stretch to pass a couple of tired runners in the
lane. GLORIOUS REVENGE was coaxed on the rail to get involved up front down the back straight, chased the leaders on the rail throughout the turn, was
in range three wide turning for home but flattened out by mid-stretch. AURELIAN FLAME prompted four deep on the outside along the backstretch, moved
closer through the turn, seized command in the two path outside at the quarter pole, was then headed on both sides turning for home and retreated two
wide at the furlong marker.
