Footnotes
WANNAWHOLELOTTALUV sprinted away from the gate to set the pace from an unchallenged lead and won going away. CLASSIC EMBRACE lacked the
early speed but saved ground throughout and made the late stretch rally to finish strong. LUCKY GEM broke well to prompt the early pace then chased
winner around the turn but was outfinished late. ATTILA THE SPUN chased the leaders and made a mild gain from three wide on the turn but tired.
CLEVER RACE was void of speed and was outrun.

Footnotes
KENYA STRIKE prompted the pace to the first turn then settled off the pace on the inside to the top of the stretch, took command at the three sixteenths
pole and drew clear. REALITOS rushed up four wide to take the lead before the first turn, was pressured to midway through the final turn but edged away to
the top of the stretch and was collared at the three sixteenths pole but kept on to be second best. PAT HAND GIRL was allowed to settle in the middle of the
pack in the two path through the final turn then made a late stretch rally to be up for the show. SHE TOLD YOU SO was allowed to settle near the back to
the final turn then moved up the rail to slip through entering the stretch and made the late inside bid but was not enuf. MIDNIGHT TRIP raced near the back
around the first turn then moved up down the backstretch and showed a late kick in the stretch to improve position. FOLLOW THE SAINT saved ground
while racing in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then shifted out to three wide at the three furlong marker, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch
but faltered. ANN'S STORM was unhurried down the backstretch launched a four wide bid at the three furlong marker but only passed tiring rivals. MO
CLASSY raced off the pace around the first turn then prompted the pace to midway through the final turn and gave way. OUR AMEN raced in the middle of
the pack from the two path but failed to menace.

NATURAL TOUCH broke outward leaving the gate then rushed up to take a pressured lead to midway through the turn, edged away and drew off in the
stretch to prove best. MISS CHARGE IT sprinted away to press the pace from three wide down the backstretch then from two wide to midway through the
turn and kept on to hold the place while being no match for the winner. LEPRECHAUN CHARM broke well and raced off the pace to the turn then fell back
around the turn but make a late kick in the stretch to miss the place. SUMMEROSA broke outward and bumped RON'S LAVENDER leaving the gate then
was void of speed to the top of the stretch and made a mild late rally to improve her position. CHOCTAW BLESSINGS broke outward leaving the gate then
raced close up on the pace from three or four wide to the turn then chased the top two on the turn, tipped out to four wide in the stretch but lacked a late
response. SHEZA SALTY GAL rubbed the gate as she was leaving then raced near the back, made a mild bid to midway through the turn but faltered.
RON'S LAVENDER was bumped by SUMMEROSA leaving the gate and chased the leaders from near the back, made a mild bid on the turn but was never
a threat.

Footnotes
Z Z'S PRINCE vied for the lead from three wide through the turn then engaged PERFECT STAR at the three sixteenths pole, matched strides from the
outside down the stretch and won the nod. PERFECT STAR pressed the pace from two wide to the final turn then engaged DRIED PEPPER at the three
furlong marker and took the lead at the quarter pole but was headed quickly by Z Z'S PRINCE at the three sixteenths pole and matched strides down the
stretch but was denied. ASSET BASIS stalked the pace from four wide to the final turn then tipped in to three wide in upper stretch and gave a late kick to
save the show. SHAMAYIM saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack through the final turn then moved out to three wide at the three sixteenths
pole for a late run and missed the show. DRIED PEPPER sprinted to the lead on the inside to the three furlong marker then was headed by PERFECT
STAR and fought gamely to the quarter pole and gave way. FABLED RULER was unhurried and never a factor. SNIVELING was allowed to settle and was
not a threat. RUSSIAN TANK was always back. MORE ICE raced off the pace on the inside to past the half mile marker then took a bad step then was
pulled up and transported on the equine ambulance.

Footnotes
COUNTRY BELLE raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground through the turn then angled out to three wide in upper stretch, drove past the
leaders and drew off. RONNIE'S DEAL sprinted to the lead from mid track on the backstretch, tipped in around the turn but was caught at the eighth pole
and dug in to save the place. SHEZAPERFECTDREAM roused up the rail to vie for the lead from the inside down the backstretch kept on and cut the corner
into the stretch to challenge the leader to mid stretch and weakened. ADIAMONDINTHESTORM off pace from two wide to the top of the stretch and lacked
the late response. MY IDEA stalked the pace from three wide to the turn and flattened out. MO DIXIE DIVA acted up as the gates opened and had an
awkward start, spotted the field many lengths and was not a factor. SPECIAL GIRL was always back and never a threat.

Footnotes
SCAT FREE sprinted to the front to set the pace while being unchallenged and won going away. BOY CHARLIE stumbled after leaving the gate then was
hustled along from three wide and moved between horses at the half mile marker and kept on but was no match for the winner. YOU'RE ON MUTE broke
outward leaving the gate the raced wide throughout but was able to rally for the show. BLESSED VISION chased the leader from the inside to the quarter
pole and weakened. HELLO MR COPELAND trailed the field and passed tiring rivals. BABY OF THE FAMILY was off slow then rushed to contention to the
turn and gave way. CLASSY SHIPMAN was forwardly placed to the turn and tired.
