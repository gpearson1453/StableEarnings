ARIJANA'S PEARL staked two wide, chased GATE SONG on the far turn, rallied outside of that rival in the stretch run, put a head in front near the sixteenth
marker and drew clear under urging. GATE SONG set the pace racing with a clear lead a bit off the inside, responded when roused at the quarter pole, dug
in gamely in the stretch drive and then was no match for the winner. RAPID MISS TAPIT tracked inside, chased on the turn and tired.

HEY BROTHER stalked two wide, bid on the turn, rallied outside of IRISH HERO in the stretch run and wore down that rival late to prevail. IRISH HERO
away alertly, set the pace racing with a clear lead, responded when roused, dug in gamely inside of the winner and yielded grudgingly. BOLD D'ORO raced
off the pace, came wide into the stretch and rallied mildly. AUTUMNS STRONG MAN tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, lacked a rally and tired.

Footnotes
GRAN RUNNER tracked the pace from the three path, took his que leaving the quarter pole, worked into contention nearing the furlong marker, and kicked
clear under a drive through the lane. MISCHIEVOUS JUAN was shuffled back soon after the start, raced off the pace and off the rail into the turn, six wide in
upper stretch, rallied convincingly through the final furlong. JOHN'S PROMISE vied along the inside, under a ride and under pressure around the turn,
stayed on the through the stretch run. MIDNIGHT GETAWAY broke sharp, vied between runners around the turn, lost ground between leaving the quarter
pole, finished off evenly through the wire. IF WE GET LUCKY broke a step slow, tracked three wide into the turn, pressed outside for pace around the turn,
took the lead into upper stretch, and gave way between runners to the wire. SENATE CHAMBER very slow away from the gate, never a threat.
