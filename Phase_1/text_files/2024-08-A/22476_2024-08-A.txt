BLUSHING BONNIE moved up along the inside soon after the start and engaged ADETERMINEDMOM for the lead, vied around the turn, shook clear at the
head of the lane, remained clear a furlong out then held late under a driving finish. JUST BARB raced off the top pair into the turn, hustled along three wide
into upper stretch and edged closer on the winner in closing strides. ADETERMINEDMOM broke on top and quickly took on the challenge of BLUSHING
BONNIE, vied around the turn, could not match strides with eventual winner at the head of the lane but ran on with interest. SIMPLIFIED dwelt at the start
and trailed in opening stages, hustled along and responded gamely moving into contention late on the turn, came four paths wide into the lane and

turn, angled out nearing mid-turn, which caused OCEAN OF STORMS to check, cleared the lead at the quarter pole, drew off under a drive in upper stretch
then wrapped up late. UXMAL rated off the clear top pair through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, sustained bid through the
lane and finished clearly second best. OCEAN OF STORMS raced off the clear top pair through early stages, edged closer on the top pair late on the
backstretch, was forced to check when MR. THUNDERSTRUCK angled out nearing the mid-way point on the far turn, came three wide into the upper
stretch and ran along for a share. BEEALEA raced off the early pace, hustled along four wide around the far turn and failed to threaten in the lane.
TEMPTED MISSION vied for the lead around the first turn, continued to battle while racing clear over the next pursuer up the backstretch, got headed for
the lead mid-way around the far turn and faded through the lane. KOBE'S CAUSE vied for the lead and opened up on rivals around the first turn, continued
to duel up the backstretch then came up empty mid-way around the far turn and dropped back. STEWARDS HUNG INQUIRY LOOKING INTO THE

Footnotes
KOSELIO was forwardly placed, cleared the lead at the quarter pole and drew off in the final furlong. GRAND DESIGN set the pace, was no match for the
winner nearing the quarter pole, ran on and cleared second best. DILLON ROCKS tracked the early pace, urged four wide late on the turn, weakened off the
top pair in the lane and held show. ONCE UPON A DREAM raced near midpack, hustled along three wide around the far turn and just missed show.
MEGATAP rated off the early pace, gained closer contention four wide near the quarter pole then weakened in the lane. ONE TIME GEM raced off the early
pace, urged inside into upper stretch, gained position then gave way. CHARMING CHARLIE stalked up the backstretch then flattened around the far turn.
MR CREED failed to move into contention. GALACTIC EMPIRE raced off the pace and had no response when called upon.
