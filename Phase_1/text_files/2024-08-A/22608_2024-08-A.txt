Footnotes
TOLEDO ROCKET set pace, held off challenge, drew away. ASTA LAVISTA HONEY chased leader, bid backstretch, held place. INNOCENT MAN taken
back, rallied for show. STAY OUTA MY WAY mid field, best of rest. HOT ROD JIMMY chased pace, steady fade. MIRRORED mid field, showed little.
FORGOTTEN VOWS unhurried early, no rally.
