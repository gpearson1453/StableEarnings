A REAL HERO bumped at the start, raced close to the pace in an outside trip, closed steadily and was gaining fast late. SUPORB broke slowly and bumped
at the start, dropped inside to save ground, angled out for the drive and finished well to get up late for show. TAP N TWINE raced close to the pace along
the inside, bid along the rail on the turn, hung late and was caught for third. COOKIN ROSES broke in, set a pressured pace to the turn, fell back and
leveled off. PALACE MAGIC was never far back, raced between horses, lacked a stretch response and dropped back.

LIKE A SALTSHAKER settled off the pace, angled in on the turn, bid off the rail, assumed command, drew off and was kept to task. RICHIESONAROLL
bumped at the start, was never far off the pace, angled out mid stretch and closed well to earn place while no threat to the winner. I'M WIDE AWAKE was
hustled along to duel for the lead, was getting out on the turn, taken in hand, fell back and held for show. SWIFT AS I AM lost his footing at the start while
getting away well, raced in the back, closed steadily and was outfinished for third. COMISKEY PARK bumped at the start, was void of early speed, went
widest in the drive and finished well. TWIRLING ROSES was away alertly, flashed speed, dropped back, saved ground and lacked a bid. CONGRATS ON
FIFTY vied two across, was carried out on the turn, fell back, weakened in the drive and faded.

Footnotes
PALHACO vied around the first turn, inched clear entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace and held on gamely. MISTER CHARMING moved up
inside entering the backstretch, got boxed in to the second turn, fell back, angled out, angled back in in the upper stretch, closed willingly inside and couldn't
get by the winner. TWO COOKIE RULE close to pace, awaited room on the second turn, fell back, came again, went willingly to the wire, didn't have
enough late and earned show. JIM AND JIM lagged early, raced outside, rallied around the turn, went widest in the drive and finished well. MR FROST vied
inside around the first turn, was taken back and angled out into the backstretch, pressed the pace to the upper stretch, bid and came up empty. FLASHY
RICHIE was unhurried early, saved ground and lacked a bid. WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR threw his head at the start, trailed the field and was not urged
through the stretch.

ABSOLUTE MIRACLE raced in close, challenged three across on the turn, dueled to upper stretch, drew clear and held safely while under steady urging.
FROM SCRATCH pressed the pace along the inside, was taken back on the turn, angled out, bid four wide, couldn't gain despite strong handling and held
for place. MISCHIEF LILY dropped inside to save ground, angled out on the turn, bid six wide and closed well to earn show. GEORGIA ON E'SMIND
pressed the pace, challenged between horses on the turn, weakened in the drive and faded from contention. TIZMEONEMORETIME was void of early
speed, offered a mild bid inside and improved position. WAHIDA OF MARDAN lagged while racing outside, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid.
DRAMA QUEENIE set the pace to the turn and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
UNIFIED WEEKEND vied inside, inched clear into the second turn and drew off in the drive while kept to task. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS raced close to the
pace along the inside, angled out on the backstretch, rallied into the second turn to loom a threat, weakened in the drive and held for place while no match
for the winner. NOT VERY GENTLE advanced to the second turn, swung wide entering the stretch, bid, had little left and was clearly best of the rest.
BLURT was never far back, rallied around the second turn, bid six wide, had nothing left and gave way. ZARMAE was outrun in an even effort. FLYING
SAMURAI vied two across, tired into the far turn and stopped. KRAMDEN trailed the field. Pick 8:2/4/5-2/4/7-1/2/3/4-1/6/7-6/7/8/9-2/7-1/2/6/7-1/4.

Footnotes
GIANNO was never far off the pace, raced towards the outside, rallied around the turn, assumed command and drew off in the drive under mild urging. ALL
ABOUT TONITE vied four wide around the first turn, drew clear entering the backstretch, set the pace with a clear lead to the second turn, fought back when
headed, was no match late and held for place. SKYLANE raced mid pack, advanced around the far turn and offered a mild bid to earn show. RICKY'S BEST
vied around the first turn, settled off the pace while racing inside, tired entering the second turn and faded from contention. I O FEDRO was unprepared at
the start to be last away, was void of early speed, bid inside entering the stretch and had nothing left. BLACK RUSSIAN trailed the field, raced outside and
passed tiring rivals. DAKOTA INVADER showed speed to the second turn, tired and gave way. RAYFIELD was eased and walked off.
