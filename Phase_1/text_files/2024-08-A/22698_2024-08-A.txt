Footnotes
THRILLA hustled away from the gate to take command, set a well rated, well measured pace, responded when called upon turning for home to draw away
quickly and was kept to task through the lane in a dominant performance. FLY COMMANDER prompted the pace through the turn, was no match for the
winner and chased him down the lane while holding the place. ACE ON THE TURN tracked the pace to the turn, rallied along the fence on the bend and
failed to sustain the bid while grinding through the stretch. TIME FOR RESTRAINT stalked the leaders from four wide to the turn and lacked a rally flattening
out on the turn. FLOATING SMOKEY trailed throughout and was outrun.

Footnotes
CONTINUITY stalked the pace from four wide to midway on the bend, rallied approaching the quarter pole to take command in upper stretch and drew away
as much best. DANCING MAGIC pressed the pace through the turn, rallied at the quarter pole to briefly take the lead at the top of the lane, was no match
for the winner but kept on willingly as second best. LA MARINERA tracked the leaders from the rail, was set to a drive on the turn and ground along to be up
for the show. KIP THE DISTANCE passed tiring rivals with mild late interest. SEVILLA chased the leaders from four wide and lacked a closing bid. LIBITINA
set a pressured pace for a half mile and weakened through the lane. LIZ DREAMIN was outrun.

Footnotes
BINNIE stalked the pace through the turn, rallied three wide turning for home, engaged the pacesetter inside the eighth pole and prevailed in the final strides
in a determined drive. NINETEENAMENDMENT dueled on the lead from the rail to the quarter pole, shook clear in upper stretch, responded when
challenged by the winner in the final sixteenth and just missed in a game effort. CAROLINA HIDEAWAY unhurried in the early going to trail, rallied circling
wide turning for home, altered course in mid-stretch angling to the inside and finished well to be up for the show. WISE AND ELEGANT tracked the pace
from the inside saving ground through the turn, angled out to rally in the lane and evened out in deep stretch. CLOUDS OF WHITE was one-paced travelling
evenly. WOODS HOLE failed to menace. HIDDEN VASE pressed the pace dueling on the lead from two wide to the quarter pole and gave way in the lane.

GHOSTLY GAL stalked the pace from the rail while well held to the far turn, rallied while angling out turning for home and closed well to be going away late
in the lane. KATIES A LADY set the pace on a clear lead, was well rated on the lead saving a response for the stretch run, held a clear advantage to
mid-stretch and was out-finished in the final sixteenth while holding on gamely for the place. MISS DELICIOUS unhurried for the first five-eighths, rallied on
the far turn circling nine wide turning for home and closed well belatedly to be gaining with every stride late in the drive. AMAZON QUEEN reserved off the
pace near the rear of the field, made a steady advance on the final bend and rallied from seven wide closing well in the stretch. STELLA MARS rated in
mid-pack from four wide down the backside and mounted a mild bid through the lane. OUR STRONG VOWS tracked the leaders to midway on the far turn,
rallied five wide to loom up turning for home and finished evenly unable to sustain the bid. WOOHOO JACKIE BLUE tracked the leaders down the backside,
mounted a bid on the turn to threaten and flattened out turning for home. SARATOGA GAZE was well placed just off the pacesetter from two wide to the
quarter pole and gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
ASPEN DAWN reserved off the pace racing three wide through the first turn, remained near the rear of the field down the backside, circled seven wide on
the far turn and closed well to prevail in a determined drive. TALES TO TELL stalked the pace from the inside to the far turn, rallied waiting behind the front
flight searching for racing room, angled in to the rail in upper stretch for clear racing room and finished well along the rail. AKAYLA (IRE) broke slow giving
the field several lengths, raced four wide through the first when closing to the back of the pack, continued to trail to the far turn, circled nine wide at the top
of the lane and raliied with a late surge to share the place. H M LEGACY raced between rivals in the third flight to the far turn, worked through traffic splitting
rivals and showed good late energy. STRATOSPHERIC rated off the pace in the third flight along the fence, continued to save ground cutting the corner
turning for home and finished willingly. FOREVER AGAIN set a pressured pace from the rail throughout, fought on in the lane drifting out to the three path
and weakened in deep stretch. MAURYA circled five wide in the first turn with an early move to the leaders, prompted the pace from four wide down the
backstretch, rallied to take a brief lead in upper stretch and was outkicked late in the drive. ACQUALINA was well placed early with the leaders in the first
turn, settled to a tracking trip from between rivals down the backside, lacked raing room in upper stretch while jostled between rivals, angled to the outside
late but finished evenly having endured a tough trip. AMENDMENT tracked the leaders in mid-pack from between rivals, made a mild bid turning for home to
be prominent in upper stretch and lacked a closing kick. LOYAL ROYAL raced four wide through the first turn to stalk the pace in the second flight, was in
contention on the far turn and weakened in the lane. BEAUTIFUL MISCHIEF pressed the pace from between rivals to the top of the stretch and gave way in
the lane. I BE GONE never threatened fading on the far turn.

Footnotes
AS CATCH CAN stalked the pace through the far turn, angled out when rallying turning for home, cleared inside the eighth pole and held sway to the wire.
PURE MAJESTIC dueled on the pace from the fence to the far turn, dropped back losing position turning for home and came on again in the lane gamely to
claim the place. QUEEN IN THE DECK tracked the pace from the rail through the far turn and rallied mildly unable to gain in the stretch run. TACO CAT
BACKWARDS pressed the pace from two wide for a half, took the lead with an early bid nearing the three-eighths pole, opened a clear advantage on the
final turn and weakened coming home. JUDY'S FLYER rank in the early going down the lane the first time, raced mid-pack on the backstretch, made a brief
bid on the far turn and flattened out. RUSH WEEK shuffled back approaching the first turn and went evenly without impact. MISS TAPATIA was not a factor.
BAJA DE ORO chased the leaders from three wide down the backside and lacked a response when called upon on the final turn.

Footnotes
JURASSIC CHICK tracked the pace from the fence through the turn, angled four wide rallying turning for home, altered course to the inside through the lane
and prevailed in a determined drive. CLASSY LIL BETTY stalked the pace from three wide on the turn, lost position turning for home and rallied late on the
far outside surging to gain the place. MONSTER SUMMER reserved off the pace saving ground along the fence, angled out in upper stretch, dove back to
the inside late and was gaining late having to overcome traffic in the lane. DAWN'S CREED tracked the leaders from the outside, rallied wide in the lane
looming in mid-stretch and was out-finished in a good effort. QUEEN VALENTINA pressed the pace through the turn in a duel, took the lead in mid-stretch
while drifting out and weakened late in the lane. CHEYENNE SPRING saved ground racing along the fence to no avail. COUNTRY ECONOMICS dueled on
the lead to the head of the stretch and gave way down the lane. STORM CREED walked away from the gate fiving the field a sizable head-start and chased
the field the entire trip having lost all chance. STYLE AND PROFILE dropped to the back of the field in the first hundred yards, was the distant trailer to the
top of the stretch and showed some late energy in the lane.

Footnotes
ZAINO broke a step tardy to trail early, moved up to race mid-pack while unhurried along the rail down the backside, saved ground on the final bend and
rallied up the inside down the stretch in a determined drive. STAYINYOURLANE hustled early to hold the rail position, stalked from the fence while well held
down the backstretch, was set to an early drive on the turn lacking a response, angled to the clear at the head of the lane and rallied belatedly to be gaining
in deep stretch. TRUE ACCOUNT prompted the pace from three wide for three-quarters, bid in upper stretch to be with the lead in mid-stretch and was
out-finished in the drive. AMERICAN DAY unhurried early to be at the back of the main body of the field and showed late interest with a rally along the rail in
the lane. COUSIN GIORGOS rushed up from the outside to take the lead into the first turn, set a pressured pace for three-quarters and weakened coming
home. GREYGRAZIE tracked the leaders from mid-pack and lacked a closing response fading in the lane. READY AND ABLE was outrun.
