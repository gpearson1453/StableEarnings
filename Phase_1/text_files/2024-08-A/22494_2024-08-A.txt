Footnotes
BATTLE OF DOVER settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, took over between foes turning for home and
held firm under a drive. IMMENSE FAITH raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, advanced five wide around the far turn and finished willingly for
the place. LOMACHENKO trailed in the two path early, edged closer three wide around the far turn, angled to the rail in midstretch and rallied for the show.
TIZ THE COAST raced in range two wide for a half, chased four wide around the far turn and was one-paced in the lane. FRANKS MIMI saved ground off
the pace, swung five wide in midstretch and improved position outside. MIDNIGHT ONYX prompted the pace two and three wide and weakened in the lane.
MUNTALIQ saved ground and failed to menace. LAST U TURN set the pace along the rail and tired in the stretch. LORD OF THE NILE chased the early
pace two wide and retreated inside around the far turn.

Footnotes
VINCEY GIRL raced off the pace in the four path, was roused from the three path early around the turn, swung out to the eight path turning into the lane,
rallied, and drew clear of inner foes in the final sixteenth. DOT tracked inside, received a right handed cue in the two path passing the three-eighths pole,
tipped out to the five path to bid at the top of the stretch, stuck her head in front while drifting out entering the final furlong, and was quickly overtaken by an
outer foe before the sixteenth to settle with place. CRIMSON chased in the five path, was coaxed along in the four path around the turn, floated out to the
eight path turning into the lane, and was one paced for show. ATHENA'S WISDOM prompted the pace in the four path, bid under coaxing from the three
path midway around the turn, stuck her head in front passing the quarter, but flattened in the final furlong. GIRVIN GIRL set the pace in the two path, was
cued along the rail midway around the turn, but faded. SLENDER SLIPPER trailed throughout.

Footnotes
URGE TO MERGE (IRE) was bumped on both sides at the start, raced off the early pace two wide, advanced three wide around the turn, seized command
leaving the eighth pole and held safe over late challengers. PRAISEWORTHY hit the starting gate to get away last, trailed down the backstretch, raced five
and six wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and finished strongly. INSOLENT was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide,
angled out turning for home, rallied through the lane but was outkicked between foes late. COVE STAR broke a bit awkwardly, sped to the front, set the
pace along the rail and weakened through the final furlong. FOURTY FOUR chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. MAX FORWARD SPEED
was reluctant to load, raced off the pace four and five wide and never threatened. MR. RHODIUM was unprepared for the start, pressed the pace two wide
and tired through the lane. IN THE BLUE had speed inside and faltered in the stretch. ICONIC ROCK was bumped just after the start, raced three wide and
made little impact.

HEIR TO THE ROAR bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the six path, ranged up in the four path midway around the turn, swung from the five
path into the lane, took the lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear in the closing stages. SHEZA RAJUN CAJUN bumped with an outer foe at the start,
set the pace in the three path, was roused from the two path midway around the turn, dug in from the three path entering the stretch, but yielded in the final
sixteenth to place. IDEAL BREEZE stalked in the five path, loomed between foes while under a nudge in the three path midway around the turn, swung from
the four path into the lane, angled out passing the eighth pole, and kept on for show. MACASSA bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid up close in the
two path, waited along the rail midway around the turn, was roused passing the quarter, but was one paced. NIKEE KAN prompted the pace in the four path
but faded. BARBARA had a slow start, trailed in the four path and never threatened from the seven path in the stretch. DOVE IN CHARGE bumped at the
start with an outer foe, rated in the two path but was no menace.

FOURWAY STOP set the pace along the rail and held firm under a drive. ROTONDO stalked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide near the quarter pole,
had aim outside of the winner but was denied. PURE MAGIC GIRL raced in range two wide, steadied near the three-quarters pole, chased three wide
around the far turn and was along for the show in the final strides. GOSSIPER was in a bit tight at the start, raced off the pace three wide, advanced three
wide around the far turn but flattened out in the lane and just missed third. SAUCY SIX trailed inside, went four wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly.
FOLLOW THE FED chased the winner two wide and faded in the stretch. ON THE NILE was outrun inside. KILKENNY BELLA played no factor while racing
two and three wide.

LOOK LIKE IT bobbled at the start, stalked in the six path, ranged up under a nudge to bid midway around the turn, took the lead passing the quarter pole,
tipped into the four path at the top of the lane, and inched clear. GALLOP D'HERMES prompted the pace in the five path, bid under a ride between foes
midway around the turn, and kept on while on her left lead from the two path down the stretch for place. SONADORA GIRL trailed in the five path, was
coaxed along in the four path around the turn, and finished evenly on her left lead from the six path down the lane for show. GULLFAXI chased in the two
path, floated out to the center in upper stretch, and made no impact. MISPRINT set the pace in the four path but yielded passing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
CARAMBASO broke outwardly, set the pace in the two path and widened under a drive in the lane. LOU broke a step slow and was in tight at the start,
advanced along the rail around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and kept on to be clearly second best. TO THE
MAX chased the pace four wide, lacked the needed rally but stayed on for the show. EXCUSES prompted the winner three wide and weakened in the drive.
NOBLE N MAGICAL pressed the pace two wide and tired after a half. RUIZ JUNIOR failed to menace while racing four wide. GONNA PICK DOMENIC was
outrun while racing three wide. MONEYLOVE had early speed inside, steadied near the five-eighths marker and had no further bids while saving ground.
FASTIDIOUS hesitated at the start and made little impact while racing two wide.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC VENEZUELA laid in range in the two path, waited along the inside early around the far turn, angled out under coaxing passing the quarter, took
aim in the five path at the top of the lane, and kicked past an inner pair around the sixteenth. CANDY GRAY laid up close in the three path, bid two wide
passing the quarter, swung from the three path into the stretch, and ran on for place. MOJAVE DESERT showed the way in the two path, was nudged along
the rail around the far turn, tipped out to the two path at the top of the lane, and dug in, but was edged out by an outer pair to show. SHOW OFF had an
awkward start, laid off the pace in the four path, was roused between foes from the two path into the far turn, swung from the four path into the stretch, and
mildly gained. LADY CHA CHA chased in the four path, had to steady passing the half, was roused in the three path midway around the far turn, fanned out
to the seven path turning into the lane, and stayed on but made no impact. CATHOLIKA rated in the three path, was roused along the rail into the far turn,
but was one paced from the two path in the stretch. MI AMORE tracked in the four path but faded from the five path in the stretch. CHI CHI broke well but
was taken back to trail along the inside early and never menaced. CARRINGTON laid in midpack from the five path but weakened.

roused into the turn, swung from the five path into the lane, but was one paced for show. CANDY STREET raced off the pace in the five path, was coaxed
around the far turn, but made no impact from the six path in the stretch. MAYHEMINTHEPALACE trailed in the two path, steadied going into the turn, and

four path but failed to bid. IMAPEPPA bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the two path but weakened. GALIPAN dropped back in the three path

Footnotes
GRAND MO THE FIRST bumped at the start, settled off the pace inside, advanced at the rail around the far turn, split rivals three wide turning for home,
took over in midstretch and dug in to repel a late challenge. BRAWN bumped at the start, raced off the duel two wide, advanced two wide around the far
turn, angled four wide turning for home as the winner split foes inside of him, switched leads multiple times in the stretch and was gaining late. PREVENT
engaged in a protracted duel at the rail to the midstretch and held well for the show. QUESTER bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide and
lacked the needed rally. SALVATTORE PRINCE was pinched back at the start, causing the rider to briefly lose the right iron, saved ground off the pace and
was no threat. BAYTOWN PARFAIT bumped at the start, dueled two wide to upper stretch and wilted.
