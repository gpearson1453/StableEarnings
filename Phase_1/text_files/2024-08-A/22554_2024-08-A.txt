LILTONYTWOPHONES was reluctant to load, then stalked the pace three wide, then moved up to press the pace two to three wide on the turn, made a bid
off the turn and dueled for command by the furlong marker and then edged clear late to prove best under a drive. ROCKET DRAGON set the early pace on
the inside, then was pressured on the turn while on the inside came two wide off the turn and dueled for command and had a long drive with the winner but
was out-gamed late. CHARLIE SHOWTIME tracked the early pace on the inside, eased off the inside on the turn, three wide by the quarter pole and came
four wide off the turn, then lacked the needed winning bid while staying on for the show award. GAME SEVEN chased the early pace and made a mild three
wide bid mid way on the turn, then could not sustain that bid and came five wide off the bend and had no late kick. DIAMOND HEIST was bumped at the
break, settled on the inside on the turn and had no rally. EDDIE W was reserved early, saved ground on the turn and was not a threat.

SASSY LAD vied for the lead on the outside of rivals, made a three to four wide bid leaving the turn and took over, then drew clear in the drive to prove best,
driving. TERMSOFENGAGEMENT rushed up the inside to vie for the lead on the inside, then ran on well to the wire but could not match strides with the
winner while being clearly second best. LIVING WATER vied for the lead in between rivals and faded in the final furlong, bested rest. JOVA was outrun
early, saved ground on the turn and was roused to be motivated and then cut the corner and moved out leaving the furlong marker and had a belated rally.
UPSTATE AND BACK was settled early, three wide on the turn and lacked the needed rally. DREAM KNIGHT chased the pace two to three wide on the
turn behind the trio vying for command moved out and came four wide off the bend but weakened.

SAVE THE MISCHIEF broke alertly to set the pace while in hand in the two path early, then raced on the inside to the two path on the turn, then was sent
down leaving the three sixteenths and given one pop right handed with the crop nearing the furlong marker and responded well to draw off in the furlong
grounds to prove much the best under mild urging. TIME OF OUR LIVES tracked the pace and saved ground on the turn, made a mild bid leaving the turn
on the inside but proved to be no match for the winner while being second best. CITY OF LONDON stalked the winner three wide and weakened in the
drive, held show award. ROYAL UPSTART was off slow and about two to three lengths last, then moved up the inside, moved out and was four wide on the
turn to be in contention by the quarter pole but flattened out in the drive, clearly bested rest. SISTER EVE was settled early, came five wide into the lane and
was empty. TRACE MARTINIS was outrun early and failed to menace. BID FOR THE CROWN chased the pace three to two wide and stopped on the turn.
