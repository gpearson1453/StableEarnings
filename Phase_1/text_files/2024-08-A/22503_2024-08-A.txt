Footnotes
ALL HALLOWS sent leaving the start, assumed command and set the pace off of the rail into the first turn, well handled while carving out moderate fractions
nearing the half-mile, shook free into the far turn, drew clear into the stretch, felt a bit of pressure from the oncoming runner-up and kept to task in the final
sixteenth. TROJAN WAY broke alertly, ceded the early lead to ALL HALLOWS and stalked outside of that rival into the first turn, prompted the moderate
pace along the backstretch run, chased outside of ALL HALLOWS into the far turn, outkicked into the stretch, re-rallied into the final sixteenth, Rivera lost
his crop in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner and bested the rest. HAPPY IS forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace from
between rivals into the backstretch run, chased two wide into the second turn, ran in pursuit while saving ground into the stretch, could not match strides
with the top pair into the final sixteenth and held clearly for third. CLICKING tracked the early pace from the outside, raced three to four wide into the
backstretch run, well placed nearing the half-mile, outrun into the second turn and gave way. WELL SPOKEN LADY settled off of the early pace while not
far back, saved ground into the backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace from the inside heading to the half-mile marker, lost ground into the second turn
and tired in the stretch drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
DEFENSOR FORTIS broke alertly, settled just off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, well placed into the backstretch run, maintained a
ground saving trip heading to the half-mile marker, waited for racing room into the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch, split rivals at the furlong marker and
rallied past mid-stretch, confronted ACERO into the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch and determinedly got up in the final strides. ACERO allowed to
settle, saved ground into the first turn, unhurried while not far back nearing the half-mile, gained ground three wide into the far turn, got caught a bit in tight
approaching the quarter pole, angled widest for the drive, rallied and took command past mid-stretch, all out into the final sixteenth, met the bid of
DEFENSOR FORTIS in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while holding safely for second. UNCLE WALT squeezed leaving the start, settled outside
of rivals into the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run, well placed approaching the second turn, mounted a four wide bid at the quarter
pole, vied for the lead into upper stretch and gained command at the furlong marker, overtaken by the leading pair into the final sixteenth and clear for third.
DO IT FOR DAVE crowded at the start, was a bit slow away from the gate and unhurried in the early stages, trailed to the half-mile marker, roused two wide
into the far turn, shifted three wide into upper stretch and rallied at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and flattened out in
the late stages. RUNNIN UTE crowded at the start and off a bit slowly, was a bit rank to begin but settled off of the early pace and tracked four then three
wide into the first turn, well placed into the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid into the far turn, vied between rivals into upper stretch, lost position at
the furlong marker and gave way in the final sixteenth. DANGEROUS GAME sent to establish the early lead, assumed command into the first turn and set a
decent pace into the backstretch run, carved out the fractions to the half-mile, showed the way into the far turn and came under pressure at the quarter
marker, lost the lead into upper stretch and faded in the drive. HOT JOURNEY stalked the early pace four wide into the first turn, well placed into the
backstretch run, attended to the decent pace heading to the half-mile, mounted a two wide bid between runners into the far turn, could not keep pace into
upper stretch and tired in the final furlong. CORAZON DE LUCIA prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace three wide and between runners into
the first turn, lost position along the backstretch run and chased the decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, could not keep pace into the far turn and
lacked a response in the stretch.

WARREN'S WILD RIDE was pushed on to get forward position from the break then engaged in a duel inside of HAPPY CHAPPY for the early lead, was
traveling well when set down at the quarter pole, put a length on that rival turning for home, held sway as that foe continued to chase down the stretch,
pulled clear in the final furlong and prevailed in a solid effort. OUTER SUNSET broke slowly then was allowed to settle behind the field, made steady
forward progress down the backstretch to regain contact with the field before the turn, stayed in the clear to the outside through the turn three to four paths
from the rail, responded to steady handling and intermittent urging with a strong rally down the stretch was gaining on the winner in the final yards but ran
out of time. HAPPY CHAPPY broke well and dueled outside of WARREN'S WILD RIDE to the quarter pole, came under some pressure at the quarter pole
and lost the lead, battled back gamely down the stretch but was unable to reel in the winner and was passed late for the place. KEEPYOURPRANCEON
settled into a tracking position while holding the inside position down the backstretch, was set down when with three furlongs to go then swung three wide to
set up a late run, took a light bump from OUTER SUNSET at three eighths pole and flattened out. CEE'S THE IMAGE was hustled out of the gate and was
up with the leaders in the initial stages but backed off the developing pace duel, tracked that pair two to three wide to the turn, came under pressure before
the three furlong pole, dropped back and was outrun from that point while being kept to task.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI MIST forwardly placed in the early running, tracked the pace two wide into the first turn, well placed into the backstretch run and tracked the
decent pace approaching the half-mile marker, chased three wide into the far turn, roused at the quarter marker, loomed into upper stretch and raced on
even terms with TURA LURA heading to the furlong pole, responded to urging past mid-stretch, bested the stubborn runner-up in the final sixteenth and
determinedly held in a drive at the finish. TURA LURA broke in at the start, recovered and sent to establish the early lead, assumed command into the first
turn and set a decent pace into the backstretch run, set a pressured pace heading to the half-mile marker, dueled inside of TOPANTICIPATION into the far
turn, shook free into the stretch then met the bid of SHANGHAI MIST nearing the furlong grounds, battled the determined winner into the final sixteenth,
grudgingly gave way in deep stretch and held for second at the finish. TIZ MY PRINCESS squeezed at the start and away a bit slowly, unhurried leaving the
start, saved ground into the first turn, content to trail approaching the half-mile marker, guided three to four wide approaching the quarter marker, mounted a
five wide bid into the stretch, finished well into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch and held for third. A CROWN FOR KITTEN
took back off of the early pace, raced two to three wide into the first turn, unhurried through the backstretch run, guided two to three wide into the far turn,
got caught in tight while behind runners and checked approaching the quarter marker, split rivals into upper stretch and rallied at the furlong pole, gaining in
deep stretch but not enough. A BROKEN BREEZE got caught a bit in tight in the opening stages and steadied between rivals passing the wire for the first
time, settled outside of runners into the first turn and raced two to three wide into the backstretch run, improved position three wide and between runners
nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, needed more into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. NORTHERN ROSE allowed to settle, saved
ground into the first turn, unhurried through the backstretch run, improved position two wide and between runners into the second turn, got caught a bit in
tight into upper stretch and finished evenly in the late stages. ANISETTE settled in the second flight to begin, went outside of rivals into the first turn, chased
three wide into the backstretch run, well placed nearing the half-mile pole, mounted a four wide bid into the far turn, swung to the six path into upper stretch,
could not muster the needed late response and weakened in the final furlong. TOPANTICIPATION (GB) asked for early speed, raced close up to the pace
entering the first turn and stalked outside of TURA LURA into the backstretch run, advanced to prompt the decent pace heading to the half-mile marker,
pressed the pace between rivals into the far turn, outkicked into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and faded. ZELAIA settled just off of
the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, tracked the decent pace while saving ground heading to the half-mile pole, saved all of the ground into
the far turn, lost position at the quarter marker and tired in the drive. TURIAF away in good order, lost action approaching the first turn, pulled up at the
seven furlong marker and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
SHADOWED THOUGHTS broke well then tracked the dueling leaders while staying to the outside, was traveling very well heading into the turn and was
contending for the lead four wide just past the three furlong pole, took the lead passing the quarter pole under a mild hand ride, then pulled clear under
strong handling and intermittent urging. ZIPPIDY DU DAD settled near the rear of the field after the break, stayed out in the five path for the backstretch run
then had some forward momentum going into the turn, stayed to the outside, came into the stretch in the five path and produced a nice run but could not
reel in the winner while well clear of the third horse. SUSIE CRU was last away and had to be ridden to keep close to the pack, was in a full drive with three
furlongs to run, tipped out to the five or six path at the head of the stretch and passed the tiring pacesetters to gain the third spot. GIRL ON HOLIDAY was
hustled from the break and battled inside of three horses contending for the early lead, held on well to mid-stretch then finished evenly while holding position
to the wire. EMERALD FLASH broke well and dueled with GIRL ON HOLIDAY through the first quarter mile then was between horses when MAGGIE'S
FAYE joined the fray near the seven-sixteenths pole, tired from earlier efforts by mid-stretch but was still trying to the finish. MAGGIE'S FAYE tracked the
dueling leaders down the backstretch then moved to join them heading into the turn, had SHADOWED THOUGHTS to the outside and was third from the
rail as four horses fanned out across the track at the quarter pole, weakened in upper stretch and had nothing to offer in the late stages. DARLIN
CLEMENTINE was outrun early then ridden to keep contact with the field, advanced some heading into the turn then dropped out of contention near the
three furlong marker and was no factor from that point. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

Footnotes
TURNERLOOSE rated nicely off of the early pace, tracked from the second flight entering the clubhouse turn, well placed through the backstretch run,
chased two to three wide into the far turn, given her cue into upper stretch, made a quick move to assume command and kicked clear at the furlong marker,
drifted out past mid-stretch, kept to task approaching the sixteenth-pole and drew away under hand urging in the late stages. DELUSIVELY allowed to
settle, raced two wide into the first turn then shifted to the inside entering the backstretch run, unhurried heading to the half-mile marker, saved ground into
the far turn, angled three wide for the drive and rallied at mid-stretch, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth and outfinished LAKOTA
SPIRIT for the place honors. LAKOTA SPIRIT unhurried away from the start, saved ground into the first turn, shifted to the two path into the backstretch run,
gained ground into the far turn, roused four wide into the stretch and rallied at the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner into the final
sixteenth, outfinished for second and clear in the end for third. GRACE PERIOD (FR) prominent away from the start, engaged with LEISUREWEAR in the
early stages and prompted that rival through moderate fractions into the backstretch run, kept close attendance while outside of LEISUREWEAR heading to
the half-mile marker, pressed the pace into the far turn, could not match strides with oncoming rivals into the stretch and faded in the late stages.
LEISUREWEAR (IRE) bobbled a bit at the start, recovered and assumed early command, showed the way into the first turn, set moderate fractions while
prompted into the backstretch run, dueled GRACE PERIOD into the far turn, lost the lead into upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
MADAME GAZELLE rated nicely off of the solid early pace, tracked two to three wide into the turn, roused into upper stretch and took command into the
drive, drew to a clear lead at mid-stretch, kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth and held safely in the late stages. JULIET'S KITCHEN settled off of
the solid early pace, raced three then four wide into the turn and improved position at the quarter marker, full of run into the stretch, chased MADAME
GAZELLE approaching the furlong pole, could not reel in the winner into deep stretch and was a clear second best. GENTLE JULIA unhurried away from
the start, trailed in the early going, guided three to four wide into the turn and trailed to the quarter pole, asked for run into the stretch, gained ground at the
furlong marker but still trailed at mid-stretch, rallied into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winners in deep stretch and won the nod for third. BACALAR
settled off of the solid early pace, saved ground approaching the turn, got caught in tight nearing the three-eighths pole and checked off of heels at that
station, saved ground into the stretch, improved position at the furlong marker, closed into the final sixteenth and just missed for third. BOBBY'S GENIE
allowed to settle in the early running, raced outside of rivals approaching the turn and went four then three wide nearing the quarter marker, chased into the
stretch, made a mild late rally and was outfinished for third. EM N HOLL'S FIESTA settled off of the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn and lost
position at the quarter marker, shifted two wide for the stretch drive and did not offer a late response. BRONZE GIRL forwardly placed away from the start,
tracked the quick early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and raced closest to the loose pacesetter approaching the quarter pole, lost position
into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. HER PERFECT VISION blasted out of the gate and assumed early command, drew to a clear lead and set
a solid pace heading to the half-mile marker, extended the lead into the turn and went three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, led into upper stretch,
overtaken heading to the furlong grounds and stopped in the late stages.
