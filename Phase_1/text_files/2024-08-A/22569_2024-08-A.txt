bid through the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. MOONSAFE settled off the early pace, moved up three wide near the quarter pole and raced evenly
with no final bid racing from the far outside. ASUE dueled for the early lead and weakened the final eighth of a mile. TRIXIE'S TIME dropped back early on,
saved ground through the far turn and had no response.

TWIXTER showed good early foot, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure. SECRETARY AT WAR tracked the early leader from the inside,
challenged under strong urging through the far turn, raced five wide into the upper stretch and missed in a game effort. LAKE NAKURU settled off the early
going, raced two to three wide around the far turn, raced seven wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. HIDDEN PROMISE stalked the early pace
two deep from the outside and faded. PURPLE SHIRT lost ground to race far back and never threatened.

HI HEELED WARRIOR set his own uncontested early pace and drew off to be well clear under strong handling. SPECTACULLARI chased the early pace,
raced two deep near the quarter pole, kept on but was no match for the winner. KESTENNA (GB) was shuffled back at the break, trailed early on, moved up
through the far turn, drifted through the stretch to race from the far outside and improved position. CARLY HUSTLE settled off the early going, raced three
wide near the quarter pole and lacked a rally. MOON POOL was unhurried early on, raced from the inside into the upper stretch and had no response. NOT
A TRACE forwardly placed to lay up close and gave way.

V MART sprinted to a clear early lead, raced in hand around the far turn and held safe under steady pressure. BROKENHEARTED dropped back off the
early going, raced five wide into the upper stretch and slowly closed in on the winner in a game effort. NORTHWOODS was unhurried early on, raced four
wide around the far turn and needed more in the drive for the top pair. MY MAN WOODY was under a hard chase early and faded the final eighth of a mile.
GRUMPY BROOKSIE settled off the early pace setters and failed to respond. NOTORIOUS REY urged early from the outside, raced wide into the upper
stretch and tired. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

early on near the inside, raced five wide into the upper stretch, kept on but was no match for the winner. PACIFIC STATES urged early on under a hard
chase, raced the inside past the quarter pole and weakened off the top pair through the stretch. COCOA BANANA veered out at the start, lost ground
through the far turn, raced wide into the lane and never menaced. KUTIA lost ground to race far back and was eased up on through the stretch.
