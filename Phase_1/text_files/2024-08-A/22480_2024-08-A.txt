Footnotes
CEE'NCEESGREYTNESS broke out, but was away alertly on the break, rated kindly while tucked in on the fence behind the pacesetter, shifted out, off the
rail midway around the bend, posed the main threat in the three path entering the stretch. SHES A DARLING broke out on the start, emerged from the pack
with a clear lead at the half, opened up mildly by midturn, improved the advantage at the top of the stretch, stubbornly fought to the wire but was caught in
the last jump for the win. LANEY GRACE was part of the group at the rear, three deep outside foes down the backside, was roused three eighths out,
started to reach for more ground inside through the turn, skimmed the fence , taking closer order at the top of the stretch and finished with purpose to be a
clear third when crossing the finish line. BRIT tracked three deep outside foes along the backside, loomed four wide around rivals in the turn, was in the hunt
still four wide outside runners straightening out for home but was one paced in the stretch to settle on the fringes. DISGRUNTLEDPELICAN travelled on the
rail in the trail group with four furlongs remaining, was urged on the fence making no impact throughout the turn, shifted four wide at the top of the lane and
passed a weary foe outside to the wire. ANNIA CORNIFICIA F stalked in the third flight at the back between horses at the half, made no headway outside a
runner through the turn, shifted out to the five path for the drive but made little presence to the finish line. IMPRESSIVE STYLE tracked in the two path
between rivals along the backside, kept pace with the frontrunner while in the three path with horses on both sides around the bend, had no more to offer
turning for home and yielded on the fence at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
SPARKLET emerged from the foursome while on the rail to have a slim lead entering the turn, continued up top by a narrow margin around the bend,
opened up in a flash at the top of the stretch and coasted home impressively for a dominant victory. DESROCHERS had a nice set up, watching the
contesting quartet along the backstretch, was poised, waiting for the cue to go through the turn, shifted out to be in four path entering the stretch and won
the duel for the place share, far back from the long-gone winner. PANYARD TAP was in the second flight three wide outside horses to begin, started to rally,
when surging between foes in midturn, angled out to the five path straightening for home, battled outside for the place share but had to settle for third money
in the end. GOLD BONANZA was in tight between challengers at the start to be ahead of only one rival down the backside, crept closer on the fence
through the turn, shifted to be three wide for the drive and showed good late energy to close in a get a minor reward. SWERVIN MERVYN veered inwards
on the start, prompted the pace three wide between horses down the backstretch, chased three wide outside foes on the turn, battled for the place share in
upper stretch but ran evenly to the wire and was outfinished in the last sixteenth. SING DIXIE was situated near the rear, four deep outside rivals, made no
improvement four wide around the turn, shifted out to the six path turning for home and picked up a couple of runners in deep stretch. HARD RELOAD was
squeezed on the break, travelled in the second flight with runners on both sides at the five eighths marker, kept pace taking the shortest way around on the
bend, was in the mix for a share on the rail in the stretch drive but lacked a finish in the final furlong. SOUPER ICONIC pressed the issue between horses in
the two path down the back straight, continued to be forwardly placed, vying between rivals up top on the turn, started to weaken in upper stretch and
retreated by the sixteenth pole. JACK was unhurried to trail in the beginning, could still see the field around the turn, started a mild run turning for home on
the fence, had to be steadied sharply at the furlong marker and regrouped late to pass some at the wire. JOHNNY GOLD was roughed up between horses
on the break, stalked near the rear between foes after that beginning, made no progress when hard ridden throughout the turn, drifted in while urged
right-handed at the eighth pole and had nothing to show in deep stretch. FOREST FLASH broke out on the start, was in the mix up front four deep along the
backside, was asked for more three furlongs out, offered no response around the bend, was empty for the stretch drive and was not persevered with in the
final furlong.

Footnotes
HANK OLLIE was content to rate kindly just off the pacesetter down the backstretch, hounded the frontrunner through the turn, turned up the pressure to bid
four wide at the top of the lane, inched closer to the lead with a furlong to go and finally wore down the stubborn rival who set all the fractions all through the
race just before the finish line. WALTER ME LAD took command from the start, dictated the pace while shadowed by the winner around the bend, dug in
near the fence clinging onto the lead with a furlong to run, continued to battle but was just outkicked late by the winner a few strides before the wire.
STORMIN DAVE was nestled on the rail, watching the front two down the backstretch, continued to keep a close eye on the engaged pair around the turn,
could not go on through the stretch to threaten the lead duo but did stay on determinedly to secure the third place share at the wire. LOBBY BAR stalked in
the third flight outside rivals in the early stages of the race, was in range of the leaders, six wide in upper stretch and finished up mildly to be a fringe player
in the end. ENDLESS SUNSET co-trailed on the outside in the back straight, began to pass runners three wide outside with three eighths left to go, angled
out seven wide turning for home and found more late to pass a couple of rivals in deep stretch. REPEAT THE HEAT tracked the front duo, just outside in the
early stages, took closer order to be in thick of things five wide straightening for home, could offered a rally when urged for more in mid-stretch and gave
way with a furlong from the wire. TOURIST'S DREAM co-trailed on the inside down the backside, offered a mild run with horses on either side three furlongs
out, shifted out to be in the six path for the drive but could only finish up one paced to the wire. ORPHAN HALLIE settled in midfield between rivals, could
not keep up, losing ground and position throughout the turn and failed to menace inside down the stretch.

Footnotes
CAHIRA'S BLESSING got away alertly and quickly sped clear, dictated the pace up the backstretch, was still well clear turning for home, began to shorten
stride in the stretch but held safe while being kept to the task. ROSA settled mid-pack inside, bided time saving ground throughout both turns, came out
three then four wide in the stretch, closed the gap on the leader but was only second best. DEVIL'S BIT tucked in near but off the rail in behind the leading
pair, was off the rail a bit more up the backstretch, began to advance past the three-eighths and ridden along three wide by the five-sixteenths, came out a
path or two more in the drive, evened out in the lane but kept on under steady urging to secure show honors. LADY ONYX (IRE) was coaxed forward from
the start then settled in off the leader, stalked that one from off the rail, moved out a bit in the stretch, was outkicked for the minor awards by rivals inside
and out. SARATOGA VISION unhurriedly brought up the rear, swung six wide turning for home, showed mild late interest. PEMBERLEY settled outside a
rival mid-pack, was encouraged along about the five-sixteenths, angled out a bit past the quarter pole, was not a late threat.

Footnotes
BACHELOR PAD was up front from the onset, dueling with a rival in the beginning, was engaged with another runner to his inside by the half, put away that
challenger at the quarter pole, braced, for yet another competitor to his outside in upper stretch and under a well rationed front end ride, disposed of that foe
with an eighth to go for an impressive win up front. JAMIESTA was in tight soon after the start, trailing down the backside, started to unleash a un going
around horses at the quarter pole, was full of run in the six-path turning for home and closed in smartly to nail the place share right at the wire. ECHO WITH
LAUGHTER was in the mix up front early, then was reined in to track the front pair on the rail down the backstretch, moved in smartly two wide at the
quarter pole, loomed the only threat in upper stretch, was quickly repelled by the frontrunning winner who had something left and faded late to lose second
money right at the finish line. VICTORY MARCH stalked near the rear on the fence along the backstretch, was shuffled back to last at the quarter pole,
found another gear with an eighth left to run and surged late to be involved in the photo for the place share at the wire. THREE SONNY SIDEUP had a
tangled start to begin, was hustled to duel inside early on, tracked the lead duo outside at the half, was under a vigorous ride while keeping pace around the
turn, resurged between rivals fighting for the show money in mid-stretch, could not continue on and faded at the seventy yard marker. SALVATOR MUNDI
sat all alone in mid-division down the back straight, was asked midway on the turn but to little response and lacked a bid in the stretch running. MANNIX
(IRE) pressed the pace issue on the rail at the half, had no more to give and began to weaken in midturn while chasing the winner and emptied out, stopping
on the fence with a furlong remaining. SILENT MIRACLE was ahead of only one rival along the backside, offered a mild run three furlongs out passing some
runners, could not sustain the rally by upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ZISISIT (IRE) exchanged a very light brush at the start, was well-placed just off and outside the leader heading into the first turn, stalked that one two to
three wide, edged nearer willingly on the far turn, bid and took the lead at the quarter pole, drew clear under urging and held safe. PERHAPS TONIGHT
(IRE) settled mid-pack talking from outside, was put to urging near the five-sixteenths racing three to four wide and within range of the leaders, kept on in
the stretch while drifting out a path or two and just held on enough to share the place while no late threat to the winner. DESTINY RO tucked in two to three
wide racing at the back and outside a rival, fanned six deep turning for home, gained steadily and slowly widest in the lane and got a dead-heat for second.
MI CORAZON settled mid-pack inside, moved out chasing from off the rail through the far turn, asked for more by the quarter pole racing two to three wide,
kept on evenly in the stretch. ARRIVISTE broke a step slowly, unhurriedly brought up the rear, swung six to seven wide, was never close enough to
menace. ADDENDUM was coaxed clear early and shifted in, set the pace from inside, was challenged on the far turn, faltered and faded. LADY XI was
reserved at the back inside, failed to threaten.

Footnotes
ALICIA'S KID had a slim lead down the backstretch, edged clear with five sixteenths from the line, spurted away by upper stretch and was kept to the task to
hold safe in the end. SOUPER RIVER settled on the fence in midfield, began to pick up the bit when urged midway around the bend, angled out four wide,
gathering momentum turning for home and found his best stride late to get his head down right at the wire to place share. FAST BOAT TO SKYE tracked
three wide outside rivals in the early stages, battled three wide between horses for the place share in upper stretch, ran determinedly to the finish line but
just lost out on the runners up share at the line. ONE MORE BREW chased the pacesetter on the rail down the back straight, could not keep with the winner
through the turn, dueled gamely inside down the stretch for second money but was unfortunately on the losing end of a tight three way photo at the finish
and settled for a minor role in the end. TRICKY MAGICIAN traded bumps with the outside rival on the break, recovered to track two wide between horses
down the backstretch, ran evenly through the turn and continued to be one paced on the fence in the stretch running. BLUE MAX had one rival beaten along
the backstretch, started to make a move when splitting foes five sixteenths from home and showed some late interest going between runners in deep
stretch. MASTER SPY stalked near the back of the pack three deep outside rivals, made a brief run, going around foes five wide midway around the bend,
continued in the five path straightening out for the drive but could not get involved down the lane. MIDNIGHT ARKLE travelled in the two path, between
runners in mid-pack in the beginning, was asked for more three wide still with horses on both sides midturn, offered little run and had little to show in the
drive to the wire. COMMANDER JOE exchanged bumps with inside runner on the break, got the worst of it to trail down the backside, made little
progression when scrubbed on for run on the fence through the turn and failed to fire on the rail down the lane. SHADY EMPIRE sat alone in midfield by the
half, was coaxed four more while four wide with rivals on each side midpoint around the bend, travelled in the wrong direction at the quarter pole and
emptied out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ARASHI settled on the rail in mid-division into the first turn, progressed smartly on the fence down the back straight, patiently waited to move, nestled
behind the lead group looking for a seam around the final bend, shot up the fence in mid-stretch and drew off connivingly late to be much the best when
crossing the finish line. ASK IN MY NAME settled in mid-pack between foes on the first turn, took closer order three deep outside horses in the second
flight, tracking the lead pair along the backstretch, was reeling the leader, closing in three wide under a ride by the quarter pole, loomed in the four path at
the top of the stretch, was no match for the over powering winner with a furlong to go but did prevail for the secondary battle in deep stretch. GHOSTLY
SPITFIRE had no early foot and trailed in the early stages, began to pick up runners outside midway on the final turn, swung out reaching for more ground
six wide for the drive and closed strongly for the place share in the lane, could not get there in time and had to settle for a clear third in the end.
BASKETBALL JONES tracked the lead pair while travelling on the fence, watched the engaged twosome along the backside, moved in three wide, circling
runners with three eighths remaining, poked his head in front for a moment in the four path turning for home, needed more late to play a role in the end but
stalled in the final sixteenth to settle on the fringes. KINGSCOTE tracked the lead duo outside a rival in the first turn, was shuffled back, losing positions
along the backside, kept pace with others around the final bend and finished up willingly in the lane while battling for a minor role. BENLION stalked on the
rail close to the back in the first turn, shifted outside, three deep in mid-backstretch, crept closer through the turn, angled out five wide for the drive but
lacked a finishing kick to the wire. SECRET STORM was bumped outside on the break, regrouped to take this field into the first turn, set the pace along the
backside, maintained a slim advantage by the quarter marker, was collared on each side in the two path turning for home, offered little resistance and
backed away on the fence in the last sixteenth. SNOOKERED stalked near the rear just outside around the first bend, was relegated to last while taking the
shortest way around at the quarter pole, was in range for a small piece of the prize on the rail straightening out for home, could not find more late and
passed a tiring rival in the final furlong. DESIGNATED HITTER broke inwards to begin, prompted the pace outside in the beginning, continued to hound the
frontrunner down the backside until the half, was urged on while chasing the pacesetter with runners closing in on both sides with three furlongs remaining,
began to fade by the quarter pole and retreated with a furlong left to run.
