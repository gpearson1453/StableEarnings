Footnotes
AINTNOSHAKIN KID was well placed sitting just off the embattled duo through early stages, moved up three wide to challenge for the lead at the quarter
pole, vied outside of LUS TIME while holding a slight edge a furlong out, then shook free and kicked clear. JACKIE SPARROW was ridden along off the
early leaders, moved up closer three to four wide late on the turn, came wider into upper stretch, came in a couple paths, sustained bid and got a nose up
for place. LU'S TIME vied for the lead in opening stages, continued to match strides into the turn and took on the challenge of the eventual winner at the
quarter pole, fought back a furlong out then failed to match strides, weakened and got nipped for place. SUNSET FOR SANDRA raced off the early pace,
swung three wide into upper stretch and improved position. DIXIE SURPRISE was not far back in the early going, chased two wide around the turn and
lacked a rally in the lane. BORN FEARLESS raced in the back, cut the corner entering the lane and failed to make an impact. MIND YOUR MO vied for the
lead in opening stages, battled on around the turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SKYBOOM dueled outside of TAKEOFF TIME in early stages, battled on around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, widened advantage and held
clear. GLAD VON D raced off the embattled duo into the turn, hustled along three wide into upper stretch, sustained bid and finished second best.
ESPERANZA'S SPIRIT was off slow at the start and raced in the back, steadily picked up the pace, came three wide into upper stretch and finished with
good response. ANNIETIME chased the pace near midpack, hustled along two to three wide upper stretch then angled to the inside and ran on evenly.
LUCKIE GOLDIE raced off the pace, cut the corner entering the lane and failed to respond. TAKEOFF TIME dueled with the eventual winner in early stages,
battled on around the turn then tired in the drive. OUR LOCKETS ROCKET never menaced.

Footnotes
C'MON LUCKY was forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked up the backstretch, vied outside of SHES SOLID SILVER for the lead around the final
turn, battled on into the final furlong, dug in gamely and drew clear. SHE'S SOLID SILVER raced up close around the first turn, pressed the pace up the
backstretch, vied inside of CMON LUCKY around the far turn, came out wider entering the head of the lane, fought on gamely with rival to the sixteenth pole
then failed to be a match and had to settle for second best. NATUSIA tracked the pace along the inside, launched a two wide bid entering the head of the
lane, sustained a steady effort and secured a share. ESPRIT ROUGE raced in the back through early stages, cut the corner entering upper stretch then
shifted out, launched a bid and improved position without threatening. BIZ B QUICK raced off the early pace, hustled along four paths wide into upper
stretch and lacked a needed rally. HARD SPIRITS rated off the early leaders, saved ground then tipped two wide and raced between foes into the final turn,
hustled along into upper stretch but had no response. OLIVIA'S HOPE led the way around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch, got collared by duo
nearing the quarter pole and tired in the drive. CLIMB TO GLORY raced midpack around the first turn, was not too far back in early stages, failed to advance
when called upon and steadily weakened.
