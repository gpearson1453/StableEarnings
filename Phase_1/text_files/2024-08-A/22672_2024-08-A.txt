Footnotes
ROCK SOLID WORDS stalked the pace down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the half mile marker to run down the leader, drove past at the
eighth pole to a clear win. G'S STORM raced off the pace down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the turn for the long drive and proved second
best. HALF A BUCK prompted the pace from the inside to the turn then fell back but made a rebid in the stretch to pass tiring foe and saved the show.
JAMAICAN ME raced near the back to the turn while racing wide throughout and finished evenly. COLT'S BRIM was void of speed while saving ground and
made a late rail bid in the stretch to improve position. PRICED RIGHT shot away from the gate to a clear lead but was caught in upper stretch and tired.
THUNDERTAKESDALEAD raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SKY HIGH SUSAN went to the front to a pressured lead around the first turn then drew clear down the backstretch and was kept to task in the stretch drive.
DEROUTANTE vied for the lead from three wide around the first turn then settled off the pace down the backstretch, made a rail bid on the final turn but
couldn't catch the leader and was best of the rest. PINCHING PENNIES tracked the leaders through the final turn then made a mild bid to pass tiring rivals.
LITTLE E raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the turn, shifted inside at the quarter pole but was empty. I
DONT KNOW EITHER raced near the back while saving ground to no avail. TIFFANY'S FERRARI pressed the pace from the inside around the first turn
then chased the leader to the final turn and faded. SUPER ET trailed and was outrun.

CAJUN ACES raced off the pace around the first turn but was squeezed and shuffled back near the six furlong marker then settled in mid pack down the
backstretch, made a three wide bid in mid turn and engaged the leader in upper stretch to battle to the wire but was able to inch away late to prevail.
STRAWBERRY SUNDAE prompted the pace from two wide down the backstretch then engaged the leader at the three furlong marker and edged clear
near the end of the bent but was challenged down the stretch while fighting gamely and gave way grudgingly. AVERI EVER AFTER trailed the field down
the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker to advance on the leaders, tipped to four wide in upper stretch for the late rally.
STAR'S DREAM raced in the middle of the pack and passed tiring rivals. FITTS N STARTS tracked the leader from the inside on the backstretch then
shifted out to three wide around the final turn but failed to menace. SHE'S TAKIN OVER was allowed to settle near the back while saving ground to no avail.
SHE'S GONE D'WILD stalked the pace from three or four wide to the final turn and retreated. PAYTON'S INDIAN went to the front to a clear lead down the
backstretch then was headed at the three furlong marker and tired.

to the top of the stretch, then dug in to inch away but was caught late and gave way grudgingly. TOOTOO TOURIST stalked the pace from three wide down
the backstretch move up to challenge for the lead at the three furlong marker and weakened. LEXINGTON DIVA raced at the back down the backstretch
then moved up on the turn and tipped out to five wide in upper stretch to make the late run but was not enough. CHAPELLETE saved ground around the
first turn to press the pace from the inside to midway down the backstretch and faded on the turn. SUPER STORMY was allowed to settle around the first
turn then made a mild bid on the backstretch but failed to menace. BENT HALO raced off the pace down around the first turn then prompted to pace down

JERRY'S EIGHTY showed good speed to the turn then was headed at the three furlong marker and battled to deep stretch but drifted in slightly at the near
the sixteenth pole but kept on to fend off the inside rival and held on. NO WHITE FLAGS rushed up to prompt the pace from the inside to the top of the
stretch then tipped out to two wide but shifted back in to make a late rail bid and just missed. JOSH'S DREAM showed no early speed through the turn then
shifted out to four wide in upper stretch and had a late kick but was too late. PESO IN MY POCKET raced off the pace to the turn then moved up to engage
the leader at the three furlong marker and battled to the eighth pole and weakened. PICKENS showed brief speed away from the gate, raced wide
throughout and was not a threat. DOUBLEDIAMOND DEAL was roused to contention from four wide at the three furlong marker and gave way. A

Footnotes
CARTHAGE CAJUN was allowed to settle near the back down around the first turn then made a middle move to engage the leader near the quarter pole
and cruised home. SHARP SPARK was reluctant to load then went to the front to co-lead inside of SILVER ASSASSIN to the three furlong marker, edged
away on the turn but was collared at the quarter pole, fought gamely to mid stretch and was second best. SILVER ASSASSIN hustled to the front to co-lead
outside of SHARP SPARK to the three furlong marker and faded on the turn but stayed on for the show. HARD TO COME BY raced in the middle of the
pack while slowly moving up the rail on the backstretch but had to steady slightly entering the final turn, kept on around the turn while staying inside and had
to steady slightly again near the eighth pole but made a strong late bid to improve position. SLEW CITY HENRY raced off the pace from between horses to
the final turn but lacked the late response. SAM'S PROMISE was unhurried to the final turn then moved between horses on the turn, angled out to four wide
at the quarter pole and showed a late kick but was not enough. LITTLE JONY broke well then settled off the pace on the inside but fell back on the final turn
and failed to menace. EL SMOOCH was forwardly placed from three wide and made a mild bid through the final turn and weakened. KING ARTHUR RIDGE
raced near the back from five wide but was not a threat. BRAZIL NUT raced in the middle of the pack from four wide down the backstretch and retreated.
HOWIT HAPPENED was restless in the gate and had an awkward start, raced in the middle of the pack to the final turn and gave way.
