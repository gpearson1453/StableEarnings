back in the early going, moved up from the inside down the backstretch, closed with a late rush to prove 2nd best. INCHHIGHATAHUNDRED raced in the
middle of the pack, moved up from the outside around the final turn but could not catch the top two late. REACH FOR THE ACES within striking distance
early, made an outside bid around the final turn to take a slight lead but could not match strides late. BREAKING STAR was hard to load, angled in at the
start to take the lead, battled throughout but weakened down the home stretch. BOSTON BLITZ raced in the rear early and was never a serious threat. KAH
NIGH showed little. ASTROLOGY WONOWON broke well, steadied early while getting in tight entering the first turn, dropped back down the backside and

Footnotes
PULPIT'S DREAM broke a step slow, broke in, trailed the field, moved up on the rail around the turn, angled out at the head of the stretch, split rivals, rallied
and got up for the win, proving much the best. MISS DEALORITY vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, took the lead down the home stretch,
but proved no match late for the winner. BIG BLUE ANGEL dueled on the front end, raced close throughout, but proved no match for the top two. OCEAN
JET pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn and faded. CRITICAL VELOCITY lacked early speed, raced evenly near the back and was never a
threat. LADY CHERYL'S SONG challenged for the early advantage and dropped back.

THE CALLING STONE lunged at the start, racing near the back, moved up three wide around the turn, pulled away down the lane and proved the best.
RUNTOLIVE pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn, took the lead, but proved no match for the winner. RUSTY'S SUNRISE lacked early speed,
saved ground around the turn, made a wide bid and got up for third. COAL DANCER raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout and weakened
inside. GOOD BY FAITH raced evenly near the middle of the pack and lacked a bid. RULED BY SPIRIT vied for the early advantage and faded. HOLIDAY
DOUBLE void of early speed, bobbled down the backside and was never a threat. GOGO BOBBYJO dueled on the front end and dropped back.

Footnotes
MR MIDWAY broke out, went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and held on well for the win. SONYA KNOWS BETTER unhurried in the beginning,
racing outside down the backside, moved up around the turn, racing between rivals, made a late bid, four wide and was gaining on the winner. CREEKSIDE
pressed the pace, raced close throughout and proved no match for the top two. JEFFROW raced evenly near the middle of the pack, saved ground and was
no factor. UP N GONE always raced near the back and showed little. MOMENT OF STARDOM raced within contention, faded and trailed late.

Footnotes
BABY JANE raced within striking distance, made a late bid and drove by CUSTOMERUNHAPPY down the stretch for the win. CUSTOMERUNHAPPY vied
for the early lead, took command, but couldn't match strides with the winner down the lane. SAUCY GEM dueled on the front end, forwardly placed
throughout, proved no match for the top two, but held on for third. HARD CANDY KISSES lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn, made a late
bid and was outfinished for the show position. SPECIAL FEATURE raced near the middle of the field, made a mild inside bid, but was no factor. SWEET
THIRTEEN void of early speed, raced outside around the turn, showed late interest, but was no threat. COUSHATTA CUTIE broke out, was an early factor
and faded. SHELBI'S STAR lacked early speed and was never close. QUICK BITE raced evenly near the back and showed little. GIRL LIKES BLING
showed brief speed, saved ground around the turn and dropped back. SEND IT SOARING forced out at the break, pressed the pace and retreated to the
rear.
