mid stretch then weakened. ROGER MCQUEEN pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, gained a narrow lead nearing the furlong marker then
weakened MASTER offered a mild bid on the far turn then came up empty. NOBLE BEHAVIOR well placed, failed to respond. VENETIAN DREAM vied for
the lead three wide and was through after a half.

SOCIALBUTTERFLYTAM was bumped at the start, allowed to settle, responded with a burst of speed along the rail through deep stretch and was along in
time. DANCE MY WAY was taken inside early, slipped through along the rail to make the lead entering the stretch, maintainer advantage in the two path
until the final stages then couldn't handle the winner. LIAM'S LASS was bumped at the start, pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead near
the quarter pole then was outfinished. CANDYMONIUM was bumped and squeezed at the start then failed to menace. FIONA stalked the pace three wide
and weakened in the stretch. CORNER KICK drifted out bumping LIAMS LASS causing a chain reaction of bumping to his outside soon after the start, set a
pressured pace for nearly a half then weakened. KEY TO SUCCESS trailed, pulled up on the turn and was walked off.

handed urging through mid stretch then finished full of run under a strong hand ride to win going away. THELMA LUCILLE was bumped at the start, offered
a strong bid three wide into the stretch then was no match for the winner. THIRTY SOMETHING sped to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace
along the inside past the five sixteenths pole then was outfinished. SOMETHING LUCKY was bumped at the start, trailed early and passed tiring rivals in
the four path. COWGIRLS HUMOR bore in bumping SOMETHING LUCKY causing a chain reaction of bumping to her inside then failed to menace.

TEAM MOM NOT BRUH battled for the lead two wide then length of the backstretch and through the far turn, surged under right handed urging through the
stretch and won going away. GRAY ENOUGH battled with the winner along the inside into the far turn, was taken back before the quarter pole, shifted out to
the six path then was no match while well clear for second. ZIPPY ZINNY well placed inside, began to close ground on the far turn, altered course to the
seven path entering the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. SAKONNA trailed into the stretch and passed tiring rivals along the inside. FLATTERING
HEART stalked the early pace three wide and was through after a half. NOT TODAY tracked the leaders four then three wide into the far turn then gave
way.

COUNTEVERYBLESSING pressed the pace two wide into the clubhouse turn, dropped back a bit and settled along the rail, waited while boxed in through
the far turn, shifted out two wide at the top of the stretch, rallied determinedly under a strong hand ride and was along in time. MAMAS HOME COOKING
broke in front, set the pace, drew clear in upper stretch then couldn't handle the winner in the final stages but was well clear for second. GUESS AGAIN
pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened. MOBIL MISSION well placed, failed to respond. KENNEDY'S CAMELOT failed to menace.
MARQUITOS M offered a mild bid four wide nearing the far turn then came up empty. LIVING THE DREAM trailed throughout.
