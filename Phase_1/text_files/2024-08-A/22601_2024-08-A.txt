Footnotes
SO THERE SHE WAS brushed leaving the gate, chased from inside, coaxed along leaving the backstretch, asked right handed on the turn, bid inside the
top trio at the three-sixteenths pole, dueled with SHOWERS and took over in upper stretch, fought with that rival to midstretch and drew clear in the final
sixteenth. SHOWERS forwardly placed from outside, bid three deep at the quarter pole, led four deep into stretch, drifted in at the top of the lane, lost
command shortly after, battled back to midstretch, then yielded in the late stages. POWER CONNECTION applied light pressure to the leader from outside
early, chased three wide on the turn, bid between at the quarter pole, had her path taken briefly at the top of the stretch and kept on for a clear third. HAPPY
SUE grabbed the early lead and showed the way up the backstretch, led two wide on the turn then was confronted by a pair of rivals a quarter mile out, lost
command entering the lane and gave way. ACQUITTED tracked the pacesetter from off the rail, took the turn three then four wide and came up empty in the
drive. AMORITA got brushed and crowded in the beginning, trailed up the backstretch, took the turn five wide and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
MY SUMMER DREAM settled outside a rival, drew closer on the turn, swung four wide into the lane, rallied to the front midstretch, cleared with a sixteenth
left to run and held safely over the runner-up. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN trailed in the early going, went two wide into the turn, roused approaching the
quarter pole, swung five wide leaving the bend, closed well under left then right handed urging for the place but could not reach the winner. FORGIVING
SPIRIT vied between rivals then pressed into the turn, remained alongside the leader in the two path around the bend, took over at the eighth pole, shifted
out and impeded rival shortly after and flattened to third. MYNUMEROUNO (AUS) sat off the pace and moved inside, waited along the rail on the turn then
shifted to the two path nearing the lane, lacked room in upper stretch and churned on to earn a minor award. SO I'M TOLD away quickly and vied three
deep early, remained close up three wide through the turn, got bumped and had to take up past the eighth pole and was ridden out to the wire. SEISMIC
SPIRIT (IRE) stalked from inside, waited around the turn, tipped out at the top of the lane, got impeded by FORGIVING SPIRITY and bumped with SO I'M
TOLD midstretch and could not regain momentum. MAMBA ON THREE ran off behind the gate and was brought back, coaxed in the beginning then vied
inside a pair of rivals, inched ahead nearing the turn, carried a short lead through the bend, lost command at the eighth pole and weakened. FOLLOWING
AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED FORGIVING SPIRIT FROM THIRD TO SIXTH FOR SHIFTING OUT AND IMPEDING SEISMIC SPIRIT
(IRE) PAST THE EIGHTH POLE, COSTING THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
FOR ALL MANKIND cleared and crossed over, took pressured at the half-mile pole, put away outer rival midway around the bend, drew away under light
hand urging and padded the margin in deep stretch. TRANCHE stalked from inside, tipped out at the quarter pole, could not make any headway on the
winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. MANITOWISH coaxed along at the back early then passed a rival and chased three deep into the
turn, eased further out and raced in the five path turning for home and was along for the show. GYPSY TEARS climbed bit chasing from inside then moved
out and went between rivals leaving the backstretch, angled four wide around the turn, could not rally and lost third. KING AND COUNTRY had his path
taken early, started to climb and dropped back, trailed two wide into the turn the moved inside, cut the corner into the lane and could not make an impact.
CORSO'S PICK raced up close inside FOR ALL MANKIND then had to steady briefly when that rival crossed over, moved up to press the issue at the
half-mile pole, could not keep up with the pacesetter midway around the bend, got floated out a bit a quarter mile out and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
NESSO'S LASTHARRAH stepped to the front and took the rail position, set all the pace to the stretch, then drew away under hand urging and flagging from
a right handed crop. RASTAMAN VIBE stalked along the rail, roused a quarter mile out, hugged the rail to the stretch, was closest in pursuit with a furlong
remaining, could not gain on the winner late and had to settle for second best. PROMISSIO rated between foes then outside a rival, crept closer three deep
leaving the backstretch, asked three wide around the far turn, could not rally in the lane but kept on to hold the show. SIENNOIS (IRE) tracked along the
fence, moved out leaving the backstretch, chased between at the five-sixteenths pole, continued two wide into the lane and got edged for third. CATHAL
(IRE) forwardly placed three deep then moved into the two path around the clubhouse turn, flanked the leader into the second bend, ridden along into the
stretch and weakened. NIGHT OUT sat off the pace in the two path, chased three deep at the five-sixteenths pole and was outrun.

Footnotes
NOONI was a bit fractious in the gate, went up to take control with CASALU applying light pressure from outside, cleared that rival with a quarter mile left to
run, roused at the top of the lane and put to right handed urging, then held safely under steady handling in deep stretch. VODKA WITH A TWIST was
fractious loading behind the gate, settled off the pace, drew closer in the three path on the turn, was closest in pursuit entering the final furlong but finished
evenly late. CASALU raced outside NOONI in the early going, could not keep pace with the winner approaching the quarter pole, chased in the two path
entering the lane and weakened under left handed urging. NIGHT BEACON had her path taken then climbed a bit at the back, moved inside and drew
closer up the backstretch, ridden along on the turn while saving ground, asked right handed past the quarter pole, then faded down the lane.

Footnotes
JEWELED SHILLELAGH set the pace along the inside under pressure, shook free from ADIOS COLE at the quarter pole, drew away in upper stretch, led
clear into the final sixteenth, then held over a late run from the runner-up. NASHOBA'S JOY tucked inside at the back, moved off the rail in the middle
stages, progressed three then four wide around the far turn, rallied from outside, latched onto the winner late but ran out of time. CARIBBEAN KING stalked
two wide, tipped three wide at the quarter pole, lacked a bid in the stretch run but stayed on to secure third. HOT LEGS ROMOLO settled off the pace
outside a rival, raced two to three wide into the lane, churned on in the stretch but could not get by for third. BELMONT BILL stalked the top pair from inside,
saved ground through the far turn, put to right handed urging in the lane but weakened in the furlong grounds. JACK KEROUAC moved inside and raced in
mid-pack, coaxed along the fence through the far turn, lacked room behind rivals from upper stretch to the sixteenth pole and was too late to make a run
once in the clear. SEA OF CORTEZ (IRE) took up when running on heels early, moved inside traveling near the back, got boxed in on the far turn, tipped
out at the top of the lane and could not be a factor. FOXTROT HARRY raced towards the rear two wide early, trailed outside a rival into the stretch, moved
out in the lane and proved no menace. ADIOS COLE prompted the pace from outside, lost touch with the leader at the quarter pole, chased in the two path
approaching the stretch and weakened.

STYLE CAT showed the way early under pressure from outer rival, fought on even terms around the bend, inched ahead in upper stretch, shook free
approaching the sixteenth pole and drew away. CHARMZ AWAY raced up close outside the top pair, driven three wide into the lane, stayed within striking
distance through the final furlong but could only get by SPEEDY WILSON for the place. SPEEDY WILSON off slow in the beginning, chased near the back
and angled in for the turn, saved ground to the stretch, cornered nicely into the lane, rallied and got up for third. WHISKYGINANDBRANDY prompted the
pace from outside to the turn, headed the leader around the bend, kept the pressure on to midstretch, then faltered in the last sixteenth and lost the show.
PRINCE DOLCE raced in mid-pack three wide into the turn, moved over to the two path, then spun three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. WINDS
OF FREEDOM broke a bit slow when bobbling at the start, stalked the leaders from inside, pushed on through the turn, moved off the fence in the drive and
faded. SILVERADO STORM bumped leaving the gate, tracked wide up the backstretch, took the turn five then four wide and weakened. HOTHEAD off slow
and bothered by inner rival, climbed at the back and moved inside, angled between rivals at the three-eighths pole, steered out further and came six wide
into the stretch but failed to be a factor. WAR IS HELL bumped by inner rival at the start, chased from off the pace, took the turn two to three wide and was
outrun. DROP THE BIT broke out to bother SILVERADO STORM a bit, forwardly placed four deep up the backstretch, traveled four then five wide on the
turn and tired.

ANISETTE (GB) coaxed from the gate then settled inside near the back, gained ground in the middle stages, chased three then two wide on the far turn,
closed in and drew alongside UNCORKED (AUS) midstretch, headed that rival at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. UNCORKED (AUS) traveled in
mid-pack along the fence, closed the gap on the leader up the backstretch, tipped two wide then moved back inside on the far turn, took over in upper
stretch, collared by the winner approaching the sixteenth pole, relinquished the lead shortly after and managed hold on for second. FUENTE OVEJUNA
(GB) unhurried in the opening stages in the two path, moved into range leaving the backstretch, took aim three wide leaving the far turn, challenged in upper
stretch, outkicked by the winner in deep stretch and finished determinedly to get up for second. LUCKY GIRL (IRE) tucked inside at the back of the field,
tipped two wide around EVER SMART late on the far turn, swung widest in the lane and finished well for a minor award. BELLABEL (IRE) dueled briefly
inside EVER SMART then stalked from inside, cut into the pacesetters lead on the backstretch, raced on even terms at the five-sixteenths pole, took over
and cleared quickly, showed the way two wide into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. EVER SMART dueled early
from outside then made a clear lead crossing the finish line for the first time, opened up a comfortable lead on the inside around the clubhouse turn, held a
diminished lead into the far turn, gave up the lead when headed at the five-sixteenths pole, chased along the rail and got put in a bit tight entering the lane,
eased in the final furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
GOLDENSUNRISE broke out but was also away quickest, took control and set the pace under pressure, cleared approaching the quarter pole and
remained unchallenged under urging to the line. PAT'S PADDOCK PICK chased off the inside, traveled two to there wide on the turn, angled to the rail past
the five-sixteenths pole, cut the corner into the stretch and finished willingly near the fence to earn the place honors. DEVIL AMONG US broke out, chased
early then moved up to apply pressure leaving the backstretch, lost touch with the leader a quarter mile out, spun three wide into the lane and stayed on to
secure third. DAMAZIO climbed early and dropped off the pace, raced outside a rival into the turn, navigated the bend two to three wide and kept on for a
minor award. THE BIG CHEESEOLA chased under coaxing outside a pair of rivals, pushed on three then four wide on the turn, asked right handed entering
the lane and needed to find more to threaten. POP D'ORO broke through the gate and was brought back around to reload, chased between then outside a
rival leaving the backstretch, angled out and exited the bend five wide and failed to rally when called upon. CAROL'S COMIC broke a step slow, chased on
the inside into the turn, lacked room in traffic on the turn then gained an opening on the rail at the quarter pole, cut the corner into the drive and could not
rally. SPIRITIST got bumped in the beginning, settled well off the rail, went four wide into the turn, six wide into the drive and failed to respond. PICKING IT
UP broke out and bumped SPIRITIST, traveled near the back in the early going, went four wide into the turn, quickly moved into the three path then angled
back out to exit the bend in the five path and proved no menace. DES DOIGTS hustled from inside early and raced up close, dropped back around the turn,
went two wide into the lane and tired. DAD'S JUBILEE fractious in the gate, tracked out of range on the inside, lost ground through the turn, went two to
three wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. ACCELERAY reluctant to load into the gate, broke out then lagged behind early, trailed on the
inside then two wide leaving the bend and was always outrun.
