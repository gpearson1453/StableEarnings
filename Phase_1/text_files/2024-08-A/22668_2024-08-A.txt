Footnotes
LITTLE HOT MESS moved up from between rivals to vie for command three wide, then made a bid on the turn and when cleared the inside two rivals
dropped to the two path leaving the five sixteenths, then shook clear leaving the bend and drew out in the furlong grounds to prove best while under a mild
drive. GETTOTHSTORYIMDONE was out-sprinted early and raced in the two path on the turn, angled out in the lane and finished well to gain the place
award late. BOUNTY KILLAH vied for the early lead on the outside, then pressed the winner four to three wide on the turn but faded in the final furlong
losing the place award. DIGITAL CURRENCY vied for the early lead two wide and in between rivals, fell back on the turn and faded. ESTRELLIS was off
slowly, then rushed up on the inside to vie for the lead and weakened on the trun. GOLDEN BOSS LADY stalked the early pace four wide and then was four
to five wide on the turn and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
TWEET AWAY ROBIN tracked the pace three wide and came five wide off the turn and then finished willingly and had a late surge to get up late to prove
best under a drive. R AVERIE LYNN set the early pace on the inside while unchallenged, was still clear by the furlong marker but was caught in the shadow
of the wire to just fail while being clearly second best. THEA'S THEME stalked the pace and was two wide on the turn, came four wide off the bend and
faded, bested rest. WIN DIXIE RONNIE was reserved early, advanced two wide on the turn and improved position late. SHE'S BULLETPROOF stumbled at
the break, then moved up to chase the pace four wide on the turn and came seven wide into the lane and was empty. A GIRL NAMED JAC was settled
early and then failed to menace. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE chased the early pace two wide, then was on the inside on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
ANAITA tracked the early pace three wide, moved out and came five wide into the lane, made a bid and edged clear in the furlong grounds to prove best
under right handed crop urging. SPEIGHTFUL SIS was well placed early and on the inside on the turn, tipped out three wide leaving the turn to make a bid
and was between rivals by the furlong marker and ran on well to the wire but was out-kicked by the winner, second best. ABOVE THE LIMIT dueled for the
lead and made a bid on the inside and came two wide off the turn while clear, then was headed nearing the furlong marker and faded, held show award.
TAK E LADY was rated along the inside and cut the corner leaving the turn and had a mild late kick but needed more. A NEW PEACE was bumped at the
start, settled and was two to three wide on the turn, came four wide off the turn and had a belated rally. HIPNOTIZADA stalked the pace three to two wide
and weakened. BAND SWEETHEART was reserved early, saved ground on the turn and was not a threat. PRINCESS RUNAWAY dueled for the lead on
the outside and was three wide on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
BRIGHT FORECAST stalked the early pace in between rivals, then was three wide on the turn, made a bid off the bend and slowly wore down the pace
setter to edged clear to prove best under a drive. SUSTENANCE set the pace while clear and came two wide off the bend and was still clear, dug in gamely
in the drive but could not hold off the winner while staying on for the place award. SUPER CONSTITUTION was well placed along the inside, came two wide
off the bend looking for room, then moved back to the inside to make a bid but needed more while clearly besting the rest. ETRETAT chased the pace and
was two wide on the turn but lacked the needed rally. ESTILO MAGICO was settled early and between rivals by the half mile marker, three to four wide on
the turn, came five wide off the bend and had no rally. KEANU broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, tracked the pace four wide and weakened.
QUIET REBEL was settled early, saved ground on the turn and was not a threat. JAY'S DELIGHT was bumped at the start, raced on the outside and was
wide on the turn while being no factor.

Footnotes
SABI was well rated on the inside, moved out to make a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole to take over in upper stretch and drew clear, then moved out
to take on the bid from RUM TUM TUGGER in the furlong grounds and held off that foe gamely to prove best under a drive. RUM TUM TUGGER was
allowed to settle early, made a three wide move on the far turn to move into contention, then made a four wide bid in the lane to loom boldly but hung late.
ALL SEWN UP was bumped at the start, reserved early on the inside, advanced on the backstretch, then continued that inside run on the far turn and
waited nearing the quarter pole, swung out three wide leaving the turn and had a mild kick but needed more. ART HANDLER was reserved early, advanced
three to four wide on the far turn but had no late kick. MUNGO was reserved early, came five wide into the lane but had no rally. JOHNNY FROM BOSTON
chased the pace three wide and weakened. DOWNPATRICK was keen early to set the pace on the inside while clear, then was headed on the far turn and
gave way in the lane. BUCK RUN tracked the pace two wide and tired. BALI RIDDIM was settled back three wide and was not a factor. WALKER'S GAP
was off slowly, then moved to the inside and never factored. BRAVE SAND RIDER was reluctant to load, then was four wide into the first turn, outside
pursuit and tired.

Footnotes
RUE CAMBON was allowed to settle early between rivals, then was two to three wide on the backstretch, moved to the inside on the far turn and advanced
in hand on the far turn, eased out by the quarter pole and came four wide off the turn, made a bid and edged clear in the furlong grounds to prove best
under a drive. LORRAINE (FR) was well rated on the inside to two wide, then made a two wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then took over three wide off
the turn and shook clear, but was headed by the winner by the furlong marker and could not go with that rivals while saving the place award. TARTAN
GREEN (IRE) was reserved on the inside, saved ground on the turn and angled out leaving the turn and closed well to just miss the place award. URBAN
STAR was allowed to settle along the inside but lacked a rally. VIRTUAL tracked the pace three wide and was in between rivals at the mile fraction and
weakened on the far turn. SISTER SOLA set the pace while unchallenged and was headed leaving the quarter pole and gave way in the drive. REDFIRE
had an outside pursuit before tiring.

Footnotes
CHELLS GIRL stalked the leader from the two path around the first, effortlessly took control leaving the half mile marker, in search of a challenger around
the far turn, stayed well clear under a steady drive. LUCKY IN LOVE stumbled at the start, checked hard nearing the five eighths pole, regrouped around the
far turn, and rallied in deep stretch for the place. LADY GABRIELLE took the lead along the inside around the first turn, under a sung hold gave way to
outside rival down the backstretch, had no response through the stretch. LADIDA chased the pace around the first turn and down the backside, under a
drive and four wide leaving the three eighths marker, came up empty through the stretch. WOKE UP A DIVA was slow away from the gate, and never
threatened.
