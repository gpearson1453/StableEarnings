Footnotes
NINE FOOLS unseated the rider during the post parade and ran loose prior to the start, away from the gate a step slow, was allowed to settle while not far
back in the early running, tracked two wide into the turn, slipped to the rail into upper stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, rallied nicely past
mid-stretch, took command into the final sixteenth and kicked clear in the late stages for a convincing debut win. CLASSY DOE was forwardly placed
leaving the start, took back and tracked the decent early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn, advanced at the quarter marker and was well
positioned nearing the top of the stretch, shifted two wide into the lane and continued her bid at the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner
into the final sixteenth and outfinished SURF STAR to secure place honors. SURF STAR away in good order, vied for the early lead then assumed
command and set a decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, set the pace while off of the rail entering the turn, was pressed to the quarter marker then
shook free into upper stretch, dug in and maintained a clear lead at the furlong marker, was overtaken into the final sixteenth and just held for third at the
wire. SPICY ROSSO tracked the decent early pace from the outside, advanced into the turn and chased the leaders three wide approaching the quarter
marker, shifted five wide for the stretch drive and ran evenly to the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth, was outkicked in deep stretch and
just missed for third. RUMPUS A. P. was forwardly placed in the early running, chased the decent pace from between rivals, ran in pursuit two wide and
between runners into the turn, shifted four wide for the drive, was outkicked at mid-stretch and did not offer a late response. CARE FOR AUTISM hustled to
be prominent in the early running, contested the early pace outside of SURF STAR, pressed that rival through moderate fractions into the turn, lost position
into the stretch and faded in the final furlong. DAME PRANCEALOT bobbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, was allowed to settle in the early
running, saved ground into the turn and did not factor in the stretch drive. WINSOME LOVE paused at the start and broke slowly, lacked early speed and
trailed heading to the half-mile, raced two wide into the turn and failed to threaten in the late stages. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed
using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
GRAZEN SUN settled in the rear of the field through he early going though not far off the pace, kept to the inside through the turn, brushed off some light
contact with MAJOR TOM going into the turn, then tipped out to the four path for clear run, produced a strong rally down the stretch and proved best despite
racing on the left lead. MR. T'S THIRSTY broke well and pressed the pace just to the outside of THUNDER OF ZION to the turn then bid for the lead with
three furlongs to run with ZIPPY BABY also challenging to the outside, let that rival get the jump turning for home then gradually cut into the margin down
the stretch, got the better of the rival past the furlong pole but was no match for the winner in the final yards. MAJOR TOM under a drive from the start,
raced up close to the pace four wide to the half mile marker, lugged in through the turn and exchanged a couple of light bumps with GRAZEN SUN near the
three furlong pole, was kept to task still under steady handling with intermittent urging down the stretch and gained third. ZIPPY BABY broke best but
conceded the lead while stalking the pace in the three path, went to challenge for the lead passing the three furlong marker, took a short lead at the top of
the stretch, was overtaken by the winner at the furlong pole and weakened in the late stages. THUNDER OF ZION brushed with MR. T'S THIRSTY just after
the break then was hustled for forward position, gained the lead at the five-and-a-half marker with MR.T'S THIRSTY and ZIPPY BABY in close attendance,
held on through the turn then gave way passing the quarter pole and was not a factor from that point.

Footnotes
AUTISM INSPIRATION rated nicely off of the decent early pace, tracked from the outside heading to the half-mile marker, loomed three to four wide into the
turn, vied for the lead into upper stretch and took command heading to the furlong pole, drew clear under mild urging into the final sixteenth and pulled away
in deep stretch for a solid debut win. GRACIE'S BIG DAY away in good order, vied for the early lead, ceded to NEPHELE and stalked outside of that runner
heading to the half-mile marker, went up and pressed NEPHELE into the turn, vied for the lead between rivals into upper stretch, was a bit green into the
lane and lost ground to AUTISM INSPIRATION at mid-stretch, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and was a clear second best.
NEPHELE broke alertly, assumed early command and set a decent pace while pressured approaching the half-mile marker, showed the way into the turn
and set the pace while a bit off of the rail nearing the quarter pole, was overtaken into upper stretch and chased the leading pair heading to the furlong
marker, faded in the drive and just held for third at the finish. BIG SOIREE was off a step slowly then was shuffled at the start, trailed in the early stages,
was guided three wide into the turn and trailed approaching the quarter pole, swung to the five path into upper stretch, lacked the needed response into the
final sixteenth and just missed for third. SHIPPING LANE away a bit slowly from the gate, settled off of the decent early pace while not far back, raced two
wide into the turn and gained ground at the quarter pole, lost position into the stretch and could not muster the needed late response. A CLEAR BEHEST
tracked the decent early pace from between runners, was well placed approaching the turn, chased two wide heading to the quarter pole, was outrun into
the stretch and gave way in the final stages. CHOKECHERY SHARI settled off of the decent early pace while not far back, raced two wide into the turn, was
hard to place and got caught in tight while between runners into the stretch, lacked a response into the final furlong and did not factor. CHATTY
LEROYBROWN prominent away from the start, contested the decent early pace inside of NEPHELE, was drifting out approaching the turn and checked in
tight quarters nearing the three-eighths pole, was shuffled back along the turn, chased from the inside into upper stretch, could not keep pace into the
stretch and tired in the late stages. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
LEADING THE PACE broke well and was involved in the early pace from the start, steadied slightly at the three-furlong marker and lost some ground, then
came back under a drive, took command passing the three-sixteenths pole, went clear and was never threatened. DRIVE BY raced extremely wide down
the backstretch but was close to the pace, continued wide through the turn while moving up to challenge the leaders, came into the stretch still in the five to
six path, had the rider lose the crop near the furlong pole but finished well in the middle of the track to win the race for second. FORD FLYER lacked speed,
raced wide down the backstretch and was last going into the turn but not too far off the pace, was set down from the three furlong marker, made some mild
improvement though the turn, kept on under steady handling down the stretch and gained third in the final yards. DANZ TILL TEN lacked early speed from
the break but tracked from a few lengths off the leaders, dropped back to last on the turn but kept to task and finished evenly. BESKAR settled off the pace
while saving ground, went into a drive before the three furlong pole, stayed inside for a bid up the rail, loomed to mid-stretch but could not sustain the run.
BIG STICK broke well and vied for the lead through the early stages, dropped off the pace before the turn, re-bid passing the three furlong pole, loomed four
wide then faltered at the top of the stretch. LAST BABY broke well and let the field to the turn while being hounded by LEADING THE PACE to the inside
and DRIVE BY to the outside, gave way near the quarter pole and had little offer in the stretch.

RIDIN'THESTORMOUT broke alertly, was sent to establish the early lead and dictated terms heading to the half-mile marker, was well handled into the turn
and extended the lead approaching the quarter pole, was set down into upper stretch and kicked clear at the furlong marker, drew away into the final
sixteenth and was ridden out in deep stretch to prevail as much the best. IT IS WRITTEN broke a step slowly leaving the start, recovered and settled off of
the moderate early pace, raced off of the rail entering the turn, shifted three wide nearing the top of the lane and improved position at mid-stretch, angled
widest leaving the furlong marker and rallied into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner into deep stretch and outfinished the rest to secure the
place honors. COIFFEUR squeezed at the start, was off slowly and trailed in the early running, saved ground into the turn and trailed at the quarter pole,
maintained an inside path into the stretch and advanced at the furlong pole, closed willingly into the final sixteenth and got up for third in the final strides.
LIGHTS OF LONDON hustled leaving the start, stalked the early pace from the inside, was well placed approaching the turn and chased
RIDIN'THESTORMOUT nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked at mid-stretch, faded in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for third in deep stretch.
ARA a bit reluctant to load prior to the start, was forwardly placed away from the start, stalked outside of RIDIN'THESTORMOUT heading to the half-mile
marker, chased the pacesetter three wide into the turn, was outkicked at mid-stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth. JEANNER prominent away from
the start, tracked the moderate early pace from the second flight, was well placed into the turn and gained ground while three to four wide approaching the
quarter marker, ran evenly while in pursuit heading to the furlong grounds, could not offer a final response and weakened in deep stretch. TOBACCO
HONEY allowed to settle in the early running, raced outside of runners approaching the half-mile marker, was widest into the turn and went five to six wide
nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and did not factor in the late stages. TRIPLE SLIPPER rushed up and tracked the moderate
early pace from between rivals, raced four to five wide along the turn and lost ground approaching the quarter pole, was outrun into the stretch and faltered
in the drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
HERECOMEGEORGIEBOY was allowed to settle from the break and raced mid-pack for the first half-mile, moved forward and into contention heading in
the far turn, waited briefly near the quarter pole then took advantage of a big hole along the rail, seized command at the head of the stretch went clear and
held easily to the finish under intermittent urging. GALLANT WARREN got squeezed a bit at the start and was last through the first turn, bided time near the
rear of the field down the backstretch then advanced into the far turn, became boxed in from the three furlong pole, got room to run at the top of the stretch
and put in a good finish under steady handling and intermittent urging to gain the place. COUNT ASHER broke outward at the start causing a mild chain
reaction to the outside without being directly affected, settled mid-pack behind the pace duel and to the outside of HERECOMEGEORGIEBOY, took the
three to four path through the far turn while attempting to launch a rally, came five wide into the stretch, made light contact with DUPLICATION in
mid-stretch then continued to run on and was just up for third. JERRY JEFF WALKER broke well got good position through the first turn then dueled outside
of LYING GHOST to the far turn, bested that foe approaching the five-sixteenths marker, remained in contention to the top of the stretch but tired from
earlier efforts and could not sustain a bid. WALKING BOSS broke outward at the start and made light contact with GALLANT WARREN, then went three
wide into the first turn while racing near the back of the pack, stayed that path through the far turn, started to run on from the five-sixteenths pole, came
seven wide into the stretch, finished with some interest but was unable to make an impact. WILD WAGER lacked speed from the break and settled near the
rear of the field well off the pace, kept to the inside while advancing into contention on the far turn, was blocked then swung three wide for the stretch run,
was set down but lacked a response and was outrun to the finish. DUPLICATION was hustled from the break and won the race to the first turn, backed out
of the developing speed duel before the six furlong pole, tracked that pair down the backstretch then moved to engage for the lead near the three furlong
marker, loomed a threat turning for home, took a bump from COUNT ASHER, steadied behind JERRY JEFF WALKER, lost momentum and could not
recover. LYING GHOST was intent on getting to the front then dueled with DUPLICATION to the far turn, hung in there to the five-sixteenths, then tired and
had nothing left for the stretch run. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
LADY GREGORY broke inwards at the start and bothered neighboring rivals, was forwardly placed in the early running and stalked the pace between
runners heading to the half-mile marker, advanced into the turn and pressed the pace two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, chased SMILING
MOLLY into the stretch and closed into the final furlong, wore down the game runner-up in the final sixteenth and held in a drive for a determined win.
SMILING MOLLY hustled away from the gate, assumed early command and set a quick pace heading to the half-mile marker, set contested fractions into
the turn, shook free into upper stretch and was set down for the drive, dug in while leading into the final sixteenth, gamely resisted the oncoming winner in
deep stretch but was bested in the final strides and held for second at the finish. LUSMA prominent away from the start, rated off of the solid early pace and
tracked from the inside heading to the half-mile marker, saved ground into the turn and advanced at the quarter pole, drifted out into upper stretch and
bothered a rival at the three-sixteenths, improved position at the furlong marker, was gaining into the final sixteenth and held well for third in deep stretch.
QUEEN MOLOTOV was bumped leaving the start and was away slowly, tracked the solid early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn then
steadied while caught a bit in tight at the three-eighths pole, advanced nearing the quarter marker and maintained an inside path into the stretch, rallied into
the final sixteenth but could not reel in the leaders in deep stretch. GADDING broke a step slowly leaving the start and was allowed to settle in the early
stages, guided two wide into the turn, maintained that two wide path into the stretch and advanced at the furlong pole, closed willingly into the final sixteenth
but could not muster the needed late response in deep stretch. MADEIRA WINE raced close up to the solid early pace, stalked SMILING MOLLY three deep
approaching the half-mile marker, chased three wide into the turn and lost position at the quarter pole, checked and was carried out by LUSMA into upper
stretch, was outkicked at the furlong marker and weakened in the late stages. SWIFT NONNI forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the solid early pace
from the outside heading to the half-mile marker, chased three then four wide into the turn, altered course in upper stretch, lost ground at the furlong pole
and could not muster a final response. ELEGANT SWAY was squeezed leaving the break and was away slowly, lacked early speed and trailed to the
half-mile marker, saved ground into the turn and trailed to the quarter pole, offered a mild late response but did not factor in the stretch drive. SONOMA
DREAMING took back off of the solid early pace, tracked outside of an inner rival heading to the half-mile marker, was outrun along the turn, stopped in
upper stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off under her own power. THE RIDER OF MADEIRA WINE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER
OF LUSMA FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH. THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED THAT OBJECTION AND RULED NO CHANGE WOULD BE
MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
