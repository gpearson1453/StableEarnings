FITZY lacked early speed, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a wide rally, drove clear and finished strong. GOLD PLUS dueled on the front
end, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear at the head of the home stretch, but proved no match late for the winner. TALKABOUT raced near the back in
the early going, entered the home stretch wide, showed late interest, but was no match for the top two. GOOD BY FAITH raced near the back in the
beginning, saved ground around the turn, angled out, passed tired ones, while finishing wide. R T'S CAJUN LADY dueled for the early lead, saved ground
and faded. JILLY'S WEST challenged for the early advantage and dropped back.

the outside, was outfinished by the top two, but proved best of others. GUMBALL lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn, showed late interest,
but was no factor. JUSASTEELEDREAMER raced in the middle of the field, finished wide and put forth an even effort. IMPRESSIVE BIDDER lacked early
speed, came around the turn wide, moved up, but was no factor. FLASHIN CHIP dueled on the front end, saved ground around the turn and faded.

MATZOH BALL broke in, quickly went to the front, saved ground, took command down the lane and finished well. YAKETY YAK lacked early speed, came
around the turn on the outside, made a wide rally, close well and got up for second. REGINALD AURELIUS pressed the pace, raced outside around the
turn, made a bid down the stretch and was outfinished for second. CAJUN CYCLONE was an early factor, racing within contention, was close throughout
and weakened late. WESTERN AFLEET showed early speed and made a steady retreat. COUNT ON RAIN void of early speed, finished wide and showed
little. BILLY BOWLEGS lacked early speed and was never a threat.

BAYOU BERTIE sprinted to the front, pulled away and proved much the best. TENSAS LUCY raced in the middle of the pack, made a late bid, proved no
match for the winner, but was a clear second. MADELYN'S HIT pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the top two, but held on
for third. NODAH was fractious in the gates, trailed in the early going, moved up on the inside and was outfinished for third. MOION raced evenly near the
back and was never a factor. ASPEN LINK void of early speed, came around the turn wide and was never a threat. ARMY DAY pressed the early pace and
made a steady retreat.

around the turn, made a late gain and finished willingly. B W P SPIRIT raced near the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a late kick.
RARE STRIPE pressed the early pace, faded and finished evenly near the back. UNFATHOMED always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
WHATTA LIFE raced within striking distance, came around the turn four wide, dueled down the lane and prevailed for the win. LOST MY BAG pressed the
pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled to the wire and was outfinished for the win. DADDY'S FINEST raced within contention, came around the turn five
wide and proved no match for the top two late. ROMANCING MS JUDY sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground and tired. INGLIS pressed the early
pace, faded and was no threat late. A BRAVE RIDE void of early speed, trailed the field and was outrun.
