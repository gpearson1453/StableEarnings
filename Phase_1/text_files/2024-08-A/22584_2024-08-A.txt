Footnotes
JERSEY LILLIE broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, battled for the lead from the inside of ROSE OF TEXAS in the
run down the backside, assumed command entering the final turn, and widened over the final furlong under confident handling. ROSE OF TEXAS away well
and chased the pace one out from the rail entering the backstretch, forced the issue from the outside of JERSEY LILLIE in the run down the backstretch,
struggled to keep tabs on her pace rival entering the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. DRILL BABY DRILL
away alertly and tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed two out from the
rail in the drive to hold on for a share. TEXAS LEGACY settled at the back of the pack while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied
three wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest five wide in the drive. PERFECT PENNY stalked the contested early pace while racing one
out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response
when called upon late.

YOU DON'T OWN ME away alertly and raced to a clear advantage in the run to the first turn while saving ground along the inside, controlled the pace
through the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail, continued to lead the way in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and
was all out to hold off SELF SERVING in deep stretch to prevail. SELF SERVING was tossing his head prior to the start, and got away poorly, moved up
three wide through the first turn to assume a tracking trip into the lane the first time, maintained his tracking trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied three
wide through the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to just miss after his early issues. SLEW'S DA BOSS stalked the early
pacesetter while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to save ground in the run down the backside and through the final
turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. BARNEY GOOGLE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, bided his time at the
back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while unable to
mount a serious late bid. VALUE MAX settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his
position in the run down the backstretch, saved ground through the final turn, but failed to make a late impact when called upon.

ACCORDINGLY broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail through the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of NU SOUP
FOR BABY in the run down the backside and into the final turn, took control through the turn, and was never seriously threatened late. RICK'S DANCER
settled off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, began to advanced midway down the backstretch, rallied
smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, shifted off the rail entering the lane, and closed willingly one out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly
second best. NU SOUP FOR BABY dueled for the lead two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to force the pace from the outside of

turn, and finished three wide in the drive to hold on for a share. BARBERRY BANDIT away alertly and tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time
while saving ground at the rail, was unable to maintain his position in the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished evenly

time near the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive while unable
to improve his position. EH TEE EM unhurried early while dropping back to trail in the run to the first turn, was always well back and wasn't persevered with

Footnotes
BRIAN'S DE LEIGHT broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, angled four wide midway down the
backside, rallied three out from the rail through the final turn, and closed determinedly from the outside of CHICKASAW in deep stretch to be up in time.
CHICKASAW was slow into stride, but advanced from just off the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, while awaiting
room, shifted four wide to split rivals entering the lane, and closed willingly to just miss. QUATRE BAK rushed up from along the rail to vie for the early lead
entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of WHEN IN MEXICO in the run down the backside, rallied smartly from along the rail entering
the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late in a solid effort. STANFORD NORTH away well and tracked the dueling leaders three wide entering the
backside, forced the issue three wide entering the final turn, and closed three wide from between rivals in the drive, but was outfinished late. WHEN IN
MEXICO dueled for the lead from the outside of QUATRE BAK entering the first turn, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backside
and from between rivals through the final turn, but was outfinished late. GROOVIN' IS BAK trailed the field into the backstretch while racing two out from the
rail, clipped heels and stumbled midway down the backstretch, saved ground while launching his bid entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact
while finishing along the inside in the drive. Following the running of this race there were both stewards and jockey's inquiries. The rider of GROOVIN' IS
BAK lodged a claim of foul against the rider of BRIAN'S DE LEIGHT for alleged interference midway down the backstretch. After review the rider's claim of
foul was upheld, and BRIAN'S DE LEIGHT was disqualified from first and placed sixth.

Footnotes
DAPHNE away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of HOAX entering the first turn, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, took control shortly after entering the turn, and was never seriously threatened in the late stages. WIRLY GIRLY broke
sharply and stalked the leaders in the run down the backside while saving ground at the rail, commenced her bid from along the inside entering the final
turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to hold the place. ABOVE AVERAGE settled towards the rear of the field while saving ground at the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside through the final turn, shifted off the rail entering the lane, and closed with late interest two
wide in the drive to garner a share. SOLARITY away well and was allowed to settle off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run
down the backside, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly four wide in the drive. CLASS CODE settled at the back of the
pack while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished with some late interest one
out from the rail in the drive. HOAX rushed up from along the rail to vie for the early lead, set a pressured pace from the inside of DAPHNE in the run down
the backside and into the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on her pace rival through the turn, and faded in the late stages. MISS UNION settled off the
contested early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious
late bid when called upon. TAMARA MINE stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, dropped back in the run to the
final turn, and had little to offer late.

MISS ACCELERATE tracked the leader one out from the rail through the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and through
the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to prevail in the final strides. BLUEBIRD CAFE away alertly and raced to the lead from along
the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of MISS ACCELERATE in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and
continued to battle with her pace rival through the lane, and just failed to last. MINI MARKET stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out

sharply and tracked the leaders while saving ground at the rail entering the backside, continued to save ground at the rail entering the final turn, but was

TONIGHT was fractious prior to the start, and trailed the field into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, was always well back and never a
factor. FOREVER SUMMER was fractious prior to the start, and hopped in the air to get away poorly, was always well back and failed to make an impact.
