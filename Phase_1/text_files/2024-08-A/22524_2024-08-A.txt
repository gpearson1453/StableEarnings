Footnotes
QUIETSIDE coaxed from the gate, vied briefly between foes before easing off to chase three then two wide in close aim, coaxed under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and rallied to seize command with three-sixteenths to go, then drew clear to the finish to prevail. FIRST
CLASS LADY got away to an awkward beginning when smally lunging before bobbling awkwardly, vied from the two path briefly with a pair of rivals before
emerging with sole command, tucked inside into the turn and came under pressure from IVORY AND EBONY and dueled with that rival through the turn
coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch under new threat to the outside, got collared with three-sixteenths
to run and kept on under a drive to the finish to preserve the place honors. LIMES DON'T LIE broke in at the start and was briefly inside before tipping to the
two path as LADY PIPPA took over the rail in front, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper
stretch and kept on to the finish well clear of the rest for the show honors. IVORY AND EBONY broke out at the start and bobbled, vied early on from the
four path outside a pair of rivals before briefly prompting the leader tucked three wide, advanced tucked to the two path into the turn and dueled with FIRST
CLASS LADY to her inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away and
weakened. TIPTOP bobbled at the break, chased four then three wide until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
continued in the inside route at the quarter pole and improved position in the stretch. AMOURETTE broke a half a length slow, chased three wide and strode
greenly while also facing kickback, tucked briefly to the two path and then inside into the turn, came under coaxing just off the inside at the seven-sixteenths,
continued in the two path into upper stretch and tired. LADY PIPPA coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out,
swung three wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
NEXT stalked the pace on the outside in the three path while traveling comfortably, took the advantage with about four and one-half furlongs to run, was
challenged by the runner-up who was under a drive into the final turn, shook off that foe with the greatest of ease nearing the five-sixteenths pole then
moved away under his own power, extended the advantage into upper stretch and widened without being asked to win easily. MASQUEPARADE dropped
to the rear, raced in the two to three path on the first turn, settled at the rear while off the inside, was urged along with five furlongs to run, gained to make a
bid under strong urging leaving the backstretch, was turned away by the winner while under the crop near the five-sixteenths pole and proved no match
while far clear for the place. SLIP MAHONEY moved up along the rail late on the first turn then took the advantage, showed the way on the inside, lost the
lead to the winner near the nine-sixteenths pole and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off. TIME FOR TROUBLE went to the front, showed
the way in the two path on the first turn, was pulled out of the race late on that bend and walked off.

Footnotes
BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES just off the inside through the first turn and into the backstretch, tipped three then four wide down the backstretch before tucking
three then two wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and got circled by COLLOQUY in
tandem with the leader straightened away, dug in under a drive and came on through the final sixteenth when that rival grew leg weary, got herded out by
COLLOQUY in a desperation move by the rider but was up in the final jumps to prevail regardless. COLLOQUY tossed his head mildly and leapt up at the
start getting released by his assistant starter after his rivals and conceded four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside
detached at the tail of the field came under coaxing past the three-eighths and tipped three wide at the five-sixteenths, angled out five to six wide into upper
stretch circling the field to take command straightened away and came inwards to the two path edging clear to the eighth pole, dug in growing leg weary
when spent and came under quick threat to the outside, dug in, the rider peering outwards and herded his main danger in desperation late but was nailed in
the final strides. KAHALA chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and raced on one paced
through to the finish. TAKE THE CHARGE three then two wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide down the backstretch before tucking to the
two path into the far turn, took command with seven-sixteenths to go and tucked to the inside midway on the turn placed to coaxing, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and was displaced from the front straightened away, then weakened through to the finish. GUN MAESTRO coaxed from the gate, showed
the way in hand along the inside, got displaced with seven-sixteenths to go and wandered out two to three wide while under coaxing, angled four wide into
upper stretch and folded. LIFE AND LIGHT coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide and then tipped four wide through the far turn under light
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and faltered in the drive and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
KICK A BUCK moved in early, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, waited some behind SUGAR HOOK while under intermittent urging on the
far turn, was roused late on that bend, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then powered away under
strong urging. JOHN THE BAPTIST was hustled from the gate, went around the first turn in the two path, settled while well placed in second position, moved
closer to the leader late on the backstretch, was given his cue in the two path on the far turn, took the lead under a drive in upper stretch, led into the final
furlong then was overtaken by the winner and proved no match while able to hold the place. SUGAR HOOK settled on the inside, was asked on the far turn,
moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, was driven three wide into the stretch, chased the leader under a drive into the final sixteenth and also
proved no match for the winner then just missed the place while able to get the show. BOLT D'PLATA moved in early, traveled around the first turn in the
two path, was reserved near the middle of the field, came under urging in the two then three path on the far turn, turned four wide into the stretch, pursued
the leader into the final sixteenth and missed the trifecta. IL SICILIANO became rank along the rail early then was taken up, came out and bumped with a
foe into the first turn, dropped from the three path to the two path on that bend, settled off the pace, saved ground while roused on the far turn, moved out in
the final furlong, remained on his inside lead until inside the sixteenth-pole then bobbled some while swapping to the proper lead and improved position.
COUNTER ATTACK sped to the front then opened up a sizable advantage in the two path, saw the lead diminish late on the backstretch, was asked while
inside on the far turn, lost the advantage to the runner-up in upper stretch and gave way. FLICKER (GB) saved ground at the rear of the field, was urged on
the far turn, came off the rail into upper stretch and was no factor. VINCITA was taken in hand between horses down the opening straightway then bumped
by a foe into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled on the outside, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, came between horses
outside the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch, remained on his left lead until the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and failed to
respond. BAD BOY BUTCH rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path on
the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. GHOST PRINCE went three to four wide on the turns, came five wide into the stretch and
showed little. MIGHTY GLORY went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, dropped back three wide
under urging on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated.

off the pace between horses, came under encouragement in the two path on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, remained on her inside lead in the drive
and tired. ARANCIATA broke inward then was hustled, showed no speed, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the four
path, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole and was no factor. CLASSICALS FINALE was urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
MAY DAY READY just off the inside through the first turn, settled two to three wide near the rear of the field, tipped out to be four to five paths off the rail
and in the clear with seven-sixteenths to go and advanced quickly tucking three wide into the far turn and then to the two path just inside the three-eighths
which in turn put ALL NIGHT REVIVAL to the rail and in turn forced MAGENTA and QUOIN to check and steady in behind, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths now just in behind the top pair and swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole and shied in when
doing so under a right handed crop, edged away briefly before coming under growing threat to the outside and dug in game to prevail by a nostril on the
wire. LOVE TEMPO (IRE) settled along the inside through the first turn before tipping out three wide down the backstretch in mid pack, tucked to the two
path nearing the three-eighths when placed to coaxing, angled out four wide into upper stretch, closed well through the final furlong to issue a challenge for
it all and just missed on the line. ALL NIGHT REVIVAL tracked the pace along the inside through the first turn and then two to three wide down the
backstretch, was just off the inside into the far turn when the eventual winner advanced outside and tucked in to the outside and in turn tucked to the rail
forcing MAGENTA and QUOIN to check and steady in behind, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and kept
on under a drive to secure the show honors. MAGENTA tracked the front from just off the inside from just off the pace, tucked inside with seven-sixteenths
to go, got forced to check inside the three-eighths marker when ALL NIGHT REVIVAL tucked to the inside due to pressure from MAY DAY READY and in
turn forced QUOIN to steady off her heels in behind her and lost two lengths of ground, came under coaxing and spun just off the inside into upper stretch
and showed good courage to improve her position to the finish. PEDIATRIC PRINCESS showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got let out taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just outside the eighth
pole, weakened in the late stages. BALLERINA D'ORO struck the near side stall at the start getting away last and conceding five to six lengths to the front,
chased along the inside and then just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the
finish. SHE'S A SWEDE just off the inside through the first turn, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and weakened. QUOIN saved ground near the rear of the field, got forced to steady off the heels of MAGENTA near the
five-sixteenths when that foe had to check in front due to pressure from ALL NIGHT REVIVAL and MAY DAY READY tucking in a path, came under coaxing
at that juncture and took the inside route into upper stretch and then weakened in the drive. CHANTICO just off the inside through the first turn, chased five
then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. LADY RIVER LILY coaxed from the gate, raced
forwardly placed three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch
and tired. There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of MAGENTA alleging interference against ALL NIGHT REVIVAL on the far turn. After review, the
objection was dismissed the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
CLEAR THE AIR stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid late on the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole,
took a short advantage while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead after being prompted by the rider with a tug of the
left-rein outside the sixteenth-pole, disposed of the pacesetter into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. BILLAL settled on the inside of a foe
then raced outside starting outside the half-mile pole, was asked in the four path on the turn, chased outside under a drive in the stretch and willingly earned
the place. TOP GUNNER settled off the pace then was taken in hand near the nine-sixteenths, drafted in the two path on the turn, was roused three wide
into the stretch then moved further out, pursued the leader while inside of the runner-up in the drive and just missed the place while able to get the show.
IMPLEMENTATION settled on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch then moved in, went three wide on the turn, was roused five wide into
upper stretch and improved position. MARKET STREET was restless in the gate, showed speed on the inside of a foe then was eased back just off the
pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused late on that bend, pursued the leader in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. CHATTALOT angled in while
sent hard to the front then showed the way, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage while remaining on his
inside lead in upper stretch, battled with the winner until near the sixteenth-pole then dropped back while still on his inside lead and tired. CAPE
TRAFALGAR dropped back under urging, went around the turn in the two path, altered to the inside behind a foe outside the furlong marker, was crowded
along the rail late and failed to threaten. CELESTIAL GLAZE lacked early speed then was urged along at the rear, moved from the rail to the three path late
on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
NOSTALGIC ONE bumped solidly with a foe at the start, went three then two wide on the first turn, was unhurried towards the back, went two then three
wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved out, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed with a rush to get up in the final stride and
prevail. MODICA raced in the three path on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging in the three path on the far turn, moved out in upper
stretch, rallied to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, led narrowly three different times while bobbing heads with ST. JOE LOUIS late and got the best of
that foe but was denied by the winner at the finish. ST. JOE LOUIS (GB) moved in early, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was rated off the
pace, ranged up three wide on the far turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths pole, was asked near the quarter-pole, took the lead into upper stretch, led
under a drive into the final sixteenth, bobbed heads with the runner-up approaching the finish and was denied while able to get the show. NOBLE
HUNTSMAN bumped with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved from the three path to the five path on the far
turn and improved position. NOW AND LATER was hustled from the gate, saved ground on the first turn, settled near the middle of the field, was roused in
the two path on the far turn, moved out some under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. KING FREUD raced in the three path on the first turn,
stalked the pace on the outside, was asked near the seven-sixteenths, made a bid under urging on the far turn, dropped back under a drive into the final
furlong and was outfinished. OFFICER DERICK was hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked under threat on the far turn, lost the
advantage into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and gave way. SKELLIG ISLAND was hustled from the gate, saved ground while well
placed in third position, was roused on the far turn, chased under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. BEARY FUNNY went two then
three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the far turn, dropped back between horses in upper stretch and came up empty. A
LISTER was taken in hand early then eager off heels into the first turn, moved from the two path to the four path on that bend, settled on the outside,
dropped back while moving from the five path to the three path on the far turn and faltered.
