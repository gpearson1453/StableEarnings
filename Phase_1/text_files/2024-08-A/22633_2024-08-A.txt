Footnotes
RESPUNZEL pressed the pace in the three path, was coaxed along around the turn, swung from the four path into the lane, and stayed on to inch past an
inner duo late. BIG BOY JAK set the pace in the two path, was roused from just off the rail midway around the turn, kicked on form the two path into the
stretch, but was caught late by an outer foe to place. VENEZUELA IS GOLD chased inside, was ridden along the rail around the turn, bid up the rail while in
tight around the sixteenth, but hung late for show. VENEZUELAN HOPE raced off the pace in the three path, angled out to the five path passing the eighth
pole, and kept on but made no impact. MY SERGEANT prompted the pace in the four path, floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, and flattened.
ADIOS BUSTER dwelt in the gate, was wellback in the four path early and never factored. MEGA DON trailed in the two path and never threatened.
MAKOA rated inside but never menaced.

Footnotes
SPETTRO set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane, drifted out under left-handed urging and dug in gamely. SILENT AND
VIOLENT settled off the pace while racing four wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, bid outside of the winner in upper stretch but was held at bay.
BANDERO had his head turned at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled four wide in upper stretch and rallied for the show. BELLY OF JELLY stalked
the winner from the rail around the first turn, angled out down the backstretch, prompted in the three path around the far turn and was outkicked in the lane.
FLATTER ME raced off the pace three wide, angled further out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. CAPTAIN ANTHONY saved ground off pace,
went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. SHAKE YOUR BONES chased the pace two wide around the first turn and from the rail around the
far turn and faded through the lane. EUPHORIA STAR raced off the pace inside, steadied near the half-mile pole and was never a threat. A CLAIM OF
FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER OF EUPHORIA STAR AGAINST BANDERO FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
FORGED STEEL prompted the pace in the three path, took command and received a right handed cue in the two path early around the far turn, and kicked
away in the four path down the lane to prove much the best. SUPER SAILOR stalked in the four path, was driven three wide around the far turn, and kept on
for place. COMO chased inside, had to steady going into the far turn, then got stymied from the rail around the far turn, angled out to the three path passing
the eighth pole, and got up for show. MONEYLOVE set the pace in the two path, but lost the lead along the rail midway around the far turn, and faded.
HEGS tracked in the two path, was ridden between foes around the far turn, but flattened from the four path in the stretch. MUSTANG BAY trailed in the two
path, fanned out to the six path under a drive turning into the stretch, but was no factor. ZIO MO had an awkward start, rated in the three path but never
threatened. DEPUTY TRAMON raced off the pace inside, but had to steady early down the backstretch, and never menaced.

Footnotes
FULANITO set a clear pace in the two path, drifted out in the stretch and just lasted. ASHER'S EDGE chased the winner in the two path, tipped into the
three path turning for home, rallied outside, reached even terms late and lost the bob. JUNCTION ROAD veered in and bumped CHEYENNE BRAVE at the
start, made progress five wide around the turn, angled in as the top two drifted out in the stretch and rallied for the show. TRICKY TIGER chased the pace
three wide and lacked the needed rally. KALIMAN failed to menace while racing three wide. MYSTIC LUTE broke slowly, saved ground and never
threatened. CHEYENNE BRAVE was bumped at the start, raced three wide and never reached contention. TIZ RUDDY BEN chased the pace four wide and
came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
KIZZY showed the way along the inside entering the backstretch, inched away under confident handling around the far turn, was roused from the two path
at the top of the lane, and dug in to hold sway. MUSICAL ROMANCE (GB) rated in the three path, was roused in the four path midway around the far turn,
drifted out down the stretch, but ran on for place. JUDGE JUDITH chased in the four path, ranged up under a nudge around the far turn, took aim in the
three path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly for show. IPANEMA PRINCESS (IRE) raced in midpack between foes from the three path, but steadied
in the two path passing the quarter, and flattened. KHOSEA steadied along the rail midway around the first turn, tracked inside, had to check along the rail
passing the quarter, then faded. DUBSTEP trailed in the four path, was driven five wide around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path entering the
stretch, but failed to bid. BOTH SIDES prompted the pace in the three path, steadied between foes in the two path passing the quarter, then weakened.
LUCKY GIRL COCO stalked in the four path but backed up between foes around the far turn.

IT'S ONLY WORDS pressed the pace between foes in the three path, took over in upper stretch and drew clear under a drive. DEFENDED raced off the
contested pace in the two path and kept on to be clearly second best. RED HOT SPARK prompted the pace in the four path, could not match with the
winner nearing the quarter pole but held well enough for the show. AVE FENIX failed to menace while racing three wide. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) was outrun
inside. SUPER SPIN set a pressured pace in the two path and wilted in the lane. GRATIA trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
UNRELENTLESS stalked in the four path, bid under coaxing passing the three-eighths pole, took command while tipping out to the five path turning into the
lane, and drew clear. FOXY LADY chased in the five path, was driven around the turn, and ran on from the six path in the stretch for place. SHE'S OUTTA
HERE rated in the four path, was roused from the three path into the turn, and kept on from the four path down the lane for show. TROTTING GEAR raced
wellback in the three path, merged inside going into the turn, angled back out to the six path at the top of the stretch, but made no impact. DRILL'S
VALENTINE trailed inside, had to steady passing the half, fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but failed to bid. PATTY'S HAVING FUN set
the pace in the three path but yielded in the two path passing the quarter. JUST TAKE NOTES tracked in the three path, bid passing the three-eighths pole,
took the lead midway around the turn, but was quickly overtaken by an outer foe passing the quarter, and gaveway.

Footnotes
ARISAEMA raced well back two wide around the first turn, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed outside, seized command near the sixteenth pole
and drew clear. POSSESSION had early speed inside, angled out down the backstretch, prompted in the three path around the far turn, took the lead
turning for home, lugged in in midstretch, led to the sixteenth pole and held well for the place. GHOSTS LIL SECRET bumped at the start, saved ground off
the pace, steadied near the three-eighths marker, advanced four wide around the far turn, fanned seven wide turning for home and rallied for the show.
DENVER'S ALLEY bumped at the start, set the pace in the two path and weakened through the stretch. BIANKA HEART chased the pace four wide and
faded in the lane. GOULDIAN was outrun inside. FAR ABOVE failed to menace while racing two wide. ETHEL gave chase three wide and faded inside
around the far turn. FIORENZA played no factor while racing four wide. NOBLY bumped at the start, raced four and five wide and was through early.
