Footnotes
HAMMERIN AAMER saved ground through the first turn, shifted two wide down the backstretch while under a firm hold, began to close ground while angling
four wide on the far turn, rallied into the stretch under right handed urging to make the lead near the furlong marker and proved best under strong handling.
MR LAOBAN well placed, loomed boldly three wide into the stretch and finished second best. SWELTER pressed the pace along the rail through the
clubhouse turn, dropped back before a half, swung five wide entering the stretch and came on again late. APACHE passed tiring rivals. SMALL SAILOR
battled for the lead two wide for six furlongs then gave way. MAS ORO dueled for the lead along the inside to the quarter pole then was used up. GEH
SCHNELL had his head turned as the gate opened and missed the break by several lengths then was never involved. SEE SPOT RUN was always outrun.
FIRST CITIZEN vied for the lead three wide for six furlongs then stopped. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

VISUAL MISSION trailed for a half, circled his field on the far turn to make the lead at the top of the stretch then drew off under mild left handed urging to
win as much the best. SPEEDY MOBILE stalked the early pace four wide, split horses two wide to make the lead late on the far turn then was no match for
the winner. SERENDIPITOUS set the pace along the inside through the first turn, dropped back before a half, trailed through the second turn then passed
tiring rivals in the three path in upper stretch. HENRY THE CAT stalked the early pace three wide, went up to made the lead at the half mile marker,
dropped to the rail soon thereafter, set the pace until the quarter pole, drifted to the seven path in upper stretch then weakened. SURROUNDER was
fractious in the gate, prompted the pace two wide through the first turn, gained a narrow lead after a quarter, was headed at the half mile marker, remained
a sharp threat into the far turn then was used up.
