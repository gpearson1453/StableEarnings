INITTOWINIT was well back, closed the gap on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch rallied in time. IMPECCABLE TIMING stalked the
early leader, a factor on the far turn and was second best in a good effort. P T BEAUCETTE was off the pace, had a mild gain on the far turn and from the
four path at the top of the stretch was up for show. AMI'S GIRL tracked the early leader, forced the pace on the far turn and had the lead from the three path
at the top of the stretch but gave way. LUCKY LOUISE set the pace and had the lead on the far turn but had nothing left. FEROCIOUS QUEEN was
unhurried early, chased on the far turn and failed to fire. ROHESE settled off the pace and saved ground on the far turn but was not a factor.

OPEECHEE was up close, a factor on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch just lasted. BEER MOSA was well back, trailed the field on
the turn, angled outside in mid stretch and just missed. FINAL RUN FOR LOVE was hustled early from the inside and raced evenly on the turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch needed more. BEST AND FINAL was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch leveled off. DELIRIO forced the early pace and had a slim lead on the turn but gave way through the stretch. YOU SEE ME was unhurried early and
roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. FRAC CITY showed speed from the outside and dueled on the turn but
dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
GUS'S GAMBLE set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and with mild pressure in deep stretch prevailed. SENSIBLE PORTIONS was in range,
moved up on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. STREET SERENADE settled off the pace, had a mild gain
on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for show. RIVER OF BABYLON was off the pace and moved up on the far turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. JUSTIN'S WAY was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but from the six path at the top
of the stretch had no late kick. THY KINGDOM was well back, trailed the field on the far turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. SAME AGAIN DOC
was unhurried early and roused from the inside on the far turn but had no response. TWO YEAR CONTRACT was in mid pack and hustled along on the far
turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no rally. HARDWARE GAP stalked the early leader but chased on the far turn and dropped back
through the stretch.
