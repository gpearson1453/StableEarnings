set the pace in the two path to midstretch and held well enough for the show. COUNTRY SLEW saved ground off the pace and improved position in the
lane. HONOR THAT DUDE prompted the pace in the three path and weakened in the lane. PREMIADO bumped twice early, raced two and three wide and
never threatened. CENTERFOLD GUY chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. DIOS WILL played no factor while racing two wide.

R MORNING BREW got sent from the gate to set the pace in the two path, came under coaxing along the rail early around the turn, faced an outer
challenger midway around the turn, dug in while tipping just off the rail enter the lane, and drew clear in the final furlong. DON'T FOOL WITH ME stalked in
the four path, was cued to bid two wide midway around the turn, tipped out to the three path turning into the stretch, was repelled by the winning pacesetter
nearing the eighth pole, but held place. MY DENYSSE chased in the six path, was coaxed along in the five path around the turn, and kept on from the six
path down the lane for show. FEDE tracked in the four path, came under a ride in the three path passing the three-eighths pole, and was one paced in the
four path down the stretch. GOSHAKI GOSHAKI was prompted along from up close in the three path, but faded along the inside turning into the stretch.

MOM'S MARTINI chased in the three path, angled out to the five path to take aim at the top of the lane, and rallied past an inner duo in the final sixteenth.
HOPE WITH POPE broke out and bumped an outer foe, stalked in the four path, ranged up to bid under coaxing turning into the stretch, ran on to lead
passing the eighth pole, but was caught by an outer foe in the closing stages to place. GEAUX AMY was hustled in midpack from the two path, lost ground
in the four path around the turn, but kicked on down the lane for show. DEETZ set the pace in the two path, received a right handed cue midway around the
turn, dug in entering the stretch, but yielded in the final sixteenth. FLATTER ME AVERY prompted the pace in the three path but faded along the inside
down the lane. WHIRLAWAR hopped at the start, raced off the pace in the four path, floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but flattened.
MUSTANG BUCKS got bumped by an inner foe at the start, trailed in the six path before merging to the rail going into the turn, but never threatened.
CAMM'S PRINCESS got bumped by an inner foe into an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the six path and never menaced.

Footnotes
R DISASTER had her head turned at the start, set a clear pace in the two wide and widened while ridden out in the lane. CAJUNETTE chased the winner in
the three path, continued on the left lead in the lane and was clearly second best. FIVE EYES ONMICHEL chased the pace inside, lacked the needed rally
but bested the rest. FUSSY GIRL was fractious in the gate, hit the gate, raced two wide and never threatened. MISS BIA failed to menace while racing four
and five wide. TREE C'S KAI raced in midpack in the four path and lacked a closing bid. BASILICA LIGHT trailed inside.

Footnotes
ADMIRAL HOPPER hopped at the start, rated in the three path, ranged up in hand from the four path approaching the quarter, was cued to bid in upper
stretch, and drew clear around the sixteenth. ANATOMY raced off the pace in the two path, got stymied in the three path midway around the turn, fanned
out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and rallied for place. BRASHANKNOWIT set the pace in the three path, but evened out from the two path in the
final furlong to show. DAVID'S ROSE got bumped by an outer foe at the start, stalked in the two path, took aim in the four path at the top of the stretch, but
flattened. PARTY SHAKER pressed the pace inside, cut the corner turning into lane, got in tight around the sixteenth, and faded. BEL ROSSO trailed in the
two path and never threatened. MISTICA TRAVIESA (CHI) broke in and bumped an inner foe, chased in the three path but never menaced.
