Footnotes
SMOOTH JUSTICE veered out at the start, set the pace while racing in hand, drew off on the turn and widened the lead under mild urging. KITTEN ROCKS
was slow early, rallied around the turn, offered a mild bid to earn place and was no match for the winner. JOCELYN was void of early speed, put in a steady
effort in an inside trip and got up late for show. MUSED (GB) pressed the pace to the turn, dropped back, came up empty in the drive and lost position.
LUNARCHY was pushed out at the start, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. ZENCHUA SKY raced mid pack, swung wide leaving the turn and gave
way.

Footnotes
MILLARD'S SMILE was unhurried early, raced outside, rallied around the turn, bid four wide, inched clear past the eighth pole and held off the late surge of
KHOZAN'S SUCCESS to just last. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS pressed the pace while being rated, fell back entering the stretch, altered course past the eighth
pole, surged late and was gaining ground. NOT VERY GENTLE raced close to the pace, saved ground, bid along the rail, was blocked mid stretch, altered
course and got up for show while no threat to the top two. BLURT was sent to the front to set the pace to mid stretch, tired and stopped. UNIFIED
WEEKEND showed speed to the second turn, weakened and gave way.

SIMPLE LOGIC stalked the pace while racing inside, shifted out on the turn, assumed command, drew away for a clear lead and held safely under steady
urging. ALL CHOKED UP was carried out on the first turn, stalked the pace to the second turn, challenged for the lead, fell back, couldn't gain late and
finished second best. BALADINE set a pressured pace to the second turn, weakened, fell back and settled for show. HAY MOON broke out and was
steadied at the start to be off slowly, raced in the back, advanced to the turn, bid willingly, was in tight mid stretch and lacked the needed rally. LAWMAKER
saved ground to the second turn, angled out, was in tight mid stretch and came up empty late. HELIOCHROME was carried out on the first turn, raced mid
pack, was checked hard on the second turn and fell back. BE LUCKY bore out badly on the first turn, moved up into the backstretch to vie two across, tired
on the second turn and stopped. EUCLID AVENUE was carried out on the first turn, bore out badly, was eased and walked off. Hand timed.

Footnotes
LITTLE POISON set the pace, drew off in the drive and was ridden out. NOTIPTONI was pushed in at the start, raced close to the pace along the inside,
awaited room on the turn, got through along the rail and earned place while no match for the winner. SHOW ME THE LIGHT veered in at the start, was void
of early speed, offered a mild bid inside and got up for show while no threat to the top two. BELLA VITTORIA hesitated at the start to be off slowly, rushed
up outside to get within range and stopped. SHE STOPPED SHORT was reluctant to load, impeded at the start, raced in the back, swung wide leaving the
turn and lacked a rally. FAITH HOPE N LOVE broke in, showed speed to the turn, went six wide entering the stretch and gave way. LYLAH RENEE stalked
the pace to the turn and stopped.

FIRST HILL pressed the pace, challenged three across in to the turn, dueled to late stretch, inched clear and was all out at the wire. BEEHIVE raced close
to the pace towards the outside, closed steadily and was gaining late. COMMISSIONER GULCH lagged early while never far back, went widest in the drive,
found her best stride late and was gaining fast. WILMA MANKILLER dueled to the sixteenth pole, was unable to sustain her bid and lost position late.
HYPERSPORT raced close to the pace along the inside, fell back on the turn, angled out for thue drive and finished well. SALLY'S SUPRISE was void of
early speed, saved ground, bid inside and didn't have enough left. FLAMAND vied inside, was taken back on the turn, angled out, angled back in for the
drive, bid and hung.

FLYING SAMURAI set a pressured pace to the second turn, drew clear and extended the lead while kept to task. TWO COOKIE RULE settled off the pace,
rallied around the far turn, was carried out entering the stretch, closed willingly, couldn't gain ground and was no match for the winner. BOURBON DELIGHT
vied two across, fell back on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, continued willingly and came up empty late. WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR was outrun in
an even effort. MISTER CHARMING raced mid pack, saved ground, bid inside leaving the turn and had nothing left for the drive. ZARMAE bumped after the
start, was slow early, advanced to the second turn, went widest in the drive and failed to threaten. KRAMDEN bumped after the start, trailed the field and
showed little.

NAVY SEAL saved ground, advanced to the turn, bid along the rail, assumed command and drew clear. RICHIESONAROLL lagged early while racing
between horses, closed willingly and was gaining late. TWIRLING ROSES stalked the pace, rallied four wide on the turn, was carried out entering the
stretch and finished well. FAITHFUL RULER set the pace to the turn, swung wide and dropped back. ELI'S PROMISE raced outside in an even effort and
failed
to
menace.

Footnotes
MY LADY SLEW broke sharply, was hustled away from the gate, set a pressured pace and held on gamely. R KATIEBUG settled off the pace, advanced
into the turn, closed steadily and was gaining fast late. GET N TIPSY was in tight and steadied into the first turn, raced mid pack, bid off the rail, went
willingly to the wire and was gaining late. GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN raced mid pack, swung wide entering the stretch, found her best stride late and was
gaining ground. CHURCH PEW raced close to the pace, bid inside entering the turn to loom a threat, hung late and lost position. COMMAND POINT was
unhurried early, bid inside leaving the turn and finished well. SECRET OPERATION broke in, was steadied on the first turn, lagged early and lacked the
needed late response. BOLTORO angled in at the start, advanced to the second turn to get within range and failed to rally. ALL ABOUT ME broke out,
pressed the pace to the second turn and leveled off in the drive. VISIONISTA was crowded at the start to be off slowly and trailed the field.
