Footnotes
ORDER OF MAGNITUDE raced off the pace inside, advanced two wide on the far turn, rallied between horses into the stretch, hooked up with COCO
SHELL, battled heads apart with that rival through the final furlong and got the nod at the wire. COCO SHELL eased back off the pace to stalk the leaders,
moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied outside into the stretch, dueled with the winner through the final furlong, dug in gamely and just missed.
BRASSTOWN raced three wide early, then dueled two wide for the lead, took over on the backside, dueled into the stretch, could not stay with the top pair,
then dug in on the rail and finished evenly. AHSAD dueled inside for the lead, chased on the far turn and tired. MODERN MIDAS raced four wide on the first
turn, settled off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and failed to threaten. SENSIBLE JIM raced off the pace between rivals, chased and gave way.
RECKLESS PLACE raced three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace and did not factor.

gamely, edged away past the furlong marker and nailed at the wire. IN MY MEMORIES stalked outside, chased on the turn, rallied between rivals into the
stretch and dug in gamely to the end. CANTAFIO was off a bit slow, steadied between rivals at the half mile marker, continued between horses on the turn,
came four wide into the lane, angled in and rallied mildly. SIMSARA raced five wide early, then chased three wide, rallied outside rivals turning for home, bid
and weakened in the final sixteenth. BUGGED OUT chased close up on the inside, chased on the turn and tired. SELECTIVE ENTRY raced three or four
wide off the pace, chased on the turn and faded. FLORIDA FLOWER was off a bit slow, chased inside and faded. CORRIB QUEEN was outrun. TINY
