HURRICANE ALERT rated close inside, started his bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady handling and
took over later yards. TIME TO CHOOSE took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, was met into the backstretch but recovered the advantage nearing the
three eighths pole, dueled clear toward the quarter, raced at the rail on the far turn but was caught in later yards and relented while flattening stride. CURB
THAT TIGER settled back inside on the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and finished evenly to
close the gap. NEVERFOLD settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, entered the far turn about the five path, was
forced out approaching the head of the lane and showed little more. ON A WHIM stalked the early pace off the rail, took a brief lead into the backstretch but
was overcome toward the three eighths pole and weakened while losing ground on the far turn. PINNACLE REEF settled in the four path the first turn,
picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path on the far turn. MEETMARYSMAN brushed the gate at the break,

Footnotes
MISS PEARL HART took a quick lead and rated the early pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at the rail and was
steadily handled to hold on. GOLD ALLIANCE tapered in and stalked the early pace, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, drifted a bit nearing the
head of the lane but dug in when straightened away and finished well. KLUVYAMEANANDNASTY gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and finished
evenly to close the gap. NO BODY LIKES ME gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little further. RAGAZZA MIA veered in
and exchanged contact with MAKAAN leaving the gate then gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn and weakened in the lane. The latter stumbled
outward and to her nose leaving the gate, exchanged contact with Ragazza Mia and was not a factor. BELLAFLEET broke a step slow and was pinched
back.

EXTRA DIRTY was bumped leaving the gate then stalked from the three path, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, contested even terms two deep on the
far turn, dug in determinedly to take the nod in later yards and inched further ahead toward the wire. DICE ARM veered out leaving the gate then rated a
slim lead inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, was met into the far turn and contested even terms through the turn, dug in
gamely from the head of the lane, but gave up the lead in later yards and just lasted for second. WAC IS FAST broke a step slow then saved ground on the
first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, finished well and just missed second. BATTLE
TESTED veered out and made sharp contact with Extra Dirty leaving the gate then settled inside on the first turn, angled out and made contact with. DEE
DEE SIX past the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, then flattened in the four path on the far turn. The latter settled two deep the first
turn, was bumped and gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the four path on the far turn. I'M FRIESAN stalked two deep, challenged
nearing the three eighths pole but dropped back at the five sixteenths and faded. MADAM LEOTA raced in the four path the opening turn and showed little
response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
CRAFTY CANDYGRAM rated the pace while tapering to the inside, was pressured nearing the quarter pole, rounded the turn at the rail and held well under
steady handling. CRY TOUGH gave chase, raced close off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. AIM'S REDIRECT chased through the
backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail then dug in from the head of the lane and took third under the wire. COUNT THE FLOWERS gave chase inside,
raced at the rail on the turn and was nipped from third under the wire. GHOSTLY ANNA ducked outward and made sharp contact with SHESA BABE
leaving the gate then gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little in the lane. The latter was bumped outward at the break, gave
chase through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. SUGAR CANE JANE gave chase outside then weakened in the
six path on the turn. CITY OF ARCHES came away slowly then bore to the outside and loped around.
