AMERICAN POSSE sped to the lead at the start and held clear around the first turn, set the pace near the inside up the backstretch, turned back bid from
rival at the quarter pole, saved ground entering the lane, widened advantage still in hand, kept clear under confident handling and finished ridden out.
MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE was forwardly placed two wide around the first turn, stalked the leader outside of rival to the far turn, moved up into striking
range at the quarter pole, failed to reach the eventual winner, but sustained a steady bid and cleared second best. GINGER RULES raced up close just off
the inside on the first turn, stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, was ridden along two wide into upper stretch, failed to kick on, weakened off the top
pair and ran along for show.

ROSE PARADE led the way around the first turn, continued on top then came under pressure mid-way up the backstretch, vied for the lead past the half
mile marker, shook free mid-way around the far turn, came two wide into upper stretch, roused for more, responded gamely and drew off. MARSHSIDE
MAMA raced up close around the first turn and stalked up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide near the quarter pole, was no match for the pulling
away winner in the stretch run but ran on and gained second best. RUNNINTHESTREETS raced off the early pace, picked up the tempo late on the far turn,
hustled along two wide into stretch and gained show. FEARLESS KRISTIE raced just off the leader around the first turn, pressed the pace mid-way up the
backstretch then dueled with eventual winner going by the half mile marker, could not match strides past the mid-way point around the far turn, sustained
bid into upper stretch then flattened in the final furlong. CRYSTAL SYMPHONY rated off the top trio, saved ground around the far turn and had no response.
LAVENDER LIL raced in the back throughout.

INSENSITIVE was nicely rated in the opening quarter, picked up the pace around the turn, came four paths wide entering the head of the lane, dug in three
deep a furlong out, edged ahead to the lane and finished clear. ADDABABY took over the lead soon after the start, continued to hold a slim lead around the
turn, cut the corner and set down for the drive, fought back a furlong out then got outfinished by the winner. ZIP CODE ENVY was forwardly placed in the
opening quarter, chased two wide around the turn, dug in racing two wide in striking distance a furlong out then got overtaken by the winner and weakened
to show. FULL SPIRIT rated along the inside in the opening quarter, saved ground around the turn, cut the corner then shifted three wide and needed more
for late impact. AMERICAN COALMINER tracked in contention through early stages, was ridden along two to three wide around the turn, came two paths
into upper stretch then gave way. BARBSDREAMCOMETRUE raced in the back, saved ground then angled out and lacked a needed rally.

LUCKYHOTSTUFF rated off the early leaders, moved up to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, continued in striking distance upper stretch, took a
slim lead a furlong out then drew clear. SAMIRA tracked the early pace along the outside, moved up to engage rivals for the lead at the quarter pole,
continued two wide in striking distance into the stretch, got overtaken by the eventual winner a furlong out, kept on and cleared second best. ANNIEWAY U
WANT IT sped to the lead soon after the start and led the way up the backstretch, took on challengers at the quarter pole, fought back gamely and held the
edge upper stretch, got collared by eventual winner a furlong out and weakened to show. BYE LOVE GOTTA GO was forwardly placed up the backstretch,
continued in contention around the turn, cut the corner and lacked a clear path at the head of the lane, shifted out and lacked the needed response for
impact. I THINK I KNOW YOU raced near the inside off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, angled three to four wide entering upper stretch and
lacked a needed rally. BUG A BOO raced in the back, hustled along four to five wide into upper stretch and never threatened. ATHENAS SONG raced off
the early pace, edged closer three to four wide late on the turn then faded in the lane. GAME TO PLAY raced in contention in the opening quarter,
weakened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.
