Footnotes
PALIO (IRE) stalked the runaway leader from the front of the main body, commenced a rally on the backside the second time around, quickly narrowed the
leader's advantage, took command on the final bend and drew off under wraps a much best winner. PAVONI reserved well off the pace on the inside of the
trailing threesome for the first two miles, rallied leaving the final hurdle, was no match for the winner but was easily second best. ANZIO sped off to a lengthy
commanding lead for the first mile and a half, struggled a bit at the fifth jump, was reeled in by the pack on the backside the final time around and kept-on to
hold the show despite weakening on the final bend. DARK POOL tracked the distant leader from the second flight, ralliedapproaching the seventh hurdle at
the two mile mark and flattened out on the far turn unable to sustain the rally. KENILWORTH KING was unhurried to be between rivals in the trailing group,
was called upon leaving the final jump, had no response and was eased to wire. L'AVVOCATO (FR) fell on the seventh hurdle while traveling at the rear of
the field and walked off.

JIMMY DAN reserved near the rear of the field for the first two mile while travelling well, rallied leaving the final hurdle and wore his rival down on the flat to
prevail late. TWO PAST EIGHT (GB) settled nicely to track the leaders for the first mile, steadily gained ground to sixth jump, quickly took command opening
a wide advantage down the backside the last time, dug-in gamely when engaged turning for home and could not hold the winner off late. MINELLA PLUS
(IRE) set the early pace on a wide lead, maitained the advantage for a mile and a half and steadily gave way in the final three-quarters. BELLARMINE HALL
trailed throughout, stumbled leaving the fifth hurdle and never mounted a bid. EXUMA (IRE) was well placed stalking the pacesetter for a mile and a half and
fell when rallying into the seventh jump and was vanned off.

EXCULPATE raced to a wide advantage in the first half mile, struggled a bit with the third jump, was well rated on the lead in a well handled ride, responded
when briefly challenged on the final turn and pulled away convincigly in the lane while well in hand. CAINUDOTHETWIST reserved off the pace for the first
mile, steadily gained position in the next mile to be well placed leaving the final hurdle and rallied for the place on the flat. HAINT BLUE (FR) tracked the
pacesetter for a mile and a half, rallied on the backside to close the gap, threatened on the final bend and finished evenly unable to sustain the bid. MOLLY
FANTASY (GER) unhurried while racing near the rear of the field for the first two mile and mounted a mild rally passed weakened rivals coming home.
LOVE SAGA trailed most of the way and made a mild bid passing tiring rivals in the final three-quarters. AFRAID NOT stalked the pace for a mile and a half
and steadily faded. GETBACKSHADRACK (IRE) raced mid-pack for the first lap and a half and came up empty.

Footnotes
SACKETT reserved off the pace from five wide down the backstretch, commenced a steady rally on the turn angling in to save ground, angled out to the five
path though the lane and closed well to take command in the final fifty yards. FREDDY BOY dueled from two wide exchanging the lead several times to the
quarter pole, took command drawing clear in mid-stretch and was run down late in the drive in a game effort. GREY SHADOW pressed from the rail on the
pace for a half mile, weakened in upper stretch and kept-on as best of the rest. LUCKY DAY tracked the dueling leaders to be well placed and lacked a
response when called upon midway on the turn. IMPROBABLE ME broke awkwardly to give a couple lengths to the field, was hustled to keep pace down
the backside and went evenly as a non-threat. LISTENING contended briefly and steadily gave way. CAJUN SWAGGER bumped leaving the gate, dropped
to the back of the field several lengths away from the main body early and trailed throughout from there as a non-factor.

Footnotes
RANDAZZO broke a step tardy to be at the rear of the field, pulled to contention down the backside, rallid on the outside under urging on the turn, drifted out
to the six path in upper stretch and closed well to wear his rivals down in the final yards. JOLLY BY GOLLY prompted the pace for a half mile, was put to a
drive nearing the quarter pole, steadily gained ground while grinding in the lane, took a brief lead in deep stretch and was outkicked in the final strides.
NORTHERN CHILL set the pace under mild pressure throughout, responded well digging in down the lane and weakened in the final sixteenth. PATIENT
CAPITAL trailed most of the way and mounted a mild wide rally in the lane without impact. OMNI KING was well placed stalking thep ace from the fence to
the quarter pole, lacked a response when called upon and tired through the stretch.

Footnotes
MUFASA (CHI) pressed the pace while racing wide down the backstretch, angled in to the two path to turn up the pressure on the bend, responded when
called upon turning for home to quickly open a clear advantage under steady urging and was taken in hand late in an impressive performance. REPO
ROCKS set a pressured pace to the top of the lane, dug-in when challenged, was no match for the winner but kept-on willingly to be second best in a good
effort. MURRAY slow early to be well off the pace, rallied at the head of the lane from the four path, angled to the inside in upper stretch and finished with
good energy to be up for the show. LUGAN KNIGHT tracked the leaders from the rail through the turn, tipped out five wide in upper stretch and rallied with a
late surge to just miss the show. BLUE KENTUCKY was unhurried to race near the rear of the field to the top of the lane and showed some late interest to
gain ground late. FREE SOUL broke alertly, was taken in hand to stalk the leaders down the backside, angled in to the rail rurning for home to loom large
and flattened out theough the drive. WHELEN SPRINGS chased the leaders to midway on the turn, had no response when called upon and gave way in the
stretch. FINAL TIME WAS A NEW TRACK RECORD.

Footnotes
INSTPARTY rated two wide down the backstretch from between rivals, rallied four wide on the turn, followed LITA through traffic in the lane, split rivals while
finding best stride late inside the sixteenth pole and surged in the final strides to be up in time in a well handled ride. FONDRE tracked the pace from five
wide through the turn, mounted a rally in the six path down the lane to lead yards from the wire and was just outfinished. MOMENTOUS MISS pressed the
pace from between rivals to the turn, rallied turning for home to take the lead in mid-stretch and was caught late in the drive in a game effort. CALL THE
QUESTION slow away from the gate when brushed by outside rival, remained unhurried for three-eighths, circled nine wide coming home and closed with a
belated late rush to be gaining with every stride in deep stretch. LITA reserved off the pace in hand down the backside while racing in contention, worked
through traffic on the turn and in upper stretch, dove to an opening on the inside in mid-stretch to loom boldly and was outkicked in a good try. DELIZIOSA
stalked the pace in a clear pocket down the backside, ralliedfive wide on the turn to threaten in upper stretch and failed to sustain the bid. BABY BLOCKS
was well placed saving ground on the turn, cut the corner turning for home and rallied mildly in the lane. MOONSHINING trailed to the head of the lane and
passed tiring riivals in the stretch. LUSTY set a pressured pace from three wide to the turn, opened a clear lead on the bend and tired coming home.
LEGEND OF LIGHT raced up the fence to duel on the lead into the turn and came up empty nearing the quarter pole.

BOAT'S A ROCKIN broke alertlyto immediately take command, opened a clear lead while well rated to the head of the stretch, maintained that lead when
called upon to deep stretch and held well late while weakening. B DETERMINED reseerved off the early pace, commenced a rally four wide midway on the
bend under urging, altered course to the inside in upper stretch and was closing well to be gaining late. LUCCI prompted the early pace, settled to a stalking
position, failed to gain oon the pacesetter and kept-on through the lane to hold the show. BOSS IS A PAL settled to a tracking trip on the backstretch, was in
striking distance turning for home and lacked a closing kick while drifting out in the lane. WHERE'S RAY raced near the back of the pack to the quarter pole
and rallied mildly passed weakened rivals in the stretch. BORRACHO well placed along the fence to the rurn and faded. SAN COSTANTINO trailed as a
non-threat throughout.

Footnotes
ALL I WANT IS YOU reserved off the pace to midway on the turn, rallied in upper stretch, angled to the clear midway down the lane and found his best
stride late to be up in the final yards. SOL HOPE tracked the leaders into the turn, idled losing ground on the bend, rallied splitting horses near the quarter
pole to be in the clear four wide, caught the leader inside the eighth pole to take command and was outkicked by the winner in deep stretch.
HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES pressed the pace from four wide through the turn, took command turning for home, dug-in through the lane and was out-finished
late in the drive in a good effort. CHICKAHOMINY rated off the pace to the turn, worked his way though traffic in the lane, angled to the rail and was gaining
along the fence. VISBY slow early to trail and rallied belatedly in the lane without impact. LADY ZETA stalked the pace to the top of the lane and failed to
mount a closing rally. SWEET GRACIE unhurried in the early going and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. DETERMINED JESTER dueled from between
horses two wide through the turn, took the lead at the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. MOANAS POWER set a pressured pace from the fence to
the top of the lane ane gave way. YOU'RE THE ONE was up close in the early going, dropped to the back of the field on the turn and was never a threat.

THURSDAY GIRL stalked the pace from the fence to be well placed on the bend in striking distance, angled out turning for home to take command in
mid-stretch and pulled clear holding the closers safe at the wire. PROMISE ME GOLD broke awkwardly to be a step slow, remained in hand off the pace
near the back of the pack, rallied from seven wide turning for home and closed well through the lane. GRANUAILE raced mid-pack through the turn, worked
through traffic with a stretch rally but failed to sustain the bid in deep stretch. LANDOFHOPEANDREAMS unhurried early to be near the rear of the field,
circled nine wide at the top ofthe stretch and closed willingly with a belated rally. THY NAME IS WOMAN resreved off the pace tracking the leaders through
the turn to be prominent turning for home and lacked a closing bid. PULL NO PUNCHES hit the gate at the break, trailed to upper stretch and passed tiring
rivals late in the lane. MY SOFIA ROSE set a pressured pace to midway down the lane and tired in the final eighth. FLORINE pressed the pace from three
wide to the head of the lane and faltered. BONNIE BLUE pressed the pace from between rivals to the quarter pole and came up empty. This race had a
timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
THREE CAPTAINS shuffled back at the start, settled off the early going, ridden along two deep through the far turn, angled out near the three sixteenths
pole and surged up late under strong handling. OCONEE LIFE vied for the early lead, cleared off nearing the sixteenths pole and missed in a game effort.
WE GOT THIS settled off the early pace racing in hand, made a good rail bid in the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. MR. LEFTY stalked the pace,
raced five deep into the upper stretch and had not enough late. AWESOME FANTASY dropped back to race mid pack early, raced five to six wide into the
upper stretch and flattened out late. LEGEND'S THUNDER was under a hard chase early, saved ground through the far turn and weakened. YAHMO
pressed the early pace from the outside of rivals, raced three deep through the far turn and weakened in the drive. BABY OSCAR sent along early near the
inside, checked in the early going and never threatened. HERCULES N LOVE vied for the early lead between rivals and faded. DOUBLE AUGHT BUCK
raced with the second flight early on, raced four deep around the far turn and had no response. DIALED IN A PANIC dropped back early, angled in down
the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn into the upper lane and lacked a bid. CHEATIN SONG was off slowly, lost ground to race far back and
trailed. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
LA BEFANA chased the early pace from the outside, advanced four wide by the quarter pole, made a bid leaving the run and then wore down the leader late
to get up in time to prove best under a drive. DONATE LIFE stalked the early pace setter two to three wide, made a three to four wide leaving the turn, took
over and drew clear by the furlong marker but was denied late to just miss while all out. LADYS CHANT chased the pace on the inside and cut the corner
leaving the turn to make a bid but needed more late. LUNA AMARILLA chased the pace in between rivals, two wide by the quarter pole, steadied by the
three sixteenths and angled out, then rallied well to just miss the show award. IRISH ANGEL chased the pace four to three wide, shuffled back on the turn,
came five wide into the lane and had a mild late kick. PASSIONFORQUALITY was settled early on the inside, moved out to be three wide by the quarter
pole and had no rally. CLASSY DISPOSITION was off slowly, then moved up three to four wide on the turn, came wide off the turn and was not a threat.
FINAL NOTE was away alertly to set an unchallenged lead on the inside, then was headed leaving the turn and faltered in the drive. LAZY ACES was off a
step slow and was not a factor. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
