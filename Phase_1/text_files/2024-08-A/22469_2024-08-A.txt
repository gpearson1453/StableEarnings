NEW DESTINY vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear down the home stretch and finished well. THAT IS AWESOME
hopped at the start, breaking in the back of the pack, moved up quickly, pressed the pace and was a clear second at the wire. SKY HIGH SUSAN lacked
early speed, raced outside around the final turn, made a wide gain and was just up for show. COPPER MOON broke in, went to the front, saved ground and
lacked a late kick. FRONT AND SILVER raced in the middle of the pack, saved ground around the second turn and put forth an even effort. BOLD
EXAGGERATION raced near the middle of the pack and finished evenly on the inside. PLANTS AND BIRDS void of early speed and was never a threat.
MRS. NECAISE lacked early speed, raced outside around the first turn, saved ground around the final turn and was never a threat.

Footnotes
PRADO'S PRIORITY vied for the early lead, dueling with HIS GIANT in the early going, pulled away and finished well. RECKLESS RANSOM lacked early
speed, made a steady gain, dueled with SILVER WINGS down the home stretch and prevailed for second. SILVER WINGS pressed the pace, raced close
throughout, dueled down the lane and missed second. HEARTTHROB HALO lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn and finished evenly.
MUCHO MARVIN raced in the middle of the pack in the beginning, eased back, improved position late, while finishing wide, but was no threat. MARK THE
MOOSE always raced near the back and showed little. HIS GIANT sprinted to the front, saved ground and dropped back. This race had a timing
discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
MISS CHARLIE GRAS vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drove clear down the stretch and was kept to the task. BEYOND D'ORO raced
evenly near the middle of the field in the early part, came around the turn wide and gained ground. CASHEW void of early speed, gained ground late, while
racing wide. KELLYS THE BOSS raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. MIDNIGHT TRIP lacked early speed, improved position, but
was no factor. BRAVE OLLIE dueled for the early advantage and faded. LA TRESS GRAY challenged on the front end, raced outside around the turn and
dropped back. BOURN raced within striking distance and retreated. HOLY WAR always raced near the back and was outrun.

FIVE LEAF CLOVER sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout, won under steady urging and held on well. LONG LEGGED LADY pressed the pace,
raced outside around the turn, couldn't catch the winner, but was best of others. TIME TO CLOSE raced in the middle of the field, made a late bid, proved
no match for the top two, but got up for show. HARD CANDY KISSES broke in, raced near the back in the beginning, made a steady wide gain and was
outfinished for third. DR. BOO lacked early speed, made a mild bid, but was no factor. PRINCESS MOCCASINS raced within striking distance, saved
ground around the turn and weakened. C C LLAM raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. VINCENT'S GEM void of early speed and showed
little. MALLORY'S INDIAN broke a step slow, was shut off and never mounted a bid. LIL LILAH ANN showed early speed, stopped and was distanced.

CLEARLY A TEST pressed the pace, racing behind TOMMIE G in the early going, took the advantage at the 3/4 pole, dueled to the wire with JET ROCKET
and prevailed for the win, in a hard fought battle. JET ROCKET raced within contention, being reserved, moved to the outside around the final turn, dueled
to the wire and was outfinished in a hard fought effort. TOMMIE G went to the front, saved ground and proved no match for the top two late. ISLAND GOLD
lacked early speed and trailed throughout. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

CHROME BABY unhurried in the early going, made a late wide rally and was just up. BRIAN'S IRON MIKE pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout,
drifted out down the home stretch, bumping COSMIC TRAIN, dueled to the wire and missed. COSMIC TRAIN raced near the middle of the field, made a late
bid, was bumped down the home stretch and was outfinished for the win. PARROT HEAD raced in the middle of the field, came around the final turn on the
outside, was bothered down the lane and weakened. CALICOCO went to the front, drove clear, was bothered down the home stretch and faded. READY
TO PURRFORM pressed the pace, saved ground around the final turn and faded. CHENTI lacked early speed and was never close. FORTUITY always
raced near the back and was never a threat. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE AND ALSO THE JOCKEY OF
#3 COSMIC TRAIN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #7 BRIAN'S IRON MIKE FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING
REPLAYS STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #7 FROM 2ND AND PLACED HIM THIRD.

SECRET FAITH vied for the early lead, being challenged by DEVIL'S POOL in the early going, took command around the turn, pulled away and proved
much the best. CALL ME SUSAN raced within contention, made a late inside bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. BELLA
SORELLA lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn and proved no match for the top two. QUITE THE CATCH pressed the early pace, faded and
lacked a late kick. DEVIL'S POOL dueled on the front end in the beginning, saved ground and dropped back. CANDY GIRL MISS raced in the back, was
pulled up at the 1/2 pole and vanned off.

SPIRITUAL MIRAGE went to the front, saved ground, shook off a late challenge by WILD APRIORITY and was kept to the task. WILD APRIORITY raced
near the back in the early part, moved up on the outside around the turn, drifted out down the stretch, proved no match for the winner, but was best of
others. THE LAST CAT pressed the pace, weakened and proved no match for the top two. I NITA WARRIOR broke out, vied for the early advantage and
faded. SMOKEY G showed brief speed, dropped back and was outrun. BOOTLEGGER BAY lacked early speed and trailed throughout.
