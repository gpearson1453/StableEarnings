Footnotes
JOE FROM KIEV followed the early pacesetter, ranged up and took control at the half mile pole, opened up, drifted out late and finished as an easy winner.
TITAN was void of any early speed, advanced five wide through the second turn, couldn't keep up with the winner, was no match late and finished second
best. MISTER COOPER was taken back in the early stages, raced six wide through the second turn, passed rivals out of the turn and flattened out. LAST
RUN was allowed to settle off the pace early, went four wide into the second turn, was hard ridden and was empty in the stretch. BUILDER JAK raced in mid
pack early, raced between rivals through the second turn and weakened in mid stretch. ICONIC ROCK was reserved early, raced along the inside into the
home turn, angled out and offered no late rally. DECISIVE PRIDE set a clear early pace, raced off the rail, couldn't last and gave way. FOURTY FOUR was
unhurried early, went for wide out of the home turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
RACHELS SONG tracked the early pace, ranged up four wide through the second turn, made a bid on HOCKEY, dueled briefly with that rival, took control in
mid stretch, drifted in and edged clear. BEIRA was unhurried early, advanced five wide through the second turn, angled out to the seven path in the stretch
and finished second best. ALCOHOL was void of any early speed, raced five wide through the turn, shifted out to the six path and finished evenly late.
FREE TO ROAM was reserved early from the inside, angled out through the home turn and finished belatedly. HOCKEY set a clear early pace, raced off the
rail into the home turn, met the bid of the winner, couldn't sustain the run and weakened. NEOM CITY was not far back early raced three wide into the
second turn and gave way. CONTESSA'S SONG was allowed to settle from the inside and flattened out.

Footnotes
RAKA RAKA CRUZ set a clear early pace, raced off the rail through the turn, opened up, kept on and was best today. MIDNIGHT CHAOS raced in mid pack
early, advanced four wide through the turn, was gaining late and needed more ground. CALYPSO CHARLIE followed the early pace, raced three wide and
weakened. PUTMAN stalked the early pace from the inside, kept on along the inside through the stretch and finished evenly late. MR. AMERICAN was
unhurried early, raced along the inside through the turn, angled out in the stretch and finished belatedly. FORTY FLASH was allowed to settle early, raced
five wide into the turn angled out and offered no late rally. FAST N STEADY was void of any early speed from between rivals and never fired.
