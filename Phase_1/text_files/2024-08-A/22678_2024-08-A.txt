KERRI'S MIRACLE hopped inward hitting the gate, bore in bumping hard with CLIFTON'S BALLERINA forcing that one into MISS SPRINGESTEEN at the
start, prompted the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead near the quarter pole, shook clear under right handed urging before the furlong marker and
proved best under a strong hand ride. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE with the second flight along the inside, altered course six wide at the top of the stretch and
rallied for second. THE MIRACLE KIUT vied for the lead thee wide and went evenly. SEEYOUINMOTOWN trailed early and had a mild late rally three wide.
MISS SPRINGSTEEN was bumped at the start, shifted outside, raced widest down the backstretch and passed tiring rivals late. TWENTY FOUR KARAT
set the pace along the inside for nearly a half then weakened. CHECK OUT LINE improved position along the rail through the turn and into the stretch then
came up empty in the final furlong. CLIFTONS BALLERINA was bumped hard at the start and through early. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY
SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
MAGICGIRL broke alertly and dropped inside soon after the start, set the pace for three sixteenths of a mile, gave up the advantage before the turn, came
on again inside rivals to make the lead at the top of the stretch, dug in gamely when challenged by the runner up and proved best by a narrow margin under
strong handling. INCESSANT stalked the early pace, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole, matched strides with the winner to the wire and was
denied. BAREBACK FUN was forced inward by the winner soon after the start, never far back and finished with good courage four wide. BLUEBIRD SING
trailed into the stretch and passed tiring rivals through the stretch. J P'S GLADYS was in tight at the start and failed to menace. BLUE SAGE shifted out and
rushed to the lead four wide past the seven sixteenths pole, kept the advantage to the quarter pole then was used up.

TITEBLUEJEANS well placed, angled out to the six path in upper stretch, closed rapidly under left handed urging through the final stages and was along in
time. WILD MARIAH chased the leader into the stretch, swung wide, inherited the lead in the six path at the furlong marker then was no match for the
winner. BEAUTIFUL SCORE trailed into the stretch and found her best stride late two wide. ZASHIXIARAYAN bobbled at the start and failed to menace.
MOST ADORABLE failed to respond. WAY OF THE WORLD was no factor. WHISKEY DIAMOND sprinted to a large lead soon after the start, set the pace
until mid stretch then stopped. MI CANCION was outrun.

KRABI made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace while nicely rated and lasted under strong handling. PEARLINTHEROUGH trailed into the far
turn, swung wide then closed determinedly in the seven path through the final furlong but was too late. FULL TIME STRUTIN hopped at the start, chased
the winner three then two wide, drifted inward despite left handed urging past the furlong marker then faded late. SKY well placed, failed to respond.

momentum. UNWHIRLED settled three wide and was through after a half. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF RIPLEY

Footnotes
ALTER THE STARS away alertly, set all the pace and widened through deep stretch to win as much the best under an energetic hand ride. REVENUE
TRAIN never far back, offered a mild bid three wide into the stretch and finished well clear for second. SPITE LITE pressured the winner two wide to the top
of the stretch then weakened. ELKO was no factor. CATCHMENOW had brief speed.
