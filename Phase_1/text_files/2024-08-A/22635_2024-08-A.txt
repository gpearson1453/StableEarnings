Footnotes
BULLOCK drafted back off the leading pair through the opening furlong, gathered momentum after being put to some asking leaving the three eighths,
angled five wide into the lane, closed relentlessly under right handed asks, wore down LOVE TO EAT through the final yards to take command and was
edging away at the wire. LOVE TO EAT took over soon after the break, dropped in and set a pressured pace, spurted clear past the five sixteenths, was
guided two to three wide under a hustling ride into the stretch, kept on under a drive past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly nearing the wire.
HARMONIZING , away alertly, forced the pace outside LOVE TO EAT, failed to keep up with that one entering the lane, pursued to the three sixteenths then
weakened.

Footnotes
MONDAY MORNING QB , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gained command at the head of the stretch, responded to the whip in mid stretch
and eagerly drew off. UNSTABLE PRINCE , unhurried down the backstretch, circled the turn three wide and rallied between horses. SHERIFF RONNIE
sprinted clear soon after the break, moved over to the two path leaving the backstretch, remained in the two path around the turn and gradually weakened
through the stretch. GROUP HUG trailed for a half mile, circled horses on the turn three wide, floated to the four path entering the stretch and had a mild
rally outside rivals. ICING stayed along the inner rail around the turn, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. SUMO was a brief factor between
horses down the backstretch and faltered on the turn.

FIVE DREAMS sped to the early lead between foes, dropped in and was headed after a quarter mile, stayed on to duel under nice rating, responded when
seriously shaken up in upper stretch, regained command a furlong out then steadily edged clear under left handed encouragement. JOHNYZ FROM
ALBANY broke outward, corrected and edged up three deep, poked a head in front entering the turn, sparred outside the winner around the turn and into
the lane, could not quicken with that one leaving the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. DURANTE had speed to the inside of the top two, eased back
a bit after a furlong, was under heavy pressure pursuing past the five sixteenths but came up empty.

MEET ME AT MUNDIS raced in the two path between horses around the turn, disputed the pace throughout and determinedly prevailed. SUGA STEVE ,
four deep around the turn, disputed the pace the final three furlongs and just missed in a game performance. CAJUN DREAM stalked the duel, saved
ground on the turn, moved to the two path approaching the stretch and rallied inside the top pair. BACKNTHEWOODS showed speed between horses, was
rated back near the half mile pole, swung to the path turning for home and finished willingly outside rivals. KADRI disputed the pace racing in the three path
between horses and gave way the final furlong. JAMMING EDDY showed speed along the inner rail, battled to the stretch then gave way.

NEXT GIRL , bumped at the break, was firmly rated back from between rivals nearing the five eighths, angled out and commenced a four wide run leaving
the half mile marker, closed in outside rivals to threaten a furlong out, took over heading to the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a mild drive. SHINE ON
MOON sped to a brief early lead then was taken back off a clearing SOCIETY BALL exiting the chute, tracked three wide, moved up under asking and
challenged soon into the lane, wrested command inside the quarter pole, maintained the advantage under a drive leaving mid stretch, ceded to the winner
soon after but continued gamely to save the place. SOCIETY BALL accelerated to a clear lead leaving the chute, set a rated pace towards the inner rail,
was guided outward when confronted in upper stretch, fought on to the inside of rivals past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. BROOKLYN GIRL saved
ground while dropping back into the turn, altered out five wide for the drive and came back on a bit. I CAN DO IT broke inward bumping the winner,
corrected and raced forwardly and between runners early on, dropped to the inner rail around the far turn, stayed inside but failed to generate a solid run.
CATCH THE KITTEN , three deep early, chased off the rail mid turn, swung out some in upper stretch but failed to rally. COVER THE SPREAD stalked two
wide, was pushed along mid turn, lacked a punch entering the lane and retreated.

IRISH EXIT stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the two path to bid for the lead near the three eighths pole, drifted out at the head of
stretch, continued to battle outside BRILLIANT ICE through the stretch and prevailed in an extended drive. BRILLIANT ICE hugged the inner rail,
throughout, battled with the winner and just missed in a game effort. FEELING WOOZY advanced three deep on the turn, was fanned four wide by the
winner turning for home and flattened out. NO CENTS stumbled a couple strides after the break, rushed up between horses mid way down the backstretch,
saved ground on the turn and tired. QUALITY CHIC , steadied in close quarters inside the five eighths, was no factor.

bid three deep mid turn, shook clear under some asking entering the lane, responded to firmer encouragement past the three sixteenths, steadily widened
and was kept to some pressure to the wire. VIROLOGIST , nudged along stalking the pace, crept up behind the leading trio mid turn, swung out five wide
into the stretch, chased past mid stretch then finished evenly through the final seventy yards. BEATIFUL KARLA disputed the pace two wide and outside
SHEHERHERS, clung to a narrow lead battling between horses mid turn, ceded command heading to the stretch, faded in the final furlong but did manage
to narrowly get the show. SHEHERHERS vied along the rail, was under pressure to keep pace leaving the five sixteenths then faded. ALWAYS FORWARD
, urged from the gate, raced off the pace while saving some ground, swung out for the drive but failed to generate a run.
