Footnotes
COASTARANDO was well placed, bid two wide after three eighths, dueled the runnerup hand, boot and whip and prevailed tenaciously. SASSY EINSTEIN
prompted the pace to the second turn, was fanned three wide to the stretch then battled the winner through the drive but missed. TEASPOON OF PEPPER
took up sharply at the start, had no speed and could only pass tiring rivals. STEEL NERVES hustled to the front, set the pace for three eighths, was
overtaken nearing the stretch and weakened. VISION OF THE KAT had no speed and was not a factor.

TIZ CURLY JOE was outrun to the backstretch, rallied three wide and made a stout run on the second turn, pushed to the front into the stretch and won
going away. GATO NEGRO hustled to contest the pace for three furlongs, could not withstand the winner's bid but had enough left to save the place.
BATTLEOF TRAFALGAR had no speed, was two then three wide to the stretch but did not threaten the top two. MIDNIGHT DADDY dueled outside of
GATO NEGRO then pushed past and eased in, saved ground on the far turn but tired through the final furlong. LONGFORD saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
CHEDOODLE RYLEE was on the pace from the outset, pushed away from a rival on the far turn then drew clear driving. SENSATIONAL CITY disputed the
pace outside the winner for three furlongs, was outkicked on the second turn but easily held the place. LITTLEQUEENOFMEAN got outsprinted early then
saved ground but lacked the needed late response. SPORTS FOR WOMEN chased the pace three wide to the stretch then came up empty. ELLE
VICTOIRE broke out, was straightened but was also outrun to the first turn while widest of all then continued wide throughout and did not threaten.
