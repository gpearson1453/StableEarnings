BREEZIN BRIANNE away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of SOMEDAY LADY, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival in
the run down the backstretch, took control approaching the final turn, and drew clear over the final furlong under confident handling. WHY NOTS A
WYNNER away well and stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, advanced three wide midway down the backside
to loom a danger, rallied three wide through the turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. SOMEDAY LADY was off a
step slow, and angled in to vie for the early lead from the inside of BREEZIN BRIANNE entering the first turn, battled from the inside of that rival in the run
down the backstretch, was unable to match strides with her pace rival entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. MISS LARUE broke
sharply, but was devoid of early speed while trailing the field into the backstretch, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

MOUNT DOOM away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the
backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, took the narrowest of leads into the lane, and inched clear late under confident handling. PIONEER
STORM KING away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final
turn, was no match for the winner late, but closed willingly from along the rail in the lane to prove easily second best. MAKENA'S JOY broke sharply and
was carried out entering the first turn, settled off the early pace in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed three wide in
the drive to garner a share. CHICK COMMAND settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid
three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to mount a serious late threat while finishing two wide in the drive. EXIT TUNNEL was off a step slow, and
drifted out while running off behind the pacesetters entering the first turn, settled into a stalking trip in the run down the backside, bore out approaching the
final turn, and was not persevered with over the final furlong.

AVANA unhurried early while trailing the field into the stretch the first time, saved ground through the second turn to close some ground on the leaders,
eased off the rail midway down the backstretch, and quickly engulfed the leaders four wide midway through the final turn to assume command, and was
geared down late as the easiest of winners. BROOKE MAGIC away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through
the stretch the first time, moved swiftly from along the rail midway down the backstretch to take a narrow lead into the final turn, was overtaken midway
through the turn, but battled gamely three wide in the drive to prove second best. SUNBLAZE settled well off the contested early pace while racing one out
from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained her position into the backstretch, trailed the field into the final turn before launching her bid one out
from the rail, and closed steadily from along the rail in the drive to get up for a share. DREAMING D'ORO broke sharply and tracked the leaders through the
stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her tracking trip in the run down the backside, shifted four wide entering the final turn, but
was outfinished late while racing three wide in the drive. SISTER ELLA away alertly and pressed the pace from the outside of LONIE MO through the stretch
the first time, continued to battle for the lead in the run down the backstretch, was quickly overtaken entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.
LONIE MO raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of SISTER ELLA through the stretch the first
time, and in the run down the backside, was quickly overhauled entering the final turn, and had little to offer over the final furlong.

INFINITE PATIENCE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, opened a clear advantage through the final turn, and widened that margin late while under confident handling. BUNNY
away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, held her position in the run down the backstretch,
rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive to hold the place. MATSQUI settled at the back of the pack
while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to bide her time in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the
final turn, and finished willingly from along the inside in the drive to get up for a share in the closing strides. AIR FORCE away well and stalked the leaders
through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backside, commenced her bid three wide
entering the final turn, and closed two out from the rail in the drive. VIVA LA VINO settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the
stretch the first time, held her position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive.
WE B THREE stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, held her position in the run down the backside, rallied
four wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

DIOCLES broke sharply and was taken in hand to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his
trip in the run down the backstretch, commenced his bid from just off the rail entering the final turn, briefly awaited room along the inside entering the lane,
before tipping four wide to find a seam in mid stretch and drove through late from between rivals to get up in time. WHAT'S SHAKIN clipped heels and
stumbled in the opening strides, and settled at the back of the pack in the run to the first turn, continued to bide his time at the rear of the field in the run
down the backstretch, launched his bid two wide entering the final turn, shifted to the outside for the drive entering the lane, and closed with a rush to just
miss. AUGUST RAIN stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, inched closer into a tracking trip in the run
down the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly five wide in the drive to just miss. J DUTTON away alertly and dueled
for the lead from the outside of MONEYSHOT through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backside and into
the final turn, and battled two wide from between rivals in the lane to just miss. WESTMINSTER tracked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time
while racing one out from the rail, continued from a tracking trip in the run down the backside, rallied three wide from between rivals through the final turn to
battle for the lead into the stretch, but was outfinished late in a game effort. MONEYSHOT rushed up from along the rail to vie for the lead from along the rail
entering the first turn, continued to battle from the inside of J DUTTON through the stretch the first time and in the run down the backside, took a narrow
advantage into the final turn, but gave way grudgingly late. DEAL EM stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing three out from the
rail, continued with a wide trip throughout, and faded in the late stages. PISCO away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at
the rail, struggled to maintain his position in the run down the backstretch, and had little to offer late.

Footnotes
ARTISTIC JEWLER raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, and controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch the first time,
increased her advantage through the lane the second time, held a clear lead in the run down the backside the second time and into the final turn, and held
FAMILY BIZ safely at bay late to prove best. FAMILY BIZ settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch the first time,
moved up through the third turn to take a stalking trip in the run down the backside the final time, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and
finished determinedly four wide in deep stretch to prove clearly second best. BROOKYS TAPIT settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail
through the stretch the first time, continued to bide his time well off the pacesetter through the stretch the second time, steadied slightly when in tight
quarters entering the third turn, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed with late interest from along the rail in the drive to get
up for a share. TEX HANLEY lagged well back early while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch the first time, continued to bide his
time near the back of the field through the stretch the second time, began to show interest in the rundown the backstretch the final time, rallied one out from
the rail entering the final turn, but needed more late when called upon. FORT LANGLEY tracked the leader into the backstretch the first time while racing
one out from the rail, held his position through the stretch the second time and into the backstretch the final time, continued with a tracking trip in the run to
the final turn, rallied three wide through the turn, but was outfinished in the late going. JOCK TALK unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch
the first time, remained at the back of the pack through the stretch the second time, and into the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final
turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. DAPPER DON stalked the leader into the backstretch the first time while saving ground at the
rail, began to struggle to maintain his position entering the third turn, dropped back steadily entering the backstretch the final time, and was eased over the
final three eighths of a mile, but walked off under his own power.
