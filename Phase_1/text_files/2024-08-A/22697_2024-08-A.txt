DEVILISH SMILE vied for the early lead, gained a slim lead leaving the backstretch, responded to a challenge from ALBERTA and was kept to task under
handling. ALBERTA saved ground inside, shifted out to the four path in the far turn, bid nearing the quarter pole but was unable to stall the winner and
finished clear second best. SMOKIN JOY raced in second flight while four wide, and offered a late mild bid. SPOT ON JOLEE trailed and bid belatedly.
SUNBIZ was four wide in the opening turn, and lacked a bid. WICKED WIZZY vied through the opening turn, and faded gradually along the rail.

TIGERITO contended the early pace, disposed of a rival at the quarter pole then responded to a challenge from an inside rival, and prevailed under a long
drive. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH saved ground inside, lodged a bid at the three sixteenth pole, but was outfinished. BEAUGATTI pressed the pace while four
wide, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and flattened out. BOSS MAN CAN tracked while four to five wide, chased the leaders through the
final turn, and lacked the closing response needed. MOONSHINE NOW stalked the pace in the two path, and tired.

ANTHONY'S BEST attended the pace while three wide, gained the advantage leaving the backstretch, drove clear into the stretch and was geared down.
LAST OF WAR sat just off the pace from the rail, shifted out to the three path in the final turn, and finished with good energy. SAMURAI CHALLENGE was
reserved off the early pacesetters, gained closer order in the far turn, raced wide at the head of the lane, and was all out through the stretch. MOUNT LOKI
pressed the pace from between foes, was unable to keep pace with rivals and gave way. MORE THAN A FLASH was never involved. SUNNY WAY was not
a factor.
