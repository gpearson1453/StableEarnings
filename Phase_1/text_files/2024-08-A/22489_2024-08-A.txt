Footnotes
MAXIMUM PROMISE led from a pair of outer prompters into the backstretch, drew off while well in hand nearing the five sixteenths pole, felt a left handed
crop to continue to widen entering the final furlong and was ridden out to the finish. EXTRADITION trailed in the four to three path into the turn, advanced
four wide turning for home to claim place entering the lane and was no match for the winner. COLONEL YORKE tracked from the three path, advanced
between rivals nearing the three furlong pole to gain place from an inner pair with five sixteenths to go, but was bested by an outer bidder for that position
entering the lane. COACH CLINT vied for the lead between a pair of rivals while racing in the three path into the backstretch sustained pressure outside of
the eventual winner into the far turn, but yielded nearing the five sixteenths pole and weakened between horses. CRYSTAL HILL broke slowly, tracked
along the inside, chased around the turn and faded turning for home. JACKSON'S ROAR prompted outside of the leading pair and from the four path, but
faded in the five path around the far turn.

Footnotes
ECHO SOUND pressed the top pair from the four path, ranged up to bid leaving the furlong grounds and drove past. EVANESCENCE broke slowly, tracked
along the inside, took aim inside of the leaders entering the final furlong, slipped through to bid leaving the sixteenth pole but needed more. SWEET
SERAPHINE prompted outside of the leader and from the three path while between horses, vied among foes into the final furlong, but was outkicked by
bidders on either side. GLISTENING GAL set a pressured pace while remaining a path off of the inside, then yielded between horses at the sixteenth pole.
SUNDAY DISRUPTOR was off slowly, pursued from the three path and among foes early on, advanced between horses while tracking turning for home,
chased the leading quartet in to the final furlong, tipped out and stayed on late. SISTER CARLIE broke a step slow, lacked speed in three to four path,
encountered traffic behind a pair of rivals in upper stretch, tipped in and moved up, then was found to have bled. NOSLEEPTILBROOKLYN laid off of the
pace along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch and lacked a bid. SPUNDERELLA broke slowly and was last away, pursued four wide and tired. LA
BUKANA stalked the leading trio from the five path and faded entering the lane. RITA'S LEGACY lacked speed two wide and made little impact. KINZIE
QUEEN leaned in at the start, pursued two wide and between horses before weakening. COLD trailed along the inside and was outrun.

CYCLONE MISCHIEF brushed with an outer rival at the start, stalked the top pair from the four path, then from the two path around the turn, claimed place
while taking aim outside of the leader entering the final furlong, dueled into the final sixteenth and edged past. RHYME SCHEMES brushed with an inner foe
leaving the gate, showed the way in the three path as an outer rival applied mild pressure, shook free of that one entering the lane before being confronted
by an outer challenger leaving the furlong grounds, dueled with that bidder into deep stretch but was bested late. AWESOME AARON pressed the leader
from teh four path around the turn, yielded entering the lane, lost place to an inner foe in midstretch and lasted for show late. SOLIDIFY laid off of the pace
two wide, failed to menace and was unable to reel in a tiring rival for show. PAYNE lacked speed along the inside, trailed while shifting out to the four path
entering the lane and failed to factor.

GLOBAL STAGE vied three to two wide into the turn, inched clear traveling well in hand leaving the five sixteenths pole and held sway under a drive. AL
AMEEQ tracked four to five wide into the turn, vied for place turning for home, dueled with an inner rival for that position in the final furlong and prevailed.
DAZZLEMESILVER vied two wide and between horses before his inner counterpart checked into the turn, yielded to his outer counterpart leaving the five
sixteenths pole, shifted out and battled for place with an outer rival into the final furlong, but was bested. SUPREMELY laid off of the pace in the three path,
awaited racing room while blocked behind rivals nearing the lane, tipped in and stayed on while one paced. UNCLE BERLEY broke a beat slow, tracked
three to four wide and between horses, vied for place turning for home, but gave way nearing midstretch. EDDIE M trailed along the inside around the turn,
then improved position. LANDLORD prompted inside of a pair of rivals early on, checked into the turn, recovered to chase around the bend but faded
entering the lane. TIGER'S LEGACY hopped at the start, stalked two wide before moving three wide and between horses into the turn, chased turning for

EVENT DETAIL dropped back after the start to trail the field two wide into the backstretch, came under urging in the three path around the turn, swung five
wide nearing the lane, rallied widest to reel in the clear leader in the final sixteenth and inched ahead while put to hand late. GATLINBURG bobbled subtly
and brushed with an outer rival at the start, prompted two wide and between horses, forged an advantage passing the five furlong pole, showed the way
from a pair of outer prompters into the far turn, cleared entering the lane in the two path, but was collared by an outer bidder leaving the furlong grounds and
was bested late. LAUGHNOWCRYLATER set the pace along the inside early on, but was headed by a trio of outer rivals approaching the nine sixteenths
pole, chased the leaders around the far turn, sustained stride entering the lane and kept on to regain show with a sixteenth to go. STAR TOPPER
exchanged brushes with an outer rival at the start, raced at the rear in the two path, shifted out four wide and between horses turning for home then stayed
on willingly. AZTECA'S GOLD tracked two wide, tipped to the three path into the turn, then chased mildly between horses in the final furlong. MERIT stalked
four deep early on, applied pressure outside of the top pair into the far turn, sustained pressure chasing the leader nearing the lane, but failed to keep pace
entering it and faded between horses at the furlong grounds. ON MY HONOR brushed with an inner rival at the start, pressed three wide and between
horses, then two wide down the backstretch but weakened turning for home. ASMODEUS traded contact with an inner rival at the start, tracked along the
inside, but was done early and eased through the lane.

EMPIRICAL MISCHIEF set a clear pace and held sway. TAVERNA pursued from midpack along the inside fanned four wide into the lane, rallied to bid for
place at the sixteenth pole and prevailed between horses. EUNOMIA tracked two to three wide, ranged up to gain place nearing the lane, delayed changing
leads until leaving the furlong grounds, lost place to an outer bidder late and saved show. LOW KEY broke a step slow, steadied behind rivals early on,
advanced in the three path and between horses around the turn, swung five wide into the lane, bid for place in the final furlong but evened out. NORTHERN
VOYAGE broke slowly, trailed in the three path, advanced between horses nearing the lane and ran on willingly. MOON OVER CHOCTAW bumped with an
inner rival early on, lacked speed in the four path then moved up. RANDO leaned in and checked subtly at the start, bumped with an outer rival early on,
saved ground to no avail. VOLATILE MARKET stalked three to two wide, lost place nearing the lane and weakened. PRINCESS LOLLY chased forwardly
tucking to the inside into the turn, then weakened between horses. JUST ONE KISS tracked three to four wide and between horses, floated six wide into the
lane and faded. HEART'S COMPASS pursued four to five wide and tired.

AWESOME TREAT stalked along the inside, split foes two wide to bid inside of the leaders at the furlong grounds, dueled with an outer pair late and
prevailed. RED CARPET READY stalked two to three wide, bid in the four path in upper stretch, dueled between horses late and missed. BLING broke a
beat slow and was last away at the start, laid off of the pace in the two to three path, swung five wide in upper stretch, ran on with a grinding charge to bid
leaving the sixteenth pole, but was denied late. B G WARRIOR set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed in upper stretch and faded. L J'S EMMA was
fractious in the starting gate, trailed three wide and made little impact. CURRENT CLIMATE laid off of the pace along the inside, then lost her rider while
avoiding a fallen foe in the final sixteenth and walked off. OVA CHARGED vied two wide, then in the three path and between horses in upper stretch, but fell
at the sixteenth pole and was euthanized. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
CAMEO PERFORMANCE trailed in the two path, took an awkward step inside the half mile pole, gained ground in the three to four path around the far turn
before swinging five wide into the lane, rallied to bid at the sixteenth pole and edged past. ABRUMAR vied two wide through a soft pace, inched clear at the
furlong grounds before meeting an outer challenge shortly after, and was bested late. GREEN LIGHT laid off of the pace in the three to four path, crept
closer four wide around the far turn, stalled out tucking three wide whlie within striking range entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival leaving
the furlong grounds and chased the top pair home while hanging on his left lead. OSCAR'S WORLD vied along the inside in a slow pace, but yielded with a
furlong to go. EL MATADOR stalked along the inside, chased entering the lane and lacked a bid. DOMINGO tracked two wide and between horses, then
faded turning for home. BEYOND STOKED stalked three wide, tugged as the pace slowed entering the backstretch, pursued within striking range between
horses nearing the lane but faded in upper stretch.
