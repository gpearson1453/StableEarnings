Footnotes
BAXLEY with the pace while between rivals in the run up the backstretch, dueled into the stretch in the two path, put that rival away with a furlong to run,
kicked well clear under steady handling. ABSOLUTE CHAOS narrowly set a pressured pace along the inside, raced on equal terms with the winner into the
stretch, could not match strides with that one the final furlong, all out to last for the place. GOOD APPLE pressed the pace three wide four just under a half,
fell back off the top pair turning for home, roused, rerallied a bit to be coming back for the second spot. LARRY THE POET last to leave, fell further back off
the first flight the opening quarter inside, came on the outside for the drive, lacking a closing kick while widest through the lane.

Footnotes
GLOBAL EMPIRE broke outward and slowly, moved up to race within striking distance three wide, came on the outside for the drive, set down, closed with
good resolve to kick down the leader late and prove best. DOUBLE THUNDER prompted the leader from the outside, continued to pressure the pacesetter
under confident handling the middle half mile, took over entering the stretch, shook clear but could not contain the winner. SLAVA UKRAINI rank with in a bit
tight along the inside past the wire the first time, pulled hard through the first turn, settled, saved ground second bend, slipped through a narrow opening
along the rail upper stretch when moving closer, flattened out. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE crossed over the show the way early, set a pressured pace under
light restraint the middle half mild, offered brief resistance to the runner up then steadily weakened when headed by that one upper stretch. WHERE'D THE
DAY GO fell back to trail after the start, continued back, failed to muster a response in the drive.

Footnotes
CHARLIE LIGHTNING broke on top, set all the pace while in hand for a half, let out a notch into the lane, held the runner up at bay the length off the stretch
and held on well under steady handling late. PARKER moved up after the start to prompt the winner from the outside, three to four wide turn, could not get
to the winner through the stretch, clearly second best. CHRISTMAS PRESENT within striking distance from the start along the inside, light restraint through
the turn, crept slightly closer when straightened for home then lacked a further bid. PADDY'S HOUSE in the second flight while racing between horses up
the backstretch and through the turn, came up empty for the drive in lacking a closing response. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER also in the second group,
raced three wide and between rivals through the turn, also found lacking when the real running began at the head of the lane. LORD GRANTHAM broke
back, moved outside, lodged a four wide move to join the second flight through the turn, widest for the drive, lacked a closing kick as well.

Footnotes
SHE BE SHEEHAN took control after the start along the inside, set a soft pace while continuing to save ground, remained in hand far turn, shook clear into
the stretch when called on for some turn, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. MORNING LINE NEWS prompted the winner through those
modest fractions while outside that one, could not get to that rival through the lane while slowly closing the gap late. EMITYAAZ forwardly placed along the
inside, continued to race within striking distance up the backstretch, covered up along the rail through most of the second turn, came up empty for the drive.
NO NANNETTE NO four wide when with the main body through the first turn, continued back while remaining well out in the strip up the backstretch, angled
a bit to be three wide through the second bend, went evenly down the stretch in lacking a closing response. CAIRO SUMMER balked a bit at loading, last to
leave, lacked speed three wide while pulling through the first turn, four wide out of the final turn, continued back in having little for the drive. NIFF went one
paced while racing three wide, had nothing for drive.

Footnotes
NAGY AND DA BEARS broke alertly, soon clear, set all the pace, continued to maintain a daylight advantage through the stretch while under steady
handling. RED RIZZLER settled off the early pace when clear, cut the corner into the stretch, steered out a bit when straightened for home, closed with
some interest to be slowly narrowing the gap on the winner late. MILLARD A MAVERICK veered in at the start to spot the field a couple of lengths,
continued to lacked speed into the turn, came on the outside for the drive, finished with good late energy to be up for the show. MIDTERM within striking
distance while out in the course, continued three wide through the turn, lugged in on two occasions nearing midstretch bumping UNCLE CHUCKLE the
second time, was straightened for finish up evenly and be caught for the show. LONE RETURN went one paced while racing just off the inside, lacked
closing kick. UNCLE CHUCKLE chased the winner from the outside for three furlongs, was tiring in upper stretch when bumped by a lugging MIDTERM,
continued to weaken. RAISERICHIESRANSOM fell back to trail after the start and was never a threat.

Footnotes
RAVIN'S TOWN moved up between horses to get command after the start, clear into the turn, extended that advantage through the bend and into the
straight while setting a lively pace, continued to hold a sizable advantage past the furlong marker, enough left to last in the waning strides. PROFESSOR
HIGGINS back off the pace while racing toward the inside, shifted out approaching the furlong grounds, late surge to be rapidly getting to the winner late.
PONCHO ATTACK dropped back to trail immediately after the start, continued to lag through the turn, swung out six wide for the drive, finished willingly well
out in the course to be in time for the show, too late for the top pair. RIGHTEOUS FREEDOM back off the early pace and the inside, angled out entering the
stretch, advanced to race closest to the winner with a furlong to run, flattened out to lose that second position in the final sixteenth. A P BLAZING GREEN
broke with the leaders, shuffled back between horses soon after, dropped to the inside to save ground through the turn, came up empty for the drive.
FRISSON forwardly placed up the backstretch while three wide and between horses, had little for the drive. NAVE closest to the leader while off the inside,
was finished after three furlongs. SECESSION forwardly placed the opening quarter outside, four wide early turn, fell back, lost crop 3/16, trailed home.

JOYZELLA unhurried early, began to advance midway on the turn, came three wide for the drive, collared the two leaders past the furlong marker, drew well
clear under token encouragement late to win ridden out. ISABELLA'S BEAUTY away in good order, showed the way up the backstretch inside, held a
narrow advantage nearing the furlong marker over a second foe, proved no match for the winner the final sixteenth, drew clear again of the other speed to
be clearly second best. SANITARIUM closest to the runner up up the backstretch and into the turn, moved to challenge that one late in the turn, dueled
upper stretch, also was no match for the winner while falling back to finish best of the rest. MURPHY'S COMBO settled off the pace and the inside, three
wide through the turn, went evenly through the stretch. TIZMEONEMORETIME off slowly, remained back in failing to menace. JACQUEK dwelt at the start,
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TIZ A COUNTRY GIRL allowed the two leaders to go early, stalked that pair the middle four furlongs, darted through a hold along the rail turning for home,
quickly clear, maintained a comfortable advantage the final furlong while being kept to task. LOTTA ROSES broke in to bother a pair of inner rivals, settled
off the pace and the inside, dropped to the rail nearing the furlong marker and rallied up the inside to be clear for the place, no threat to the winner.
KINGSBURY DREAM bobbled slightly at the start, raced back off the pace, staged a mild rally to be along for the show, no match for the top two. APRIL'S
GEM carried out into the first turn, worked way clear onto the backstretch, dueled into the far turn closest to but not on the inside, allowed the winner the rail
turning for home and began to weaken. ROMANTIC ATTACK raced in mid pack, made little impact in lacking a significant closing response. SILKY
WARRIOR (IRE) squeezed back at the start, failed to menace. SENSE OF SELF bothered at the start, remained always back. TAPERINEA got out into the
first turn when dueling for the lead, rank, fell back off the other speed, rebid before a half, second duel, gave way while getting out a bit again turning for
home. LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT in mid pack early, was finished after a half, continued to back up through the lane. WINNING PLACE PICK 8 NUMBERS:

Footnotes
HURTS SO BAD close from the start off the inside, quickly took over midway on the turn to be clear into the stretch, held the runner up safe late under
steady handling. VIOLENT GIGI in the second flight while off the inside, came three wide for the drive, roused, steadily drifted in while closing the gap on the
winner late, flattened late while finishing up on the rail. MON AMI FUZZIE void of speed for a half, managed a rail rally to annex the show, not a threat to the
top two. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN went one paced throughout, improved position slightly through the lane while never dangerous. OVER CALENDARED
bothered at the start, raced back early as a result, came five wide for the drive, also improved only a bit without posing a serious threat. PERFECT WAGER
void of any early foot, was never a factor while racing toward the inside. Z U SOON flashed some early speed along the inside, relinquished the advantage
to the winner early in the turn and began a steady retreat. IRONMAN RICHIE broke out, bothered foe, was straightened to chased the two leaders up the
backstretch, stopped by late in the turn, far back, jogged in, walked off.

Footnotes
TOWERING STORM forward early, tracked the pace under confident handling while off the inside for five furlongs, let out a notch midway on the final turn,
came three wide for the drive, set down, brisk handling, all out late to prove best. C'EST MAGNIFIQUE lacked speed, saved some ground into the stretch,
angled out, late bid between horses and inside the winner, not enough for that one late while prevailing for the runner up spot. MAN ON ATTACK broke in,
broke in good order, rated in showing the way toward the inside, continued to hold a clear advantage past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the
top two late. BONS TEMPS ROULE floated in at the break, void of any early speed, lodged a mild, belated rally off the inside to improve position.
MONSTERONTHEMIDWAY settled off the pace toward the inside, lacked a closing response. NEW YEAR SURPRISE four wide when with the second
flight first turn, lodged a mild move outside to pressure the runner the the middle half, gave way in the drive.
