Footnotes
CHIPOTLE PEPPER pulled the rider from the outside to clear easily on the rail for the lead down the backstretch, set the pace with no opposition around the
bend and opened up down the lane with mild urging for a impressive front end score. LIAM'S AWESOME was reserved early, co-trailing on the outside,
began to pick up horses one by one circling through the turn, angled out widest with momentum in the five path for the drive and won the place share but
was a distant second behind the dominant winner. SILENT PASSION stalked outside in the beginning, travelled outside a rival in the third tier going around
the turn, angled to the four path between horses battling for the place share turning for home and finished up to hold for the show award at the finish line.
JUST A GEM was a touch slow into stride on the start, co-trailed on the fence in the early stages, just started to offer a finish on the fence turning for home,
lost her path at the furlong marker, shifted just outside off the tiring foe and had good late energy to close in for a minor role at the wire. ON PARADISE HILL
was content to sit behind the pacesetter along the back straight, chased, but was losing ground to the winner throughout the turn and wilted inside rivals in
the final sixteenth. HOULIHAN stalked near the rear on the inside, travelled on the rail in the third flight through the turn making little impact, drifted inwards
to be on the rail when weakening in mid-stretch and could no factor late. GENEVA was in a good spot, alone watching the top two runners down the
backside, took closer order at the three-furlong pole to track the frontrunner outside around the bend, had little left to offer when urged between rivals in the
three path by the quarter pole and folded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ROCK TO FAME was hustled at the start to take command down the backside, continued to roll along up front through the turn, was kept to the task in the
stretch and was never challenged at any point of the race. FIFTY B M G watched the leader while nestled on the fence down the backside, chased the loose
frontrunner through the turn, valiantly tried to reel in the winner in the stretch but was no match and stubbornly held for the place share at the finish line.
COHERENCE was unhurried to trail in the early going, began to commence a run when splitting foes at the quarter pole and offered a good late surge in the
final furlong on the fence to just miss closing in on the place share at the wire. CELENTANO stalked in the third flight between horses, made a good move
on the rail midturn, dueled for the show money inside runners at the top of the stretch and faded a touch late to settle on the fringes in the end. UNDER
SURVEILLANCE travelled three deep outside foes close to the back going down the back straight, made little headway while three wide around the bend,
angled to be five wide for the stretch run and passed tired runners in the lane. DISSECTOLOGIST tracked the pacesetter between rivals in the beginning,
tried to keep pace in the third flight with runners on both sides throughout the turn and gave way in the four path at the top of the lane. MR. MARSHALL was
scrubbed three deep outside, tracking the frontrunner, continued the three wide trip but was going the wrong way around the bend and yielded in the five
path by upper stretch. RY PIE stalked near the rear on the rail down the backside, could not get involved when hard ridden on the fence around the turn and
never factored inside down the stretch.

Footnotes
PRINCESS ROSINA was allowed to gather herself three wide outside foes ahead of only the poor starter down the backstretch, was roused three wide at
the three furlong pole, making a quick move around horses in the turn, was full of run in the four path turning for home and tenaciously wore down the
frontrunner just before the wire for the win. RUTHLESS ACTION seized command from the onset, was pressed outside by a rival midway through the turn,
spurted away comfortably when coaxed at the top of the stretch but could not hold off the late rush by the winner in the last few strides. DANCING IN RIO
had a tracking role on the inside down the backstretch, was nudged on the fence, saving ground, keeping pace with the others outside throughout the turn,
rallied up the fence straightening for the drive and finished up well but could not pose a threat to the top duo in deep stretch. STORMY RALEIGH broke in at
the start, stalked on the rail in the third flight in the beginning, burst between runners to have a better position going into the turn, was shuffled back to near
the rear behind runners at the top of the stretch and re-rallied when shifting out to the three path at the furlong pole to get up for a small piece of the prize.
SUPER SHAMAN tracked outside in the beginning, moved in to prompt the pace by the half, pressed the issue under a ride through the turn, was no match
for the frontrunner who opened up straightening for home and faded between foes in the final sixteenth. SWEET PASSIONS was checked after the break to
trail the field by many along the backside, finally caught up to rivals when urged four wide outside at the quarter pole, angled out widest in the six path in the
stretch drive but was one paced to the wire.

Footnotes
CLASSY PARTNER was up close stalking then pressing the pacesetter from outside two to three wide, edged closer willingly on the turn, bid at the quarter
pole taking a narrow lead, was headed by an outside rival near the eighth pole, dug in gamely to surge inside nearing the wire. COFFEE CRISP was taken
back off the pace tracking the leaders inside, angled out passing the quarter pole, was six wide at the top of the stretch with aim, struck a narrow advantage
near the eighth pole, was outfinished while all out late. HALEY'S HONOR set the pace facing pressure, moved just clear up the backstretch then was
challenged by the eventual winner, fought on but could not match strides with the top pair but held show. ENDURING was close up stalking from outside,
raced three to five wide throughout, kept on but missed show honors. CANVAS bumped with a rival at the start, made a moderate early advance outside
four to five wide, could not sustain the effort. LILLZ STAR broke just a half-step slowly, raced inside, was never a threat. LASTMAMBO IN PARIS
exchanged a bump at the start, was outpaced early, ridden along near the five-sixteenths but had no response.

Footnotes
WICKED MERCURY travelled on the rail in mid-pack, had to patiently wait behind challengers on the rail to trail at the three furlong pole, shifted outside to
unleash a run at the quarter marker, was full of run in the six path having a clear lane in the stretch and got up a few jumps before the line for the win.
SOCIETY'S KAT stalked four deep outside near the back of the pack along the backside, made a strong move, circling around runners three wide midway
through the turn, posed a threat five wide at the top of the stretch, briefly had control between rivals at the sixteenth pole but could not fend off the winner in
deep stretch. CHROMEPLATED HEART tracked the duo outside at the half, closed the gap on the pacesetter around the bend, bid for the lead in the four
path straightening for home and ran on determinedly to the wire to be a clear third. SOUPER PECAN trailed on the fence after the start, was roused in the
three path between horses with five sixteenths to go, began to pick up the bit by the quarter pole to be in range behind foes at the top of the stretch and ran
on willingly to the wire to be a fringe player in the end. STOLEN was brushed inside at the start, settled just outside in midfield along the backside, edged
closer to the leader while in the third flight in the turn and ran on mildly in the stretch drive. FOOLISH GAMES was brushed on the outside to begin, tracked
the front pair while inside a rival at the half, lost positions going the wrong way throughout the turn and finished up gradually between foes to be involved in
a photo for a minor placing. RULE THE WAVES prompted the pace outside at the start, took over up front outside at the half, opened up in midturn setting a
brisk pace, was clinging onto the lead inside runners with a furlong to go but wilted in the final seventy yards. SOUPER SUNDAY broke sharp to have
control in the beginning, relinquished the lead at the half, chased the pacesetter through the turn, had no more to offer on the fence turning for home and
stopped inside at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
GET MY DRIFT broke outwardly tossing the head and being steadied slightly, was coaxed clear and set the pace shifting in, kicked away in the stretch
when asked and held well while being kept to the task. LADY WELLINGTON stalked from outside up the backstretch, was close coming to the quarter pole
three to four wide but proved no match for the winner while clear of the rest. I'M TENACIOUS settled at the rear, fanned seven wide turning for home,
finished with late interest. CRIMSON NIGHTS rated off the lead tracking inside, moved out off the fence on the turn, came out further in upper stretch racing
five to six wide, ran on evenly. VILLI OLENTO chased from between runners, ran on one-paced. DIAL A CLICHE was forced out at the break, made a mild
advance four to five wide, was empty in the stretch. DADDY'S DAISY was outpaced racing off the inside. TIVALI made an early advance three to four wide,
was in a bit tight between runners into and on the turn, faded.

Footnotes
LUZ DE LA LUNA was allowed to settle on the rail seeing the field down the backstretch, began to pass horses inside with three furlongs to run, shifted out,
gathering speed three wide at the quarter pole, drifted to be six wide while full of run turning for home and in a well timed late run got up for the win nearing
the wire. INDIAN MUSIC had a tracking role three deep outside down the backside, had a nice spot all alone watching the contesting pair through the turn,
began to gain steadily on the leader in mid-stretch, could not quicken with the winner who had a full head of steam with a furlong to go but ran on well to
best the rest at the finish line. CARA CARA was away alertly to be in the mix up front in the beginning, shortly after was reined in to track between runners
at the half, moved just outside to bid for the lead with three eighths remaining, edged away, taking command at the quarter pole, opened up mildly in
mid-stretch but just could not hold off the closers late and settled for third money. SIX SENSE was away a step slow to begin, stalked four deep near the
rear outside foes along the backstretch, closed in around horses four wide around the bend, was in range in the four path at the top of the lane, ran to the
wire on the left lead and could not offer a finish. HAPPY VALENTINE was situated three deep outside rivals in the middle of the pack down the backside,
made little progression running evenly between foes through the turn and was one paced in the stretch. LIFE'S JOY emerged from the lead trio to have a
clear lead on the rail by the half, was headed outside with three furlongs to go, dueled on the fence until the furlong marker, had no more in the tank at the
furlong pole and retreated to the wire. ZANA travelled in mid-pack on the rail in the early going, was scrubbed on while on the rail but offered little response
around the bend and could not get involved in the running to the wire. SACRED DANCER settled in mid-division on the rail along the backside, could not
keep up with others throughout the turn, angled out, widest in the seven path at the top of the lane and was not a factor in the running to the finish line.

Footnotes
STORMCAST was a bit hard to load, quickly moved clear, set the pace, was unasked till upper stretch, responded by extending the margin. HURRICANE
CLAIR veered out at the start, stalked from outside runners three to four wide, put to urging near the five-sixteenths, was no match for the winner but clear
of the rest. DANCING DUCHESS tracked from inside foes just off the rail, kept on evenly. MY GIRL DELLA settled inside a rival at the back, moved out on
the far turn and again in upper stretch, ran on to improve position. ONTARIO had bumps from both sides in the early going and forced to check from
between runners heading into the first turn, moved out and up outside foes three to four wide. LUNCH WITH BERNIE stalked from between runners two to
three wide early, steadily dropped back a bit, ran on one-paced thereafter. KIN'S CONCERTO was in a bit tight heading into the first turn racing four to five
wide and veering in and out just a bit, moved a bit nearer three wide on the far turn, failed to rally in the stretch. A LITTLE FRISKY exchanged some contact
early racing two wide between foes into the first turn, mover nearer the rail racing about mid-pack into the far turn, checked coming to the top of the stretch,
faded. LOOKIN TO CONQUER exchanged bumps and was forced in heading to the first turn, was always back and outrun.

unhurried trailing the field down the backside, began to go past runners three wide with three eighths from the line, angled to the six path for the drive,
continued a good sustained run in the stretch and moved in late to capture the runners up share. FIVE TOWNS (GB) settled outside rivals near the back of
the pack, stalked in the third tier three wide through the turn while keeping pace with others, started to extend her stride five wide straightening out for home,
ran on gamely trying to reel in the winner at the furlong marker and faded a touch late to lose second money in deep stretch. FASHIONABLY FAB ran
between horses in mid-division down the back straight, was in the third flight between foes through the turn, rallied three wide around rivals at the three
furlong pole, had no room behind challengers in upper stretch, shifted inwards to the two path by the quarter pole and finished with intent to win the battle
late for a minor role. FOREVER AFTER ALL was on the rail in the middle of the pack along the backside, took closer order to track the frontrunner on the
fence at the half, had a chance for a share of the prize while on the rail at the top of the stretch, dueled for a minor share inside but lost the nod at the wire.
ELYSIAN FIELD was content to sit just outside off the leader down the backstretch, tracked between foes with a half remaining, chased in the three path
with runners on both sides in upper stretch, had little left by mid-stretch and gave way. FOREVER DIXIE was ahead of one runner while settling on the rail
along the backside, saved ground but made little impression on the fence through the turn, could see the field straightening out for the drive and did not offer
a rally down the lane. STAR FORTRESS (IRE) travelled in midfield three deep outside rivals, closed in to track three wide by the half, was in the hunt
battling for the place share while in the four path at the top of the stretch, could not go on with others and emptied out with three sixteenths from the wire.

Footnotes
KITTY'SSPEEDYSTARR seized command from the start, angled inside by mid-stretch, continued to freewheel up front through the turn, increased the lead
turning for home and had no challengers in sight in the final furlong. LINDA'S OPAL was part of the quartet tracking the lead pair while in the three path with
runners on either side at the half, patiently watched the front three while moving well through the turn, angled out to be three wide at the top of the stretch in
the hunt for a share turning for home, dug in stubbornly late to close in and win the place award at the finish line. WHISKEY N ICE pressed the issue inside
the front runner in the early going, was taken a hold off while on the rail entering the turn, sat just behind the winner, waiting to move around the bend,
battled on the fence for the runners up share down the stretch and just saved the show money in a tight photo at the wire. CLOUD RIDER settled on the rail
close to the back of the pack in the early stages, was on hold behind runners on the fence throughout the turn, finally found a seam in the four path with a
sixteenth to go and with a rush, surged in deep stretch just missing to show award at the finish. PRETTY GOOD JOKE broke out on the start, tracked three
deep outside foes at the half, moved closer chasing the frontrunning winner around the bend, battled for the secondary share in the two path in upper
stretch, could not find more late and faded in the final seventy yards. GOLDEN BOSS was nestled on the fence tracking the lead pair down the backside,
had to steady sharply when rivals came over in mid-backstretch, regrouped to commence a rally three wide with five sixteenths left to run, posed a threat in
the four path at the top of the lane but stalled in the final furlong. FIRECRACKER FIONA was away slowly to begin to have only the other poor starter
beaten along the backside, made an early move three wide outside foes at the half, closed the gap travelling three wide outside rivals until the quarter pole
and levelled off running through the stretch. FEDOROVA was in the two path between rivals in the tracking foursome down the backstretch, encountered
tight quarters nearing the half mile marker and was shuffled back a few positions, made little impact on the fence through the turn, shifted out in the five path
for the stretch run and finished up mildly to the wire. TRUSTMYDADDYISSUES was checked at the start to trail the field down the back straight, was urged
throughout the turn to finally catch up to rivals four wide by the quarter pole, swung out in the seven path at the top of the lane but made little presence
running to the finish line. BEAUMONT DRIVE stalked near the rear on the outside in the early going, could not improve around the bend when roused and
had nothing to show for in the stretch drive. STWEARDS INQUIRY DOWN THE BACKSTRETCH RESULTED IN #7 WHISKEY N ICE BEING
DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED 8TH FOR INTERFERENCE
