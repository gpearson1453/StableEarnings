Footnotes
MIACOMET vied for the lead with a pair of outer rivals into and around the turn, battled with his most immediate counterpart through midstretch and inched
an advantage in the final furlong. JUSTIFREAK vied for the lead two wide and between horses, sparred with his inner competitor through the lane, but was
fended off late. HAILSTORM was a step slow to go, laid off of the pace along the inside, took the bend in the two path, then stayed on mildly to edge show
from an outer drifting rival in the final sixteenth. HARRODSBURG pressed outside of the top pair, bid and vied three deep around the turn, but gave way to
his inner counterparts entering the lane, drifted out and lost show to an inner rival in the late stages. PENSACOLA pursued two wide, chased in the three
path around the turn and failed to factor.

ATLANTIC DANCER laid off of the pace two wide, gained shifting out turning for home, bid six wide and outside of rivals at the quarter pole, swept past
entering the lane and drew off. SOUL SNATCHER bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked closest to the clear early leader and from the two path, bid two
wide along with an outer rival at three furlong pole, vied turning for home, but offered little resistance to a wide challenge entering the lane, yet kept on to
secure place. PHENOMENAL DREAM was briefly hesitant to load, pursued from midpack in the five to four path into the turn, got brushed back five wide
while closing in on the leaders at the five sixteenths pole, bid shortly after, but was outkicked by an outer bidder entering the lane, ran on mildly and edged
show. LORD DIAMOND tracked four to three wide into the turn, brushed his way back four wide at the five sixteenths pole to offer a bid between horses
shortly after, but was outkicked by a wider challenger nearing the lane and gave way. EARLY MUNNY bobbled and bumped an outer rival at the start, laid
off of the pace along the inside, saw his rider lose his crop while trying a right handed strike nearing the five sixteenths pole. KALL KARL stalked in the three
path, bid three deep at the three furlong pole, vied among foes turning for home, but faded while hanging on his left lead. HEZMORETHANREADY was
bumped between rivals and took back at the start, trailed along while detached from the rest around the turn and made little impact. ACE THE RACE sped
clear early on, but was headed by a pair of outer bidders at the three furlong pole and faltered.

SOMETHINABOUTHER tracked three wide, ranged up four wide around the far turn to bid at the quarter pole, forged an advantage in the six path in upper
stretch, dug in to meet an outer rival's challenge leaving the furlong grounds, drifted out while clinging to a margin in the final sixteenth and gamely held.
JEWELED CITY broke a beat slow, recovered to track from midpack along the inside, moved to the two path into the backstretch, crept closer in the three to
four path around the far turn before swinging five wide into the lane, took aim in the seven path and outside of the new leader in upper stretch, bid leaving
the furlong grounds, but was herded outwardly by that foe in the final sixteenth and was kept at bay. ALONGCOMESAWOMAN tracked along the inside,
steadied behind rivals approaching the backstretch, awaited racing room whlie blocked around the far turn, split foes two wide in upper stretch, rallied to
offer a rail bid with a sixteenth to go, but needed more. GROVE CITY SUNSET broke a step slow, tracked two wide and between horses, entered the lane in
the five path, ran on late and attempted a bid for show. ALWAYS PRACTICAL prompted two wide, vied around the far turn, then between horses at the
quarter pole, got headed by an outer rival in upper stretch and yielded between horse. TAKE NOTE OF THIS stalked along the inside, awaited racing room
while pursuing from the pocket around the far turn, came under a drive in the three path at the quarter pole and lacked a kick. CAT PAYS THE TOLL stalked
two wide, then outside of the top pair around the far turn, bid along with an outer rival at the quarter pole, chased among foes in upper stretch and gave way.
SHEILA'S LION broke a step slow and failed to factor. SWEET STAR hesitated at the start, trailed along the inside, improved three wide entering upper
stretch and made little impact. POWERWASHED showed the way inside of a prompting foe, got headed by a trio of foes at the quarter pole and weakened.
BERRIES AND CREAM laid off of the pace in the two path and tired. AMY'S LAW broke inwardly and dropped back at the start, then got outrun in the two to

Footnotes
COOL RAGS took back subtly between horses with seven furlongs to go, got shuffled back behind a faltering foe at the seven sixteenths pole, altered two
wide shortly to regain stride shortly after, shifted out to the five to six path into upper stretch, rallied to bid outside of the leaders at the sixteenth pole and
drove past. STAR NATION broke a step slow while last away, lagged behind the rest into the far turn, cut the gap and rejoined the field entering the lane,
rallied with a good rail kick in midstretch, was blocked behind a rival entering the final sixteenth, slipped through a narrow seam to sustain progress in the
late stages and belatedly gained place. HOME RUN TRICK vied two wide, led turning for home, dueled shifting out to the four path entering the final furlong,
but was caught by an outer bidder passing the sixteenth pole, lost place to an inner rival late and kept on between horses. VERSATILE laid off of the pace
two wide, advanced between horses turning for home, chased behind the leaders in upper stretch, took aim inside of them in the final furlong, but lacked a
kick to make a bid. MR. PETERKIN stalked outside of the top pair, chased them from the three path around the far turn, crept closer in the five path along
with an outer rival in the final furlong, attempted a bid at the sixteenth pole but flattened out late. PLATINUM GHOST vied for the lead with an outer rival,
dueled after getting headed turning for home, moved out to the three path in midstretch and yielded between horses. LEGENDARY LORE laid off of the
pace three wide, came under urging in the four path around the turn, floated to the six to seven path into upper stretch and failed to menace. READY
PURSUIT tracked along the inside, but faded into the far turn and was done early.

Footnotes
UPPER CASE stalked in the three path, pressed the leader turning for home, assumed command while well in hand entering the lane, then kicked away
with a strong finish under vigorous hand urging. ALWAYS ANGELS laid off of the pace two wide and between horses into the turn, pursued from the three
path turning for home, shifted inwardly entering the lane and offered a rail rally to gain place at the sixteenth pole. PROUD FOOT laid off of the pace three
wide and between horses, gained ground in the four path along with an outer rival around the bend to be within striking range at the quarter pole, but failed
to keep pace with the clearing leader in upper stretch, vied for place into the final furlong but was outkicked by an inner foe at the sixteenth pole. CONNIE K
leaned out and bumped a rival at the start, prompted inside of the leader early on, stalked that one around the turn, chased shifting out to the three path in
upper stretch and lacked a bid. TX WOMEN FOR ARTS chased forwardly in the two path, then between horses turning for home, shfited out to the three to
four path in upper stretch and failed to threaten. TIFFANY TWIST took contact from an inner rival at the start, saved ground at the rear, fanned out to the
seven path in upper stretch and improved position. QUICK MUNNY showed the way two wide, proved no match for an outer bidder entering the lane and
weakened between horses. WUPKAR lunged slightly at the start and was last away, laid off of the pace four wide, gained in the five path along with an inner
rival around the turn to be within striking range nearing the lane, but stalled out and weakened.

CHATTANOOGA CREW set the pace inside of a prompting rival, vied with that one around the turn, shook free in upper stretch and drew off under light
urging. BLUE DAZZLER prompted outside of the eventual winner, vied with that one around the turn, failed to sustain the battle in upper stretch then held
place late. WELL AWARE stalked outside of the top pair, but only managed to chase them in upper stretch, kept on late and was denied place. ON THE
MOVE broke a step slow while last away, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out four wide into the turn, inched closer around the bend, but stalled
out with a quarter mile to go and tired. PARISIAN LIGHT was off a beat slow, tracked along the inside chased around the turn and gave way. KATE WINS
trailed in the two to three path before fanning out to the five path nearing the lane, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
CHARCOAL pursued from midpack in the three path, ranged up turning for home to take aim on the new leader from the four path entering the lane, but
was herded outwardly multiple paths by that one while pursuing through midstretch, sustained his bid to vie in the closing stages and prevailed. ARREST
ME RED laid off of the pace along the inside, shouldered an outer rival while moving to the three path around the turn, brushed that foe again while shifting
to the seven entering the lane, tipped inwardly to counter the leaders' drift in midstretch, rallied to bid inside of them in the final sixteenth but missed at the
wire. MO STASH took contact from an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace while getting brushed to the four path around the turn, got floated to the
eight path while still taking contact from his inner counterpart entering the lane, shifted out while closing in on the drifting leaders in the final furlong, offered
a late kick to threaten in the closing stages, but was too late and dead-heated for show. COPPOLA prompted two wide, vied turning for home, led narrowly
entering the lane in the three path, drifted out while holding sway from an outer pursuer through midstretch, but was caught by that one and an inner bidder
in the closing stages, then dead-heated for show at the wire. MIDNIGHT TAXES pursued from midpack along the inside, chased in the three path in upper
stretch and moved up late. OUTADORE led from an outer prompter, got headed entering the lane and faded. JOE SHIESTY bumped an inner rival at the
start, stalked along the inside, searched for racing room off of the rail nearing the lane, shifted back in to commit to a rail charge in upper stretch, but tired.
SPANKSTER bounced off an outer rival and into an inner foe at the start, was slow to recover and lagged behind the rest into the turn, then cut the gap late.

Footnotes
WALKATHON stalked close up two wide and between horses, took aim outside of the top pair and form the four path nearing the lane, pursued and bid
leaving the furlong grounds, sparred in the final sixteenth and wrestled an advantage late. DANA'S BEAUTY pressed outside of the leader and from the
three path, vied around the far turn, forged an advantage in upper stretch, dug in to resist an outer challenge leaving the furlong grounds, dueled gamely
with that one late but was bested. SHE'S LOOKIN LUCKY broke through the gate pre-race before being reloaded following a veterinarian exam, set the
pace in the two path as an outer rival applied pressure, vied with that one around the far turn, got headed in upper stretch, fought on doggedly after losing
place at the furlong grounds and remained clear of the rest. NEVERWALKALONE (BRZ) saved ground pursuing from midpack, slipped inside of rivals to
gain fourth at the sixteenth pole and fended off an outer foe. SAFEEN was last away, pursued from midpack hung four wide, inched closer in the five path
around the far turn, vied for fourth in midstretch but hung on her left lead and was denied by an inner rival. GET TWISTED pursued from midpack three wide
and between horses, yielded around the far turn to trail nearing the lane, shifted in entering it and improved inside of rivals. BOLIVIE (IRE) settled off of the
pace in the two path, shifted out to the five path turning for home, improved past inner rivals entering the lane in the six path and failed to menace. REGAL
REALM stalked along the inside, chased in the two path entering the lane and faded between horses. JILL JITTERBUG pursued two wide and between
horses, encountered traffic entering the lane and tired. EXCELLENT QUESTION raced at the rear in the three to four path and failed to factor.

Footnotes
WAVES OF MISCHIEF stalked along the inside, moved outside of the top pair and to the four path entering the backstretch, stalked the loose leader from
the three path around the far turn, tucked briefly entering the lane before taking aim outside of that one in upper stretch, sustained grinding progress to offer
a bid in the final sixteenth and reeled in the leader at the wire. PIN UP BETTY prompted two wide, led leaving the three quarter pole, built a loose advantage
entering the far turn, held sway through midstretch, but tired and drifted out in the final sixteenth as an outer bidder closed in and got nailed at the wire.
KALISPERA (IRE) laid off of the pace along the inside, pursued form the three path around the far turn before swinging five wide entering the lane, rallied to
close in on the top pair in the final furlong but needed more. MO FOX GIVIN pursued from midpack along the inside, awaited racing room behind rivals while
taking the far turn in the two path, split rivals two wide leaving the furlong grounds and ran on willingly. MONT SAINT MICHEL (FR) tracked two to three
wide early on, chased between horses around the far turn and yielded. EVERLAND saved ground at the rear, encountered traffic entering the lane in the
three path, altered six wide at the furlong grounds and failed to menace. SHE'S FIRE set the pace along the inside early on, relinquished the lead to an
outer rival with three furlongs to go, chased into and around the far turn, then faded. SANCTIFY fidgeted and broke a step slow, raced at the rear two wide,
shifted out to the five path around the far turn before getting floated to the seven path entering the lane and failed to factor. ADRASTEIA pursued two to four
wide and tired between horses.

Footnotes
HIGHWAY ROBBER laid off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide and between horses at the five furlong pole, gained approaching the far turn to bid
outside of the top air and from the four path with three furlongs to go, led turning for home, dueled with an inner bidder entering the lane and fended that one
off thereafter. SIEGE OF BOSTON tracked along the inside, bid inside of the new leader entering the lane, dueled through midstretch but was staved off.
ANGLOPHILE pursued from midpack two wide, then in the five path and among foes around the far turn, tipped to the seven path nearing the final furlong
and rallied to gain show at the wire. KING CURLIN saved ground off of the pace, stayed on to gain show in the closing stages but got nailed at the wire.
UNCLE JAKE set the pace in the three path, vied with an outer rival and in the two path down the backstretch, got headed by a wider bidder around the far
turn, yielded to that one and an inner challenge in upper stretch, then lost show to bidders on either side late. CLYDE'S GOT A GUN lacked speed along the
inside, advanced six wide around the far turn, vied for minor placings in midstretch but leveled off between horses. GUNTOWN trailed two wide, got hung
seven wide around the far turn, then improved position. CAMP HOPE tracked three wide, pursued from the four path and among foes around the far turn,
then gave way. WHAT SAY THEE raced forwardly two wide and between horses but yeilded around the far turn. LAST SAMURAI laid off of the pace three
wide, five wide at the five furlong pole, gained into the far turn to be within striking range turning for home, but tired between horses in upper stretch.
CLASSIC CAUSEWAY stalked in the four path, vied outside of the leader and from the three path down the backstretch, but weakened between horses
nearing the lane.
