Footnotes
ANN ALEE saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and drew off in the lane. DIRT
FLIRT raced in the two path around the first bend, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the
two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position in the lane while proving to be no match for the winner. MIZ CALI bumped with the
horse to her inside at the start, raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the
second bend and chased on to the wire. JEWEL AZUL bumped with the horse to her inside and was squeezed back leaving the gate, raced in the two path
around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, navigated the second bend from the three path and never threatened. OCTANE
(BRZ) raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leader between horses up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path
and weakened from there. BETYAR AZETS raced in the two path early, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far
bend and faded in the lane. WILLOWMYGIRL saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the
far bend and was never a factor.
