Footnotes
MY BUDDY FRANK took the lead and moved to the inside to show the way, kept the edge over the challenge of FUJI FIRE leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, drew off under mild hand urging on the far turn and was kept in hand through the lane. The latter stalked off the rail, challenged at the seven sixteenths
pole but dropped back at the rail on the far turn and proved no match. TIZAWINNER rounded the first turn about the four path, left the turn outside and
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, ran in the four path on the far turn and finished evenly. SO SMOOTH came away a bit awkwardly and
settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little in the lane.
SENSUAL CHOCOLATE rated close inside on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn.
MOUSE TO MOUSE became fractious in the gate and mostly saved ground.

GOLDEN ASSET contested at near even terms through the backstretch, raced two abreast through the turn and took the nod into the lane, dug in under
steady insistence and drew off later yards. MIC'D UP veered out and made contact with SHOW TIME ALLEN leaving the gate then dueled for the nod
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and set the pace from that point, raced at even terms nearest the rail on the turn, was met entering the stretch and
relented inside the sixteenth pole. The latter was shut off and bumped leaving the gate, jostled with PARK AVE PRINCE at about the same time then gave
chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail and flattened in the lane. PARK AVE PRINCE exchanged contact with Seattle Prince and was jostled leaving the
gate, gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail into the turn, drifted entering the stretch and flattened stride. EL PACHO gave chase, raced in
the four path on the turn, was carried out entering the stretch and weakened. SEATTLE PRINCE exchanged contact with Park Ave Prince leaving the gate,
gave chase and raced in the five path on the turn. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Mic'd Up for interference on the
chute, lodged by the rider of Show Time Allen.

Footnotes
ALPINE MOON settled back toward mid track, started her bid into the turn and raced at the rail through the turn, eased out past the eighth pole and dug in
to take over the final yards. CRAFTY WINDSOR CAT rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, rounded the turn at the rail,
drifted a path entering the stretch, lugged in under right hand urging mid-stretch and was caught in the final yards. CHEROKEE CASTLE chased inside and
raced at the rail on the turn, was shut off mid-stretch but came back to finish evenly. MISS BEE BOP chased outside through the backstretch, raced in the
five path on the turn and passed rivals in the lane. FULL MOON LOVER broke through the gate prior the start then stalked then gave chase nearing the five
sixteenths pole, raced close in the three path on the turn but weakened toward mid-stretch. GHOSTLY SQUALL chased, rounded the turn about the four
path and showed little more. MANAROLA gave chase then weakened off the rail on the turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of
Crafty Windsor Cat for interference mid-stretch, lodged by the rider of Cherokee Castle, which resulted in the disqualification of Crafty Windsor to third
place.
