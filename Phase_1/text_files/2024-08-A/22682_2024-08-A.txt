Footnotes
PIONEER PRINCE stepped to the front and showed the way clear to the far turn, challenged by ZIO JO late on the bend, lost command at the eighth pole,
fought back to regain the advantage and held over the late charge from LAHAINA FLAVOR at the wire. LAHAINA FLAVOR dropped back early and moved
inside, passed a rival continuing to save ground on the far turn, steered out at the top of the lane, closed fast outside the top pair in the final moments and
narrowly missed. ZIO JO stalked the speed from the fence, tipped to the two path around the far turn and challenged late on the bend, put a head in front
with a furlong remaining, dueled outside PIONEER PRINCE into the late stages, relinquished the lead back to that rival and got edged for second. UNCLE
REG settled in the early going along the inside, crept closer up the backstretch, roused while tipping out approaching the stretch, chased within striking
distance down the lane but could not produce a bid. NEON LIGHTS (IRE) raced up close from outside then in the two path on the clubhouse turn, lost
ground on the backstretch, dropped to last on the second turn, tired and eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
LOVE OUR FAMILY grabbed the early lead and was taken over to the rail, maintained an uncontested lead to the far turn, opened up around the bend and
was ridden out to the wire. SMILE BABY SMILE stumbled leaving the gate, forwardly placed three deep into the first turn then moved into the two path, was
closest in pursuit to the far turn, lost ground to the winner around the bend, stayed on through the lane and whittle the gap late while clearly second best.
AMELIA BLEU chased keenly off the rail into the first turn, traveled three deep up the backstretch, ridden along three then four wide on the second bend
and gained third. NORAH'S PRINCESS climbed early then pulled on the first turn, went between rivals into the backstretch, rounded the far turn two then
three wide and flattened out. SPREAD THE RISK broke a step slow, trailed four wide into the first turn then angled inward, passed a rival early on the far
turn, came four wide into the lane and passed a few more tired rivals to improve position. BEAUTIFUL JANET took up when racing on heels early on the
clubhouse turn, chased inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch, saved ground then entered the lane a bit off the rail and had little left for the drive. ILA
VEIW TOO chased four deep then became rank and dropped back on the first turn while moving inward, saved ground through the far turn from the fence
while starting to weaken, tired in the lane and was eased and walked off. HALF NELSON chased five deep then four wide early, raced in the second flight in
the middle stages, dropped back to last early on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
PACE LANE sprinted clear and showed the way from the rail, set all the pace to the stretch, roused at the top of the lane, asked right handed past the eighth
pole, tested by SATELLITE HEART late and managed to hold on. SATELLITE HEART was a bit rank when stalking in hand along the rail, had to take hold
when boxed in behind the leader early on the far turn, ridden along at the quarter pole, tipped out in upper stretch, drew alongside PACE LANE in the final
sixteenth and just missed. HIGHLANDS broke a step slow, unhurried along the inside, hugged the rail to the stretch, moved out in the drive and kept on for
third. PLATINUM DIVA tracked three deep then outside a rival into the backstretch, traveled between runners into the far turn and continued in the two path
to the stretch, then weakened when called upon. BRAND NEW DREAM tracked between foes then outside a rival around the clubhouse turn, moved out
and traveled three deep at the midway point, chased three then four wide on the far turn and also weakened. MADISON RAE stalked close up in the two
path, asked around the far turn, spun three wide into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
JUST TRUST ME forwardly placed from outside, chased three then four wide around the turn, followed in range through the final furlong, came with a late
bid and got up at the wire. WHISKEYINATEACUP traveled in mid-pack outside a rival into the turn, eased out and raced four wide into the lane, finished
with a late rush and got up for second. MR. MACHUPICCHU bobbled leaving the gate, went up to press the pace from outside, headed the leader nearing
the five-sixteenths pole, dueled from the three path entering the drive, took over past the eighth pole, maintained a short advantage into the final moments
but got nailed by the top pair in the shadow of the wire. UNSUSTAINABLE set the pace under pressure from MR. MACHUPICCHU to the turn, fought on
even terms past the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage inside the eighth pole, stayed on gamely from the rail and was outfinished by the top trio.
BETHEGUYNOTTHATGUY chased off the rail then dropped back when climbing along early, went three deep into the turn, angled to the inside past the
quarter pole and could not rally. IT'S THIRSTY TIME settled outside rivals in the early going, traveled four deep at the three-eighths pole, spun three wide
into the lane, angled out in upper stretch, drifted inward past the eighth pole and lacked the needed response. KANGAROO COAST got bumped on both
sides leaving the gate, was ridden along while climbing, chased between foes then a bit off the rail into the lane and prove no menace.
SHANKADOPOLOUS broke in and bumped KANGAROO COAST, climbed early and trailed up the backstretch, continued at the back through the turn and
passed a tired rival. GLORIOUS OSCAR bumped leaving the gate, chased from inside, lost ground into the turn, got put in a bit tight past the five-sixteenths
pole but was already starting to weaken and dropped back, tired and eased in the lane and walked off.

DISKO TRIBUTE broke well then took a stalking position on the rail inside a pair of rivals, saved ground through the turn, launched a rail bid at the top of the
lane, took over past the eighth pole and kicked clear in deep stretch under urging. LEMON SUSHI forwardly placed three deep, got floated out and bumped
near the five-sixteenths pole, came three wide into the stretch, finished willingly and outkicked TIZZ A GOOD THING for second. TIZZ A GOOD THING
settled off the pace and moved inside, cut the corner into the stretch, put to left handed urging shortly after and got outclosed for the place honors. BEER
MONEY unhurried early on, trailed a bit off the rail into the turn, coaxed along but lacked room in traffic behind rivals around the bend, tipped out for a clear
path entering the lane and produced a mild rally. STRAIGHT LUCK showed keen early foot setting the pace up the backstretch, led along the rail then two
wide into the drive, asked right handed at the top of the lane and was soon confronted by the winner, clung to a narrow lead at the eighth pole, yielded
shortly after and weakened in the late stages. CHROMEFLASH stalked outside a rival then between foes into the turn, drifted out and bumped rival near the
five-sixteenths pole, moved back to the two path and could not respond when asked. REFOCUS traveled three deep at the back, took the turn three then
two wide, steered out wide in upper stretch and was never a factor. KNOWN IDEA settled two wide early, asked in the two then three path around the bend,
moved out in the lane and failed to threaten.

HERE COMES BRAYLON dueled for the lead from outside up the backstretch, inched ahead between rivals on the turn, dueled inside BARTHOLDY while
in three path entering the lane, lost command in upper stretch, battle back from inside and regained the lead inside the sixteenth pole, drifted out and
brushed with BARTHOLDY late and gamely prevailed. BARTHOLDY stalked the top pair from outside up the backstretch, bid three deep on the turn, fought
outside HERE COMES BRAYLON into the stretch from the four path, took over in upper stretch, battled in the final furlong with inner rival, brushed late and
just missed. RUSSELLS HUSTLE got crowded and bumped early then climbed a bit up the backstretch, angled to the inside, split foes at the five-sixteenths
pole, moved out in the lane and rallied for the show honors. WINEMAKER off slow from inside then started to climb and dropped back far back, raced near
the inside then angled out at the quarter pole and summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. BROADWAY UNIONS raced in range outside rival,
raced in the four path turning for home and lacked a rally. CAPTAIN SPARROW dueled from inside to the turn, asked while vying inside a pair of rivals
around the bend, chased outer pair two wide into the lane and weakened. BOWTIE BOYS climbed early chasing off the pace, lost ground through the turn
and angled out to race seven wide into the lane, then passed tired rivals in the stretch run. BATTLE CRUISER got crowded and bumped early, chased off
the rail, four deep at the five-sixteenths pole, exited the bend five wide and failed to menace. MONGOLIAN CHAMP chased from inside, weakened around
the turn and tired in the stretch run. FAST CHAZ forwardly placed early then started to climb when losing a clear path, chased off the inside into the turn,
dropped back and drifted six wide on the turn, then faded in the lane. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING HERE COMES BRAYLON AND
BARTHOLDY IN DEEP STRETCH AND FOLLOWING A REVIEW RULED THAT THE CONTACT WAS MUTUEL BETWEEN THE RUNNERS AND NO
CHANGE WOULD BE MADE.

Footnotes
ANDIAMO RAGAZZA broke a step slow, trailed on the inside, raced in hand two wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, surged late and nailed LONG
MAYSHE REIGN at the wire. LONG MAYSHE REIGN coaxed clear early, showed the way along the rail then a bit off the rail into the drive, remained clear
under urging into the final sixteenth and got nailed on the line. DIAMOND BAR GAL got knocked into rival shortly after the start, stalked three wide, drifted in
and steadied briefly in upper stretch, finished willingly for the show honors, then pulled up following the race on the backstretch and was transported off the
track via equine ambulance. BOLD CHOICE came in and bumped DIAMOND BAR GAL early, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch and around the turn,
took aim two wide into the lane and could not summon the needed late kick. DORIE MILLER raced two wide off the pace, between rivals on the turn, angled
inward in deep stretch and failed to rally. GIANT KID sat off the pace on the inside, was forced to wait when boxed in along the fence on the turn and lacked
room behind a rival into the stretch, moved out in the lane and kept trying but failed to threaten. IRISH WAHINE got bumped from outside early, sat off the
pace three deep, remained three wide to the stretch and was never a factor. CLUBHOUSE BRIDE stalked the pace from inside, coaxed along around the
bend and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
TRIPLE PASS stalked from inside, crept closer in the middle stages, waited patiently behind a wall off rivals on the far turn while easing off the rail, given his
cue while angling out into the stretch, bid five deep approaching the eighth pole, fought three deep in the last sixteenth and dug in to prove best. SUPREME
COAST fractious in the gate, stalked two wide in hand, tipped three wide past the three-eighths pole, challenged four deep a quarter mile out, took over at
the top of the lane, vied between foes in the final furlong, drifted out and bumped late while finishing gamely but was overtaken by the winner. CLASSIC
ALPHIE raced up close four deep into the first turn, vied four deep up the backstretch, three deep approaching the five-sixteenths pole, battled between into
the lane, fought inside a pair of rivals into deep stretch, drifted and made contact with SUPREME COAST late and got outkicked in the end. EDDIE'S WAVE
bumped with outer rival in the beginning, dueled two wide early, held a short lead vying between rivals up the backstretch and far turn, lost command at the
top of the stretch and faltered in the final sixteenth. FLYING BLIND fought for the early lead from inside, vied inside rivals up the backstretch and far turn,
stayed on to upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. WINSITWELL took up early when a rival crossed in front, trailed six wide into the
clubhouse turn then passed a rival while in the seven path around the bend, moved up while pulling early on the backstretch, raced up close five deep to the
far turn, chased seven wide into the lane and faded. R AWESOME KID checked shortly after the start between rivals, went five wide into the first turn racing
near the back, trailed leaving the clubhouse turn, passed a rival with three furlongs remaining, went four then five wide on the second bend and could not
make an impact. SPOT D' ORO broke well then was taken off the pace, pulled in the three path around the first turn, dropped back to last and moved inside
in the middle stages, saved ground around the far turn and tired. KISSMEYOUFOOL bumped with inner rival leaving the gate, prompted the pace three
deep early, moved up to fight for the lead on the backstretch, coaxed along past the three-eighths pole, dropped back around the bend, spun three wide into
the lane and came up empty.
