Footnotes
ORIGINAL forwardly placed in the early running, tracked three wide along the first turn and was well placed into the backstretch run, tracked outside of the
leading pair heading to the half-mile marker, loomed three wide into the far turn and took a narrow lead at the quarter pole, led into the stretch and was set
down at the furlong marker, dug in while kept to task into the final sixteenth and held well in deep stretch over the oncoming runner-up. WELLSWORT (IRE)
settled just off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, was well placed through the backstretch run, maintained an inside path into the far turn
and inched closer at the quarter pole, was roused two wide into the stretch, angled outside of the leading pair past the furlong marker, rallied into the final
sixteenth, could not get by the winner in deep stretch and held for second. IMPLICITLY reserved in the early going, saved ground into the first turn, was
unhurried while not far back nearing the half-mile, roused two to three wide into the far turn, gained ground into the stretch, sustained his rally into the final
sixteenth and was clear for third. WINE AND WHISKY prominent leaving the start, stalked the early pace outside of QUE SERA SIR RALPH, advanced to
prompt that rival through decent fractions heading to the half-mile, dueled the pacesetter into the far turn and took a narrow lead at the quarter pole, was
overtaken into the stretch, chased ORIGINAL into the final sixteenth and was outkicked in deep stretch. TOUCH OF ZEN settled outside of rivals in the early
stages, was unhurried through the backstretch run, mounted a three to four wide bid nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that run into the stretch
and weakened. QUE SERA SIR RALPH sent to establish the early lead, assumed command into the first turn and set a pressured pace into the backstretch,
lost the lead into the far turn and faded in the drive. CHIEF JACKSON allowed to settle while never far back, caught four then three wide into the first turn,
tracked the decent pace between runners to the half-mile, was outrun to the quarter pole and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
ARTEMUS GORDON broke well and was pushed to the lead, opened up on the field heading into the turn, then surrendered the lead to WARREN'S
WORLD who slipped inside, came back on to regain the lead passing the furlong marker and held clear in the end. WARRENS WORLD tracked behind the
lone pacesetter racing in the three path, launched a bid from the five-sixteenths pole, came three wide into the stretch and finished well under strong
handling and intermittent urging but could not reel in the winner. TOO MUCH INFO broke well, vied for the early lead through the initial furlong, was content
to sit off the pace set by ARTEMUS GORDON while keeping to the inside going into the turn, took advantage of a wide open path along the rail and took the
lead at the head of the stretch, was going well under steady handing then lost the lead to a resurgent ARTEMUS GORDON in the final furlong. BIG
DIFFERENCE lacked speed from the break then raced inside of APLOMBADO near the back of the compact field, went into a drive from the three furlong
pole and finished evenly while well behind the top three. APLOMBADO came away well then raced near the back of the pack but no more than four or five
lengths behind the leader through the early stages, had to be ridden to keep up heading into the turn, did not respond and had nothing to offer for the stretch
run.

Footnotes
ZAFFERANA rated off of the decent early pace, maintained a two wide path into the first turn and tracked the pace from the second flight heading to the
half-mile marker, was roused two then three wide into the far turn and loomed into upper stretch, took command at the furlong marker, responded to steady
urging into the final sixteenth and edged away late. OH ANGEL allowed to settle away from the start, saved ground into the first turn and was unhurried
through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn, got caught in tight into upper stretch and shifted out nearing the furlong marker, could not reel in
the winner into the final sixteenth and got up for second in the final strides. AFTER MY OWN HEART was prominent away from the start, stalked the early
pace two to three wide into the first turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run, prompted the pace outside of SMILINGATTHEMOON into
the far turn, vied for the lead between rivals into the stretch, could not match strides with ZAFFERANA into the final sixteenth, was tagged in the final strides
for second and held clearly for third. GEEJAYTEE allowed to settle in the early going, was content to trail through the backstretch run, saved ground into the
far turn, swung widest for the drive and gained ground at mid-stretch, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and flattened out.
SMILINGATTHEMOON sent to establish the early lead, set the pace a bit off of the rail into the first turn, set decent fractions into the backstretch run and
drew clear a the half-mile, showed the way into the far turn, led into the stretch, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker, was overtaken past
mid-stretch and faded in the late stages.

CLEVER CLOVER settled in last but not far behind in a very tight field, launched a bid from the five-sixteenths pole then went four wide into the stretch,
finished strong under steady handling was was up in time. RAMATHORN was quick from the gate and seized the early advantage with the rest in close
pursuit, held sway to the turn, then responded when taken on by HALO RANDO to the inside and NAFTIS to the outside, held on determinedly to the wire
but was tagged in the final jump in a superb effort. HALO RANDO settled just behind RAMATHORN while staying inside, move up to challenge from the
quarter pole, battled gamely but could not get by that one through the stretch. NAFTIS settled just behind the pacesetter two wide, bid three wide into the
stretch but had trouble changing leads and was outfinished.

WHAT A RELIEF hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set the pace the pace heading to the half-mile marker, drew clear into the turn
and set a decent pace approaching the quarter pole, drew off into the stretch, was ridden out into the final sixteenth and hand urged in deep stretch to
prevail as much the best. ONE BIG SMILE chased the early pace from between runners, ran in pursuit of the loose pacesetter while two then three wide
nearing the quarter pole, could not match strides with WHAT A RELIEF into the stretch, stayed on into the final sixteenth and won the nod for second.
TEMPTING PROSPECT broke in at the start and was away a bit slowly, tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, raced five wide into the turn
and chased to the quarter pole, maintained a wide path into the stretch, closed into the final sixteenth and just missed for second, while just getting up for
third. TOP WOLF was away in good order and vied for the lead away from the start, chased the decent early pace outside of WHAT A RELIEF, ran in
pursuit four wide into the turn and lost ground at the quarter pole, maintained an outside path into the stretch, re-rallied in the final sixteenth and just missed
for the minor awards. TRIANGLE settled off of the decent early pace while not far back, raced two to three wide along the bend, needed more into the
stretch and offered a mild late rally. HE'S TRUE BLUE tracked the decent early pace from the outside, chased six wide into the turn and lost ground at the
quarter pole, maintained an outside path into the stretch, was able to mildly re-rally into the final sixteenth but needed more in deep stretch. TIGERSUN
hustled away from the start, stalked the decent early pace from between runners, got caught in tight into the turn and was shuffled back nearing the quarter
marker, split rivals into upper stretch and ran in pursuit to the furlong marker, was able to was able to mildly re-rally into the final sixteenth but needed more
in deep stretch. GALLOPING MAJOR lacked early speed, trailed into the turn and raced three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, swung seven wide into
the stretch and did not factor in the late stages. AUTISM MIND broke in at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to be forwardly placed in the early
going, raced close up to the decent pace nearing the half-mile marker, saved ground into the turn and lost position at the quarter pole, was outrun into the
stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED RHYTHM settled just off of the early pace and went two wide into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace between runners into the
backstretch, chased three wide into the far turn and was roused at the quarter pole, mounted a four wide rally into the stretch and vied for the lead at the
furlong marker, raced on even terms with BIG BET past mid-stretch, battled that game rival into the final sixteenth, surged in the final strides and got up at
the wire for a determined win. BIG BET was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, was well
placed into the backstretch run and maintained an inside path into the far turn, tipped two wide into upper stretch and vied for the lead between foes at the
furlong pole, met the bid of UNBRIDLED RHYTHM past mid-stretch, fought gamely to the wire and just missed for the win, while just holding for second.
FAR TO LONG a step slow leaving the start, settled outside of rivals into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, chased four wide into the
far turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, sustained his bid into the drive and chased while widest at mid-stretch, closed willingly into the final
sixteenth and just missed for the win and place, while holding safely in the end for the show. SARK broke well and showed good speed without being asked,
moved over to the inside and raced in the two path through the first turn, took up a stalking position just behind BEGIN AGAIN while under some restraint,
was let loose on the far turn, loomed a big threat passing the quarter pole, came into the stretch with every chance and ran on well under steady handling
but lacked the winning punch. BEGIN AGAIN easily made the lead despite lugging in, led the field racing alone on the lead through moderate fractions down
the backstretch, was traveling well heading into the far turn then quickened away through that turn, came into the stretch with the lead, then was racing on
the wrong lead, lost momentum and faltered mid-stretch. CAUSE FOR DIVORCE took a bump from MR MAKUNOUCHI after the break, steadied to avoid
running into DRINKS AT THE CLUB then navigated a path to get to the outside all before the clubhouse turn, raced four to five wide through that turn and
emerged in the clear for the run down the backstretch, went five wide through the far turn trying to mount a rally but stalled out in upper stretch and was
outfinished. DRINKS AT THE CLUB narrowly avoided contact at the start then worked to get away from the rail and went three to four wide through the first
turn, raced up close between horses down the backstretch, started to drop out of contention heading into the far turn, came under pressure and could not
improve down the stretch. MR MAKUNOUCHI veered in at the start and made contact with CAUSE FOR DIVORCE, took a few strides for the rider to regain
control, then became rank going into the first turn, advanced into contention down the backstretch, got an inside run into the stretch, loomed a threat then
flattened out and was out finished by all but one. ALIBI TERHUNE broke with the field and was caught four wide into the first turn, dropped to last then
lagged behind the field to the far turn, did not appear to handling the surface and was never a factor at any point.
