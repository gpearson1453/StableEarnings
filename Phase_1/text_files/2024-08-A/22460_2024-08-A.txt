Footnotes
KIKITSA emerged from the lead trio to take control while in hand at the five eighths marker, opened up comfortably with no challengers in sight around the
turn and improved the margin of victory when kept to the task down the stretch. SILENT PATSY was bumped a couple of times at the break, settled outside
foes in mid-pack down the backside, improved outside when scrubbed on three wide midway around the bend, shifted outside runners in the four path for
the stretch run and closed in smartly late to get up for the runners up share. MISS WATERLOO travelled on the rail in midfield, edged closer up the fence
with five sixteenths to run, was the only one with a chance to catch the frontrunner winner in upper stretch, chased to no avail in mid-stretch and lost the
place share a few jumps before the wire. STORMY OCEAN stalked in the third flight on the rail, improved on the fence by the half, chased the winner but to
no avail around the bend and between horses in the three path finished up evenly to the wire. ZIBIBBO co-trailed on the inside in mid-backstretch, shifted
out, three wide by the half, offered a mild run four wide at the quarter pole, shifted inwards with a furlong to go and ran on willingly while on the fence to the
finish line. OLIVIA'S MELODY broke out on the start, watched the pacesetter while inside another foe along the backside, could not go on with others on
both sides by the quarter pole and failed to menace down the lane. L'ESPRIT was off a step slow to begin, co-trailed on the outside five furlongs from home
going four deep, made no impacted when roused four wide around the turn and passed a straggler in the stretch running inside. IRON PYRITE broke sharp,
chased three wide outside horses down the backside, was urged for more three wide midturn, had nothing to offer and backed away between rivals at the
quarter pole.

Footnotes
QUIET VISTA had a slim advantage with rivals on either side down the backstretch, dueled on the rail through the turn, began to edge clear in upper stretch
up top, was let out another notch with a furlong remaining and won comfortably when crossing the finish line. PARADISE PERFECT had a stalking position
on the rail in the third flight, took closer order between horses three furlongs from the line, shifted out from behind the winner to be in three path, full of run
with three sixteenths to go and kept trying to the finish, besting the rest for second money. MUCHO MAGNIFICO was bumped inside to begin, trailed the
field with three quarters to run, could still see the pack when commencing a run three furlongs out, shifted out seven wide for a clear lane down the stretch
and passed foes smartly to get up late for the show award. DEMBA pressed the issue inside in the beginning, kept pace while on the fence in mid-division
through the turn, improved up the fence to be in the thick of things by the quarter pole but levelled off the last sixteenth to settle on the fringes in the end.
WHISKEY ROW was in a good position early on, sitting just behind the engaged trio, took closer order while under a snug hold to track outside around the
bend, loomed a threat four wide at the quarter pole but stalled with a furlong to go. THEFRONTIERSMAN travelled three wide outside foes in the third tier
along the backstretch, was moving well four wide outside horses through the turn, angled six wide for the drive with a chance for a piece of the prize but
failed to fire running to the wire. BLUE MONTJEU had a slow start to begin, stalked in the third flight between runners, made little headway throughout the
turn two wide and lacked a rally behind runners in the stretch running. LOADED JUSTICE veered out on the break, prompted three wide on the outside
down the backstretch, dueled outside around the turn, was pinballed between runners while in the hunt near the lead at the three sixteenths marker and
stopped soon afterwards.

HARD TO CAPTURE was nestled on the rail behind the lead pair down the backside, shifted out measuring the embattled leaders three wide in midturn,
angled to the four path turning for home, found another gear when encouraged right handed at the furlong pole and with a strong late kick inched away for
the win in deep stretch. GIVE ME THE BOOTS seized command from the start, had a narrow margin leading inside at the quarter pole, spurted away from
the early speed foe in mid-stretch but could not find more late to fend off the late charge by the winner. NORTHERN RUBY stalked close to the back inside
of a rival, began to pass runners moving in on the fence three furlongs from the wire, angled out with momentum four wide straightening out for the drive,
showed good late energy to finish up and close in for third money. SUGAR IS GOLDEN broke outwards to begin, pressed the pace outside down the
backstretch, dueled head to head by the quarter pole, was on in the mix up front between horses in the three path turning for home, was on the wrong lead
to the finish line and faded to settle for a minor role in the end. ONANDONANDON was pushed out by the inside rival on the break, stalked near the rear on
the outside down the backstretch, made no progression three wide on the turn and was one paced on the rail in the stretch running. CEFALO tracked the
front duo while outside a foe along the backside, was hard ridden three furlongs out but was going the wrong way on the turn and could not get involved
through the lane. COLOR FORCE settled in midfield between horses in the early going, was shuffled back to last by the half, lost touch with the field around
the turn and could not be a factor in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
P. S. RISING STAR was carried out a bit at the start, angled in heading to the first turn saving some ground racing near but off the rail mid-pack, advanced
while being guided out on the far turn, came into upper stretch six wide with aim, struck the front in mid-stretch and powered past. TAKE CHANCES was
shut off and steadied shortly after the break, angled in and brought up the rear, saved ground, rallied up the rail to just get up for place. I HAVE AN IDEA
was coaxed forward inside early, made the lead and spurted clear, dictated terms up the backstretch, was challenged midway on the far turn and headed by
the quarter pole, drifted off the rail turning for home, kept on to repel that foe but was no match for the winner and lost place late. BRITISH CROWN angled
in early racing three wide between foes toward the back into the first turn, settled well back biding time through the far turn advancing late on that bend three
to four wide, moved out a bit for the drive then angled out nine deep in mid-stretch, gained steadily and slowly but needed more. SECRET GIZMO settled at
the back inside saving ground, moved out to pass a rival two to three wide on the far turn, lugged in a bit near the eighth pole, kept on well late. FOREVER
DANISH got away well, ceded the lead content to stalk two to three wide, advanced willingly on that foe on the far turn drawing even past the five-sixteenths
and putting a short head in front near the quarter pole, drifted out a bit turning for home, faltered in upper stretch and faded. SEATTLE CAUSEWAY broke
out a bit, was well-placed outside a foe stalking from the second flight three to four wide early, was in a hair tight in upper stretch seeking room in behind
and inside runners, angled eight wide in mid-stretch and ran on without threatening late. FEDALINE settled inside tracking off the leaders, saved ground
through both turns, was in tight between foes near the eighth pole while weakening and continued to fade thereafter. MAKAYLA was three to four wide
outside mid-pack early, ridden along outside the three-eighths and racing a bit wider into the far turn, had no response. FOREST VIXEN was outside foes
four wide at the back early and never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
WEEHAWKEN took control from the onset while on the fence, patiently relinquished the front to a rival who was determined get up top down the
backstretch, easily reclaimed the top spot switching to the outside at the half, opened up at will turning for home and had no competitors around at the finish
line. MIZZEN ASH was unhurried to trail after the break, began to go by rivals inside mid-backstretch, improved smartly on the rail through the turn, shifted
out, extending her stride three eighths from the finish, angled out widest in the seven path at the top of the lane and closed belatedly to win the duel for the
distant runners up share at the wire. KAVALA travelled on the rail keeping close tabs on the lead pair at the half, closed the gap mildly on the leader two
furlongs to go, was no match for the winner in mid-stretch and fought on stubbornly for the place share to the end but just lost out on the nod when crossing
the wire. ANAM CARA was reined back to watch the contesting early speed battle down the backside, tracked between foes in the second flight through the
turn, shifted five wide straightening out for home in the hunt for second money in upper stretch, was outfinished to the wire and settled for a minor role in the
end. SPIDER BELLE was allowed to settle into stride to trail midway down the backstretch, loped along at the rear in the turn and showed some interest in
the three path to pass tired runners down the lane. DIOSA CATRINA travelled between horses in midfield along the backside, made no change in position
three wide outside horses around the bend, shifted to the six path for the drive but had no finish to offer to the wire. HELLO FRIENDS settled outside foes
four deep along the backside ahead of two rivals, offered a brief rally three wide in upper stretch to be in the mix for a piece of the prize with three sixteenths
from the wire, could not sustain the run and faded on the fence in the final furlong. LADY EVA was hustled three wide outside foes chasing the pace early
on, to over the front with three quarters left to go, had no answer when collared outside by the winner four furlongs from home and backed away through the
field on the turn.

Footnotes
TAYLORMOON settled in behind the leaders tracking the pace not too far back, moved out midway on the turn coming to the five-sixteenths three wide and
advancing willingly, bid in upper stretch taking the lead by the furlong marker, drove clear and held. REMEMBERING RHODA chased between runners
mid-pack, moved out five wide in upper stretch, kept on and secured the place. MISS BOBBIT steadied when in tight leaving the backstretch racing along
the rail, saved ground through the turn and finished well inside but needed more. SEATTLE SIGNAL was driven to the lead after the opening sixteenth, set
the pace racing just off the rail, was challenged late on the turn, no match for the winner and weakened from between runners in late stretch. NORMA NO
was very reluctant to load, settled at the back, moved four to six wide on the turn, was lightly brushed leaving that bend, ran on in the stretch. WICKED
MIAH was in tight after the break and shuffled to the rear, advanced outside foes five to six wide on the turn, evened out in the lane. CASTLETON got away
well but was soon overtaken, pursued the eventual winner from outside, put to urging by the five-sixteenths and dropped back, weakened thereafter. ITS A
BIRDIE pursued from outside mid-pack, was ridden along by the five-sixteenths going four then five wide on the turn, brushed an outside foe at the top of
the stretch, failed to threaten. STORMY SUZIE settled toward the rear, swung nine wide, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
EL COHETE broke out, bumping inside foes to start, was ahead of only one runner while under a snug hold along the backside, moved in sharply, circling
four wide around horses in the turn, loomed a menacing presence turning for home and took over at the furlong marker to draw off for the win at the finish
line. VICTORY TOWN was away alertly for the lead while hounded outside down the backstretch, began to edge away by midturn from the early pace rival,
braced for the challenge from the winner outside at the quarter pole but could not find more late and gave way with a furlong to go to settle for second best
on this day. ROAR OF THE CROWD had a tardy start, recovered to prompt the pace outside in the early going, could not match strides with the top two
leaders at the quarter pole but did stay on determinedly to the finish line, saving for the show money. UNCAPTURED MOMENT broke inwards, bumping foe
on the start, tracked two wide with horses on both side down the backstretch, made no improvement around the bend, angled to the four path straightening
out for home and showed some late interest closing in late for a minor share. POSTURING was off a step slow to begin, seeing the field down the backside,
was roused, but made no impression around the turn, shifted out in the three path just when he was starting to make a run when losing its rail path at the
furlong marker and could only pass one late. JAGGERSGOTAGUN was urged on the rail for a better inside position leaving the chute, watched the lead pair
while tucked in on the rail at the half, came under a ride three furlongs out but could not quicken with others making a move on the outside and yielded on
the fence in mid-stretch. FAIRWAY TO HEAVEN tracked four deep outsider rivals along the backside, ran evenly three wide outside horses midway on the
turn, angled to the five path for the drive but never reached contention running to the wire.

Footnotes
SPEEDY ESSA broke out on the start, settled outside foes in mid-division along the backside, started to uncork a rally three around horses at the quarter
marker, wore down the lead trio at the seventy yard pole and just had enough to hold on at the wire for the victory. SMILES FOR DAVID stalked outside
runners near the back down the backstretch, started to rally three wide, following the winner at the quarter pole, shifted inwards to the five path at the top of
the lane, had to then switch outside lacking room with a sixteenth to go and really got into gear late, just missing with a surge at the wire for the win.
PRACTICAL GIZMO was bumped inside on the break, travelled on the fence, keeping tabs on the top two in the early stages of the race, never wavered
down the lane, determinedly closed in to pass the early leaders with a sixteenth to go but gave way grudgingly very late to the closing pair to settle for a
gutsy third place finish in the end. ZODIAC BEACH trailed the field in the early going, began to pick up runners outside in the two path by the quarter pole,
swung out widest for clear run in the six path turning for home and was full of run at the furlong marker, closing well late for a minor role at the wire. PROUD
SPEAKER broke out to begin, took command on the rail down the backside, lost the lead outside at the quarter pole, resurged on the fence to reclaim the
top spot with a furlong to go but had little left in deep stretch and wilted with seventy yards from the finish line. BLONDE DYNAMO was pushed out on the
break, stalked close to the back of the pack on the rail, took the shortest way around in the turn and finished up willingly with a rail trip down the stretch.
HEKLA'S AURA broke outwards on the start, settled in midfield on the rail down the backstretch, could not gain any momentum in the third flight with the
eventual winner on his outside at the quarter pole and finished up evenly in the two path down the lane. THATSITTHATSALL was situated close to the back
of the pack, three wide between horses along the backside, made no gain on rivals while travelling three wide through the turn and lacked a bid in the
stretch drive. CONTAGIOUSLAUGHTER settled near the rear in the two path down the backside, made little advancement while on the fence around the
turn and had little to show in the stretch running. LILLZ HOPE was in hand early, quite content to watch the leaders down the backstretch, moved in to
briefly take command outside at the quarter pole, ran out of stream by the furlong marker and stopped, backing through the field in deep stretch.
