KENTUCKY GO GO was unrushed between rivals, rallied in the five path at the quarter pole and drew off at the sixteenth pole under mild urging. KARADIA
was clear on the first turn inside, was challenged on the far turn, then couldn't hold off the closer. OVER THE OCEAN stalked the pace in the four path and
bid late to nab the show. DADDY'S DINERO stalked the pace in the two path, bid at the quarter pole, dueled and was caught for the show spot. SNOW
KING stalked the pace in the two path, moved inside to bid past the three-sixteenths pole, forcing HOT WINGS to check, lacked room and steadied to give
way. HOT WINGS stalked inside, bid at the quarter pole and was checked at the eighth pole when a rival came in. WICKED MELODY trailed inside, angled
five wide at the quarter pole and improved position late. UNCLE CAESAR was unrushed inside, came out in early stretch and bumped a rival, then had no
late bid. TIN TOP ROAD raced in the four path and was bumped at the eighth pole when TIN TOP ROAD came out. KALAHARI KING was off awkwardly
and impeded at the start, then was unrushed in the three path. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, SNOW KING WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED
SIXTH FOR INTERFERENCE TO HOT WINGS IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
MOLLY'S AUSSIE was clear early, drew off in the stretch and lasted under a steady drive. BITS OF CANDY stalked the pace in the three path, was shuffled
back at the three-eighths pole, rallied at the three-sixteenths pole and closed strongly. LITTLERANSOMSFIRE hopped and was bumped at the start, stalked
the pace inside but lacked a closing bid. PONTMETOTHEBOURBON stalked the pace in the four path and lacked a closing bid. PERNICIOUS bore out at
the start, raced in the five path and faded in the stretch. ERIN bore in at the start, stalked the pace in the two path and faded in the stretch. GOT THE LIFE
stumbled at the start, stalked the pace in the two path and gave way on the far turn. SECRET SAVIOR was herded out at the start, then gave way on the
turn. WHO NOT WHAT was off awkwardly. RICH GIRLS DREAMS saved ground to no avail.
