Footnotes
WANDA STRONG got away well to secure a spot along the inside, set the pace while racing in hand, drew off for a clear lead entering the stretch, was
shortening strides late and held off the late charge of MISS RIVER RAT while under steady urging. MISS RIVER RAT settled off the pace in a good position,
was roused on the far turn, surged late and was gaining fast. SHE'S WANDAFUL moved up inside along the backstretch, backed up on the turn, bid off the
rail to get within range, hung and settled for show. WHAT'S TO DO lagged early, lacked room entering the second turn, bid three wide and didn't have
enough late. BALI BABY broke out and was steadied at the start, raced in the back, swung wide entering the stretch and had nothing left for the drive. LADY
HELENA veered out at the start, raced close to the pace, tired on the far turn and gave way. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

ROCKET HOTSHOT was unhurried early, raced outside, rallied around the second turn, challenged for the lead entering the stretch and drew off under
encouragement. PATH TO SUCCESS trailed the field, dropped inside on the backstretch to save ground, angled out into the second turn, bid six wide and
closed well to earn place while no threat to the winner. EUCLID AVENUE was sent to the front to set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead,
weakened in the drive and held safely for show. ELECTRIC CHARGE stalked the pace while racing inside, fell back into the second turn, bid inside, altered
course in the upper stretch and came up empty. ALVIN stalked the pace to the second turn, flattened out and dropped back.

LOST SUNSET broke out, vied to the turn, inched away, closed under mild urging, drew off late and won going away. FLATHEAD FINALE broke out, vied to
turn, fell back, closed inside, was no match late and all out for place. IRISH SPARK vied inside early, fell back into the turn, shifted out, bid off the rail,
couldn't gain ground and held safely for show. SWEET SMILA bumped lightly at the start, pressed the pace towards the outside, challenged for the lead on
the turn, weakened in the drive and faded. GOOD MAGIC WOMAN vied between horses early, fell back and had no further response. BABAS GAL failed to
threaten in an even effort. MISS MADALINE was void of early speed, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. PRETTY SKYE was crowded and
bumped lightly at the start and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PILKINGTON came in at the start, was allowed to settle and saved ground to the backstretch, angled out, rallied into the turn, went six wide entering the
stretch, dueled with STREET FEST to mid stretch and drew off under mild urging. STREET FEST sprinted clear to set the pace with a long lead, responded
when challenged to duel, was no match late and held for place. GOLDENTOWN was slow early, dropped back entering the far turn, swung wide into the
stretch, closed with a rush and was gaining for second. LICENSE TO STEAL raced inside to the second turn, bid six wide entering the stretch, had little left
and failed to menace. SPINNING HEART settled off the pace, rallied into the turn, bid and came up empty. GIANNO broke out, was never far back,
advanced to the turn to get within range and had nothing left for the drive. SHARP STRIKE trailed the field and passed tiring rivals. WOLF HUNTER settled
off the pace, showed speed to the second turn and stopped. I O FEDRO broke out and failed to threaten in an even effort.
