Footnotes
ASHBURY stalked outside runners in the third flight in the beginning, moved in closer, to track two wide outside foes down the backstretch, was roused
between challengers closing the gap on the pacesetter midway on the far turn, bid for the lead outside in upper stretch, finally wore down the stubborn
frontrunner at the sixteenth pole and drew away late. QUIET INTENT assumed command right from the start, opened up of the field into the back straight,
continued to set an even pace up top around the final bend, was headed outside by the winner in upper stretch, relinquished the lead with a sixteenth to go
and easily bested the rest at the finish line. CORNWALL was squeezed on the break, stalked between horses near the back in the first turn, improved
outside rivals, three deep along the backside, made little headway on the leaders four wide in the far turn and kept on trying to the wire to just get up for the
battle for the show money. GUNS N' ROJAS travelled in mid-pack on the rail in the first of two turns, made a brief rally three wide around horses with three
furlongs remaining, chased the contesting lead duo down the lane and faded late, just saving for a minor role at the wire. WINSTON BLUE stalked near the
rear on the rail in the early going, shifted outside making little headway along the backside outside foes, could not get involved around the final bend and
finished up mildly between runners dueling for a minor share in the end. RAVELLO BEAUTY was off a step slow to begin, trailed three wide in the first turn,
settled in last on the fence down the backside, saved ground but made little progress on the final turn and failed to fire in the two path between rivals at the
furlong marker. SHAMATEUR tracked the pacesetter in the first turn, took closer order on the fence down the back straight, was scrubbed on three furlongs
out, had nothing more to offer and emptied out by the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
SOCIETY'S THUNDER settled on the rail, rating kindly behind the lead threesome down the backside, patiently bided his time behind runners around the
bend, found a seam in the three path turning for home and pulled away for a convincing win in the final sixteenth. YACHT BOY had a good spot outside,
watching the dueling trio, began to circle around runner four wide in midturn, swooped to the lead in the five path by upper stretch but was out finished by
the winner in the last sixteenth. STAYHONOR GOODSIDE was checked at the start, trailed along the backside, continued to see the field around the turn
but was taking closer order, shifted out four wide at the quarter pole gaining momentum, loomed a menacing presence five wide for the drive, shifted
inwards in upper stretch, lost his path while in the hunt up front at the sixteenth pole and finished up a non threatening third. RELOAD'S REBEL had his
head in front with runners on both side applying pressure down the backstretch, began to inch away from the early pace rivals in midturn, was collared
outside by another challenger in upper stretch and yielded in the two path in the final furlong. ADELAIDE COURT broke out on the start, dueled inside down
the backstretch, kept pace on the fence just inside the leader throughout the turn, skimmed the fence turning for home still in the mix but needed more late
and tired at the furlong marker. VALYRIAN SKY prompted the pace three deep outside the leader down the backstretch, continued the three wide journey
chasing the pacesetter around the turn, began to show signs of weakening between runners at the quarter pole and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
LIVE LUCKY pulled the rider to the lead with five furlongs to go, comfortably dictated the pace, moving well up top around the turn and when finally asked in
mid-stretch drew away with authority for the victory. SUMMER COMMANDER took control at the start, was shuffled back some positions while on the fence
through the turn, shifted out from behind the winner in the two path with a quarter to run and chased in vain to the wire still holding on to best the rest in the
end. JO DADDY stalked near the rear on the rail in the early going, kept pace when the field was bunching up midway through the turn, was in range of the
winner in the three path at the quarter pole and finished up willingly to be a clear third when crossing the finish line. READY TO COLLECT tracked outside
down the backstretch, moved in closer to chase the frontrunner around the bend, was in the thick of things three wide turning for home, could not find
another gear and stalled at the furlong marker. JUNIOR HOT SHOT was three wide outside foes in mid-pack down the backside, was coaxed for more with
five sixteenths from home, angled to the five path, having a chance for a share of the prize in upper stretch but was one paced to the wire. CRIMINAL
INTENT settled in mid-division between runners in the early stages, shifted out to be five wide for the drive to the wire but just could not get involved running
down the lane to the finish line. ZIPPY GIZMO trailed the field along the backside, began to pick up horses three wide outside rivals with three eighths to go,
angled out widest in the six path when the field fanned out straightening for the drive but lacked a rally through the stretch.

Footnotes
LUCKY ROMANCE settled off the leaders mid-pack outside two to three wide, was encouraged along three to four wide coming past the three-eighths,
advanced on the leader and put a short head in front near the three-sixteenths, lugged in and dueled with a rival, brushed that one in late stretch and fought
hard to prevail. FANORE (IRE) was bumped into a rival lightly at the start, moved forward to gain stalking position just off the leading pair three wide, rated
early up the backstretch, edged nearer heading to the far turn, bid to take the lead at the five-sixteenths, was headed in upper stretch, dueled inside, was
brushed by that rival late, fought on gamely but could make no headway late. OUR FLAG FLYING settled outside at the rear, began to pick it up three then
four wide on the far turn, gained in the stretch but needed more late. SUGAR IT'S ELI bumped the inside rival lightly at the start, settled at the back inside a
foe but off the fence, waited through the far turn, angled out six wide in upper stretch, ran on to improve. BEARING DOWN was urged forward from the start
then ceded the lead to an outside foe, switched outside that one into the first turn to press, moved to the lead near the five- and one-half and clear, set the
pace up the backstretch, came up empty for the drive. SILVER SMOKE was lightly bumped at the start then coaxed to the lead, made it and shifted in
before entering the first turn, set the pace around that bend but was soon overtaken. continued to chase from inside, failed to rally in the stretch. SMART
ALMASTY settled tracking inside, was two to three wide on the far turn, failed to menace. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF FANORE
(IRE) AGAINST LUCKY ROMANCE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
OLIVIA ROSE took control right from the start, opened up to increase the advantage with three furlongs to go, was finally set down in the two path when the
lead was diminishing at the furlong pole and held safe when kept to the task in deep stretch. LITTLE TEDDY was content to track the frontrunner outside
down the back straight, was roused at the quarter pole, drifted in momentarily in upper stretch, shifted out to the three path with three sixteenths from the
wire, closed the gap when urged left handed at the furlong marker and valiantly never wavered to the wire but could not reel in the winner late. TABLOID
MATERIAL stalked on the rail near the back of the pack down the backside, saved ground but made little headway around the bend, picked up the bit
quickly to close in sharply on the fence in the mix for the show award in upper stretch and finished up the best of the trio battling for third in the final
sixteenth. MIRAMICHI settled in the middle of the pack on the fence in the early stages of the race, shifted outside with five sixteenths from the wire, battled
for the show award in the six path in upper stretch but stalled with a furlong remaining and settled on the fringes in the end. JUST FOLLOW ME stalked
outside near the rear in the backstretch, closed the gap two wide outside a rival to duel for third money with five sixteenths from home, angled out to the six
path for drive, could not go on and faltered while drifting in by mid-stretch. RED ELEANOR was unhurried early on to trail the field along the backside, saved
ground but could not make any progress through the turn and could not get involved in the running to the wire.

Footnotes
KOKOMO broke sharply but soon after veered out abruptly, corrected and shifted back nearer inside setting the pace from off the rail, was headed in upper
stretch, fought on gamely dueling inside, was resurgent in very late stretch to retake command and prevail. HE'S NOT JOKING moved forward after the
start switching outside the eventual winner three wide up the backstretch stalking that one, advanced willingly on the turn, struck a narrow lead in upper
stretch, was put to the test and dueled with that inside foe but was outfinished while well clear of the rest. NOTORIOUS GANGSTER broke inwardly then
veered out, then shifted in and was carried in a bit racing toward the back three to four wide the remainder of the way up the backstretch, was still well back
of the top ones on the turn, advanced in the stretch and kept on to get up for show honors. CRUCIAL TAUNT was bumped and bobbled at the start then
forced in soon after bumping a rival in the early going, was in a bit tight soon after between and behind foes, finally had space to settle stalking two to three
wide, put to urging near the quarter pole, drifted in a bit in upper stretch, could not maintain show honors but was clear for the minor award. CHARTED MAP
shifted in early, raced forwardly five wide between runners heading to the turn, checked sharply past the seven-sixteenths dropping well back, kept on in the
stretch to improve. AWE INSPIRED was forwardly-placed stalking four wide, failed to rally. COLCHESTER was bumped and steadied just after the break,
moved forward outside heading into the turn six then five wide, was close late on that bend but flattened out for the drive while drifting a bit. LOVER BOY
MO bumped a rival and bobbled slightly at the start, was bumped into a rival soon after, shifted in to the rail heading up the backstretch, saved ground on
the turn, ran on one-paced. YLIVOIMAINEN was in tight quarters early as rivals came in, took up briefly and switched out off the inside, steadied again
slightly in tight quarters, raced outside at the back three to four wide into the turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch, ran on evenly. NAUGHTY FROSTY
was forced out and in tight just after the break, raced in behind and outside into the turn about four to five wide, altered out sharply seven wide nearing the
three-eighths as a rival checked in front, came back in a bit and failed to sustain a rally thereafter. SPIRITUAL MAN bumped a rival at the start then was
bumped inward shortly thereafter, raced at the back inside, failed to menace. JUST JACOBO was bumped at the start then bumped into a foe in the early
going, was between foes at the rear two to three wide into the turn, came out five deep in upper stretch, was never a threat.

Footnotes
PALIO tracked inside in the second tier, settled on the fence in midfield watching the trio up front engage around the turn, rallied inside with three eighths
from the wire, continued to move in to bid on the rail at the furlong marker and finished the late charge taking over in the last sixteenth for the win.
NINETYFOUR EXPOS assumed the lead down the backstretch, opened up, increasing the advantage heading into the turn, maintained a slim advantage in
the two path turning for home, dug in stubbornly when foes closed in on both sides three sixteenths from the line, gave way grudgingly to the winner in deep
stretch but stayed on late to hold off an outside foe for the place share. ONENIGHTSTANDARDS travelled outside a runner to track the leader down the
backstretch, edged closer three wide to the pacesetter through the turn, threatened for the lead four wide in upper stretch, inched closer with a sixteenth
remaining, hesitated for a stride with seventy yards to go and could only finish gradually in deep stretch for the show award. HAVE IT MY WAY was ahead
of only one rival along the backside, co-trailed inside a runner at the half, still could see the group straightening out for home and finished with good intent in
the three path to get up for a minor role at the finish line. TARANTO TITAN reared on the break, stalked near the back on the outside in the early going,
improved to track the trio outside throughout the turn, shifted five wide for the drive between horses but needed more in the last furlong to play a role in the
end. MEHLEK was allowed to settle at the rear in the early going, co-trailed outside a challenger with four furlongs to run, swung out widest in the six path to
be in range for a share when the entire field fanned out with three sixteenths to go but wilted with a sixteenth left to run. PAINTTHETOWNSILVER pressed
the pace to start, tracked inside down the backstraight, was ridden for more keeping pace on the fence in midturn, travelled three wide while in the mix up
front at the top of the lane, could not continue on and yielded in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
J P HELLISH was prominent into the first turn, ceded the lead content to track from inside saving ground, angled four wide passing the quarter pole, bid
between foes in upper stretch, was beat to the front by SOUTH BEND but fought on inside that one determinedly to prevail. RON'S GIZMO settled outside
at the rear, was encouraged along moving out from four to six wide on the far turn, gained steadily through the stretch and got up for place while falling short
of the top prize. SOUTH BEND exchanged a light bump at the start, settled toward the rear off the inside, advanced four to five wide on the far turn, struck a
narrow lead in upper stretch, dueled and was outfinished for both the win and lost place late. TWIN CITY broke a bit awkwardly, was forwardly-placed three
wide into the first turn, stalked then pressed the leader into the far turn, challenged for the lead late on that bend, lacked the needed late kick. GRANDSON
exchanged minor contact at the start, angled in and unhurriedly brought up the rear, swung seven wide for the drive, passed tired rivals. WENTRU rated in
behind the leaders stalking while up close, failed to rally. AHA MOMENT moved forward outside a rival taking the lead on the first turn, set the pace from off
the rail, faltered and faded. MAAKWA was forwardly-positioned but caught four wide into the first turn, stalked from outside up close three to four deep into
the far turn, asked for more at the five-sixteenths but came up empty.

Footnotes
WAR STRATEGY tracked outside, began to edge closer throughout the turn, pounced three wide outside with three sixteenths from the finish and was
going away smartly in deep stretch for the win. WESTERN WHIRL was hustled for the lead, clearing to the rail midway along the backstretch, dictated the
pace up front through the turn, had a slim advantage in the two path with rivals closing in outside at the top of the stretch, was not match for the winner with
an eighth left to run but finished up well enough to still manage to be a clear second in the end. CAUSIN' MAYHEM had a tracking role on the fence in the
beginning, kept pace when roused for more on the rail around the bend, sat just behind the dueling leaders at the top of the lane, could not close gap on
them to the wire but stayed on for the show award. KING ELVIS was brushed inside at the start, travelled in midfield outside foes three wide down the
backstretch, watched the lead duo while between runners around the oval, shifted to be four wide in the hunt with the front group at the top of the lane, was
one paced with a furlong to go and just held for a minor share at the wire. BRITISH ARTILLERY travelled between runners in the two path down the
backstretch, moved in closer three wide while in hand around the bend, angled five wide to be in the fray up front battling for a share in upper stretch, could
not continue the run and flattened out with a furlong remaining. TOUR THE CITY broke with the field but was slow getting into stride, trailing down the back
straight, narrowed the margin but could not gain any positioning through the turn, while seeing the field in upper stretch in the four path starting to pick up
the pace and passed a few runners in deep stretch. CHAMBER MUSIC stalked near the rear inside, took the shortest way around through the turn but could
not make any improvement, was asked in the three path by upper stretch and finished up willingly on the fence in deep stretch. GILT EDGE travelled in
mid-division on the rail down the backstretch, made little headway through the turn in the two path, shifted six wide straightening out for home bit could not
get involved running to the wire. MYRA'S BOY broke out to begin, was ahead of only one other runner down the backside, offered a brief run three wide
outside rivals around the bend, angled to the seven path for the drive but folded with a furlong to go.

Footnotes
DIOMEDES broke out, bumping the outside foe on the start, took command into the first turn, set the pace along the backside, briefly lost the lead to an
outside rival at the quarter pole and resurged in the stretch to win the duel to the wire inside for the victory. CABERNAYDO was situated on the fence near
the rear in the first bend, shifted outside in the three path at the half starting to rally, made a quick move circling rivals at the seven sixteenths pole,
momentarily poke his head in front outside out the quarter pole, battled with the very game winner in the stretch but was denied at the wire. QUIET KNIGHT
hopped on the break, stalked close to the back outside horses, improved three wide outside rivals down the back straight, ran evenly three wide around the
final bend, swung out to the four path turning for home and found his best stride late to close in smartly to the wire to get up for third money. HELLO LADIES
stalked in the third tier outside a rival in the first turn, made an early move three deep to press the pace at the half, chased the winner while between runners
in the far turn and was one paced in the stretch to hold for a minor share. DUBAWI BULL stalked two wide outside foes to begin, made no progress in the
middle stages of the race, angled out five wide at the top of the lane and showed some interest late to pass weary foes to the finish line. REBEL FAITH
tracked on the rail in the first of two turns, was reined back to settle on the fence in midfield along the backside, was urged for more run three eighths out,
could not keep up with the leaders through the far turn and failed to menace in the stretch drive. GOOD POINT stalked on the inside in the third flight into
the first turn, kept a close eye on the lead trio at the half, began to edge closer when scrubbed on at the three furlong pole, was in range in the four path for
the stretch running but could not go on and retreated at the sixteenth pole inside of rivals. BEE ME broke in, exchanging bumps with the inside rival on the
start, tracked outside in the early stages, watched the embattled trio while nestled on the fence at the quarter pole, was taken a hold of losing its path on the
rail nearing the furlong marker and weakened in deep stretch. REDNECK REBEL had a tardy start to trail on the fence, caught up to the pack inside by the
half but could not be a presence in the running down the stretch.
