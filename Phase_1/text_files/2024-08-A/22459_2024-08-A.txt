Footnotes
LADY FORTUNE never far back, responded with a rapid move four then five wide into the stretch making the lead before the furlong marker and proved
best under right handed urging while fully extended. BOOGIE BOOGEE allowed to settle, bulled her way through between rivals three wide entering the
stretch, bumped and just missed. DANZA MAGIC trailed into the turn then closed ground rapidly outside rivals. CITY SIGNS failed to menace. JETTIN
PEGASUS was no factor. CLIFTONS BALLERINA stalked the early pace three wide, moved closer nearing the top of the stretch, was bumped near the
three sixteenths pole then lost momentum. EXACTITUDE battled for the lead two wide into the stretch, drifted out bumping BOOGIE BOOGEE into
CLIFTONS BALLERINA near the three sixteenths pole, was bumped repeatedly by THE DEVIL'S DREAM before the furlong marker then gave way. THE
DEVIL'S DREAM dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch, drifted out bumping with EXACTITUDE repeatedly while under left handed urging
before the furlong marker then was used up. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
MY BEST DAY EVER chased the pace into the stretch, was carried out to the six path by the leader, made the lead at the furlong marker, drifted out to the
middle of the racetrack under left handed urging and drew off. REDWINEANDWHISKEY never far back, swung wide, had a mild late rally in the middle of
the racetrack and finished well clear for second. STRATOGALE broke in front, set the pace into the stretch, drifted to the five path and weakened in the final
furlong. INSATIABLE EVA stalked the early pace along the inside and failed to respond. PANOLA failed to menace. VIMISOFA checked between horses at
the five furlong marker, angled outside then was no threat. THE RIDER OF VIMISOFA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE
WINNER FOR ALLGED INTERFERENCE SOON AFTER THE START. FOLLOWING A REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF
FINISH.

responded readily when set down nearing the top of the stretch, made the lead under left handed urging near the furlong marker and edged clear in the final

the pace to the top of the stretch then was outfinished. CLOAK AND DAGGER well placed, failed to respond. SIR trailed.

urging while drifting out and wore down rivals in a game effort. CROSSED UP never far back, swung wide, closed willingly five wide through deep stretch
and just missed getting up in time. LADY JASPER pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, gained a narrow lead inside the furlong marker then was
outfinished despite a game effort. MARKET SUCCESS well placed, altered course four wide at the top of the stretch and finished with good courage. LA
ROSA failed to menace. PANAMANIAC pressed the pace three wide into the stretch then weakened.
