STILL GRUMPY raced in the four path the first turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole and took the nod two deep entering the stretch, dug in through
the final furlong and dueled clear later yards. CITY OF ARCHES quickly took over and rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the five
sixteenths pole, gave up the lead at the rail leaving the far turn and relented in the duel through the stretch. HOUSE ALERT stalked off the rail, picked up
the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. SHAMELESS VISIONS settled off the rail the first turn,
gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, angled out toward the head of the lane and showed little more. JUNE BELLE
raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little in the lane.
SISTER WINNIE veered out leaving the gate then stalked in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded through the
far turn. FAR MORE was forced out leaving the gate, raced in the five path the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response.

turn but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. DR RENDEZVOUS stumbled leaving the gate then picked up the chase inside, rounded the turn off
the rail, dug in to take aim between horses leaving the turn but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. ROAD PUNCH was hustled to the lead
approaching the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, gave up the lead at the rail nearing the quarter pole, remained a factor through the turn
but was outfinished in the drive. JUBA'S MOCHA chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail, eased out entering the stretch and finished
evenly. MONKEY WRENCH gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened in the lane. GREATEST NOTION gave chase outside and
rounded the turn about the five path. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Dr Rendezvous for alleged interference in the
vicinity of the quarter pole, lodged by the rider of Juba's Mocha.

Footnotes
PLAYING FOR TWO broke in and made contact with COWGIRL ATTITUDE then gave chase, raced close in the four path on the turn, dug in under steady
handling leaving the turn and took the nod in the final jump. The latter was jostled leaving the gate then gave chase, took the lead at the rail approaching the
head of the lane, was steadily handled leaving the turn but was nipped just under the wire. LET'S DO THIS chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn and
ran evenly in the lane. TRUE BUCKPASSING was hustled to the front past the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, gave up the lead two deep
approaching the head of the lane, drifted leaving the turn then flattened late yards. SHEWEARSSTILETTOS gave chase through the backstretch, rounded
the turn about the five path and finished well to close the gap. WINDSOR'S MEMORY pressured the pace, raced in the three path on the turn but was
carried out toward the head of the lane and flattened stride. BALI HAI was pinched back approaching the seven sixteenths pole then gave chase, raced
wide on the turn and showed little in the lane. MY SWEETHEART DANI was not a factor. STORMI VANNA broke out and made contact with Cowgirl
Attitude and was pinched back past the half mile pole, angled out early then angled in approaching the quarter pole.

Footnotes
JUBA'S HAT TRICK stalked from the three path the first turn, took aim leaving the seven sixteenths pole and had the lead past the three eighths pole,
contested even terms two deep on the far turn, dueled clear in later yards and held on well. I'LLTAKECAREOFIT tapered in and took the lead into the first
turn then rated the pace, was met past the three eighths pole and gave chase from that point, contested even terms nearest the rail on the far turn but
relented in late yards. LORD OF CORK settled two deep on the first turn, moved to the outside into the backstretch and gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and finished well to close the gap. LOGSTRADAMUS rated close inside on the opening turn,
picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little further. ROCK ANNA ROLL saved ground. ROAD
PARTY tapered in with a brief early lead then stalked into the first turn, gave chase leaving the turn but faded off the rail into the far turn. KAYLEE'S
SPITFIRE showed little response leaving the first turn.

outfinished the final sixteenth. STARLITE WALKER tapered in and stalked off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced
close in the three path on the far turn but drifted leaving the turn and flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. MARK DID IT rounded the opening turn about

Footnotes
S S ITS FUN TO RUN pressured the pace three wide while between horses through the backstretch, took the lead nearing the quarter pole and dug in
under determined handling to hold on. GOLDEN RUN pressured the pace two deep while between horses through the backstretch, contested at a close
disadvantage off the rail on the turn and finished well to clear second late yards. NEVER MORE VALOR was hustled to the lead at the seven sixteenths
pole and set a pressured pace, was met while steadying approaching the quarter pole, dropped back at the rail past the pole and flattened stride inside the
sixteenth pole. NEVER WALK ALONE pressured the pace four wide and raced close through the turn, but flattened stride later yards. GET LOADED gave
chase outside, rounded the turn in the four path and ran evenly down the lane. HIDDEN RIVER came away awkward and gave only distant chase while
saving ground. GATOR TWENTY FIVE gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and weakened. SK'S HEART chased, rounded the turn in the three path
and weakened in the lane. MISTYMORNINGSGIRL saved ground.
