HORATIO away alertly and pressed the pace three wide in the run down the backstretch, took control three wide entering the final turn, and continued to
widen his advantage over the final furlong while being ridden out late. MAX BOOSTER was bumped soon after the start, but saved ground through the first
turn to gain a tracking trip in the run down the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the
drive to get up for the place. ANDALEIGH tracked the dueling leaders two wide from between rivals in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering
the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive to get up for a share. ON MY GOOD SIDE tracked the leaders into the backstretch while carried four wide,
continued with a four wide trip through the final turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive. RAILWAY POLICE away well and vied for the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, was quickly overtaken entering the final turn, but faded in the late
stages, and brushed against the rail late while laying in. BE SPARKY broke sharply and dueled for the lead two wide from between rivals in the run down
the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on his pace rival entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. THINKIN BACK bobbled and ducked
in slightly at the start, bumping with a rival to his inside, trailed the field throughout, and showed little. It was reported that the rider of THINKIN BACK lost his
whip in the run down the backstretch.

Footnotes
PINEAPPLE TIDBITS away well and was allowed to settle off the sharp early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time,
continued to save ground through the second turn, gained ground on the pacesetter in the run down the backstretch, swept to the lead two wide entering the
final turn, and held OSTACIZE safely at bay late to prevail. OSTRACIZE was unprepared at the start, and hopped while hitting the side of the gate to get
away poorly, settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, gained ground on the leader in the run down
the backside, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in the drive to be easily second best, while unable
to overcome her poor start. VALERIE VALESKI away alertly and sprinted to a clear lead from along the rail entering the first turn, held an uncontested lead
through the second turn and in the run down the backside, was quickly overhauled entering the final turn, and faded late while drifting five wide, but
managed to hold on for a share. TOBESUNNY unhurried early while trailing the field into the stretch the first time, continued to bid her time at the back of
the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and was carried six wide in deep stretch, but lacked the needed closing
response when called upon. CERTIFIABLE broke sharply and stalked the lone pacesetter into the lane the first time while racing one out from the rail,
struggled to maintain her position leaving the second turn, and steadily retreated. Following the running of this race the stewards conducted an inquiry into
the start of the race. after review there was no change to the original order of finish

Footnotes
STAY FANTASTIC away alertly and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the
run down the backstretch from the outside of BAK TO LIBERTY, continued to battle with that rival two wide through the final turn, and wore down that
stubborn foe in deep stretch to prove best. BAK TO LIBERTY was off a step slow, but rushed up to take the lead from along the rail entering the first turn,
held a clear advantage through the stretch the first time, maintained his advantage into the backstretch, battled in the run down the backside and through
the final turn from the inside of STAY FANTASTIC and gave way grudgingly late while proving clearly second best. LOGICAL AL settled well off the early
pace while racing three wide entering the stretch the first time, angled in to save ground entering he second turn, launched his bid from along the rail
entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the inside in the drive to garner a share. ERLICH away well and was allowed to settle off the early
pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, raced into a stalking trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering
the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response late when called upon. ROOKIE YEAR broke sharply, but was allowed to settle off the early pace
while racing two wide into the stretch the first time, trailed the field in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount
a late bid when called upon. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

SNAP TO IT away well, but was bumped and carried wide entering the first turn before being taken in hand and angled towards the rail, held a stalking trip
two wide in the run down the backside, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three out from the rail in the drive to get
up in time. RHUMBABA broke sharply and pressed the pace two wide from between rivals in the run down the backstretch, continued to battle for the lead
two wide through the final turn, and into the lane, and just missed while battling one out from the rail in the drive. BLUEGRASS LENT was hustled for the
lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and through the final turn, held the
narrowest of advantages into the lane, and just failed to last. STATION ONE away alertly and spit rivals entering the first turn to force the pace two wide in
the run down the backstretch, continued to battled for the lead from between rivals through the final turn, and into the lane, but faded in deep stretch.
BOBBY ROCK drifted out four wide entering the first turn while bumping with SNAP TO IT, settled off the contested pace while racing four wide in the run
down the backside, trailed the field into the final turn, and failed to mount a late bid when called upon.

RICHARDS COMMAND away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of TEXAS HUMOR entering the stretch the first time, tracked her pace rival into
the backstretch while racing two wide, commenced her bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, took control leaving the turn, and held
ANOTHERSUNNYDAY safely at bay late to prevail. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY stalked the leaders into the stretch from the back of a compact field entering the
backside, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed willing two out from the rail in the drive to hold the place. ICE BREAKER away
alertly and stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to stalked the leaders in the run down the
backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished determinedly from along the inside in the drive to garner a share, while just missing
the place. AMANDA broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained a tracking trip in the
run to the final turn, rallied two wide into the turn, and finished willingly four wide in the drive to just miss the place. TEXAS HUMOR was slow into stride, but
rushed up from along the rail entering the first turn to vie for the early lead, set the pace from along the rail through the stretch the first time, set a pressured
pace in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn, and faded in the drive.

final turn, and continued to widen her lead late under confident handling. MERRY BLUE broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter into the stretch the first
time while racing one out from the rail, pressed the pace three wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with her

well and stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing three out from the rail, continued with a wide trip while staying in contention in the run
down the backside, launched her bid four wide entering the final turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive while not being persevered with late.

QUAGMIRE away well and stalked the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, advanced midway down the backstretch to force the
issue in the run to the final turn, took control soon after entering the turn, and held the closers safely at bay late under confident handling. EYE BE SEEING
YOU settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, maintained his position into the backside, shifted five wide
midway through the final turn to launch his bid, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to get up for the place. FOOT SOLDIER settled at the back of the
pack while saving ground at the rail entering the first turn, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the
drive to get up for a share. DEPUTY'S DANCER away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced his
bid two wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing three wide in the drive. SOMTHING ELUSIVE tracked the pacesetter into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but was outfinished in the late stages. LEFT THE BAR rushed to a
clear lead entering the first turn, controlled the pace from along the rail into the backstretch, battled from the inside of QUAGMIRE into the final turn, was
unable to keep tabs on that rival through the final turn, and faded in the late going. WICKED NIGHT broke sharply and settled off the early pace while racing
wide through the first turn, advanced four wide midway down the backside and into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.
