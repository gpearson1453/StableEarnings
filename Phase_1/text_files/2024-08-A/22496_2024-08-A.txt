Footnotes
LUV YA BYE BYE hugged the inner rail around the turn while chasing the pace, was taken to the four path in upper stretch, rallied between horses and took
the lead in deep stretch. VESELSKY circled the turn three to four wide, was five deep entering the stretch, floated to the six path in upper stretch and rallied.
KBCYA LATER showed speed along the inner rail down the backstretch, remained along the rail around the turn, eased out at the head of the stretch, was
well placed outside BIG HAMBONE inside the eighth pole and flattened out inside the top pair. BIG HAMBONE opened up mid way on the turn and
weakened inside horses. GREAT DAYS AHEAD lacked speed, stayed near the inner rail on the turn, angled out for the drive and failed to rally between
rivlas. TOP BOSS stalked the pace three wide around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way. WE B SHACKIN trailed.

Footnotes
ALL THE WAY broke sharply then was taken to rate within range and towards the inner rail, took advantage of a rail opening into the lane to advance, joined
WIN NO JOKE from his inside leaving mid stretch, dueled on near even terms and under strong handling in deep stretch and got the bob at the wire. WIN
NO JOKE broke a step slow, recovered and edged up outside rivals to stalk the pace, bid three deep into the lane, briefly went clear under pressure in mid
stretch, dug in when confronted from his inside heading to the sixteenth pole, battled gamely but got nipped at the wire. DUBAI FIRE , away a bit awkwardly,
regrouped and sped clear, set the pace two wide, was joined from both sides in upper stretch, battled past the furlong grounds then faded late. STREET
TOUGH drafted back off the pace while saving ground, worked outward to be four wide in upper stretch then failed to generate a rally. PICCOLO DIAVOLO
, off the pace and taken off the inside early on, was under a ride mid turn, shifted five wide, faded and was eased late.

BUCKIN' DREAMER hugged the inner rail throughout, battled for the lead to mid stretch then drew off under brisk urging. BILL OF RIGHTS stalked a three
way disputed pace, moved up four deep leaving the turn, had aim on the lead, lacked a serous response and passed tired horses. WITHOUT PRETENCE
saved ground around the turn, eased off the rail in upper stretch, raced between hoses in the drive and passed tired ones. LITTLE SKIPPY , three deep
disputing the pace around the turn and in upper stretch, weakened late. EL DIVINO NINO disputed the pace between horses to upper stretch then
weakened. FROSTY THE GIANT broke badly when acting up at the start then trailed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was
taken.

ANLON , brushed at the break, pulled his way forward heading to the half then prompted well in hand two wide outside the leader, took over without asking
nearing the five sixteenths, opened up after being roused in upper stretch, was given a left handed ask near mid stretch then eagerly widened from there
while kept to steady hand encouragement. JUS TOO FLY flashed speed then dropped off the pace while off the rail heading to the turn, gathered steam
when under a ride mid turn, circled four to five wide into the stretch, shifted outside a rival past mid stretch, straightened and finished well to gain the place.
SURF'S UP broke a step slow, rushed up four wide between rivals to reach contention after about a furlong, gave hard chase racing in the clear past the
five sixteenths, came three to four wide with continued pursuit in upper stretch then gave way grudgingly. BREWMASTER dropped off the early pace, made
some progress four to five wide while under a drive in upper stretch but failed to seriously sustain. VIRTUOSITY sped to the front, set the pace towards the
rail, ceded to the winner nearing the five sixteenths, was under a ride to remain a presence into the lane, kept on with effort past mid stretch then faded.
CATALINA STORM , off the pace and under a ride saving ground, steadied near the three eighths then offered a mild response. DATS TAP , off the rail,
was bumped by a retreating rival near the three eighths then came up empty. SINETIC , five deep to the half, forced the early issue, failed to kick on nearing
the lane and faded. HONORS DUE , brushed at the start, flashed speed between foes, dropped back leaving the far turn, bumped with a rival then
continued a retreat in the lane.

Footnotes
S S SINATRA vied between rivals while under some rating, was nudged clear mid turn, opened up leaving the three sixteenths then maintained a safe
advantage under a steady drive. SHAPE NOTE , with the pace three deep and under some early rating, saw the leaders get away past the five sixteenths,
came five wide under a ride into the lane and finished up willingly to gain the place outside ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE vied inside a
pair of rivals early on, angled out under asking as the winner cleared off, came four wide into the lane, chased willingly past mid stretch then flattened out
very late. GREAT IDEA broke a beat slow, raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane but lacked a serious finish. STAR SHOPPING stumbled
outward at the break, regrouped and saved ground off of a contested early pace, was under pressure mid turn, lacked a punch and faded through the drive.

Footnotes
SHIVAREE , in the two path between horses mid way on the turn, moved out in upper stretch advanced outside RUNNING RIVER in mid stretch, steadily
drifted out and narrowly prevailed. RUNNING RIVER bumped with ALBERTANO leaving the starting gate, sprinted clear on the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, came off the rail in upper stretch, drifted out inside the eighth pole, switched to his left lead near the sixteenth pole and finished gamely.
SAMYAZA stayed along the inner rail on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, altered course to the inside of the top two near the sixteenth pole and finished
willingly. ALBERTANO , jostled on both sides leaving the starting gate, circled horses four wide around the turn, floated to the six path in mid stretch and
flattened out. CAERUS raced in the two path around the turn and failed to rally. TRANSFER THE FUNDS bumped ALBERTANO when bearing in at the
break then was outrun. WAR NOVEL broke sluggishly, advanced outside horses down the backstretch, chased the pace to the stretch, faltered and was
eased.
