Footnotes
TWO SHARP coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, got given a notch and was
shaken up lightly at the three-sixteenths, went clear in hand, ducked out at the finish while prevailing comfortably on the wire. LADY PINK chased three then
two wide from the tail of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while never
threatening that rival but was along well clear of the rest to be clearly second best. PATTY BROWN EYES chased four then three wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. QUIET CONFIDENCE coaxed from the gate, knocked heads briefly with the top
one before chasing from the two path, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. SHE'S WICKED
SMART chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, cut the corner into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
FLY RIGHT raced in the three path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, made a bid near the
five-sixteenths pole, took the lead into upper stretch then kicked clear, drew off under a drive into the final furlong and proved much the best under steady
urging. SANDBORN went around the first turn in the three path, settled off the pace, was urged along in the three path on the far turn, moved out some
under a drive near the the furlong marker and finished with good courage to secure the place. HURRICANE EXPRESS (FR) saved ground for most of the
first turn then moved to the two path, settled near the middle of the field, was coaxed along late on the backstretch, went two then three wide under urging
on the far turn, came out five wide into upper stretch under a drive, remained on his inside lead into the final sixteenth then swapped to the proper lead and
earned the show. TIZ WICKED STRONG was taken under restraint early then guided inward, rounded the first turn in the three path, was reserved towards
the back, raced in hand off heels late on the backstretch, came under urging in the three path on the far turn, dropped to the two path late on that bend then
paused behind horses before being roused near the quarter-pole, moved out in the stretch and improved position. MARGINAL COST went around most of
the first turn in the two path then dropped to the inside, raced under reserve near the back, was held up behind a retreating foe into the far turn, moved from
the inside to the two path to go around that foe shortly thereafter while roused, turned into upper stretch under the crop and failed to threaten. SHAM'S
PRIDE traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn, was
driven five wide into the stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed response. TRIUMPHANT ROAD was last to commence, saved ground under
stout restraint on the first turn, moved off the rail onto the backstretch, was reserved at the rear, came under urging late on the backstretch, went four wide
on the far turn then swung seven wide at the quarter-pole, was fanned out in upper stretch and also lacked the needed response. SIX KINGS went three
wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the far turn, spun six wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to rally.
PAXSATIONAL was hustled to the front, raced inside on the first turn, showed the way while in hand, vied inside on the far turn, was asked under threat late
on that bend, lost the advantage into upper stretch then moved out and gave way. FORCED ERRORS went around most of the first turn in the two path
then moved to the rail, dropped back under urging, fell to the rear along the rail on the final turn and faltered.

Footnotes
POWER SEEKER established the front just after the break and showed the way in hand three then two wide through the first turn, settled in hand just off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked nearer to the inside through the far turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, drifted out two paths to the eighth pole when corrected and then two additional paths near the sixteenth marker when corrected once more all
while drawing clear to the finish under a drive to prevail. COSTA TERRA broke in at the start filling the space left vacant from HARLOCAP, chased just off
the inside through the first turn and steadied when DUKE OF GLOUCESTER tucked in front, chased three then two wide down the backstretch and through
the far turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one and kept on to secure the place
honors. DUKE OF GLOUCESTER three wide into and through the midway point of the first turn, tucked to the two path near the seven-eighths marker and
had COSTA TERRA steady in response, chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three
to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. PERFORM broke in at the start, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the stretch. HARLOCAP broke a length slow at the start,
chased two to three wide through the first turn, tipped four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the far turn, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TRICKY TEMPER was coaxed from the gate, showed speed then chased the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the two then
three path on the turn, took the lead under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, drifted in when put to a right-handed crop just inside the furlong marker,
came out a bit when switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under strong handling. ATHENA BEACH was fractious in the
gate then hustled from the start, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch, fought on
well in the final furlong and narrowly earned the place. GONE AND FORGOTTEN was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, chased in the
two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased the winner into the final furlong, moved out behind that foe outside the sixteenth-pole
and finished willingly to just miss the place while clear for the show. MISSING FORTUNE became restless in the gate when a neighboring rival was
fractious, raced just off the pace, chased in the three then four path on the turn, drifted out under left-handed pressure in upper stretch and tired. BANK ON
ANNA was very fractious in the gate, settled off the pace after being hustled from the gate, was roused leaving the backstretch, traveled around the turn in
the three path and failed to respond. JACKSON'S DIXIE was urged along on the outside, chased in the four then five path on the turn, drifted out while
remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch, came further out around the furlong marker and faltered.

Footnotes
FANTASY PERFORMER bobbled at the break conceding four lengths to the front when settling inti stride, raced three wide through the first turn, chased
two to three wide down the backstretch before heading four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung five wide into
upper stretch, rallied in tandem with PURRFECT GIRL, came out under a left handed crop and brushed with that rival near the sixteenth marker, then traded
a pair of bumps late under a left handed crop as that rival was under a right handed crop and was just up between barn mates to prevail on the wire.
PURRFECT GIRL struck the near side stall at the start, chased just off the inside through the first turn and then two to three wide thereafter, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, rallied in concert with the aforementioned foe to her inside, got brushed at the sixteenth
marker and came under a right handed crop and traded two bumps nearing the finish with FANTASY PERFORMER and just missed on the line. Z TRAIN
(IRE) coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and seized
command with three-sixteenths to go, came out a path in front of AMERICAN KESTREL, then continued out herding out PAY THE BILLS near the sixteenth
marker and was directed out to get a look at the closing outside pair inside that station but was nailed by both at the finish. PAY THE BILLS (FR) settled just
off the inside tracking in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and
was herded out a bit by the aforementioned foe near the sixteenth pole, then weakened in the late stages. BLIND SPEED coaxed from the start, chased
along the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through to the finish.
AMERICAN KESTREL established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go and weakened to the finish. ALTHENA three then two wide through the first turn,
chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no kick. LUNA LOVE chased just
off the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. QUEEN ROCKET
broke in at the start hitting the near side stall, then got bumped by LION'S MIRACLE MO but only conceded about three lengths to the front, raced forwardly
placed three wide through the first turn, attended the top pair in close range down the backstretch three wide and continued three wide through the far turn
given one nudge near the five-sixteenths and a tap to the right shoulder with the crop, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired while never
extended. EXOTIC CAT chased along the inside and then two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and made no impact. LION'S MIRACLE MO broke in at the start bumping QUEEN ROCKET, raced three wide through the first turn and then chased
three then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and faltered. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into
the stretch drive focusing on the first three finishers. After review, the result was allowed to stand and the raced was declared official.

UNLEASH THE POWER was reserved under a snug hold in the two path, swung six wide into the stretch while roused, rallied outside into the final furlong
and closed with a rush to get up late and prevail. GILDED CRAKEN broke out but came out in front, showed the way on the inside, was asked on the far
turn, came off the rail under the crop into the stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to get the place. JHIRSCH brushed
with a foe at the start, was rated just off the pace on the inside, came under a drive in upper stretch, chased the runner-up into the final sixteenth and was
out-kicked while just able to get the show. PALACE VIEW (IRE) went around the first turn in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the two
path on the far turn, spun into the stretch in the three path, pursued the runner-up into the final sixteenth and was outfinished then just missed the show.
HARVARD brushed with an opponent at the start, saved ground while reserved off the pace, came under encouragement late on the far turn, was asked for
his best in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. EMIRATES ROAD was hustled from the gate then urged between foes, dropped from the four path to
the three path on the first turn, was reserved between horses, traveled two then three wide on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came five
wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. AZ U CHASE ME broke a step slow, raced in the two then three path on the first turn, settled at the
rear, saved ground on the far turn, came a bit off the rail late on that bend and was no factor. TYPHOON FURY went three wide on the first turn, was rated
just off the pace between horses, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and came up empty. COLLECT
FROM IKE went three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, traveled three wide on the far turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, came five
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. GHOSTLYPRINCE went five then four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked while
three then four wide on the far turn, floated out to the six path into the stretch and had nothing left. FLASHY ALEX raced in the two to three path on the turns
and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
MAGGIE T coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside uncontested, got let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear
under a drive to prevail. FIVE TO TWO stumbled at the start and came under coaxing only conceding two lengths to the front, chased along the inside
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while just getting up for the place
honors on the wire. FOXY CARA chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three then two wide through the turn coming under coaxing
near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one, dug in and lost the battle for the place honors while well
clear and best of the rest. BIG HAZEL coaxed from the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
tired. CAROL T broke in a step at the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and tired.

lead inside the seven-sixteenths pole, vied inside on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, led into the final furlong then was headed, swapped

half-mile to run, was roused while saving ground on the far turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead in
the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and weakened but was clear for the show. MOVIN' ON UP became antsy in the gate then lunged outward while last to

wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. ZVEREV got bumped at the start
by BUTTERCREAM BABE, then got pinched out and forced to steady off the heels of NEAT due to pressure outside from CRYSTAL QUEST and conceded

came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was roused spinning three wide at the top of the stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. ARMY
OFFICER settled just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, remained patiently handled until let out spinning four then three wide at the top of the
stretch, weakened in the final furlong. BARKSDALE established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, remained in
hand until set down swinging just off the inside at the head of the stretch under threat, got collared with three-sixteenths to go and weakened through to the
finish.

Footnotes
EVALUATION showed speed then was eased back just off the pace, was well placed behind the leader, saved ground on the turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, shifted to the three path into the stretch then made a bid outside the pacesetter at the three-sixteenths, dueled outside that foe into the final
sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. GEOPOLITICS angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, went around the
turn in the two path, was asked after turning into the stretch, lost the advantage to the winner coming to the furlong marker, dueled with that opponent into
the final sixteenth and was outfinished while well clear for the place. GRANADILLA bumped with a rival after the start then moved out, tracked the pace on
the outside, was given her cue in the three path on the turn, spun into the stretch in the four path and weakened then drifted in late while able to get the
show. GALLANT GRETA broke a step slow, was coaxed along near the back, moved in around the five-eighths pole, rounded the turn in the two path, was
driven into the stretch in the three path and missed the show. MY MAGIC WAND broke a bit slow, swerved in inside the five-eighths pole and was placed
under restraint, went around the turn in the four path while back under urging and failed to respond. BLUE SUEDE SUE was hustled from the gate, chased
the pace, went around the turn in the two path and tired. GREGORIAN SOLO was restless in the gate, raced off the pace under urging, went four then three
wide on the turn and was no factor. SPIRIT OF ESTHER was urged along at the rear on the outside, went five wide on the turn and was no factor.
