early speed, made a steady gain, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SEEKING A SOLDIER raced within striking distance, made a late
bid, racing four wide, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. ROCKY BOY void of early speed, came around the turn on the outside, made a
bid, racing five wide and showed late interest. MY UNCLE BILLY lacked early speed, came around the turn on the outside and finished evenly. THREE
SEVENS showed early speed and faded down the home stretch. R AND R STAR lacked early speed and showed little. R T'S CAJUN pressed the early
pace, saved ground around the turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
ROYA unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the rail around the second turn, drove clear down the lane and finished well. SWEET SASSICAIA raced
within striking distance, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match late, but was a clear second. NEED SOME MONEY was fractious in the gates, raced
in the back early, moved up on the inside around the final turn and was a clear third at the wire. HONORARY GUEST raced in the middle of the pack, came
around the second turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was no factor. SUMMERTIME BANDIT went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded.
BAR TAP lacked early speed and raced evenly near the back. ELI'S GIRL unprepared at the start, was left at the post and never mounted a bid. BLUE
RIDGE QUEEN showed early speed and dropped back. SAENZ raced within striking distance, retreated and was outrun.

Footnotes
ALLNIGHT MOONLIGHT unhurried, racing in the middle of the pack, moved up, four wide around the turn, drove clear down the lane and won under steady
urging. BILOXI void of early speed, made a steady gain, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. GUNFLASH lacked early speed. raced
outside around the turn, made a wide bid and was outfinished for second. BRITE OUTLOOK pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and
weakened down the home stretch. WISE VERDICT raced within striking distance in the beginning, saved ground around the turn, faded and finished evenly.
IRON IN THE FIRE was an early factor, raced three wide around the turn and dropped back. LIFE IS A BANQUET sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved
ground and retreated. AFFABLE MONARCH broke poorly and was never a threat.
