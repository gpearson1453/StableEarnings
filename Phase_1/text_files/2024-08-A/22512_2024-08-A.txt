CREME DE MENTHE disputed the issue from along the inside, responded to pressure during the drive and bested RUBY RAY in a prolonged drive. RUBY
RAY prompted the pace while racing two-wide, gained the lead nearing the eighth pole while continuing to duel with CREME DE MENTHE but wasn't quite
good enough in a game effort. YOUNG LIFE LAURA was close-up early racing between horses, steadied in tight nearing the seven-sixteenths pole
dropping back slightly and then came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. ZAZEN was unhurried early, rallied four-wide into the stretch and
then went evenly late. GREASE MISSLE was forwardly placed early whilke racing three-wide and weakened. STEPUP broke slowly then dropped back and
was unable to recover the lost ground. REIGN OF FIRE set the early pace while racing three-wide and tired.

then dueled with that one from that point and proved best late. GRAMMY WINNER saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged by SPORT
COAT at the quarter pole but wasn't quite able to resist him late in a game effort. WESTERBERG was allowed to settle early, came two-wide into the stretch
and finished well for third without threatening the top two. OUTOFQUEMADO dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and improved his position.
SUBITO SLEW saved ground while being unhurried and failed to seriously threaten. FAYRUZ TRIBUTE was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide
and weakened. DERBY BOY prompted the early pace while two-wide and tired. PUTDADDYINACADDY settled in the middle of the field while racing
three-wide and gave way after five furlongs.
