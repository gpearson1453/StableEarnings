Footnotes
AWESOME WALKER stalked the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, closed steadily and wore down BOLD INTENTION to get up in the final strides. BOLD
INTENTION set the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, led to the final strides and was outfinished. BROADWAY DISH raced close to the pace towards the
outside, was carried out entering the stretch and lacked the needed late rally. WHATWASTHENISNOW raced in close early, dropped inside into the turn,
angled back out for the drive, swung wide and lacked the needed late response. BOISTEROUSLY IRISH got away well, raced close to the pace along the
inside, swung wide leaving the turn, bid and came up empty. ELDORADO DREAM was steadied early, taken outside, went widest in the drive and failed to
threaten. SIERRA SUMMER was slow early, bid off the rail leaving the turn and lacked a response.

Footnotes
GOLD EXPRESS bumped start, pressed the pace, challenged for the lead entering the turn, dueled to late stretch, inched clear and was all out at the wire.
TRUCKIN veered in at the start, was allowed to settle, bid between horses on the turn, closed steadily and was gaining late. CHECKSFORCHARLIE raced
close to the pace in an outside trip and got up late for show in a steady bid. WALKIN TALKIN BOB set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to
duel to late stretch, was unable to sustain his bid and was caught for third. INDIAN RIDER vied between horses early, fell back, bid and came up empty.
BUDDY'S PAL lacked a bid in an outside trip and did not threaten. WATTS was close to the pace early, raced inside and lacked a stretch response. BRAVE
TOEWS broke out and bumped at the start and trailed the field.

Footnotes
MONIKER vied to deep stretch and inched clear to prove best. PLAYING FIELD pressed the pace along the inside, challenged for the lead into the turn,
dueled to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. QUANTUM BULL pressed the pace, challenged for the lead between horses entering the turn, faltered late
and held safely for show. RYDERS UP swung wide entering the stretch and offered a mild bid to improve position. DAN WHO was outrun in an even effort.
AARON WHO vied to the turn, dropped back and gave way. SHAME ON ROOSTER was not a factor. RARE COIN raced close to the pace towards the
outside, went five across entering the turn, stopped and dropped back.

inside, dueled late and earned show in a game effort. SERPICO R S S set a pressured pace to the turn, dueled through the stretch and yielded late,
grudgingly. ZENFULLY ZESTY had brief speed only.

Footnotes
SHAME ON CHARLOTTE was hustled along to set a pressured pace to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. STORMY
DAME raced close to the pace towards the outside, fell back on the turn, closed steadily and got up for place while no threat to the winner. QUITE LOVELY
broke slowly, was taken outside, swung wide leaving the turn and closed well to earn show. CASUAL ENCOUNTER raced in close between horses, fell
back on the turn, bid, hung late and lost position. RAISE OUR FLAG raced close to the pace, fell back and angled in on the turn, bid inside and came up
empty late. CAYCEE'S MARK got away well, pressed the pace, dropped back into the turn and gave way. I GET STORMED was outrun in an even effort.
RUN LIKE KATE was checked at the start, raced in hand along the rail early, fell back, angled out on the turn, went widest in the drive and continued to trail.

Footnotes
O SHUGAH MINT settled off the pace, rallied on the turn, closed willingly under mild urging, drew off and won going away. DIGITAL WALLET set the pace
with a clear lead, was outclosed and no match for the winner. JASMINE BABY was slow early, raced outside, offered a mild bid only and held for show.
WILDCAT REESE improved position in a steady effort. JUST KEEP LAUGHIN raced mid pack, went widest in the drive and lacked a bid. DOM PROUD
broke slowly, trailed the field and passed tiring rivals. MARKED BY MISCHIEF settled off the pace, showed speed to the turn and gave way. SHAME ON
YOU was unhurried early while never far back, saved ground, dropped back into the turn, lacked a response and was not urged late.
