SANDRA D made the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, was set down in upper stretch and steadily pulled away while kept under urging. FEELIN
SO LUCKY , in hand along the inner rail down the backstretch and into the turn, eased out three wide approaching the stretch, took aim on the leader in
upper stretch and flattened out. DON'T TELL KELLY prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened through the stretch. VERY PRACTICAL leaned
in brushing the inside of her starting gate stall while breaking slowly, stayed near the inner rail and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
BROOKLYN GUY broke a beat slow, was nudged up four wide soon after and reached contention around the first turn, relaxed tracking three wide through
the backstretch run, bid three deep leaving the far turn, dueled under a hustling ride into the stretch, kicked clear under solid left handed asks nearing the
eighth pole, wandered outward a bit late and dug in gamely to turn away MARGIE'S FUN SON. MARGIE'S FUN SON settled in the clear and in about the
two path, moved up to the inside of a rival then angled out leaving the three eighths, circled five wide under a strong ride into lane, closed in outside rivals to
have aim leaving mid stretch, slowly gained while drifting out late and was denied. MR JEFFERSON , well placed to the inside of the winner while stalking
the embattled leaders, chased a dueling trio past the five sixteenths and into the lane, shifted out while not quite quickening with the runner-up past the
eighth pole then churned on. OMAR COMIN , nudged to the front then dropped in, was joined past the five eighths and got into and extended duel, stayed
on to the inside of pair of runners past the five sixteenths to upper stretch then faded late. AGARRAMESIPUEDES moved up to engage OMAR COMIN from
his outside around the first turn, dueled, was caught between foes from the far turn to upper stretch then weakened late. IN THE DANCE , taken four wide
early on, moved up under coaxing heading to the half, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and dropped back.

BEAUTIFUL BLOME settled within range and off the inside, knifed her way between rivals while under a hustling ride leaving the three eighths, eased out to
about the three path and moved up to take aim on the leader, sustained under left handed asks while on her left lead, wrested command leaving the furlong
grounds, switched over to her correct lead in deep stretch and drew away while kept alert. SILVER TRINKET cleared early and set a solid pace towards the
inner rail, dug in when confronted leaving the three sixteenths, battled on past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly while well clear of the rest. DANNI'S
RHYTHM rushed up to the inside of rivals leaving the chute then eased out to stalk two wide, was under asking leaving the five sixteenths, shifted in a bit
soon into the lane and faded. CANADIAN BEAR stalked the pace three wide, failed to go on under pressure leaving the three eighths, dropped in nearing
the lane, came back out past mid stretch and churned on between rivals. NANCY MARY , taken to rate while saving ground, edged up some mid turn,
angled four wide into the stretch, straightened to chase, failed to kick on past mid stretch and faded. BEASTORBURDEN , four wide early, failed to respond
leaving the far turn and faltered.

GENERAL'S DUTY proved difficult to rate behind horses, was rank near the six furlongs pole, steadied in traffic near the half mile pole and again near the
three eighths pole, pushed his way to the four path in mid stretch, rallied outside horses and got up late. CASSIUS prompted the pace outside CONTEMPT,
overtook that one in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. WICKED SECRET remained along the inner rail around the turn stalking the pace, moved to the
two path in upper stretch and rallied inside horses. CONTEMPT assumed the early lead, set the pace along the rail to mid stretch and faltered the final
furlong. BERMUDA RUN stumbled leaving the starting gate, advanced four deep turning for home, was herded out in mid stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
SPENCERIAN rated forwardly and between rivals early on, tugged her way forward to the inside of foes mid turn then waited briefly, responded and worked
through along the inner rail past the three sixteenths, took over a furlong out then eagerly drew away under right handed asking. PUDD'N N PIE broke a
step slow, corrected and advanced inside rivals leaving the five eighths, took a slim lead nearing the half, set a pressured pace around the turn, came off the
inside holding command into the stretch, ceded the lead a furlong out then gave way grudgingly. LITTLE JOSIE WALES , away alertly and led past the five
eighths, prompted the pace outside PUDD'N PIE around the turn, stayed on to force the issue three wide into the stretch, continued willingly past mid stretch
then faded. ENEMYNUMBERNINE settled off the pace, angled five wide for the drive then got past tired foes. PHOTO FINISH , three deep in range early,
advanced four wide under coaxing mid turn, chased outside runners into the stretch then tired through the final furlong. LADY CHARLOTTE , three deep
attending the early pace, was urged along between runners mid turn, failed to respond into the lane and weakened near mid stretch. BUNNY HOP flashed
speed then was rated back between foes leaving the five eighths, saved ground leaving the far turn and gave way.

hooked in upper stretch, battled gamely, drifted out late and just missed. DAILY PLANET , three wide the first turn, was unhurried down the backstretch,
advanced three wide turning for home, was well positioned in upper stretch and flattened out. SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE , taken to the inner rail entering the

CAP COM settled off the pace while saving some ground, commenced a run under asking leaving the far turn, eased out to work his way three wide and
between foes into the stretch, wrested a slim lead to the inside of JARDANI past the furlong grounds, dueled while drifting out and dug in under a drive to
prevail. JARDANI , unhurried early as a contested pace developed, moved up into the far turn, angled out under a ride leaving the five sixteenths, brushed
with CAMULUS while five wide outside rivals into the stretch, ranged up and put a head in front near the eighth pole, stayed on after being headed, dueled
and wandered outward while not quite good enough. QUINCANNON , under a firm hold tracking outside BLUE KINGDOM went after that one in hand past
the five eighths, sparred under confident handling leaving the three eighths, spurted clear under coaxing into the stretch, failed to contain outside threats
leaving the three sixteenths and weakened late. CAMULUS , away very slowly after tossing his head around as the gates sprung, regrouped and moved up
three wide past the seven eighths, stalked the leaders into the far turn, brushed with an outer rival when four wide between runners into the stretch and
weakened. BLUE KINGDOM , quickly went clear then dropped in to set the pace, was joined past the five eighths, sparred to the five sixteenths then
faltered in upper stretch. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start of CAMULUS. No action was deemed necessary

Footnotes
COAL MINE prompted the pace outside PLANET FROLIC down the backstretch, secured command near the three eighths pole and steadily drew off
through the stretch. PATTERN BET , three wide around the turn, chased the winner through the stretch in a game effort. BAD TEMPER , allowed to settle
down the backstretch, circled horses on the turn, approached the stretch four deep and rallied. PLANET FROLIC set the pace along the inner rail leaving
the backstretch, lost the lead on the turn and weakened through the stretch. KELLY'S PARTY GIRL hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased out in
upper stretch and weakened. GOLD TIME VIXEN was outrun.
