Footnotes
JAZZ WITH DENIS rated close inside the first turn, rallied to even terms at the three eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn,
cleared Hero's Man leaving the turn and was steadily handled to last. CAYENNE CREEK raced well off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, dug in to take second late and was gaining on the waning winner. HERO'S MAN came away awkwardly
and exchanged contact with Rey O Reyes then rated a slim lead in the three path the first turn, was met approaching the three eighths pole and dueled from
that point, but dropped back entering the stretch and flattened stride with a sixteenth to go. MISSIONSNINETYNINE stalked from the three path the first
turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn. ROCKET APPEAL rounded the first turn in the four path, left
the turn outside and picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, but weakened in the four path on the far turn. REY O REYES was jostled at the start,
raced in the three path the first turn and never factored. GOLD FIBER ducked out and made contact with Rey O Reyes leaving the gate then raced with the
early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
TOWN HOT saved ground well back from early contention, bid leaving the three eighths pole and steadily improved, came through the far turn about the
four path, drifted into the lane then lugged inward under right hand urging and took over the final yards. BIG BAD BRASS raced with the early pace between
horses, closed to the lead nearing the five sixteenths pole and contested the advantage off the rail on the far turn, drifted leaving the turn and dug in under
steady handling, but was caught in the final yards. MEGS GOLDEN BOY raced off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, was carried out entering the stretch and finished evenly. LAST OF BAD BOYS set the early pace
inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and was met approaching the five sixteenths, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn
and weakened. SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT came away slowly and raced off the rail the first turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened. HOLD DEM raced with the early pace three wide, stalked into the first turn then faded
leaving the turn.

ONLY GET'N BETTER settled back in the three path, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and improved steadily, rounded the far turn about the four path,
dueled clear toward mid-stretch and widened later yards. PROTA rated a slim lead inside, was pressured nearing the three eighths pole and gave up the
lead entering the stretch, but dug in the final furlong to duel for second. ANTIPOISON settled in the five path early on, challenged from the three eighths
pole and raced close in the three path on the far turn, but was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. WELLING rated close inside, picked up the chase
leaving the three eighths pole, remained a factor at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. TRANSFER THE FUNDS saved early ground, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the six path, but showed little in the lane. SEND ME ON stalked the early pace from
the three path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but flattened in the four path on the far turn. RRACE DAY WARRIOR settled in the four path early
then saved ground into the second turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but weakened past the five sixteenths.

K'S LANEE was hustled to the front and moved to the inside to show the way, raced at the rail on the turn and held on well under steady handling. VIESTE
gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn and finished well to close the gap. CARMELIZED chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the
rail and ran evenly in the lane. SUGAR CANE JANE gave chase inside, steadied at the rail past the five sixteenths pole, remained at the rail through the
turn then flattened in the lane. BUTTERFLY WORLD gave chase then flattened off the rail on the turn. ITSUPTOME raced wide. IMADHI pressured the
early pace but dropped back past the three eighths pole and weakened off the rail on the turn. ORO OSCURO was not a factor.

sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and finished well while closing on the winner. BAHAMA CHANNEL stalked inside, gave chase toward
the three eighths pole but faded near the rail on the far turn. MISTER WINSTON settled back off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. KRUG settled off the pace about the four path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
steadied off the inside flank of Top Of The Mint into the far turn then faded through the turn. VIRGINIA FULLA settled back in the three and four paths and
showed little response leaving the second turn. PYEONG CHANG stalked off the rail, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the rail
on the far turn. SACRED RIDER was not a factor while racing outside.

LADDIES SONG raced well off the pace and off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and steadily improved at the rail on the far turn, dug
in for the lead inside the eighth pole and determinedly held off SWAN, who was rated close inside and gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, took the
lead two deep midway on the far turn, bore out leaving the turn and was caught past the eighth pole, but came back when straightened away and finished
well. MALTESE ROSE settled off the rail the opening turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then flattened
stride toward mid-stretch. WAC IS FAST raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path
and passed some rivals. GRAN PATRONA took the lead into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the quarter pole, gave up control
at the rail midway on the far turn then weakened nearing mid-stretch. LOKI'S LIGHTNING stalked the early pace from the four path, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. WORKING ON IT saved ground. MISS SHACK ATTACK rated close inside the first turn,
faded past the seven sixteenths pole and was eased into the far turn. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

HURRICANE ALERT rated close inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and closed to even terms toward the head of the lane, dug in under determined
handling and edged clear at the wire. LASTWALKTOFREEDOM took over at the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under
pressure past the five sixteenths pole, was met entering the stretch and remained a factor at even terms to deep stretch before reluctantly ceding. RUN
FOR REAGAN raced in the five path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and flattened
stride. SAM WHEAT saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and flattened in the
lane. JUST A FLIRT saved ground on the opening turn, gave chase past the half mile pole and could only improve his position. THENAME OF THEGAME

LIME STAR set a pressured pace inside, raced at the rail on the turn and held well under steady hand urging. FROSTY RIA pressured the pace, raced off
the rail on the turn, lugged in mid-stretch and finished evenly. KEY TO THE CASTLE came away sharply with a brief early lead then gave chase, raced in
the four path on the turn, exchanged light contact with Spirit On The Wind entering the stretch and dug in to take third inside the sixteenth pole. ANOTHER
FINE JUBA chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail, was shut off steadying mid-stretch and flattened stride. AMELIA'S DREAM gave chase, raced in
the four path on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. SPIRIT ON THE WIND gave close early chase, raced in the three path on the turn, exchanged light
contact with Key To The Castle entering the stretch and weakened. MISS ARGENTINA chased outside, raced in the five path on the turn and showed little
more. MISS INTENSITY gave chase, raced off the rail into the turn then steadied midway through the turn. IMINCHARGENOW saved ground. TUESDAY
TOO was not a factor. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Frosty Ria for interference mid-stretch, lodged by the rider of
