HEARTS UNITED was reserved early on, raced in the two path into the lane, altered out off the inside near the eighth pole and closed with an absolute rush
to just get up at the wire. PEANUT GALLERY was bothered at the start and chased the pace early, took over command nearing the lane, was in the two
path into the lane, drew clear down the lane but was ran down at the wire. TAKE WINGS stalked the pace early on, raced in the four path into the lane and
weakened late in the stretch run. ISLAND RIDE broke out at the start and bothered multiple foes in the process, set the pace early on, raced in the two path
into the lane and faltered down the lane. MIDNIGHT BLAZE was a tad slow at the start and raced back early on, was in the two path into the lane and
moved up in the stretch drive. WAVER was never a factor. INDY'S UNIVERSE was through after a half. RUMORED was a tad slow at the start and checked
in the turn. PREYATHOUSANDWORDS was bothered at the start and done early.

Footnotes
AUTHENTIC STRIKE set the pace early on from the inside, was off the rail into the lane, under a long drive down the lane and prevailed in the final stages.
KINETIC CONTROL was a tad slow at the break, chased pace early on, came up the inside into the lane, was under a long drive down the lane from the
inside and was outfinished in the final stages. PUBLISHER raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but chased the
leaders late in the drive. INSTANT REPLAY pressed the pace early on three wide, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run.
KEVIN'S STRIKE vied for the lead early on from between horses, raced in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. RIGHTEOUS
STAR was steadied back early on and trailed the field, raced in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch. BOURBON FLIGHT was never a
threat. BRERETON'S BAYTOWN stalked the pace early on four wide, was in the four path into the lane and empty down the lane. SO SANDY was never a
factor. VADEN was done early. MONET'S MAGIC was a tad slow at the start then was rushed up and eventually spent along the turn. BLUE OCEAN RAVE
broke a bit awkward and was through early.

Footnotes
SAINT IN THE CITY pursued from midpack in the three path, gained in the five path around the far turn to offer a bid four wide bid outside of rivals in upper
stretch, dueled hanging on his left lead into the final furlong, lugged inwardly with a sixteenth to go, lightly grazeed his inner counterpart soon after, yet
straightened and edged ahead late. RIGEL dueled for the lead with an outer rival through a hot pace around both turns, dug in as an outer pair bid in upper
stretch, gamely sparred with his widest challenger leaving the furlong grounds, took light contact from that one in the final furlong, sustained the dogged
battle thereafter but was bested. RANSOMWARE laid off of the pace in the two path, closed in while cutting the corner nearing the lane, but encountered
traffic behind the early leaders entering upper stretch, remained blocked until committing to a rail charge leaving the furlong grounds, edged show while
chasing the top pair in the final sixteenth, tipped to take aim outside of them in the closing stages, sustained slow progress but needed more late. DOUBLE
YOUR MONEY leaned in at the start, tracked the hot pace along the inside before vacating the rail down the backstretch, gained in the four path along with
an outer rival turning for home, bid three wide and between horses in upper stretch, but hung on his left lead while getting outkicked passing the furlong
grounds, changed over shortly after but yielded. LEAD FOOT bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, lacked speed in the two to three path, then ran
on willingly between horses. MR. FAVERSHAM broke slowly while brushing with an outer foe at the start, saved ground towards the rear, shfited out in
upper stretch and moved up. AMERICAN RAIDER pursued from midpack along the inside, came under urging saving ground around the far turn and lacked
a response. GOLDEN BUCK stalked closest to the embattled leading pair and from the three path, chased them into the far turn, got outkicked by outer
bidders nearing the lane, shifted out in upper stretch and faded. WASHINGTON'S UNION laid off of the pace in the four path and failed to factor. RED LINE
OVERDRIVE bumped an outer rival at the start, dueled for the lead with an inner foe through a hot pace around both turns, but faltered between horses
reaching the furlong grounds. CELESTIAL JOY (GB) bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced at the rear in the four path and between horses, trailed in
the two path turning for home and got outrun. MERLOTTI was off slow and brushed with an inner rival at the start, raced at the rear in the five path and
never got involved.
