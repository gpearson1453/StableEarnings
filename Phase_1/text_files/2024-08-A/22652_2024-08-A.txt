Footnotes
KEEN CAT saved ground around the first turn then angled out a couple paths after heading into the backstretch, stalked the pacesetter to the far turn,
advanced to race in aim for the lead at the quarter pole, could not reach the leader but sustained bid into stretch, edged up along the outside, reached
SHOTSHELL deep stretch and got by in final strides. SHOTSHELL sped to the lead at the start and held clear around the first turn, set the pace along the
inside up the backstretch, turned back the bid from KEEN CAT at the quarter pole, continued on top in the final furlong then got denied by aforementioned
foe in final strides. MOWINS was forwardly placed racing two wide around the first turn, stalked the leader up the backstretch, was ridden along two wide
around the far turn, sustained a two to three wide bid through the lane and secured a share. INCA EMPIRE raced two wide into the first turn, settled in range
three to four wide up the backstretch then flattened entering the far turn, saved ground, cut the corner entering the upper stretch, gained some ground then
evened out. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

continued along the inside and finished going away. MY RAPHA was off slow at the start, lacked speed and trailed along the rail through the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn, tipped three wide for the drive and got up late for place. TOMS PROSPECTOR raced off the clear top pair in early stages,
chased two wide around the turn, angled to the inside in upper stretch, ran on and got a nose up to capture show. CASH'S PAL vied outside of BANDS

Footnotes
RUN FOR GOLD raced up close in early stages, vied outside of VIRTUES REWARD around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, angled to the rail
and finished clear under left handed pressure. ON A HUNCH raced just off the top pair in the early going, chased three wide around the turn, sustained bid
into the lane, finished with response and cleared second best. VIRTUE'S REWARD led the way by a slim lead in opening stages then took on the challenge
of RUN FOR GOLD, vied inside of rival around the turn, could not move on with eventual winner at the head of the lane, weakened but remained well clear
for show. BRASA raced off the early pace along the outside in early stages, angled to the inside and saved ground around the turn, cut the corner entering
the lane and failed to threaten the top trio. WAGON POWER lacked speed, saved ground around the turn and failed to move into contention.
MULTIFACTOR raced four wide off the early pace, chased two wide around the turn and had no response.

R F FINISH LINE tracked the embattled pair into the turn, edged closer three wide near the quarter pole, hustled along three paths wide into stretch,
gathered momentum under firm handling, took command approaching the final sixteenth and finished going away. SUPINE DUCHESS vied outside of
SHES MY KINDAGIRL in opening stages, continued to battle into the final furlong, shook free to a brief lead then got overtaken by the winner. WICKED
HOT FOOT raced outside off the early pace, swung four wide into upper stretch and finished with good response. SHE'S MY KINDAGIRL vied inside of
SUPINE DUCHESS for the early lead, battled on into upper stretch, could not match strides with rival past the furlong marker and gave way. ASHLEIGH'
BACK lacked speed and raced in the back, hustled along four wide into upper stretch and failed to respond. CANADIAN JANE raced off the early pace and
chased along the inside, rode the rail around the turn and never threatened.

IOWA CLUB tracked the pace along the inside up the backstretch, waited for a clear path two wide near the quarter pole, angled in at the head of the lane,
launched a bid along the rail, edged ahead to the lead and held firm. PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL stalked the pace in early stages, was ridden three wide
around the far turn, came four paths wide into upper stretch, roused forward to race in aim for the late lead and yielded. ROWDY RAY led the way in the
early around the first turn, took on the challenge of SUPRISE ROAD TRIP mid-way up the backstretch and dueled inside of rival around the turn, shook free
at the head of the lane, dug in to the furlong marker then got overtaken by inside running winner and weakened. DEER RUN raced off the early pace,
chased two wide around the far turn, shifted to the four path at the head of the lane and improved position without threatening. STROLLER BOY raced off
the pace, saved ground around the turn, chased along the inside in stretch run, briefly edged closer then gave way. SURPRISE ROAD TRIP hopped and
came away a step slow at the start, quickly advanced around the first turn to race just off the early leader, vied outside of ROWDY RAY mid-way up the
backstretch and around the far turn then tired in the drive. DIXIE THREE G raced near midpack up the backstretch, failed to advance when called upon
around the far turn and steadily retreated.

I LOVE ROCKNSTROLL raced inside of rival in the second flight up the backstretch, made a move between foes near the quarter pole, roused forward two
wide and gained the lead a furlong out, edged ahead then just lasted over late surging WICKLOW LADDIE. WICKLOW LADDIE was unhurried out of the
gate and remained well reserved trailing in the back through the backstretch, picked up the pace late on the far turn, shifted to the five path top stretch,
kicked in gamely, surged to the wire and just missed. MIDNIGHT RULES raced off the top flight along the outside, launched a three to four wide bid near the
quarter pole, sustained a steady bid into the lane and cleared a share. LETS ROCK N STROLL vied inside of ELIOT NESS late on the first turn and up the
backstretch, shook free midway around the far turn, continued on top into the lane, got headed by the eventual winner a furlong out and flattened out. ELIOT
NESS moved up to challenge LETS ROCK N STROLL late on the first turn, continued to duel up the backstretch, could not match strides past the midway
point around the far turn and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
BIG TIPPA sped to the lead soon after the start and held a slim lead going by the half mile marker, kept clear around the turn, saved ground entering the
upper stretch, came under a drive along the inside and held clear. YOU HAVE NO IDEA was forwardly placed and vied for the lead going by the half mile
marker, then tracked the leader into the turn, launched a rebid near quarter pole, ran on two wide into the lane, sustained a game bid for BIG TIPPA but had
to settle for clearly second best. DR. WOODS MIRACLE raced off the pace, shifted to the four path at the head of the lane, sustained a steady bid and
gained a share. HOT SHOT SHOPPER tracked the early pace along the inside, urged along the rail around the turn, cut the corner then angled out three
wide and gave way. KATELYN'S MESS stalked the pace up the backstretch, raced in contention three to four wide late on the turn then faded in the lane.
VANALEE raced in early contention, chased two wide around the turn, ran on upper stretch then gave way. ESCAPE MAP raced off the early pace, had no
response when called upon and steadily retreated.
