Footnotes
PRINCESA CELINA dueled early on from the inside, took over and inched clear near the five sixteenths pole, was in the two path into the lane, repelled a
bid near the eighth pole and shook clear then held off rival in the final stages. MISS EASY raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane, rallied
down the lane and was gaining in the late stages. GHOST PLAZA dueled early on two wide, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch
but was repelled and weakened late in the drive. TAMMY'S CRUISER tracked the pace early from between horses, was in the two path into the lane, made
a bid in the stretch from the inside but hung in the late stages. ROSARIO'S PRAYER chased the pace early from the inside, stayed on the inside into the
lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. SARISSA tracked the pace early on three wide, made a bid three wide nearing the lane and faded late in the
stretch drive. STAY FAITHFUL was never a threat.
