Footnotes
KEEN JAMES was sent for speed from the gate, pressed the runnerup to the stretch, responded in the drive and edged clear late. HASHTAG BAE hustled
to the front, set all the pace under pressure from the winner, was overtaken leaving mid stretch but held second. FOOLISH TO DECEIVE chased the
leaders two wide to the stretch, could not impact those two but finished steadily for the show. CABALLERANGO stalked the top two to the second turn,
saved ground to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. PICK A LANE FRANK ran up heels on the first turn and steadied, saved ground to the stretch
but lacked a closing bid. SHESAIDSHESPERFECT had no speed and trailed throughout. The trainer of PICK A LANE FRANK lodged an objection against
CABALLERANGO for alleged interference on the first turn but it was not allowed by the stewards.

Footnotes
MATTAWA N THAT stalked the pace to the backstretch then bid to take the lead, pushed clear to the stretch then was all out to hold GOLDEN COWBOY
safe. GOLDEN COWBOY set the pace to the backstretch, got passed by the winner and chased that one to the stretch, swung out for room and closed
determinedly but too late. ANTICIPATED drifted in early and knocked SPEEDY TOM sideways, tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch but could not
threaten in the drive. MR MEMPHIS was rank and very wide to the backstretch, eased in to save ground to the stretch but lacked the needed late response.
SPEEDY TOM was knocked sideways by ANTICIPATED in the early stages, pressed to the backstretch then weakened and gave way.

GET'EM TIGER was bumped into a rival at the start, had no speed while four wide and was not a factor. MADAME CAUSEWAY was fractious in the gate

PRINCE OF MEMPHIS was hustled to contest the pace, bore out badly into the second turn carrying GO GABRIELLA ten wide, was corrected in upper
stretch and finished steadily to win clear. TREASURE MESA was outsprsinted to the second turn but was along inside to loom a threat when PRINCE OF
MEMPHIS bore out then got outfinished to the line. GO GABRIELLA disputed the pace outside PRINCE OF MEMPHIS, was carried out to the ten path by
that one on the second turn and was therefore compromied and finished evenly. TIZ A BUDDY had no speed, chased to the second turn, was briefly in
contention nearing the stretch but gave way in the drive. Following a steward's inquiry, PRINCE OF MEAMPHIS was disqualified and placed third for
interference to GO GABRIELLA. It was a unanimous decision.

SHOT OF A LIFETIME was unhurried for five furlongs then rallied through an opening along the rail at the three quarter mark, pushed to the front then drew
away in the final furlong. BERNALINHO contested the pace, was off the rail which allowed SHOT OF A LIFETIME a rail run, battled that one for a bit then
could not keep up but was second best. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE trailed while two wide, was no threat to the top two but picked off the others and got a
desperate nod for third. PULPITS POWER was also on the pace for five furlongs while three wide, got outkicked down the backside the second turn and
weakened after seven furlongs. MASHHAD FLATS had brief early speed then tracked the pace, saved ground but was never a threat. MIGHTY GYPSY was
through after six furlongs, stopped and was eased in the stretch but walked off.

POLACCO had good speed, led to the turn, dueled TOO TALL TO CALL on the backstretch, put that one away on the far turn and drew clear in the drive.
BATTLEOF TRAFALGAR had no speed, bid three wide to the stretch then battled late to get the nod for second. RAY OF THE SEA was pinched between
rivals and became rank, settled off the rail, raced two wide to the stretch then fought BATTLEOF TRAFALGAR for second but missed. LOOKIN FOR GOLD
saved ground thorughout but lacked a closing response. TOO TALL TO CALL pressed the pace early then drew alongside the winner into the backstretch,
actually stuck a head in front for a brief period but tired on the second turn. SHESALILRUNAWAY was four wide, settled for three furlongs then gave way
after a half mile.
