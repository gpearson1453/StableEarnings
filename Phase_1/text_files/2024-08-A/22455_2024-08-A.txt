SIESTA KEY was unrushed early, bid in the five path at the five-sixteenths pole and was clear late under a steady drive. THE COUNT IS ON saved ground,
bid in the two path outside of a rival at the quarter pole, rallied inside through the stretch, had the shortest of leads late and was caught by the winner. BOSS
OF ALL BOSSES stalked the pace inside, bid outside of the leader at the eighth pole but couldn't hold off the closers. VEHEMENTLY got to the rail to lead
at the three-quarters pole, was clear in the stretch but couldn't hold off the closers. GOODMENARESCARCE and ETHICS stalked the pace outside but
faded in the stretch. NO REMATCH was forced in the at the start, then was no factor. CAPT'N PIKE raced between rivals, saved ground on the far turn, bid
at the quarter pole but faltered. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate
time.
