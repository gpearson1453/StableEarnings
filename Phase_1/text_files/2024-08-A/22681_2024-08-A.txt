Footnotes
GIVE LIFE was rated early on the inside, eased off the inside on the turn, came two wide off the bend, then closed well and surged late to get up in time to
prove best under a drive. UNSHAKABLE broke in at the start and then went up to set the pace on the inside, drew clear leaving the turn to be clear by the
furlong marker but was caught late to just miss. OK BY ME was well placed early two wide, then dropped to the inside on the turn, remained on the inside
but lacked the needed winning bid while besting the rest. SWEET AMBITION was away alertly and tracked the early pace three wide, then lugged in nearing
the sixteenth marker and faded. KATARZYNA was rated two wide and lacked a rally. SEGER SONGS was bumped at the start, then raced on the inside
and had no rally. CAVALLA was off a half a step slow and bumped at the start, then saved ground on the turn, angled out nearing the furlong marker and
had no rally. CAROLINA D'ORO was settled back early and swung wide off the turn and failed to menace. LAWS OF A NATION was settled early, ridden
along on the outside on the turn and was not a threat. GO ISHLA chased the pace three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
SEA LION was reserved early on the inside, came three wide off the bend, closed well thru traffic by the furlong marker and got up late to prove best under
a drive. WING QUEEN pressed the pace and made a two wide bid off the bend to gain a short lead, then dug in gamely and turned back the bid from LET
THESUNSHINE IN by the furlong marker and repelled that bid but then could not hold off the winner late to just miss in a gutsy effort. LET THESUNSHINE
IN was well placed early on the inside on the turn, boxed nearing the quarter pole, got out and made a three wide bid off the bend and loomed boldly but
hung late while saving the show award. JUICE was settled early, two wide on the turn, came four wide off the bend and angled out and rallied well to just
miss the show award. GREEN GODDESS was rated along the inside, then was two wide by the three sixteenths to go by the tiring early leader, then made
a inside bid but needed more late. ALICE'S MOON was reserved early and two wide on the turn, came five wide off the bend and had a mild late rally.
MAGIC FRONT was reserved on the inside and had no kick while saving ground. SET ABLAZE lunged at the start, then rushed up and tracked the leaders
two wide on the turn, came four wide off the bend and weakened. DISCO RULES was off slowly, then settled back on the inside, swung out six wide leaving
the turn and had no rally while not being asked. NEW BOOTS set a pressured pace and then dueled on the inside and faltered in the lane. This race had a
timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

outside and drew clear to prove best under a drive. HOPEFUL CURE was well rated on a loose rein two to three wide, came four wide off the bend and
made a bid but could not go with the winner while saving the place award. GOOD ACCELEBRATE was taken back early and saved ground throughout,
angled out in the lane and closed the gap fast late to just miss the place award. MEGEEZER was keen early and three wide into the first turn, then tracked
the leader two wide, made a two wide bid on the turn but faded in the final furlong. MARIANO was allowed to settle on the inside, swung out three wide
leaving the turn and made a bid but was in traffic and blocked and had to steady by the furlong marker and had no late kick. LADY ENSIGN lunged at the
start, then was reserved and advanced two wide in between rivals on the turn, but lacked the needed bid in the lane. AFTERNEATH set the pace while clear
and then was headed nearing the quarter pole on the inside and weakened in the final furlong. REBEL CONSORT was reserved on the inside and lacked a
rally. ABSTRACT MOMENT broke in the air at the start, then was rank on the outside on the first turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
GANADO was bumped at the start, settled early and was four wide on the backstretch, made a three wide move on the far turn to loom boldly, then had a
long drive and won the bob to prevail. BRITISH SEA broke in at the start and worked way to the inside to set the pace on the rail entering the first turn, when
was well handled and headed leaving the turn, dug in gamely in the drive and had a long drive but lost the bob to just miss. SPUNS SON stalked the pace
and made a two wide bid to vie for command between rivals but was outfinished. TIGGEROO was taken back on the inside to trail the field, swung out wide
leaving the turn and rallied well to finish on even terms for the last spot in the superfecta. THIRD DEGREE was steadied in between rivals into the first turn,
then was shuffled back, came five wide into the lane and had a mild late rally to finish on even terms for the superfecta. STARFORCE was reserved early,
came three wide off the turn and angled out to have a belated rally. BOURBON STRAIT was in tight into the first turn, then was between rivals on the turn
but lacked the needed winning bid. NANGA PARBAT (GB) was rated three wide early and then two wide on the far turn and weakened. SIN PERMISO was
well placed on the inside, swung out three wide leaving the turn and weakened. PEYTON'S DAY was reserved early on the outside, five to four wide on the
turn and tired. BURROUGHS CAY was settled on the inside and tired. ICANDOTHAT was checked soon after the start and then was not a factor.

Footnotes
HOLY JOANIE stalked the pace and made a three wide bid off the bend and drew off to prove best under right handed crop urging. SECURE'S HOPE
tracked the pace in between rivals on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and then proved to be no match for the winner while winning the place
battle. LIL SWEEZEY tracked the early pace on the inside, swung out three wide leaving the bend and was out-kicked for the place award. HALE BOP was
reserved early, three wide on the turn, angled out nearing the furlong marker and had a belated rally to get the last spot in the superfecta. DRINK DEEPLY
chased the pace on the outside and was three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and weakened. LOST RIVER broke in and bumped rivals,
settled and saved ground on the turn and had no rally. BELLA BLUEGRASS was reserved early, two wide on the turn and was not a threat. BEYOND
QUESTION was away alertly to set the pace on the inside and gave way in the drive. GREEK SING was slammed at the start and never factored. TAMMY'S
MAGIC was bumped and checked after the break and trailed. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to
arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
OPPOSITES ATTRACT was reserved early on the inside, circled the field five wide leaving the turn and then continued that move to get up late to prove
best under right handed crop urging. MY GREAT ILLUSION broke in at the start bumping a few rivals, then was corrected and rushed up to set the pace
and move to the inside, then was well handled and shook away leaving the turn but was caught late. RAPPER ZAPPER stalked the pace two wide and then
ran on to the wire but needed more, bested rest. BALLYHOO PRINCE was bumped at the start, then was hard held on the inside, made a mild bid on the far
turn but flattened out. ENAHM was slammed at the break, chased the early pace three wide, then was two wide on the far turn and weakened.
WRITEITONTHEICE steadied into the first turn, reserved in between rivals on the first turn, then advanced three wide on the far turn but lacked a late
response. MY WAY OR NO WAY stalked the pace three wide and tired. INVECTIVE was three wide into the first turn, made a four wide move on the far
turn but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
DIGITAL TRADE stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command, then drew clear in the final furlong to prove much
the best under a drive. SHE'S ARODEOQUEEN set the pace while racing in the two path, then was headed and dueled for command by the quarter pole,
and proved to be no match for the winner late while clearly second best. BOLD LOOK was settled early on the outside, between rivals by the half mile
marker, then advanced three wide on the turn and then proved to be no match for top two while besting the rest. DOGWOODS JUNE checked into the first
turn, then was hard held two wide from between rivals, then improved late. CHANGE ORDER was bumped at the break, settled back on the inside, swung
wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally. VALLEY STAR was reserved on the inside early, came three wide into the lane and had no rally. LORRAINE'S
WAY was in tight into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide on the first turn, then dropped to be two wide by the half mile marker and weakened on the
turn. MAS VICTORIA was reserved early three wide and had no rally. TINS steadied early, then was settled on the outside, was four to five wide on the far
turn and weakened. ENKINDLE chased the pace on the inside and tired. MRS BRADSTREET was four wide into the first turn, then checked nearing the six
furlong marker, made a mild bid four wide on the far turn and tired. RENDEZVOUS checked shortly after the start and dropped back and then was not a
factor.
