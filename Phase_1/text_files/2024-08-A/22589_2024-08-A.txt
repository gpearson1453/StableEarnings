FREEDOM TO SPEED broke out at the start and took over the lead, held clear around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to lead the way still
unasked around the far turn, came two wide into upper stretch, pulled away while ridden out then raced in hand and wrapped up late. LEADING THE
CAUSE raced two wide entering the first turn then took the inside position, tracked the leader up the backstretch, hustled up two wide around the far turn,
was no match for pulling away winner but ran on and finished clearly second best. GLOME was unhurried out of the gate and allowed to settle while saving
ground up the backstretch, launched a bid just off the inside around the far turn, saved ground into the lane and gained a share. A JUST CAUSE got carried
out by the winner at the start, was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the leader up the backstretch, hustled along the inside around the far
turn, cut the corner and steadily weakened. NICE ONE JULIO raced two wide off the pace and failed to move into contention. EYE OF THE PANTHOR was
outrun.

CHAMPION BY DESIGN was forwardly placed in opening stages, moved up to challenge WHEELER DEALER for the lead at the quarter pole, dueled two
wide into stretch, poked a head in front at the furlong marker then edged away. LODE OF BLARNEY broke sharp then conceded position to WHEELER
DEALER, remained forwardly placed into the turn, raced three wide in aim at the quarter pole, could not move on with top pair turning for home, sustained
bid down the lane and dug in to capture place. WHEELER DEALER held a slim lead in early stages, challenged for the lead nearing the quarter pole, dueled
inside of CHAMPION BY DESIGN into stretch run, fought back from the inside then got collared a furlong out and lost place in final stride. BARBERSHOP
raced up close two wide in opening stages, flattened of the top flight mid-way around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, ran on with mild interest but
needed more for impact. MO'S MOJO raced five wide into the turn, sat in aim four deep at the quarter pole, lost some ground racing wide entering upper
stretch and had no late kick. CASPER JUSTICE raced in the back although never far from the frontend, saved ground entering the lane and failed to move
on.

Footnotes
MISS PEACH was forwardly placed around the first turn, applied pace pressure to INTERSTELLA up the backstretch, matched strides briefly then led by a
slim margin at the quarter pole, given cue two wide entering the head of the lane, cleared the lead and widened under steady encouragement.
INTERSTELLA broke on top and led the way around the first turn, set a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied briefly with MISS PEACH then got headed
around the final turn, cut the corner entering upper stretch and held place. FLAT OUT STORMIN stalked the top pair while saving ground up the
backstretch, launched a two wide to three wide bid leaving the final turn, ran on with response and gained on place. PEGGY RULES settled out of the gate
and saved ground around the first turn, continued off the clear top trio while racing two wide up the backstretch, came under a ride along the rail around the
final turn and had no response.

Footnotes
CINCO DE MO raced off the early pace, hustled along into upper stretch, roused forward into closer contention then surged three wide in final stages and
got a head up on the wire. SANGRIA SKY raced off the top flight up the backstretch, hustled up three wide around the turn, sustained bid into the lane,
edged up to challenge I AM LOWKEY for the lead deep stretch, raced noses apart then got outnodded by surging rival in final stride. I AM LOWKEY vied
outside of HOOKED ON DREAMS up the backstretch, cut the corner and shook free at the head of the lane, fought back when challenged in final stages
then got edged in final strides. ROCKIN BOOTS raced off the early pace, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and improved position. HOOKED ON
DREAMS vied outside of I AM LOWKEY up the backstretch, continued near equal terms around the turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane and
gave way. MC COUGAR raced along the inside off the top flight up the backstretch, flattened late on the turn and faded in the lane. RAYS BIG DREAM
raced in the back and saved ground to no avail.
