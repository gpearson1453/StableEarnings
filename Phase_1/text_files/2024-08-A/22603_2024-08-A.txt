the final stages. LOVELY EMMA came out at the start, set the pace early from the inside, was in the two path into the lane, under a long drive down the lane
and gave in during the final stages. NO MO COOKIES was reserved early on from the inside, raced in the three path into the lane, rallied down the lane and
was gaining late to get up for show in the final stages. MAKE A MILLION was bumped at the start, stalked the pace early from the inside, stayed near the
rail into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but hung late and lost show in the final stages. LA FANTASTICA raced back early on, was in the three path into
the lane with a belated gain late in the stretch run. PAX AMERICANA was bumped at the start, tracked the pace early, raced in the three path into the lane
and weakened late in the stretch drive. EMMY BLUE vied for the lead early on three wide, was in the four path into the lane and weakened down the lane.

winner but just missed at the wire. PUBLIUS raced between horses along the first turn, was in the four path into the lane, rallied in the stretch, had a late bid
but was bothered nearing the wire. VICTORY DASH set the pace early on, raced in the two path into the lane, drew clear down the lane but ducked out late
and caved in the final stages. BALTIMORE HEART raced between horses along the first turn, was shuffled back along the backstretch and far turn, raced in
the two path into the lane, came again down the lane making a bid but flattened out late in the drive. MOVING TO KENTUCKY raced in the three path along
the first turn and chased early, was in the two path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but was bothered and checked nearing the wire. GAGLIARDI
raced three wide along the first turn, was on the inside into the lane, came up the inside down the lane but leveled off late in the drive. ACCONA was never
a threat. ULTIMATE STRIKE was through after a half. FREE RAMBLING MAN was never a factor. MISSION RIVER was done early. ROCKET NIGHT was
steadied into the stretch. THE RIDER OF MOVING TO KENTUCKY CLAIMED AN OBJECTION AGAINST VICTORY DASH AND PUBLIUS LATE IN THE
STRETCH RUN AND AFTER REVIEW BY THE STEWARDS VICTORY DASH WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SIXTH FOR THE INFRACTION.
