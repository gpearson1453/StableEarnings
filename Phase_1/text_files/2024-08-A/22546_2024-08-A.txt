Footnotes
BABA LOOEY prompted the pace along the inside into the turn, assumed command at the five sixteenths pole, set the balance of the pace and edged clear
under confident handling. GIFT OF OAK stalked the pace four wide and finished determinedly to gain second. SPIN DOCTOR saved ground and finished
with good courage. MUCHO PRIMO lacked room behind rivals on the backstretch, shifted five wide entering the stretch and had a mild late rally. KARAMEL
CORN raced outside and found his best stride late in the seven path. FOREIGN set a pressured pace two wide until the middle of the turn, kept on into the
stretch then was used up. THE MAN CAN stalked the early pace three wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
CRYO unhurried early, closed willingly three wide to make the lead nearing the quarter pole, set the balance of the pace and wore down rivals under right
handed urging in a game effort. TIER ONE allowed to settle, closed rapidly four then three wide through the stretch and just missed. VERBIER close up,
dropped back on the far turn then came on again late four wide. ORO DE MORO MORO slow early, surged to contention outside rivals before a half, made
the lead nearing the far turn, kept on the balance of the trip along the rail then was outfinished. OKLAHOMA JOE stalked the early pace three wide, went up
to make the lead before a half, battled through the far turn then weakened in the stretch. HOUSED was no factor. SIMPLY VALID pressed the early pace
two wide and weakened on the far turn. TONKAWA SPRINGS set the early pace and was through after a half.
