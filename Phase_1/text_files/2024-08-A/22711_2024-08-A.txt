MO WILLA rated outside, was ridden in the four path around the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and rallied to get up in the closing
stages. BOLD APPEAL vied for the lead in the three path, was roused at the top of the stretch, kicked clear passing the eighth pole, but was caught late by
an outer foe to place. CAN'T ZAP THIS broke slow, trailed outside of rivals, fanned out to the nine path turning into lane, and rallied to get up for show late.
MIZZ FACTOR raced in midpack between foes from the three path, took aim in the five path at the top of the stretch, and kept on, but was outfinished for
minor placings. BOSS ON THE RUN got bumped by an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path, angled out to the six path under a drive
turning into the stretch, but made no impact. I BILEVE chased inside but was no factor. SHE'S A GOLD LADY stalked in the five path but faded.
LITTLEEUROGIRL led along the inside early but weakened on her left lead. HOLLYWOODBOULEVARD broke out an bumped an outer foe, laid in range

Footnotes
SHIP THE MONEY showed the way in the two path around the turn, drew clear nearing the lane, came under a drive while changing to his right lead
nearing the final sixteenth and held sway. CHEROKEE SUNRISE brushed the outer stall door upon leaving the gate, laid off of the pace five deep early on,
gained ground picking off rivals in the five to four path around the turn, gained place passing the quarter pole, but only managed to chase the clear leader
home whlie drawing away from the rest with good energy. WARHAMMER was hustled forwardly at the start, chased just behind the leaders along the inside
early on, but lost position drifting to the three path into the turn, chased in the two path while continuing to yield ground turning for home, shifted out to the
five path while sustaining stride hanging on his left lead into the final furlong, changed over at the sixteenth pole and edged show. THE LAST MOXY broke
in and bumped the gate at the tart, saved ground off of the pace, edged show from outer rivals leaving the furlong grounds but was bested late. CHI TOWN
ROAD broke out and bumped a rival at the start, lacked speed three wide and between horses early on, pursued in the five to six path and outside of foes
around the turn, then failed to menace. BUCK LAKE took contact from an inner rival at the start, recovered to press outside of the pace setter and eventual
winner from the three path into the turn, but gave way at the quarter pole and faded. GUNNY HIGHWAY broke a step slow and shied from an inner rival at
the start, was slow to recover and lagged behind the rest early on, trailed around the turn then improved position. COWBOY CADE lacked speed two wide
and between horses, failed to sustain position into the turn, dropped back and made little impact. GOSPEL UP was reluctant to load, lacked speed in the
four path and got outrun.

Footnotes
DUTCH BUS laid off of the pace in the four path, ranged up outside of rivals nearing the lane, sustained gradual progress to reel in the leader at the
sixteenth pole and drove clear. SHAGGY EDGE bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked closest to the clear leader and from the three path into the
turn, crept closer to striking range entering the lane, but was fended off while hanging on his left lead through midstretch, got outkicked by an outer bidder in
the final furlong, kept on to spar for place in the closing stages and narrowly prevailed. PERLIANO set a clear pace in the two path, held sway through
midstretch, but was collared by an outer bidder at the sixteenth, dueled for place through the closing stages but was grudgingly bested. JOHNNY
APPLESEED chased from midpack in the two to three path, pursued behind the leaders in upper stretch, tipped inwardly in the final furlong and ran on
evenly along the inside late while needing more to gain show. WRINKLE ROAD bumped with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed four wide early on,
tucked to the inside while well back into the turn, shifted out to the three path into upper stretch and moved up. WON NINETY stalked forwardly along the
inside, chased into the turn and gave way. R D C POSSE lagged behind in the three path and showed little.

HOLLY DOLLY stalked in the three path, bid in hand midway around the turn, took command while being roused from the three path at the top of the lane,
and drew clear. CHANGE IT UP set the pace in the two path, lost the lead passing the quarter, angled out to the four path in upper stretch, and chased on
for place. POPPERINA tracked inside, was cued midway around the turn, angled out to the five path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly for show.
CANADA CANDY rated in the four path but failed to menace.

Footnotes
UNLOAD showed the way from the two path turning into the backstretch, was confidently handled rounding the far turn, came under rousing while tipping
out to the four path at the top of the lane, and dug in gamely to hold off an outer foe. WITHOUT A TRACE prompted the pace in the three path, bid while
floating out to the six path in upper stretch, ran on to sustaiin that bid into the final furlong, but was denied by the inner pacesetter to place. MINE THAT
STAR tracked inside, was roused passing the three-eighths pole, and kept on from the two path down the lane for show. NUMBER ONE DUDE stalked in
the four path, floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and flattened. FORCED RANKING chased in the four path but never menaced. PALUXY
trailed throughout.
