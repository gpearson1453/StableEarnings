TIZ VINNO rated the pace inside, was met leaving the half mile pole then pressured toward the five sixteenths, ran clear leaving the quarter pole, rounded
the far turn off the rail and was kept alert while drawing off. INTERCEPTION lugged in through the front stretch and raced with the pace two deep, contested
even terms leaving the half mile pole, gave chase toward the three eighths, rounded the far turn about the four path and dug in to hold second. APPEALING
ROAD settled in the three path the opening turn, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then eased out into the lane
and finished evenly. GONE WITH THE WYN settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far
turn and flattened inside the eighth pole. LOVE OF GRACE veered in and made contact with JACKYSINTHECASTLE leaving the gate then settled off the
rail, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, improved at the rail on the far turn and passed rivals in the lane. The latter was bumped leaving the
gate then saved ground, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. WOODEN SHIPS
was forced in and made contact with COUSIN WINNIE shortly after the start, rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole but flattened in the four path on the far turn. The latter was bumped early on, raced in the five path the first turn and showed little response

in determinedly from that point and was inching ahead later yards. MON GATEAU rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths
pole, was met at even terms entering the stretch and dug in gamely to late yards before reluctantly ceding. CASINO TRICKS stalked off the rail the first turn,
gave chase leaving the seven sixteenth pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and flattened in the lane. Z U AT THE RACES settled off the rail the
opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little more. MOONSET stalked from the four
path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and weakened in the lane. HERE COMES RUSTY raced in the
three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. SCHMEAR saved ground. BON BUENO raced in
the four path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. RUBYS FLASH raced in the five path the first turn, left the turn outside and

Footnotes
FURREAL set a pressured pace and kept the edge over SARAH'S CANDY CAMP through the backstretch, raced clear off the rail nearing the eighth pole
and held well with steady handling. The latter pressured the winner from the inside, dropped back at the rail toward the eighth pole and ran evenly through
the lane. TWO BRONZE STARS gave close early chase, rounded the turn off the rail and dueled for third. BERTRAM FLIGHT chased through the
backstretch, rounded the turn in the two and three paths then flattened in the stretch duel for third. WHALE OF A RUN gave chase, raced near the rail on
the turn and flattened in the lane. POWERED BY LOVE chased outside, raced in the four path on the turn and weakened in the lane. JLODIAMOND
steadied leaving the gate and saved ground.

Footnotes
RAMSEY settled off the rail the first turn, rallied leaving the half mile pole and took the lead at the three eighths, was urged away toward the five sixteenths
then steadily handled through the lane. YANGARRA rated close the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off
the rail but drifted into the lane and settled for second best. CROWN THAT SAINT came away awkwardly and ducked out, saved ground into the first turn
then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and flattened in the lane. FUJI FIRE settled in the three path the
first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. UNDER THE OVERPASS raced in the
six path the first turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and finished evenly.
SOMETIMES I DO stalked inside on the opening turn, gave chase into the backstretch but weakened at the rail on the far turn. BAYTOWN ADMIRAL set
the early pace inside, was met at the three eighths pole and gave chase, but faded off the rail on the far turn. KURUMI GO GO raced in the six path the first
turn and showed little response through the backstretch. JANES JENSEN raced in the five and six paths on the first turn and never factored. THOR'S LAD
rated close in the four path the first turn then faded through the backstretch.
