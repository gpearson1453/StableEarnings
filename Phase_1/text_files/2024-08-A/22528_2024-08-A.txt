Footnotes
ELLA FRANCES prompted along the inside before stalking behind the top pair down the backstretch, boldly swept past them three deep at the three furlong
pole, opened up at will while well in hand turning for home and was kept to task under hand urging through the final furlong. GRACE GIVEN tracked from
the three path, gained place entering the lane and was no match for the winner. BEAUTIFUL MANDATE broke a step slow and was last away, prompted
four to two wide into the backstretch, vied approaching the far turn, offered no resistance to an outer challenge at the three furlong pole, lost place to
another outer bidder entering the lane and safely managed show. MISSY BEE lacked speed along the inside, trailed turning for home, swung out to the six
path entering the lane and improved position. TAMARA'S WAY broke a step slow and trailed into the backstretch, moved out of last in the four path around
the far turn, but failed to factor. BYZANTINE vied with an outer rival down the backstretch, quickly weakened turning for home and was eased through the
lane.

Footnotes
GRAND PRAIRIE GAL broke a bit outwardly at the start, tracked the leading trio from the five path while many lengths off down the backstretch, inched
closer turning for home in the four path, sustained progress to bid at the furlong grounds and drove clear. OH MACARENA set a pressured pace inside of a
pair of prompters down the backstretch, got headed by her widest counterpart passing the three furlong pole, kept on in pursuit of that rival into the lane,
rebid at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by a wider rival leaving that marker and reclaimed place. STREETS OF PARIS shied from an inner rival and
shifted outwardly at the start, pressed three wide, gained an advantage passing the three furlong pole, led into the lane before meeting challenges on both
sides at the furlong grounds, and yielded between horses. VINO VELOCE lacked speed in the two path, swung from the four to six path in upper stretch and
failed to menace. AMERICAN SPLENDOR leaned outwardly at the start, prompted two wide and between horses, but weakened nearing the five sixteenths
pole. REMEMBERING MAUDE laid off of the pace along the inside, retreated down the backstretch, saved ground while detached from the rest around the
turn, yet narrowed the gap in the stretch while outrun.

Footnotes
DON'T SAY IT pursued from midpack in the two path, moved between horses before shifting to the four path entering the lane, rallied to reel in the leader at
the sixteenth pole and drew clear before being geared down approaching the wire. MIYAKO broke out and firmly bumped a rival while breaking slow,
recovered in the bit before laying off of the pace in the three path and between horses around the turn, tipped to the four path leaving upper stretch, rallied
to offer a late place bid and edged that position. HI'IAKA stalked along the inside, got outkicked by an outer bidder while tipping two wide reaching the
furlong grounds, ran on to bid for place along with an outer foe in the final sixteenth but got outfinished. GO PURPLE leaned out a touch at the start, set a
pressured pace a bit off of the inside around the turn, shook clear entering the lane, held sway into the final furlong, but was caught by an outer bidder at the
sixteenth pole, then lost place and weakened late. WHERE'S THE WINE pursued from off of the pace in the four path, encountered traffic among foes
through upper stretch, found clear sailing in the five path in the final furlong and ran on willingly. MO HAPPY leaned in slightly at the start, saved ground
while well back around the turn and advanced along the rail. DEAR SCARLETT hopped slightly and was firmly bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at
the start, raced near the rear two wide and between horses, moved up through the lane and was found to have bled. WINE AND WAVES took contact to her
hind quarters from an inner rival at the start, steadied behind foes into the turn, raced well back three wide and between horses, swung out to the eight path
into upper stretch and failed to factor. MIA MARCELA pressed outside of the leader, failed to sustain pressure entering the lane and weakened between
horses. KIMBERLINA tracked two wide, shifted outside of the top pair while between horses into the turn, drifted to the four path around the bend before
bearing to the six path entering the lane, and readily faded. PERFORMABILITY pursued from midpack in the five path, got floated to the seven path entering
the lane and tired. BAH HUMBUG brushed the outer stall door while breaking slowly, lacked speed in the five path and got outrun.

Footnotes
CAWKAB broke a step slow while last away, pursued from midpack four wide, launched a rally into the far turn, bid turning for home before forging an
advantage passing the quarter pole, inched clear into upper stretch, hung on his left lead as a pair of outer rivals took aim entering the final furlong, changed
leads leaving that station, dug in and held firm. INTERLOCK EMPIRE trailed in the two path, swung six wide nearing the lane, rallied widest to offer a bid in
the final furlong, but was fended off in the late stages. GAMETIME GLADIATOR laid off of the pace in the three path, came under urging around the bend
before altering course five wide at the quarter pole, rallied along with an outer rival to take aim on the leader in the final furlong, sustained pursuit between
foes but needed more late. GOD OF WINE broke outwardly, tracked two wide, came under urging three wide and between horses entering the turn,
challenged mildly turning for home, but failed to sustain a bid and was outpaced entering the lane, yet kept on for a minor share. FORGE IN FIRE vied two
wide, led around the far turn, but was headed by an outer bidder passing the quarter pole and faded through the lane. SCHIFTY'S HALOID broke through
the gate pre-race, vied for the lead with an outer rival, got headed at the three furlong pole and weakened. DR KRINGLE tracked along the inside and
weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
HEDGE vied with an outer rival down the backstretch, backed off that one into the turn, reengaged outside of him at the three furlong pole, rebid and
wrestled an advantage passing the quarter pole, drove clear in upper stretch and held sway. DIXIE DEVIL laid off of the pace along the inside, advanced
inside of rivals into the turn before tipping to the four path passing the three furlong pole, sustained progress to take aim outside of the new leader in upper
stretch, slowly closed in hoping of bidding in the closings stages, but was kept at bay. REB laid off of the pace along the inside, advanced inside of rivals
nearing the lane, shifted out in upper stretch, rallied whlie hanging on his left lead, gained show at the sixteenth pole and needed more late. GALLO DE
FUEGO broke slowly, lacked speed along the inside surpassed outer rivals around the turn before being blocked behind traffic approaching the lane,
continued to lack racing room entering upper stretch, yet ran on well along the inside when clear in the final furlong. ABBI FEDE brushed an outer rival at
the start, tracked along the inside, then from the two path around teh turn, chased a path or two further out into the final furlong and stayed on evenly.
BAYTOWN GUVNAH bobbled shortly after the start, vied with an inner rival, led into the turn before shifting down leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but got
headed by an outer prompter passing the quarter pole and gave way. REMAINING NAMELESS bumped with an inner rival at the start, chased forwardly
four wide, then in the five path around the turn and tired. BELIEVE IN DREAMS was brushed by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, stalked three
wide but faded between horses turning for home. BOURBONATOR was bumped by an outer rival and brushed by an inner foe at the start, pursued two
wide and between horses, then faded around the turn. KERNER pursued from the four path and tired. NOBLE SOUL made little impact from the four path.
BOURBON STATE got rank while breaking slowly, and was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
GIOCOSO prompted outside of the leader, vied around the far turn, kicked away under moderate urging in upper stretch and was ridden out.
COURAGEOUS CLAY laid off of the pace in the three to four path early on, crept closer turning for home in the two path, briefly awaited racing room at the
quarter pole, shfited out to the four path entering upper stretch, rallied to reach place in the final sixteenth and held from outer challengers. MINARET
STATION settled two wide and between horses, gained in the three path turning for home, chased behind rivals through midstretch, split foes four wide in
the closing stages and claimed show. THUBOOT stalked along the inside, moved to press three deep before bidding nearing the lane, but quickly failed to
keep pace with the eventual winner in upper stretch, vied for place into deep stretch but got outkicked and nailed for show. TURNBUCKLE stalked two wide,
pursued four wide turning for home before getting floated five wide in upper stretch, and ran on mildly to miss a minor placing. HOMER'S ODYSSEY set the
pace inside of a prompting rival, vied with that one around the far turn, proved no match entering the lane, battled for place through midstretch but yielded
late. REPEAT BUSINESS took contact from an inner rival at the start, then shifted in and jostled that rival early on, lacked speed two wide, took the far turn
in the four path and failed to factor. BOY BOY bumped an outer rival leaving the gates, then was jostled between horses early on, steadied back, then made
little impact along the inside. MISSIONARY MAN pursued from midpack tucking to the inside, and faded. SKIP FACTOR broke slowly, trailed and failed to
factor. AMERICAN VISION jostled with an outer rival early on, saved ground off of the pace and tired. MALEVAJE was brushed between rivals at the start,
pursued from midpack in the four to three path, then between horses down the backstretch and faded between rivals around the far turn.

Footnotes
SEXAGENARIAN tracked two to three wide into the turn, ranged up quickly to offer a bold bid three deep at the five sixteenths pole, led into the lane, drove
clear in upper stretch and held sway safely. ZANDVOORT chased from midpack three wide, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, rallied to vie for
place with an inner rival at the sixteenth pole, edged that position late and held it from an outer challenger at the wire. QUINTILLION broke a step slow and
was last away, trailed in the two path, swung out to the seven path into upper stretch and rallied to miss place at the wire. TUXEDO PARK bobbled slightly
and was corrected with a firm left rein at the start, tracked along the inside, chased the leaders nearing the lane, altered out to the four path entering the final
furlong, gained place shortly after, but was bested by a pair of outer rivals in the closing stages. STUNNING BRUNO laid off of the pace along the inside,
improved between horses in the final furlong and failed to menace. CORRELATION sped clear early on, met a pair of outer challenges at the five sixteenths
pole, got headed passing the quarter pole and faded. CYBERBEAST stalked outside of the clear leader early on, bid along with an outer rival at the five
sixteenths pole, proved no match for that counterpart entering the lane and weakened between horses. HASTY FLYER broke outwardly, pursued from the
three to two path around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
AGRA bumped with an inner rival at the start, trailed around the fist turn, moved out to the five path entering the backstretch, launched a rally nearing the far
turn, progressed in the four path to bid in the three path at the quarter pole, forged an advantage entering the lane and drove clear. MS QUALITY
CONTROL laid off of the pace two wide, gained in the four path turning for home and sustained her rally to reach place in the shadow of the wire.
PEIGNOIR showed the way around both turns, but got headed by an outer bidder entering the lane, fought on before yielding entering the final sixteenth
and lost place late. QUIETLY lacked speed in the three path, swung out to the six path entering the lane and ran on willingly. BIG DIG stalked two wide,
pursued within striking range between horses nearing the lane, chased and lacked a bid. CANDY BAR steadied unencumbered after the start, bumped an
outer rival into the first turn, tracked two wide and between horses, chased along the inside into the lane and failed to bid. NORISKIT NOBISCUIT pursued
along the inside and failed to menace. CLARET BERET tracked forwardly three wide, chased between horses around the far turn and faded. DIVINE
bumped with an inner rival at the start, then was bumped and put to crowded quarters between horses causing him to steady entering the first turn, then
made little impact along the inside. ETNA'S NAPPER was bumped between horses into the first turn, steadied from among rivals around that bend,
recovered to pursue three wide, but weakened in the four to five path turning for home. ARMY GIRL tracked along the inside and faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
FINSTER chased the pace early on, made a bid three wide nearing the lane, was in the three path into the lane, edged clear near the eighth pole and held
sway in the final stages. ARABIAN PRINCE raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane while making a bid, continued the bid under a rally down
the lane and was slowly gaining on the winner in the late stages. DEMOLITION DUKE was bumped at the start and raced back early on, was in the three
path into the lane, rallied late down the lane and was gaining in the final stages. COMMITTEE OF ONE was unhurried early on from the inside, stayed near
the rail into the lane, rallied late in the stretch from between horses and was gaining in the late stages. GLACIAL POWER was bumped at the start, vied for
the lead early from the inside, stayed on the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. CHRYSO ALOGO was a bit slow at the start and trailed
the field early on, raced in the four to five path entering the lane with a mild rally late in the stretch drive. B SUDD raced in the four path into the lane and
leveled off late in the stretch run. BACKSIDE BUZZ came in at the start and was squeezed a bit, never a factor thereafter. JAMMIN JUSTICE chased the
pace early, was in the two path into the lane and faded down the lane. CHITWOOD tracked the early duo, raced in the three path into the lane and was
empty down the lane. TEXAS TOWN had early speed two wide then folded up.
