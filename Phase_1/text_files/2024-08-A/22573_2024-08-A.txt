Footnotes
PROUD SPEAKER emerged from the pack to have a clear lead heading into the turn, set the pace around the bend, was headed outside with two furlongs
to go, spurted away mildly in upper stretch, fought on inside with a sixteenth left, clinging to the lead and prevailed in a photo at the finish line. KRYPTO
GAINS trailed on the fence in the beginning, improved smartly on the rail with five sixteenths to run, shifted outside to the three path to bid outside at the
quarter pole, moved in even closer outside with a sixteenth to run but was out gamed late and settled for the runners up share. TATOOSONMYSOUL
co-trailed on the outside at the half, waited in hand behind runners around the turn, found a seam by the quarter pole, quickened in the three path at the top
of the lane and won the duel for third money in the stretch drive. APRIL DE VELP broke out to begin, was checked mildly between horses when in tight at
the half, made a bold move circling four wide around horses in midturn, was in the hunt five wide straightening for the drive and finished up evenly while
fighting for the show award to the wire. PRACTICAL GIZMO was in the mix up top, vying in the two path down the back straight, was shuffled back to last
through the turn by the quarter pole and passed tired rivals down the lane. ROOKIE COURT forced the pace on the rail early on, was then relegated to a
chasing role on the fence through the turn, had no rally to offer when runners on both sides were making a move and had little to give in the stretch running.
YOGA was jostled between runners soon after the break, stood his ground in the three path up front along the backside, tracked three wide around the
bend, could not maintain position between foes by the quarter pole, emptied out turning for home and galloped across the finish line.

Footnotes
DELPHIA assumed control from the onset, loped along, uncontested down the backstretch, was let out a notch at the quarter pole to improve the margin at
the top of the lane and held safe when urged in the final furlong. SERENADING HALL tracked inside on the first bend, stalked on the rail in the third tier
along the backside, edged closer on the fence through the final turn and was gaining on the winner in late stretch but could not pose a threat at the wire.
BEQUIA was urged after the start to stay interested, co-trailed on the outside with a half left to run, began to pick up rivals three wide under a vigorous ride
midway on the far turn and found her best stride late, gaining in deep stretch to get up in the last jump for third place. ENDORPHIN RUSH tracked outside
early on, was content to watch the loose pacesetter down the backstretch, was scrubbed on midpoint on the final bend, could not reel in the winner who had
something left for the drive and faded for a minor share at the sixteenth pole. STORMY SUZIE was ahead of only a runner going into the first turn, co-trailed
inside at the half mile marker, saved ground but made no improvement on the final turn and could not get involved in the stretch running. QUEEN GYPSY
travelled outside of runners in mid-pack, stalked outside in the third flight down the backstretch travelling comfortably, was asked right-handed for more by
the quarter pole, could not close the gap on the leaders at the top of the stretch and wilted between horses in the final at the eighth pole. ZAFEATHER was
of a step slow to start, regrouped to settle in midfield on the rail in the first turn, made little headway down the backside, was hard ridden but had no impact
on the final bend and could not be a factor down the lane. ITS A BIRDIE stalked three wide near the rear in the first of two turns, lost ground to runners
down the back straight and made little impression in the late stages of the route race.

Footnotes
MEXICOFFEE pressed the issue on the rail to begin, took over command on the inside by the half, was relegated to a chasing role just giving way for a
while at the quarter pole on the fence, found more when urged at the eighth pole and resurged to edge clear for the win late. FASCINATION STREET was
under restraint while up top in the early going, hounded the pacesetter outside midway along the backstretch, took over the lead again when roused outside
at the quarter pole, battled up front outside in upper stretch, was outfinished by the winner in the final sixteenth and easily bested the rest at the wire.
NEEDS FULFILLED travelled three wide between foes along the backstretch, was shuffled back a touch through the turn, shifted inwards for a rail rally
entering the stretch and closed on the rail to the wire to be a distant third at the finish. THIS KATZ FOR REAL travelled in mid-division inside down the
backstretch, was coaxed on the fence at the half improving position into the turn, sat behind the leaders nestled on the fence around the bend and was one
paced in the lane to settle on the fringes in the end. DIXIE'S FLATTER was allowed to settle in the beginning to have one rival beaten down the backside,
made little progression on the fence throughout the turn, shifted just outside in the two path for clear run down the lane and finished up mildly to the wire,
dueling for a minor share. COMPUTER HACKER was in the middle of the field two wide between rivals down the backstretch, battled with rivals on either
side in the second flight through the turn, shifted out, four wide for the drive between horses fighting for a small share of the prize turning for home but
flattened out at the furlong marker. GOOD SOLDIER was unhurried to trailed along the backside, caught up to the pack on the outside at the half, kept pace
while going four wide through the turn, angled out widest in the six path for the drive but failed to fire down the stretch. MANETKA was situated four deep
outside rivals in mid-pack along the backside, tracked the dueling pair three wide outside foes around the bend, had nothing left to offer in the five path at
the top of the lane and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
WILD QUEENIE was fractious in the gate, settled at the rear, saved ground early and into the far turn, began to pick it up advancing willingly, shifted out
gradually on that bend to be four wide past the five-sixteenths and six wide at the top of the stretch with momentum on the leaders, gained steadily through
the stretch to drive by inside the final sixteenth. FRAC AMOUR was encouraged from the start and a bit keen entering the first turn two wide in behind the
leader, settled soon after stalking in behind inside a foe but off the fence, was close on the far turn, moved out four wide at the top of the stretch, bid taking
the lead near the eighth pole, was overtaken inside the final sixteenth and outfinished. POWAQA settled inside foes off the pace saving ground, moved out
past the five-sixteenths swinging five wide into upper stretch, kept on late to secure show honors. PLAYFULLY FRAC'IN had forward position heading into
the first turn shifting in, steadied slightly along the rail entering that bend when in tight, settled staling mid-division having moved out before the far turn,
advanced three wide on that bend, struck the lead past the five-sixteenths, drifted nearer the rail once clear of rivals turning into upper stretch, was
challenged soon after and overtaken, weakened late. PENNYJET was outside foes mid-pack racing mostly three to four deep throughout, went evenly and
made no bid. NO LAYUPS was keen to move to the lead setting the early pace just off the rail and later closer to the fence, was challenged and overtaken
on the far turn, faltered and faded. IRON PRINCESS chased three wide, retreated. STANDING STRONG was outpaced and never a threat.

Footnotes
ECHO SEVEN broke sharp, getting a flyer at the start, clearing easily from the outside post for the lead at the half, opened up at the three furlong pole when
the chasing rivals tried to narrow the margin, disposed of the only threat by mid-stretch when set down and drew off late for an impressive front end score.
CLASSY IMAGE travelled on the rail in the third flight, took the short way around while under a ride throughout turn but made little advancement, angled
outside gathering momentum in the three path turning for home and with a late burst, got up in the last jump for the runners up share. SILVER BULLET
LADY tracked the frontrunner on the fence down the backstretch, chased in vain through the turn, could not reel in the winner in upper stretch and was
caught at the wire for the place share in a tight photo. LULU'S LULLABY was allowed to gather herself, seeing the field in the early stages of the dash and
finished with good energy on the fence to be a fringe player at the finish line. OLD SECRETS stalked outside horses near the rear in the early going, offered
a mild run inside a rival around the bend, shifted out to the four path for the stretch running and passed a couple of weary foes in mid-stretch. SWIRLING
DANCER tracked outside in the early going, moved in closer to the frontrunner with seven sixteenths to go, had little left and began to weaken at the quarter
pole, drifted out to the four path in upper stretch and gave way outside down the lane. KNOW HOW (GB) stalked between rivals in the third tier, was roused
outside a runner, making little impact on the leaders through the turn, had a chance in upper stretch fighting with runners on either side for the show money
but needed more late and yielded in the final sixteenth. VERY SAVVY was situated outside rivals in the third flight, three deep along the backside, was
going in the wrong direction three wide around the bend and had no more to offer, emptying out at the top of the stretch.

advantage or on even terms, took command past the five-sixteenths, spurted clear at the top of the stretch when asked, responded to steady handling to
widen and hold sway. BRIDGE TO NOWHERE exchanged a very light bump at the start, settled at the back, began to pick it up on the turn, angled seven
wide turning into upper stretch, won the battle for place outside BLAZING SKY, who exchanged minor brushes at the start, settled inside off the pace,
shifted out on the turn coming to the top of the stretch five wide, fought for second but was outfinished. ALA TURKA stalked the leading pair mostly four
wide, asked for more at the five-sixteenths, could make no headway on the winner and offered no late kick losing placings in the end. AIRY FAIRY chased
from off the inside, was ridden at the five-sixteenths, failed to rally. QUIET MADDELENA quickly moved to the lead, set a pace under thorough pressure
from the eventual winner, came up empty.

Footnotes
FAN CLUB tossed his head on the break, shadowed the pacesetter throughout, turned up the pressure to vie for the lead between rivals in the far turn and
gamely fought down the entire stretch to win the duel at the wire in a photo. SUNRISE DRIVE shifted out to the three path, watching the lead pair on the first
bend, continued to keep a close eye on the twosome down the backside, moved in three wide outside at the three eighths marker, bid for the lead in the
three path with both his challengers inside for the drive, ran to the finish on the wrong lead and just missed the nod at the wire. AVOMAN co-trailed on the
outside, started to rally smartly, going around runners three wide on the final turn, angled out in the four path extending his stride under left-handed
encouragement, was gaining steadily on the dueling trio down the lane but could not get there in time for the win. A ROSE FOR RAVEN set the pace while
prompted outside for most of the race, was collared outside by rivals in upper stretch, fought stubbornly on the fence until the seventy yard pole and faded to
settle for a minor role in deep stretch. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION was pushed out by a rival in the four path on the first turn, was ahead of only a couple on
horses while outside in the three path down the back straight, could see the field four wide straightening for home and was reaching for more ground, having
a good late run in the final seventy yards. NONNO'S LITTLE BOY co-trailed on the inside in the early stages, was roused on the fence in the far turn but
could not offer a rally and finished up mildly in the stretch. LIFE IS HARD settled on the rail, tracking the lead duo, could not keep up with the front three
midway on the far turn and gave way between foes in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CHICAGO TYPHOON tracked on the rail in the early stages, patiently waited on the fence in the final turn, shifted outside at the quarter pole when urged for
more run, pounced on the leader outside at the furlong marker and drew off with authority in deep stretch. TEXENSIS travelled on the rail seeing the field in
the first turn, continued at the rear along the backside, began to uncork her run four wide around foes at the quarter pole, swung out gathering momentum in
the six path at the top of the lane and with a late rally on the outside, came on in deep stretch to best the rest at the wire for the place share. SILENT DIVA
was situated on the rail in mid-division in the early going, kept pace behind a wall of runners while on the fence with three furlongs remaining, shifted just
outside in the two path for the drive and finished up willingly between horses late, to close in and capture the show award. MOET MONET was taken a hold
of right from the start to settle close to the back of the pack early on, advanced smartly outside foes three wide outside horses down the backstretch, moved
to the lead in hand midway on the final turn, opened up briefly at the top of the stretch, could not sustain the rally and faded on the fence in the final furlong
for a minor role in the end. SPEED LOADER settled outside a rival in midfield, improved position three wide around runners with three furlongs to go, angled
out five wide turning for home to be in with a chance for a small piece of the prize, could not continue on and stalled at the furlong marker. CLASSIC
GLORY stalked near the rear on the rail for the first three-quarters of the race, shifted out to the three path at the top of the stretch, closing the gap on the
leaders straightening for the drive and could only pass stragglers in the lane. MOTORIN' MAGGIE tracked just outside in the early stages, was asked for
more run in the two path between foes midway on the far turn, offered little response and tired with rivals on both sides in the last furlong. BLING D'MONEY
HOME seized command from the start, set a brisk pace up top along the backside, was collared outside with five sixteenths to go and folded on the fence
through the stretch drive.
