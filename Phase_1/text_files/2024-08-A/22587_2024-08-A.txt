Footnotes
JUST ASK WATTS raced off the rail, off the pace, advanced on the turn, came wide into the stretch, angled in, rallied between horses, closed willingly and
drew clear late. CRUISING DEREK vied three wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, drifted wide turning for home, dug in gamely in the stretch run and held
well for the place spot. TURN UP THE TREES stalked two wide, chased on the turn, was floated wide by CRUISING DEREK turning for home, rallied
outside of that rival and dug in gamely to the finish. SEARCY raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane and closed belatedly. CAMM' DUKE
vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, dug in and weakened late. BET THE LINE trailed the field, raced on the rail into the stretch and closed belatedly.
SOZE steadied at the start, rushed up early on, dueled between rivals, dueled on the turn and faded. CAGE MATCH tracked on the inside, chased on the
turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked a response.
