Footnotes
GOLD OAK rated on the front end from outside, moved clear when allowed on the bend, fanned to path three for the stretch run then gradually lengthened
command under urging. ONACOUNTA in contention from just off the inside, angled out some for a clear path on the turn, took over second four wide upper
stretch, was no match for GOLD OAK in the late going but maintained control of the place. CHANEL POINT was hustled along from inside on the
backstretch, saved ground taking the bend, altered outside MIDNIGHT SOCIETY, lacked a serious late bid but gained third in the waning yards. MIDNIGHT
SOCIETY displayed early speed off the rail but inside GOLD OAK, gained the rail into the turn, did not stay with the latter and flattened out for the drive.
PRINCESS MANDII broke outward, stayed well off the inside throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
LIMA ZULU rated on the front end outside MY LITTLE TIPSY, was roused leaving the turn, took a clear lead then opened up under mild urging to prove
much the best. MY LITTLE TIPSY shared the lead inside for a bit more than a half mile, was no match for LIMA ZULU in the lane, angled out some with a
sixteenth left and was unchallenged for second. CHERNYAHOVSKIY chased the top pair from paths two or three and ran evenly through the lane. LITTLE
MIGHTY MAN moved to the outside early on and was never a factor.

Footnotes
HAND OVER MY HEART shared the lead outside FIVEO'CLOCKCHARLIE, moved ahead nearing the end of two furlongs, drew clear on the bend, widened
his lead under urging upper stretch, was kept to task to the wire and held DOMINANT D at bay. DOMINANT D gradually angled in on the backstretch,
moved clear for second just off the inside on the turn, gradually lugged in while all out the final furlong, came up short but was easily second best. ZEE FIRE
chased from outside, advanced three wide on the bend, fanned out further for the stretch run and got up for third nearing the wire. DOUBLE DRIBBLE
without early speed, though urged along, was just off the inside on the turn, also swung out some for the drive and made up minor ground deep stretch.
FIVEO'CLOCKCHARLIE displayed early speed from inside but began to steadily yield along the rail before finishing a quarter mile. CELIA'S CIRCLE
reluctant to load, was gradually forced inward in the early going, gave way after two furlongs, was pulled up and walked off.

SEMINOLE BEACH settled well off the early speed, commenced his bid after a quarter mile, was just off the inside taking the turn, took the lead inside rivals
approaching the sixteenth marker, soon moved clear, lugged in late but held sway. MEDAL OF FACT unruly in the gate, vied for the early lead outside
FASTNFURIOUS, did not keep up nearing the end of two furlongs, was two wide on the bend, swung out trying to keep a clear path outside the latter
entering the lane, brushed repeatedly with BERNIE LOMAX while still trying to gain a clear path, gained clear sailing midstretch, lacked the needed late kick
but was drawing off for the place. FASTNFURIOUS soon had a slight advantage from inside, moved clear on the turn, drifted out some into the lane and
weakened between rivals the final furlong. BERNIE LOMAX chased from outside, picked up his pace from path three on the turn, was forced out further into
the stretch, brushed repeatedly with MEDAL OF FACT, moved out some with a furlong to go and leveled off in the late going. BOISE chased from inside,
floated out into the stretch and had little to offer.

GUN IT AND RUN IT settled off the early heavy traffic, circled rivals four wide on the bend, took the advantage just inside the final sixteenth and began to
draw off in the waning yards. YOUNG MISCHIEF broke inward, bumping WILDWOOD DOROTHY, jostled repeatedly with that one leaving the chute then
with GONE AGAIN also after entering the main track, vied for the lead two wide on the turn, edged ahead in the lane, lugged to the rail with a furlong to go
and gradually wore down deep stretch. GONE AGAIN jostled briefly with YOUNG MISCHIEF after entering the main track, advanced three wide on the turn,
vied for the lead in the stretch but also did not have enough left the final sixteenth. MY SECRET set the early pace from inside, was challenged on the bend,
began to yield in the stretch, angled out some at the eighth pole when YOUNG MISCHIEF took his path and continued to gradually fade. SPEEDY OWENS
a step slow at the break, moved up between rivals, was gradually forced inward, steadied behind MY SECRET midway on the backstretch, did not keep up
along the rail on the turn and flattened out the last eighth. BRAHMS JR. raced in contention just off the inside on the backstretch but gave way along the rail
on the bend. WILDWOOD DOROTHY was bumped at the start then jostled repeatedly with YOUNG MISCHIEF as she left the chute and through the early
yards of the main track, was prominent between rivals but quickly faded nearing the end of three furlongs. SUE J hesitated then made a leap from the gate,
was an early contender from outside, gave way after three furlongs, was eased in the stretch and walked off. ZOOMA quickly retreated after the start,
running greenly, was eased and walked off as well. PIRATE MARMALADE also quickly faded after the break, was pulled up and walked off too.

Footnotes
FIVE STAR RUN vied for the lead from inside after the first furlong, moved clear on the bend, floated out some entering the lane, drifted out when put to
left-handed urging inside the final furlong but was still much the best. DRAGGING MAIN raced in contention from just off the inside, advanced two wide on
the turn, swung outside FIVE STAR RUN as he took over second into the stretch, was no match for that one but pulled away for the place.
JUSTICEONEMORETIME chased from inside, progressed two wide through the bend, gained third after entering the last eighth then could only just hold his
position late. ANUNKA void of early speed, was three then four wide taking the turn, lodged a mild bid between horses in the stretch and narrowly missed
for the show. TOWN CRIER was an early contender from outside but faded four wide on the bend. BRUCE ATTACK in the second flight on the backstretch,
took the rail on the turn and began to fade. HE GOES FOREVER was never a factor in a wide trip. BLEEDING BLUE prominent just outside BRUCE
ATTACK on the backstretch, gave way three wide on the bend. SMOOTH ATTACK broke in stride, was challenged from inside after travelling the first
eighth, did not stay with FIVE STAR RUN on the turn and quickly faded between rivals in the lane.

Footnotes
VASARIAH'S IMAGE without early speed, angled outside rivals after a quarter mile, was widest through the turn, made a strong move leaving the bend,
edged ahead midstretch, moved clear with a sixteenth left, lugged in nearing the wire but held sway. PRIMITY advanced three wide on the bend, also rallied
into the lane to vie for the lead between rivals upper stretch, was forced out briefly with a furlong to go, battled outside COME ON LADY for second inside
the last eighth and gradually edged ahead for the place. COME ON LADY prominent just outside the early leaders, moved clear for second two wide on the
turn, edged ahead briefly upper stretch, drifted out at the eighth pole, was corrected, fought for second in the late going, did not have enough left but was
clearly best of the others. TINA'S TAPIZAR vied for the lead from inside, moved clear on the bend but flattened out for the drive. LUTION soon trailed,
angled out leaving the turn and passed tired ones. GREEN GRACE raced in the second flight from inside, gave way after two furlongs, was steadied behind
SLEEPY CAT nearing the quarter pole and had little to offer for the drive. SLEEPY CAT displayed early speed just outside TINA'S TAPIZAR, did not stay
with that one after a quarter mile and faded before finishing three furlongs.
