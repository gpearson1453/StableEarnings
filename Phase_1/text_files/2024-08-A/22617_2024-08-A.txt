MADETHEDEAN'SLIST vied for the lead along the rail up the backstretch and around the turn, shook free from PREACHER MAN SAM at the head of the
lane and held late under a driving finish. MARKSON was nicely rated sitting just off the embattled top flight up the backstretch, cut the corner entering the
top of the lane, edged closer then tipped two and closed gamely to the wire. WILY WADE was forwardly placed racing four deep in the opening quarter,
continued in striking distance around the turn, came three paths wide into upper stretch and secured a share. PREACHER MAN SAM vied between rivals
up the backstretch, continued to duel late on the turn, could not match strides with eventual winner at the head of the lane, ran on past the furlong marker
then gave way. OXFORD OUTING vied three deep up the backstretch and into the turn, could not match strides with top pair approaching the quarter pole,
came two wide into the lane and faded. DO IT LIKE KEVIN tracked the embattled top flight, ranged up into contention near the quarter pole then failed to
sustain bid into the lane.

JACK'S TIME was off a step slow at the start and quickly rushed up the inside to take over the lead, set the pace and continued on top around the turn,
saved ground turning for home, roused for more in the upper stretch, responded gamely, drew off and finished in hand. F B I BOB tracked in contention in
early stages, hustled along three wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and cleared second best. BIG SWAG was forwardly placed sitting just off
the early leader, chased two wide around the turn and kept on for a share. DRAW YOUR BOW lacked speed and trailed the field, saved ground around the
turn, showed interest in final stages but was too last for impact. MAVERAMA raced off the early pace, chased along the rail around the turn and never
threatened. COLD SECURITY chased two wide in early stages then steadily retreated.

FINISH UP was unhurried and raced in the back up the backstretch, saved ground and took closer order along the rail around the final turn, cut the corner,
moved up into contention, tipped two wide, advanced to poke a head in front at the furlong marker, edged away under firm handling and held clear. AIN'T
LIFE GRAND was away in good order and raced two to three wide around the first turn, settled nicely while rated near midpack up the backstretch, let out a
notch and edged closer late on the final turn, came four paths wide into upper stretch, advanced along the outside to race in aim for the late lead but lacked
the needed kick to get by the winner. WARREN L was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the top pair up the backstretch, continued in
contention three wide around the far turn, dug in four deep just past the furlong marker and captured show. TIME GOES ON vied outside of WEARACAP up
the backstretch and into the far turn, could not match strides at the quarter pole but ran on with response into the lane, raced three wide in close range a
furlong out then evened out late and lost show. WEARACAP sped to the lead at the start, vied inside of TIME GOES ON up the backstretch and into the far
turn, shook free approaching the quarter pole, continued on top into upper stretch, got collared by the winner a furlong out and gave way. MINECRAFT
MANIAC raced off the pace, was urged three wide around the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CHARTER OAK raced between foes in the second flight in early stages, launched a four wide bid at the head of the lane, steadily edged up closer and got
up in final strides. DAWSON'S STORM was forwardly placed three wide in early stages, vied around the turn, shook clear turning for home, continued on
top nearing the wire then got caught in closing strides. ROMAN GIANT was unhurried and raced in the back, launched a four wide bid near at the eighth
pole and finished with good response. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK raced off the top flight along the inside, waited for a clear path late on the turn, urged along
the rail at the head of the lane, edged closer then tipped two wide and flattened out. BUGLER raced off the top flight along the outside, chased four wide
around the turn, ran on into the lane but needed more for late impact. LIGHTNING STRUCK pressed the pace up the backstretch, weakened late on the
turn and continued to tire in the final furlong. TRIPULANTE advanced up the inside and gained a slim lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace, vied
around the turn then came up empty in the lane.
