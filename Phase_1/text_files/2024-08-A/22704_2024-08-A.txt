FIRESPITTEN KITTEN stalked the early leaders, angled three or four wide in the turn to bid upper stretch and edged clear under urging late. PHLASH
DRIVE stalked the leaders three wide early, moved four wide into the lane to bid but could not handle the winner late. CALEB ON THE GO contested the
early leader outside MO SUMMER, continued to challenge to the furlong marker and lacked the needed late effort. MO SUMMER forced the issue early
inside CALEB ON THE GO and came up empty in the drive. JUDGE'S BRIBE bobbled after the break and failed to mount a bid. WILLHE LOVE was with
the leaders early and tired.
