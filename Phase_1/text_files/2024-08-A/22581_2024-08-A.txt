four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. PAKAS SECRET saved ground prompting the early pace, angled out to be two-wide entering the
stretch and held on for third. STYLISH MANNER was reserved off the early pace while three-wide, was five-wide entering the stretch and lacked a rally.
WISTERNOFF was prominent early while racing three-wide on the turn and weakened. GOLD RUSH DEPUTY hopped at the start to get away being the

FANTASTIC DAY dropped back early while saving ground, slipped through entering the stretch then angled out two-wide nearing the eighth pole and was
up with a rush in the final sixteenth. FIREWALKER was allowed to settle, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished fast. MISTER MAFIOSO saved
ground setting the pace, drifted out three-wide leaving the three-sixteenths pole and held on fairly well for third. DIRT ROAD RED hopped at the start then
was prominently placed while racing three-wide but lacked the needed late response. WELTON was unhurried early, came six-wide into the stretch but was
unable to seriously threaten. A VIEW FROM ABOVE stumbled start then was close-up early racing along the inside and gave way after three furlongs.
CHUCKANUT BAY was forwardly place while racing two-wide, angled in entering the stretch and tired.
