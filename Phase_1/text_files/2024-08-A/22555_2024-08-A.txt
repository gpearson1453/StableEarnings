Footnotes
GOLDEN SODA mid pack and inside, moved up through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain, edged
ahead at the furlong marker, then drew off and was kept to the task. GRAEL unhurried, circled the field through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, then
closed fast to gain the place. VILLEGAS SWING well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch,
evened and gained the show. COUPLES THERAPY mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted in
slightly and edged up for a share. BLAMEITONMYMOMMA sprinted away from the field in the early going, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then
weakened late. HUNTIN' THE RUT mid pack and outside, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, drifted in slightly
and flattened the final furlong. GOVERNOR ATWOOD mid pack and between, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the
stretch and flattened the final furlong. RANSEUR passed tiring rivals. COUNTRY RUCKUS tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch and faded the final furlong. OSBIN stalked the pace on the outside, lost some position on the two path through the turn, then
faded in the stretch. THOUSAND LOVES was never involved.
