Footnotes
CHIEF LADY broke sharp, showed the way up the backstretch off the inside, came out a bit more while continuing to set the pace turn, shook off nearest
pursuer nearing the furlong grounds to be clear, enough left to hold off the runner up in the late going. DIVINELY BOLT in the second flight early while
between horses, came out a bit to be four wide turning for home, angled in a bit and finished willingly to be getting to the winner late. GENUINE PERIL in
the second group while widest up the backstretch, crept closer to the winner on the outside early turn, floated out a by that one to be four wide into the
stretch, gradually weakened in the run to the wire. LOU ANNA within striking distance along the inside, continued one paced through the turn, finished up
evenly in lacking a closing kick while remaining along the inside. DIAMOND'S CABARET lacked speed off the inside, failed to rally. MORENA DANCER last
to leave, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
NEXT EPISODE settled off the pace in the two path and between horses first turn, continued unhurried up the backstretch, moved inside for the drive,
roused upper straight, found best stride inside the furlong grounds, steered out late, up final strides. THISNAMEISOKAY broke on top, set the pace along
the inside, rated agreeably the middle half, shook clear when straightened for home, could not contain the winner in the late going. INANNA'S QUEST
moved up after the start to prompt the winner from the outside early, chased that rival up the backstretch and through the final turn, came three wide for the
drive, lacked a closing punch to finish up best of the rest. SAKE (FR) within striking distance while along the inside, continued to save ground second turn,
moved out a bit for the drive, between foes past the furlong marker and also was found lacking in the late going. STELLAR LADY back off the pace while
racing three wide, had little left for the stretch drive. SENECA ROCKS fell back to trail after the start, never threatened in lacking a rally.

READIER away well, dueled up front in the two path, shook clear of the other speed through the turn to be well clear into the stretch, maintained a
comfortable advantage to the wire while being kept to task in a promising debut. CONTEMPLATION back off the pace and the inside, called on for run into
the straight, rallied from between horses to annex the place, no match for the winner. HOBBS lacked early off in the three path, continued to see them all
through the turn, steered widest when straightened for home, displayed some mild interest down the middle of the course to be up for the show. LORD OF
MISCHIEF in the second flight early, fell back through the turn to lose position off the inside, went evenly through the stretch. WATCH OUT WORLD broke
out, raced in mid pack early, raced on the outside through the turn, had little for the stretch drive. NA PALI JOE last to leave, continued to lack speed, failed
to rally. MR CLAUSE away in good order, dueled up front inside the winner early, was finished after a quarter, continued to give way through the stretch.

Footnotes
WORLD FACTOR moved closer after a quarter out in the course, stalked the two leaders into the far turn, went after that pair through the bend, wore down
the remaining speed inside the furlong grounds and drew clear under steady handling. NIPPY FITZ settled off the pace along the inside, continued to save
ground up the backstretch and into the far turn, moved out a bit around a tiring rival late in that bend, rallied while continuing inside of traffic to prove second
best. MIZTERGRANDCENTRAL lacked early speed while toward the inside, asked along into the stretch, steered out a bit to rally three wide, bothered late
by a lugging out leader, finished up willingly to be gaining for the place. EL BAILADOR rank past the wire the first time, chased the leader through the first
turn, hooked up with that rival from the outside to duel the next four furlongs, disposed of that same foe into the stretch, offered brief resistance to the winner
a furlong out then gave way in turn when headed, lugged out late. ANNIE'S KINGDOM last to leave, void of speed for six furlongs toward the inside,
improved by cutting the corner in some traffic upper stretch, squeezed through along the rail nearing the furlong marker then appeared to flattened out a bit
in the late going. BOURBON STRAIT four wide when lacking speed through the first turn, continued back, improved position some in the drive without
posing a serious threat. STREET OUTLAW lacked speed, passed a few tiring rivals while also not a serious threat. MOTION GRANTED in mid pack and
outside, floated out four wide turning for home, lacked a closing kick. DIAMONDHARD STONE bothered slightly start, raced in mid pack when steadied in
some traffic early backstretch, shuffled back a bit then weakened after six furlongs. THATSMYBOXER remained back throughout in failing to threaten. VOY
Y VENGO broke out, was quickly straightened to show the way into the first turn, keen while clear through that bend, dueled along the inside, had little left in
giving way through the stretch. MAINTAIN forwardly placed for five furlongs, stopped. late in the final turn.

Footnotes
WINFINITY broke back, lacked speed in the two path, angled out five wide exiting the turn, idled along in upper stretch, then launched a late surge to be up
in the waning strides. SAIL THESEVEN SEAS veered out at the break, was straightened to race in the main body while off the inside, in some traffic late in
the turn while in the two path, moved out for room in upper stretch bumping SPORTING LADY in the process, advanced and lodged a bid past the furlong
marker, led late, could not contain the winner while narrowly lasting for the place. SAFE TRUST forwardly placed after an alert break, shuffled back along
the rail in some tight quarters with four furlongs to run, regrouped and continued to save ground into the lane, lodged a rail bid with a furlong to run, also
could not contain the winner late while missing the nod for the place. SHKHARA FIRE lacked early foot, remained back in the two path early turn, steered
out five wide turning for home, drifted out a bit further, was straightened and displayed some mild late interest to improve position. RAPIDO ROSA within
striking distance early, lost some position through the turn, roused four wide into the lane, went evenly to the wire in lacking a finishing kick. DIAKONISSA
cleared soon after the start, set the pace just off the inside, faltered when headed in upper stretch. SPORTING LADY closest to the leader for three furlongs,
came three wide for the drive, was in mid pack and idling when bumped by the runner up in upper stretch, gave way.

Footnotes
CANDYCRUMBS broke back, lacked speed, continued to lag through the turn, four path into the lane, steered out widest, closed full of run to win going
away at the end. DO IT FOR MICHAEL broke back, moved up to race in mid pack, between horses through the turn, set down for the drive, displayed some
late energy to get the place, no match for the winner late. RE MARKABLY pressed the leader while off the inside, challenged that one along with some
others inside the furlong marker, could not match the top two late while saving the show. TAP THAT MAGIC back off the pace while outside the runner up,
advanced on the leader while four wide out of the turn and lodged a mild bid in midstretch, failed to sustain that effort to the wire to finish up evenly.
DADSNUMBRONEHELPR took control after the start, set the pace toward the inside, continued to hold the advantage in upper stretch then caved in late
when confronted by several rivals. THIS JUICE B LOOSE lacked early foot, moved inside, made little impact through the lane while improving slightly while
in a bit tight along the rail through much of the stretch. TOJO'S MOJO in the main group while widest into the turn, five wide early in the bend, four wide
exiting, failed to muster a rally. AUDIBLE THE PLAY four wide and between horses through the turn, remained back through the stretch. HAPPYFLYER
forwardly placed for over three furlongs along the inside, backed up through the stretch. SUMMERINTHECOUNTRY forwardly placed and three wide, gave
way in the drive.

Footnotes
OTAGO outrun early while saving ground, continued to race unhurried up the backstretch and through the second turn while remaining on the rail, switched
out for room nearing the furlong grounds and closed with a rush to win going away. BRING ME A CHECK four wide through the first turn when off the pace,
within striking distance while three wide through the second bend, lodged a late challenge but proved no match for the winner while prevailing for the place.
MY SEA COTTAGE (IRE) took control after the start, set the pace in hand, continued to rate the middle half mile, showed the way into the stretch, briefly
clear a furlong out, proved stubborn until late, also no match for the winner, missed the place. SCRIPT settled off the pace while racing between rivals, three
wide into the stretch, shifted out a bit approaching midstretch, displayed some mild late interest to better position in the late going, not a serious threat.
GRATEFUL BRED prompted the leader while racing off the inside, had little left for the drive. CONMAN forwardly placed most of the way, remained within
striking distance into the stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth to lose several positions. JUNGLE BEAST remained always back in lacking a closing
response. KOLOMIO rank at the start, was never involved.
