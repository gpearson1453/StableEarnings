Footnotes
MIGHTY LES prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, responded under two right hand strikes with the crop to make the lead just past the furlong
marker and drew clear late under an energetic hand ride. WITHOUT OBJECTION was bumped at the start, set a pressured pace along the inside past the
furlong marker then was no match for the winner while clearly second best. QUICK QUICK WHIT raced two then three wide and went evenly.
COURTHOUSE COVE broke outward bumping WITHOUT OBJECTION at the start, stalked the pace along the inside into the stretch then faded.
BLUNDER saved ground and failed to respond. LEMON DROP SHOT was no factor. FALK trailed. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and
was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

WHY KENNY WHY stalked the pace three wide through the turn, dropped to the rail in upper stretch, rallied under left handed urging and proved best in a
game effort. RIVER BYE stalked the pace four wide, rallied to make the lead at the top of the stretch, battled with the winner the balance of the trip two wide
and finished second best. WEEKEND RETREAT was fractious in the gate, settled along the rail, began to advantage nearing the quarter pole, lacked room
when caught behind the tiring leader at the three sixteenths pole, shifted out two wide, drifted out bumping SKUNK APE in mid stretch then improved
position late. INDY'S HOPE hit the gate at the start, rallied four wide into the stretch, drifted in bumping SKUNK APE near the furlong marker then leveled
off. SKUNK APE pressed the pace two wide into the turn, began to fade, was bumped between horses while three wide near the furlong marker, checked
and dropped back. SLIPOFFTHEARIATS rushed to the lead soon after the start, set the pace for a little over a half mile then was used up. THE RIDER OF
SKUNK APE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF WEEKEND RETREAT FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.
AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

BEST was no factor. STRIKE PLATE had brief speed. ITSMYLUCKYCOYNE was through early. DUDE THE LEGEND veered in at the start and was never
close.
