KAREN'S HONOR stalked close up three wide, bid three wide on the turn, dueled with FOOLISH CHALLENGE into the stretch, took over and drew clear at
the sixteenth marker. FOOLISH CHALLENGE stalked close up two wide, bid between rivals on the turn, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely inside and
held well for second. MY HONEYBUNCH chased two wide, then inside on the turn, raced between horses into the stretch and rallied mildly late. HOW
SWEET SHE IS was off a bit slow, chased inside early on, moved up three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a bid. BAILINTIN was
outrun early and closed belatedly outside. BRIGHT KOHANA set the pace on the inside, dueled and gave way.
