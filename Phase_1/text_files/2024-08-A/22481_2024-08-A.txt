STORMIN ATTILA set the pace, drew off on the turn and extended the lead while kept to task. BEAU VERO raced close to the pace, angled in on the turn,
bid along the rail, was no match late and finished second best. I'M A DREAMER TOO was taken outside, swung wide leaving the turn, bid, hung and settled
for show. AX'S BOUNCY CAT pressed the pace, dropped back on the turn, finished evenly and lost position. NOGAL CANYON broke slowly, trailed the
field and passed a tiring rival. BORNINASMALLTOWN pressed the pace along the inside, challenged for the lead entering the turn and stopped.
