Footnotes
UNCLE GEORGY led the way up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and dueled gamely to the wire to just hold the win. MUSIC BOX
DANCER bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and
dueled to the wire to just miss. HOPPY TIME stalked the leader on the inside early, swung out to the five path coming around bend, and kept on in the lane.
LUCKY DOUBLE ZERO raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter, continued around the turn in the three path and finished
evenly. SPEEDZILLA raced off the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and was empty in the stretch. IS IT WORTHWHILE trailed
the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and made no bid. UNDERRATED bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced
in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the three path and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
BERMONDSEY saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, dueled in
the stretch and kicked clear late. BEE BY THE SEA raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, came around the
far turn still in the two path and dug in in the lane, giving way late and chasing the winner on to the wire. GRAND PICK raced in the two path early, chased
the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the far turn and kept on in the lane. RELISHMENT raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, came around the second turn in the four path and finished evenly. COBBLE ROAD saved
ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and tired in the stretch.
FORECLOSURE was away from the gate slowly, raced in the three path around the first bend, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn still in the three path and faded in the lane. NOBLE CONQUEST stumbled leaving the gate, trailed the field from the two path around
the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and never threatened. THE GREAT CASBY raced in the four path around the
first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the four path and was empty in the stretch.
