IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN tracked the early leader two deep from the outside, pressured through the far turn, narrowly lead near the eighth pole and was
outkicked to the wire. CRICKET WEST settled off the early going to race near the back, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and improved position
late racing from the outside. LIPLOCK stalked the pace, took aim from the inside into the upper stretch and weakened. HIGH VIBES unhurried early on,
saved ground around the first turn into the backstretch, checked near the three eighths pole, waited for racing room briefly near the eighth pole and no final
bid. RADIANT GEM raced off the early going, was in tight quarters between near the three eighths pole, shifted out five wide through the stretch drive and
never threatened. Internal fractional times were unavailable due to timer malfunction.

ANY SUGAR HONEY showed good early foot to set the early pace, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure. BEACH WARRIOR raced mid pack
early on, moved up three to four wide around the far turn, came in deep stretch, bumped and bothered Edward Madden to check, a jockey objection was
filed by Edward Madden and stewards ruled Beach Warrior to be disqualified and placed fourth for interference. POWER AGENDA chased the top pair, had
an inside run around the far turn through the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. EDWARD MADDEN coaxed along from the outside of rivals, was
bumped, forced to checked between deep stretch and finished willingly to the wire. SAPONARA trailed early on, raced from the far outside in the stretch and
had not enough in the drive. PARK PLACE tracked the early pace two deep and weakened the final eighth of a mile. MOGALU dropped back early, saved
ground and had no late rally. PICTOR raced two to three wide around the far turn and had no response.

Footnotes
OUR ETHAN CHARLES prompt the early leaders from the outside, raced three wide around the far turn and edged away under strong handling. PRINCE
OF CHILL was off slowly, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, moved up patiently through the far turn, waited briefly for racing room near the
three sixteenths pole and finished gamely to the wire. SANDY'S REFUGEE stalked the pace, raced four wide around the far turn and finished willingly to the
wire. DIRTY HARRY pressed the early going between rivals and weakened the final eighth of a mile. SEPARATE WAYS vied for the early lead along the
inside and gave way. FIRST SQUAD raced four wide near the quarter pole and lacked a rally. NINJA KITTY dropped back early on and failed to respond.
SHARP STYLE raced five wide around the far turn and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
OUR UPTOWN GIRL dropped back off the early pace, moved up five to six wide into the upper stretch and finished gamely to prevail under all out pressure.
NORMANDY LIFE stalked the pace, was blocked approaching the eighth pole, angled out and missed in a game effort. JACK'S LILLY settled off the early
going, raced from the far outside in the stretch and close in belatedly. ARUMA pressed the early pace between rivals and weakened the final sixteenth of a
mile. VALIANT MAJESTY pressed outside foes and faded in the drive. NEVER SO LUCKY (IRE) bobbled at the start, saved ground around the far turn into
the stretch and lacked a bid. DWELLER was off slow, rushed up to vie near the rail and faded. NOISY ON THE BAY failed to respond.

Footnotes
ALVY settled off the early going, advanced into the far turn, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and finished well to get up under strong pressure.
IRISH HONOR coaxed along nearing the three eighths pole, continued its inside bid past the quarter pole, angled out through the drive and finished gamely
to the wire. AMPERSAND tracked two deep, led deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. MR PHIL set all the pace from the inside and weakened the final
eighth of a mile. EYE ON THE CANDY unhurried early, made a four wide move to take aim near the quarter pole and flattened out. DALTON raced five wide
around the first turn, coaxed from the outside of rivals down the backstretch and tired.

Footnotes
LORD WINSALOT rated along the inside, dug in late and prevailed under strong handling. GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS broke awkwardly, made a four wide
move near the quarter pole and missed in a game effort. MUCHO MACHO EDDIE stalked the pace, ridden along two deep near the quarter pole, angled out
six deep and finished willingly to the wire. THE TWINS SNEAKERS dropped back to trail early, raced four wide near the quarter pole and moved up racing
from the far outside. CAJUN OCCASION stalked the pace, raced three wide near the quarter pole and weakened while racing between rivals. OVER AND
THUNDER set a pressured early pace and faded. PURPLE SHIRT was allowed to settle early and failed to respond. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL stalked the
pace from the outside of rivals and stopped.
