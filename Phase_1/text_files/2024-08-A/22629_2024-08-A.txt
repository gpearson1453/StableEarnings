was up for place. HIT THAT REVIEW (IRE) was unhurried early on from the rail, darted out into the four path entering the lane, made a bid four wide near
the eighth pole, was bumped nearing the sixteenth pole and missed place in the final stages. ART FAIR tracked the pace early while three wide, was in the
three path into the lane, made a bid three wide near the eighth pole, was bumped nearing the sixteenth pole and weakened late in the drive. PERFECT

the sixteenth pole and hung in the late stages. SAND CAST was steadied along early with no late gain in the stretch run. LUMBER LEGACY was a tad slow
at the break and trailed the field early on, raced in the three path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. RADARMAN had early speed from
between horses then folded up. GARDINER was done early. SO GRAND was a bit slow at the start and through after a half.

into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. CHISELER raced back early on while three wide, was in the six path into the lane and moved up late in
the stretch drive. RUNNIN' ROCKET raced back early on from between horses, was in the four path into the lane, steadied in the upper stretch and leveled

MOST WANTED set the pace from the outset, raced off the rail into the lane, inched clear down the lane and lasted at the wire. NOT THIS BOY stalked the
pace early on, raced in the three path into the lane, was under a long bid down the lane while gaining and just missed at the wire. WHO DEY stumbled at
the start and trailed the field early on, raced in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane with a late bid but did not have enough in the final stages.
NATIVE LAND tracked the pace early on three wide, was in the four path into the lane while making a bid but faded late in the drive. STRETCH RIDE hit the
gate and almost lost the rider at the start, tracked the pace early on, raced in the two path into the lane and was empty down the lane.

Footnotes
PIGALLE came out at the start, was reserved early on, raced in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane and edged past four wide in the final stages.
FANCY bobbled at the start and raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid four wide near the eighth pole and just missed at the
wire. MYSTIC PLEASURE set the pace early on, raced in the two path into the lane, was under a long drive down the lane, led late but yielded in the final
stages. MUSICAL MISCHIEF was bumped at the start, tracked the pace early from between horses, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid near the
eighth pole but weakened late in the drive. TAXED was well placed early on from the inside, stayed near the rail into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but
weakened late in the drive. HIDDEN CONNECTION stalked the pace early on, raced in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch run.
MAGICAL LUTE was never a threat. JERSEY PEARL tracked the pace early on from the outside, was in the four path into the lane and empty down the
lane.
