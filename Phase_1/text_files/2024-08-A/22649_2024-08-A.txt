the early leaders and was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. FAJARDO was hustled early and had a clear
lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. THE SWAYZE EXPRESS was in range and saved ground on the turn but from
the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. PERSEVERE was off the pace and roused on the turn but had no response. DISCOVERY CHART was
well back and moved up on the turn but was not a factor. MOMENT OF ZEN was up close early but lost ground on the turn and from the five path at the top
of the stretch was empty.

the far turn and had the lead from the three path in mid stretch but was outgunned. CALM COOL tracked the early leaders and had the lead on the far turn
but gave way at the top of the stretch. I'M PHANTOM was in range and hustled along on the far turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch needed
more. SILENT PRINCESS was in range and roused on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. TACHYON SPEED was
off the pace and had a mild gain on the far turn but had no impact. KINDOFBLUEKITTEN stalked the early leader and had a good position on the far turn

Footnotes
SEEDS OF GRANDEUR was well back, trailed the field on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up in time. EMERALD LAKE
stalked the early leader and was a factor on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. SWEET SERENADE was off the
pace and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. PLUIE D'AVRIL was in mid pack and raced evenly
from the inside on the far turn but needed more in deep stretch. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN was in touch and roused on the far turn but from the four path at
the top of the stretch leveled off. CHROME'S BIG BREAK set the pace and had a clear lead on the far turn but was headed in mid stretch and had nothing
left. BRIENNE OF TARTH was unhurried early and saved ground on the far turn but was not a factor.
