OLIVIA DEE settled off the early going racing in hand, moved up through the far turn, raced four wide into the upper stretch and finished strongly to draw
clear under steady pressure. AMERICAN PEACHES was allowed to settle early, raced two deep near the quarter pole and finished well to rally for the place
position racing four deep through the lane. MERRYCHILL stalked the pace, raced from the inside past the quarter pole and had no final winning bid in the
drive. LAVINIA SPIRIT dueled two deep and weakened the final eighth of a mile. HOP ON ME lunged break, void of early speed, raced six wide into the
upper stretch and had not enough. UPTOWN CHARLY GIRL failed to sustain a bid. AUNT JO raced four wide around the far turn and never was a factor.
BREEZY DANCE dueled from the inside and stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
HORNBEAM settled off the early pace, advanced from the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch, shifted out three deep and finished well to draw
clear under steady pressure. DALTON showed good early speed, cleared off well around the far turn, clear nearing the eighth pole but was no match for the
winner late. GURT'S WARRIOR raced five wide around the first turn, stalked the pace from the outside down the backstretch, raced four deep around the
far turn and kept on to the wire. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY was unhurried early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and moved up through the drive to
improve position. DESANTIS dropped back to race mid pack, was three deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. GHOST
STALKER raced six deep into the upper lane and had no late rally. LORD WINSALOT stalked the pace from the inside and faded. CRYPT void of early
speed, saved ground and never threatened. BARLEEWON dropped back early and failed to respond. GRAB THE GOLD coaxed two deep and was done
early.

and kept on in game effort to just miss. FINANCIAL STRENGTH coaxed along early racing mid pack, raced six to seven wide into the upper lane and
moved up to improve position. CITIZEN MACK raced three deep around the far turn and had no final winning bid. TIZ SPEEDY void of early speed, raced

SHE'S GOT GAME stumbled at the break and unseated his jockey. Stewards reviewed start and no change.
