Footnotes
SASSY NATURE brushed by FAST BUCK at the start, grabbed the lead from inside, drew away on the turn, led well clear into the final furlong and held
safely under right handed urging. DANIEL'S MAGIC tracked outside a rival, rounded the bend two to three wide, finished determinedly late and closed the
gap on the winner. UNCONQUERABLE KEEN (IRE) stalked outside a rival, went three wide into the turn then moved into the two path, closest in pursuit
entering the lane, lacked a bid in the late stages but kept on to hold third. FAST BUCK broke in and brushed the winner to come away slow, ran up on heels
and had to pause early, raced near the inside then angled out to the three path, steered out further midstretch and missed third. BEER CAN MAN sat off the
pace and moved inside, tipped two wide into the lane and lacked a rally. MAN O ROSE stalked the lone leader inside a rival, drifted out a bit at the quarter
pole but was corrected quickly to remain inside, then weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
SKY SAILING away quickly to grab the lead then vied outside a pair of rivals, dueled outside ANNIE FOX while in the three path past the five-sixteenths
pole, put that rival away entering the lane, asked right handed at the eighth pole then switched to the left shortly after and drew off under strong handling.
ANNIE FOX vied for the lead inside pair of rivals, dueled with SKY SAILING approaching the quarter pole, yielded to that rival entering the lane and stayed
on to secure second. DIXIE BLAZE pressed the pace between rivals to the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up with the top pair and chased two wide
into the lane, flattened in the lane but was able to hold third. LADY QUICKSAND broke out, forwardly placed under coaxing, traveled three then four wide on
the turn, then failed to rally in the lane. IN WITHOUT KNOCKIN stumbled slightly leaving the gate, sat off the pace after, took the turn four to five wide and
failed to menace. VEGAS CHARM off slow to begin, traveled near the back, went two then three wide on the turn and could not make an impact. ROSES N'
CHROME off slow and shifted out in the beginning, trailed off the rail then started to climb leaving the backstretch, drifted out wide on the turn and could not
threaten. KISSES REQUIRED off slow from inside, climbed while in range early, chased along the rail then moved into the two path and tired.

Footnotes
ARTISLAS settled outside a rival, angled in and gained through the turn, swung out into the lane, rallied five deep into the final sixteenth and drove clear to
prove best. CAJUN GOLD broke in and bumped, stalked from inside, needed room in upper stretch, bid between rivals in the furlong grounds but got
outkicked by the winner. SCIPIO off slow to begin, trailed outside a rival, took the turn two wide, steered out in upper stretch and closed well. IRON MAN
CAL stalked the top pair two wide, ridden along around the bend, tipped out in upper stretch, bid four deep and got outkicked. PALI KITTEN dueled up the
backstretch then pressed from outside into and around the bend, fought to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. KALE'S ANGEL dueled from inside then
inched ahead leaving the backstretch, maintained a short lead through the turn, dug in to the sixteenth pole and folded late. WESTWOOD broke a step
slow, traveled inside a rival at the back, got boxed in briefly early on the turn, tipped two wide and was never a factor. KARANTHOS took a bump in the
early stages, laid off the pace and steered to the rail, lost positions on the turn and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
NORMANDY QUEEN took command early and led wide into the first turn before cutting over to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch, remained
clear to the stretch, asked left then right handed in the furlong grounds and gamely prevailed. WELL FUNDED settled inside, roused into range on the far
turn, tipped out and took aim at NORMANDY QUEEN in the lane, finished gamely to draw alongside the winner late but was not enough. PETITE ANGE
raced in range from inside then two wide into the backstretch, traveled between foes on the far turn before angling four wide approaching the stretch,
chased within striking distance at the furlong marker but flattened in deep stretch. ONE SUMMER DAY prominent early then had to take up when
NORMANDY QUEEN angled inward at the seven-eighths pole, stalked from inside, roused at the quarter pole, tipped two wide leaving the bend and
weakened. MIZZYAAN broke a step slow, trailed two wide into the first turn then moved out a bit around the bend, taken out wider in the middle stages,
chased five deep at the quarter pole and offered a mild response to improve positions. FIRE BAN chased three deep around the first turn, remained outside
rivals up the backstretch, had to pause in traffic four deep at the quarter pole, kept trying down the lane and improved placings. TAHITI ITI chased from the
three path on the clubhouse turn, two then three wide on the second bend and could not make an impact. VIBEZ raced up close outside the leader while
wide into the first turn then angled inward, closest in pursuit up the backstretch, roused at the three-eighths pole, spun three wide into the lane and faded.
HYMNAL chased between rivals from the two path early, moved inside in the middle stages, found traffic at the five-sixteenths pole, hugged the rail to the
stretch and failed to menace. SHE'S NO ANGEL traveled four then three deep out of range early, drew closer up the backstretch, asked three to four wide
on the far turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
KETONIA (FR) reserved along the inside, ran up on heels and checked into the far turn, tipped out and took aim four wide leaving the bend, kicked clear in
upper stretch and was ridden out to the wire. CAMERON SLOUGH trailed three deep into the first turn then dropped back a bit and moved into the two path,
trailed up the backstretch, ran up on heels briefly at the three-eighths pole, split foes midway around the bend, entered the lane three wide and edged
PRECIPICE for second. PRECIPICE traveled two wide near the back, went three wide into the far turn, eased out and raced five wide into the lane, kept
trying down the stretch but got edged for second. ANG N ASH stalked from inside, waited two wide late on the far turn, continued to lack room in upper
stretch, then gained a clear path, moved inward and kept on for a minor award. CERTITUDE (FR) stalked outside a rival, bid three deep a quarter mile out
but flattened in the furlong grounds. PRINCESS MIDNIGHT pressed three deep early, took over past the half-mile pole, dueled two wide around the far turn
and weakened down the lane. STRIKINGLY vied between rivals early taking a slim lead, lost command past the half-mile pole, could not keep pace with the
top pair into the far turn, dropped back around the bend and tired. MARINAS TINA (IRE) vied for the lead inside pair of rivals to upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
CURLIN'S KAOS set the pace up the backstretch under pressure from DONNIE THE CHIRO to the outside, cleared that rival into the turn, coaxed along
from inside then set down leaving the bend, asked right handed then switched to the left in deep stretch and widened to the wire. PURE MADNESS antsy in
the gate, bumped at the start, moved out and chased between rivals, traveled three wide then was closest in pursuit two wide into the stretch, could not
make any headway on the winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. SHADY TIGER tracked five deep into the turn, asked right handed leaving
the bend, spun four wide into the lane and lacked rally. TEQUILA TALKIN stalked inside rivals early on, lost ground from the rail around the bend, churned
on through the stretch and rounded out the superfecta. CAPO LUIGI climbed early chasing off the pace, took the turn four wide and improved position.
FINAL STORM sat off the pace, went two wide on the turn, ridden along between foes then in the two path and lacked the needed response when called
upon. MIO BAMBINO bumped with inner rival to come away slow, climbed early chasing off the rail, took the turn two to three wide and improved placings.
DONNIE THE CHIRO pressed from outside up the backstretch, could not keep up with the winner into the turn, driven two wide into the stretch and had little
left for the drive. STAY ON THE FENCE unhurried in the early going, saved ground around the bend and was roused past the quarter pole, cut the corner
into the stretch and failed to make an impact. PRINCE PRANCEALOT fractious in the gate, stalked the top pair from outside then four deep into the turn,
lost ground under urging, came three wide into the lane and weakened. LAST CALL LONDON brushed outer rival in the beginning, reserved outside a trio of
rivals, remained wide through the turn and spun five wide into the lane and was outrun. OOBUBBAKAKAYO got crowded leaving the gate and dropped
back, traveled five then six wide around the turn and was never involved.

Footnotes
HANNAH BUCKLE (IRE) traveled along the inside off the pace, raced in mid-pack up the backstretch, waited for room behind the leaders on the far turn and
upper stretch, found a seam and bid between the top pair, then surged clear to win going away. HELGA BRANDT (IRE) bumped between rivals early,
stalked from inside through both turns, tipped two wide and confronted the leader entering the lane, took over in upper stretch, collared by the winner at the
sixteenth pole and yielded. SOPHISTICATE rank early outside a rival near the back, asked three then four deep on the far turn, tipped out further at the top
of the stretch and summoned a mild late rally. SWEET DELTA DAWN went up to take the lead from inside, pressured by outer rival in the middle stages,
cleared at the five-sixteenths pole, challenged entering the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened late. LOVIN' ON THE RUN tracked in the two
path, chased between two to three wide on the far turn, angled in upper stretch and could not rally. DANGEROUS AFFAIR closest in pursuit from the two
path, applied pressure in the middle stages, lost touch with the leader on the far turn, chased between to the stretch and faltered. UPCHARGE saved
ground from off the pace to the stretch, lacked room along the fence inside a rival and was not persevered with late. EVERYTHING BUGS ME rated two
then three deep early, remained three wide into the far turn, spun four wide into the lane and weakened. LOVE ALIVE trailed from inside, went outside a
rival leaving the backstretch, rounded the far turn three then four wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
A TOAST TO LANIE broke a step slow, dueled from inside up the backstretch and around the turn, dug in gamely holding a slight edged over WISHES TO
RICHES through the drive and was all out to prevail. WISHES TO RICHES dueled outside A TOAST TO LANIE to the stretch, battled gamely down the the
lane but had to settle for second best. TIZ LISSETT took up leaving the gate, chased out of range from inside, moved out around the bend and came three
wide into the lane, could not close on the top pair in the final furlong but kept on to hold third. BAJAN BASHERT got knocked into outer rival soon after the
start, climbed a bit under coaxing, exited the backstretch in the two path, angled in and saved ground through the turn, offered a mild response to urging and
could not get by TIZ LISSETT for the show honors. ANNIE'S HOPE coaxed along early well off the rail, chased five wide into the turn, angled in and exited
the bend in the two path but failed to threaten in the lane. HOLLYWOOD PENNY reluctant to load behind the gate, got bumped from inside in the beginning,
chased three wide into the turn, angled five wide leaving the bend and lacked a rally. MOONLIGHT TRYST chased out of range out wide, went from the six
path over to the four path on the turn, moved inward in the lane and could not make an impact. LITA WAY broke cleanly then got bumped from inside shortly
after, had once beat eight wide into the turn, moved in a few paths then entered the lane seven wide and was never a factor. SMILING AMY came out and
bumped early, raced in range early, went two wide into the turn, angled out to the four path and faded. QUICK OMEN tracked outside rivals early on, went
four, five then six wide around the bend and weakened in the lane. PROCEEDTOTHEROUTE got knocked into outer rival early, dropped back and trailed
into the turn, saved ground on the inside and was outrun. NOBLE RUNNER sat off the pace while wide through the early going, went seven wide into the
turn, moved to the five path then came six wide into the stretch and proved no menace.
