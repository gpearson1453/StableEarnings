the far turn then rallied between foes for the place. FIRST SHOT FIRED steadied nearing the first turn, raced off the pace two and three wide and rallied for
the show. NO PLEBEIAN saved ground off the early pace, went two wide around the far turn, angled four wide near the quarter pole and had a mild rally.
OCALA ROCKET raced two and three wide in midpack, steadied late on the first turn, was blocked in upper stretch, angled out leaving the eighth pole and
finished evenly. BUILDER JAK prompted the winner two wide and weakened in the lane. MILCHIN chased the pace three and four wide and faded in the
drive. PARAKEET (IRE) steadied entering the first turn, saved ground and failed to menace. DIXIE PREACH hit the starting gate then bumped soon after,
raced off the pace four wide around the first turn, checked to the avoid the fallen rider early on the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and was
never involved. UZZIAH bumped at the start, raced two and three wide and never threatened. FIGHT TIL DAWN bumped at the start, raced four and five
wide and was never in contention. TREASURE FLAY clipped heels late on the first turn, lost the rider and was transported off the track in the equine
ambulance. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT LATE ON THE FIRST TURN AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER
THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
MOMZA set the pace in the two path around the first turn, dueled outside of HONESTO in the three path around the far turn and through the stretch and
prevailed. HONESTO saved ground around the first turn, moved up inside of the winner to take the lead down the backstretch, dueled inside in the two path
around the far turn and through the lane and was narrowly outfinished in a game try. GOOCH GO BRAGH was firmly rated off the pace three wide and was
one-paced through the lane to maintain the show. ENGLISH PAINTER chased the pace three and four wide and lacked the needed rally. EUPHORIA STAR
saved ground and failed to menace. COACH ABERNATHY had early speed four wide then steadily faded. ENSIGN SKIP was outrun while racing two and
three wide.

Footnotes
ADIOS PAPA CHICO chased in the four path, was coaxed along around the turn, took aim in the five path at the top of the lane, kicked on to bid inside the
final furlong, took the lead while being herded out around the sixteenth, and drew clear late. TAPARINO trailed in the five path early, improved position
under a ride around the turn, tipped out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, and rallied for place. COME DREAM WITH ME got bumped by an inner
foe at the start, vied for the lead inside, took command passing the quarter pole, tipped out to the three path at the top of the lane, inched away passing the
eighth pole, but drifted out passing the sixteenth, and yielded late to show. CAJUN'S CHOICE dueled for the lead in the two path, received a right handed
cue midway around the turn, but was one paced. BLAZE OF COLOR broke out at the start, tracked in the two path but faded. WINOOSKI broke out and
bumped an outer foe, rated in the two path but never threatened. GO CHARLIE GO had a slow start, stalked in the three path early but weakened.
GENTLEMAN CALLER raced off the pace in the three path and was no menace.

CART GIRL SAM stalked the pace from the rail, swung three wide nearing the eighth pole, kicked in and was up late. CONDORA pressed the pace two
wide, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, continued on the left lead and was unable to resist the winner late. THE DOVE RULES raced well back two wide
and rallied between foes to gain the show late. VAL'S GAL saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. TATOR MADE
chased the pace two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. FACE THE MUSIC played no factor while racing three wide. WARDA set the pace along
the rail to midstretch and wilted.

Footnotes
WICKLOW GAL set the pace in the two path, came under a nudge going into the far turn, received a right handed cue midway around the far turn, began to
draw away passing the quarter, floated out to the five path in upper stretch, and held sway. QUEEN DEYMAR trailed in the four path, came under a ride
entering the far turn, swung from the five path into the stretch, and ran on for place. DON'T GET PICKLED bumped with an outer foe at the start, then
steadied along the inside into the first turn, raced off the pace inside down the backstretch, was driven from the three path turning into the lane, angled out
for the final sixteenth, and kept on for show. ANDIE ONE laid up close in the two path, was coaxed along the rail around the far turn, but finished evenly
from the two path in the stretch. SMART SPENDING rated in the three path but flattened from the four path down the lane. CURRENT SITUATION bumped
with an inner foe at the start, moved up four wide around the first turn to prompt the pace in the four path down the backstretch, came under right handed
encouragement from the three path early into the far turn, but faded in the stretch. SADE PURSE stalked in the five path, floated out to the eight path turning
into the lane, and weakened.

FOUNDER'S DAY set a pressured pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. GAYLES EVENING pressed the winner two
wide, could not keep pace with that foe in upper stretch but lasted for the place. CHLOE'S TOY tracked the pace two and three wide and had only a mild
stretch gain. TREVESS went evenly inside. ST. PAT'S DAY chased the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
ETRURIAN showed the way in the three path, waited confidently in the two path rounding the turn before receiving a right handed cue nearing the quarter,
kicked away from the two path in upper stretch, and held sway. RIDE ON CUPID steadied early, laid off the pace in the three path, was ridden in the four
path around the turn, and ran on for place. BEDROCK BIRDIE chased in the two path, was driven along the rail around the turn, tipped out to the three path
turning into the lane, but flattened for show. FIELDS OF GREEN stalked in the four path but faded.

ORO ORO settled off the pace while racing two wide, edged closer inside around the far turn, tipped three wide turning for home, closed outside and was up
in deep stretch. DIALITHIC prompted the pace two wide, took the lead between foes nearing the sixteenth pole and led until the final strides. BELLWETHER
saved ground off the pace, went two wide around the far turn and rallied for the show. MUSICAL JOURNEY was hustled to the front, set the pace along the
rail and yielded near the sixteenth pole. MISS HOLLY saved ground well off the early, went five wide around the far turn and had a mild belated rally. JUST
MERCY saved ground and failed to menace. PLANKTON chased the pace three wide and faded after a half. SEEKINGBYTHESTORM raced in range three
wide for a half then faltered inside around the far turn. DARLING DARLEY saved ground off the pace, made slight progress three wide around the far turn
but lacked a closing bid. NIGHTSABER (GB) played no factor while racing three and four wide. ANONYMOUS SOURCE was outrun while racing three and
four wide. D CITY GIRL trailed in the two path.
