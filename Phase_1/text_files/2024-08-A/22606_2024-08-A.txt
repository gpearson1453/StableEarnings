Footnotes
MY BUDDY BROOKS soon shared the lead from outside, was two wide taking the bend, battled outside REDBIRD NATION in the lane, edged ahead inside
the final sixteenth and began to draw off in the waning yards. REDBIRD NATION broke alertly, was soon challenged from outside, fought gamely trough the
stretch, did not have enough left but was easily best of the rest. ALEXSIS without early speed, moved to the inside into the turn, rallied in the stretch, dueled
for third the last furlong and edged ahead in time. TRICKY MOMENT raced in contention from outside, was just off the inside on the bend, fanned out widest
for the stretch run, edged ahead for third, battled gamely to the wire but was outfinished for the show. SPICY VALENTINA in the second flight from inside,
floated out some for the stretch run, fought for third between rivals but did not have enough left. BLAKELY'S BOY bobbled as he swiped the gate breaking a
bit inward and showed little thereafter.

ATTACK advanced three wide on the turn, drifted out some entering the lane, vied for the lead inside the final furlong, edged ahead briefly nearing the
sixteenth marker, did not have enough to hold back TU ROYAL but was clearly second best. STARSOVERPARADISE contested the pace between rivals,
was two wide taking the turn then wore down inside the last eighth. SILVER EYES an early factor from inside, gradually progressed along the rail, angled
out three wide for a clear path upper stretch then leveled off inside the final eighth. DRAGONFLY KISSES faded from inside after two furlongs, angled out
widest for the stretch run and passed a couple tired rivals. BRIANA HARPER was hustled to dispute the pace from outside but began to fade before

Footnotes
RED ROIL without early speed from outside, picked up his pace after a quarter mile, angled in on the bend, swung out four wide for a clear path entering the
lane and swept past CARNACK ON TOUR with sixty yards to go. CARNACK ON TOUR raced in the second flight from outside, took the lead two wide on
the turn, floated out some into the stretch then began to wear down in the late going. CUTADAY hesitated at the start, gradually progressed from inside to
have a striking position midstretch but leveled off instead. HALF THE BATTLE soon trailed, angled out through the turn and passed outside tired ones the
last eighth. LELAND JOHN in the second flight early, was just off the rail on the bend, lost some ground fanning outside RED ROIL into the lane and faded.
PLAY THE BLUES moved clear of the rest after the first eighth, was overtaken from outside on the turn then gave way just off the inside through the stretch.

AROSE FOR LYLA rated just off the rail, saved ground on the bend, fanned outside ICY RIVER for the drive, responded a couple taps from the riding crop
and swept past the latter with a sixteenth mile to go. WILDCAT BOBBIE raced closest to the early speed, angled out some on the turn, came widest into the
lane, could not hold back AROSE FOR LYLA but caught ICY RIVER nearing the wire for second. ICY RIVER broke alertly, was encouraged to sprint far
away from the rest then wore down just off the rail through the stretch. RONAN rated from outside on the backstretch, picked up her pace just off the rail
through the bend, came three wide into the stretch and rallied belatedly between rivals. GO MADI GO settled inside, saved ground taking the turn, rallied
along the rail through the lane, found herself boxed in deep stretch, altered out some and was steadied in a narrowing path nearing the wire.

Footnotes
MADI'S CIRCLE was kept close, had the rail on the turn, swung outside HUCKLEBERRY HUSTLE for the stretch run, took the lead and moved clear inside
the last furlong, dug in through the waning yards and kept I DID THE MATH at bay. I DID THE MATH hesitated slightly then broke outward, bumping
HUCKLEBERRY HUSTLE'S rear, was settled outside, commenced her bid while widest through the bend, was all out in the stretch, came up short but
proved easily second best. HUCKLEBERRY HUSTLE pressed the early speed from outside, went for the lead two wide on the turn, moved to the fore into
the lane and wore down from path three the final eighth. HARPER BRIANA chased from just off the inside, had the rail on the bend, floated out into the
stretch, gradually angled back to the rail and lacked a significant response. WIN WITH COLOR void of speed, lost position while just off the inside taking the
turn, fanned out some for the stretch run and had no late bid. IT'S ON hesitated at the start and was never a factor in a ground-saving trip. AIR GERRI soon
had the lead, was challenged from outside leaving the turn then gave way between horses through the lane.

Footnotes
EURO SUPRISE prominent just behind the early speed, found himself boxed in on the bend, was steadied behind traffic nearing the end of a half mile, got
through four wide between rivals leaving the turn, soon battled for the lead outside ROAD GAME and edged ahead nearing the wire. ROAD GAME vied for
the lead from the beginning, was caught in tight quarters between GRAPHENE CASSOCK and MAJOR CONTENDER midway on the backstretch, gained a
wider path two wide on the turn, fought gamely in the lane but did not have enough left in the waning yards. MODAZZLE a step slow at the start, lugged in a
few strides from the gate, bumped NOT AGAIN JACKIE, was settled off the rail, advanced three wide on the bend, lost ground fanning six wide for the
stretch run, loomed a threat with a furlong to go but could only gain third inside the last sixteenth. GRAPHENE CASSOCK disputed the pace inside rivals,
was just off the rail into the lane and gradually wore down the last furlong. SUPER SILVER also a step slow at the break, jostled with FEROCITY leaving the
chute, was settled well off the inside, in path three on the turn, lost ground angling out seven wide at the top of the stretch and showed a willingness to run
late. MAJOR CONTENDER advanced between horses to vie for the lead on the backstretch but began to yield three wide after three furlongs. READY
MADE pressed the pace from outside, was four wide on the bend, floated out some into the stretch and faded. NOT AGAIN JACKIE bumped from the rear
shortly after the start, was an early contender from inside but had no late bid. FEROCITY a step slow, as well, at the start, jostled briefly with SUPER
SILVER leaving the chute and showed little in a wide trip.

FEVER NATION hesitated then altered in for a clear path at the break, advanced between horses to vie for the lead three wide on the bend, led into the
stretch, drew off under urging and maintained control while kept to task. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY settled well off the inside, commenced his bid on the turn,
split horses three wide just inside the furlong marker, took over second nearing the final sixteenth and was closing the gap on FEVER NATION late.
WILDWOOD RUBEN broke inward, raced in contention from inside, angled out four wide on the bend, moved clear for second upper stretch then leveled off
the last eighth. SWAGGY GEORGE hustled along early between rivals, swung out widest through the turn and only passed outside a couple tired horses
deep stretch. CHEEKERS vied for the lead just outside SPANISH DOUBLOON then gave way two wide after a half mile. SPANISH DOUBLOON disputed
the pace from inside for four furlongs then also gave way.

Footnotes
I'M YOUR VALENTINE shared the lead outside rivals from the start, was three wide taking the turn, dueled through the lane and edged ahead of ON THE
MONEY RED nearing the wire. ON THE MONEY RED somewhat unruly in the gate, contested the pace between horses, was two wide through the bend,
fought inside I'M YOUR VALENTINE in the lane and slowly yielded in the waning yards. DEVIL'S RULE broke on top, soon had the rail and found himself
just off the pace, went for the lead from inside on the turn then gradually wore down inside the final furlong. MAMAS FIRE was a step slow at the break,
taken to the outside early on, gained a striking position five wide on the bend, floated out further into the stretch and could only make up minor ground inside
the last eighth. FAST CROSS TRAFFIC raced in contention from outside, was four wide taking the turn then flattened out for the drie. STROPE was a factor
just off the inside on the backstretch but began to yield at the end of a half mile.
