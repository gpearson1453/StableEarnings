GENERAL GINNY good position to turn, took up chase in the stretch and coasted clear in a solid effort. CINQUE AMORE quick to the front, set pace to the
stretch, overtaken and no match for the winner while holding the place spot at the wire. FUTURE FLAY outside run to turn, kept grinding in the stretch run
for third while just missing the runner up spot. UP IN ARMS tardy start, between horses to turn, in a drive stretch, no gain. FOR THE BISCUIT chased and
tried to keep up with a steady from the turn. FIANNA HILLS never menaced throughout.

Footnotes
ANN KOR perfect position to turn inside, angled out for clear run, ran on gamely to run away from the field under good handling to the wire. SHORT ON
THE SUGAR pinched back a bit start, no speed to turn, ran on late no match. LANDY quick speed outside to the turn, stayed on stretch missed place.
FABULOUS PHILLY outside run to the turn kept on evenly with no gain in stretch. HAPPYSECRET dueled to the turn from inside and gave way readily
stretch run. ABIGAIL G had no chance from the start and never recovered. WICKED HEART through early dropped back readily. WAY BALI always trailed
throughout.
