Footnotes
INDYVILLE set the pace under mild pressure ro midway on the turn, repelled a challenge at the quarter pole to quickly clear in upper stretch and finished
uncontested through the lane a convincing winner. ROBERT'S MOON broke inward, stalked th pace from the fence on the turn, cut the corner coming home
to save all the ground and ground out the place position. JOURNEY pressed the pace to midway on the turn, ranged up two wide to engage the leader at
the quarter pole, was repelled by that one and kept-on through the lane as best of the rest. LOU MAN reserved off the pace, made a mild rally turning for
home with no impact. SNEAKY FEET slow in the early going, was hustled up to contention down the backside and finished evenly. NORMANDY NEMAN
broke a step slow and shied when the outside rival drifted into the vacancy and continued on as no threat. BEST DRESSED MAN tracked the leaders for
three-eighths and gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
ROAR OF SILENCE rated in a clear pocket well off the top pair down the backstretch, commenced a rally on the far turn, took command in upper stretch
and drew off as much best while being kept to task in the lane. ANNA AFTER MIDNITE rank early tossing head under restraint while keeping pace with the
pacesetter, settled on the backside to stalk, rallied on the turn to threaten, was no match for the winner but kept on willingly to hold the place. CATHOLIC
SUE was tardily away from the gate, steadily advanced on the field leaving the half mile pole and closed mildly to be up for the show. TRIBEST (ARG) sped
off to the lead dueling into the first turn, opened a wide advantage through quick fractions to the far turn, maintained the lead while weakening on the final
bend and stopped in mid-stretch having been used up. MS KS DYNASTY went one-paced and was not a threat. MULSANNE (IRE) broke a step slow and
trailed as no factor. INTERNAL FRACTIONS WERE HAND TIMED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.

MORNING LINE NEWS stalked the pacesetter to the far turn, rallied to steadily gain on the leader to mid-stretch and overhauled that one in the final eighth
to be pulling away late in the drive. SUMMER AT THE SPA set the pace on a clear, well rated lead, widened the advantage down the backside, responded
when called upon turning for home and was unable to hold off the closing winner while being clearly second best. MAIDEN ROCK tracked the leaders
throughout, failed to close ground on the top pair and kept-on as best of the rest. KITTEN ROCKS squeezed and bounced between rivals leaving the gate
and went evenly failing to menace at any time. SIGNATURE STREET broke outward bumping rival away from the gate and raced near the rear of the field
as a non-threat the entire way. NIFF was outrun.

TU CHA crowded at the start, moved up to stalk the pace from the fence through the turn, cut the corner to engage the pacesetter in mid-stretch and
prevailed in the drive. DEVIL sped off to a clear lead for the first half, dug-in dueling down the lane and was outkicked in the final strides in a game effort.
RUMBRANDT tracked the leaders to the turn, rallied six wide turning for home to loom in upper stretch and flattned out in the drive. PRINCESS TENKO
broke a step tardy, was urged to keep pace early and showed some late interest passing rivals in the stretch. SUPRISE ME AGAIN bumped at the start and
went evenly as a non-threat. TEXAS HOTTIE broke outward crowding all to his outside in a chain reaction, raced up to press the pace, had no response
when called upon in the turn and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
RAMBERT sped to the lead, opened a clear advantage through the turn, dug-in gamely when challenged in upper stretch and just held at the wire.
MADELYN BELLE stalked the pacesetter to midway on the turn, idled when called upon nearing the quarter pole, kept-on in the lane and found his best
stride late to just miss at the wire. CHROME ATTACK unhurried in the early going, advanced up the rail on the turn, cut the corner turning for home saving
all the ground and rallied well up the rail to come up just short at the line in a good effort. FROSTED ECLAIR raced mid-pack and showed some mild late
interest without impact. COTTON CANDY ANNIE trailed most of the way and never posed a threat. RACEDAY ATTIRE leaned in leaving the gate,
straightened away to track the leaders from three wide on the turn and flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
SENDEMDOWNTHEROAD sped to the lead, opened a clear advantage and was never seriously threatened in a convincing performance. MALIBU BRAD
stalked the pace through the turn, rallied in upper stretch but was unable to gain on the winner while finishing willingly to be second best. CAPTAIN'S FLAG
came in at the start when inside rival broke a step slow, raced up to be well placed tracking the leader, rallied on the turn to loom in upper stretch and
flattened out unable to sustain the rally. GRAY MIKE threw head in the first few strides to be at the rear of the field and passed tiring rivals in the stretch.
KEYSER went one-paced never posing a threat. ILLEGAL ICE broke a step tardy, clipped heels when outside rival came in to fill the hole away from the
gate and continued on as no factor having lost all chance early. THE RIDER OF ILLEGAL ICE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST CAPTAIN'S FLAG FOR
INTERFERENCE AT THE START, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

FRANKEL BABY set the pace under mild pressure through quick fractions, cleared in upper stretch and held the closers safe through the lane. STAR
WISHER reserved in mid-pack along the rail in the turn, tipped out three wide turning for home, bobbled in upper stretch, re-gained his balance and closed
well to be gaining at the wire. SECRET OPERATION unhurried early, angled nine wide to rally on the outside beletedly in the lane.
GRACELEADSUSHOME reserved off the pace in the turn, saved ground cutting the corner to mount a rail rally that came up short. CLOEY ATTACK
tracked the leaders to be well placed turning for home, loomed in upper stretch and flattened out late in the drive. RIETTA went evenly failing to menace.
DOCS SEVEN passed tiring rivals. DIAMONDS JOY prompted the pace for a half and gave way in the lane. BACKSTAGE PASS stalked the pace and was
through after a half mile.

CONI'S COUP was well rated on a clear, comfortable lead, responded when called upon turning for home and pulled away unchallenged. CATEGORY TEN
stalked the pacesetter down the backside, split rivals while commencing a rally in to the far turn, failed to gain on the winner but kept-on willingly to be
second best. VALIANT WEST tracked the leaders from three wide to the far turn, mounred a bid on the final bend and failed to sustain the rally finishing
evenly. HOPPIN JOHN trailed for a half mile and rallied steadily through the lane to be gaining late. DANVILLE failed to menace. CHAMPAGNE MIKE
prompted the pace, was through after a half and was eased to the wire and walked off. THE PLACE PICK EIGHT WINNING NUMBERS WERE:

EXTRA HALO split rivals in the first sixteenth to take the lead, opened a clear advantage on the turn and widened the lead to the wire having been
unthreatened. EASY FAST reserved off the pace early, rallied from five wide on the turn, angled in at the head of the lane and closed well to gain the place.
WE MISS ARLINGTON stalked the pace from three wide through the turn, failed to gain on the leader and kept-on willingly in the lane to be clearly the best
of the rest. ICE AXE unhurried early, was set to a drive in the turn and kept grinding through the lane. GOD GUNS N GUTS lunged at the start to spot the
field several lengths, trailed most of the way and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. SECRET HONOR chased the pace and faded on the turn. TALLAPOOSA
pressed the pace from the rail early and gave way.

NATHANIEL'S HOPE tracked the leaders for a half mile from the rail, made a steady advance on the turn, angled five wide at the head of the stretch and
closed willingly to be going away late in the drive. SHARP STICK stalked the pace through the final turn and rallied in the lane to gain the place. T LAW
reserved off the pace into the far turn, rallied along the fence coming home and was gaining belatedly. SECESSION set the pace on a clear lead, widened
the advantage down the backside and tired midway in the lane. REGIMENTAL shuffled at the start to be well out the back of the pack, remained unhurried
for a half and gained steadily with good late interest. PRINCE IS MY BOY went evenly failing to menace. J J'S SOLUTION broke outward brushing rival,
raced up to prompt the pace for a half and faded coming home. DASH TO THE CASH bumped leaving the gate to be pushed out to outside rivals path,
continued at the rear of the field and was never a factor. ANCIENT MAN dropped back after a half mile and was outrun.
