NAPOLETANO was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and was up in the final sixteenth to win going away. CORN POP vied for the lead with
WINTER FALCON from along the inside, opened a clear lead nearing the eighth pole but was unable to resist the winner late in a game effort. OVERLY
FAST saved ground stalking the pace, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished well for third in a steady effort. WINTER FALCON vied with
CORN POP for the lead into the stretch from along the outside and weakened slightly late. ITSALLABOUTTHERIDE was allowed to settle early, came

CANDY CABALLO was bumped at the start from both sides by COLONEL LUDLOW and CHECKERED FLAG then pinched back, saved ground while being
reserved, slipped through during the drive and finished with a rush to be up in the final strides. HE'S NOT TALKING was forwardly placed early, came
three-wide into the stretch, took the lead from DA SMOKE nearing the eighth pole and then just failed to last. DA SMOKE saved ground setting the pace into
the stretch, drifted out slightly nearing the eighth pole when headed and held on gamely to the wire. CHECKERED FLAG broke in toe bump CANDY
CABALLO then was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and finished well in a steady effort. GOIN' SOUTH was off a step slow then ducked out sharply
after the break, raced five-wide early, came eighth-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. FORTYSHADESOFTIGER settled in the middle
of the field early and lacked a rally. TIZ GRAZEN was allowed to settle, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. WEST COAST BULL
prompted the pace from along the outside to the stretch and weakened. LOCALLYWORLDFAMOUS was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch
and was not a factor. MIDNIGHT APPROVAL was allowed to settle, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. COLONEL LUDLOW broke out to
bump with the winner the showed early speed from between horses and gave way.

Footnotes
NATION OF FAITH was unhurried early, moved forward nearing the quarter pole while racing two-wide then came tree-wide into the stretch and was up in
the final sixteenth. SUMMANUS saved ground setting the pace, drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths pole to be two-wide entering the stretch and held on
gamely when headed. BLUES RAPPER saved ground while dropping back, slipped through during the drive and rallied late. QUAGMIRE MAGIC tracked
SUMMANUS while racing two-wide, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. HICKORY WIND was reserved off the pace while racing three-wide
and failed to be a factor. HELEN'S SUN saved ground while being allowed to settle and tired.
