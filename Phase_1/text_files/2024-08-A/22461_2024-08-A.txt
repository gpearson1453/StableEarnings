Footnotes
MARKED KISS broke in and brushed at the start, stalked the pace, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, closed steadily and wore down
INEEDAMARKER to get up late. INEEDAMARKER pressed the pace, assumed command entering the stretch, inched clear, led to deep stretch and was
outclosed to finish second best. BERN DANGER veered in at the start, was never far off the pace, was in traffic on the turn and in the upper stretch, altered
course and closed well late. HURRICANES WILDCAT was slow early and improved position in a steady effort. BONNIE MAE'S MARK brushed at the start,
set the pace to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. LA BELLA BELLA put in an even effort in an outside trip and failed to menace. ON MY
MARK broke in, showed good early speed while racing inside, fell back on the turn and gave way. NOT A REHEARSAL broke slowly and was steadied at
the start, was taken wide, rushed up to the turn and stopped in the upper stretch. STORMY RYTHM raced evenly in an outside trip and did not threaten.
BOSSES NIGHTMARE hesitated at the start to be off slowly, was impeded, checked hard, fell far back and trailed.

Footnotes
AMERICAN CHERUB stalked the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, assumed command, drew clear and held safely. THE SMOOCH stalked the
pace, swung wide leaving the turn, closed steadily and finished second best. SIS SPENDER broke in the air to be off slowly, advanced outside, dropped in,
bid willingly to get within range and came up empty late. PRO BUSINESS was in tight at the start, raced outside early and improved position in a steady
effort. W F AMERICAN HONEY was in tight at the start, stalked the pace to the turn, swung wide and gave way. LUCKY SHOT ANNIE veered in at the
start, was hustled along to set the pace to the turn, weakened and faded from contention. POP'S PARTY showed brief speed along the inside, dropped
back and was outrun. K W AMERIKOVA was checked hard after the start, was not urged and trailed the field.

Footnotes
HOLY REBEL came in a bit at the start, set the pace, was under pressure through the stretch and held on in a game effort. WANING CRECENT pressed
the pace, vied through the stretch, couldn't gain on the winner and was outfinished in a good effort. GIMME A WHO raced close to the pace, challenged for
the lead on the turn, vied to mid stretch, came up empty late and settled for show. RUNAWAY VICTORY rallied between horses entering the turn, bid along
the rail entering the stretch to get within range and hung. AMERICAN KNIGHT lagged early, went six wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed late
response. AIR SPORT ONE was slow early, taken outside, went seven wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. TRACK RUNNER was fractious loading, a bit
crowded at the start, dropped inside, was checked along the rail entering the turn and dropped back.

leaving the turn and lacked a bid. BUDDY'S PAL was in tight early and failed to menace in an even effort. EL PATO bumped at the start, was in tight early

Footnotes
IZE ON SAVANNAH lagged early, swung wide entering the stretch, closed steadily and wore down her rivals to get up in the final strides. HOODWINKED
KATE broke out, was never far back while racing wide, closed willingly, led late and was caught near the wire. RAEGAN'S STORM pressed the pace, fell
back on the turn, continued willingly to the wire and was outfinished in a game effort. CHANCE TO DREAM raced close to the pace, swung wide leaving the
turn, bid to get within range and didn't have enough late. FAUZETA'S FLAME set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and faltered near the
sixteenth pole. MI PRINCESA raced mid pack, advanced on the turn and lacked a stretch response. CANDY TRACK pressed the pace to the turn and gave
way.. JULIA'S PROMISE was not a factor. MOTORING IN FRONT was outrun.
