Footnotes
MAGIC TOKEN took control past the wire the first time, rated onto the backstretch, began to quicken into the far turn, drew well clear through the stretch
under steady handling. AUDIBLY last away, continued unhurried early, continued firmly in hand in the run up the backstretch, angled out four wide when
beginning to advance turning for home, finished willingly to be clearly second best, not a serious threat to the winner. STREETCORNER away in good
order, prompted the winner through the first turn, chased that one up the backstretch, moved closer in the far turn then lacked a further advance on the
winner, proved no match for the runner up the final furlong as well, saved the show. INCISIVE KITTEN raced forwardly while tracking the winner from along
the inside, came up empty when called on for the stretch drive. THE SPLENDID ONE void of early foot, continued back through the final turn, improved
position late without posing a serious threat. STEAM KNOT settled in the main group toward the front, raced between horses through the final turn, lacked a
closing kick. INTEL AGENT lacked speed along the inside, continued to save ground through the final turn and into the stretch, encountered some traffic
inside the furlong marker, altered course but failed to make an impact in the late going. PRACTICAL ROYALTY remained always back in lacking a rally.
BISCUIT four wide through the first turn, continued outside, three wide in mid pack through the second bend, tired through the stretch. FRACTIONAL TIMES
AND FINAL ADDED FOLLOWING VIDEO REVIEW.

Footnotes
BOUNCER broke well, relinquished the advantage into the turn, moved out, vied between horses early in the bend, dueled into the stretch while in hand,
shook clear into the stretch, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire while being kept to task. WHISKEY AND YOU in the second group while
outside early, came three wide for the drive, rallied to be a hard earned second, no threat to the winner. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK in mid pack while off the
inside, dueled for second final furlong, outkicked for that position. FREEZE THE FIRE void of speed for four furlongs, was five wide out of the turn, showed
some belated interest down the middle of the strip in improve position. TRIPLE ELVIS in tight in some traffic along the inside after a furlong, steadied,
moved out three wide, vied then dueled outside the winner late in the turn, weakened through the stretch. GRUNT lacked speed, moved out and raced four
wide out of the turn, lacked a serious bid. DANCIN WITH ANGELS took over outside the winner soon after the start, moved to the rail, took up when in tight
with a half to run, fell back and did not fully recover. CLASSIER in the main body while outside, four wide midway on the turn, backed up steadily through
the stretch.

Footnotes
CHARLOTTESAPPROVAL broke with the field, settled inside, patiently handled through the turn while covered up along the rail, altered course approaching
midstretch, roused when clear, exploded the final sixteenth to win going away. MORNING MIRACLE forwardly placed early, fell back off the pace a bit to
race in the second flight in the two path through the bend, between horses past the furlong marker, mild amount of late interest to be up late for the place,
no threat to the winner. NOTICE ME TOO took command soon after the start, showed the way through the turn under light restraint through the turn,
extended that advantage nearing the furlong marker, offered zero resistance to the winner the final furlong, weakened and was nailed at the wire for the
place. SPLASH OF JACK one paced while racing off the inside, three wide into the stretch, continued in even fashion to the wire in lacking a closing punch.
ENRICHED pressed the pace while racing off the inside for three furlongs, had little left for the drive. GIN GIN'S APPROVAL in the second group while
racing along the inside, also was found lacking when called on upper stretch. NO MORE KISSES last away, remained always back. DIVA DE ORO lost left
iron for sever strides after the start, fell back to trail and was not heard from.

Footnotes
BODECREAM away well, raced forwardly, moved closest to the leader in the second turn, continued to chase that one into the stretch, late bid outside,
wore that same rival down under brisk handling. SOUPER ATTENTIVE broke on top, set the pace along the inside, continued to hold the advantage into the
stretch, responded when confronted by the winner in the final sixteenth, gave ground grudgingly to that rival. SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD settled off the pace
inside, continued to save ground, inched closer to the top pair when straightened for home then continued to slowly gain on that pair to the wire. SMALL
FIELD void of speed for six furlongs, cut the corner to improve position into the straight, continued to better position to the wire. STREET COPPER lacked
early speed as well, improved position in the two path through the some traffic into the stretch, flattened out a bit in the late going. SMART STRIKER went
one paced throughout while racing off the inside. MAGIC HEART closest to the runner up for five furlongs, had little left for the stretch run. MASSIF last to
leave, lodged a middle move to reach contention in the second turn, gave way through the stretch. KOLOMIO void of speed off the inside, swung out five
wide turning for home, made little impact in the run to the wire. GUARANTEED SPECK also lacked any early foot, failed to muster a rally. BOLD MAJESTIC
was finished after a half.

Footnotes
REGALO close from the start while between rivals backstretch, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, continued to alternate for the advantage
through a spirted stretch battle, proved game to gain the nod. AWESOME RUTA vied up front three wide early, dueled through the turn outside the winner,
remained on equal terms with that one the length of the stretch, missed the nod,. HADES settled off the pace, continued within striking distance the middle
half, roused three wide for the drive, some late gain, not enough for the top pair. REAL MACHO back off the early pace and the inside, between rivals late in
the turn, angled out a bit and was roused four wide for the drive, displayed a mild amount of late interest while remaining out in the strip. CATALEYA
STRIKE in mid pack while racing outside, four wide through the turn, floated five wide into the stretch, lacked a closing kick. RAINY SKIES flashed some
early foot along the inside, fell back off the top two into the turn, came in the two path when set down for the drive, faded. ANNOINTED last to leave, trailed
while saving ground, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
CARMELINA broke on top, set a pressured pace up the backstretch toward the inside, shrugged off that nearest pursuer to be clear entering the stretch,
enough left to hold sway over the runner up late while under firm handling. CAP CLASSIQUE within striking distance while along the inside, remained within
striking distance of the winner turning for home, shifted out a bit, closed the gap on that rival inside the furlong marker but was too late at the wire.
DAZZLING MOVE moved off the inside backstretch, raced three wide with the main group through the turn, roused for the drive, proved no match for the top
pair late. SAVANNAMARIE last to leave, continued to trail up the backstretch and into the turn, moved closer with a five wide move exiting the bend, failed
to sustain that advance through the stretch. POPOVER GAL raced in the rear flight, saved ground into the lane, improved slightly by cutting the corner but
managed only an even performance through the lane. GIRVIN'S PRINCESS settled off the pace and the inside, failed to muster a response in the drive.
KISSEDBYANANGEL broke out, was straightened to press the winner four almost four furlongs from the outside, gave way four wide entering the stretch.

BEAUTY OF THE SEA with the while between horses up the backstretch and through the turn, edged clear of the other speed nearing the furlong grounds,
continued to inch away the final furlong under firm handling. HOLLYWOOD WALK last to leave after being bumped, raced back off the pace toward the
inside, called on for run in upper stretch in the two path, inherited the second position when MEDALLA MATCH was pulled up in deep stretch, slowly closing
the gap on the winner late, edged clear for the place. BLAME DAY broke in, bumped the runner up, fell back to trail, lacked speed while saving ground, cut
the corner into the lane, staged a mild rally up the rail to be clear for the show. BOSSERATI moved up inside to show the way in the two path, continued to
hold a narrow advantage through the turn, gradually weakened through the stretch. CHAMBEAU prompted the pace while outside, forward and four wide
through the turn, retreated through the stretch. MEDALLA MATCH behind the pace for three furlongs, swung out five wide turning for home, was advancing
while widest inside the furlong grounds, went wrong a sixteenth out, pulled up and was transported off the track via the equine ambulance.

Footnotes
DREAM SHAKE outrun in the early going off the inside, continued in mid pack through the turn, came four wide for the drive, roused, displayed good late
energy to prove best. WITTY broke back, continued to lack speed through the turn off the inside, angled five wide into the stretch, rallied well out in the
course to prove second best. DETERMINED KINGDOM in the second flight while between horses, in tight through midway on the bend, continued behind
traffic nearing the furlong marker, altered course to the outside for room with a sixteenth to run and was also going well at the end to gain the show.
EAMONN fell back to trail after the start, continued to see them all through the turn, came in the two path for the drive, rallied inside and through traffic,
narrowly missed the show. MISTER MMMMM pressed the issue up the backstretch on the outside, vied three wide out of the turn, continued to contest the
first flight past the furlong marker, weakened late. BEAR RIVER dueled early off the inside, contested the pace between foes exiting the turn, held a narrow
advantage with a furlong to run but could not last. MISCHIEF MAGIC (IRE) off a step slow, raced back, fanned six wide by the runner up turning home,
failed to keep up with that one in going evenly through the stretch. CRUZIN MAN broke sharp, quickly angled in to show the way early, was joined by a rival
and dueled into the turn while remaining closest to the inside, remained a pace factor until midstretch before caving in. LITTLE ROO ROO in the second
flight along the inside, continued to be a forward factor into the stretch, gave way in the run to the wire. EXTENDO was finished early. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TRIKARI settled comfortably off the leaders while off the inside, advanced into contention through the final turn, came three wide for the drive, called on for
run, hit his best stride approaching the furlong grounds and finished with good energy to prove clearly best in a sharp effort. BRILLIANT BERTI outrun in the
early going toward the inside, began to move closer while behind the winner in the final bend, angled out four wide for the drive to lose some ground to that
same rival, rallied willingly to be clearly second best while no match in the end. IN A JAM stalked the two leaders early, crept closer to that pair into the far
turn, covered in some traffic late in the bend, continued in traffic nearing the furlong grounds, along for the show when clear while no match for the top two.
GENERAL LEDGER dueled past the wire the first time closest to the inside, set a modest set of early fractions, picked up the pace into the final turn, offered
no resistance to the top two the final three sixteenths, weakened and was caught for the show. MATTINGLY broke running, dueled early then relinquished
the lead to the pace setter, pressed that one through those soft early splits, continued to apply pressure the third quarter when things quickened, vied into
the lane and also faltered in the run to the wire. ROCK'N A HALO last to leave, continued to trail toward the inside, failed to muster a rally.

Footnotes
MOIRA tracked the pace three wide under a loose rein, came three wide off the bend and was put to a long drive, drifted in leaving the furlong marker and
wore down the front runner to get up in the final strides to prove best. FEV ROVER (IRE) set the pace on the inside while being well handled, shook clear
leaving the turn but was caught in the final strides to just miss. NEECIE MARIE was settled early while two wide, coaxed along on the turn and was three
wide by the quarter pole, came five wide off the bend and finished well to gain the show award late. NADETTE (FR) was well rated along the inside, coaxed
along on the far turn to be in contention, swung out three wide leaving the turn, then angled in for racing room by the furlong marker but was not quick
enough to get in the hole and the winner closed that space and then angled back out but needed more late while losing the show award late. LIBBAN
stalked the pace and made a two wide bid by the quarter pole but weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
NATIONS PRIDE (IRE) raced off the pace and the inside under a snug hold for six furlongs, let out a notch in the far turn, moved with a rival to challenge
the faltering leader three wide into the stretch, asked for more run when straightened for home, put a head in front with just less than a furlong remaining
and drew clear under continued firm handling. INTEGRATION outrun early while along the inside, continued to save ground through the first turn and up the
backstretch, steered out three wide when beginning to advance late in the final turn, followed the winner in the three path into the straight, lost contact with
that one with less than a furlong to run but ran on late to annex the place on the outside. ANCIENT ROME off a step slow, lacked speed while under firm
restraint inside, continued to save ground while reserved far turn, moved out a bit for the drive, knifed between foes under energetic handling to reach
closest to the winner with a sixteenth to run, could do little more with that one, failed to contain the runner up. TALK OF THE NATION closest to the leader
while just off the inside, moved on that one inside the winner late in the final turn, challenged between horses upper stretch, had a head in front a furlong
out, could not match the winner, weakened to lose a couple of positions late. SUGOI cleared soon after the start, set a moderate set of fractions toward the
inside, extended advantage after a half, relented when challenged into the stretch and faltered as soon as he was headed, continued to weaken to the wire.
HIGHLAND CHIEF (IRE) well off the pace while in hand early, two path up the backstretch, was asked along in the far turn, managed little in the way of a
response and trailed home.

Footnotes
BY THE SEY SHORE settled off the pace, worked way to rail turn, continued to save ground into the stretch, tipped out three wide when beginning to
advance, late bid, proved best under firm handling. HORSEPOWER broke well, pressed outside the early leader, continued to apply pressure through the
turn, put a head in front and led late, failed to contain the winner, held the place. KING COVEE off a step slow, devoid of any speed in trailing much of the
way, swung out six wide for the drive, bumped with POINT LIAM nearing midstretch, finished up willingly to be in time for the show. OLYMPIC RUNNER
back off the early pace, in the two path behind horses into the straight, continued in traffic past the furlong marker, split foes and rallied through some traffic
to improve. POINT LIAM lacked speed, moved outside, five wide exiting the turn, bumped with KING COVEE with a furlong to run, bettered position a bit.
LONG LANCE raced in mid pack off the inside, lacked a significant closing response. COACHES MEETING chased the two leaders for three furlongs,
weakened final furlong. DOCTOR JEFF broke on top, set a pressured pace along the inside, continued to hold a narrow advantage with a furlong remaining,
fell apart late to lose several positions. BELTANE saved ground to no avail. MARATHONER in the second flight for three furlongs, gave way through the
stretch. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
