evenly chasing through the far turn then down the stretch saving place. UNFAITHFUL WAYS slow early gave a mild rally to upper stretch finishing evenly in
the four path. BIG SIS NIC stalked the pace being dispatched on the far turn weakening in upper stretch. RUNAWAY MOM played no factor. I MATTER was
