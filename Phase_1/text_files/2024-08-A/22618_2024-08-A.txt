Footnotes
CASTAGNA sent to assume early command, set the pace into the first turn, dictated terms through the backstretch run while carving out modest fractions
heading to the half-mile marker, maintained a clear lead into the far turn, extended the lead into the stretch, was kept to task under moderate urging into the
final sixteenth and drew away under hand urging in deep stretch. HARNEY LANE was forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the early pace outside
of CASTAGNA, attended to the modest pace through the backstretch run, chased CASTAGNA three wide and between runners into the far turn, ran in
pursuit into the stretch, could not match strides with the winner into the late stages and stayed on to be second best. SILVER FLIRT settled off of the early
pace while never far back, saved ground into the first turn and was well placed into the backstretch run, made an inside move into the far turn and chased
CASTAGNA to the quarter pole, was not able to keep pace with the top pair past mid-stretch and was well clear at the finish for third. CARLSBADGAL a bit
keen leaving the start, was forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the modest pace while saving ground into the backstretch run, shifted out a path at
the half-mile marker, chased two to three wide into the second turn, lost ground at the furlong pole and could not muster a late response. STARLIT
HARBOR broke a step slowly then made contact with PALACE MISCHIEF at the start and was away slowly, recovered to track the early pace three wide
into the first turn, raced widest into the backstretch run and tracked the modest pace approaching the half-mile marker, chased four wide into the secnod
turn, lost position at the quarter marker, lacked a response into the stretch and tired in the final stages. PALACE MISCHIEF hopped then was shuffled at the
start and was away slowly, was unhurried in the early going, saved ground into the first turn, improved position into the backstretch run and tracked the
modest pace outside of runners heading to the half-mile, chased three wide into the far turn, was outrun into the stretch and did not offer a late response.
This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
A DIME FOR ME rated nicely off of the early pace, tracked outside of the leading pair heading to the half-mile marker, chased four wide into the turn, circled
five wide into the stretch and closed at the furlong marker, responded to urging past mid-stretch and confronted DADDYS NINA into the final sixteenth,
surged in deep stretch and held in a drive at the finish for a determined win. DADDYS NINA broke alertly and showed good speed away from the start, set
moderate early fractions and showed the way into the turn while off of the rail, led into the stretch, was kept to task past the furlong marker and dug in
entering the final sixteenth, was overtaken in deep stretch and was clear for second at the wire. SHOUT IT OUT tracked the moderate early pace from the
inside, saved ground into the turn and was well placed at the quarter marker, made an inside bid at the furlong marker, could not match strides with the
leading pair into the final sixteenth and bested LILA AT THE BEACH for show honors. LILA AT THE BEACH away from the gate in good order, stalked the
moderate early pace from between rivals, was well placed approaching the turn and chased three wide heading to the quarter pole, ran in pursuit of
DADDYS NINA into the stretch, was outkicked into the final sixteenth, weakened in deep stretch and was outfinished for third. SMOOVE AS SILK tracked
the moderate early pace from the second flight, chased outside of rivals into the turn and went three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, lost ground into
the stretch and did not factor in the late stages. WELL SPOKEN LADY threw her head leaving the start and was off slowly, trailed in the early stages, saved
ground into the turn, maintained an inside path into the stretch and did not have an impact. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using
video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
MOUNT PELLIAR allowed to settle away from the start, saved ground into the first turn and was unhurried through the backstretch run while not far back,
maintained an inside path into the far turn and chased the leading pair heading to the quarter marker, ran evenly while within aim into upper stretch,
responded to urging and rallied into the final sixteenth, took command into deep stretch and edged away in the late stages. OH GREAT (IRE) prominent
away from the start, stalked the early pace outside of EFFECTIVE GIG, advanced into the backstretch run and prompted that runner through modest
fractions heading to the half-mile marker, pressed the pace three wide into the far turn, was repelled by EFFECTIVE GIG into upper stretch, re-rallied past
the furlong marker, was outfinished in deep stretch by the oncoming winner and held for second at the wire. EFFECTIVE GIG assumed early command, set
modest fractions into the backstretch run, showed the way into the far turn and was pressured to the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and led to
the furlong marker, was overtaken into the final sixteenth, could not match strides with the top pair into deep stretch and was a clear third. ECOLOGIST
fractious in the starting gate, was forwardly placed in the early running, tracked the pace two then three wide into the first turn, stalked the modest pace from
between rivals heading to the half-mile marker, chased three wide into the second turn, was outkicked into the stretch, could not find the needed late
response and finished evenly. LOOKOUT POINT was away a bit slowly and was unhurried in the early going, raced four then three wide into the first turn,
content to trail heading to the half-mile marker, guided two wide into the second turn, was able to mount a mild rally into the stretch but did not threaten in
the drive. POUR ON THE COLE bobbled at the start, settled outside of rivals and went three to four wide into the first turn, tracked the modest pace while
widest heading to the half-mile marker, chased four wide into the second turn, lacked a response in the stretch and tired in the late stages. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TIGER QUEEN broke alertly and went straight for the lead, was left to dictate the pace under restraint while getting mild pressure from LION'S LAIR to the
outside, was still going well passing the quarter pole and opened when let loose near the quarter pole, easily fended off that rival in the stretch and held
clear in the end. LION'S LAIR came away well and joined TIGER QUEEN on the lead out of the gate, then opted for a stalking position two wide and to the
outside, came into the stretch still very much in contention but had trouble changing leads, got clear and finished well but was not good enough while
holding the place. THE GREAT HAYNES broke well and tracked three wide behind the dueling leaders, held position through the turn and responded when
set down for the stretch run, could not catch the top pair but held third. OUTRAGEOUS lacked speed from the break and was last in the early going,
launched a bid from the three furlong marker, came four wide into the stretch, tipped out another path for the stretch run and finished with some interest but
could not improve. STATEFOREST hustled into contention early raced close up then began to struggle at the five-sixteenths and had little to offer for the
stretch run. LADY RANGER was off a beat slow and lunged outward at the start, rushed up and was prominent to the half mile marker then began a steady
fade and was galloped out to the wire. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
KEEP MOVIN' ON allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run while not far back,
chased two wide and between rivals into the second turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and loomed nearing the furlong marker, drew to even terms
with BABY WAYLON nearing the sixteenth-pole, took command into deep stretch and edged away for the win in the late stages. BABY WAYLON showed
early speed and assumed command away from the start, set the pace into the first turn and was prompted into the backstretch run by RIGHT HAND
RYDER, set moderate fractions while pressured to the half-mile marker, dueled RIGHT HAND RYDER into the far turn, shook free into the stretch and was
set down for the drive, was overtaken by KEEP MOVIN' ON at the sixteenth-marker, could not match strides with the winner into deep stretch and held
safely in the end for second. GROGU tracked the early pace from the second flight, pulled between rivals into the first turn and carried out NOVINOPHOBIA
nearing the six-furlong marker, settled into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace from the outside heading to the half-mile pole, slipped to the
rail entering the far turn and chased from the inside approaching the quarter marker, got caught in tight into upper stretch and drifted at the three-sixteenths,
chased the leading pair to mid-stretch, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and was clear for third at the finish. RIGHT HAND RYDER prominent away
from the start, attended to the early pace while outside of BABY WAYLON entering the first turn, prompted the moderate pace through the backstretch run,
pressed two wide into the far turn, was crowded by a drifting GROGU into upper stretch then got caught in tight while between rivals at mid-stretch,
weakened in the final sixteenth and could not muster a late response. BRAVO RAGAZZO settled outside of runners into the first turn, advanced into the
backstretch run and was well placed while between runners nearing the half-mile marker, chased three to four wide into the far turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch and did not offer a late response. ELEGANT BOY off a step slowly, recovered to be forwardly placed in the early stages, checked in tight
quarters into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace while saving ground into the backstretch run, lost position into the far turn and gave way.
NOVINOPHOBIA took back off of the early pace, settled outside of runners into the first turn, was carried out a path and raced four wide into the backstretch
run, tracked the moderate pace while widest nearing the half-mile marker, chased four to five wide into the far turn, lacked a response into the stretch and
tired in the final furlong. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING INTO UPPER STRETCH AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECSION,
RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to
arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
THIRSTY VISION ducked inward after the break and bumped lightly with EL DIAMANTE NEGRO recovered, and was between five horses contesting the
early pace, emerged from the pack on the turn to challenge PROWLING CAT for the lead at the top of the stretch, battled briefly, got the best of that rival in
mid-stretch then held off a late charge from ACCIDENTAL GENIUS to prevail. ACCIDENTAL GENIUS was off a step slow then raced four wide down the
backstretch with the trailing group a few lengths behind the leaders, started a bid from the three furlong pole three wide, angled in near the three-sixteenths
to avoid a tiring JEFFREY ON THE RUN but made contact with the head of STAR CHIEFTAIN nearly forcing that one into the rail, split horses and once
clear rallied alongside TYPHOON TOMMY, put that foe in tight quarters inside the sixteenths pole, closed with a rush in deep stretch and just missed.
TYPHOON TOMMY was crowded at the start when horses in the adjacent stalls came over into the path, moved over to the rail and immediately went into a
drive, kept to the inside through the turn, accelerated near the quarter pole to get out of a tight spot created by ACCIDENTAL GENIUS then went on with
that rival, drifted out to the five path under left handed urging near the furlong pole then was put in tight once again by ACCIDENTAL GENIUS yards from
the finish but still managed to gain the third spot. PROWLING CAT bobbled at the break but recovered quickly and seized the early lead with several in
pursuit, led the field through the turn, was challenged by the eventual winner at the three-sixteenths pole, battled to mid-stretch then gave way. LAST CALL
VRON veered out at the start then rushed up to join the early fray five wide, launched a bid just past the three furlong pole, came into the stretch five wide,
loomed a brief threat, had trouble changing leads, drifted in and lost momentum in the late stages. BIG BAD BERT raced four wide with the leading group,
dropped off the pace a bit heading into the turn, tried to re-rally from the five-sixteenths pole then flattened out mid-stretch. EL DIAMANTE NEGRO ducked
out after the break and made contact with THIRSTY VISION, was mid-pack just behind the leading group in the early stages then quickly dropped back
through the field, was far behind going into the turn, made a mild late run down the stretch but was only able to pass a pair of stragglers while otherwise
never a threat. JEFFREY ON THE RUN broke a little awkwardly, dueled briefly with PROWLING CAT, came under a ride near the three furlong marker then
dropped off the pace and had nothing to offer in the stretch. STAR CHIEFTAIN raced mostly at the head of the tracking group then was between horses still
near the rear on the turn, was bumped in the head by ACCIDENTAL GENIUS and took up sharply, nearly going into the inner rail and could not recover.
This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

NIGHT PROOF was prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace outside of DRUIDIC, advanced into the backstretch run and prompted that rival
through moderate fractions heading to the half-mile marker, dueled into the far turn, drew to even terms with DRUIDIC into upper stretch and battled that
rival to the furlong marker, took a narrow lead past mid-stretch and dug in entering the final sixteenth, kept DRUIDIC at bay in deep stretch and held for the
win over the oncoming runner-up. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) was forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the early pace three wide into the first turn,
was well placed into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace approaching the half-mile marker, chased three wide into the far turn and advanced
at the quarter marker, made a sustained rally into the stretch, surged in the final sixteenth, just missed for the win in the final strides and got up in time to
secure the place honors. DRUIDIC hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set the pace into the first turn, was engaged by NIGHT
PROOF into the backstretch run and set moderate fractions while prompted nearing the half-mile marker, dueled that rival into the far turn, met the bid of
NIGHT PROOF in upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker, gamely fought into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by the top pair in deep stretch and
held clearly in the end for third. EL JOY took back off of the early pace, raced two to three wide into the first turn and tracked the moderate pace heading to
the half-mile marker, was well placed approaching the far turn, mounted a three to four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could
not muster a final response and finished evenly in the final stages. ROARING TIGER settled off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn,
tracked the moderate pace heading to the half-mile marker, was steered outside of rivals into the far turn, mounted a four then five wide bid at the quarter
pole, ran evenly to mid-stretch and needed more in the final sixteenth. CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the
first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, maintained an inside path into the far turn and advanced at the quarter marker, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, could not find more into the final sixteenth and weakened. CUT ACROSS SHORTY settled off of the early pace while never far back, raced two
wide into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace from the second flight heading to the half-mile marker, saved ground into the far turn and lost position at
the quarter pole, lacked a response into the stretch and gave way. GROSS PROFIT ducked in at the start and was off slowly, trailed in the early running and
saved ground into the first turn, trailed through the backstretch run, gained ground three wide into the far turn, could not sustain that run into the stretch and
did not factor in the late going. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
GALLAND DE BESOS rated nicely off of the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn and improved position at the quarter marker, maintained an inside
position into the stretch, was full of run into the drive and loomed at the furlong marker, overhauled SIR GREYSON approaching the sixteenth-marker and
held in a drive in deep stretch. SIR GREYSON off a step slow leaving the start, was sent in the early going and assumed a narrow lead heading to the
half-mile marker, set a quick pace from the inside while prompted entering the turn, dictated terms to the quarter marker then shook free into upper stretch,
drifted out into the lane, was confronted by GALLAND DE BESOS nearing the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth
and held clearly for second at the finish. TOWN PERFORMER broke alertly and was prominent away from the start, took back off of the solid early pace and
tracked the leading pair heading to the half-mile marker, was well placed approaching the turn and chased three to four wide nearing the quarter marker,
outkicked into the stretch, faded in the final sixteenth but was able to win the nod for third at the finish. REGAL PATRIOT showed good speed away from the
start and vied for early command, ceded the lead to SIR GREYSON and pressed the solid pace outside of that rival heading to the half-mile marker, pressed
the pace two to three wide into the turn, lost position into upper stretch and chased to the furlong marker, weakened in the final sixteenth and just missed for
third at the wire. GERLACH'S lunged at the break and was off slowly, rushed up and tracked the solid early pace while widest heading to the half-mile
marker, chased four to five wide into the turn, raced widest into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker and weakened in the final sixteenth. BLUE
SILVER away in good order, got caught a bit in tight while between runners in the early stages and was shuffled back, trailed heading to the half-mile
marker, went two wide into the turn and trailed to the quarter marker, passed a tired rival in the stretch but was not able to make a late impact. PRIME TIME
PORTA broke a bit awkwardly then was bumped by an inner rival at the start and was away slowly, tracked the solid early pace from between rivals, chased
three wide into the turn, was outrun into the stretch and faltered in the final stages. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
