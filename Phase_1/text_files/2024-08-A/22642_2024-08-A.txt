Footnotes
PALMETTO FURY coaxed from the gate, advanced to duel along the inside of SHE'S ALWAYS ROSIE from five furlongs out, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, shook off that rival and edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to prevail. SHE'S COOL
chased two to three wide before tucking inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up
late foot closing in outside but was it was ultimately not enough when safely staved off at the finish. OH MY MIA coaxed from the gate, chased along the
inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. ANSWER THE CALL three wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SHE'S ALWAYS ROSIE led early on before being
engaged in head to head combat with PALMETTO FURY to the inside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, came under light urging with
three-sixteenths to go and was readily shaken off and weakened through to the wire.

Footnotes
PROPRIETARY TRADE bumped solidly with a rival at the start, was taken in hand when the pacesetter crossed in front outside the five-eighths pole then
rated just off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path while asked on the turn, rallied to the lead in upper stretch then shook clear, responded well
under the crop in the final furlong and held under steady urging. TEMECULA broke out at the start, settled on the outside, was urged along in the three then
two path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, switched to a left-handed crop
outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage under hand-urging in the final sixteenth to safely secure the place. SQUINTS was taken in hand
when the leader crossed in front early then raced just off the pace, went four then five wide while roused on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive
and lacked the needed kick while best of the rest. ETENDRE angled in while going to the front then showed the way, was challenged to his outside with five
furlongs to run, vied inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way. IRIDESCENT was hustled from
the gate then taken in hand briefly inside the three-quarter pole, moved up on the outside to prompt the pace, vied in the three path on the turn, was given
his cue outside the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. APOLLO CODE bumped solidly with a rival at the start,
settled at the rear under some urging, saved ground on the turn, steadied just of the flank of a foe near the five-sixteenths pole, shifted to the four path into
the stretch and failed to threaten.

STARSHIP DEFIANT three wide in pursuit patiently handled, steadily increased the pressure on the leader through the turn, swung four wide into upper
stretch and seized command near the three-sixteenths when roused, edged clear under a drive and held safe kept to task. RACHEL'S ROCK crossed over
to the three path when IT TAKES HEART crossed directly in front and placed ICY REPLY and JACKIE THE JOKER in tight and grew rank under restraint
bumping ICY REPLY five furlongs from home, tipped out to the four path thereafter down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid and was along clear of the rest and second best. WILLOW
BEND broke a beat slow, chased three then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and improved position
to the finish. IT TAKES HEART broke out at the start, crossed to show the way from the two path placing some foes to the inside and behind briefly in tight
nearing the five-eighths, showed the way in hand just off the inside under increasing pressure from STARSHIP DEFIANT and was placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front at the three-sixteenths and weakened in the late stages. ICY REPLY bobbled at
the break, got placed in tight and was bumped at the five furlong marker, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch and tired. JACKIE THE JOKER brushed the off side stall at the start, came under hustling and chased along the inside, got paused when
placed in tight at the five-eighths, came under coaxing continuing along the inside at the three-eighths, remained in the inside route into upper stretch and

Footnotes
SAVE US MELANIA broke out and brushed the gate but came out towards the front, pressed the pace on the outside, dropped from the four path to the
three path early on the turn, took the lead outside the three-eighths pole, moved clear at the five-sixteenths pole, drew off under a strong hand-ride into the
final sixteenth then was eased up late while much the best. COQUITO was last away then dropped well back under urging, went around the turn in the three
to four path, turned into the stretch in the seven path and improved to safely secure the place. THEDREAMCONTINUES settled on the outside, was roused
in the five path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive in the six path and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. YINGLE BELLS
came out after the start and bumped with a foe, was well placed just off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path early on the turn then chased the
leader, turned into the stretch in the four path, remained on her inside lead until inside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead, had the rider
lose his crop at that point and weakened. THAT'STHEFACTJACK bobbled at the start then was bumped early, dropped well back under urging, moved from
the rail to the two path late on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch then angled out and was no factor. DREAMING OF CARLI was urged along off the
pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths pole, went around the turn in the three then four path, was driven into the stretch in the five path and failed to
threaten. BAM BAM was hard ridden off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, spun into the stretch in the two path while under
the crop and failed to respond. NEGRA GATA was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, was headed while dropping from the two
path to the rail early on the turn, lost touch with the winner late on that bend and stopped.

WITHIN VIEW got bumped between foes and pinched back CAN'T STAND DISCO in tandem with WAFLR, tracked the pace along the inside patiently
handled until roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, was under a drive behind the leader with seemingly nowhere to go when JUDGE RULES
shied out slightly under a left handed crop a furlong out, tipped out to the two path and rallied splitting foes through a tight seam between to seize command
inside the sixteenth pole, then inched away to the finish to score. JUDGE RULES broke out at the start bumping WITHIN VIEW against CAN'T STAND
DISCO and pressure outside from WAFLR, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive and came under a left handed crop drifting out a path a furlong out, then offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors.
CHARMING JIM off to a hesitant start, conceded five lengths to the front, chased just off the inside from near the rear coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. MAZZEI established the front shortly after the start and showed the way
rated on the pace just off the inside through the first turn and then along the inside, remained on hold until roused taking the two path into upper stretch,
took to the inside straightened away, dug in under threat from a host of pursuers, got collared inside the sixteenth pole and was outfinished in the late
stages. TONY O just off the inside tracking from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved
position to the finish. SWEET TONE forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. WAFLR broke in at the start bumping CAN'T STAND DISCO and pinched that rival back against
WITHIN VIEW against pressure inside from the outwards breaking JUDGE RULES, tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled out four wide for home and offered no response. CAN'T STAND DISCO got bumped between foes and was pinched back at the
start conceding three to four lengths before settling into stride, chased just off the inside through the first turn and then three wide thereafter, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. CATTANI two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. TRIPLE WORD SCORE got steadied a sixteenth out along the inside after the start, saved
ground at the tail of the field, came under brief and light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed.

LA CARA broke very fast then sped clear, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, responded well when asked into upper stretch and drew off under a
strong-hand ride to prove much the best. GOING STEADY was hustled from the gate then settled in third position, moved into second leaving the
backstretch, was asked in the three path on the turn, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place.
QUICKICK was hustled from the start, raced well back in the field under urging, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, was driven into the
stretch in the five path and improved for the show. TRADING STRATEGY was hustled from the gate, moved in inside the three-quarter pole, raced well off
the pace, saved ground early on the turn, shifted three wide to go around a stopping foe at the three-eighths then dropped back to the two path, turned into
upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. TRANGO TOWER was urged along on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn and
failed to threaten. TEJANITA was urged along well off the pace, raced in the two path on the turn, was bumped in the hindquarters near the five-sixteenths
pole and was no factor. TABLE FLIRT dropped back at the start, angled in inside the three-quarter pole, saved ground early on the turn, bumped with a foe
and checked sharply behind a stopping rival at the five-sixteenths pole, shifted to the three path later on that bend, came into the stretch in the four path and
also was no factor. MIA'S MOM moved out while following the solo leader, was urged along leaving the backstretch, came up empty in the two path on the
turn, retreated quickly to the rear of the field, came into the stretch in the three path and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
CHARGING AERO broke out at the start under coaxing and broke on top despite it, raced five paths off the inside in aim of the front and then three wide
through the turn advancing to apply pressure to the leader in concert with MISTER J T and getting placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung three
wide into upper stretch, got bumped in the hind end and spun inwards by MISTER J T when seizing command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive
and outgamed and outrode his rival to the finish to prevail. MISTER J T coaxed from the start, prompted the leader from the outside four then two wide
between foes through the turn and under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, seized command near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, came out under a left handed crop and bumped his main danger in the hind end to spin him inwards at the three-sixteenths just after relinquishing
the front, dug in under a tepid ride inside through to the finish and was along clear for the place honors. JOKING WAY brushed the near side stall at the start
and then brushed NOTABLE BOB, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild bid. BEACH BOY AL chased six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch devoid of speed early on, tucked to the two path into
the turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, tipped four to five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. NOTTOWAY coaxed
from the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
RIBBONS AND MEDALS coaxed from the gate, showed the way under light coaxing just off the inside and then along the inside, yielded the front near the
quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened through to the finish. NOTABLE BOB (CHI) got brushed at the start by JOKING
WAY, chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.

FANDOM (GB) went to the front then showed the way down the backstretch, was challenged to his outside near the seven-sixteenths pole, vied inside of a
foe in the two path on the turn, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive, fought gamely with multiple opponents in the
final furlong, rubbed saddles with APOLLO TEN late and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. RUN CARSON was asked leaving the gate, stalked the
pace on the outside, made a bid at the seven-sixteenths pole, vied in the three path on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, battled outside of
two foes in the final furlong and just missed while able to get the place. APOLLO TEN was eased back then rated just off the pace, came under urging while
saving ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, made a bid near the three-sixteenths pole, battled between horses in the final furlong,
steadied in crowded quarters while being outfinished late and just earned the show. HOWARD WOLOWITZ was hustled from the gate then settled off the
pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, chased the leader under the crop into the final furlong, steadied
while stymied behind a trio of foes starting outside the sixteenth-pole and lost any chance then just missed the show. WORKS FOR ME settled at the rear of
the field, was roused in the two path on the turn, swung out into the seven path entering the stretch, brushed with a foe while fanned out inside the
three-sixteenths pole, found his best stride in the final furlong and finished with good energy. YELLOW CARD broke out and hit the gate, bobbled inside the
five-eighths pole, was hard held while off the pace, raced under vigorous restraint while off heels late on the backstretch and into the turn, was roused in the
two path later on that bend, came three wide into the stretch then angled out and brushed with a foe, pursued the vanguard to the finish and gained some
but failed to impact. MANSA MUSA (IRE) settled between horses, was asked three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, chased the
vanguard to the finish and lacked the needed kick. REEF RUNNER settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, brushed with a foe while
carried out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. AMERICAN RASCAL was hard held while rated off the pace, dropped back under stout
restraint and lost position late on the backstretch, was roused in the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the six path, brushed with a foe while
fanned out inside the three-sixteenths pole, steadied briefly between horses inside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE

Footnotes
CARL SPACKLER (IRE) established a forward position early, raced in the two path on the first turn, followed the solo leader from second, ranged up in the
two path on the far turn, took the lead while asked into upper stretch, kicked clear inside the three-sixteenths pole, responded well in the final furlong and
proved much the best under a solid hand-ride. MORE THAN LOOKS tossed his head while rank under restraint early, tucked from the three path to the two
path early on the first turn, was reserved on the outside but with cover, was let out in the two then three path on the far turn then roused late on that bend,
came four wide into the stretch and finished with good courage to secure the place. OTTOMAN FLEET (GB) was unsettled just before the break, went
around the turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, traveled around the far turn in the two path while given some free rein, was roused coming to the
quarter-pole then came three wide into the stretch, pursued the leader into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. STRONG QUALITY was hustled to
the front, showed the way on the inside with a clear advantage, was asked near the quarter-pole then lost the lead into upper stretch, dropped back into the
final furlong and weakened. MAJOR DUDE was taken under a snug hold early, tugged keenly on the bit while rated under tight restraint, was given his head
some while inside on the far turn then asked around the five-sixteenths pole, turned into the stretch in the two path, chased under a drive into the final
furlong and came up empty. MONEY SUPPLY reared badly at the start and was off very slow, spotted the front several lengths, saved ground at the rear,
was urged along on the final turn, came off the rail into the stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
CARSON'S RUN saved ground at the tail of the field and pulled on the bit early on before settling into the first turn, tipped to the two path down the
backstretch before tucking back inside near the seven-sixteenths moving to the inside of DETERMINISTIC through that bend patiently handled until placed
to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, angled out five wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish inside the final furlong collaring the leader inside the
sixteenth marker, then edged away in the final strides. LEGEND OF TIME (GB) settled near the rear of the field along the inside early on, tipped two to three
wide down the backstretch and advanced to mid pack before continuing three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled
four wide into upper stretch let out for the drive, took over command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive under growing threat to the outside, got
caught inside the sixteenth pole and was along safe for the place honors. DETERMINISTIC settled tracking the front just off the inside through the first turn
and then two to three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out
six to seven wide into upper stretch roused for the drive, offered up a mild kick closing belatedly for the show honors. ROYAL MAJESTY (GB) coaxed from
the start, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong
out, then kept on one paced to the finish. IZZY D'ORO established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, widened away into the
backstretch before settling to allow the field to take closer order, tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing near the quarter pole under
threat to the outside, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, yielded command with three-sixteenths remaining and weakened to the finish. FULMINEO
just off the inside through the first turn, chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled three
to four wide into upper stretch in the midst of backing away and tired through to the wire.
