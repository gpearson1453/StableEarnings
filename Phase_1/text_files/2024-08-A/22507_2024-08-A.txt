FOLLOW THE FACTS vied to the upper stretch, inched clear and held under urging. QUEENS EFFORT was never far back, swung wide leaving the turn,
found his best stride late, was gaining grosady und and got up for place. BURNZ DA BOSS raced close to the pace, closed steadily, didn't have enough late
and was caught for second. HESA PROSPECTOR stalked the pace, went five wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed late response. POOF HE'S
GONE was away alertly, vied inside, was taken back entering the turn and failed to rally. FACETIOUS vied to the upper stretch, weakened and faded from
contention. GORDY'S RULES was not a factor. BIG MAC DADDY trailed the field.
