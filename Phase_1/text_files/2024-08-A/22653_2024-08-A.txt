stretch, edged ahead, then shook clear and lasted under steady pressure. RIGHT NOW well placed and outside, looped up three wide through the second
turn, bid on that path into the stretch, angled out, made a steady gain and closed the gap on the winner late. GENEVIEVE'S Z VA rated on the lead, stayed
on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. INTO DISCO unhurried, moved up on the two path through the
second turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted in slightly under left hand urging and improved position. CUPID'S STRIKE rated tracking the pace,

Footnotes
PRISCILLA'S COVE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task.
NEEDED stalked the pace on the inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, angled out and closed well for the place. HOPE SHE COMES
well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, evened and gained the show. ASHERAH'S RUN
never far back, moved up inside through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and flattened out. GRACE IN EXCESS mid pack,
looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. SUNSET VIBES allowed to settle, looped three and four
wide through the turn, drifted in mid way of the turn, then came through inside and faded. ELLYMARIE ran evenly for a half and had no stretch rally.
PEDDLING HOPE was never involved. BUILT'IN ABILITY was a brief factor, outside.
