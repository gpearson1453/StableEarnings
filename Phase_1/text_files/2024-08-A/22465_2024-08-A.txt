Footnotes
INSPIRED IRISH back off the early pace while out in the strip, moved closer in the four path into the turn, challenged on the outside of the first flight midway
on the bend, put a head in front just before a half and drove steadily clear through the stretch. MELODY WIN lacked early foot while saving ground turn,
roused for the drive, ran on well through the length of the stretch, finished up willingly to be in time for the place between rivals. SPURS UP away well, set or
forced the pace while closest to the inside, proved no match for the winner when that one assumed command entering the stretch, chased that same foe
past the furlong marker, caught late for the place while remaining inside, narrowly lasted for the show. EL MIC TIESUN fell back to trail after the start, raced
with the runner up outside that one in the rear through the turn, angled out a bit for the drive, angled out widest with less than a furlong to run and displayed
some interest while too late, missed the show. SIMON'S CHOICE broke on top, vied up front between rivals for a half, weakened steadily through the
stretch. BEYOND REPROACH in the second group five wide and outside the winner, crept a bit closer with that one into the turn, lacked a further advance
and also faltered through the stretch. DRUM AND DRUMMER with the lead pack while vying three wide into the turn, first to blink, continued to back up
through the stretch.

Footnotes
RECOGNIZE ME broke back, raced three wide around most of the first turn while outrun, continued unhurried up the backstretch, let out a notch far turn,
roused late in the bend when advancing, got through a large opening turning for home, engaged the leader past the furlong marker and dispatched that one
under firm handling to be clear at the wire. DIAMONDS FOR LILY broke running, showed the way into the first turn by daylight along the inside, continued to
show the way the middle half mile while under light restraint, offered but brief resistance to the winner when that one challenged a furlong out, no match,
remained clear of the others. WICKED LUNA settled in the second flight while racing along the inside, lacked a significant closing response to finish up best
of the rest. BACHELORETTE broke out, was straightened to race closest to the pacesetter, asked into the lane, came up empty for the drive to finish up
evenly. LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS void of speed for six furlongs, angled out for the drive, failed to muster a rally. CAJUN EXPECTATION in the second group
outside, got out late in the final turn when appearing to be giving way, stopped through the stretch.

Footnotes
REGGIE RUNS ROGUE broke back, tracked the leader from along the inside, moved out a bit into the stretch, collared the leader approaching the furlong
grounds, kicked clear under steady handling. SCHRADER away in good order outside, forwardly placed three wide through the turn, could not match strides
with the winner the final furlong, held sway for the place. CASEY N PAP forwardly placed off the inside, three wide into the lane, long drive for the show
spot, determined at the wire. BOLD ROCK fell back after the start, moved off the inside, steered out turn, four wide for the drive, displayed some mild
interest to improve position, outkicked late for the show. GANGSTER broke sharp, showed the way into the turn along the inside, continued to hold the
advantage into the stretch, faltered when headed by the winner soon after. MILLIBAR last to leave, continued to lack speed while steered out five wide early
in the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. BUTHESPRETTY fell back after the start and was not a threat. DEDICATED
HERO raced in mid pack and four wide through the turn, lacked a closing response. BISHOP MEADE broke back, continued to lag while well out in the strip,
five wide through the turn, showed little life through the stretch.

IT'S WITCHCRAFT forwardly placed along the inside behind the dueling leaders, patiently handled while covered up through the turn, moved out to the two
path turning for home, bid between foes, spirited duel to the wire, proved game to be narrowly best. FUNNY LADY broke out, in the second flight while
outside the winner, floated out while four wide exiting the turn, challenged outside, dueled the final furlong, outgamed at the wire. BELLE OF THE SOUTH
dueled up front along the inside, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, could not match the top two the final sixteenth while steering out off the rail,
stayed on for the show. PRINCESS ATTITUDE hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, continued to trail turn, staged a mild rally better
position a bit. ABUNDANT LOVE raced off the pace in lacking speed, failed to muster a closing response when asked. HEARTFULL OF JOY dueled up
front off the inside, gave exiting the turn, continued to fade to trail home.
