Footnotes
DREAM GOLD was hustled along outside rivals from the beginning, three wide taking the turn, took over midstretch, soon moved clear with mild urging and
was allowed to coast the last fifty yards. TRY vied for the lead inside horses from the start, was no match for DREAM GOLD the last eighth, fought to keep
second and gradually edged ahead inside the final furlong. COALY disputed the pace just outside TRY, also could not stay with DREAM GOLD the last
furlong, slowly yielded for second but was easily best of the others. STEVE broke somewhat slowly and inward, chased from just off the inside and had no
late bid. SOMETHINTOBELIEVEN was bumped at the break, angled in entering the bend, moved back out upper stretch and had little to offer.
HARLEY'SRUNAWAYKID broke inward, bumping SOMETHINTOBEIEVEN, chased from outside, angled in on the turn and was empty for the stretch run.

HOLY STAR rated toward the outside the first quarter mile, was roused going to the bend, circled rivals, drew off under urging upper stretch, was ridden out
after that and was being wrapped up the final fifty yards. HER SPEAKER'S ON contested the pace outside horses, angled in some midway on the turn, was
no match for HOLY STAR in the lane but maintained second. SPIRIT SMOKE vied for the lead between foes, gained the rail midway on the bend then
lacked a significant stretch bid. W W LAST HURRAH a bit rank and slow at the start, chased from outside, was just off the inside on the turn, angled out four
wide for the stretch run, also failed to have a serious stretch response but was easily best of the others. SNOW GLO a step slow at the break, stayed well
off the inside throughout and showed little. HIGHLAND GIRL was also away slow, rushed up to vie for the lead from inside but gave way on the bend.

REBA ATTACK pressed the early speed while toward the outside, was four wide on the bend, swung out widest for the stretch run and swept past TENSE
inside the seventy yard marker. TENSE set a pressured pace between rivals, was challenged from outside on the turn, moved clear and angled in some
entering the lane, drew off upper stretch but began to wear down deep stretch. WILDWOOD TRIPLE a step slow at the start, was just off the inside taking
the turn, fanned outside TENSE for the drive, threatened between rivals with a furlong to go, lacked the needed late kick but edged ahead for the show.
GOLDICAT was also a step slow at the break, soon raced in contention from inside but gradually wore down for the drive. BIG SALLY overcame a slow start
to press the early leader from outside, vied for the lead from path four on the bend but could not sustain her bid for the stretch run.

BLAME TERI was taken outside early on, rated off the pace, let out four wide on the bend, edged ahead midstretch then drew off under urging. DIXIE
PENNY in the second flight between rivals on the backstretch, went for the lead three on the turn, dueled inside BLAME TEN, was no match for that one the
last furlong but easily second best. TAPICITA broke a bit slow and outward, raced in the second flight from inside then wore down for the stretch run.
AWESOME BIRDIE was soon clear of the others after the start, showed the way just off the inside, was challenged from outside on the turn and gave way
for the drive.

TAPINYOURBLUEJEANS broke inward, bumped solidly with SPAN, was kept close outside the early speed, went for the lead three wide on the turn,
moved clear into the lane, angled in some, dug in through the late going and kept SPAN at bay. SPAN unruly in the gate, broke outward, bumped solidly
with TAPINYOURBLUEJEANS, was settled outside, lost ground widest through the bend, rallied outside rivals in the stretch, took over second inside the
last eighth, closed well but was too late. STANCE angled in some after the break, bumped RUN THE TABLE leaving the chute, vied for the lead outside
RUN THE TABLE then inside TAPINYOURBLUEJEANS on the turn, could not stay with that one entering the lane, angled outside TAPINOURBLUEJEANS
midstretch, slowly yielded but was clearly best of the rest. RUN THE TABLE bumped leaving the chute, disputed the pace from inside, began to wear down
before finishing a half mile, angled out upper stretch and continued to gradually fade. BEST MAN SPEECH was away slowly then failed to menace in a
ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
GOLD SMOKE settled off the early speed, picked up his pace after a half mile, advanced from path three on the second bend, started drifting out under
left-handed pressure as he took the advantage midstretch, continued to gradually float out but drew off the final sixteenth. NULLARBOR broke alertly, was
quickly clear of the others and taken to the rail nearing the first turn, showed the way in hand, was let out on the second bend, gradually drifted out despite
right-handed pressure as he began to wear down in the lane but was easily second best. CREPE YARNS broke outward, bumping WHAT A COUNTRY,
was settled inside, commenced his bid along the rail leaving the second turn, edged ahead for third inside the final eighth, drifted out in the waning yards but
lasted for the show. WHAT A COUNTRY bumped at the break, trailed, staying off the inside, was three to five wide taking the second bend and showed a
willingness to run late between rivals. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS chased from outside, advanced three wide on the second turn, fanned outside PAYNT BY
LETTERS for the drive, drifted out upper stretch, was straightened, fought for third in the waning yards but was outfinished. PAYNT BY LETTERS raced
closest to NULLARBOR while not far off the inside for six furlongs, had a striking position just off the rail on the second bend, angled outside GOLD SMOKE
upper stretch and began to fade between rivals. CITY OF GOD chased from just off the rail and gave way the last two furlongs.

Footnotes
ORNERY ANGEL a step slow at the start, gradually angled to the outside on the backstretch, reached contention three wide on the bend, fanned out further
for the drive, took over upper stretch, moved clear inside the last eighth, gradually lugged in through the late going but held on. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE
moved to the inside early on, did not keep up along the rail through the turn, rallied in the lane, gained second inside the final furlong, closed well but was
too late. JULIAISON raced in contention between rivals, was two wide taking the bend, steadied in tight quarters between ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE and
ABBMAR as the latter began to faded inside the last furlong and could only pull clear inside the final sixteenth. ABBMAR was sent to a clear early lead,
showed the way from inside, floated out into the lane, drifted out slightly upper stretch, was overtaken and continued to gradually yield between rivals. MUD
HUT was away slowly, moved up from outside to prompt the pace from just outside, began to fade leaving the turn, angled outside ORNERY ANGEL upper
stretch and slowly yielded. GREER CROSSING was also away slowly, raced in contention just off the inside on the backstretch but faded two wide on the
bend. WARM BEAUTY away somewhat slowly as well, was soon well back, angled out widest upper stretch and had no significant response.
