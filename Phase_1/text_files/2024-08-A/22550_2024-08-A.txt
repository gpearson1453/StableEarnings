THIRTY OYSTERS Away on top, toyed with BIG HUTCHY for a half mile, disposed of that one without asking into the last turn, quickly opened up a large
lead and then padded that with a furlong to go while proving clearly the best. DRINKING SOLO Unhurried removed from the rail, responded inside and
earned the place. DANCINWITHJAKE Unhurried four wide, five wide into the lane and finished with interest. CAMBU In hand along the three path, four wide
entering the final turn, lodged a bid five wide into the lane, continued wide and flattened out. BENCH PRESS Saved ground to no avail. BIG HUTCHY Vied
for the lead along the rail for a half mile, tracked into the last turn and tired.
