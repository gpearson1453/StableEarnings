Footnotes
HONEST ANGUS challenged for the early lead, dueling with EVERLYN'S ANGEL, took the advantage leaving the final turn, pulled away and proved the
best. NO COST raced within striking distance, moved to the outside entering the home stretch, made a bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear
second. WORLD OF HURT unhurried in the beginning, saved ground around the final turn, made a mild bid and proved no match for the top two. COSTA
LADY void of early speed and was never a factor. EVERLYN'S ANGEL went to the front, saved ground and dropped to the rear.

Footnotes
WORLD WAR raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the second turn, rallied down the lane, drove clear and finished well. DAISY
DE ORO challenged for the early advantage, racing outside around the first turn, took the lead at the 3/4 pole, but proved no match for the winner down the
lane. BEAUTIFULNAVIGATOR (IRE) pressed the pace, made a late bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for show. ROSIE'S ANGUS vied for the
early lead, checked around the second turn, getting in tight quarters, made a wide bid down the stretch and was outfinished for third. AKIANE'S SOLDIER
lacked early speed, checked around the final turn, to avoid troubled rival and was never a threat. CRYSTAL D'ORO went to the front, saved ground and
faded. HAL'S DREAM always raced near the back, saved ground around the final turn and showed little. THE JOCKEY OF #2 AKIANE'S SOLDIER
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #6 ROSIE'S ANGUS AND #6 LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #3 BEAUTIFULNAVIGATOR FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2ND TURN. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

STREET ART went to the front, saved ground, drove clear down the home stretch and was kept to the task. OVERTAXED challenged for the early
advantage, forwardly placed throughout, but proved no match for the winner. OUR FREDDIE MAC pressed the pace, raced four wide around the turn,
lacked a late kick and held on for third. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn, made a wide gain and was outfinished for
third. HALF OURS N STORMY showed early speed and weakened. COACH KENNY raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. THE FEATURE
raced near the back, had a wide trip and showed little. RISKTAKER broke poorly, raced near the back and was never a threat.

Footnotes
CALIBRACHOAMATTERS sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground and was kept to the task. APRIORITY AVENGER raced in the middle of the field,
moved up around the turn off the rail, angled out entering the stretch, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SABERMAN lacked early
speed, made a steady gain, came up the rail, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. BACK BAYOU pressed the early pace, forwardly placed
throughout and lacked a late kick. GATSBY'S FORTUNE raced within contention, came around the turn on the outside and finished evenly.
GILDERSLEEVE lacked early speed, showed late interest, while finishing wide, but was no factor. PATIO'S PORCH showed early speed and faded down
the stretch. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS raced within striking distance, came around the turn wide and retreated. KIT KAT KIDD brushed at the start, raced in the

Footnotes
TDZSHININLUCKYSTAR pressed the pace, moved up down the backside, took the lead entering the final turn, opened down the home stretch, was all out
and held off a late charging EL DINERO for the win. EL DINERO unhurried in the early going, racing inside, lacked running room around the final turn,
angled to the outside, closed fast down the home stretch and needed more ground. SAINT GABRIEL showed early speed, was forwardly placed throughout
and proved no match for the top two. STEEL ARGUMENT dueled on the front end, saved ground, faded and finished evenly. STOVALL raced near the back
in the early going, moved up at the 3/4 pole and hung down the lane. PARTY AT JAYS void of early speed and was never a threat. ALLONANITA'SLUCK
pressed the early pace, raced outside around the first turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
LOUISIANA JESS pressed the pace, racing three wide around the turn, took command, pulled away and proved the best. YORKTOWN PANTHER lacked
early speed, moved up on the inside around the turn, angled out entering the stretch, proved no match for the winner, while finishing willingly and was a
clear second at the wire. BIG RASEE broke in start, sprinted to the front, forwardly placed throughout, while saving ground and tired. HAWIJA raced within
striking distance and finished evenly inside. REGAL TEMPLE lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor. DISTINCTLY GOLDEN reared at the start,
racing in the rear, moved up to the middle of the field, hung and was no threat late. LONE WARRIOR void of early speed and was never close. BEACH
TRIPPIN always raced near the back and showed little. MAYBE EYE'LL CALL showed brief speed and retreated to the rear.
