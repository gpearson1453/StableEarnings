THISTIMERANDY tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, lacked a bid and tired. FAST PAYDAY raced off the pace and did not factor.
MAGNIFICENT RIDE stalked close up two wide, bid between rivals entering the far turn and gave way in the stretch.

dueled three wide for the lead, then dueled two wide, took over on the far turn, hooked up with BINGO'S BOY for the stretch run, battled heads apart,
drifting out bumping that rival and dug in gamely to the finish. IRISH MEADOW raced five wide early, then settled two wide off the pace, moved up five wide
on the far turn and rallied mildly outside for third. LIB'S CONTENTO raced off the pace inside, moved up four wide on the far turn, angled in at the top of the
lane and lacked a stretch rally. MICRO BREWSKY broke out bumping a rival at the start, chased between rivals, three wide on the far turn, came two wide
into the lane and weakened. AMORE D'ORO dueled inside for the lead, chased on the far turn and faded. TOWN KISSER chased inside, chased on the
turn and faded. MIDNIGHT STORY broke through the gate prior to a delay for a loose horse, then dueled between rivals, then chased and gave way. After a
