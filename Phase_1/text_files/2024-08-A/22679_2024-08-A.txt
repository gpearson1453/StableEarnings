Footnotes
GOODMENARESCARCE stalked the pace early on, took over command nearing the lane, was in the three path into the lane and drew off down the lane
while geared down in the final stages. PROBATIONER chased the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane and rallied down the lane for place
while no match for the winner. CINCAZUL set the pace early, was in the two path into the lane and faltered in the stretch run. BAYTOWN BULLEIT was
steadied along early on from between horses, tracked the pace down the backstretch, was in the two path into the lane and faded down the lane. BAMBY
BOOM was through after a half. MORALLY was in tight and clipped heels a bit after the start, outrun. BOLD HERO was steadied early on from the rail and
was never a factor.

ZIGGZAPPA was unhurried early on, raced in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane and ran down the leader in the final stages. LEMON BOMB
chased the pace early on, went on by near the five sixteenths pole, cleared nearing the lane, widened near the eighth pole but shortened up near the
sixteenth pole and was ran down in the final stages. DICHOTOMY stalked the pace early on, was on the inside into the lane and flattened out late in the
stretch run. BLOSSOMING set the pace early, was in the two path into the lane and faltered late in the stretch drive. JUST PASSING THRU raced back
early on, was in the four path into the lane while making a bid but leveled off late in the stretch. I LIKEM raced along the inside in the first turn, was in the
four path into the lane and never a factor. Q BOND raced three wide along the first turn, pressed the early pace, was in the three path into the lane and
faded late.

Footnotes
MOUNT CRAIG dueled early on from the inside, took over command entering the lane from the inside and drew off down the lane under a steady drive.
OATHBREAKER chased the dueling leaders early on, raced in the three path into the lane and rallied late in the stretch for place. ONORE was bumped at
the start, raced two wide along the first turn, was in the four path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. MEMPHIS PHAROAH broke out at the
start, dueled early two wide, inched clear nearing the lane but was overtaken into the lane and faltered down the lane. FUNSTRUCK was never a factor.
MORE HOT SAUCE was never a threat. WYOMING CLASS broke slowly and was outrun. YOSHIDA'S IMPACT was never involved. KLIMTSTER was
done early.
