HEAVY POUR stalked the early pace on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the second turn, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and
was kept to the task. HOLD MY BEER BRO sprinted to a clear lead quickly, held sway unchallenged to the second turn, then was no threat to the winner
and held the place safe. MACKENZIE'S NOVVA never far back, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, drifted out slightly into the stretch,

Footnotes
EVERY LITTLE BIT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway unchallenged, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. TUDOR PEAK
rated inside, held position through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then was no threat to that one, while clearly best of the rest.
GREEN CHILE unsettled in the gate, was well placed outside, lost some ground three wide through the turn, angled in and came through inside into the
stretch, then made a steady gain and edged up for the show. CHEROKEE CHATTER tracked the pace, angled out and moved up two and three wide
through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then weakened and held a share. REAL GOOD VYBZ passed a tiring rival. SAILOR'S
SALUTE steadily lost ground.

HEY PADRE stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the second turn, shook clear into the stretch, then lasted under steady
pressure. JO JO HANS mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the
needed late kick. SIR TERRE allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, angled out for clear racing
room and closed well for the show. SWITHER'S SHORTCUT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second
turn, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. PATRIOT DRIVE well placed and outside, lost some position three wide through the second turn,
came four wide into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. HEIRLOOM KITTEN mid pack and inside, gained position through the second turn, was
blocked into the stretch, waited, came through and weakened. LEGIO ran evenly. J P CORNETTA mid pack, moved up outside down the backstretch, then

Footnotes
LUCIOS ZORAN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then lasted under steady pressure. WHISKEY
OR WINE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch, angled out three wide, made a steady gain and lacked the
needed late kick. DIAMONDHARD STONE well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the second turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and
evened out. HOLLYWOOD HERO unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled out for clear
racing room and edged up for a share. TIMO rated outside the leader, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside that
one into the stretch, then drifted in and weakened. BLUE SOLDIER mid pack, lost some ground on the two path through the second turn, fanned four wide
into the stretch and ran evenly. BROMISTA showed little. AMERICA LIVES broke a step slowly from the gate and was no factor. MAGNUS EFFECT well
placed, steadily lost ground.
