Footnotes
K KAKE POP prompted the pace outside SHARED AUTHORITY, gained command on the turn, opened up leaving the turn and was under brisk urging in
the drive. HATEFUL stalked the pace racing near the inner rail to mid turn, swung four wide at the head of the stretch and rallied. KAPATUDE , three deep
on the turn, chased the winner to mid stretch and weakened. EMM ESS EH , bumped by SHARED AUTHORITY leaving the starting gate, swung to the five
path in upper stretch and was no factor. DIVINE SPIRIT saved ground around the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and was no factor. POLICE
WOMAN lacked speed, worked between horses through the stretch and passed tired ones. SHARED AUTHORITY bumped EMM ESS EH when bearing in
at the break, sped to the early lead, hugged the rail around the turn and gave way in upper stretch. DIVINE MAGIC stayed along the inner rail on the turn,
moved out for the drive, raced between horses and gae way.

Footnotes
HARMONIZING prompted the pace three wide outside the leader, moved in hand to apply more pressure mid turn, poked a head in front heading to the
quarter pole, responded to firm asking and kicked clear leaving the three sixteenths, kept on under solid handling inside the sixteenth pole and just held off
an inside charge from BAILINTIN. BAILINTIN , bumped a the break, lagged off the pace while under urging off the rail, gathered momentum and advanced
three wide in upper stretch, worked her way between rivals from the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker, dove inside, closed sharply and just missed.
STORMY MIDNIGHT drifted out at the break, corrected and rated forwardly while saving ground, was put to coaxing mid turn, angled four wide into the
stretch, straightened to make a run at the winner in mid stretch, churned on from there but was out kicked by inner foes. DUELA DENT broke outward,
corrected and sped clear early while two wide, was joined from her outside mid turn, battled to mid stretch then weakened late. JUST THE THING , bumped
and steadied when in tight at the break, saved ground throughout, made a run near mid stretch then flattened out. MOLLY OF STRATFORD , four wide with
pursuit into and around the turn, shifted wider for the drive but came up empty. RUMINT edged up between rivals into the turn, chased three wide around
the turn then weakened in upper stretch.

LEM ME DRINK , a forward factor in the two path around the turn, closed inside horses the final furlong, gained a short lead inside the sixteenth pole and
prevailed. CHANNEL LOOP lacked speed, swung to the four path turning for home, drifted in slightly near the sixteenth pole and rallied. SHORT SKIRTS
brushed with EASTER SUNDAY GIRL at the start, remained along the inner rail on the turn, eased off the rail in upper stretch and was checked in narrow
quarters behind horses near the sixteenth pole. ITALIAN WAR CRY sped a lengthy lead entering the turn, raced near the rail in upper stretch and drifted out
near the sixteenth pole when weakening. EASTER SUNDAY GIRL brushed with SHORT SKIRTS leaving the starting gate, moved up three deep entering
the turn, was well placed in hand approaching the stretch, failed to respond when asked, faltered and was eased late. An objection by the rider of SHORT
SKIRTS against CHANNEL LOOP for alleged interference in the stretch run was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch drive but
no action was taken.

STICKWITHTHECOLORS broke very sharp and was almost a length clear a stride or two out, raced under rating two wide while handling some inner
pressure heading to the half, spurted clear leaving the far turn then was nursed along, responded when put to firm asking in upper stretch, kept on under a
drive leaving mid stretch and held firm to the wire. KILO ROAD edged up early and prompted the pace to the inside of the winner, eased back off that one
past the half, remained inside and stayed close while coaxed along, angled three wide soon into the lane to have aim, gave game chase but had to settle for
second. DAZZY , bumped at the break, eased back from between rivals early, was caught three wide between runners leaving the far turn, altered out to
about six wide in upper stretch, churned on with interest and nabbed the show outside TRUE SUNSHINE. TRUE SUNSHINE bumped with DAZZY leaving
the gate, garnered a forward spot saving some ground into the turn, angled five wide for the drive but lacked a serious finish. BONDIVA edged up early and
prompted three wide, shifted four wide under asking to pursue in upper stretch, failed to kick on and faded. BUCKIN' GREAT hopped at the break, lost
ground four wide outside rivals, had no response nearing the lane and weakened. MY SUGAR BOO was outrun.

Footnotes
ROANAN GODDESS , taken to rate just off the inside and well within range, edged up between rivals leaving the half mile marker, eased out four wide and
cruised up approaching the stretch to take dead aim on CALL ANOTHER PLAY, wrested command soon after, eagerly pulled away while under a steady
drive leaving the furlong grounds then switched over to her left lead while relaxed a bit late. CALL ANOTHER PLAY went clear early and set a slow pace
two wide, came under pressure as the winner ranged up past the three eighths, failed to contain that one leaving the quarter pole, stayed willingly under a
hearty ride past mid stretch, faded late but managed to save the place. DISTORTED D'ORO stalked inside, was under a ride chasing the leaders into the
lane, remained towards the rail and kept on with effort. MADAME MISCHIEF stumbled at the break to be away last, regrouped and moved up leaving the
chute to stalk three wide, failed to kick on under a ride nearing the lane, faltered and was eased late.

MALIBU BEAUTY , right to the early lead, stayed along the inner rail, was challenged mid way on the far turn, battled to the sixteenth pole then asserted
herself and drew off under brisk urging. SADDLE UP JESSIE stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the two path to challenge for the lead mid
way on the far turn, dueled to the sixteenth pole and was not good enough. EVIDENCIAS (BRZ) , a forward factor along the inner rail on the first turn, raced
in the two path the far turn and gradually weakened through the stretch. LEXA , unhurried early, raced along the inner rail for most of the trip and retreated
through the stretch. INTREPID DREAM broke awkwardly, lost ground around both turns and was outrun. AFFIRMATIVE LADY broke awkwardly, raced
three wide the first turn and faltered leaving the backstretch.

Footnotes
GIVE IT A WHIRL vied outside WINE COLLECTOR into the first turn then edged clear leaving the seven eighths, set a rated pace off the inside through the
backstretch run and into the far turn, responded to strong encouragement soon into the stretch, wandered outward a bit while under strong right handed
asks leaving the eighth pole then held firm to deny MUGATU. MUGATU , soundly bumped by TREVESSO leaving the gate, regrouped and edged up off the
inside into the first turn, lost ground four wide from the three quarter pole, took closer order under a ride and to the outside of CINDER BLOCK past the
three eighths, gave valiant chase through the lane but failed to make serious inroads through the final seventy yards. CINDER BLOCK was rated back to the
inside of the leaders heading towards the first turn, angled three wide soon after and tracked, was under a heavy drive leaving the far turn, angled towards
the rail with pursuit into the lane, lacked a punch in mid stretch and faded. WINE COLLECTOR vied inside the winner into the first turn, eased back off that
one leaving the seven eighths, remained forward into the far turn, failed to go on under a ride past the five sixteenths and weakened. TREVESSO stumbled
badly and outward at the break bumping with MUGATU, regrouped to settle off the rail behind the leaders through the backstretch, failed to respond around
the final turn and faded.

Footnotes
EL MAYO broke alertly and quickly went clear, was kept in the two path around the turn and readily pulled away through the stretch while under pressure.
FEAR NOTHING , three wide around the turn, chased the winner, was no match for that one and held the place. FLASHY DUDE lacked speed, swung to
the four path leaving the turn and failed to sustain his rally. BAD MAMMER JAMMER , off last, rushed up down the backstretch, chased the pace while
along the inner rail and tired in mid stretch. FLATBED FORD came in leaving the starting gate, remained along the inner rail and was no factor.
ECLIPTICAL ZIP , steadied when squeezed back by FLATBED FORD soon after the start, was outrun. GRAY CHARLES , four wide on the turn, gave way
approaching the stretch and was eased.
