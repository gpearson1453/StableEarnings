Footnotes
NOMI LACKEE set the pace under pressured from MEAN SHARON while racing two-wide and gradually edged clear late. NEISSA was close-up early
racing along the inside, swung out to be three-wide entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally for the place. MEAN SHARON prompted the issue from
along the inside, was unable to stay with the winner during the drive but held on well for third. CONFIDENCE BUILDER was prominently placed while racing
three-wide on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. MIST OONA B was allowed to settle, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to
seriously threaten. MISCHIEF MAMA threw her head over the side of the gate into the next stall as the gate opened to get away well behind her field and
was unable to recover the lost ground. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS RULED THAT
THE INCIDENT INVOLVING MISCHIEF MAMA OCCURED SIMULTAINIUSLY TO THE BREAK AND THAT SHE WAS AFFORDED A FAIR START AND
MADE NO CHANGED IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
PEDAL TO THE METAL was forwardly placed while racing two-wide, rallied between horses into the stretch, came in slightly to brush with NIGHT TO
REMEMBER nearing the eighth pole and then was up in the final sixteenth to win going away. NIGHT TO REMEMBER saved ground while being allowed to
settle, slipped through entering the stretch then came out slightly to brush with PEDAL TO THE METAL nearing the eighth pole and finished well for second
in a strong effort. PASS THE CROWN saved ground setting the pace, drifted out three-wide nearing the three-sixteenths pole and held on well for third. ICE
TOWER prompted the pace from along the outside, was four-wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed late response. SOLDATNA was reserved off
the early pace while racing three-wide and failed to seriously threaten. SUPER CREATIVE saved ground while being unhurried and failed to be a factor.
THE TRAINER IF NIGHT TO REMEMBER LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST PEDAL TO THE METAL BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE
STEWARDS RULED THERE WAS MUTUAL INTERFERENCE AND MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
RAFANELLI dueled for the lead with SCATALICIOUS and DON'T TELL HYDEE from along the inside and was fully extended to prevail narrowly in a
prolonged drive. DON'T TELL HYDEE disputed the issue from the outset while racing three-wide and just missed in a stiff drive. LEMON DROP LADY was
forwardly placed while racing four-wide and closed strongly. DANSMETOTHENDOFLOV was prominent early while racing five-wide, angled in to be
three-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished well in a steady effort. SCATALICIOUS dueled for the early lead from between horses and weakened.
GOLD COAST GIRL broke out then steadied shortly after the start and was unhurried, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten.
