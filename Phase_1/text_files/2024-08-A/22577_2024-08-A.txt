NEVER SWAY tracked five wide through the backstretch, advanced outside in the final turn, gained the advantage at the head of the stretch and edged
clear. BEAUTIFUL MESS saved ground inside, found a seam inside approaching the stretch, and was along late for place. TELLTALE prompted the pace
while three wide, rallied between into the lane, and weakened deep stretch. PRETTY ARIA set the pace from the two path, and yielded in the stretch. The
Official Veterinarian reported NEVER SWAY as having bled.

TICKET TO THE TOP broke alertly, contended the early pace inside, drove clear at the top of the stretch and was ridden out. NORTHERN FORCE was
unhurried while four to five wide, lodged a bid at the quarter pole but was no match for the eventual winner and held for place. DOUG'S HERO hurried
outside early, bid at the quarter pole and went evenly through the stretch. TAYLOR FIELD was gapped leaving the backstretch and offered a late mild bid.
HARBOR DANCER fanned four wide leaving the backstretch, and had nothing let in reserve for the drive. CAPE COMANDER contested the front in the
backstretch and stopped.

Footnotes
SAXON SAGA broke alertly then emerged the leader into the backstretch, showed the way under a snug grip, responded to a looming threat from EL
NOBLE, and held under a late drive. BODEMONSTER was allowed to settle off the early pacesetters, advanced quickly outside in the final turn, closed
belatedly and missed. EL NOBLE raced three wide in the opening turn, sat in striking range while five wide, moved up menacingly nearing the quarter pole,
but was unable to improve position late. MOUNT ASGARD trailed and bid belatedly. VICTORIA'S CHIEF raced wide into the opening turn, and produced a
mild late bid from the rail. HE'S A SAINT rated off the pace from the rail, and lacked a closing response. STREET VENDOR stalked the pace with three to
four wide, and faded.

Footnotes
BLING DANCER quickly went to the front, was under a snug hold leaving the backstretch, was given her cue at the quarter pole and held under a late drive.
ASAMATTEROFFACTIDO tracked the pacesetter while five wide, chased the leader into the stretch and missed after a good late effort. WHO'S THAT
BABY steadied inside when leaving the backstretch, and rallied belatedly to earn show. JODEYS LIL PAIN settled outside in the backstretch, drove four to
five wide at the head of the lane, and flattened late stretch. MARAMAX was in close quarters into the far turn, lodged a rail bid and yielded. MORNING RAIN
was gapped leaving the backstretch, and never reached contention. SADIE MY LADY raced in closest pursuit while three wide, and was done early.

Footnotes
COUNTRIFIED was five wide entering the backstretch, responded to vigorous handling through the drive and was along in time. CREDIBILITY vied inside,
tracked the pace while three wide, went in pursuit of the leader nearing the quarter pole, gained a slim advantage over CAB SAV and was caught late. CAB
SAV vied outside for the early lead, drew clear through the backstretch, and responded to the challenge from CREDIBILITY but was unable to sustain and
gave way. AMEER closed steadily late. THE BEAT chased inside, and faded late stretch. VIATURE rallied late. PARKING PERMIT lacked a bid.
LONESOME CAT never reached contention.

pursuit of the leader, grabbed the lead near the three sixteenth marker, battled between foes into the stretch, rider lost crop at the eighth pole and was
narrowly denied. JUMEIRAH COAST roused at the three sixteenth pole, angled out to the four path, and evened out. MR. PICKLES passed tiring rivals.

Footnotes
VARATTI gained closer order inside through the backstretch, swung out four wide at the quarter pole, and won going away. READYTOTAPNSING tracked
four to five wide, drove five wide at the top of the stretch, rallied three wide through the stretch and inched up for place. WALKTHELINE sat just off the pace
from the four path, moved up alongside KEEN FLATTER at the quarter pole to challenge the front, rallied between and was bested late for second. KEEN
FLATTER vied inside for the early lead, was under attack in the final turn, rallied inside through the stretch and weakened late. RAILWAY reserved off the
early pacesetters, and lodged a mild bid. POINT TO THE STARS bid belatedly. SIR BREGOVIC reared leaving the gate, was gapped and passed tiring
rivals. SQUALOTORO failed to menace. RUMOHR REIGNS offered little. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the
race involving SIR BREGOVIC, after a review of the films SIR BREGOVIC was deemed to have had a fair start and no change was made.

BEAUTIFUL CALL raced wide in the backstretch, rallied between foes entering the stretch, responded late and was along in time. BURNING UP broke
sharply, contended the early pace outside of MILITARY SASS, dueled in the final turn, gained a short advantage and was rundown late. DRAMATIC FLAIR
hustled outside, chased in the final turn, rallied outside into the stretch, and was outkicked. SUNBIZ tracked the early pacesetters while wide, and lacked the
rally needed in the stretch. MILITARY SASS contested the early pace, dueled inside of BURNING UP in the final turn, was unable to move on with rival and
gave way. SPOT ON JOLEE raced wide early, and lacked a bid. BETTOR BET'R showed little. WICKED WIZZY showed little. STARMA crowded leaving,
saved ground inside, and lacked a bid. ALBERTA was outrun throughout.
