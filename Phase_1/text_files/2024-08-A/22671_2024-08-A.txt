HIGHEST MEMORIES led in the two path and lasted under steady handling. POSITIVE CHANGE stalked the pace inside, bid at the quarter pole but
couldn't get past the winner while in tight. CORONA GRANDE pressed the pace outside of the winner and yielded at the eighth pole. CRINGE stalked the
pace in the four path and lacked a late bid. DADDYS DREAM raced in the three path, fading in the stretch. DATTTS LIFE trailed, bid in the five path on the
far turn but faltered. ROYAL ICING was through early. NO PROOF stalked the early pace between rivals and gave way near the three-quarters pole. THE
STEWARDS DISALLOWED AN OBJECTION BY THE TRAINER OF POSITIVE CHANGE AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH.
