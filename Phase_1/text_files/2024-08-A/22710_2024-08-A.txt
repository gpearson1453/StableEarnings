JUSTASTROLLIN took over the lead soon after the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm around the turn, saved ground entering upper
stretch, roused for more, responded, dug in gamely and held late. STROLLNTOTHEMARKET tracked the pacesetter in the opening quarter and continued
just off rival around the turn, hustled along two wide into upper stretch, advanced to race in striking distance, was inching up late but failed to reel in the
leader in time. A BRUSH OF LUCK was forwardly placed in early stages, picked up the pace late on the turn, ran on three paths wide into stretch and
evened out in the final furlong. NATIVE HELLRAISER got bumped back at the start and remained well off the early pace, cut the corner entering upper
stretch and improved position without threatening. UNCLE SINGH raced in range along the outside, was ridden along four wide into upper stretch then gave
way. APOLLO BAY trailed throughout.

KANTIRUN broke on top then conceded position and raced three wide into the first turn, was well placed sitting just off the embattled duo up the
backstretch, moved up entering the far turn, took over a slim lead, continued to dig in gamely under right handed pressure a furlong out, held a slight edge
over game running DEVILS SHADOW and held in final stride. DEVIL'S SHADOW vied inside of BIG TAP around the first turn and up the backstretch, got
headed by KANTIRUN entering the far turn, remained in close contention, cut the corner entering upper stretch, dug in gamely, moved up into striking
distance along the rail but could not get by the winner in time. BIG TAP vied outside of DEVILS SHADOW around the first turn and up the backstretch, got
overtaken by the winner entering the far turn, briefly flattened out then made a solid three wide rebid in the lane. IRISH COAST raced in range along the
outside, moved up to race in aim for the lead approaching the quarter pole then flattened in the lane. CARGO PANTS trailed in back throughout.

Footnotes
EXECUTIVE ACTION was forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, moved up closer still in hand late on the turn,
swept by at the head of the lane and finished going away while ridden out. AMERICAIN JOEY was away in good order and tracked the leader around the
first turn, stalked two wide up the backstretch, saved ground around the final turn, tipped two wide for the drive, responded under a drive and finished clearly
second best. DILLON ROCKS sped to the lead soon after the start and set the pace, continued to lead the way into the final turn, got collared by the winner
in upper stretch and weakened to show. MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE was reserved and raced well off the early pace, swung five wide into stretch and failed
to threaten. THREE FOR THREE raced in range sitting off the top trio up the backstretch, weakened around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive.
ONE TIME GEM trailed in the back throughout.
