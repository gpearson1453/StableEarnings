Footnotes
BASEQ AND BAKE set a well handled pace, drew off into the turn then was in a strong drive and just lasted in the end. AA TAKE A CHANCE chased the
early pace while three wide on the turn, was staying out three wide for the stretch drive and was gaining ground and finished well. TM PURNCESS chased
the early pace while inside, made a bid but came up empty in late stretch. WMA SMOKE SIGNAL lunged at the start then was settled, rallied on the inside
on the turn and stretch and was gaining ground but was no menace. RB MAMA WINGATE showed brief speed then dropped back. SWEET IVORY AA was
unhurried early and outrun. Race was hand timed.
