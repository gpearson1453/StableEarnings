SHEZENTICING Five wide early, four wide into the lane and was done. EDDIES ROCKET Fractious in the gate, continued to be fractious with the starter

WINNING DRIVE Broke sluggishly, close up along the two path, took the rail into the lane, angled out, collared the leader in gear and drew off. DOUBLE
VISION Vied lead along the two path, cleared into the lane, was collared and finished well. VIBE SETTER Never far back along the two path, four wide into
the lane and made a late bid. RALLY SQUIRREL Five wide on the turn, was not a threat. TOWN JAK Four wide and tired. TENENCY Forced the issue
early, four wide into the turn and tired.
