Footnotes
WAR SONG vied for the early advantage, dueled throughout, drove clear late and finished well. TAPPIN FORA DANCE pressed the pace, raced outside
around the turn, came down the stretch wide, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. HONOR MY SPEED raced within contention,
steadied down the backside, lacked running room, angled out entering the stretch, found running room, moved back to the inside and made a mild bid. RED
N WILD raced evenly near the back in the beginning, improved position, but was no factor. TRAELEE lacked early speed and passed tired ones. SLITHER
dueled on the front end, came out entering the home stretch and faded down the lane. HONORARIAN was fairly close in the early part, dropped back and
was no threat late.

win. MICHAEL'S MOON pressed the pace, raced close throughout and finished willingly. RITE ON SAM lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn,
gained ground and was a clear third at the wire. SWAMP POP sprinted to the front, drove clear, while being reserved and tired down the lane. MAJESTIC
PALACE lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn and was outrun.

MARDI GRAS MAMBO went to the front, came in around the turn, drove clear and won under urging. NOVA'S RETURN pressed the pace, forwardly placed
throughout, while racing outside around the turn, couldn't catch the winner, but held on for second. HALFMINEANDALLHERS quickly moved up, pressed
the pace on the inside, checked around the turn, getting in tight quarters, made a late rail bid and finished willingly. BEACH TRIPPIN brushed at the start,
lacked early speed, gained ground late, but was no factor. SOPHIE'S PAINTER raced near the back in the beginning, moved up to the middle of the field
and finished evenly on the inside. DADDY'S GIFT raced within contention, came around the turn on the outside and faded. MONEY KINGDOM always
raced near the back, finished wide and was no threat. COATTAILS broke sharp, dropped back, saved ground around the turn and was no threat late.
MAXIMUM GRACE brushed at the start, raced in the middle of the pack in the early going, came around the turn on the outside and retreated. A
STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE AND ALSO THE JOCKEY OF #1 HALFMINEANDALLHERS LODGED A
CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #9 MARDI GRAS MAMBO FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE TURN. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS
DISQUALIFED #9 FROM FIRST AND PLACED HIM THIRD.

Footnotes
FRONT AND SILVER raced within striking distance, moved up on the inside around the turn, angled out at the head of the stretch and was going away at
the end under steady urging. SARAH'S COURT pressed the pace, raced close throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second.
SABERFIGHT raced within contention, came around the turn four wide, made a bid, took the lead, but couldn't match strides with the top two. COME WHAT
MAE lacked early speed, made a steady gain, but was no real factor. BLESS D'SOUTH raced near the back in the beginning, showed late interest, finished
wide, but was no threat. MOR KISSES raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn on the outside, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. A P
HUMOR raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. HOT GOLDEN GIRL pressed the pace and made a steady retreat. IMMA MADI TUE broke a
step slow, quickly rushed to the front, drove clear and was done. ZEEROCK always raced near the back and showed little.
