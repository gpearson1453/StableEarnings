Footnotes
FASTER just off pace, dueled to the half three wide, kept on, held sway. ROYAL COURT raced back to the hal, kicked in stretch closing the gap too late.
COAL BOSS saved ground while back to far turnrallied in earnest for show. UNUSUAL ACTIVITY bit awkward start, no speed to far turn, improved position
late. SOUTHERN BREEZE pressed and dueled to the half took a stutter step far turn faded. KOHAKU four wide into first turn tried to keep up with no late
response. SHOTGUN PRO never a menace throughout. BACKSTRETCH inside speed to the front first turn, dueled at the half, empty.
