Footnotes
SUPA SPEED chased three deep then outside a rival, took aim two wide into the lane, put to right handed urging, latched onto the runner-up midstretch and
drew clear under strong handling. SOPHISTRY reluctant to load into the gate, was off alertly and cleared from outside, moved over to the inside, showed
the way clear to the eighth pole, challenged by SUPA SPEED midstretch and yielded late. MY PERFECT WAVE was off slow to begin, traveled three deep
at the back then off the rail, rounded the bend in the two path, steered out in the lane and rallied to get up for third. MADONNA OF LORETO coaxed along
in pursuit early, took the turn two wide, lacked a bid in the furlong grounds and got nailed for the show honors. NAPLES GAL chased from inside, ridden
along into the stretch and weakened. PLAYSCAPE raced in the second flight, saved ground on the rail then tipped two wide past the quarter pole and
lacked further response. HOW ABOUT PAVEL reluctant in the loading process, traveled in range between runners then in the two path, shifted in then back
out early on the turn and faded out of contention. DADDYGAVEITTOME broke a step slow, raced outside a rival at the back, trailed into the turn, took the
turn two wide then moved over to the rail around the bend and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BRIGHT LEAF unhurried from outside and remained wide through the first turn, drew closer four deep on the backstretch, chased four to five wide on the
second bend, reached the front at the eighth pole, quickly cleared under a drive and won going away under steady handling. LEYAS CANDY rated three
then two wide early, moved into striking distance in the middle stages, bid two wide at the five-sixteenths pole, cleared into the stretch, overtaken by the
winner at the eighth pole, could not fight back in the furlong grounds but stayed on to hold second. LOW EXPECTATIONS settled early along the rail, asked
right handed approaching the quarter pole and tipped out, offered a mild response and gained third. IT'S MY HOUSE stepped to the front opened up a
comfortable lead in the two path around the clubhouse turn, held a diminished lead into the far turn, confronted by outer rival at the five-sixteenths pole,
fought back to the quarter pole, the lost command and chased the new leader into the stretch and weakened. AMERICAN FARMER sat off the pace in the
two path, chased between foes in the middle stages, ridden along into the far turn, moved out and entered the lane three to four wide and weakened.
MOBOU settled three wide off the pace, drew closer three deep and between on the backstretch, got crowded a bit at the five-sixteenths pole and tired.

Footnotes
ONE ARROW broke well and led early from outside, ceded command around the first turn, regained the lead at the nine-sixteenths pole, dueled up the
backstretch, cleared into the far turn, opened up around the bend, continued clear under urging into the deep stretch and held safely. GIRLCANTHELPIT off
slow to begin, trailed from inside then moved off the rail, passed rivals in the middle stages, made progress, weaving through traffic on the far turn, came
with a late run but could not reach the winner. I'M STILL IN IT bothered by outer rival at the start, chased four wide into the first turn then moved closer while
shifting in a few paths around that bend, ridden along two then three wide on the far turn, lacked the needed response in the lane but churned on for a clear
third. HIGH FLYING GRACIE chased five then six wide on the first turn, went up to challenge for command early on the backstretch and dueled from
outside, failed to keep up with the winner into the far turn, weakened around the bend and faded in the drive. ROUND IN CIRCLES got bumped, put in tight
and checked into the first turn, settled inside off the pace, angled out on the far turn and entered the lane six wide, then kept on to improve position.
LOOKATHERGLIDE chased four then five wide early, asked three wide on the far turn and came up empty. STORMING GRAY climbed six then five wide
on the first turn, went three deep into the second bend, came six wide into the stretch and was never a factor. CY'S SILKSTOCKING bumped with inner rival
into the first turn, chased off the rail then moved inward around the clubhouse turn, went up to take the lead early on the backstretch but was overtaken
shortly after, chased the top pair into the far turn, tired around the bend, eased in the lane and walked off. SMOOTH AS BUTTER raced up close then
cleared around the clubhouse turn, lost command early on the backstretch and gave chase to the far turn, tired around the second bend, eased in the lane
and walked off. SENT BY ANGELS broke in a bit to bother a rival then chased off the inside, fell back in the middle stages, trailed on the far turn, eased and
walked off.

Footnotes
BIG SUMMER tracked from outside, went three deep into the turn, eased out and took aim five wide into the stretch, took over midstretch and held over
inner rivals late. JUST NAILS brushed early then chased outside a rival, waited behind the leaders two wide on the turn, bid between in deep stretch and
could not get by. HEADED FOR OM chased along the rail, tipped out at the top of the lane then altered back inside, challenged from the fence but lacked
the needed late punch. EXCELIA (IRE) raced up close early, waited for room behind the leaders while saving ground around the bend, gained an opening
approaching the stretch, burst through to take the lead, lost command midstretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. GEM MINE pressed three deep early,
vied outside inner pair through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, dug in to the eighth pole then weakened. MAKE IT SNOW hopped a bit at the start,
trailed early under coaxing, went two wide into the turn, swung out and came five wide into the lane, kept trying through the stretch but needed to find more.
UFFDA dueled from inside then vied inside pair around the bend, came off the rail leaving the turn and folded once overtaken. GIRL OF MY DREAMS
dueled outside UFFDA up the backstretch, fought between rivals around the bend then three wide into the lane and retreated.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE CAMIE stalked up the backstretch, challenged the top pair from the rail on the turn, dueled with JUST IS into the lane, put that rival away in
upper stretch and drew away under hand urging. SLAM DIEGO traveled near the back two wide into the turn, split rivals near the five-sixteenths pole,
chased within range three to four wide entering the stretch, finished willingly to gain second but was no match for the winner. JUST IS chased briefly then
went up to press from outside, vied three deep then dueled outside CHAMPAGNE CAMIE CAMMIE on the turn, yielded to that rival in upper stretch and
flattened to third. RYDER'S CANDY laid off the pace in the early going, made some progress five deep around the bend but could not rally when needed in
the final furlong. ACT OF SERENDIPITY lacked early speed, trailed to the turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved position while drifting inward.
SOLID TUNE chase two wide into the turn, got blocked behind a rival and steadied a quarter mile out, moved inside but could not regain momentum.
SMART KITTEN raced in range between rivals, lost ground three then four wide on the turn and faded. DEFICIT MAJA sat off the pace and moved inside,
had to pause and altered out at the quarter pole, chased three wide into the lane and failed to menace. SOUL OF A WARRIOR chased from outside, got
crowded four deep between rivals on the turn, exited the bend six wide and had little left for the drive. SING A HAPPY SONG grabbed the lead then set a
pressured pace up the backstretch, yielded between rivals and weakened on the turn, then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
PIONEER PRINCE chased briefly from inside leaving the chute then took over first time through the stretch, remained unchallenged up the backstretch and
far turn, drew away into the stretch and held safely under left handed encouragement and steady handling. BALDORO stalked two wide then moved to the
rail into the first turn, traveled in mid-pack in the middle stages, angled three wide leaving the far turn, closed well but had to settle for second best. TRIBAL
away quickly and showed the way leaving the chute, took a stalking position in the two path, continued two wide through the far turn and finished evenly in
the final furlong. BEAR HUNT moved to the inside racing near the back, asked along the fence on the far turn, moved out in the lane and improved position.
WHAT A DUDE stalked from inside, roused on the far turn, asked right handed into the lane and weakened. MIGHTY KAI got crowded between rivals
shortly after the start, settled at the back on the inside, trailed through the far turn, came out in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. PINEHURST (IRE)
showed early speed four deep then was taken in hand, traveled three then two wide around the clubhouse turn, continued two wide on the second bend and
lacked a response when called upon. BRONKO NAGURSKI also had early speed between rivals then ceded command, tracked three then two wide around
the first turn, asked three wide on the second bend and faded. VORPAL unhurried and moved inward in the opening stages, traveled outside a rival near the
back, came three wide into the stretch and never got involved.

Footnotes
LORETTA LYNN stalked from the two path, moved closer between on the backstretch, bid inside the leader still in the two path at the quarter pole, took over
approaching the stretch, cleared a furlong out and held safely under urging. NANCI GRIFFITH raced up close four wide around the first turn, dropped back
off the pace in the middle stages, trailed past the seven-sixteenths pole, angled out and came five wide into the stretch, produced a mild late bid but could
not reach the winner. DENDERA moved right before the start then hopped when the gates opened, moved to the inside trailing early, passed a rival entering
the far turn, driven two wide into the lane and got up for third. SMILING LADY dueled inside a rival into the first turn then cleared around the bend, drifted
out a bit on the far turn, lost command nearing the stretch and flattened to fourth. BLAZING BARDOT stalked from the rail position, asked around the far
turn, cut the corner into the lane, chased within striking distance with a furlong remaining, then weakened. STELLAR CAP dueled from outside briefly then
took a stalking position around the first turn, traveled three deep on the backstretch, continued off the rail to the lane and weakened.
ILLHAVEANOTHERKISS tracked five wide around the clubhouse turn, rounded the second bend three then four wide and tired.

chased two wide into the far turn, ran into traffic and altered out around a trio of rivals at the quarter pole, bid four deep at the eighth pole but got outkicked
by the winner in deep stretch. FLINT STROLL unhurried in the opening stages and took the first turn three then two wide, drew closer four deep on the far
turn and challenged at the quarter pole, fought three wide into the stretch, inched ahead then yielded in midstretch and saved the show. RED CROSS
KNIGHT dueled from outside to the far turn, inched ahead briefly past the five-sixteenths pole, confronted by FLINT STROLL at the quarter pole, fought in
the two path entering the lane, lost command in upper stretch and faltered in the final sixteenth. AURELIAN MAN moved inside racing near the back,
chased inside a pair of rivals into the far turn, was on the move from the fence then got blocked behind a weakening rival and shuffled back, tipped out into
the clear and finished out well. TIZ TOK settled on the inside, went two wide into the far turn and lacked a response when called upon. CLOONEY laid off
the pace, traveled in the two path, checked when running up on a rival approaching the quarter pole, driven three wide into the lane and failed to menace.
HAPI HAPI trailed from inside early, moved out on the backstretch and went four deep into the far turn, chased widest into the lane and proved no menace.
UPSTART YANKEE tracked outside a rival, put in a mild bid three wide on the far turn, chased two to three wide into the lane and faded. NAUVOO dueled
