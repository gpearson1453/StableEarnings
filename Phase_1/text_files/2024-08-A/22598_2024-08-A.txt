Footnotes
STREET WARRIOR saved ground around the first turn, led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way up the backstretch and drew off in the
lane, much the best. SUPERSTAR SWANK saved ground early, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, swung out to
the four path coming around the second turn and chased the winner home from there, no match for that rival. VICTORIOUS VANDA raced off the pace in
the two path through the opening half mile, came around the far bend in the four path and made up some ground in the lane while proving to be no match
for the winner. GENERAL BATTLE AXE raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around
the far turn still in the two path and faded in the stretch. FROSTY VIEW saved ground early, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued
to save ground around the second turn and tired from there. HIGH RANSOM raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch,
navigated the far bend from the two path and was not a factor.

HURTS SO GOOD dueled on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and battled back gamely in the stretch to just get up for
the win. LUCKY SMILE dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and dug in gamely to the wire to
just miss. SAINT CHARLES chased the leader on the outside early, saved ground around the bend and improved position in the stretch. DIRECT ACTION
raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend, began a bid entering the stretch and gained ground late.
BLUESKIESANDANGELS was away from the gate slowly, trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and never threatened.
SAMURAI MIKE raced in the middle of the pack through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the three path and was outkicked in the stretch.
BOSS NINE raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and made no bid.
