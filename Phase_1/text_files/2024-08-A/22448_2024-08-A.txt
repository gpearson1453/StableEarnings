drew off in the lane. BIG PETE hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the three path early, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around
the second turn in the two path and chased on to the finish, no match for the winner. FRANZ raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field up
the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the far turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position in the lane while proving
to be no match for the winner. GRUNDER saved ground early, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the
second bend and weakened in the lane. SWAMPDRAINER raced off the pace in the three path through the opening half mile, came around the far bend in
the two and three path and made no bid. O DOGG raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the three path and was outkicked in the lane. INFINITE MORO raced in the four path early, stalked the leader on

Footnotes
WYNN TRIP raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained
ground late to get up for the win at the wire. HAPPY HOUR BOBBY led the way up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the two path and dueled
gamely to the wire to narrowly miss. PASSION OF JOE'S stalked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the three
path and chased on to the finish. I WISH I COULD tracked the leader between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and kept on
from there. HANGIN' TUFF raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path and never threatened.
SCHLEICHER trailed the field through the opening stages, swung out to the four path coming around the bend and showed no kick. CINCO EL
SOVEREIGN raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and made no bid. J J'S WILDCAT chased the leader on
the inside through the early going, saved ground around the bend and tired in the stretch.
