Footnotes
CHIPOTLE a bit reluctant to load, broke well from the outside, angled in soon after floating BOBBY ROCKY JAKE into RAMIEL, showed the way into the
turn, continued to set the pace while in hand through the bend, opened up when straightened for home and held a comfortable advantage to the wire under
steady handling. RAMIEL steadied briefly just after the start as BOBBY ROCKY JAKE was carried in by the winner, recovered and moved up to race closest
to the latter into and through the turn, fell back off that same foe in upper stretch despite being called on for run, chased to the wire, clearly second best.
WHIZBANG raced back off the pace and the inside, was roused while between rivals turning for home, displayed some mild late interest to finish up best of
the rest, no threat to the winner. BOBBY ROCKY JAKE floated in by the winner just after the start, settled in the second flight while four wide and between
horses into the turn, continued four wide, lacked a significant closing response to miss the show. PERCY fell back to trail after the start, continued to see
them all through the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided while never a serious threat. LET'S HAVE A PARTY broke with
the field, main body while inside, continued to save ground through the turn, had nothing for the drive. PETRIFIED last away, was used a bit to move up on
the outside, five wide into the turn, stopped, jogged in far back. FOLLOWING OBJECTIONS BY THE RIDERS OF BOTH RAMIEL AND BOBBY ROCKY
JAKE AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE JUST AFTER THE START, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SAINT MARCO asked after the start to maintain inside position, dueled through the first turn and up the backstretch, headed by the other speed far turn,
responded when put to pressure. headed by the winner with a quarter to run, dueled with that one the length of the stretch and proved stubborn to the end
while being herded in a bit. GAMBLING TZAR allowed the dueling leaders to go early, stalked that pair onto and up the backstretch off the inside, advanced
on that pair three wide in the second turn, hooked up with the runner up for an extended stretch duel exiting the final bend, proved narrowly best while
drifting in steadily and under brisk handling from a right handed crop. ENTRUST dueled up front off the inside, put a head in front early the far turn, vied
through that bend then fell from between the top two entering the stretch, could not get back to the that pair in the run to the wire.

Footnotes
MY CHARM forwardly placed from the start, vied through the turn on the outside and three keep, kicked well clear through upper stretch and was not
threatened the final furlong while kept to pressure. NOHAI broke awkwardly, trailed well back early as a result while out in the strip, five wide through the
turn, rallied willingly to be a clear second while not a threat to the winner. IT'S ALL RED close up early while just inside the winner, moved to the fore with
that one entering the turn, vied between horses through much the bend, could not keep up with the winner through the stretch nor contain the runner up.
HEARTS FANTASY fell back off the first flight along the inside after a furlong, moved out, raced for to five wide through the turn, went evenly in the drive.
VIVY contested the pace four a half while closest to the inside through the turn, weakened. EXPECT LOVE flashed some brief early foot along the inside,
stopped through the lane and jogged in.

Footnotes
MAJESTY'S FREEDOM in the second flight while racing outside, continued three wide through the turn, roused for the drive, kept coming while well out in
the strip to gain the nod in the final stride. CATALINA CRUZIN also in the second group while between horses and inside the winner, set down with that foe
for the stretch drive, late bid while once again between horses, narrowly missed. DANCING BEAUTY pressed the early leader from the outside, took over
late in the turn, came in the three path for the drive, continued to show the way past the furlong marker while inside the top two, gave ground grudgingly to
that pair while drifting out a bit late. BYTHENUMBERS void of early foot, three path into the lane, set down for the drive, angled inside of a drifting leader
inside the furlong grounds in showing some belated interest. SHAYMYNAME in the second group while inside the top two and closest to the rail, weakened
after a half. PINK SUNSET off a step slow, remained back in failing to menace. SHORT OF DINERO hustled away from the rail along the inside to make the
early advantage, set a pressured pace for just over three furlongs then gave way when headed midway on the turn.

Footnotes
WISE MISS settled in the second flight early while toward the inside, angled out late turn, came four wide for the drive, outside bid, kicked quickly and
strongly clear under right handed urging. CITY MINUTE in tight at the start, off the pace while inside, crept a bit closer late in the turn along the rail, cut the
corner into the stretch to be closest to the winner when straightened for home, proved no match for that one the final furlong, saved the place while
continuing inside. MAXS PICK within striking distance while outside, continued well out in the strip into the lane, slowly getting to the runner up late, no
threat to the winner. FUL OF SHENANIGANS sprinted clear early, continued to hold a daylight advantage early in the turn, gradually weakened when
headed by the winner into the stretch. WAMPY settled off the pace while racing toward the inside up the backstretch, moved off the inside through the turn
and then went evenly through the stretch. JUST MARYANN lacked early foot, failed to muster a rally while remaining back while off the inside. LA BELLA
BOROBETA broke in putting the runner up in tight, fell back to trail and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD floated out early, took over soon after the start off the inside, clear and in hand in the three path late in the bend, drew off through
the lane under token encouragement to win ridden out. BLESSED TOUCH slow to start in trailing early, moved closer up the inside, got out, four wide into
the lane, no match for the winner, saved the place. SPIN THE BREEZE lacked early foot, continued back while saving ground into the lane, staged a mild
rally up the rail to annex the show. KITTY'S PRETTY within striking distance while in hand and off the inside for a half, came up empty the final furlong,
outkicked for the third spot. MUSICAL DESIGN broke well, relinquished the early advantage to the winner while getting out a bit, chased that same foe for a
half then steadily weakened through the lane to lose a couple of positions. EXTREMELY GRUNTLED lacked speed while off the inside, roused in the two
path, failed to mount a response. ONLY KIDDING fell back to trail after the start and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA SOBER broke slow and raced off the pace and off the rail around the first turn, methodically inched into range leaving the three eights marker,
engaged the leader from the outside leaving the quarter pole, wore down that rival passing the furlong marker, and stayed clear under a steady drive.
ROMANTIC LEAD set the pace from the rail around the first turn, under token pressure down the backside took the leading roll into the far turn, collard in
upper stretch, fought on inside that rival, no match late. HAIZUM tracked inside around the first turn, saved ground into far turn, put to task leaving the three
eighths pole, unable to match strides with the top pair, through the stretch. ST PETE'S PASSION saved ground around the first turn, inside and unhurried
down the back side, started his bid leaving the quarter pole, eased out four wide in upper stretch, showed interest late. BIG ANDY MORT was slow away
from the gate, off the pace and towards the rear, never threatened through the lane. HONOR THE CROSS stalked the pace setter from the two path around
the first turn and down the backside, chased the leader around the second bend, weakened while making a bid between runners leaving the quarter pole.
AFT tracked the pace from the four path around the first turn, settled in four wide tracking position down the backside, bid three wide leaving the three
eighths marker, gave way from the quarter pole.
