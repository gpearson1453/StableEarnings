Footnotes
CLASS WIZARD , urged soon after the start, advanced outside FLASH IS BACK to gain a short lead near the half mile pole, maintained the lead and dug in
late to prevail. GO TAKE CHARGE lacked speed, worked between horses in upper stretch, eased outside approaching the sixteenth pole and closed.
SILVERBULLETTWENTY hugged the inner rail around both turns and down the backstretch, eased off the rail in upper stretch and came up empty. FLASH
IS BACK showed speed along the inner rail and faded late. SUPER E lacked speed, stayed along the inner rail throughout and passed a pair of tired horses
late. GOOD KNIGHT NILE , three wide the first turn, was four wide leaving the far turn and failed to be a factor. PRINCE OF PORTLAND raced in the three
path on both turns and gave way.

Footnotes
MINIME , forwardly placed while saving ground, responded to coaxing and took closer order past the five sixteenths, took advantage of an opening along
rail and moved up to engage the dueling leaders past the three sixteenths, forged clear under a drive with a sixteenth to go and held firm. LANCE'S SMILE
advanced to the inside of KISS ME MORE and took command after a furlong, spurted clear and set the pace towards the inner rail, wandered outward a bit
soon into the lane, corrected and fought on between rivals nearing mid stretch then kept on gamely from there to be well clear of the rest. STORMY IRISH
LASS broke on top then stumbled, recovered and prompted the pace three wide outside a rival, was under pressure four wide into the stretch, remained on
her left lead to about the sixteenth pole, switched over then churned on to get the show over a fading rival. SWEET HONEY BEE , taken to rate four wide
outside rivals, ranged up outside foes to loom into the lane, gained a slim lead battling outside the top pair nearing mid stretch, failed to sustain and
weakened late. KISS ME MORE had speed to lead early, was headed from her inside after an eighth of a mile but stayed on to track two wide, failed to
quicken with the leaders past the five sixteenths, shifted out four to five wide and fade. LUCKY HONEY drafted back off the pace, raced two to three wide
and lacked a bid. TIA MAYIN dropped back early.

Footnotes
ZIHUATANEJO saved ground around the first turn, eased off the rail near the three eighths pole, chased the leader, got up at the wire, returned in apparent
distress from the heat but walked off after being hosed down. IKE'S GAMBLE sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and gave way grudgingly.
PIETRELCINA , steadied when shuffled back entering the first turn, circled the far turn four wide and rallied. NO FOOLIN MO , three wide the first turn,
raced in the three path between horses the far turn and passed tired horses. SASSE'S CLASS hugged the inner rail, was briefly steadied in close quarters
at the head of the stretch and failed to be a menace. OWHATANITE raced well off the inner rail, was caught in traffic leaving the far turn and failed to rally.
VALORE stalked the pace racing along the inner rail and gave way through the stretch. DOMINGUEZ chased the pace, faltered and was eased.

WISH ME HOME broke sharply, drifted out a touch heading to the first while vying outside MAGICAL MONARCH, shook clear soon into the backstretch
then dropped in and set a rated pace, moved away from his closest pursuer entering the lane, opened up under left handed asking in mid stretch then was
fully extended to hold off outside threats. EL DE LARRY , forwardly placed two wide and between rivals near the half, eased out a bit around the final turn,
moved up three wide and to the inside of a rival into the stretch, closed in steadily through the final furlong and got second between foes. AMERICAN
UNITY settled off the pace while between horses early, angled out while put to a ride around the final turn, circled four wide into the stretch, closed outside
rivals in deep stretch then hung through the final strides. STELLAR LUTE saved ground under early rating, steadied lightly off of a retreating rival near the
three eighths, angled out to pursue into the stretch, shifted back in for the final furlong and rallied. TOM HAGEN , floated out a path by the winner nearing
the first turn, straightened and stalked that one into the far turn, was under heavy pressure pursuing into the stretch, lacked a punch past the three
sixteenths and weakened. MICROPHONE (IRE) broke a bit slow, edged up then was carried out to the four path into the first turn, settled three wide stalking
past the five eighths, was under a ride chasing leaving the far turn, failed to go on in upper stretch and weakened. LUIGI'S SPIRIT , three wide outside foes
into the backstretch, failed to respond. MAGICAL MONARCH vied inside the winner to early backstretch, faltered leaving the far turn and was eased late.

PEACHYNESS accelerated to the early lead, hugged the rail throughout, went clear turning for home then eagerly increased her advantage while under
energetic urging in the stretch. ANOTHERHOPE chased the pace while between horses around the turn, entered the stretch in the two path, moved to the
inner rail near the eighth pole and got up for the place. GO ROUND broke slowly, kept near the rail on the turn, eased off the fence at the head of the lane,
was blocked in upper stretch, altered course to the five path in mid stretch and rallied late. RESPECT THE LAW swung to the four path turning for home and
flattened out. FEROCIOUSNESS , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened. HONESTLY remained along the inner rail around the turn,
chased the pace and faltered in upper stretch. MISTY SUNDAY prompted the pace outside the winner and faltered the final furlong.

Footnotes
SWILL , under a snug hold stalking four wide outside rivals, responded when shaken up leaving the quarter pole, closed in under strong right handed asks,
forged to command a sixteenth out then drew clear. TIDEWATER settled off the pace and off the inside, shifted out to be about five wide in upper stretch,
finished with good energy outside foes and nabbed the place in the final jumps. BARZINI , steadied along between foes while stalking the pace into the turn,
remained between foes chasing past mid stretch, kept on with effort but was edged for second. FUN NOTION sped to the front, set a rated pace towards the
inside, turned away an initial outside threat nearing the stretch, spurted back clear off the inside under a drive leaving the quarter pole, clung to the
advantage to about the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. HAD TO HAVE HIM rated off the pace while saving ground, cut the corner into the lane,
edged up near mid stretch, eased out then steadied briefly a sixteenth out then kept on with interest once clear. MATTA prompted the pace while saving
ground, had aim towards the inner rail nearing mid stretch but failed to seriously kick on. ODINSON , away alertly, tracked from the outside, bid to threaten
past the three eighths, gave futile chase leaving mid stretch and faded. SUPREME LAW broke a step slow, then steadied soon after, circled five wide into
the lane but could only muster up a slight kick.

ARTISTIC REASON stayed along the inner rail stalking the pace for five furlongs, eased out to the three path at the head of the stretch, swept to command
in mid stretch then drew away under urging. MOSE PERFECT prompted the pace outside KERNESS, overtook that one at the top of the lane, drifted out in
mid stretch and faded in the drive. KERNESS showed speed along the inner rail for six furlongs then gradually weakened through the stretch. ALIFEROUS
in range in the two path around the turn, eased out approaching the stretch, was fanned five wide near the quarter pole then retreated through the lane. PIT
BOSS chased the pace in the three path for five furlongs then faltered turning for home.

TWO BY TWO lagged off the inside, was put to a stout ride outside a rival leaving the far turn, swung out seven wide with momentum into the stretch,
continued relentlessly despite switching leads a couple of times and got up at the wire. SWITZER , taken well in hand early, drafted back some leaving the
five eighths, advanced four wide between foes into the lane, closed in and overtook the leader from the outside near the sixteenth pole, kept on gamely but
was edged at the wire. PRINCE KHOZAN settled off the pace and off the inside, worked his way between rivals past the five sixteenths and in mid stretch,
edged up behind the top pair past the sixteenth pole, altered out late and kept on with good energy. MAJESTIC EAGLE , three deep to contention, edged up
to be the closest pursuer around the far turn, gained under a hustling ride into the lane, spurted clear in mid stretch then faded late. STAR SHOPPING , in a
bit close at the break, was unhurried early while saving some ground, awaited room past the five sixteenths, shifted out past the three sixteenths and
churned on. MONSTER MASON , three wide early under rating, gained five wide outside foes into the lane, chased between rivals past mid stretch then
flattened out. SHOFAR saved ground, eased out and was under coaxing around the final turn, steadied briefly with some traffic in mid stretch but failed to
seriously kick on. U S CONSTITUTION saved ground early, angled out leaving the five eighths, gave futile chase leaving the three eighths and weakened.
FORMAL ORDER dropped in and lagged back early, angled four wide for the drive and offered a mild response. GRADED ON A CURVE saved ground off
the pace, edged up past the three sixteenths, checked when blocked soon after, shifted out and had some late interest. GUAPONESS sped clear early, set
the pace towards the rail, failed to resist MAJESTIC EAGLE past the three sixteenths and weakened. POWER BACK , between foes early, chased and
faltered.

NO EASY DAYS prompted the early pace outside REAL TALK, engaged that one mid way on the turn, dueled through the stretch and prevailed in an
extended drive. REAL TALK broke alertly to make the early lead, saved ground around the turn, battled inside the winner through the lane and just missed
in a sharp effort. CATAHOULA MOON saved ground around the turn in a forward position, remained along the rail through the stretch and rallied. TAKE A
HINT , four deep on the turn, was well positioned entering the stretch and weakened. COFFEEWITHCHRIS raced in the two path on the turn and failed to
be a factor. JOHN THE BEAR , three wide chasing the early pace, weakened. THE KHOZAN ONE stayed along the inner rail on the turn while outrun.
TAKE CHARGE TOO broke slowly, steadied on the heels of a rival leaving the backstretch, swung wide in upper stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
BIG WANDA steadied back from between rivals soon after the break, saved ground under some coaxing into the turn, angled out and circled four wide
under a hustling ride into the stretch, altered out to about the six path near mid stretch, shifted inward as the leader drifted out, closed stoutly under
pressure, forged to command inside the sixteenth marker and eagerly kicked away. ARIEL MOON had speed to the inside of a rival then rated back into the
turn, angled out and rebid in hand into the lane, went clear without asking leaving the three sixteenths, came under a ride past the furlong grounds,
wandered outward and continued willingly to be second best. INTEL AGENT stalked inside under some rating, angled three wide and took aim past the
quarter pole, dropped back inside but lacked a serious punch through the final seventy yards. GINGERSRACEDAY drafted back off the pace, raced two to
three wide in upper stretch and offered a slight response. AMELIA'S JOY saved ground mid turn, was under urging into the lane, briefly steadied off of a
tiring foe in mid stretch, angled out but lacked a solid finish. ANXIOUS HEART chased outside a rival, came four wide for the drive and faded. HEAVENLY
CIELLA vied outside ARIEL MOON then cleared heading to the turn, set the pace towards the inner rail, was collared soon into the lane then weakened a
furlong out.
