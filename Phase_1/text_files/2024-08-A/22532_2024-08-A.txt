CLASSY'N CONNECTED saved ground, bid at the quarter pole and drew off under a mild urging. PARADISE LANE was clear early but couldn't hold off the
winner. NOTA BELLE stalked the pace between rivals and gave way in the stretch. RYBAKINA was unrushed early, circled six wide commencing at the
three-eighths pole but couldn't close late. LIL'S COFFEE bobbled the start, stalked the pace between rivals, bid inside early in the stretch but faltered.
SOUNDBITE stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the three-eighths pole and gave way in the stretch. ANOINTED OF GOD stalked between rivals to
the backstretch and gave way. QUEEN OF PARIS bobbled the start, bid in the four path at the five-eighths pole but faded in the stretch. DANCING
PRINCESS was fractious in the gate and hopped at the start, then saved ground to no avail. PHRASE was not a factor.
