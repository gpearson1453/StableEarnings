Footnotes
TIZ PURPLE moved in while going to the front then showed the way, vied in the two path while inside of WILL NOT BE SWAYED on the turn, was asked at
the five-sixteenths pole, turned into upper stretch on even terms with the aforementioned rival, battled determinedly under a right-handed crop into the final
furlong, fought under the crop until just before the sixteenth-pole, disposed of the runner-up at that juncture while placed under a strong hand-ride and
gamely prevailed. WILL NOT BE SWAYED leaned out and hit the gate while last to commence, moved up on the outside under urging, made a bid late on
the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the four path while on even terms for the lead, battled outside the winner until
near the sixteenth-pole then was turned away and outfinished while well clear for the place. MEZCALIFORNIA brushed the inside of the gate, was taken in
hand while brushing with a foe early then climbed into kickback at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail into upper stretch and improved for
the show. GERLIN'S EMPIRE brushed with a foe early then steadied briefly, steadied again near the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path,
came out to the four path into upper stretch, drifted out some under a left-handed crop around the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. BOSSY
DISH showed speed then dropped just off the pace, chased inside on the turn and tired. NOT TOO LATE broke in then was quickly corrected, raced on the
outside under urging, went around the turn in the five path, drifted in late and came up empty. ROYAL PRINCESS was taken in hand when the pacesetter
crossed in front early then chased just off the pace, shifted from the two path to the four path early on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
OWN THE FIELD shied out at the start under coaxing filling the space left vacant by MASTER OF ARMS, chased just off the inside before briefly tucking
inside into the turn, tipped back to the two path midway and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command inside the eighth pole and was brushed near the sixteenth marker while inching away to the finish to prevail. DILLINGER got bumped at the start
by MASTER OF ARMS, prompted the pace of that rival from the outside four then three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide
into upper stretch and took over command straightened away, dug in under threat and was collared inside the eighth pole, came out under a left handed
crop and brushed his main rival a sixteenth out, ran on to preserve the place honors clear of the rest. PARKWAY got bumped at the start by RIDER'S
SPECIAL, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to the
finish. MASTER OF ARMS broke out at the start bumping DILLINGER, came under coaxing and cut the pace just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. MR. PAPAGIORGIO six paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch,
tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. RIDER'S
SPECIAL a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, broke out at the start bumping PARKWAY, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing half a mile from home, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. PRINCIPE D'ORO
bobbled at the break, chased four then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CLASSIC LEGACY dropped from the three path to the two path on the first turn, settled nicely off the pace, moved closer while two then three wide on the
far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch then took over near the three-sixteenths, kicked clear under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, remained clear
under a solid hand-ride into the final sixteenth then was placed under lighter encouragement and proved much the best while waiting on competition with his
ears pricked to the finish. FROMANOTHAMUTHA rounded the first turn in the two to three path, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid late on the
backstretch, vied in the two to three path on the turn, took a short lead near the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage to the winner while under a drive in
upper stretch and proved no match but earned the place. PIRATE brushed with a rival after the start then dropped back, traveled around the opening bend
in the two path, settled at the rear, was roused while shifting from the three path to the five path on the far turn, moved closer in the process, turned into
upper stretch under a drive, pursued the winner into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. SEEKING UNITY broke out
then hit the gate and was off slow, went four wide on the first turn, moved up entering the backstretch then settled just off the pace on the outside, stalked in
the three then four path on the final turn, was given his cue near the five-sixteenths pole and came up empty. VICTORS VALIANT bumped with a rival just
after the start, raced inside on the first turn, showed the way through solid fractions, vied inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked while losing the
lead near the five-sixteenths pole, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. ABADIN bumped with a rival just after the start while brushing with another foe,
saved ground on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, came under coaxing near the nine-sixteenths, chased inside on the far turn and capitulated.

command just outside the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive to prevail. AARAJ coaxed from the gate, vied inside among a trio, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in and ran on to secure the place honors. UNCLECHARLIESGIFT chased four then three
wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. ON THE LEDGE broke out at the
start bumping ROYAL KING in tandem with MUAZARAH, vied two to three wide between foes coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued two to
three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole, kept on to preserve the show honors. ROYAL KING got
bumped between foes who each came his way and was forced to steady at the start conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased three to four wide
coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to kick on belatedly to the finish. PASCHAL

to the finish. XCELLENT MEN got bumped at the start by GIANT'S FIRE, chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, tipped six to seven wide

three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. MUAZARAH bobbled at the break and recovered inwards into ROYAL KING, chased three wide
and was forced to steady off the heels of NEUSCHWANSTEIN when that foe tucked in front five furlongs from home, tucked to the two path through the turn
coming under coaxing three furlongs out, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
STERLING SILVER brushed with a rival at the start, went around most of the first turn in the two path then dropped to the inside, was well placed just off the
pace, drafted behind foes while moving from the inside to the two path on the far turn, dropped back to the rail while asked after turning into the stretch,
made a bid at the three-sixteenths pole then took over, kicked clear under a strong hand-ride outside the furlong marker, remained under a solid hand-ride
until near the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. MAGGY'S PALACE raced in the four path for most of the first turn then dropped to the
three path, settled on the outside, gained to make a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive,
lost touch with the winner outside the furlong marker and proved no match while able to get the place. SMOKIN' HOT KITTY was hustled from the gate,
raced in the three path for most of the first turn then dropped to the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid late on the backstretch, took the
lead in the two path midway through the far turn, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and weakened. BUSTIN BAY broke out at the start, raced
in the five path for the majority of the opening bend then dropped to the four path, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged four wide on the far turn,
floated into the seven path entering the stretch and faltered. SUNSET LOUISE went to the front, showed the way on the inside, lost the lead midway through
the far turn then dropped back, moved to the three path outside the quarter-pole and stopped then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
RIVERWALK established the front and showed the way in hand two to three wide patiently handled until roused spinning two to three wide into upper
stretch, drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole, held well and clear to the finish geared down inside the final sixteenth. BEARINGS got bumped solidly
between foes and was squeezed back at the start conceding five lengths to the front, chased five to six paths off the inside early on until tucked four wide
into the far turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, closed well to secure the place honors well clear of the
rest and along second best. GUILE broke out at the start, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BOUNTEOUS chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened. CRUSADING broke in at the start bumping BEARINGS in tandem with FIRE BARON,
chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. SMOOTH AN EASY broke out at the
start carrying out FIRE BARON into BEARINGS and squeezing that foe back against pressure outside from CRUSADING, chased five paths off the inside
and then three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. PUJOL chased two to three wide
coming under coaxing at the half mile pole, went four wide through the far turn and then three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. FIRE
BARON broke out and then got bumped between foes at the start due to pressure from SMOOTH AND EASY inside and CRUSADING outside and was
pinched back in concert with BEARINGS conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased four to five paths off the inside early on and then two to three
wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.
