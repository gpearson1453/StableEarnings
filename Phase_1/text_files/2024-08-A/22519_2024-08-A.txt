DRAGOON GUARD made the early lead maintaining daylight under measured handling through the backside then the far turn responding when called upon
along the inside down the lane finding more there holding firm to wire. DIMATIC tracked the pace to the far turn hustling on the outside to upper stretch
vying willingly four wide from the eighth pole making no headway on the winner a game second best. SOCIETY MAN stalked the pace laying close through
the backside chasing on the far turn extending there weakening the final sixteenth. HENRO hustled out would stalk the pace chasing on the far turn
wavering into upper stretch fading in the three path. AGATE ROAD slow early trailed through the far turn failing to mount a bid down the stretch. MCQUEEN
gave a prompted middle move then weakened on the far turn folding into upper stretch.
