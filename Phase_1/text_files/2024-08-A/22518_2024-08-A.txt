Footnotes
IN THE END dueled inside for the early lead, eased back entering the turn, re bid two wide entering the stretch, rallied outside of KEEP IN TOUCH, dueled
with that rival, put a head in front past the sixteenth marker and edged away, driving. NO FAKE trailed the field, advanced inside on the turn, rallied on the
rail in the stretch run, closed willingly in deep stretch and was up for second at the wire. KEEP IN TOUCH dueled two wide for the lead, shook free on the
turn, dug in gamely inside of the winner in the stretch run, dueled and yielded grudgingly. SPECIAL AFFAIR raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on
the turn, angled out and rallied mildly outside. ISN'T SHE KHOZY chased inside, chased on the turn and weakened. KEEP ON ROCKIN was reluctant
loading, chased three wide, chased on the turn and weakened. SASSY ANNIE chased between rivals and faded. ROSEMARY POTATOES raced off the
rail, off the pace, came five wide into the lane and tired. CAPTURE THIS was off a bit slow, raced two wide off the pace and did not factor.

wide into the lane, then failed to rally. CENTER MID MADDIE vied two wide for the early lead, then chased between rivals, chased on the turn, came three

MADNESS tracked along the inside throughout, chased on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, responded, closed willingly and ran down the leader in
deep stretch to prevail. MOMMA KIM set the pace on the inside, pulled a bit on the clubhouse turn, showed the way on the far turn, responded when set
down, got clear in upper stretch, then dug in gamely inside in the final furlong and yielded grudgingly. MOVING IN STEREO raced two wide off the pace,
went four wide past the quarter pole, rallied mildly outside and got third. GIRLY THE BUTCHER raced off the pace with a ground saving trip, came two wide
into the lane, rallied mildly and just missed. PINK ROSE trailed the field, moved up three wide past the half mile marker, chased on the far turn and tired.
IT'S GOODTOBE JOSE stalked close up two wide, then pressed the pace, bid two wide on the far turn and faded.
