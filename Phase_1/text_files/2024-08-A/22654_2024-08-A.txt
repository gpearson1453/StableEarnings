Footnotes
GOLDEN MONEY away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside through the turn, shook clear in upper stretch under left handed urging and prevailed
under a strong hand ride. OAKEN stalked the pace into the stretch, had a mild late rally outside rivals and finished second best. CHOCOLATE RABBIT
pressured the winner two wide through the turn then was outfinished. HOPPY GILMORE trailed into the turn and passed tiring rivals through the stretch
while drifting from the two path to the six path. ATTACK ANGLE failed to menace. ACCURATE well placed, failed to respond. UNBRIDLED CAUSE was
outrun. LUNCHATTHELIZARD broke through the gate prior to the start, never got away from the assistant starter and upon being reloaded had brief speed.

Footnotes
NOT OVER YET veered out at the start, chased the leader through the turn, rallied two wide to make the lead at the top of the stretch and drew clear under
left handed urging. LIBERTALIA bobbled outward at the start, sprinted to a clear lead soon thereafter, set the pace along the inside for a half mile then was
no match for the winner while clearly second best. SO TEMPTING unhurried early, found her best stride late in the six path. LADY LOVE ME failed to
menace. LIME TREE well placed, lacked the needed response. GARDEN SECRETS was outrun. CAP IS BACK was no threat.

lead then couldn't handle the winner while gamely gaining second. KISS ME QUICK had speed from the start six wide, advanced four wide into the turn then
gain a narrow lead briefly past the three furlong marker, dropped in two wide, drifted out under left handed urging bumping the runner up in upper stretch
then was outfinished. NUBLADA close up along the inside, shifted five wide in upper stretch and finished with good courage. MANDOLIN BREEZE failed to
menace. DERBY DAY KISS had brief speed. COMPUTE THIS was hustled along the inside to gain a narrow lead before a quarter mile, was headed early
on the turn, regained a short lead soon thereafter then weakened in the stretch. SUGAR LOVES IT pressed the early pace two wide and was through after a
half. MY TWO JAKES was outrun. THE RIDER OF KISS ME QUICK LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MIESHA FOR ALLEGED

Footnotes
IAN GLASS sprinted to the front soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch, responded under left handed urging and won going away.
FLIPPING FISH pressed the pace three wide into the stretch then was no match for the winner while well clear for second. SCRIMPER pressured the
winner two wide into the turn and faded in the stretch. MORETHANREADYEDDIE stalked the pace five then four wide, offered a mild bid nearing the quarter
pole then came up empty. POWERFUL MOON had brief speed. PRIVATE DRIVE was no factor. GONE IN A FLASH trailed.
