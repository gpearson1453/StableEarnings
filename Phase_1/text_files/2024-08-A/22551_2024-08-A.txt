Footnotes
LITHE SPIRIT was unrushed inside, angled five wide at the eighth pole, rallied and was clear late under a strong hand ride. SECRET GLENDA vied inside
and couldn't hold off the winner. IMAGINE THE MOON raced in the two path, bid late but couldn't match strides. FOREVER HOME raced in the five path
and bid belatedly. TELL ME WHEN stumbled at the start, vied in the three path and faded late. GIRLS ARE TUFFER stalked the pace in the four path and
couldn't close late. HAPPY WORLD stumbled at the start, raced five wide and lacked a late bid. EYE SHADOW led between rivals and gave way in the
stretch. MAGIC BEAUTY was off awkwardly.
