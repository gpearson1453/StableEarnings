Footnotes
SUNNY WAY stalked the pace from four wide through the turn, rallied in upper stretch to engage the leaders in mid-stretch and wore down the runner-up
late in the lane to be up just in time. PRENTON pressed the pace from between rivals down the backside, cruised up while in hand to challenge for the lead
on the bend, took control turning for home, responded when challenged inside the eighth pole and was out-finished in the final strides in a good effort.
PADDY'S SPEEDSTER hustled up the fence to take the lead, set a pressured pace to the turn, was called upon into the bend to keep pace and weakened
turning for home. SUPER SENSE was slow early to drop off the leaders and was never a factor.

COUNT ON IT tracked the leaders through the turn, angled four wide turning for home, closed well through the lane and held his fellow closer safe at the
line. LINAHASPECSHOES unhurried in the early going to trail, circled five wide at the head of the lane and closed willingly unable to get to the winner.
LITTLE HARPER set the pace on a well measured lead through the turn, responded when challenged in upper stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth.
CHURCH HARBOR reserved off the pace early on, rallied into the turn to challenge in upper stretch and flattened out unable to sustain the rally in the finaal
eighth. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY prompted the pace to be in contention to mid-stretch and faded in the drive.

SILKSTONE prompted the pace for the first half mile, moved to engage the leader on the far turn, assumed command turning for home, opened a clear lead
and continued on unthreatened in the lane. ANNAMARIA reserved of the pace through the first turn, gained ground steadily down the backside to move to a
striking position on the far turn and finished willingly four wide to be along for the place. OOPS AND DOWNS unhurried while racing well wide in the first
turn, rallied on the far turn and made mild rally in the lane to be best of the rest. DARE TO COMPARE hustled early to take command, briefly opened a clear
lead down the backstretch and gave way turning for home. WHY NOT DANCE raced in contentio for the first three-eighths and was through early to be
outrun.

JOY IN GRACE prompted the pace to the quarter pole, responded when called upon to quickly take command in upper stretch and drew clear convincingly.
MACHINA tracked the leaders from four wide on the turn, rallied at the head of the lane and chased the winner through the lane to be second best. JELLI
unhurried in the early going to trail and steadily advance to be along for the show. ORANGE THEORY stalked the leaders from the fence through the turn
and finished evenly unable to mount a closing rally. ARUNDEL CASTLE urged early without much response, made amild bid into the turn and drifted wide
through the stretch having failed to menace. NIGHT FLYER set the pace on a well measured lead for the first half and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
PUTTINGONTHEFOIL pressed the pace for the first quarter, took command midway on the bend, opened a clear lead in upper stretch and drew off handiily
as much best. ROWDY TOWN stalked the pace from three wide through the turn, rallied turning for home and finished willingly as a clear second best.
HOLIDAY'S AGAIN was slow early inspite of urging to keep pace, settled near the rear, found his best stride straightening out for home. MR MIEZIE
showed early speed to set a pressured pace while drifting in to crowd rival in the first eighth, dueled on the pace to the quarter pole and weakened in the
lane. WHATWOMENWANT raced up the fence just of the pace was crowded when the pacesetter angled in in the first hundred yards, was further impeded
having to steady nearing the nine-sixteenths pole and went evenly from there having lost all momentum. TABULA ROSSO was well palced in contention
from five wide into the turn and faded midway on the bend. BUCK SPRINGS was never a factor. THE RIDER OF WHATWOMENWANT CLAIMED FOUL
AGAINST MR MIEZIE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FIRST EIGHTH OF A MILE, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
DONTBRINGMEDOWN set a well measured pace on a comfortable lead to the quarter ppole, widened the advantage when called upon and finished
unchallenged in the lane as a convincing winner. PATRIOTIC FREEDOM stalked the pace from four wide to midway on the turn, was set to a long drive on
the bend and ground his way to be clearly second best. CAPE'S LEGACY reserved off the pace to the head of the lane and mounted a belated rally inside
the eighth pole to be up for the show. WHEN U KNOW U KNOW rated in mid-pack and rallied mildly in the lane without impact. WE THE FRINGE pressed
the pace to midway on the turn and steadily faded coming home. LEGAL ASSASSIN well placed in striking distance of the leaders from the rail and
weakened through the stretch. HARRY'S A HOTTIE was not a factor. GENESEE was the distant trailer, not persevered with, eased quarter pole and walked
off.
