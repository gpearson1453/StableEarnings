Footnotes
SHUT IT CALI unhurried in the early going, angled in to the rail down the backside, tipped out three wide when commencing his rally midway on the turn,
closed ground rapidly on the leader in upper stretch and pulled away quickly while still in hand through the lane as much the best. AIN'T NONCENTS
tracked the pace from four wide to the turn, rallied on the bend to take command turning for home, opened a clear lead in upper stretch, had no response
when engaged by the winner but kept-on well to be second best. PRACTICAL MISS reserved off the pace to the five-sixteenths pole, circled five wide at the
quarter pole and finished willingly to be best of the rest. WILD GIRL was well placed just off the leaders along the fence in the turn, was set to a drive on the
bend and failed to respond. FIFTH CIRCUIT stalked the pace in striking position from three wide to the top of the lane and lacked a closing kick finishing
evenly. HUMOR SENSE set the pace under steady pressure and weakened turning for home. MANITOULIN ISLAND trailed most of the way never posing a
threat. CORINTH pressed the pace in the early going and steadily gave way. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using
video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

MAINSTREAM SELLOUT tracked the leaders while well in hand for the first three-quarters, commenced a rally midway on the far turn circling four wide
turning for home and closed well to reel in the pacesetter in deep stretch. PLEASE MARRY ME set the pace on a well rated, well measured lead to the top
of the lane, responded when called upon to maintain the advantage and was caught late in the drive to be second best. CAT ONE broke alertly only to be
taken in hand away from the gate, raced up the fence down the straightaway the first time having to be steadied into the first turn, stalked the leader from
the fence all the way and lacked a closing kick when called upon. SAVE THE FLAG trailed for the first five-eighths and made a belated rally in the lane
showing some late interest. HAZELMOOR BEACH went evenly posing no threat. HOUSE OF MELODY prompted the pace to the far turn, was set to a drive
on the bend, lacked a response and weakened through the lane. TITOSCHANGEDMYLUCK showed brief early speed and was through after a half mile.

OXYMORE broke alertly to take command from the gate, set a well rated pace while well in hand, responded when called upon in uper stretch and was
unchallenged through the lane. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA slow early to be at the rear of the pack, circled the field turning for home and closed well to be gaining
late. BRUDER tracked the pacesetter from two wide through the turn and rallied mildly in the lane failing to threaten. NINTH OF APRIL raced near the rear
of the field early and made a steady postional gain while racing erratically down the lane. ROCKLAND EXPRESS failed to menace. SPEAKERIT well placed
for the first three-eighths and faded in the lane. MICHEAUX hustled away from the gate to pressure the leader early, was taken up slightly entering the turn
off heels and dropped back tiring in the stretch.

Footnotes
WATERING had an equipment repair at the gate causing a slight delay, broke near the rear of the filed, settled in hand early, steadily advanced between
rivals into the turn and closed well in the lane to rundown the leader in deep stretch in a determined drive. READY TO ROCKNROLL stalked the pace from
the inside through the turn, tipped out turning for home , collared the pacesetter inside the eighth pole to take command and was caught in the final yards in
a good effort. HIT SONG tracked the leaders from five wide on the backstretch, commenced a rally on the turn only to have to be taken in hand when
JUDITH'S CROSS clipped heels and was taken up in her path, re-rallied turning for home and closed well belatedly. MUN MUN CAN RUN was well placed
along the fence in the second flight, avoided the trouble just ahead of her and rallied in the lane grindingly. SLANDEROUS set the pace opening a clear
advantage on the turn and weakened in the drive. MINNESOTA MUNNY was slow early to trail and showed alte energy passing tiring rivals in the stretch.
GIRL OF FAITH reserved racing between horses on the backside and lacked a closing response. ROCIO went evenly having never posed a threat.
JUDITH'S CROSS prompted the early pace from two wide, clipped heels into the turn having to be steadied and faded from that point on having lost all
momentum. ORQUIDEA REAL rushed up the fence to challenge in the first quarter mile, lacked racing room, broke through the rail unseating the rider and
walked off.

Footnotes
SILVER FRONT was well placed on the inside throughout, waited for room leaving the turn and made a bid getting thru by the furlong marker and drew
clear under mild urging to prove best. GUILDENSTERN (IRE) was bumped at the start, then was keen early and moved out from the inside on the turn, then
made a three wide move by the quarter pole, then vied for command by the furlong marker but was out-kicked by the winner while being clearly second
best. ROJA REDEMPTION was settled on the inside, eased out on the far turn and came four wide into the lane and was along for the show award. GREEN
BEANS set the pace on the inside to the two path, came two wide off the turn and was passed to the inside and outside, then steadied when trying to angle
out and weakened. VALUE ENGINEER stalked the pace two wide and then was ridden along nearing the quarter pole and weakened. WILL'S MUSIC was
settled three wide and tired.

Footnotes
BUCARO reserved off the pace to the quarter pole, circled five wide turning for home, lugged in through the lane and closed well while being kept off rivals
to be up in time. NOLA BOSS dueld on the lead from two wide to upper stretch, took command in the lane and was out-finished in the final yards. WAR
HUMOR stalked the pace from the fence, rallied in the lane to be prominent and was outkicked late in the drvie. BUY TOM A BEER unhurried in the early
going to race near the rear of the field for the first three-eighths and mounted a belated five wide rally down the stretch. WHENEVERUREMEMBER showed
early foot to be with the leaders, settled into a tracking position through the turn and idled in the lane lacking racing room. MOON FACTOR dueled from the
fence on the lead to the head of the stretch and weakened. GOTTA HAVE A GUY trailed most of the way and passd tiring rivals late. DEMENTOR was no
threat. GO TO BINGO well placed three wide on the turn and flattened out in the lane. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed
using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SHARE THE BLESSING reserved off the pace in mid-pack through the turn, rallied six wide splitting rivals in the stretch and finished best of all to prevail.
HEART unhurried early on, continued to be at the rear of the main body turning for home and closed with a belated rush from eight wide. TRULY
GRATEFUL rated in hand down the backside off the pace, commenced a seven wide rally in the lane and closed well to be gaining late. BEANPOT sped to
the lead, opened up on the field turning for home and coud not hold on when outkicked inside the final sixteenth. ST. SUSAN raced in mid-pack from four
wide through the turn, rallied to loom in mid-stretch and was unable to sustain the bid. RUN AROUND SLEW pressed the pacesetter from two wide to upper
stretch and kept-on down the lane unable to close ground late. SWEETCATHERINEROSE prompted the pace from three wide to be prominent in
mid-stretch and finished evenly. CHARLOTTES ROAD stalked the pace to be in contention in upper stretch and did not have enough to compete in the
stretch drive. ATMIDNIGHT slow early to trail and was never a threat. JE SUIS RAPIDE trailed most of the way and was never a factor. WRIGHT UP
FRONT chased the leaders from five wide through the turn and tired inside the eighth pole.

Footnotes
LONELY RIDE was settled back early, saved ground on the far turn and cut the corner leaving the turn, closed full of run to edged clear late to prove best
under a drive. ADMIRAL'S WAVE was settled early, three wide on the turn, came five wide off the turn and finished well and led leaving the sixteenth
marker but was outfinished late by the winner. MY SANCTUARY was settled back early, came four wide off the turn and then moved out and finished well to
best the rest. EL GUAPO set the pace while clear and then opened up a huge lead and maintained a clear lead to the furlong marker but had nothing left
late while saving the last spot in the superfecta. DIABLO DADDY was settled two to three wide, came three wide off the turn and had no kick. WHERE'S
CHARLIE was void of early speed, three wide by the quarter pole and offered a belated rally. RETURN FIRE chased the loose pacesetter on the inside,
came two wide off the turn but lacked the needed winning bid. BALI ROLLING TIDE was reserved on the inside and tired.

Footnotes
MANDATORY MEETING pressed the pace from two wide through the first turn, continued to duel on the lead while well held down the backstretch,
disposed of the inside pressure nearing the quarter pole to take command in upper stretch, was immediately engaged midway down the lane and battled
gamely in a determined drive to prevail. SMART UNCLE stalked the pace from the fence for three quarters, cut the corner turning for home launching a bid,
lacked room midway down the lane, took up off heels, angled out to the clear and surged late to just miss in a valiant effort. OSKAR MARTINEZ (IRE)
prompted the pace from three wide for the first half mile while hard held, rallied on the final bend to engage the leader in mid-stretch and was out-finished
late while racing between horses in a good try. BEE PLUS hustled leaving the gate after a slow start, raced mid-pack along the fence through the far turn
and mounted a good belated rally finding his best stride late. FALL LINE well placed tracking the leaders from three wide and lacked a clsoing kick in the
lane. SPIN IT reserved in mid-field to the far turn and lacked a response when called upon midway on the final bend. VARVATOS dueled on the pace for
three-quarters and gradually weakened through the stretch. NEON NIGHTS failed to menace. PACE YOURSELF trailed early and never posed a threat.
WAXING MOON was not a factor.
