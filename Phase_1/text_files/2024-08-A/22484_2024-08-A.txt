at the wire. CHAPARRITA chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend, switched to the outside in upper
stretch and gained ground late. HOTASAPISTOL was away from the gate a bit slowly, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and improved position in the stretch. FREEBRITNEY raced off the pace on the inside early, trailed the field from the three path coming
around the bend and made up some ground in the lane while never truly threatening. PACIFIC ZIP raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and faded in the lane. FIRENSPICE led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the rail
around the bend and tired in the stretch.
