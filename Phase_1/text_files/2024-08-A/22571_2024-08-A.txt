Footnotes
LEGITIMIZE went to the front then was taken in hand, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside under a hold, responded well when asked under
threat near the five-sixteenths pole, came under a right-handed crop outside the eighth-pole, turned away the runner-up in the final furlong and held under
strong urging. PASSIVE MANAGEMENT (GB) went three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside while given some cover under tight restraint,
ranged up three wide when let out on the far turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths pole, was given his cue coming to the quarter-pole, drifted out some in
upper stretch then was straightened by the rider, pursued the winner to the finish and willingly earned the place. STOP THE PRESS broke out but was
quickly corrected by the rider then coaxed from the gate, saved ground while rated just off the pace under a snug hold, tugged hard on the bit late on the
backstretch, bumped with a foe while coming off the inside near the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back to the rail early on the far turn, was asked near the
five-sixteenths pole, shifted to the two path outside the quarter-pole, was driven four wide into upper stretch, moved out outside the furlong marker, swapped
back to his left lead inside that marker and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. BADGE OF WAR stumbled at the start then brushed with a rival
while off at the rear, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved at the back of the field, came under urging in the three path early on the far turn then
moved to the four path, turned into the stretch in the six path and lacked the needed response. TRULLI WARRIOR brushed with a rival at the start, saved
ground while reserved off the pace, moved off the rail early on the far turn then shifted to the three path under urging, turned into upper stretch under a drive
and failed to respond. PROSPERO (IRE) went around the first turn in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, bumped with a rival late on the
backstretch then was asked, chased in the three then two path on the far turn, dropped back approaching the quarter-pole and had nothing left.

LOOMS BOLDLY established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn patiently handled despite pressure from the runner up to the outside, took the inside route into upper stretch, got roused near the
three-sixteenths and edged clear under a drive to prevail. FACTUALLY CORRECT coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace of the aforementioned foe from
the outside five paths off the rail down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch shaken off, dug in under a drive running on to preserve the place honors. LIGHT MAN coaxed from the start, chased three then two
wide coming under coaxing at the half mile pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, kept on to procure the show honors. SHERIFF BIANCO stumbled at
the start and was bumped by OCEAN'S RESERVE and conceded two lengths to the front, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. OCEAN'S RESERVE broke out at the start bumping SHERIFF BIANCO, chased just off the inside and
then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. ROTKNEE stumbled at the start
conceding two lengths to the front, ranged up six paths off the inside down the backstretch to be just off the top pair, tucked four wide through the turn and
came under brief light coaxing and was given a sole tap on the right shoulder with the crop at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch backing
away and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
EIGHTY WEST was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear under a strong-hand ride in
upper stretch, was given one pop of a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and drew off under a solid-hand ride from that point to the finish.
FRIDAY SURPRISE was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the two then three path on the turn, lugged in while
pursuing the winner in the stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. TAPWRITS TEMPER moved in while ridden along off the pace, went
around the turn in the two path, drifted out inside the three-sixteenths pole and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. PLAY THE GRAY broke a
step slow, was urged along towards the back, moved from the two path to the rail early on the turn, came back off the rail outside the five-sixteenths pole,
shifted to the three then four path shortly thereafter while getting closer to the front, dropped inward in upper stretch and failed to rally. STORM THE
STREETS broke in and was off a bit awkwardly then bumped with a foe, chased the pace on the outside, raced in the three then four path on the turn, spun
into the stretch in the five path and tired. STRENGTHNGUIDANCE stumbled twice just after the start, was urged along on the far outside, went around the
turn in the four then five path and faltered then was eased but walked off. KY ANANSI unseated the jockey behind the gate then was loaded riderless,
bumped with a foe at the start, was hard ridden at the rear, saved ground on the turn and showed little.

ASPEN GROVE (IRE) settled just off the inside tracking from just off the pace, advanced into the far turn and came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole,
took over command and swung three wide into upper stretch, edged away before coming under growing threat to the outside and dug in gamely to prevail
repelling the challenger to the finish. AVENUE NIEL (IRE) saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, tipped to the two path at the five-sixteenths and then
continued out placed to a drive to swing six wide into upper stretch, rallied willingly inside the final furlong but was ultimately rebuffed to the finish. BE YOUR
BEST (IRE) coaxed from the gate, attended the leader from the outside three wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive and ran on to secure the show honors. SABALENKA saved ground near the rear of the field, came under urging with
seven-sixteenths to go, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. DREAMING OF MO bobbled at the break, chased three to four
wide patiently handled until set down angled five wide into upper stretch, made no late headway. ELLE EST FORTE settled just off the inside near the rear
of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. LADY EMILY KATHRYN established the front and
showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front and cut the corner into upper stretch, then tired in the
drive.

Footnotes
CARARRA chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
took over command inside the eighth pole and inched away under a drive to prevail. BOURBON SERENGETI coaxed from the gate, showed the way in
hand along the inside, took the inside route into upper stretch and was roused at the three-sixteenths, got collared inside the eighth pole, ran on clear for the
place honors. STREET VIEW coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper
stretch, offered up a bid then kept on to the finish well clear for the show honors. THE TACO LADY three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. I'M THINKING coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, tipped three wide into upper stretch, weakened. CLASSY MISCHIEF chased three to four wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered no response. CELESTIAL EXPRESS chased three then two wide coming under prolonged
coaxing from the half mile pole, faded through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
LARK'S MISCHIEF moved in while going to the front then showed the way with a clear advantage, controlled the action in the two path on the turn,
responded well when asked turning into upper stretch, dropped in inside the three-sixteenths pole, was put to a left-handed crop approaching the furlong
marker, drifted out under threat from the runner-up in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and just held under strong urging. RADICAL RIGHT settled on the
outside, was roused while dropping from the three path to the two path early on the turn, chased in the three path into the stretch, pursued the winner under
a drive into the final furlong, was carried out some near the sixteenth-pole, drew alongside the winner late and just missed. LOST IN ROME was restless in
the gate, steadied briefly while in tight between foes after the start, was urged along towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path, moved out in
upper stretch and lacked the needed response while up for the show. DANGEROUS RIDE was hustled from the gate then ridden along off the pace,
dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, saved ground from that point into the stretch, moved out while pursuing the top two near the furlong
marker and tired then lost the show. NELSON AVENUE chased the pace, traveled around the turn in the four path, turned into upper stretch under a drive
and came up empty. GOOD JUJU took an awkward stride at the rear early then dropped well behind under urging, moved out leaving the backstretch,
rounded the turn in the three path, turned into the stretch in the four path and was no factor. PIPES AND DRUMS chased the pace, went around the turn in
the five path, floated out to the seven path into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
GOATS ON A TREE went five then four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the four then three
path on the far turn, took the lead in the four path into the stretch then drifted about while kicking clear and drew away under steady urging. SWEET
DUTCHESS raced in the three path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, took the advantage late on the backstretch, vied in the three then
two path on the far turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage in the three path into upper stretch and proved no match for the winner
while able to get the place. TURF ROCKET saved ground on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, steadied some while shuffled back behind a
fading KANNON FIRE at the seven-sixteenths pole, angled out to the four path before the three-eighths pole then chased the leaders, was driven into the
stretch in the five path, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened while far clear for the show. NINJA ABARRIO went four wide
for most of the first turn then dropped back between horses, moved to the five path late on that bend, was urged along on the backstretch, went around the
far turn in the five path, floated into the stretch in the seven path and failed to respond. DREAM CENTRAL raced in the two to three path on the turns and
also failed to respond. KANNON FIRE went to the front, traveled around the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, lost the lead
with a half-mile to run, came up empty on the far turn and stopped then was eased in the stretch but walked off.
