Footnotes
HOUSE BOURBON sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground, was challenged around the final turn, with rivals racing head and head, shook loose
down the lane and proved the best. ATHENS MOON unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the inside around the second turn, dueled down the stretch
with FIRST CLASS HARLOW for the place position and was just up. FIRST CLASS HARLOW pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down
the lane and was outfinished for second. MO SATURDAYS pressed the early pace, raced close throughout and weakened down the home stretch.
DUMBSTRUCK lacked early speed and raced evenly near the back. EL PERFECTO broke out, racing in the rear, moved up on the outside around the
second turn and faded. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN always raced near the back and was outrun. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

BELLO CREEDO went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and held on for the win. MUFFIN NUTS unhurried, racing in the middle of the field, made a
late bid and was outfinished for the win, after having to steady a couple times coming down the stretch. CHAOSMOS lacked early speed, gained ground
late, but was no match for the top two. HANKS raced near the back in the early going, came around the final turn wide, made a mild bid, but was no factor.
MINNESOTA MIRACLE pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and faded down the home stretch. DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) was bumped and
squeezed back at the start, quickly moved up to race within contention, before fading down the lane. BLEEP BLEEP was an early factor and made a steady
retreat. SILVER N LAI lacked early speed and was never close. JAZZY JUSTIN pressed the pace, racing four wide around the first turn and dropped back.
SWIFT N TRAFFIC broke out, showed brief speed and retreated to the back.

Footnotes
KAN SHE dueled on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear down the lane, racing four wide and finished well. EARLY DAWN vied for the
early lead, saved ground around the turn, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. CUSTOM CANDY pressed the pace, raced close
throughout, but proved no match for the top two. GRACE'S SOLDIER void of early speed, made a late bid, racing on the inside and was outfinished for
show. RUN NATALIE RUN lacked early speed, raced evenly near the middle of the field and was never a factor. NATURALBORNSENDER raced near the
back, came around the turn on the outside and showed little. ENOUGH HEART broke sharp, pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn and faded.
FLYING I raced near the back, trailed late and was outrun.

moved up on the outside around the second turn, made a wide bid, couldn't catch the winner, but got up for second. COURT JESTER pressed the pace,
forwardly placed throughout and was caught late for second. GAMER NATE raced within striking distance, came around the second turn on the outside and
lacked a late rally. MO CREDO raced within contention, saved ground around the final turn and faded. SEEHOSS went to the front, drove clear, saved
ground and dropped back.

Footnotes
HAWAIIAN ARGUMENT unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a wide rally and was going away at the end. F J'S
FLACO vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner late, but was a clear second. DYNAMIC SUN raced in the
middle of the field, made a mild bid and proved no match for the top two. ALLER VITE dueled for the early advantage, drove clear around the turn and
lacked a finish. HAY DIDDLE DIDDLE pressed the early pace, saved ground around the turn and weakened. DOCE DE LA NOCHE raced evenly near the
back and was never a factor. NEPHI lacked early speed and showed little. ADMIRAL AFLEET flashed brief speed and dropped to the back.
