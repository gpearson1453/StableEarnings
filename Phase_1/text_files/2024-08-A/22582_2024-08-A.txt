SHE'S A BANDIT showed early speed, forwardly placed throughout and weakened down the home stretch. SHE'S A TARGET lacked early speed, came
around the turn wide, showed late interest, but was no factor. DIAMOND EMPRESS raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn, made a
bid, faded and was no threat late. LOVE IN THE DARK lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn, moved up, but was no factor. PRECIOUS
MONEY void of early speed and showed little. MISS CHEESE BREAD raced in the middle of the field, had an inside trip and faded. GRACEFUL STAR

and was outfinished for the win. DIAMOND COUNTRY pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. GEMMY
showed early speed, saved ground around the turn, angled out entering the home stretch, made a bid, steadied late and was vanned off. SASSI JOLIE got
loose before the start, broke a step slow, had a wide trip and was no factor. STOLEN BULLET raced evenly near the back, came around the turn on the
outside and was never a threat. AMELIES DREAMER lacked early speed, finished wide and showed little.

Footnotes
RIVER RAFT unhurried in the beginning, made a steady gain, moved up on the outside around the second turn, made a wide rally and proved the best late.
INSIGNIS lacked early speed, saved ground around the final turn, rallied down the lane, split rivals and finished willingly. RED IDOL pressed the pace,
forwardly placed throughout, was outfinished, while putting forth a game effort. THREE GOLD PIECES raced evenly near the middle of the pack, made a
late bid and was outfinished. NATIVE STAR pressed the early pace, saved ground around the second turn and weakened. JOEY'S LIGHTENING raced
within contention in the early going and faded down the home stretch. SHAWN'S SOLVING sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded.
SCORING DRIVE lacked early speed and was never a threat. TARAASHOQ void of early speed, showed little and was eased to the wire. I DON'T VENMO
hopped at the start, raced in the back, was never close and eased to the wire.

HARD EXIT went to the front, drove clear, led throughout, was all out and held off SUGAR CANE GAL for the win. SUGAR CANE GAL void of early speed,
made a steady gain, rallied down the lane and needed more ground. ABBEY CAKES raced within striking distance, was close throughout and proved no
match for the top two. TIZ A BREAKUP lacked early speed, came around the turn wide, made a mild bid down the stretch, but was no factor. SILK NOT
SATIN pressed the early pace and faded. FIRST CLASS GIRL raced within contention, saved ground around the turn and faded. WITH A SONG lacked
early speed, moved up on the outside around the turn and dropped back.

BUTLER CABIN lacked early speed, racing in the back, moved up down the home stretch, angled to the inside and was just up. WICKED TRICK void of
early speed, raced outside around the final turn, made a wide bid and just missed. NORTHERNREFLECTION went to the front, drove clear, saved ground
around the second turn and was outfinished by the top two. CRIMSON STORM pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and weakened down
