Footnotes
RIDE THE RAPIDS broke inward then settled inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, took the nod inside the eighth pole
and was steadily handled to hold on well. BEST VIRGINIA saved early ground well off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the three path and steadily
improved, circled rivals in the five path on the far turn, finished well and cleared second later yards. BOUNDTOBEOK settled in the three path the first turn,
picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and dueled to even terms in the three path approaching the head of the lane, but flattened stride inside
the eighth pole. QUANTICO CREEK raced in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail
and flattened in the lane. CLEARLY VISIBLE raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened off the
rail on the far turn. ABOVE PAR exchanged contact with. WINDSOR'S PLAY leaving the gate then raced with the pace inside, came under pressure leaving
the three eighths pole, gave up the lead off the rail approaching the head of the lane and weakened in the drive. The latter exchanged contact with Above
Par and was pinched back a stride after the break, raced with the pace two deep then gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, but weakened off the rail
on the far turn. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected, a claim of foul against the rider of Ride The Rapids for alleged interference leaving the gate, lodged

G'S FIREBALL moved to the inside approaching the first turn then stalked, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased out
entering the stretch, dug in for the lead toward the sixteenth pole and drew off. SWEET FACTOR angled in near the three quarter pole then steadied off the
inside flank of G's Fireball approaching the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, altered course mid-stretch and
dug in to take second the final strides. SPEEDY BUBBLES took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to show the way, came
under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then gave up the lead near mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth.
THE MONEY MACHINE stalked off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, was carried out leaving
the far turn and flattened in the lane. PAYNT YOUR WAY settled in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn about the five path, was forced out entering the stretch and showed little further. LINDA'S TAJ stalked two deep the first turn, gave chase leaving
the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail most of the far turn, angled out approaching the head of the lane and flattened stride. VAN HOOK came
away a bit awkwardly and was shuffled back approaching the three quarter pole, settled inside on the first turn and showed little response. SISTER SPIRIT
raced in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the six path.
The Stewards reviewed, then rejected, a claim of foul against the rider of G's Fireball for alleged interference entering the first turn, lodged by the rider of

Footnotes
UNCLE PRESS stalked off the rail the first turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, eased out entering the stretch,
closed to the lead mid-stretch and was kept sharp to draw away. BLAZE FOR DAZE rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the quarter
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, was steadily handled leaving the turn but gave up the lead while flattening stride mid-stretch. FAPPIANO HALO
rounded the first turn about the five path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and came along to take third late
yards. GETTIN SPICY stalked inside the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, then flattened in the
lane. LITTLE RICHIE stalked from the three path the opening turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and
showed little further. COLONIAL ROAD rounded the opening turn about the four path, raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response.
YAREAKH was shuffled back at the three quarter pole, steadied into the first turn and mostly saved ground.
