Footnotes
JACK'S MAGIC GIRL traveled in mid-pack along the inside, hugged the rail through the far turn, tipped out and drew alongside the leader at the eighth pole,
quickly took over and won going away. CAITLIN FEVER raced up close in the two path then applied pressure from outside, dueled around the far turn and
took over past the quarter pole, put away inner rival in upper stretch but was soon tested by the winner at the eighth pole, yielded midstretch and kept on to
hold second. SEA RUNNER pulled early two wide then stalked outside a rival, chased between on the far turn, three wide into the lane and gained the show
honors. HEY LIL LADY well placed in the early going along the fence, tipped two wide past the quarter pole, moved out in upper stretch and lacked late
punch. RAPIDA sat off the pace in the three path, moved into range three deep on the backstretch, exited the far turn four wide, shifted inward in upper
stretch and could not rally. LADY LOLLIPOP pulled on the inside then two wide around the clubhouse turn, traveled between runners in the middle stages,
chased two wide then a bit off the rail into the lane and was not a factor. APOCALYPTIC laid off the pace off the rail, three deep up the backstretch, rounded
the far turn three then two wide and could not make an impact. GLOBAL CONSORT took control early from inside, set the pace under pressure to the far
turn, headed at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command late on the turn, yielded in upper stretch and gave way. THIRSTY DESTINY reserved to the back and
moved inside, trailed on the fence to the stretch and was always outrun.

Footnotes
ASIAN MATRIARCH raced up close four then three wide early, remained wide up the backstretch, spun four wide into the lane, drew alongside the
runner-up at the sixteenth pole and drove past. DEMOTIVATE broke a step slow and was coaxed along early at the back, made an early bid between rivals
at the half-mile pole to take control, dueled from outside and lost command around the far turn, regained the advantage in upper stretch but got outkicked by
the winner in the late stages. HAYWOOD tracked four to five wide around the clubhouse turn, trailed up the backstretch, rallied five deep on the second
bend but flattened out late. CHASING RAIN tracked along the rail, drew closer in hand in the middle stages, lost ground into the far turn, crept closer on the
fence around the bend, tipped out in the lane and faltered. MIDNIGHT LOVE pressed from outside then got bumped by inner rival and took over at the
three-quarter pole, vied three deep at the halfway point, chased the top pair three wide through the far turn, got crowded in upper stretch, then altered out
into the clear and could not rally. J B STRIKES BACK cleared and crossed over, became rank on the clubhouse turn and drifted out to bump MIDNIGHT
LOVE leaving the bend, vied inside a pair of rivals at the half-mile pole, regained the lead dueling on the far turn, lost command in upper stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
TALKLESSWORKMORE sped clear and opened up a comfortable lead, received a challenge from DONT FIGH THE FED on the far turn, dueled into the
stretch, lost command in upper stretch, battled back through the final furlong and dug in to win a narrow photo. DONT FIGHT THE FED lost a shoe early on
the clubhouse turn stalking in the two path, followed out of range in the middle stages, drew closer early on the far turn then bid two wide past the
five-sixteenths pole, dueled and took over in upper stretch, battled head to head in the furlong grounds and got edged on the line. CARDIFF CRACK settled
inside, ridden along the fence through the far turn, asked right handed into the lane, moved off the inside and outfinished BIG GEORGE for third. BIG
GEORGE tucked inside at the back, trailed to the far turn, angled out and came four wide into the lane, kept on through the late stages but got denied for
the show honors. BEE EYE GEE laid off the pace three deep early, traveled outside a rival on the backstretch, rounded the far turn two to three wide and
lacked the needed response. HACKING IT UP reserved in the two path, moved inside and made some progress in the middle stages, followed the leader
around the far turn and tired in the stretch. HANDSOME RED reserved along the inside, sustained an injury at the five-eighths pole, pulled up and was
transported off the track via equine ambulance.

Footnotes
RED FLAG showed the way early with GOOD WITH PEOPLE alongside, maintained command along the rail through the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch
and drew away under right handed urging and steady handling. CHASIN MUNNY raced up behind the top pair on the inside, tipped out leaving the bend
and entered the lane three wide, finished determinedly in the drive but could only gain second. GOOD WITH PEOPLE prompted the pace from outside to
the top of the stretch, could not keep up with the winner approaching the furlong grounds and was overtaken for second late. LEFT HAND MAN chased in
range up the backstretch, ridden along in the two path when starting to lose ground, came four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. TERRY'S BOY
broke alertly then ceded command and took a stalking position off the rail, lost ground three wide on the turn and weakened down the lane. CURRY
unhurried in the beginning then started to climb at the back, passed a rival on the turn and saved ground to the stretch but proved no menace. SANTOS TO
WILSON sat off the pace early, went three wide into the turn, trailed past the three-eighths pole while moving into the two path, went three wide into the lane
and was never a factor.

Footnotes
TOP HARBOR forwardly placed four then three deep up the backstretch, drew alongside the leader at the three-eighths pole, dueled into the lane, took over
in upper stretch, cleared into the final sixteenth and held over the late run from the runner-up. JOHNNY PODRES got put crowded a bit between runners
early and settled at the rear, saved ground through the turn, tipped out into the lane, angled out further and unleashed a rally from outside but ran out of
time. AGENCY sped clear and steered over to the inside, challenged by TOP HARBOR at the three-eighths pole, dueled into the stretch, lost command in
upper stretch, stayed on from inside and lost second late. MUBTADAA drifted in and bumped early, chased off the rail then moved inside, went two wide
around the bend, summoned a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta. HARRY'S ONTHEFLY stalked between rivals, coaxed along on the turn, roused
two wide into the lane and finished evenly late. ZOFFARELLI (IRE) got bumped and crowded early, moved inside, lacked room in upper stretch, moved out
and improved position. CANE CREEK ROAD stalked three deep between rivals, got put in tight and steadied at the seven-sixteenths pole, remained three
deep to the stretch and weakened. COULTHARD (IRE) stalked from the fence inside rivals, hugged the rail to the stretch and also weakened. LOVESICK
BLUES broke in and bumped rival then got bumped and pinched between rivals shortly after, raced outside a rival at the back, trailed two wide into the
stretch and failed to menace. STANDING O bumped in the beginning then got bumped and pinched back between rivals, chased from off the pace to the
turn, rounded the bend three then two wide and was never a factor. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INVOLVING THE EARLY PORTION OF THE RACE, THE
STEWARDS RULED THAT MULTIPLE RUNNERS WERE INVOLVED IN CAUSING INTERFERENCE AND NO BLAME COULD BE ATTACHED TO A
SPECIFIC ENTRANT SO THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

turn, loomed three wide into the lane, drew alongside with a furlong remaining and wore down the runner-up in the last sixteenth to get up near the wire.
SEISMIC BEAUTY bumped inner rival in the beginning, went up to vie three deep up the backstretch, dueled from outside around the turn, inched ahead
past the quarter pole, pressured by ONE MAGIC PHILLY through the final furlong, resisted into the final strides and was overtaken at the wire. ACCURACY
traveled along the inside off the pace, moved into range on the turn, angled four wide past the quarter pole and finished willingly to earn third. PHILIPPA
chased off the rail then moved inside, tipped to the two path around the bend, asked right handed in the lane but could not summon the needed late kick.
DASHINGLY vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals to the turn, dueled with outer rival around the bend, yielded in upper stretch and weakened. SWEET
GEM got bumped leaving the gate then lost her path early, coaxed along off the pace, went two wide into the turn, moved to the inside then a bit off the rail

Footnotes
FERRARIANO stalked from inside, drew closer on the far turn, tipped two wide at the quarter pole, latched onto the leader in upper stretch, dueled into the
final sixteenth and dug in to edge the runner-up. LORD TRIPPING stepped to the front and moved inside, showed the way up the backstretch, took pressure
at the seven-sixteenths pole, cleared at the five-sixteenths marker, challenged by FERRARIANO in upper stretch, dueled into deep stretch and relinquished
the lead late. TAKES THREE reserved on the inside, moved into range on the far turn, asked right handed into the lane, bid under a left handed crop in the
final furlong and finished a game third. DEVIL BE ME raced up close outside the leader then stalked up the backstretch, drew alongside again at the
seven-sixteenths pole, could not sustain the challenge and chased two then three wide past the five-sixteenths pole and weakened down the lane. UNCLE
JOHN rank two wide then between rivals, continued between to the far turn, drew closer around that bend, tipped out in upper stretch and flattened.
MOGOLLON RIM tucked inside at the back, passed a rival on the far turn, continued inside to the stretch and passed tired foes. EL REY DORADO rated
three then two wide on the clubhouse turn, crept closer outside the top pair on the backstretch, raced in the five path turning for home and weakened.
BERT'S PROSPECT settled four then three wide early, moved into range four deep in the middle stages, lost ground four then three wide on the far turn
and had little left for the drive. NEXT FLIGHT false broke then hopped at the start, raced near the back off the rail early, three deep at the halfway point,
trailed past the five-sixteenths pole and came up empty.

strong handling. BETTER THAN GOLD lost his path shortly after the start, tucked inside off the pace, advanced while angling out n the far turn, tipped out
further in the lane, rallied late but could not reach the winner. CORNELL stalked four then three wide early, dropped out of range then drew closer again
approaching the far turn, asked right handed along the inside late on the bend, cut the corner into the stretch, finished evenly in the late stages and lost
second. SHORTMAN broke a step slow, lagged behind to the far turn, was on the move from inside through the bend, elected to stay near the inside in the
drive and finished with a mild rally to round out the superfecta. BIG HAT WILLIE tracked in the two path then shifted to the inside, moved into range quickly
on the backstretch, bid three deep on the far turn, chased the leader into the lane and flattened out. WENDELSSOHN dueled from outside to the far turn,
asked to keep up around the bend, lost touch with the leader into the lane and weakened. FIFTH STREET tracked five then four wide on the clubhouse turn,
traveled outside rivals up the backstretch, ridden along five wide on the far turn, moved inward in the lane and lacked a rally. SMART MO stalked in the two
path early, started to weaken four then five wide on the far turn and tired. CLOUSEAU unhurried in the three path, stayed off the rail up the backstretch,
came out on the far turn and entered the lane six wide and could not make an impact. BIRTH OF COOL stalked four then three wide early on, raced
between foes off the pace at the midway point, lacked response when roused on the far turn, spun four wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
ON THE WHIM rated along the rail early, closest in pursuit of the lone leader past the half-mile pole, drew closer and took aim two wide entering the stretch,
challenged from outside with a furlong left to run, took over near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. PROOF HE RIDES away quickly to take control and
moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch, confronted by ON THE WHIM at the eighth pole, yielded in deep stretch and held the place. NONE ABOVE
THE LAW reserved off the rail then moved inside approaching the clubhouse turn, hugged the rail to the stretch, altered out midstretch and went between
rivals to close for the show honors. CARMELITA'S MAN came in and bumped rival leaving the chute, traveled two wide between foes on the clubhouse turn,
coaxed along into the far turn, spun three wide into the lane, moved out and finished with late run. COALINGA ROAD tucked inside at the rear, trailed to the
stretch, stayed on the fence and summoned a mild rally but missed a minor award. OLD PAL settled toward the back and moved into the two path, raced
outside a rival into the far turn, swung out and raced six wide turning for home and offered a mild response when called upon. PASSARANDO broke out a
bit but was quickly corrected, got bumped and pinched back between rivals leaving the chute, moved to the inside, saved ground from off the pace, ridden
along on the far turn, tipped out at the top of the lane and kept on between foes late. BARELY FUNTIONAL stalked three then two wide in the early going,
raced in mid-pack up the backstretch, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. CATALINA EDDY became rank between rivals entering the stretch for
the first time, fought the rider a bit into the clubhouse turn, tugged under a hold, moved inside on the backstretch, chased in range on the far turn, asked
right handed leaving the bend and weakened in the late stages. OUBABE chased from off the pace, ran three wide around the first turn, moved out on the
second bend, entered the lane in the five path and failed to menace. DISKO TRIBUTE was closest in pursuit in the two path early, fell out of range in the
middle stages, chased two wide on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
ADARE MANOR stalked from inside around the clubhouse turn, roused two then three wide on the second bend, put to right handed urging, reeled in the
leader midstretch and won going away. SCYLLA bobbled leaving the gate, raced up close then went up to press the pace from outside, took over early on
the backstretch, cleared at the half-mile pole, patiently handled through the far turn, cut the corner into the lane, asked left handed in upper stretch, yielded
to ADARE MANOR midstretch and stayed on to hold second. FLYING CONNECTION settled along the rail, coaxed along on the far turn and moved over to
the two path, lacked room behind a pair of rivals and steadied at the three-sixteenths pole, altered out into the clear and outkicked DESERT DAWN for the
show honors. DESERT DAWN tracked three wide then moved into the two path around the first turn, navigated the second bend three then four wide,
finished in tandem with FLYING CONNECTION and got edged by that rival for third. PRETTY MISCHIEVOUS tracked five then four deep in the early going,
drew closer up the backstretch, asked two wide on the far turn but flattened out in the lane. SUGAR FISH chased four then three wide on the clubhouse turn
and was ridden along at the three-quarter pole, got crowded between rivals early on the backstretch, chased three deep into the second bend, five wide into
the lane and faded. COFFEE IN BED traveled between rivals or in the two path at the back, coaxed along in the middle stages, trailed into the stretch and
failed to menace. OLIVIA TWIST sprinted clear and crossed over early, pressured from outside then lost command at the nine-sixteenths pole, chased the
new leader past the half-mile marker, saved ground through the far turn on the inside and tired.

three-eighths pole, bid between a quarter mile out, took over into the lane, cleared at the eighth pole and was ridden out to the wire. NUCLEAR shifted in to
bump inner rival in the beginning, tracked three deep, three then two wide on the clubhouse turn, bumped with inner rival three deep at the three-eighths
pole, bid three deep at the quarter pole, dueled to upper stretch, then failed to match strides with the winner approaching the eighth pole and kept on to
prove second best. BIG JUANITO sat off the pace and steered to the two path, chased three then four wide on the second bend, lacked a bid in the final
furlong and managed to save the show. CLASSICALLY traveled along the inside then a bit off the rail briefly before moving back to the fence, raced near
the back into the far turn, tipped out at the quarter pole and missed third. SALTWATER COWBOY settled on the inside, drew closer on the backstretch,
ridden along between rivals on the far turn and could not summon the needed response. MYSTERIOUS HUSBAND off slow to begin, tucked inside at the
back then raced inside a rival, went between foes in the middle stages, rounded the far turn in the two path and improved placings in the stretch run.
DURAN broke a step slow, located at the rear early outside a rival, raced outside a pair of rivals on the backstretch, remained in the three path to the stretch
and failed to threaten. BUY THE RUMOR saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and was never involved. LEGITIMATE TARGET (GB) vied
three deep leaving the chute then dueled from outside, inched ahead on the backstretch, cleared at the seven-sixteenths pole, moved over to the inside,
confronted by a pair of rivals at the quarter pole, relinquished the lead into the lane and gave way. ALPHA OMEGA got bumped between rivals shortly after
the start, tracked three deep then four deep on the far turn and was never a factor. SIZE LORD bumped with ALPHA OMEGA in the beginning, vied
between rivals then dueled from inside, kept the pressure on LEGITIMATE TARGET (GB) up the backstretch, lost contact with that rival into the far turn,
gave chase around that bend and tired.
