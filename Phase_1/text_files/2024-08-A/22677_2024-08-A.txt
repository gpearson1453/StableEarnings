Footnotes
JIMMY P was carried in early, struggled jumping over fence two, was reserved off the pace while jumping well from that point through fence seven, hit fence
eight then advanced to make a bid coming to the final fence, took over going over that fence then quickly went clear, drew away on the far turn, widened into
the final furlong and proved much the best while eased up late. GOING COUNTRY (IRE) moved in early, jumped okay while tracking the pace, chased on
the final turn and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place. ABAAN was caught at the rear when the flagged drop, spotted the front several
lengths, struggled over fence one, lagged at the rear, hit fence four while struggling over that jump, settled on the outside, was roused for more on the final
turn, drifted in near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. ARTISTIC CHOICE (IRE) moved in early, jumped well
while off the pace and failed to respond then was transported off the course via equine ambulance. PICKANUMBER (IRE) went to the front, hit fence two
then stumbled upon landing, continued to show the way with a clear advantage, hit the fence eighth, lost the advantage going over fence nine and tired.
TOO FRIENDLY (GB) was off near the rear then carried in early, exchanged severe bumps with an opponent before the first fence, saved ground while
jumping well, hit fence nine then stumbled and came up empty. KIYOMORI was off near the back of the field, exchanged hard bumps with a rival while
carried in early, moved out to race widest of the bunch and faltered then was eased but walked off. ZARAK THE BRAVE (FR) hit fence two then stumbled
and fell when landing, was caught by an outrider on the backstretch then transported off the course via equine ambulance.

MIDTOWN LIGHTS established the front and showed the way rated on the pace along the inside, remained on hold taking the inside route into upper
stretch, got roused spinning to the two path straightened away, dug in under lone threat to the outside and held on to prevail. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE
coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths,
swung three wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid through to the finish but was ultimately rebuffed to the wire while well clear of the rest and along
second best. ECHO IN ETERNITY chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route
into upper stretch, weakened while along for the show honors. AMITY ISLAND chased along the inside and then just off the inside under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, spun just of the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. SARATOGA KISSES chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the
half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, tired. KRYSTALHEIR chased three to four wide coming under

Footnotes
THIRTY THOU KELVIN bumped with a rival after the start then was taken up in tight quarters between horses, raced in the three path on the first turn,
settled on the outside, moved in outside the five-eighths pole, saved ground on the far turn, was roused at the quarter-pole, rallied along the rail into the final
furlong and closed well to get up late and prevail. MIDNIGHT MILE (IRE) bumped with a foe after the start, was taken under a snug hold while tugging
keenly on the bit, saved ground under stout restraint on the first turn, continued to pull hard under restraint while just behind the leader, moved out around
the half-mile pole then made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the two path on the far turn, took the lead in the three path into upper stretch, led under a
drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while just able to get the place. WATCH THIS BIRDIE broke a bit awkwardly but right with the field, rounded the
first turn in the two path, was unhurried at the rear, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was roused near the quarter-pole then came out to the seven
path into the stretch, drifted out a bit more under a left-handed crop then was straightened by the rider, rallied outside into the final furlong, swapped back to
her inside lead while gaining just inside the sixteenth-pole and finished well to just miss while up for the show. IMMENSITUDE (FR) was taken in hand early,
rounded the first turn in the three path, was rated on the outside then carried out some near the half-mile pole, came under encouragement while three then
two wide on the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the runner-up into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked. NOT SO CLOSE moved in
while going to the front, went around the first turn in the two path, showed the way in hand, was asked while inside on the far turn, lost the advantage in the
two path into upper stretch, drifted out some outside the furlong marker, battled into the final sixteenth and weakened. BLISSFUL was hustled from the gate,
saved ground while reserved off the pace, chased on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then came under the crop, pursued the vanguard in the
drive and lacked the needed kick. STRIKINGLY SPUN bumped with foes on both sides after the start then was taken up in tight quarters, saved ground on
the first turn, shifted out outside the five-eighths pole, was roused while two then three wide on the far turn, turned five wide into the stretch, moved out
some outside the furlong marker and also lacked the needed kick.

Footnotes
AWESOME CZECH broke out at the start, tucked in before the first turn, saved ground on that bend, settled comfortably off the pace, was roused while two
then three wide on the far turn, rallied in upper stretch, closed strongly on the tiring pacesetter to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear
under good handling. BROCKNARDINI dropped back early, settled near the rear on the inside of a rival while saving ground, was urged along on the far
turn, moved out inside the three-sixteenths pole and gained willingly to just get place. MUNNY GRAB broke out at the start, angled in early, raced in the
three path on the first turn, settled towards the back, was roused in the two path on the far turn, came out into upper stretch and gained to just miss the
place while clear for the show. SUMMER WHIRL went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the back on the outside, was urged along in the three
path on the far turn, came out into the stretch, angled out inside the furlong marker and improved position. RED BURGUNDY veered out and brushed the
gate but came out in front, moved in while going clear, went around the first turn in the two path, showed the way with a clear advantage, extended the
advantage along the rail on the far turn, shortened stride under the crop in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and gave way.
BOXED WINE brushed with a rival at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged along with a half-mile to run, saved
ground while ridden along on the far turn, came out into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. DOWNTOWN CHANNEL broke through the front of
the gate prior to the start but remained in the stall, was backed out then reloaded, went around most of the first turn in the two path then shifted to the three
path, tracked the leader down the backstretch, chased inside on the far turn and came up empty. BOSSY JEANS was taken in hand early, raced in the three
path for most of the first turn then moved to the four path, was forwardly placed on the outside, passed the half-mile pole under urging, traveled around the
far turn in the two path, lugged in some in upper stretch and capitulated.

BACKED BY GOLD established position just off the pace, made a bid between horses near the nine-sixteenths, vied in the three path on the turn, took a
short lead in upper stretch, battled inside of runner-up into the final sixteenth then moved clear under strong urging. MON PETIT CHOU broke out and hit
the gate then was hustled, chased the pace on the outside, moved closer while six then five wide on the turn, gained to make a bid at the quarter-pole,
fought outside of the winner into the final sixteenth and was oufinished while just able to get the place. AWESOME ANNMARIE was restless in the gate,
raced off the pace under urging, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to just miss the place while
narrowly up for the show. CONDIMENT GIRL was well placed just off the pace on the inside, saved ground on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch,
chased the leader in the drive and finished willingly but just missed the trifecta. GHOSTLY GIRL chased the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped from five
wide to three wide early on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick. PERPETUAL PRAISE was rated just off the pace,
raced in hand while behind horses late on the backstretch, drafted in the two path on the turn, was given her cue late on that bend, shifted three wide into
the stretch then moved further out and also lacked the needed kick. FONTANAFREDDA stumbled in the hindquarters and tossed her head at the start, was
off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and lacked the needed response. R FUNNY
BIZNESS was hard ridden at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed response.
EVERLYS GIRL went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way.
VIOLENT VIXEN was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn and tired. WILLFUL DESIRE was urged along
towards the back, went around the turn in the three path, turned into the stretch in the four path and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DESTINY STAR broke in at the start bumping and squeezing back BEETS in tandem with MISS SAN GABRIEL, tracked the front just off the pace two then
three wide, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied with good energy to collar the once
clear leader a sixteenth out, dug in and edged away to the finish to prevail. COLLABORATION got pinched back after the start when rivals on both sides
closed down her lane and grew rank after the move which in turn forced REVALITA to get taken hold of in behind her seven furlongs from home, settled
once in the turn along the inside, tipped to track the front from the two path down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, tipped three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors in the late stages. REVALITA (FR) broke a half a
beat slow and got bumped at the start by BON ADIEU, then lost her lane to that rival, raced near the rear of the field and grew rank when taken hold of
behind the aforementioned foe seven furlongs from home, stargazed a bit through the first turn, then settled to chase three then two wide down the
backstretch and through the far turn patiently handled until let out swinging four wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to procure the show honors.
MISS SAN GABRIEL broke out at the start bumping and squeezing back BEETS in concert with DESTONY STAR, established the front and showed the
way in hand along the inside through sensible splits on hold until let out taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under lone threat and
was caught a sixteenth from home, kept on to the finish. ZIAERATI coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, improved position when offering up a mild bid. BON ADIEU broke in at the start bumping
REVALITA and then taking over her lane, came inwards and then outwards and also pinched back COLLABORATION after the start against pressure
outside, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. BEETS got
bumped between foes who each broke her way and was squeezed back at the start, chased along the inside through the first turn and then three wide
thereafter, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just of the inside at the head of the stretch and weakened. PRELIMINARY (GB) pulled keenly
four then three wide through the first turn to take brief command into the backstretch, came under a hold accompanying MISS SAN GABRIEL to the outside
in the two path and was patiently handled until placed to coaxing inside the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. CENTURIA
(IRE) coaxed from the gate, raced three wide throughout, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, tipped four wide at the top of the stretch, tired in the
drive. CURLIN'S GIRL chased three wide throughout under urging from the five-sixteenths and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
FINAL VERDICT pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, took the lead in upper stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker and
held under steady urging. GASLIGHT DANCER settled towards the rear under some urging, went around the turn in the two then three path, came out to
the seven path into upper stretch, found his best stride in the final furlong and finished fast to just get the place. HILARIOUS AFFAIR steadied off heels near
the five-eighths pole, settled towards the rear, went around the turn in the three path, came out to the six path into upper stretch and finished with good
energy to just miss the place while clear for the show. FEATHERS ROAD was forwardly placed on the outside, raced in the two path while asked on the
turn, spun three wide into the stretch, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. JAVA BUZZ was hustled to the front, set the
pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail under extra left-rein pressure on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch, battled
with that foe into the final furlong and tired. BORLETTI (IRE) was well placed in the second flight, chased inside on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two
path then moved out some, chased into the final furlong and also tired. KING MOONRACER was restless in the gate, dropped back after the start then
came under urging, went around the turn in the two path, came four wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. TYPHOON FURY dropped back early then
was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came under the crop in upper stretch, lacked room behind tired foes late and failed to threaten.
