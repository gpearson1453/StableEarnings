Footnotes
ELECTROSTATIC sprinted away from the field bearing out, angled in into the second turn, holding the advantage, then lasted under steady pressure.
PARTNER TOURS tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain and
missed. DARK SIDE (IRE) mid pack, looped up two and three wide through the second turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and closed well for the show.
CITY LEADER well placed, gained a striking position two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and flattened
out. GOLDEN OAK ran evenly, inside. SHIMMERING LEROID was no factor. EIGHT WEEKS LONG was never involved.
