OUR HEAVENLY GIFT hopped at the start and came away last then steadied entering the first turn, rated just off the early pace, remained patiently handled
around the far turn, launched a bid three wide heading into the lane, responded under right handed pressure and drew clear. DARYL'S BOLT stalked three
wide up the backstretch, hustled along two path around the far turn, sustained bid into the lane, put a head in front near the sixteenth pole then got
overtaken by the winner. EZ FITZ vied for the lead late on the first turn and continued to match strides up the backstretch, shook free and held clear around
the far turn, continued to lead the way into the final furlong then got outfinished. KHOZANTHEDESTROYER was allowed to settle through early stages,
hustled along three to four wide near the quarter pole and had no response. GO FOR IT vied for the lead late on the first turn, continued to duel up the
backstretch, could not move on with the leader entering the far turn and faded through the lane.

THAT'S OUR VISION was slightly bumped at the start and settled off the early pace, continued unhurried into the turn, picked up the tempo near the quarter
pole, shifted to the five path at the head of the lane, responded willingly when called upon, rallied along the outside and finished going away. CUPIDS
SWEETY was forwardly placed in opening stages then edged up to challenge CONFETTI BETTY for the lead, battled outside of rival into the final furlong,
shook free to a brief lead then got overtaken by the winner. CONFETTI BETTY vied for the early lead, battled on racing inside of CUPIDS SWEETY into the
final furlong then weakened late. SWEET STROLL raced in early contention, made a move mid-way around the turn and raced three wide in aim for the lead
at the quarter pole, ran on to the furlong marker then flattened out. SING LUCY SING was never too far back in early stages, chased three wide around the
turn, ran on four paths wide in upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. RISKY WHISKY vied for the early lead, failed to match strides leaving the
backstretch, chased in contention around the turn then weakened in the lane. KID BIZ raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide for
then drive and failed to kick on.

under firm handling and gained second best. SIMMERING stalked the pace up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid around the final turn, sustained
bid into the lane and cleared a share. KASA vied for the lead around the first turn, remained forwardly placed sitting just off the leader up the backstretch,
vied outside of ELLE E around the far turn, could not match strides with eventual winner at the head of the lane and steadily weakened. HOP AWAY
