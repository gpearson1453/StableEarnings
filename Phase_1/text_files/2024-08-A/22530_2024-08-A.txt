Footnotes
SIGNATURE RING set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew clear. SHES HOT TO TROT was
in touch, had a mild gain on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. FREED BY MAGIC was well back, closed the gap on the
turn, angled out through the stretch and was up for show. GOLDEN SPRING forced the early pace and dueled on the turn but from the four path at the top
of the stretch had nothing left. SOUL JOURNEY was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no threat.
SUGAR DROP was in range and roused from the inside on the turn but had no response. GOINGTOARUBA settled off the early leaders and had a good
position on the turn but failed to fire.

Footnotes
MIA AND ME was in touch, raced evenly from the inside on the turn, lacked room in upper stretch and got up in time. BACK TO REALITY showed speed
from the outside, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY was
unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch just missed. BUSTA GROOVE was in range and roused on the
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. SPIRIT OF SEATTLE forced the early pace and was a factor on the turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch faded. FAJARDO broke poorly, was pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
FOLLOW ME HOME set the pace, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. COLLABORATIVE was
unhurried early and moved up on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. MISS D'S PRIDE stalked the early
leader and was a factor on the turn but had no late kick. BUTWAITTHERE'SMORE was in touch and hustled along on the turn but from the three path at the
top of the stretch was not a factor. HARPER CITY was in range but chased on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch had no impact.
HOLIDAY IN CHILE was well back, showed nothing and was never in contention.

BRADY O'BRADY was unhurried early, gained ground on the turn, had a bid at the top of the stretch and drew off. BOXER BRIEF tracked the early leaders
from the outside, raced evenly on the turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch was up for place. IT'S GAME KNIGHT was in touch and roused
on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch needed more. BEND IN THE RIVER was in range and had a mild gain on the turn but from the
six path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. EQUAL JUSTICE was hustled early and forced the pace on the turn but from the five path at the top of
the stretch had nothing left. ANARCHY showed speed from the inside and had a slim lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was
empty.

Footnotes
JIMMY IS A BREEZE was in touch, took command on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held sway. PRINCESS BU CHERRO was off
the pace, moved up on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. GHOSTLY PERFECTION was unhurried early and
hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. SMOKEN CHLOE was hustled early and had a good position on the
turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. AMONG THE ROSES settled off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and was not a
factor. KNOTTY AND NICE set the pace but lost ground on the turn and was empty.
