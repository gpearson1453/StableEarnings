TWO JET hustled to the lead from two wide through the turn then pulled away in upper stretch and held on. COMMUNICATIONISKEY broke inward then
hustled along to press the pace from the three path, fell back slightly into the stretch but dug in to make the late gain on the winner. SEE SASSY RUN saved
ground while racing off the pace giving an even effort. BET ON BOURBON trailed the field early then moved up from three wide on the turn, tipping out to
four wide in upper stretch but faltered. D'WILD MUFFIN raced wide throughout and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ONLY A DREAM shared the command from two wide through the turn then inched away in upper stretch and drew clear to prove best. COACH SAM P
chased the leaders through the turn, moved out to three wide in upper stretch to make a late run to be second best. GET RIPPED shared the command
from the inside to upper stretch and weakened. LEXINGTON RIVER raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground, made a mild rail bid on the turn to
be best of the rest. UNAFFILIATED raced near the back into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. SUPERHERO broke in and bumped with COACH SAM P
leaving the gate then raced in the middle of the pack in the early stages and retreated. JUSTINS SECRET trailed the field early then made a rail bid going
into the turn, tipped out to two wide around the turn but lacked the late response. WAABOO broke inward leaving the gate then raced wide through the turn,
tipped towards the rail in the stretch but was not a threat.

Footnotes
YOU VEE CEE roused towards the front to press the pace from two wide down the backstretch then matched strides with CAMPISI through the turn, inched
away in upper stretch then drew clear in mid stretch to prove best. RIFEY was unhurried early while saving ground on the backstretch angled out on the turn
to go three wide at the quarter pole, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch and made the strong late rally. INVARIABLY raced in the middle of the pack
while saving ground around the turn, moved between horses at the sixteenth pole for the late effort to be up for the show. FIFTEEN LOVE BACK was
allowed to settle down the backstretch then moved up from four wide on the turn, showed late interest to improve position. J B GRAY hustled along and vied
for the lead from three wide around the turn but gave way in the stretch. CAMPISI went to a clear early lead then was headed past the half mile marker and
match strides inside of YOU VEE CEE and J B GRAY around the turn and tired. TWITTY CITY chased the leaders from mid pack to the quarter pole then
dropped back.

Footnotes
GRAND ENCORE raced off the pace down the backstretch then moved up to challenge for the lead going three wide into the final turn, engaged the leader
at the quarter pole then drew clear and held on. CATHY'S BOY raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then steadily advanced on the
backstretch, steadied slightly going into the final turn, moved out to three wide in upper stretch for the late rally. WHISKEY WITH YOU rushed up to press
the pace from two wide around the first turn then took the lead midway down the backstretch, drew clear into the final turn but was headed at the quarter
pole and gave way grudgingly. TIGER MAN MCKOOL raced in the middle of the pack from four wide around the first turn then moved up from the inside
down the backstretch, tipped out to two wide around the final turn but flattened out. SWEET PRESENT was allowed to settle while saving ground down the
backstretch, made a four wide bid on the final turn, tipped out to five wide in upper stretch but finished evenly. PEARSE raced in the middle of the pack from
three wide on the first turn then moved up to contention from four wide around the final turn but weakened. TAP TO CONNECT broke well to go to the front
showing the good early speed while being under pressure to midway down the backstretch then faded. LITTLE BISCUITS was void of the early speed and
trailed the field through the turn and passed tiring rivals. MUCHO MACHO CAM raced in the middle of the pace from the two path then steadily faded. THE
JOCKEY OF CATHY'S BOY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF GRAND ENCORE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE GOING INTO THE FINAL
TURN, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

TRABR'S CREED hopped slightly at the start then rushed up the rail to take the lead at the seven sixteenth and drew clear on the turn, kept to task in the
drive. OVER PAID showed good early speed away from the gate, vied for the lead from two wide around the turn but fell back slightly entering the stretch
but kept on to be second best. PRIX DE WEST raced in the middle of the pack early then moved between horses at the five sixteenth and kept on for the
late gain for second. NEVER OVER ME raced in the middle of the pack on the inside but flattened out. COME ON COME ON was six wide early then tipped
in to go three wide around the turn and made a late run to improve position. COUNTRY CAT JAKE chased the leaders from three wide around the turn and
faded. ALL SAINTS saved ground to no avail. JUST HANGIN RIDGE remained back.
