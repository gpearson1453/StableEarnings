Footnotes
GRINNING led in the early going, rated close up, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, shook
clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. MAHJONG GIRL sprinted to a clear lead off the rail through the first turn, angled in and held command to the
second turn, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then could not threaten the winner, while clearly best of the rest. LITTLE MISS MUNNY allowed to
settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, angled four wide into the stretch and closed well for the show. BIANCA well placed and outside,
gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened. BANANA PUDDING was never involved.
BLAME THE WARRIOR broke sharply from the gate and was rated back, then faded through the second turn.

Footnotes
RED PIXIE well placed and between, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, angled four wide into the stretch, shook clear, then
drew off and was kept to the task. BOURBON BLAST tracked the pace back, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the
stretch, angled in for clear racing room, made a steady gain and edged up for the place. LET'S BE HONEST led in the early going, rated outside, moved up
to gain a short lead down the backstretch, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then drifted in and weakened late. PRETTY FLATTERING broke a
step slowly from the gate, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up for a share. SEIVER passed
tiring rivals. SHORESY well placed and outside, faded through the second turn. SONET'S NAME pulled to contention through the first turn, set the pace
inside, stayed on when challenged down the backstretch, then weakened in the lane.

weakened the final furong. CAMINO DE SANTIAGO passed a tiring rival. TIZ LUCKY set the early pace off the rail, stalked the leader down the backstretch,

safe. HE'S A GOOD DANCER allowed to settle, looped four and five wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed
the place. TONY SMALL unhurried, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, drifted out slightly, then drifted in
while gaining under right hand urging and edged up for a share. COLONEL POPPY mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch and evened out. CITY TRIPPER rated close inside, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then faded the final

the place. UP FOR IT tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, evened and held the show. I'M
HEADING EAST unhurried, saved ground through the turn, angled three and four wide into the stretch then passed tiring rivals for a share. INSCRUTABLE

Footnotes
SEDUCTIVE (IRE) mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turns, gaining position through the second turn, angled four wide into the stretch, made a
steady gain and drove clear late. PROTECTTHEWITNESS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway unchallenged to the final yards, then was
no match for the winner and held the place safe. LA PANDA tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the
stretch, then made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. ALL BIZZ allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came
through on that path, angled in, steadied for racing room, then angled out made a steady gain and got up for a share. WILD LOOKER mid pack, gained
position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. TIZ PROMISING RVF passed tiring rivals.
LIGHTNING ROUND ran evenly for a half and faded. SCOOP THERE IT IS well placed, faded through the second turn.
