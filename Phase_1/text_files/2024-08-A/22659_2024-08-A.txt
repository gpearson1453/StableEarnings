Footnotes
FASTNFURIOUS was rated on the front end, let out on the turn, lengthened command under urging in the lane and allowed to coast the final fifty yards.
SWISS GUARD was checked behind traffic leaving the cute, settled outside, came widest into the lane, moved clear for second inside the last eighth and
could only hold his position late. COMFORT ME NOW chased from inside, lodged a mild bid along the rail into the lane then leveled off deep stretch. JACK
VAN BERG pressed just outside FASTNFURIOUS on the backstretch, could not stay with that one on the bend then gave way between rivals through the
stretch.

Footnotes
VALIANTLY DISCREET was hustled to a clear early lead, just off the inside taking the bend, dug in under urging the last furlong and kept ONE PUTT
RICHIE at bay. ONE PUTT RICHIE forwardly placed from inside, went for the lead along the rail in the stretch, loomed a serious threat inside the last
furlong, lacked the needed late kick but was clearly second best. WILLOW RIDGE unruly in the gate, was away slowly, just off the rail on the turn, lodged a
mild bid between rivals and gained third late. MOCOWBELL in contention early toward the outside, began to fade four wide on the bend and could only
make up minor ground deep stretch outside horses. MADE TO FIT failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. INSIDE THE CIRCLE pressed the leader from
outside, was three wide taking the turn then gave way between rivals for the drive.

inside the final furlong. MISS TENA MARIE without early speed from outside, was widest taking the turn, drifted out some upper stretch, was corrected,
rallied belatedly but caught LUCKSME for second. LUCKSME broke on top, set a pressured pace off the rail but inside ELENA MAE, gradually wore down
for the drive and was drifting out through the waning yards. MISS DUTTON in contention toward the outside, retreated just off the rail through the turn,
fanned out some for the stretch run, regained a striking a striking position, leveled off in the late going and was steadied behind LUCKSME nearing the wire.

HER NAME WAS LOLA was kept close behind rivals, two wide on the bend, angled out 6 wide at the top of the stretch, was all out and got up in time under
a well-judged ride. HIGHTAILING IT vied for the lead between horses from the beginning, came four wide into the lane, edged ahead inside the final furlong
but was outfinished in a game effort. BLAZE BEAUTY contested the pace from outside, was widest through the turn then lacked the extra needed deep
stretch. TILL disputed the pace from inside but slowly wore down inside the last eighth. COLLECT A LIL a step slow at the start, moved to the inside early
on, waited for room on the turn, was steadied behind TILL nearing the quarter pole, got through along the rail leaving the bend, had every chance but
weakened in the late going. MOONSHINE MOLLY displayed early speed between rivals but gave way three wide in the lane.

Footnotes
MYSTIC POWER bumped GUN IT AND RUN IT leaving the chute, gradually angled in as he advanced from outside, led two wide into the turn, was
challenged from both sides after entering the last furlong, fought on even terms inside DIAMONDONICE in the late going but edged ahead in time.
DIAMONDONICE soon found himself boxed in on the backstretch, gained a clear path three wide into the bend, engaged MYSTIC POWER inside the final
eighth, battled on even terms but had to settle for second best nearing the wire. TIZWOW took the lead from inside after the first sixteenth, was challenged
nearing the end of a quarter mile, saved ground through the turn, still threatened along the rail after entering the last eighth but began to wear down
approaching the final sixteenth. GUN IT AND RUN IT was bumped and forced into MR. CHIVAS leaving the chute, raced in contention toward the outside,
was steadied in close quarters when MYSTIC POWER took his path midway on the backstretch, lost ground four then five wide through the bend then could
only improve position some late without threatening. WICKED GUS failed to menace in a wide trip. CHARLIE'S BEACH broke alertly, was soon chasing
TIZWOW in tight quarters between rivals, came into the stretch from path four and flattened out the final furlong. NATIONS DREAM chased from inside and
was not a factor. MR. CHIVAS bumped leaving the chute, showed no early speed while between horses, was just off the rail taking the bend then had no
late bid.

DEVIL'S TOWER pressed the early speed from outside, took the lead two wide on the bend, began to float out some as he moved clear upper stretch,
began to drift out badly under left-handed pressure with a furlong to go, was challenged from outside after entering the the last eighth, continued to drift out
and drew off the final sixteenth. W W HOTSHOT broke on top but was soon chasing FAST JACK, gradually angled in to keep a clear path inside that one,
came off the rail when his path was taken nearing the end of two furlongs, angled out three wide on the turn, floated out further into the stretch, threatened
DEVIL'S TOWER from outside after entering the final eighth, was checked solidly when the latter came into his path nearing the sixteenth pole, altered in
and lost all chance. FAST JACK gradually angled in as he vied for the early lead, moved clear after the first eighth, was challenged from outside
approaching the half mile pole, overtaken on the turn and gave way the final furlong. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE moved to the rail for a clear path early on,
was checked off W W HOTSHOT'S heels shortly after travelling the first eighth, altered out then began to fade with three furlongs to go. The rider of
KHOZAN'S VALENTINE lodged an objection claiming interference from W W HOTSHOT early on the backstretch. The rider of W W HOTSHOT lodged an
objection claiming interference from DEVIL'S TOWER nearing the final sixteenth. After their review, the stewards upheld both objections, KHOZAN'S
VALENTINE was placed in front of W W HOTSHOT and DEVIL'S TOWER was placed behind W W HOTSHOT. Initially 2-1-3-5 was made the official order
of finish. After some time passed the order of finish was corrected to be 5-2-1-3 and made official. All pari-mutuel tickets that have either of the orders of
finish will be paid. Due to a timer malfunction, the first quarter mile fraction was hand timed.

Footnotes
MAMBA OUT soon had the lead and sprinted away from the rest, was roused with two furlongs to go, floated out entering the lane, drifted out inside the last
eighth but proved clearly the best. GHAALEB'S CITY unruly in the gate, jerked her head back to center when the gate opened, lost ground five wide through
the turn, moved clear for second upper stretch then could only maintain her position late. GHALY POSSE soon trailed, lost considerable ground widest
through the bend but passed outside weakening rivals through the stretch. JULYNNE hesitated at the break, gradually angled in while being hustled along,
gained a striking position three wide on the turn, swung out some for the stretch run and leveled off. LIFE OF SATURDAYS raced closest to MAMBA OUT
for a half mile then weakened two wide in the lane. CANTOO hesitated then swiped the gate on her leaving and failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.
VIVA VIOLENCE very fractious in the gate, was taken out, examined and okayed to run by the veterinarian, broke alertly, was soon overtaken then
gradually faded while toward the outside.
