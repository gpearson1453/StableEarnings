Footnotes
REACH FOR THE ROSE coaxed from the gate, prompted the leader from the outside three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took
over three wide at the quarter pole, drew clear under a drive shying out from a left handed crop at the three-sixteenths and then in from a right handed crop
a furlong out before shying back out under a left handed crop a sixteenth out and switched to the wrong lead late while kept to task to the finish.
INSUBORDINATION (IRE) broke in at the start and was corrected, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide
into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. DEW coaxed from from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, yielded the front and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. ASSERTIVENESS brushed the near side stall at
the start and came under brief coaxing, chased three to four wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, folded,
and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
SMILENSAYCHEESE showed speed and set the pace while off the pace, lugged out in the three path under extra left-rein pressure on the turn, lost the
advantage outside the five-sixteenths pole, regained the lead in upper stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker and drew away under strong urging.
THE TONER lunged at the start and was off a step slow, moved in then chased the pace, gained along the rail on the turn, took the lead outside the
five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage back to the winner in upper stretch and proved no match while well clear for the place. CORVUS was bumped at the
start, raced towards the back under urging while between foes, jostled with a rival late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, bumped with another
opponent at the quarter-pole, came between horses into the final furlong and was along for the show. KING'S LEAP was fractious in the gate, veered and hit
the gate lightly then bumped with a foe, was urged along between horses, jostled with a rival late on the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn,
was driven into upper stretch in the seven path and lacked the needed kick. PROBABILITY chased the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in
the three path and tired. TWELVE NELSON was hustled from the gate then hard ridden at the rear, angled from the two path to the four path on the turn,
came out into the nine path into upper stretch and was no factor. SPIRIT OF THE LAW was hustled from the gate then chased the pace, went four wide on
the turn, came in a bit and bumped with an opponent at the quarter-pole then had nothing left. FRIEND OFTHE DEVIL was bumped at the start and forced
into another foe then pinched back, moved out then advanced on the outside under urging, made a bid late on the backstretch, vied in the five path on the
turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faded. KILLYBEGS KID brushed with a rival at the start, was urged along between foes, saved ground on the turn
and faltered. BUT NOW AM FOUND brushed with a foe at the start then was hustled, chased the pace on the outside, made a bid with a half-mile to run,
vied in the four path on the turn, dropped back late on that bend then spun into the stretch in the five path and retreated.

clear to the finish. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three wide

CALL HER BLUFF went around the first turn in the five path, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the far turn then driven into the stretch in the
five path, brushed with a foe near the three-sixteenths pole, chased outside into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and got up to win going
away. SILENT MELODY rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused in the two then three path on the far turn, turned into the
stretch in the four path, brushed with a foe inside the three-sixteenths pole, chased into the final furlong, gained on the leader into the final sixteenth and
willingly earned the place while unable to match strides with the winner late. ELLIPTIC bumped solidly with a foe at the start, raced in the three path on the
first turn, settled towards the rear, was asked while inside to the two path on the far turn, shifted to the three path into the stretch, brushed with an opponent
inside the three-sixteenths pole, chased into the final furlong, gained on the leader into the final sixteenth, vied between horses late and finished willingly to
just miss the place while able to get the show. SHE TAKES CASH was hustled from the gate, raced in the three path on the first turn, prompted the pace on
the outside, was asked leaving the backstretch, took the lead in the three path outside the three-eighths pole then moved clear, dropped to the two path late
on the turn, came under the crop in upper stretch, remained in front while shortening stride into the final sixteenth and was overtaken. BARONESS
BOURBON bumped solidly with an opponent at the start, dropped from the four path to the rail on the first turn, settled off the inside on the backstretch, was
urged four then five wide on the far turn then driven six wide into the stretch, brushed with a foe around the three-sixteenths pole and lacked the needed
response. DUSK was hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside, lost the lead outside the three-eighths pole, chased into the stretch and tired. MIM
broke out and brushed the gate lightly, rounded the first turn in the four path, tracked the pace on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch,
dropped back four wide on the far turn and faltered.

UNCAGED coaxed from the gate, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths and angled out six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the sixteenth pole, edged away to the finish kept to task. SEA
VISTA broke in at the start and was corrected, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then tucked into the turn briefly to the two
path before angling out three wide to move around CLASSICIST and bumped with I GOT GAME near the three-eighths under coaxing, angled out seven
wide into upper stretch carrying out and brushing that same rival and then tipped out and bumped I GOT GAME once more at the three-sixteenths, offered
up a mild kick to secure the place honors. CLASSICIST lunged at the break and conceded three to four lengths to the front before being able to settle into
stride, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and improved position running on to
the finish. C K WONDER struck the near side stall at the start and came under coaxing to range up and take over command soon after, showed the way in
hand just off the inside under pressure from SHOT IN THE DARK and CYCLONE STATE to the outside, tucked inside through the turn and came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got headed at the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch taking back narrow command, dug in under
threat and was headed a furlong out, then got on even terms briefly before being displaced in tandem with CYCLONE STATE nearing the sixteenth pole and
weakened in the late stages. I GOT GAME lost his rear footing at the start and got away last conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased briefly five
to six wide and climbed facing kickback and was tipped out one additional path and into clearance, tucked four wide into the turn and went briefly three wide
before being carried back out four wide and bumped by SEA VISTA with three furlongs to go, rallied in tandem with that rival and was brushed and carried
out eight wide into upper stretch and then bumped at the three-sixteenths, then passed tired rivals to the finish. CYCLONE STATE tossed his head and was
away to an awkward start but only conceded a length to the front, prompted the pace outside the top pair six paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and took very
narrow command a furlong out, then was on even terms with C K WONDER and was overtaken for the front by the eventual winner near the sixteenth
marker and weakened in the late going. SHOT IN THE DARK coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace four and then two wide between foes coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, took over narrow command swinging three wide at the quarter pole, got headed for the front straightened away into upper
stretch and weakened through to the finish. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the turn focusing on SEA VISTA and I GOT GAME. After review, the result
was allowed to stand before the race was declared official.

FEROCIOUS was moving around in the gate and broke a bit slow, moved up under urging then was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn,
was asked near the five-sixteenths pole, shifted to the three path at the quarter-pole, made a bid outside the pacesetter in upper stretch, took the advantage
nearing the furlong marker and powered away under steady urging to prove much the best. EL PRESTIGIO went to the front, showed the way with a clear
advantage, went around the turn in the two path, was roused into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner coming to the furlong marker and proved
no match while just able to get the place. PRAETOR bumped with a rival while off a step slow then was pinched back, spotted the front several lengths,
raced at the rear under urging, went three wide for most of the turn, angled five wide while gaining late on that bend, pursued the winner under a drive into
the final furlong and just missed the place while well clear for the show. CONTRABANDIST broke out and bumped with a foe, was urged along off the pace,
went around the turn in the two path and came up empty. ANTIETAM broke out at the start, was ridden along towards the rear, dropped from the two path to
the rail briefly midway through the turn then came back off the inside, shifted three then four wide while getting closer late on that bend, spun five wide into
the stretch then moved out and failed to threaten. RIPPED was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and
capitulated. DISCREET DANCER was urged along near the back, tossed his head and steadied late on the backstretch, raced inside to the two path on the
turn, spun three wide into the stretch then moved further out and was no factor. MATH TUTOR came outward at the start, was urged along on the outside,
moved from the four path to the six path on the turn, chased into the stretch and had nothing left. LOUGH CURRANE bumped with a foe at the start, chased
the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, dropped back under the crop into the stretch and retreated.

WAYS AND MEANS was away alertly and showed in front for the opening furlong, gave up the lead near the eleven-sixteenths then pressed on the outside,
turned up the pressure in the three path on the turn, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, kicked clear when set down in upper stretch, was put to a
left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, was given one last light pop of the crop outside the sixteenth-pole then placed under a strong-hand ride to the
finish while best. EMERY broke out then was corrected by the rider, moved up to get the lead near the eleven-sixteenths pole, showed the way under
pressure from the winner to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole, moved out under a drive in upper
stretch, kept on in the final furlong and willingly earned the place while unable to go with the winner. MY MANE SQUEEZE tracked then chased the pace on
the outside, pursued the top two in the four path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the five path while under the crop and weakened. DENIM AND
PEARLS was carried out at the start then brushed with a foe, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the three
path, moved out then drifted out near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. BELLE'S BLUE BELL broke a half-step slow and brushed with a
foe then dropped back, settled at the rear, was roused in the four path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the five path and faltered.

three wide straightened away into upper stretch roused, drew off under a drive to inside the eighth pole, held well and clear kept to task to the finish. CRUPI

near the rear of the field, got coaxed along with three furlongs remaining, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the
finish. SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING got bumped at the start by BRIGHT FUTURE, who broke outwards, and broke on top despite it, showed the way crossing
to the inside and was displaced by the top one into the first turn, allowed that rival to clear and then tipped out to be three wide down the backstretch in
closest aim and to his outside, tucked to the two path five furlongs out and remained on hold until placed to coaxing to up the pressure with seven-sixteenths
to go, spun two to three wide into upper stretch giving chase and remained prominent to the eighth pole, then weakened in the final furlong. NATIONAL

came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. FIRST MISSION broke in at the start bumping
WARRIOR JOHNY and pinching that foe back against NATIONAL TREASURE, raced just off the inside through the first turn, chased three then two wide
from just off the pace, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining and swung three wide into upper stretch, then weakened through to the finish.

Footnotes
ST. BENEDICTS PREP was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive, gained to take the lead just inside the furlong maker, battled with the runner-up late and prevailed under strong urging. ZADORSKY brushed with a
foe at the start, was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths pole, moved out behind the leaders in upper
stretch, altered back in behind those horses outside the furlong marker, gained to make a bid in the final sixteenth but missed while clear for the place.
STRIKER HAS DIAL broke out and brushed with a rival then was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the
turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths pole, lost
the advantage just inside the furlong marker and weakened late while able to get the show. MISS ENCHANTED broke out at the start, dropped off the pace
under some urging, moved out around the nine-sixteenths pole, went around the turn in the four path, turned into the stretch in the five path and lacked the
needed response. AUDACIOUS pressed then chased the pace, went around the turn in the three path, pursued the leader under a drive into the final
furlong, moved out whle dropping back shortly thereafter and tired. BON ADIEU settled towards the rear, saved ground under urging on the turn, turned into
the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. NIKITIS settled on the outside under coaxing, came under stronger encouragement in the three path on
the turn, spun into the stretch in the four path and was no factor. SHE PROSPERS bobbled at the start then brushed with opponents, was urged along at
the rear, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
PHILEAS FOGG established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper
stretch, drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well and clear to the finish. CAPTURE THE FLAG coaxed from the gate, chased just off
the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, tipped two then three wide through the latter portion of the turn before
heading four wide into upper stretch, then ran on to chase the winner home clear for the place honors. CYBER NINJA broke in at the start, chased along the
inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show
honors. MAGICAL WAYS broke in striking the near side stall at the start and bobbling momentarily rocking the rider in the saddle but conceded only two
lengths to the front, chased three wide through the first turn and then three to four wide thereafter coming under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to run,
angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. BLACK POWDER broke in at the start, raced three wide through the first turn, chased three to four
wide until tucked to the two path half a mile from home placed to coaxing, swung two to three wide at the top of the stretch and came up empty. DRAKE'S
PASSAGE forwardly placed from the start, got marooned four wide through the first turn when MAGICAL WAYS opted to stay three wide to his inside,
chased four then three wide down the backstretch, tucked inside into the far turn and came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cornered two to three
wide into upper stretch and made no impact when offering little.
