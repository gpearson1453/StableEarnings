Footnotes
MANHATTAN TWIST came out a bit while bumped at the start then was force out, angled in while showing speed, set the pace on the outside of a rival,
moved clear leaving the backstretch, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the turn, responded well when asked nearing the quarter-pole,
drifted out under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a right-handed crop inside the furlong marker and held under steady urging. MAN OF
MISCHIEF veered out at the start and bumped with a foe, pressed the pace on the inside of the winner, dropped back late on the backstretch, chased inside
for most of the turn then shifted to the three path, pursued the winner into upper stretch then was carried out some, altered in while off the heels of that foe
near the furlong marker and willingly earned the place. KEEPINITREAL was fanned out at the start, raced on the outside under urging, went around the turn
in the three then four path, turned into upper stretch in the five path, pursued the top two in the drive and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show.
ROCK STAR REBEL bobbled at the start then was bumped between foes and taken up while pinched back, angled in while off the pace, reached the rail
near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed response. GAMEBRED was bumped at the start then taken up while squeezed
back, raced towards the rear on the outside under urging, traveled around the turn in the three path, turned into the stretch in the four path and was no
factor. OZZY climbed some inside the three-quarter pole, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten.
FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF MAN OF MISCHIEF CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NEAR THE
EIGHTH-POLE. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
SCUTTLEBUZZ chased along the inside until tipped to the two path placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch,
closed well and was up in the final forty yards to the finish loosely between foes to prevail. CHESS MASTER prompted the pace of THREE ZERO from the
outside in the two path, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was
caught in the final forty yards to the finish. HIGH FRONT a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, brushed the near side stall at the start, chased four then
three wide before briefly tucking to the two path and then along the inside into the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was set down angled
five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. RITHM NIC chased two to three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, went six wide into
upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. THREE ZERO coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure
from CHESS MASTER to the outside, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in and was collared nearing the eighth pole, then weakened
through to the finish. NOLO CONTESTO crossed to the two path after the start and chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch, offered no response. HE'S GOT IT a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased three
then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. ME 'N SAP tossed his head just as the latch
was sprung and got away awkwardly and last and conceded four lengths to the front, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. HEAVEN STREET chased two to three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole before being
let out swinging four wide into upper stretch, tired in the drive and had the rider lose the handle on the crop from his right hand just before crossing the finish
line.

three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. WINTER'S GHOST brushed the off side stall at the start, vied four then three wide
between foes before tucking to the two path into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths in the midst of being shaken off, faded through the
latter portion of the turn and swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
VERY STORMY was urged along off the pace, brushed with a rival leaving the backstretch, chased four wide on the turn, pursued the runner-up under a
drive into the final sixteenth and got up under strong handling to prevail. CALL BOB pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three path outside
the three-eighths pole, was asked for his best in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to get the place. SORORITY PRANK
showed speed then chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch, kept on in the final furlong and willingly earned the
show. CONCORDE SPIRIT dropped back while urged along, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, dropped in some near the
sixteenth-pole and improved position. HE HAS IT ALL was restless in the gate, showed early speed then set the pace under pressure to his outside, lost the
lead while along the rail outside the three-eighths pole, had the rider lose her crop while dropping back in upper stretch and tired. BIG RICH broke a step
slow, moved out then was urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, came out into upper stretch and failed to rally. MIDNIGHT LEGEND
leaned out then brushed the gate and was off slow, settled at the rear, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the six
path and was no factor. ROMANTIC CHARMER broke a half-step slow then dropped back, moved up while racing high-headed, brushed with a foe leaving
the backstretch, went three wide early on the turn, floated five wide behind horses inside the three-eighths pole and faltered.

Footnotes
COOKE CREEK broke out at the start brushing the off side stall and then bumping NIMITZ CLASS in tandem with TABEGUACHE, established the front and
raced three then two wide through the first turn before showing the way in hand just off the inside down the backstretch, came under some pressure from
the runner up to the outside and slid three wide through the far turn carrying that foe four wide, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, dug in under threat to the eighth pole, then edged away to the finish kept to task. TABEGUACHE broke in at the start bumping NIMITZ
CLASS in tandem with COOKE CREEK, raced four then three wide through the first turn before settling three wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced on
that rival to apply pressure and was floated four wide through the far turn and came under coaxing with three furlongs to go, angled six wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive latched on to the eighth pole, then got steadily shaken off through to the finish while running on clear for the place honors.
OLYMPIC DREAMS coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper
stretch, weakened. NIMITZ CLASS got bumped between foes who each broke his way at the start, chased two then to three wide coming under coaxing
briefly at the half mile pole, continued just off the inside through the far turn before heading three wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish
when trailing throughout.

Footnotes
RILEY JEAN coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to prevail. LESLIE'S HUMOR coaxed from the start, chased two to
three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, seized command just inside the three-sixteenths, edged away
under a drive before coming under growing threat to the outside, dug in and was nailed on the wire. RECONCILE got backed out and reloaded prior to the
start when leaning in the gate, lost her rear footing at the start but broke forwardly placed despite it, dueled from the three path with DAUGHTER OF TIME
to her inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, floated six wide into upper stretch, yielded the front inside the three-sixteenths and weakened in
the late stages. DAUGHTER OF TIME coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with the aforementioned foe to her outside, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. HEAVEN RULES coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide under coaxing
from the seven-sixteenths, angled six then five wide into upper stretch and tired. PAROLA SICURA coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming
under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to run, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. PROUD MARY broke open the stall door when a bit
fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and trailed
throughout.
