Footnotes
WESTERLAND (GB) unhurried for the first lap, crept a bit closer to race in the second flight in the run up the backstretch the second time, rallied from
between horses upper straight, kicked clear the final furlong. GETTLEMAN prompted the early leader, engaged that one and dueled the middle mile and a
half, vied into the lane, unable to match the winner the final furlong, stayed on to be clear of the others. MOONSHINE TIME (IRE) set a clear early pace,
dueled the middle part, proved no match for the top two in the drive. READY FOR THE LADY went one paced throughout, lacked a closing kick on the
outside down the lane. PRICE TALK void of early foot, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. LAKER MAMBA pulled and was keen early the
opening half mile, fell back before the halfway point and was not a threat. GOD IS LOVE in mid pack for a half, began to give way in the second series up
jumps up the backstretch, continued to weaken to the wire.

Footnotes
CARLOUN (IRE) took control nearing the first fence, got clear before a half, continued to show the way while firmly in hand down the stretch the first time,
extended that advantage a bit after a mile, responded and turned back a bid from a foe into the final turn, clear gain, won geared down late. RUTHENIAN
unhurried for ten furlongs near the back, staged a belated rally through some traffic to be clear of the rest, no match for the winner. VANA BRIGHT moved
up to race closest to the winner after a half, chased that one the middle half, went after that rival from the outside with a half mile remaining dueled briefly
before not being able to keep up, offered little resistance to the runner up soon after, dropped to the inside fort the drive and lasted for the show.
GREYLOVER briefly dueled with the winner inside, chased that one onto the backstraight the first time, fell a bit further the next four furlongs, continued
evenly to the end. NORTHERN RYE lacked speed when racing near the back, displayed some mild late interest after the issue had been decided to
improve position, never a serious threat. LITTLE G T in mid pack while racing between horses, continued in the main body and had nothing for the drive.
LOVE FOREVERAFTER also raced in the main group, lacked a closing response as well. HASHTAG NO WONDER secured good position toward the
inside, had nothing left for the final five furlongs. EXTRA CRUNCHY lagged well back throughout and was never involved.

Footnotes
EVIE'S PRINCE unhurried for for ten furlongs, began to advance before the final jump, was moving smartly thorough the final turn, inhaled the leader
entering the straight, quickly well clear, ridden out. AUCTION KINGDOM settled off the pace, raced in the second flight into the final turn, dueled through the
stretch for the second spot closest to the inside, prevailed while no threat to the winner. BOURBON DIVERSION took command from the start, extended
lead, offered little resistance to the winner when that one came calling exiting the final turn, found more to duel for the place, proved stubborn for that
position to the end. WICKED WEST (IRE) settled off the pace, continued to race one paced second lap, not enough late for the show spot in lacking a
significant response. RECENT REVELATIONS (IRE) closest to the leader for much of the trip, begin to give way entering the final turn. SOUTHPAW MIKE
trailed well back, was never involved. PROPHETS VOICE (IRE) lacked speed, also had nothing for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MI BAGO bit restless in the gate, away in good order, dueled up front in the two path, disposed of the other speed by late in the turn, remained comfortably
clear through the stretch while under steady handling. ALL THE LUCK broke with the winner, dueled inside that one for just under three furlongs, proved no
match in the drive, clearly second best. MISSION ARTEMIS reluctant to load, broke a step behind the top two, moved off the inside through the turn, came
four wide for the drive, along for the show, no threat to the top pair. FLY COMMANDER chased the dueling leaders in the three path, could do little with pair
through the lane, caught for the show spot. FLOATING SMOKEY lacked any early foot, made little impact through the stretch. FANTASY FLYER reared at
the start then broke in a tangle to spot the field several lengths and to lose all chance. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SEVILLA in the second flight early toward the inside, steered out when advancing on the leader late in the turn, collared that rival entering the stretch to gain
the advantage, held the runner up safe late under firm handling while outside that rival. SUZIES PRIDE in tight and bumped at the start, raced back off the
pace as a result, moved closer while saving ground through the turn, moved out a bit turning for home while still inside the winner, made little progress on
that one the final sixteenth, clearly best of the others. KUKU raced back off the pace while well out in the strip, four to five wide through the turn, proved best
of the rest through the stretch no threat to the top pair. SHOW' EM NOLA broke out to bother a couple of outer rivals, was straightened to briefly duel
backstretch, shook clear in to the turn, offered little resistance to the winner when that one came calling late in the bend, weakened when headed and
continued to gradually falter through the stretch. INFERNO flashed brief speed early to duel along the inside, began a steady retreat after a quarter. GO
ISHLA bumped at the start to be last away, trailed throughout.

JUST FOR THE MONEY behind the pace while outside, three wide out of the turn, floated out a bit in falling off the two leaders when straightened for home,
set down, finished full of run late to be up in time. CHADO dueled up front along the inside, narrowly showed the way into the stretch when gaining a larger
advantage, turned back a bid from GREY FLANNEL BOSS past the furlong marker, continued to lead late, nailed in the final strides, narrowly lasted for the
place. ARCTIC OUTBREAK lacked speed for three furlongs, came four to five wide into the stretch, angled in, called on for run and rallied from between
horses to finish up willingly while getting to the runner up late. GREY FLANNEL BOSS stalked the dueling leaders along the inside under patient handling,
eased out a bit and lodged a brief bid approaching midstretch, failed to follow through with that challenge to the wire. PRINSIPITO off a step slow, lacked a
response in the drive. FEAR THE FACTS dueled up front while outside the runner, fell back off that one turning for home, drifted out in upper stretch
carrying the winner out, continued to weaken to the wire.

THE BRIGADE unhurried early along the inside, continued in hand the middle half, moved out, came four wide for the drive, rallied with good energy out in
the middle of the course to win going away. PATRICK'S PROMISE closest to the leader, continued to prompt that one second turn, challenged from the
outside, gained the advantage but could not contain the winner in proving no match for that one. TKAC fell back to trail after the start, continued to see them
all up the backstretch, staged a belated rally between horses to be up late for the show. MEISTERSINGER cleared toward the inside to show the way
through the first turn, continued to set the pace, briefly responded when the runner up challenged past the furlong marker then faltered when headed by that
one, caught late for the show. TONY ECLIPSE last to leave, moved up to race in mid pack, crept a bit closer in the final turn, flattened out in the drive.
RHYTHM 'N BLUES in the second flight inside the runner up, in tight, checked up to quickly fall back and lose all chance.

Footnotes
LIGHT FURY broke on top, showed the way into the first turn in the two path and under light restraint, continued to rate under a mild hold in run up the
backstraight, extended that advantage into the stretch, enough left to hold the runner up at bay while finishing up along the inside. SLIPPIN JIMMY tracked
the leader along the inside, continued to follow that one into and through the final turn, moved out slightly for the drive and was slowly closing the gap on
that rival in the waning strides. NAUTILUS settled in mid pack while off the inside, called on for run midway on the final bend, briefly broke stride with a
furlong to run, was up in time for the show while along the rail at the wire. VAN lacked early foot off the rail, also asked along in the second turn, displayed
some late interest while between horses to better himself slightly in the late going. DAZZLING TRUTHS one paced in lacking speed, saved some ground
into the lane, moved off the rail late and displayed some modest late energy. ARTEMUS BRIDGE hopped at the start, void of speed, lacked a serious
closing response while off the inside. UNCLE ANDREW prompted the winner from the outside for six furlongs, gave way in the drive. POLAR WIND off a
step slow, remained back in failing to threaten. CAJUN'S MAGIC in mid pack toward the inside, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
WHITE HEAT broke sharp to soon get clear, showed the way into and through the turn along the inside firmly in hand, maintained a comfortable advantage
through the lane while only being shown the crop to win ridden out. CHICA MUSIC moved up to head up the second flight in chasing the winner through the
turn, could do little with that rival through the stretch, remained clear for the runner up spot. MAS VICTORIA off a step slow then was bothered by
CHEYENNE SPRING as that one came out just after the break, dropped quickly to the inside, continued to save ground turn, staged a mild rally up the rail
to outkick that same rival for the show spot. CHEYENNE SPRING came out early to bother MAS VICTORIA, was straightened to race off the pace and the
inside, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick, outfinished for the show. TIA MAYIN settled off the early pace, had nothing for the drive.
GREYGRAZIE chased the winner early while off the inside, began a steady after three furlongs.

Footnotes
SMALL FIELD prompted the early leader off the inside, advanced to challenge that one before a half, dueled the middle five furlongs, edged away turning
into the straight, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire while being kept to task. CLINT MAROON (GB) taken in hand after the start, raced a bit
keen along the rail early, continued in hand, asked along into the lane, steady rally from between horses to gain the place. TOLAGA BAY settled off the
pace toward the front early, fell back some in the middle half mile, came three wide for the drive, slight drift, not enough late for the place while narrowly
holding the show. EL DE LARRY lacked speed off the inside, also was three wide out of the final turn, steered out inside the furlong grounds, displayed
some mild late interest to be gaining for the show. BATI KING cleared early toward the inside to show the way through the first turn, was joined by the
winner before a half, altered with that one into the far turn, first to blink exiting that bend. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM raced in the second flight came up
empty for the stretch run while outside. BODE'S MAKER last away, continued to trail throughout and showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
MEGEEZER in the second flight early three wide and between horses, crept closer to the leader into the turn, lost some ground outside that one into the
lane, roused, rallied, kept coming while being floated out by the drifting leader, wore that one down late. COUNTRY ECONOMICS broke alertly, cleared
then angled toward the inside, showed the way into and through the turn in the two path, steadily drifted out through the lane to carry the winner out, gave
ground grudgingly to that one while lasting for the place. MONSTER SUMMER lacked early foot, three wide into the straight, angled inside of the drifting out
first flight, up for the show, not enough late for the second spot. QUEEN VALENTINA in the second group up the backstretch outside the winner, four wide
through the bend, bit closer by late in the bend, floated out midstretch when pursuing the top two, caught for the show. V INSPIRED one paced while along
the inside early, continued to save ground through the turn, lacked a closing response. VALLEY STAR lacked early speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals
after the issue had been decided. SHIRLEY KNOT in the second group while closest to the inside, tired through the lane. NEVER WALK ALONE within
distance between horses and inside the winner, gave way after four furlongs. CHELLS GIRL hesitated at the start to spot the field a couple of lengths,
continued to trail to be outrun.

Footnotes
XY TIME broke on top, set the pace inside, rated kindly in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, steadily increased advantage through the final
bend and upper stretch, kept to pressure the final furlong to prove clearly best. NEW YORK PANTHER in the second flight outside, moved closest to the
winner in the three path far turn, continued to chase that one in vain through the stretch while in an extended duel for the runner up spot, proved game in
that respect, no match winner. E. P. MILTON settled in mid pack while off the inside, advanced along with the runner up off the inside second turn, hooked
up with that same rival for a spirted duel for second, outfinished. RECONVENE off a step slow, raced back, came four wide for the drive, widest through the
stretch, staged a mild rally to improve position, no real threat to the top three. LOWCOUNTRY within striking distance along the inside, continued to save
ground, had little left for the drive. NOBLE CONQUEST void of early foot for six furlongs, passed tiring rivals without ever posing a serious threat.
ELEVATED FOREVER underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, remained always back in failing to muster a rally. SPRITZER chased the winner for five
furlongs off the inside, gave way. MINT GAME beat a steady retreat after a half.
