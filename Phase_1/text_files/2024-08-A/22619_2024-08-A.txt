Footnotes
SANDMAN chased just off the inside and then along the inside patiently handled, took the inside route into upper stretch along a clear rail and was roused
straightened away, rallied to take command just outside the eighth pole, edged away under a drive to prevail. INNOVATOR established the front and
showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in and was caught
nearing the eighth pole, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. AVIATOR GUI four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths and advanced through the latter portion of the turn, continued four wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive to preserve the show
honors while never threatening the top pair. THUNDER ROLL four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch in aim of the leader, tucked three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. NANTZ broke a half a beat slow and was
sluggish early on and crossed to the inside conceding about five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased just off the inside and then along the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. JUJUBEE chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, made no impact. DEVIL OF RAMADI brushed the near side stall at the start when breaking
inwards, raced forwardly placed three wide down the backstretch and then tipped four wide through the turn and retreated under light coaxing with
seven-sixteenths to go all the way to the rear of the field with five-sixteenths remaining, angled seven to eight wide into upper stretch eased along, then got
pulled up inside the final sixteenth, got attended to by veterinarian with water and was subsequently transported off the course by equine ambulance.

Footnotes
BANNED FOR LIFE came in and bumped soundly with a foe after the start, pressed the pace quick pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn,
was asked nearing the quarter-pole, took over in the four path into upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and drew away under strong urging.
HURRICANE NELSON broke alertly and went straight to the front, showed the way on the inside of a rival through fast fractions, dropped from the two path
to the inside early on the turn, was roused inside the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, dropped back into the final
furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. READY AS EVER dropped well behind while ridden along, moved from the two path to the rail early
on the turn, saved ground from that point into the stretch and improved for the show. WAJDA lost his footing at the start then was bumped soundly early,
was grabbed with the left-rein while recovering from the contact, raced outside of an opponent while coaxed along off the pace, came under stronger
encouragement in the two path on the turn and lacked the needed response. TOMORROW'S WISH dropped back while urged along on the outside, went
around the turn in the four path and was no factor. MARCHE lost his footing while away awkwardly and was off a step slow, settled on the inside, was
roused along the rail on the turn, shifted to the three path late on that bend, spun into the five path entering the stretch then drifted in and failed to respond
then was reported to have bled. HARD SCHOLAR showed brief speed between horses then dropped back while urged along on the outside, traveled
around the turn in the three path and faltered.

Footnotes
FAST KIMMIE raced between horses in the two path for most of the first turn then was eased back before dropping to the inside, established a good
position just behind the leader traveling down the backstretch, drafted inside early on the far turn then moved off the rail, angled to the four path near the
five-sixteenths pole, rallied to the lead in upper stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. MISS
FASHIONISTA broke out then was hustled, dropped from the five path to the four path early on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid
leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the far turn, took the advantage outside the five-sixteenths pole, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, lost
the lead to the winner in upper stretch, fought on well with that foe in the final furlong but missed while well clear for second. BERTRILLE raced in the three
path while between foes most of the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along late on the backstretch, came under stronger encouragement in the three
path on the far turn, was put to the crop in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. MIM was last away then moved up to get the lead, raced inside
on the first turn, showed the way while off the rail on the backstretch, was asked in the two path under threat early on the far turn, lost the advantage outside
the five-sixteenths pole then moved closer to the rail, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and capitulated.

SHOWCASE chased just off the inside down the backstretch before briefly tipping inside near the half mile pole, went back to the two path through the turn
and followed the leader through the bend coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and was in
behind the leader when nudged to the rail due to pressure outside from TOUCHY and SMOKEN WICKED trading jostles, tipped back to the two path
nudging ACE IT and gained clearance as the leader drifted in in front, got roused into daylight quickly collaring that leader a sixteenth from home before
edging clear to the finish in hand in the final strides. FIRST RESORT broke in at the start filling the space left vacant by GLOBAL LEGEND who also broke
inwards, knocked heads in hand early on with ACE IT before establishing sole command five furlongs out, steadily shook away into the turn before coming
under pressure from that rival with five-sixteenths to go and was placed to coaxing at that station in response, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive drifting to the rail a furlong out, dug in under new threat and was collared at the sixteenth pole, ran on to preserve the place honors on the
wire. SMOKEN WICKED chased along the inside briefly before tipping to the two path five furlongs from home, tipped three wide at the half mile pole forcing
TOUCHY to the four path at the half mile pole, came under coaxing tipped four wide at the three-eighths carrying TOUCHY five wide at that station, swung
four wide into upper stretch leaning out against TOUCHY and was denied the lean and bumped back to his four path straightened away, had TOUCHY
come in on him at the three-eighths and was pushed three wide before jostling his way back four wide near the eighth pole aided by pressure inside, then
ran on to miss for the place honors while clear for the show. TOUCHY three wide in pursuit, got nudged four wide at the half mile pole when SMOKEN
WICKED tipped out to the three path at that station, got floated out five wide midway on the turn by that rival, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
continued five wide into upper stretch and was being leaned on by the aforementioned foe, came in at the three-sixteenths nudging that rival to three path
when briefly taking the four path, got nudged back outwards a furlong out and weakened in the late stages. ACE IT led early on before being engaged by
FIRST RESORT five and a half furlongs out, got headed for command and prompted that rival from the four path down the backstretch before tucking three
wide into the turn, advanced to knock heads through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, got
shaken off straightened away and was bumping between foes at the three-sixteenths and then leaned on a furlong out and weakened in the final furlong.
GLOBAL LEGEND broke in a step at the start, bobbled just after and chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, offered no response. GOOD DIRECTIONS got bumped solidly at the start by KEEP IT EASY who came inwards from a bad
stumble, got buckled by the contact and bobbled heavily conceding three lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, chased four to five paths
off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the drive. KEEP IT EASY stumbled badly at the start collapsing inwards and crashing into GOOD DIRECTIONS pushing that rival askew and
then bobbled once more, the rider showing great athleticism to stay upright and onboard and keep his feet in both irons and conceded five to six lengths to
the front before settling into stride, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing three
furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch focusing on SHOWCASE,
SMOKEN WICKED and TOUCHY. After review, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

SURVEILLANCE was restless in the gate then broke in the air and was off a step slow, moved in while urged along off the pace, drafted in dead-aim of the
leaders while in the two then three path on the turn, made a bid late on that bend, took over in upper stretch then was asked inside the three-sixteenths,
fought outside of two opponents into the final furlong then drew clear under a mild hand-ride to win ridden out. OUTLAW KID was hustled to the front,
showed the way on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked late on that bend, lost the advantage in upper stretch, fought inside of two
rivals into the final furlong and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. STEP FORWARD was hustled from the gate, attended the pace on
the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was given his cue late on that bend, came under a drive between horses in upper stretch, battled between foes
into the final furlong and also proved no match for the winner then just missed the place while clear for the show. DISARMED broke out at the start then was
hustled, chased the pace on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn and tired. THIN WHITE DUKE was hustled from the gate then ridden along at
the rear, saved ground on the turn, moved off the rail outside the quarter-pole, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
