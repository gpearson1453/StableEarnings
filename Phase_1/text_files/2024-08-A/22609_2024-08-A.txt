Footnotes
COPPERLITE led early but took back around the first turn to stalk in the four path down the backside, bid under a ride in the three path going into the far
turn, took command midway around the far turn, kicked away from the six path entering the stretch, drifted out in the final furlong, but continued to draw
away. LAS OLAS laid in range from the four path, was coaxed from the five path into the far turn, and chased on from the six path in the stretch for place.
LOOKINASSAH chased in the six path, was under right handed encouragement in the four path going around the far turn, and finished evenly from the
seven path in the stretch for show. GUAIO trailed in the two path and made no impact. FAST CHAD raced off the pace in the three path and failed to bid.
CHACHARERO rated in the five path but never threatened. BREAK THE ICE tracked in the three path but weakened. MOON WATCH (IRE) got rank early
to set a clear pace in the two path turning into the backstretch, but gaveway after the quarter.

Footnotes
MISS MARY NELL stalked the pace three wide, took over in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. LE TOUCHE bumped with OCEAN STAR at the start,
saved ground in range, swung four wide in upper stretch and finished willingly to be clearly second best. BELLE MIA trailed inside, made progress at the rail
around the far turn and was along for the show. CHEESE pressed the pace two wide and weakened in the drive. CAJUN PRIME set the pace along the rail
and tired in the stretch. OCEAN STAR bumped at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide and lacked a closing bid. PRAYED FOR GIRL played no
factor while racing three and four wide.

to the four path at the top of the lane, and kicked away on her left lead. WIGGLE AN' WINE set the pace in the three path, received a right handed cue in
the two path midway around the turn, but lost the lead before the quarter, and chased on from the three path in the stretch for place. BEE A QUEEN rated
inside, was coaxed along in the two path around the turn, and finished evenly for show. VALIANT KISS had an awkward bobble at the start, trailed in the
three path and made no impact. THEE NEW BEGINNING chased in the four path, floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, and never threatened.
VUELA PALOMA prompted the pace in the five path but weakened.

going away. MACHO MUSIC bumped at the start, vied three wide between foes down the backstretch and two wide between around the far turn, edged
ahead in upper stretch but was no match for the winner late. BIG SHOULDERS led at the rail early, settled back entering the turn, raced off the pace in the
two path around most of the bend, angled four wide turning for home and ran on to gain the show. OLEG had early speed between foes, chased at he rail
around the turn and faded in the lane. MY SATISFACTION bumped at the start, saved ground and never threatened. DREAMBUILDER failed to menace
while racing three wide. TEMPO RIDE bumped at the start, raced three wide and made little imapct. SILVER PUNCH bumped at the start and trailed inside.

NO VALLA broke out at the start, rated in the three path, was roused from the four path into the far turn, ranged up to take aim while floating out to the eight
path at the top of the stretch, and rallied past an inner trio to be up around the sixteenth. OKAY FINE broke out at the start, laid up close in the four path,
was coaxed along in the three path around the far turn, bid in the four path turning into the stretch, ran on to lead passing the eighth pole, but was caught by
an outer foe around the sixteenth to place. SALS DREAM GIRL trailed inside, angled out to the seven path in upper stretch, and kicked on to get up for
show. LE BEAU tracked in the three path, but got stymied in the two path passing the quarter, stayed on to bid passing the eighth pole, but evened out.
LINNY KATE stalked in the four path but flattened. MOBAY PRINCESS set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside midway around the far
turn, but faded in the stretch. DOUBLE COSMO GIRL chased in the five path but never threatened. CLEOPATRA'S NILE was unhurried in the four path

Footnotes
NAUGHTY RASCAL bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the four path, bid between foes passing the quarter, took the lead while tipping out to
the five path in upper stretch, exchanged bumps with an outer foe while dueling into the final furlong, and dug in to hold on. CLASSIC OF COURSE was
reluctant to load, then broke in and bumped an inner for at the start, raced off the pace in the six path, ranged up in the five path passing the quarter, bid in
the six path entering the stretch, exchanged bumps with an inner foe while dueling down the stretch, but was edged out to place. JOEY MUSCLES laid up
close along the inside, was roused midway around the turn but got immediately stymied passing the quarter, tipped out to the three path turning into the
lane, and kept on for show. RAFID broke out at the start, was hustled along from in range in the three path, ridden in the two path around the turn, floated
out to the five path turning into the stretch, but was one paced. I'MBIGGERTHANILOOK set the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the rail around the
turn, but faded. LEGAL MANEUVER was reluctant to load, trailed in the four path early and never threatened. MILA'S WISH prompted the pace in the four
path, bid from the three path midway around the turn, led passing the quarter, but weakened in the two path down the lane. ROCKA STORM steadied
between foes at the start, rated in the three path but never menaced.

Footnotes
QUATROCENTO had early speed between foes, was wrangled back nearing the first turn, raced in range two wide around that bend, remained in touch
while racing three and four wide around the far turn, closed outside and was up on the wire. BELL MOUNTAIN stalked the pace from the rail, angled three
wide near the quarter pole, rallied between foes, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and led until the final stride. GOES THE CLOWN tracked the pace
four wide around the first turn, bid three wide around the far turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth
pole and held on the for the show. COME TO PAPA saved ground off the pace, angled four wide nearing the sixteenth pole, switched back to the left lead
and rallied. FREGON set the pace in the two path, was collared near the five-sixteenths marker and weakened inside. NEVER SAY NEVER failed to
menace while racing two and three wide. BEACH GOLD steadied at the start, raced well back inside, swung seven wide in upper stretch and never
threatened. HANGIN IN THERE chased the pace four and five wide and faded in the lane. FIVEEYESONSKYSTARS pressed the pace in the three path,
faded around the far turn, steadied while tiring near the quarter pole and had no further bids. HIGH PRINCE hopped at the start, raced two wide and was
never involved. JIMBO BAILEY had his head turned at the start and trailed inside.
