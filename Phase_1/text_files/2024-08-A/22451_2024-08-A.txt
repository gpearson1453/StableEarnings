Footnotes
OUT OF LUCK went to the front to an unchallenged pace throughout and held on. SHE SO COOL went five wide into the first turn then raced close up on
the pace from four wide, made a late run in the stretch to be second best. KESTENNA (GB) was unhurried through the final turn then angled out to five or
six wide in upper stretch to make a mid track rally for the show. ALWAYS CONNECTED tracked the leader from the two path through the final turn then
shifted in for a late bid but was outfniished. BOH'S N O'S raced in the middle of the pack on the first turn then moved up to contention from three wide on the
backstretch, kept on but lacked the late response in the stretch. FABULOUS CANDY was forwardly placed while racing between horses but lacked a rally.
MY JO JO raced near the back around the first turn then steadily advanced from three wide through the final turn then tipped out to four or five wide in upper
stretch but was empty. KILLARGUE'S GIRL was always back. BOOTSY'S MERLOT raced off the pace while saving ground down the backstretch then fell
back and was not a factor.

Footnotes
POSITIVELY AWESOME rushed up the rail to take the pressured lead, headed at the quarter pole and dueled between MINXZHIPPSDONTLEYE and
PISTOL OR SHOTGUN down the stretch, dug in late for the win under determined handling. PISTOL OR SHOTGUN went to the early led then vied for the
lead from three wide, engaged the leader at the top of the stretch and dueled outside of POSITIVELY AWESOME and MINXZHIPPSDONTLEYE to the wire
while fighting gamely but was outkicked. MINXZHIPPSDONTLEYE raced in the middle of the pack on the backstretch then advanced on the turn and
slipped through on the inside into the stretch to duel inside of POSITIVELY AWESOME and PISTOL OR SHOTGUN to the wired but gave way grudgingly.
STAR WEAVER raced in the middle of the pack from the inside through the turn then angled out to six wide in upper stretch and made a late rally. RAHMER
pressed the pace from the two path for a furlong then raced off the pace on the inside but fell back on the turn and was empty in the stretch. ROCKIN
FREEBEE raced near the back on the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the turn, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch but had no late kick.
BORGOBYTHESEA showed no early speed and was outrun.

PAYOUT RATIO (IRE) went to the clear lead to set all the pace, pulled away on the final turn and was kept to task in the stretch. DREAMING OF ABBA
saved ground while racing off the pace down the backstretch then moved out to two wide on the final turn to take a run at the leader, shifted back inside for
the late kick in the stretch but was no match for the winner. PUT A ROCK ON IT was forwardly placed in the two path down the backstretch, moved to
contention entering the final turn and made a mild bid but lacked the late response. HEYBACKATCHA stalked the pace from three wide down the
backstretch, made a mild bid on the final turn but was empty in the stretch. APRIL APRIL chased the leaders down the backstretch, moved out to four wide
in upper stretch to pass a tired rival. HONORABLE CHILL was rank around the first turn then tracked the leaders down the backstretch, fell back on the final
turn and was not a factor. BY THE GLASS was allowed to settle into the first turn, trailed the field and was never involved.

ARTISTIC REASON went to a pressured lead midway through the first turn then pulled away on the final turn to draw off and was ridden out. GHOST
STALKER was hustled away from the gate, stalked the pace down the backstretch, made a rail bid on the final turn and gave a late kick to hold on for the
place. GREYZER settled in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, made a mild bid from three wide on the final turn, moved between horses at the
eighth pole and missed the place. HEFFNER pressed the pace to the five furlong marker while being within striking distance to the final turn and faded.
WYNN GIANT raced near or at the back through the final turn then made a stretch run to pass tiring rivals. ANGELUS WARRIOR raced five wide into the
first turn then vied for the lead from three wide to the five furlong marker, then two wide through the final turn, went five wide into the upper stretch but was
empty. ZIPPER ZAPPER tracked the leaders from two wide around the first turn then raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground but was not a
factor. UNCLE WATER FLOW was never a threat.

Footnotes
CESNOLA raced in the middle of the pack from the inside around the first turn then steadily advance through the final turn from four wide, dueled outside of
MUNGO in the stretch drive and prevailed. MUNGO was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack from two wide down the backstretch then made a bid on
the final turn, dueled down the stretch inside of CESNOL to the wire but was denied. STARFORCE was unhurried while racing near the back to the final turn
then made a three wide bid on the final turn and tipped out to mid track in the stretch for the late rally. BRAVE SAND RIDER prompted the pace from the
two path to the final turn then engaged the leader at the three furlong marker and kicked clear into the stretch, ducked in at the turf chute in the stretch and
weakened. JOHNNY FROM BOSTON tracked the leaders from the inside through the final turn, tipped out to the two path in the stretch but failed to
menace. HOYA raced off the pace from the two path around the first turn then steadily retreated. BALI RIDDIM raced in the middle of the pack while saving
ground but was not a factor. WALKER'S GAP was off slow and trailed the field by many lengths, made a mild bid in the stretch to pass tiring rivals. I
WANNA ROCK went to a clear lead down the backstretch then was headed near the three furlong marker and gave way. BOURBON EXPRESS stalked the
pace from three wide through the final turn and tired.

SCARAMOUCHE to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. POINT DUME rushed away from the gate to a clear lead but was collared at the eighth pole and

Footnotes
OCEAN CITY showed good early speed to go to the front to set all the pace, drew off in the stretch to prove best. POSSIBLEMENTE trailed the field down
the backstretch then launched a three wide bid on the final turn, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch having his best strides late but was not enough.
UNINVITED GUEST stalked the paced from the inside through the final turn then made a late inside stretch run to be up for show. NAPOLEON'S WAR
raced off the pace from three wide down the backstretch, moved up on the final turn but couldn't catch the leader and was outfinished in the drive. LURE
HIM IN was allowed to settle in the middle of the pace on the inside to the top of the stretch, angled out to three or four wide and improved position.
SIMOVITCH was always back. TISSA prompted the pace from the two path to the final turn then fell back around the turn, lost rider at the sixteenth pole and
was giving a ride in the equine ambulance.

Footnotes
RUDY RUDY RUDY raced well of the pace into the far turn, moved effortlessly to the lead leaving the quarter pole, kept alter in upper stretch, lugged in
nearing the furlong marker, and held safe under a drive. SIDNEY'S BID tracked the leader from the start, given his que around the far turn, quickly took
control of the lead, under outside pressure in upper stretch fought on inside that rival but was out kicked to the wire. BAD HENRY raced well off the early
pace and off the rail, under a hand ride circled the field with ease around the far turn, willingly chased the top pair through the stretch. SETTE STELLE
settled in off the pace and off the rail, moved up between runners down the backside, encountered traffic around the far turn, and weakened through the
stretch. GENERAL J R lagged behind the field around the first turn and down the backside, came up empty through the stretch. BRUSH RUSH ground
saving trip around the first turn and down the backside, urged along into the far turn, gave way from the quarter pole. ON THE CHILL , was a step slow
leaving the gate, rushed up outside the field to grab the lead heading around the first turn, set the tempo into the far turn, came under pressure leaving the
three eights pole, and was eased from the quarter pole.
