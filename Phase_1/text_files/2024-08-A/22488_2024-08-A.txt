Footnotes
AMALFI DRIVE quick to begin to set the pace, raced in hand throughout and drew to be an easy winner while never being asked. FIVE A SIDE was under a
hard chase after the early leader, ducked out a bit near the three eighths pole, kept on in the drive but was no match for the winner. FUR ELISE broke
awkwardly, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, raced two deep near the quarter pole, swung seven wide into the upper stretch and was even
with no closing run on the top pair. SO MUCH JAZZ dropped back off the early pace, raced near the inside past the quarter pole and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
MO REWARDS stalked the pace inside to foes, hard ridden near the three eighths pole, raced six wide into the upper stretch and finished well to edge away
late under steady pressure. COUPERIN set a pressured early pace, resisted mid stretch and kept on with a game effort. HUSBAND MATERIAL stalked the
pace, loomed four wide around the far turn and flattened out. CARNIVORE pressed the early leader from the outside early down the backstretch and faded.
QUIET REBEL lost ground to race far back and never threatened.

SECRET LIFE chased the pace setter from the outside into the turn, bid four wide leaving the quarter pole, under a stiff left hand bumped SHEZA NASTY
GIRL in upper stretch, dueled inside that rival through the stretch, got the nod under an all out drive. SHEZA NASTY GIRL hooped at the start, settled in off
the pace and three wide for the run into the turn, bid five wide leaving the quarter pole, bumped with SECRET LIFE in upper stretch, dueled outside that rival
through the final furlong and was denied at the wire. CHARLIZE CHUB broke sharp, set the pace from the inside, drifted off the inside leaving the quarter
pole, dueled between runners through the stretch, and finished willingly to the wire. STEAL THE DEAL broke a step slow, recovered quickly and tracked
inside into the turn, waited behind horses around the bend, accelerated quickly when the rail position came open, dueled inside through the stretch, was out
kicked in the final fifty yards.
