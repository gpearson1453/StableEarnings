GOOD ACCELEBRATE stumbled inward and into Imagine Rita leaving the gate then settled back from early contention while saving ground, started a long
steady bid leaving the nine sixteenths pole and took the lead three wide past the five sixteenths, drew away on the far turn, was kept alert through the upper
stretch then taken in hand later yards. SOMEBODY LOVES ME raced well off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, steadily improved in
the four path on the far turn and came along for second mid-stretch. DASHING LASS ducked out and made contact with Imagine Rita leaving the gate then
saved ground, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and dueled for third the final sixteenth. LINDA'S TAJ tapered in
through the front stretch and rated the pace, came under pressure at the three eighths pole, was met leaving the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn near
the rail and weakened in the lane. LADY CAIRO stalked through the front stretch but was forced wide into the first turn, corrected course and challenged
from the three eighths pole but flattened off the rail on the far turn. IMAGINE RITA was squeezed at the break, raced in the three path the first turn and
showed little response through the backstretch. ITSUPTOME drifted into the first turn and was through after a half mile.

NICO broke inward then gave chase, raced close in the four path on the turn, dug in for the nod inside the sixteenth pole and inched further ahead nearing
the wire. PRIMAL DESTINY set a pressured pace while tapering inward, moved to the rail approaching the quarter pole, was met mid-stretch and reluctantly
ceded later yards. STORM BOARDER (CHI) pressured the early pace but steadied off the heels of Nico leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn
about the three path and dug in to take third the final strides. DANCE CODE was pinched back at the start then gave chase inside, rounded the turn near
the rail, eased out into the lane and finished well to pass rivals. MR TINGLES pressured the pace inside then steadied off the inside flank of Nico
approaching the quarter pole, rounded the turn near the rail and flattened later yards. INSIDE RISK chased outside, rounded the turn in the four and five
paths and weakened in the lane. CARIBBEAN PLEASURE broke outward then gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and weakened nearing
mid-stretch. The Stewards reviewed then rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Primal Destiny for alleged interference approaching the quarter pole,
lodged by the rider of Storm Boarder.

CASTLE LIGHTS took over on the chute and rated clear, came under pressure past the quarter pole, rounded the turn at the rail and was kept alert in the
stretch. NAUGHTY NAN exchanged contact with Comida Comida leaving the gate then gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn and dug in the final
furlong to take second late yards. JUBA'S HOUSE chased inside and raced close off the rail on the turn, but drifted into the lane and flattened stride later
yards. COMIDA COMIDA exchanged contact with Naughty Nan leaving the gate then gave chase, rounded the turn in the four path, left the turn outside and
showed little further. MY SISTER CLURRIE gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and weakened. REIGN ON AND ON

Footnotes
SCOTTSDALE took the lead and moved to the inside entering the first turn, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, rounded the far turn near
the rail and was kept alert in the stretch. MOON OVER MONTANA saved ground off the pace, bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole and raced close in
the three path on the far turn, but couldn't gain in the stretch. CANTAKEITANYMORE settled off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and flattened in the lane. MAKE WAY saved ground racing well off the pace, gave chase leaving the half mile
pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. MR HOOVER stalked off the rail, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole then faded at the rail
on the far turn. CARTE BLANCHE stalked from the two and three paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened past the three eighths.
KING THEO was pulled up lame after three sixteenths and was vanned off.
