BRONX TALE saved ground throughout, bid to the front at the top of the stretch and edged off under steady handling. TATUM set a clear pace off the inside
for half a mile, was collared and weakened. CHASING STARDOM prompted the pace outside to midstretch and faltered. CRACK THE CODE lagged far
behind then passed a stopping rival. WARRIOR'S VOW broke slowly and was always outrun. GOLD BLING chased the top trio and gave way readily.

SATCHEL DE RITCHES settled close up inside, slipped through passing the eighth pol and was just up following a long battle. DIESEL set a pressured
pace early, moved to a clear lead at the quarter pole and finished gamely to the wire. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE settled off the pace, swung wide in the stretch
with a steady late gain. EMPIRE'S SCORE was reserved behind the dueling leaders then made a gradual late gain. HOPE FOR GOLD forced the pace
outside to the stretch then weakened. TACTICAL PLAN dropped far behind and trailed throughout.

DAD'S ON A ROLL settled off the pace inside, angled out on the final turn and rallied clear in the final eighth. KANE trailed early, advanced inside, moved
out in the stretch closing well. GOLDEN WILDCAT prompted the pace outside, led narrowly in the stretch then weakened. RUNNIN JOKE hustled to the
front inside, vied through the final turn and came up empty in the lane. SOUTHERN RUNNER moved close up inside to the stretch and faltered. OMERTA
CODE dropped back wide and lacked a solid rally. DISTURBED urged just off the leaders three wide and faded after half a mile. EXCLUSIVE ORDER
made a brief menacing wide bid on the final turn then gave way.

MS MERRABEL led narrowly inside, shook loose into the far turn and drew away under mild urging. SOLEMN OATH forced the pace, faded briefly on the
turn then came again to gain the place while no match for the winner. STARSHIP BLANCA moved close up between rivals for half a mile, bid inside on the
turn and flattened out. ONE WILD WOMAN raced just off the leaders inside, eased back on the turn and was no threat. MS. MALEVOLENCE made a
menacing three wide move near the three eighths pole then gave way. FRAME THIS dropped far behind and trailed throughout.

MEGA CHARLIE controlled the pace, repelled challenges, shook clear again and stayed safe driving. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM settled close up inside,
angled out, loomed a threat and was second best. WE BE THERE rated outside off the pace, moved wide in the stretch then went evenly late. CAPE
HEDGE dropped back, chased wide and narrowed the gap slightly. GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS prompted the winner to the stretch and faltered.
HE'SSOSUBTLE trailed for half a mile and was never in contention. TRUE DAKOTAN bobbled slightly into the first turn and was always outrun. SKILLFUL
lacked speed and gave way readily.

ECONOMIC POWER stalked the dueling leaders outside, bid to the front in the stretch and edged away driving. HURRICANE HIGHWAY dropped far
behind then advanced near the inside too late. SENSIBLE JIM alternated for the lead outside and weakened slightly in the stretch. STRAWBERRY CONE
vied along the inside then faltered in the stretch. MY DEVILS CHILD raced close up outside, was carried very wide at the quarter pole and failed to recover.
THE TWINS SNEAKERS lacked speed, chased inside and lacked a solid response. BOX OF CHOCOLATES moved close up inside, drifted very wide tiring
at the quarter pole. MOLIERE lagged far behind and was never in contention. MAXIM MOMENT chased in midpack outside and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
BIRD KING rated close up inside, angled out in the stretch and wore down the pacesetter in the final furlong. TYCOON set a pressured pace inside,
remained clear to the late stages but was nailed nearing the wire. UNDER THE RADAR trailed for three quarters, moved very wide into the stretch rallying.
IT'S GAME TIME dropped back inside, moved closer on the final turn then flattened out. DIVINE MIRACLE raced in close pursuit of the leader between
rivals then gave way. SPEIGHTSTER RED raced just off the leaders three wide, bid at the quarter pole then faded. KHOZY MY BOY raced off the pace
outside, was asked for run on the final turn then weakened.

EMPIRE PASS sped to a clear advantage in hand, widened under moderate urging in the stretch and was never seriously threatened. KNOWING GLANCE
broke alertly and pursued the winner in range then proved no match through the stretch. CARTOUCHE chased off the pace three wide and continued well
for the show. TARA'S TALENT raced well off the leaders between foes and gave way. CAUSE I SAID angled inside down the backstretch while outrun and
lacked a rally.

D' FUTURE broke slowest, moved to contention outside and was no factor. ROLIN N CONTROLIN chased wide off the leaders and passed fading rivals.
BELLA MARIA raced along the inside and was never a factor. FRIEDER FANATIC raced wide far behind and was always outrun. ROAD TO DREAMS
dropped off the pace early and was never involved. AMERICA'S PRIDE showed speed in the two path to the far turn and stopped.
