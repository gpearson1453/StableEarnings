Footnotes
CLAIRE JUNE settled into second flight around the opening bend, raced into traffic at the midway point, rated three wide at upper stretch, then kept to task
in final furlong for the score. KIRBY KAYE trekked three wide early and rated in the second flight through the opening half, swung to be widest of all at upper
stretch, and earned the place with the best stride late. SHE'S JERSEY TUFF established an inside stance shortly after the start, advanced on the leaders
along the backstretch, trekked the two path into the homestretch, then floated out near the eighth pole to rally mildly for the show. GHOST BAYOU rushed
form outset and set the pace in concert as the inner rival through the half, rated on even terms at upper stretch, but was unable to fend off foes in final
furlong. CUPID'S MUSIC showed reserve in the early going and swung four wide around the first turn, trekked the two path into the homestretch, then
altered lanes nearing the eighth pole while under urging and improved placing with a good response. SKY ROCKER was unable to sustain bid after flashing
early foot and setting the pace in tandem as the outside rival of two abreast through the opening half. CHA CHA DANCER tucked to the inside to save
ground shortly after the start, gave chase from mid pack, and finished evenly. CLAUDETTE HEIR trailed the field through the opening half before passing
tiring rivals in closing strides. ORNATELY came up empty in the homestretch after looming on the heels of the pacesetting duo from a two wide stance
through the opening half. BACK IN CHARGE settled into mid pack and rated between rivals around the opening bend and along the backstretch, was boxed
in at the halfway point, lost ground to front runners around the final turn, and lacked a needed rally in latter stages. KOLKATA was unhurried from outset,
trekked the three path through both bends, and lacked a serious bid. HOT SUMMER DREAM was unhurried from the outset, closed gap on leaders by
travelling four wide along the backstretch, trekked wide at upper stretch, and faded in closing strides.
