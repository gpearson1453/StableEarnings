Footnotes
STRIKING MOON was hustled early, took command on the turn and from the three path through the stretch was much the best. STRONG ENDING settled
off the pace, had a mild gain on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for place. CRAFTY CONQUEST was in touch and a factor
on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. JACK BEANSTALK was unhurried early and roused on the turn but from the eight path
at the top of the stretch was no real threat. SUMMER RETREAT was away alertly and forced the pace on the turn but from the three path at the top of the
stretch had nothing left. MOBILIZER was in range early but chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

BAIT N SWITCH was off slow, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch edged clear. DON'T STOP DREAMIN was hustled early
and dueled on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. VOYANT was away alertly and had a slim lead on the
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch gave way. HALF TO RELOAD was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the eight path at the
top of the stretch had no late kick. ARTIE'S ALL IN broke poorly and showed little in a dull effort.

was unhurried early, roused from the inside on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for place. JUSTIN'S WAY was hustled early,
headed on the turn and gave way. ACTION POINT settled off the pace and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed
more. SEVEN IS A BREEZE was checked early, showed little and from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no impact. WILBERFORCE showed
speed from the outside but chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

early pace, dueled on the far turn and had the lead in mid stretch but failed to hold. ASHWICKEN was off the pace, had a mild gain on the far turn and from
the four path at the top of the stretch was up for show. MIGHTY PELE set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the far turn but gave way. NGABE was
in mid pack and hustled along on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. GOGO GABRIEL was unhurried early and
roused from the inside on the far turn but had no rally. GOOD SKIP INDEED was in tight early, trailed the field on the far turn and was not a factor. LADY
OF THE FORT was in range but chased on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. AMEN TO THAT had no speed and
saved ground on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no impact.

Footnotes
DIAMOND HEIST tracked the early leaders, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch drew clear. EIN WAHRER SOLDAT was
hustled early and a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. BUSTA GROOVE showed speed from the
inside and had a clear lead on the turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. TONKA WAKAN was unhurried early and roused from
between foes on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. OPEECHEE was away alertly and raced evenly on the turn but from
the seven path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. LE GRAND GARCON was well back, trailed the field on the turn and was never in contention. GET
READY SET FIRE was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort. ONCEUPONASERENADE was off slow and saved ground on the turn but had no
impact.
