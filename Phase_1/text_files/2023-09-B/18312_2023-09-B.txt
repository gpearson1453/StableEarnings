Footnotes
LIGHTLINE pressed the pace for the first half mile from two wide, took command in the final bend, easily opened a clear advantage and widened down the
lane while being kept to task as much best. HONEST OPINION tracked the pacesetters from a clear pocket down the backside, rallied steadily through the
turn and down the lane to be second best. MR DISCOUNT broke alertly to set the pace into the first turn, was pressured on the pace to the far turn, could
not go with the winner when challenged and weakened through the lane. COMPANY YOU KEEP slow early to be the distant trailer, picked up momentum
approaching the final bend and found his best stride in the lane to mount a belated rally. NEW BERN well placed for the first half mile and lacked a closing
response. UNION RUN saved ground along the fence, was set to an early drive and failed to mount a rally. MERLIN'S MAGIC was never a threat.
INTOLERABLE chased the leaders from three wide down the backside and was through early.

Footnotes
JINGLE prompted the pace through the first turn, made a bid on the far turn from two wide in a drive to engage the leader, dueled with that one in upper
stretch and drew clear down the lane. THAT KHENNY set a well rated pace to the far turn, responded willingly when challenged midway on the turn, could
not go with the winner and finished well to be a clear second best. UNDISMAYED made a move from between horses down the backside to launch a three
wide bid into the turn under a drive and failed to sustain his bid into the lane finishing evenly. LOOK AWAY slow early to trail down the backstretch and
made a steady gain from the rear of the field through the final bend and down the stretch. GOLD BUCKLE tracked the pace from four wide to the far turn
and failed to gain ground. BLOOD MOON saved ground into the first turn while prominently placed and faded to be no threat. WEEKEND IN COURT well
placed along the rail to the far turn and weakened. FEVER TEMPLE was never a factor.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT WEST stalked the pace to the top of the lane, cut the corner turning for home and prevailed in a drive up the fence. FIRE BABY tracked the
pace down the backside from three wide, engaged the leader midway on the turn, dueled with that one in upper stretch, shook off the pacesetter and was
out-finished in the drive in a game effort. MANTA REY unhurried to be at the back of the back to the head of the stretch and made a belated rally down the
stretch to gain the show. PATTON'S WAR pressed the early pace, assumed command entering the turn, dueled to upper stretch and weakened late in the
drive. BLOCKED made a mild bid in the turn and flattened out as no threat. FIRST CROWNED flashed brief speed to lead for a quarter and came up empty.

ALL JOKES ASIDE stalked the pace from the fence to the turn, waited in hand for racing room through the turn, tipped out to the clear at the head of the
lane and wore the pacesetter down inside the final hundred yards. GHENT pressed the early pace from two wide, took command in the turn, opened a clear
advantage to mid-stretch and could not hold on. INDIGO RICH unhurried to be near the back of the pack, saved ground along the fence and rallied well up
the rail to be gaining late. BAILEYS RUN rated off the pace to the turn, rallied six wide at the head of the lane and made bid from the middle of the track to
just miss the show. VELOCIMO sped to the early lead under constant pressure while on the rail and faded through the lane. ROCKET DOCKET trailed for
the first half mile and passed weaker rivals down the lane. LEO'S ROAR tracked the leaders to the turn in striking distance, rallied from between horses in
the turn to threaten and flattened out coming home. BINGE rated in mid-pack, commenced a bid late in the turn while fanned five wide and finished evenly.
YOLO SANTIAGO raced wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CHIMES pressed the pace for a quarter mile, assumed command in the turn, cleared in upper stretch and drew off unchallenged as much best. SNUGGLER
stalked the pacesetters from the rail through the turn and finished well to be second best. C F V TU BRUTUS unhurried to be near the back of the field and
made a steady advance through the lane to gain the show. ENCHANTED MELODY saved ground through the turn and made mild bid in the stretch.
ALWAYS BLOSSOM dueled on the lead to the top of the lane and weakened through the stretch while drifting out. MYGALJUSTICE raced mid-pack from
three wide, angled wider turning for home and showed some late interest. SURLEY prominently placed tracking the leaders from two wide in the turn and
faded in the drive. MRSINATRAGLORYLADY was never a threat while passing tiring rivals in the lane. ANGELSNDISGUISE well placed in the early going
and tired. SHINY SHOES was never a factor.

Footnotes
STORMY WAGER set the pace into the first turn, opened a well measured lead while well rated, responded to all challenges and held the closers safe in a
well handled ride. SKIPPINJUSTICE unhurried early to trail, patiently waited through the far turn, angled wide turning for home and closed well to gain the
place. DASH OF SIMPLICITY tracked the leader from the fence through the final bend, cut the corner and rallied up the rail but could not close the gap.
SPOTTY SHOWERS stalked the pace from three wide to the far turn, was set to a drive to loom in upper stretch and hung down the lane. CHELSEA'S
STRENGTH rated in mid-pack within striking distance, was called upon at the quarter pole and failed to respond. SWIFT TEMPLE was never a threat.
BELGIAN BLUE prompted the pace for three quarters and stopped in the far turn.

Footnotes
BEREA broke alertly to take command from the gate, set a well measured pace, responded when called upon turning for home and was geared down at the
wire having been unchallenged. SHANGHAI EXPRESS reserved off the pace for the first half mile, circled wide turning for home and closed well belatedly to
be second best. QUEEN D stalked the pacesetter through the turn, mounted a bid in upper stretch and kept on willingly to hold the show. AJIC JAY rated in
mid-pack down the backside while four wide, mounted a four wide rally through the turn and kept grinding down the lane. QUITE WHIMSICAL slow early to
trail and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. D' KITTEN well placed to track the leaders and failed to mount a closing rally. LILMISS SASSYPANTS chased the
pacesetter through the turn and weakened down the stretch. TRIP CHARGE was never threat.

Footnotes
D'ORO'S WISH settled in hand down the backside, rallied from between horses through traffic in the turn, angled around stopping rival turning for home
putting rival in tight quarters, ran the leader down in deep stretch and pulled clear. SCOTTY'S ON EDGE stalked the pace to the head of the lane, assumed
command in upper stretch and was out-finished late in the drive in a good effort. JOVA slow early to trail, rallied turning for home four wide while splitting
rivals and finished willingly. AZZARO STEEL rated in mid-pack down the backside, rallied in the turn, was fanned six wide at the head of the lane while
gaining and evened out down the stretch. A FEW TOO MANY trailed turning for home and passed weaker rivals in the lane. BONNIE BILL tracked the pace
from three wide in the turn, was forced further out when closing rival angled around a stopping pacesetter and flattened out in the drive. ORO AZTECA set
the pace while dueling from the rail and tired in the lane. SPOKE dueled from two wide on the lead to the top of the stretch and stopped abruptly causing
traffic problems. THE RIDER OF BONNIE BILL CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE HEAD OF THE STRETCH,
UPON REVIEW BY THE STEWARDS NO CHANGE WAS MADE.

Footnotes
SPELTERINI unhurried in the early going while settling in hand, steadily gained ground up the rail to the head of the stretch, tipped out for the drive, collared
the pacesetter in mid-stretch and drew away. SIMPLY COMPLICATED stalked the pace from three wide to be well positioned turning for home, went evenly
through the lane and surged in the final strides to gain the place. ARMY GIRL sped to the lead shortly from the gates, repelled a challenge in the turn to be
clear turning for home and weakened down the lane. SUPER CHRISTIE bobbled a few strides from the gate nearly unseating the rider, raced up the fence
to be in striking distance into the turn, was taken up in the turn when impeded by rival, was gathered up again, angled to the clear coming home and finished
willingly. KATERINA PETROVA raced at or near the rear of the field most of the way and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. LITTLE HOT MESS tracked the
pace in the early going, weakened in the turn dropping to the fence impeding a rival and lacked a closing response. SWEET SASSY PANTS pressed the
pace for a half and stopped.
