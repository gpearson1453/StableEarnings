Footnotes
SMACKZILLA pressed the early pace from a three wide stance, maintained that line into upper stretch, was in concert for command at the head of the
stretch, and finished with courage to be pulling away from all rivals at the end. SHARP AS DAMASCUS earned the place with strong late kick after settling
into the second flight and stalking the pacesetters from between rivals. PUMPED UP KICKS broke alertly and shared the pace along the backstretch,
travelled between rivals around the turn, was on the lead in tandem at upper stretch, then was outdueled in final sixteenth. SWORD OF GOLD rated off the
pace through the first call, trekked the four path through the turn, and improved placing in final strides with late interest. COUNTRY CAPER settled into the
second flight shortly after the start, took a wide journey around the turn, and finished willingly to jut miss the show. SONIC POSSE rushed from outset to
force the early pace as the inner most of rival of three abreast, trekked that inside line aorund the turn, rated close up at upper stretch, but failed to match
strides in closing portion of contest. PROMISE CODE lacked a needed rally after establishing an inside stance mid pack and saving ground around the
bend. ABES DAY showed reserve from the start, trailed the field through the bend, and passed a tiring rival in late strides. NIGHT VISION was unhurried
from outset, chased frontrunners around the turn from a two path stance, then could not run down leaders in final furlong.

Footnotes
OKIE ATTITUDE pressed the early pace from a two wide pose, gained command near upper stretch and proved best in final furlong. SO JORDAN rushed
from outset to gain first command and establish a ground saving stance, led the field around the bend, was headed at upper stretch, but was bested by that
rival in final sixteenth. MISS LONG LEGS was unhurried along he backstretch, angled out to take a five wide journey through the turn, and finished with the
best stride late to ear the show. GOSPEL B. HAVIOR rallied mildly to improve placing after an awkward break and coming away tardy. GOSPEL
FABULOUS settled into the second flight shortly after the start, chased the pacesetting duo from between rivals around the turn, then weakened in the final
furlong. PLENTY OF GOLD stalked the early pace as the widest of three abreast in the second flight through the first call, maintained that three wide pose
through the bend, then lacked a late kick to sustain the bid. SANDY CREEK broke alertly, trekked the inside while rating in the second flight along the
backstretch, then steadily faded inside the half pole. TINY FORTUNE was unhurried from outset, travelled widest of all at upper stretch and lost ground to
front runners while doing so.

Footnotes
OUR MOON PIE pressed the pace from a four wide pose, rated widest of all at upper stretch, and ran down leader in final furlong to earn the score in final
stride. RED DIRT RICH rushed from outset to establish a ground saving stance and assume first command, led the field into deep stretch, then was nailed
at the wire and forced to settle for the place. BOBWHITE BOBBY earned the show with a mild rally after showing early patience and travelling the three path
around the bend. DEN'S DYNASTY pressed the early pace from between rivals, was within striking distance at upper stretch, but gave way to dueling duo in
homestretch. MISSING CODE was unhurried from outset, trekked wide through the turn, and finished evenly. RATLIFF CITY came up empty and lacked a
needed rally after settling into mid pack along the backstretch, splitting foes at head of turn, and tucking to rail at upper stretch. A LOT OF HEAT showed
reserve along the backstretch, took a three path journey around the bend, and weakened in closing stages. COWBOY BRODY lacked a serious bid and
encountered an uneventful journey after being shuffled back early and trekking the four path. HOLCOMBE failed to threaten after coming away in a tardy
manner at the start. BAJA BOOGIE settled into mid pack and tucked to save ground shortly after the start before breaking stride and coming under restraint
near the three eighths pole. URIAH broke alertly, stalked the early pace from between foes, then steadily faded in the latter half of contest.

Footnotes
WILD EXPRESS rushed from outset, gained first command, established a ground saving stance, and led every step of way for a gate to wire score. MY
GIRL MELLY tucked to the rail shortly after the start to save ground around the first turn, angled out to be widest of all at upper stretch, was gaining on the
leader in the final furlong, but was forced to check at the sixteenth pole to avoid a fallen rider. COURTNEY FAY finished evenly after being unhurried in the
early stages and swinging to five wide at upper stretch. ROLLIN BLACKOUT showed patience from the start and tucked to save ground, then improved
placing with a mild rally. GET SERIOUS pressed the early pace from a four wide pose, was within striking distance at upper stretch while four wide, but was
forced to alter path at the sixteenth pole to avoid a fallen rider. BASKET CASE came up empty and failed to produce a late kick after settling into the second
flight and trekking four wide at upper stretch. HIGHWAY SIXTY ONE failed to threaten and passed tiring rivals after rating back through the opening half.
CHILLAXIFICATION rushed from outset to force the pacesetter through the opening half before fading rapidly in the homestretch. DOWNTOWN ABBY
lacked a needed rally after showing reserve from outset. OUTLINING settled into second flight shortly after the start, trekked the inside, rated on the heels of
the leader at upper stretch, was under a stiff drive, then lost rider at the sixteenth pole.
