Footnotes
CARA CARA took control from the onset, extended the advantage at will throughout the turn, was kept to the task in mid-stretch and convincingly drew
away in the late stages. OLYMPIC FENCER chased the frontrunner outside down the backstretch, could not match strides with pacesetting winner running
on the turn and determinedly finished up to the wire holding for second. WINYAH BAY stalked four deep on the outside, co-trailed at the half, was roused
four wide outside runners at the quarter pole and closed in widest of runners to capture third in the end. REMEMBERING RHODA was checked between
horses at the five eighths marker, co-trailed inside at the half, shifted three wide at the quarter pole under a drive, angled inwards to the rail straightening out
for home and willingly ran on the fence to be on the fringes. LIVIN ON LUV hopped slightly at the break, regrouped to track in the second flight outside down
the back straight, was hard ridden midturn making little progress, put in a mild run four wide in upper stretch and evened out in the final furlong. PLUS
POWER tracked the top two down the backside running on the rail, was scrubbed on for more midway on the turn, shifted out to the three path turning for
home to be in the hunt for a small piece of the prize but retreated between horses at the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
BLAST IN THE SNOW switched out heading into the turn, advanced outside five wide on that bend, struck the lead about the three-sixteenths, drifted in
past the furlong marker while clear and continued to edge away. EL COHETE stalked the early pace from outside, went four wide on the turn, bid in upper
stretch, was overtaken by an outside foe, steadied slightly when that one came in nearing the sixteenth, was second best. MIGHTY SEA stumbled at the
start, settled at the back, fanned seven wide, gained some late. SILVER SMOKE was quick to the lead and set the pace in the clear racing just off the
inside, weakened in the stretch. MOON OVER EGBERT raced off the pace three wide through the turn coming out a bit for the drive and ran on with mild
late interest. AGILE DANCER raced near the inside and failed to menace. FIELD HOCKEY stalked just off the leader racing three wide, drifted a bit in the
stretch while weakening, faded. SPEEDY PAL chased from inside, had no late response. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF EL COHETE
AGAINST BLAST IN THE SNOW ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
JAYHAWK hopped slightly on the break, rated kindly two wide outside down the backstretch, started to take closer order advancing three wide with five
sixteenths to go, loomed the only threat four wide at the top of the lane, took over the lead at the sixteenth pole and was drawing away at the finish. ROAD
TO WATER was fractious in the gate prior to the start, prompted outside down the backstretch, began to edge away from the early speed foe midway on the
turn, braced for the outside challenge by the stablemate in upper stretch, was collared by the winner at the sixteenth pole when tiring but had enough left to
just hold safe for second best crossing the line. VITALITY stalked three deep outside horses co-trailing at the half, was under a ride three wide at the quarter
pole beginning to lengthen stride, closed outside in the four path down the lane on the wrong lead throughout but finished up well to just miss getting up late
for the place share. THEFRONTIERSMAN tracked the engaging pair down the back straight on the inside, was roused but could not match strides with the
eventual winner that was on his outside at the five sixteenths marker and rallied some down the lane showing late interest between foes to get up for a
minor role in the end. FIFTY B M G had a slim lead down the backside, was scrubbed on trying to maintain position midway on the turn, could no keep up to
the two leaders in upper stretch and weakened on the rail in the final furlong. EAT FOOD EVERYDAY trailed the field down the backside, caught up to the
pack inside at the half, made little impression running inside through the turn and could not get involved down the stretch.

Footnotes
HANK OLLIE dueled outside a rival on the turn racing about two to three wide, took command about the five-sixteenths, moved clear in the stretch and held
sway. VIVID VIXEN settled off the pace, rallied inside in upper- to mid-stretch coming out late for room, was second best. MOMENT OF PEACE inherited
the lead from a rival bearing out after the opening three-sixteenths, set the tempo into the turn, was engaged by an outside rival dueling with that one,
yielded only grudgingly and kept on to hold show honors. KILLARY settled off the pace raced in behind foes three then four wide on the turn, came out
seven deep at the top of the stretch, rallied outside and bumped a rival late. LOBBY BAR settled at the back early, advanced outside three to five wide
through the turn, gained some but needed more and was bumped nearing the wire. STORMIN DAVE was carried out numerous paths by a rival heading up
the backstretch before finally being taken back and angled back in, raced three to four wide stalking the pace, had no late bid. MO TOURIST raced inside
just off the rail, failed to rally. AIR FORCE RESERVE raced keenly between runners against the rider's restraint and on heels heading into the turn, went two
to three wide on that bend, tired. ARMALINE went straight to the lead but was getting out badly early, was not a factor thereafter, crossed the finish and
walked off.

SIESTA BEACH chased two wide in the beginning, tracked the contesting duo with rivals on either side through the turn, loomed four wide straightening out
for the drive, took the lead at the seventy yard pole, drifted outwards driving to the finish and held safe by a narrow margin at the wire. VALYRIAN SKY
tracked the leaders between down the backside, was shuffled back into the turn losing positions, rallied to be full of run at the furlong marker, shifted outside
to the five path late and could just not get there in time. BANKINGONAMIRACLE assumed command down the backside in the beginning, was pressured
outside setting the pace around the bend, fought on stubbornly when headed at the top of the stretch and gamely held for third at the wire. FAIRWAY TO
HEAVEN had a poor start, trailing down the backside, began to pick up runners going around rivals three wide three furlongs from the wire, swung outside
widest in the five path for the drive and surged late to just miss closing in for show. IM A SOUPERMAN settled in mid-pack in the early going, made an early
move splitting horses to chase the leader at the half, pressed the pace on the turn, dueled outside for the front turning for home and faltered at the sixteenth
pole. HE SHOOTS HE WINS was away slowly to begin, recovered to be tucked behind the pacesetter at the half, tracked the contesting pair on the rail in
the turn, was roused trying to keep pace at the quarter pole, in range of the leaders on the fence turning for home but stalled in deep stretch. RED ENSIGN
prompted four deep on the outside down the back straight, tracked three wide outside rivals through the turn to be in the mix for a share at the top of the
stretch, could not find more and tired in the final sixteenth. CANADIAN DADDY stalked near the rear in the three path down the backstretch, could see the
field saving ground on the turn and had little give on the fence down the lane.

Footnotes
SUPER SICILY was quickly clear, set the pace, drifted out turning for home, met the challenge of a rival near the furlong marker, held that one at bay. PARK
PLACE stalked the eventual winner from outside while kept wide, went four deep on the turn, bid nearing the furlong marker but was turned back and held at
bay. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA settled mid-pack inside, saved ground, fought on to get the nod for show. TOWN'S WARRIOR bumped a rival lightly at the
start, tracked in behind moving up heading to the turn and racing in the two to three path, needed more and lost the nod for show. TIMES A BREEZE settled
outside at the back, moved in a bit in mid-stretch and was flying late but with far too much left to do. KID MARVELOUS stalked from outside five wide on the
turn, had no extra. THIS DUDE A BREEZE was a bit hard to load, got away slowly and was lightly bumped, settled at the back, came out a bit for the drive,
rallied too late. LAST MONARCH raced outside mid-pack, moved out from four to seven wide on the turn, drifted in a bit in the stretch, kept on evenly.
CINNAMON BITS advanced mildly two to three wide and between runners while ridden along three furlongs out, faded in the stretch. DARE TO BE KING
chased from between runners mid-pack, retreated and faded.

Footnotes
ZIPPY GIZMO was bumped outside plus squeezed between foes on the break to trail inside down the backstretch, patiently waited seeing the field saving
ground on the turn, found a seam in the three path at the top of the lane starting a run, found another gear bursting between horses at the furlong marker
and got up in the shadow of the wire for a well timed win. BRAVE DANCER settled outside rivals co-trailing in the early stages, was gaining momentum
three wide around runners with five sixteenths to go, began to extend his stride in the five path widest at the top of the stretch, closed in under left handed
urging at the eighth pole to battle up front but was just outfinished late by the winner at the line. SUMMER COMMANDER had an ideal set up, all alone,
watching the dueling pair contest the lead through the turn, pounced to the front in the three path three sixteenths from the wire, fought on determinedly but
faded late between rivals nearing the finish to hold for third in the end. BEARING DOWN settled inside mid-pack down the back straight, shifted out three
wide three furlongs from the finish gaining mildly on the leaders, was in the hunt in the four path straightening for the drive and willingly ran to the wire for a
minor role behind. MEKO MAKEE shifted outside off the fence midway down the backstretch to prompt the issue outside, took over control on the turn
outside, began to edge away from the early pace foe with three furlongs to go, was collared outside three sixteenths from home, offered little resistance and
tired inside the final sixteenth. YACHT BOY broke inwards at the start, cleared to the rail for the lead down the backside, was relegated to the chasing role
on the inside through the turn, roused with three eighths to go trying to keep pace, had little response and backed away on the fence in upper stretch.

Footnotes
STATE OF MIND tracked in behind near the inside saving some ground, advanced inside a rival while coming out three wide past the three-eighths, put to
stout urging at the top of the stretch, struck the lead past the eighth pole and edged away. LADY MOONSHINE broke in just a bit, went to the front, set the
pace racing off the rail, was no match for the winner but second best. BUTTERED TOAST settled outside at the back two to three wide, advanced outside
foes three to four wide on the far turn, was no match for the top pair but secured show honors. AMI'S LINK veered in at the start, saved ground, was unable
to threaten. FRANKIE'S GIRL stalked the pace three deep, steadily retreated.

Footnotes
WAR PAINTER was unhurried, trailing down the backside, could still see the field inside on the turn, found her stride gaining on rivals with five sixteenths
from home, shifted outside to the four path finding clear room to close in, rallied with horses on each side and got up near the wire for a well timed measured
win. OLIVIA ROSE took this field down the back straight, set the fractions inside running through the turn, was headed outside at the top of the stretch,
repelled the early challenge and gamely fought inside trying to fend off the closing winner late. FOURFIFTYFOUR tracked inside down the backstretch
through the turn, was under a drive with five sixteenths to run, made little headway in upper stretch, never gave in down the lane and fought stubbornly to
the finish capturing third in a gritty performance. HURRICANE CLAIR bore out badly at the start, recovered to track outside down the backstretch, continued
watching the front pair in the second flight outside on the turn, posed a threat widest in the five path turning for home but stalled with a furlong to go for a
minor share. NEVER SILENT was content to sit off the frontrunner just outside down the backstretch, applied mild pressure outside to the frontrunner
through the turn, bid for the lead in the four path in hand straightening out for the drive, was set down between horses in upper stretch, could not find more,
was repelled by the leader and stopped at the furlong marker.

HAVE A SOUPER DAY was nestled on the inside watching the top two down the backside, was scrubbed on the fence for more run at the quarter marker,
shot up the rail at the eighth pole and was drawing away crossing the finish line. STAR SIGN settled in the middle of the pack inside at the half, waited
patiently in hand running on the turn, was blocked behind a wall of runners in the three path at the top of the lane, shifted inwards to the rail at the seventy
yard pole and shot through late to win the foursome battle for the place share at the finish. HE'S FULLY LOADED pressed the pace inside down the
backstretch, had a narrow lead on the rail midpoint on the turn, opened up mildly at the top of the stretch, stubbornly fought on clinging to the lead with an
eighth to run and never gave in, holding for third in a tight four horse photo for the runners up share at the finish. POSEIDON STEEL was forced in at the
break, travelled near the back of the pack in the early going, started to circle runners under a ride at the quarter pole, swung out to the eight path with
momentum driving to the wire and was closing in through the stretch to be involved in the quartet finish for second in the end. RELOAD'S RASCAL was
squeezed on the break, recovered quickly, improving down the back straight awa getting better position, rated kindly in hand behind the contesting front pair
on the turn, pounced in the three path in upper stretch to bid for the lead, needed more late, stalled nearing the wire and was on the losing end of a four
horse photo for place at the finish. CAUSIN' MAYHEM was away alertly to begin, settled in midfield down the backside, was urged for more three wide with
five sixteenths remaining, shifted out to the six path for the stretch run, mildly ran to the finish but could not get involved in the end. RED LINE OVERDRIVE
broke inwards at the start, recovered to prompt three wide down the backstretch, was nudged three wide outside foes tracking the front two, three furlongs
from the wire, had a chance if good enough in the four path for a share of the prize turning for home, levelled out at the furlong marker and could not be a
factor at the wire. TAKE CHARGE SOUSI was off a step slow to begin, trailed outside down the back straight, rallied three wide around foes at the back of
the pack three furlongs from home, was in with a chance not too far off the leaders eight wide turning for home and came up empty in the final furlong.
MAAKWA set the fractions down the backstretch, was headed inside midway on the turn, was roused for more fighting up front between rivals at the quarter
pole, could not maintain position, retreated in upper stretch and galloped across the finish. ADELAIDE COURT stalked near the rear in the three path
climbing down the back straight, showed little interest when asked between rivals at the back of the field three furlongs from the finish and could not reach
contention driving to the line.
