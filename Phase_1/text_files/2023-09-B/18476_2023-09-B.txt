Footnotes
RED GUN a step slow through the turn lost ground to upper stretch firing late past mid track getting up in the final yards. KLIMT RIDE stalked the pace
rallying to engage between horses on the turn taking a late lead ceding to wide pressure. MY SONG BABY sharp to clear was hooked along the inside on
the turn gradually wearing down through the lane. ELEGGUA slow early saved ground to upper stretch finishing evenly. KEYSER was never involved.
ELUSIVE QUESTION pressed three deep on the turn then tired the final eighth. SECRET CAMELOT trailed throughout.
