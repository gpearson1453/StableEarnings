WORK IT dueled for command from outside, shook free around the bend, widened in the lane and was ridden out to the wire. SCREAMING VIRGINIA sat
off the pace, went two wide into the turn, eased out to entered the lane four wide, showed a mild response when asked and held the place.
PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL chased at the back early, trailed on the inside into the turn, steered out exiting the bend, rallied and missed the place.
PHAROAHS LIST stalked off the rail, rounded the bend three wide and flattened out. DETAILS MATTER dueled from inside into and around the bend, failed
to kick on with the winner late on the turn, came out in the lane and weakened. DAWSON broke a step slow, got shuffled back early, moved up into range
stalking from inside and weakened in the lane.

ROSE GIRL broke out and brushed ZZYZX, set the pace on the inside then two wide into the lane, asked right-handed at the three-sixteenths pole and
edged away. BELLA BABY broke out, chased two wide into the turn, took aim three wide into the stretch, could not summon the needed late kick in the final
furlong but was clearly second best. ZZYZX got brushed from inside at the start, tracked three then four wide around the bend, churned on down the lane
and finished a clear third. PARCO coaxed from the gate, chased a bit off the rail then two wide into the stretch and flattened in the stretch.

Footnotes
ROAD OF LOVE broke well and dueled for a bit but could not keep up early with MY BROTHER MIKE, chased that rival in the two path through the turn,
drew alongside past the quarter pole, cleared at the three-sixteenths pole and held well under urging. BLUEGRASS RYDER tracked near the inside then
switched out, rounded the bend three wide, finished willingly through the lane but had to settle for second best. MY BROTHER MIKE dueled from outside
then cleared past the nine-sixteenths pole and crossed over, set the pace along the inside to the stretch, challenged at the top of the lane, relinquished the
lead to ROAD OF LOVE, flattened in the furlong grounds but managed to save the show. ACCELERAY chased three to four wide around the turn and
lacked a rally. NUMBER ONE SON chased four wide into the turn, angled down to the inside around the bend and lacked further response. RANGER JOE
was off slow and lost his path at the start, became hard to ride trailing the field, continued to fight the rider in upper stretch and never got involved.

and held well. HANDR'SDREAM bumped leaving the gate, forwardly placed up the backstretch, navigated the turn two wide, chased after the winner
willingly down the lane but could not summon the needed late kick. NOLONGERAHOBBY tracked off the rail, came four wide into the lane and was along
for the show. EQUIPO A raced up close from outside, rounded the turn four then three wide and flattened in the lane. MY MAN BAGS got bumped leaving
the gate, forwardly placed four wide into the first turn, exited the bend three wide and weakened. DEBT MONGER got brushed and put in a bit tight at the
start, stalked from inside through the turn and weakened.

SO I'M TOLD away quickly at the start, dueled inside SOUL OF MIDNIGHT, put away that rival past the three-eighths pole, came off the rail to show the
way three wide into the lane and held safely. GALOPING CAT stalked the pace from inside, saved ground through the turn, moved off the rail in the lane
and outfinished THE KEY IS UNITY for second. THE KEY IS UNITY chased five to six wide on the turn, chased outside GALOPING CAT down the lane and
got outkicked for the place honors. SOUL OF MIDNIGHT bumped at the start, dueled outside SO I'M TOLD to the turn, failed to go on with that rival past the
three-eighths pole, exited the bend four wide and weakened. TIGER'S ARROW bumped SOUL OF MIDNIGHT, chased four then five wide before angling
down to the three path on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
RED CROSS KNIGHT raced up close outside the top pair, chased three wide through the turn, bid between at the top of the stretch, dueled with PERFECT
D in the final furlong and dug in late to prevail. PERFECT D brushed leaving the gate, showed speed then was taken in hand and raced keenly, looked to
make a run on the turn but lacked room in traffic, tipped out and bid three wide at the top of the lane, took over shortly after, dueled with RED CROSS
KNIGHT in the furlong grounds and finished gamely in defeat. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL chased four deep into the turn, remained four wide into the lane, offered
a challenge in upper stretch and flattened to third. DR. TROUTMAN broke a step slow, went up to duel from inside into and around the bend, could not kick
on with the leaders at the top of the stretch, churned on while moving off the inside and earned a minor award. DIVINE FEMININE took a bump from inside,
chased three wide into the turn, angled five wide into the drive and lacked a rally. FAST PER SE away quickest while brushing outer rival, dueled outside
DR. TROUTMAN, inched ahead around the bend, cleared inner rival into the stretch but was soon challenged at the quarter pole from outer rivals and
weakened once overtaken. TEMBO broke out and bumped, trailed five wide into the turn, six wide into the lane and failed to menace.
