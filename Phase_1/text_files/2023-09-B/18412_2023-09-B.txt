Footnotes
MISCHIEF JOKE showed good speed, vied in the two path on the turn, took the lead inside the seven-sixteenths pole, moved clear at the five-sixteenths
pole, responded well when shaken up lightly in upper stretch, was kept to the task under a mild hand-ride while drifting out some until inside the furlong
marker then was eased up while much the best. PERLIANO was hustled from the start, chased the pace, saved ground on the turn and earned the place.
OFFICER DERICK broke out some at the start, showed speed on the outside, vied in the four path on the turn, lost touch with the winner late on that bend
and weakened. FRATELLINO stumbled at the start but broke with the field, was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten.
MAMA'S DREAM moved up after the start and showed speed, dropped back late on the backstretch, fell further back in the three path on the turn and
retreated.

the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive kept to task. SHERIFF BIANCO coaxed from the gate, chased three wide down the
backstretch before tucking along the inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on to
secure the place honors. UNCLE MOONLIGHT chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. BABY YODA broke in at the start trading a
bump with BOLD ENDEAVOR, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide for home, weakened in the
stretch. BOLD ENDEAVOR broke out at the start trading a bump with BABY YODA, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. KINETIC SKY coaxed from the start, chased four to five wide
down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn placed to coaxing midway, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DUKE OF HAZZARD (FR) tracked the pace along the inside, got let out swinging two to three wide into upper stretch, angled in to the two path just outside
the eighth pole finding a seam to rally on through, seized command nearing the sixteenth marker, then dug in gamely to fend off the runner up. KURAMATA
(IRE) tracked the pace two to three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive to be along
willingly for the place honors. CALL ME HARRY forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got set down spinning three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive running on to secure the show honors. WINFROMWITHIN coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, got
let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a host of pursuers and was collared nearing the sixteenth pole, then kept on to
the finish. MAIN EVENT just off the inside tracking from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered
no response. TUT'S REVENGE tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, weakened
in the late stages. CAZADERO saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, trailed
throughout. Please note due to a timing issue, the half mile, the three quarters and the seven-eighths splits were hand timed.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF THE MUD (IRE) went to the front, showed the way under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, responded well when asked
near the quarter-pole, shook clear into upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. MATERIAL WITNESS was rated just behind the leader on the inside,
drafted along the rail on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased the winner in the stretch and earned the place. YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE was off
slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved up under urging, went around the turn in the two path and got up for the show. NYXED was urged along off
the pace, saved ground on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, came out near the three-sixteenths and bothered a rival then improved position.
CATSKILL HUMOR was one of four to break a step slow, settled on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response.
MADAKET'S ARROW settled off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed
kick. MILLIE JEAN pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and came up empty.
DREAMING OF MO broke a step slow, settled towards the rear, went two to three wide on the turn and was no factor. SEAWITCH was urged along towards
the back, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. OOLONG HAI (IRE) tossed her head while tugging rankly on the bit coming to the nine-sixteenths,
went three wide while let out on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and capitulated. ISOLA (IRE) bumped with a foe while off a step slow, settled in the
back half of the field, went two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, checked off the heels of NYXED when that foe came out near
the three-sixteenths and failed to respond. FANCY STAX bumped with an opponent while off a step slow, angled in at the back near the half-mile pole,
saved ground on the turn and failed to impact. FOLLOWING THE FINISH, THE RIDER OF ISOLA REQUESTED A HOLD ON THE RACE. AFTER THE
STEWARDS' REVIEW, NYXED WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED ELEVENTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH

Footnotes
EXACT ESTIMATE saved ground on the first turn, moved out entering the backstretch, was rated on the outside, ranged up three wide on the far turn, was
asked near the quarter-pole, rallied to the lead into upper stretch then kicked clear, remained clear under a drive into the final sixteenth and just held under
strong urging. FREEDOM TRAIL traveled around the opening bend in the two path, settled on the outside, moved from the two path to the four path on the
far turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed fast to just miss. DAUNT bumped with a rival at the start,
rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused three then four wide on the far turn, chased the winner in the stretch and finished
willingly for the show. FRANCESCO CLEMENTE (IRE) was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went around the first turn in the two path, was
reserved at the rear, raced two then three wide on the far turn, was roused five wide into the stretch then moved further out and improved position. TIDE OF
THE SEA brushed with a rival after the start, went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked on the far turn, lost the lead under a drive into
upper stretch and gave way. GOOD SKATE bumped with a rival at the start, was taken under a tight hold early, saved ground while reserved off the pace,
moved to the two path near the five-sixteenths, came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. RONSTADT was reserved on the
inside, saved ground through the far turn, cut the corner behind a foe into the stretch, was roused near the three-sixteenths and failed to rally. ALTERNATE
REALITY established a forward position early, went around the first turn in the two path, tracked the leader on the outside, chased in the two path on the far
turn and came up empty.

MARIACHI coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive and held well and clear to the finish
to prevail. ZEEBEAR four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure
the place honors. RADIO RED got bumped at the start by PERFECT MUNNINGS, who broke outwards, chased six paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway, swung three to four wide for home, kept on to procure the show honors.
D'ONT LOSE CRUZ coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the
corner into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BREW PUB five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the
turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, went seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. HORN OF PLENTY was
leaning along the off side stall when the latch was sprung and brushed the gate to his right side getting away last and conceding three lengths to the front,
chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered three wide into upper stretch, weakened. BIG ENGINE bobbled at the break
conceding two to three lengths to the front, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing midway, continued just off the
inside into upper stretch and made no impact. PERFECT MUNNINGS broke out at the start bumping RADIO RED, showed brief speed five wide down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn and faded, swung five wide into upper stretch and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
ZAPRUDER bumped with a rival at the start, dropped from the four path to the two path on the first turn, settled towards the rear, went two then three wide
around most of the far turn then angled five wide, came six wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed well to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole
then moved clear under good handling to prevail. ATLANTA'S ACUNA angled in abruptly before the first turn, raced in the three path on that bend,
contested the pace on the outside, was urged in the two path on the far turn, shook clear outside the five-sixteenths, remained clear under a drive into the
final furlong but was overtaken while clear for the place. CHARMING JIM bumped hard with a rival at the start and was off slow, moved from the rail to the
two path on the first turn, settled at the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch, drifted in inside the furlong marker and
improved for the show. SCREW LOOSE bumped soundly with a foe at the start, was taken up some while put in tight quarters before the first turn, saved
ground while reserved off the pace, angled four wide late on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. PERFECT
OUTCOME was reluctant to load, bumped with an opponent at the start, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled just off the pace, was asked
while moving from the rail to the three path on the far turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and tired. FAST STUDY went three then two wide on
the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path on the far turn and failed to rally. IMPAZIBLE PRINCE bumped
with rivals on both sides at the start, angled in towards the rear, saved ground on the turns and was no factor. THATSMYBOXER broke in and bumped with
a foe, was bumped hard before the first turn then taken up, went two to three wide on the turns and came up empty. MYLES stumbled badly at the start then
bumped with an opponent, went five then four wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, went three then two wide on the far turn and failed to respond.
A LISTER was carried in on the opening straightaway then bumped hard with a rival and was taken up, went three to four wide on the first turn, stalked the
pace on the outside, dropped back four then five wide on the far turn and capitulated. SOMAMA BEACH was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on
the inside, dropped back nearing the five-sixteenths and faded. UTAMARO went around the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace,
came under pressure while two then three wide on the far turn and faltered.
