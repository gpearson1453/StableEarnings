Footnotes
THALBERG shuffled first turn, saved ground far turn, split horses cleared. SCHOOLMASTER (GER) unhurried early, widest run into stretch, gained head
bob. THE POINT ROAD outside first turn, stayed wide far turn, just missed. THE RED FOX saved ground while attending the pace to far turn, gutsy effort.
BIALYSTOCK spurted clear between horses into first turn, weakened far turn. TROY BOY good position to far turn, could not go on, gave in grudging late.
MR YETTIE off rail trip to far turn no late response. RAGING WHIRLWIND raced back to far turn, kept on with no late response in stretch. BACON between
horses down the backstretch, no late action in the lane. GOOD SOUL through early, dropped back readily. Race was hand timed due to a bad sensor on the
turf course, all turf races will be hand timed for the remainder of the meet. Acm
