Footnotes
RACE FOR DOUGH saved ground setting the pressured pace, drifted out leaving the three-sixteenths pole and was all out to prevail in a prolonged drive.
PROFESSIONAL GRADE settled early, moved up three-wide to disputed the issue before going a quarter mile and wasn't quite good enough in a game
effort. ALL SAINTS was unhurried early while racing two-wide, slipped through during the drive and finished fast. WINDY O K C was prominently placed
while racing four-wide on the turn but lacked a rally. TEXAS BBQ dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. WHY
TEXAS WHY prompted the early pace while racing two-wide and weakened. TAKE POINT was forwardly placed early racing along the inside and gave way
during the drive.

Footnotes
WRANGLERED vied with SWEET BAKER for the lead from along the inside, shook that one off entering the stretch to open a clear lead and maintained a
safe advantage. OUR CORNERSTONE stalked the pace while racing two-wide, angled out to be four-wide at the quarter pole and closed strongly. POP'S
BISCUIT was allowed to settle in stride early, moved up five-wide nearing the quarter pole to launch a bid and finished in a mild rally. TAG ME hopped
slightly at the start then saved ground tracking the pace but lacked a rally. SWEET BAKER broke out slightly to brush with HUNTER QUICK, then vied for
the lead from along the outside to the stretch and tired. SEDARIS settled in the middle of the field while racing three-wide on the turn came four-wide into
the stretch and gave way. HIT ONE OUT dropped back early while saving ground and was not a factor. HUNTER QUICK was brushed at the start, then
raced four-wide and failed to menace.

Footnotes
EURO TRACKING dueled for the lead from along the inside, responded when head, regained the lead nearing the eighth pole and prevailed in a stiff drive.
BLUEGRASS BREEZE was prominently placed while saved ground, angled out to be three-wide entering the stretch, caught EURO TRACKING at he
eighth pole but couldn't quite get by than one in a game effort. DUDE PERFECTA was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch, angled further out
during the drive and finished strongly. MAJOR GRIFFIN dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. SHELL
SHOCKER hopped slightly at the start after breaking a step slow, then rushed up between horses while two-wide to disputed the pace into the stretch and
weakened late. GRAYGHOSTGRANVILLE settled in the middle of the field while racing three-wide on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to
be a factor. GRAMI'S BOY dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, gained a slight advantage on the turn, then bore out badly at the quarter and finished
willingly when straightened. LOCK UP YOUR PETS was forwardly placed early while racing four-wide and tired.

CROOKED FELLOW saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged by COSMIC SOUL at the quarter pole and quickly drew clear.
SHADOWLESS was allowed to settle while racing three-wide and finished well for second in a steady effort. COSMIC SOUL bobbled at the start, then
moved up two-wide to stalk the pace, offered a bold bid nearing the quarter pole but was unable to sustain his bid and finished well for thnbird. RUSSIAN
TANK was reserved off the early pace, came two-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. SPECIAL MOMENT broke out shortly to drop well behind his field,
moved forward along the inside on the backstretch, angled out to be five-wide at the quarter pole but was unable to sustain his bid. SEND THE BOSS was
unhurried early while racing four-wide, came six-wide into the stretch and was not a factor.
