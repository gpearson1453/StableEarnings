Footnotes
GRANDDADDYLONGLEGS stalked the early speed from just outside, took over with two furlongs to go, drew off in the lane while kept to urging until the
final sixteenth. CHARLIE'S BEACH without early speed, saved ground, rallied two wide in the lane and split horses inside the final sixteenth to take over
second. FLYING CRICKET in contention from outside, floated out to path five entering the stretch, moved clear for second but could not sustain his bid late.
LONE RETURN chased from outside, angled in through the turn, took over third along the rail upper stretch then leveled off in the waning yards. UH OH
IT'S MAGIC chased two or three wide and had no late bid. UNDEFEATED CHAMP displayed early speed from inside, was overtaken with a quarter mile
left, floated out to path four entering the lane and steadily gave way.

Footnotes
DRAGGING MAIN soon had a clear lead, showed the way in hand from inside, was let out some into the second turn, under a drive through the lane and
was clearly the best. HOT CUPPA COFFEE prompted the pace from just off the inside, fanned out some for the stretch run, gradually drifted out as he
pulled away for second and held a straight path the final sixteenth. CHERRY ORCHARD gradually closed the gap from outside on the backstretch, moved
clear for third three wide on the second bend, stayed outside HOT CUPPA COFFEE into the lane, altered inside that one with a furlong to go, steadily
lugged in after that and narrowly held on for the show. RED ROIL bore in some just after the break, was settled inside, picked up his pace after a half mile,
saved ground taking the second turn, altered out for a clear path just after entering the last eighth and was closing in for third late. TEMPLE FOOL hesitated
at the start, progressed from inside, came off the rail some for the drive, altered in as CHERRY ORCHARD came close inside the last eighth and was
checked behind that one in the waning yards. GOD GUNS N GUTS chased while toward the outside, came into the stretch from path five and had no late
bid. LELAND JOHN raced in the second flight from outside but gave way from between rivals with three furlongs to go. There was a stewards' inquiry into
TEMPLE FOOL'S loss of action deep stretch and the rider of TEMPLE FOOL lodged an objection claiming interference from CHERRY ORCHARD nearing
the wire. After their review, the stewards disqualified CHERRY ORCHARD and placed him fifth.

Footnotes
BERTRADA rated off the early speed, commenced her bid along the rail on the turn, got through inside MY LADY SLEW into the lane, moved clear and
maintained full control under steady handling. PALAGO shared the lead outside MY LADY SLEW from the early going, came into the stretch from path
three, battled the latter for second and edged ahead for the place the final seventy yards. MY LADY SLEW disputed the pace off the rail but inside her rival,
saved ground on the bend, floated out some entering the stretch, fought to keep second but did not have enough late. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE without
early speed, also saved ground taking the turn and rallied belatedly the final furlong. WAR COLORS hesitated at the break, was hustled up between rivals,
reached contention two wide on the bend, fanned out some entering the lane, altered out for a clear path midstretch, had every chance but leveled off in the
waning yards. ZENCHUA SKY soon trailed, stayed widest of all and had no significant stretch response.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF MAYHEM quickly moved clear and took the inside, lengthened his lead while in hand on the backstretch, was roused with two furlongs to go
and maintained full control under steady urging in the stretch. SUPER SILVER was away slowly, gradually progressed from inside, began to angle out
nearing the quarter pole, came into the stretch from path three, drew clear for second, could not close the gap on the leader but was unchallenged for the
place. CHERNYAHOVSKIY raced in the second flight from just off the rail, was caught in tight quarters approaching the quarter pole, shuffled back, stayed
just off the inside as he gained third entering the stretch and began to wear down the final furlong. CAMPAIGN SPY gradually progressed from outside to
gain a striking position four wide midway on the second bend but leveled off for the drive. CHANGE DIRECTION void of speed, though urged along early,
chased from just off or along the rail, swung out widest for the stretch run and failed to have a significant response. GAGOOTS soon trailed, was also just off
or along the rail and had little to offer in the lane. SHOBIZ STAR in the second flight early just outside CHERNYAHOVSKIY, was also in close quarters
between rivals nearing the quarter pole and gave way soon after that.

Footnotes
KEEN RESPONSE bumped with MY KINDA TETON at the start, was settled just off the inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, split rivals two wide on
the second turn, fanned to path four into the lane, brushed with UNCLE O. G. upper stretch, vied for the lead from outside soon after and edged ahead in
time. PAYNT BY LETTERS vied for the lead from outside from the beginning, was four wide taking the first bend, angled in beside UNCLE O. G. on the
backstretch, moved clear on the second turn, was challenged from both sides upper stretch, fought gamely the last furlong but had to settle for second best.
MARCHING ORDERS settled from inside, also commenced his bid after a half mile, steadily progressed to vie for the lead upper stretch but gradually wore
down inside the last eighth. MY KINDA TETON bumped with KEEN RESPONSE at the break, chased from outside, lost ground five wide on the second
bend, angled in some entering the lane, gained a striking position, altered out some for a clear path inside the last eighth and failed to have the needed late
kick. THACKER FROMM chased from between rivals, lost ground four to six wide taking the second turn, reached contention upper stretch, lugged in with a
furlong to go and leveled off. UNCLE O. G. shared the early lead from inside, did not stay with PAYNT BY LETTERS on the second bend, swung out to path
three for the drive, was crowded briefly by KEEN RESPONSE upper stretch and gradually yielded between rivals. RIP IT RYAN reluctant to load, turned his
head just as the gate opened, chased from just off the inside, angled out widest in the stretch and had little to offer. SAFE chased the early speed from path
three, fanned out five wide into the lane, altered in trying to stay clear of THACKER FROMM near the eighth marker, was checked when his path
disappeared with a furlong to go, altered out awkwardly and steadily faded. LORD SHAFTESBURY displayed brief speed between rivals, did not stay close
while just off the rail on the backstretch, quit after a half mile and was allowed to coast through the stretch. There was a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run
but no action was taken after review.

Footnotes
RIGHT ON RICHIE soon had a clear clear, showed the way from inside, was roused on the second bend, floated out to path three for the stretch run,
steadily opened up on the rest and was kept to task to the wire. MILLARD'S SMILE settled early, commenced his bid along the rail after a half mile,
squeezed through two wide entering the lane and got up for second deep stretch. NULLARBOR raced closest to RIGHT ON RICHIE from just off the inside,
fanned outside the latter into the stretch, was no match for RIGHT ON RICHIE and began to wear down inside the last furlong. EMPTY HOLSTER void of
speed, though hustled along after the break, tried to progress between rivals after a half mile, was steadied while boxed in behind COPPER CROSSING
nearing the second bend, angled out through that turn, came five wide into the stretch, fought for third then leveled off in the late going. ROCKET
HOTSHOT bumped with TROY OUNCE at the start, soon trailed, picked up his pace just off the rail after four furlongs, altered out four wide upper stretch
and advanced belatedly between horses. LONESOME DREAM was a brief contender from inside, did not keep up on the backstretch, moved clear for third
on the second bend, drifted out slightly upper stretch, brushed with MILLARD'S SMILE and gradually faded. COPPER CROSSING chased midpack from
inside, angled out on the second turn, came four wide into the lane and had no late bid. STORM BORN advanced from outside on the first bend but began
to fade before finishing a half mile. TROY OUNCE bumped with ROCKET HOTSHOT at the break, was hustled up to race in contention outside
NULLARBOR but gave way between horses on the second turn.
