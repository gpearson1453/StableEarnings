Footnotes
DAYKRA sped to the lead shortly away from the gate, quickly opened a clear advantage and widened down the lane having never been challenged as much
best. LOONY stalked the pacesetter down the backside, could never close the gap on that one but finished willingly to be second best.
MONUMENTALJUSTICE tracked the leaders from mid-pack to the turn, split rivals with a mild bid at the quarter pole and finished well. STARLITE RUN
rated in mid-pack to the turn, circled up five wide and showed some late interest. MR NEGATIVITY chased the pace from three wide and lacked a closing
response. BIG ANCHOR raced near the rear of the field and passed weaker rivals in the stretch. LEA ANN'S PRINCESS slow early to be well behind the
pack and picked up ground late never having been a threat. SHOWDOWN JUSTICE showed brief speed to be prominent early and gradually gave way. T.
V. VICTORY was never a factor.

FOLLOW THE MONEY pressed the pace for five-eighths of a mile from two wide, took command at the head of the lane and repelled the runner-up down
the length of the stretch in a determined drive. RUN AWAY ROJO stalked the pace to the far turn, ranged up three wide nearing the quarter pole, engaged
the winner in upper stretch and could not get passed. HOBNOBIN GENERAL well placed tracking the leaders from the rail down the backstretch from
striking position, angled out four wide at the head of the lane and finished willingly while unable to gain on the top pair. WIN ME OVER set a pressured pace
through the far turn and weakened down the lane. TOUR THE MOON trailed most of the way and never menaced. BASSCOAT was never a threat.

LITTLE SASS broke alertly, pressed the pacesetter from two wide through the turn while hustled to keep the pressure on, continued to press the leader
through the lane and wore that one down in deep stretch to pull away. GREEN GRACE tracked the leaders through the turn and made a late, grinding rally
to pick up the place. PEGGY'S WAY set a pressured pace from the rail to mid-stretch and weakened in the final eighth. SCOOT ALONG went evenly
without ever posing a threat.

JUANCHO stalked the pace from two wide to upper stretch and finished well to wear the pacesetter down late in the drive and hold the closer safe. ROCK
THE RED unhurried for the first half mile, angled five wide turning for home and was gaining at the wire when closing with a belated rush. LUCKIES JOY
sped off to a clear lead through the turn and was worn down when tiring late in the lane. JENNY'S BEIGNET tracked the leaders for three-eighths, made a
mild bid in the turn and failed to close ground. BUMPY well placed along the fence in striking distance and failed to mount a rally. STICKER was finished
early.

KAYA'S HALO prompted the pace from three wide to the head of the lane, took command turning for home and drew off convincingly in the lane. CALL ME
PENNY stalked the dueling pacesetters through the turn, circled four wide to threaten at the top of the lane and finished well while second best. LITTLE
HOT MESS raced up from between rivals to duel on the lead to the quarter pole and kept on willingly through the lane to be best of the rest. HEAVENLY
RICH unhurried for the first three-eighths to be at the back of the main body and made a mild rally in the lane. VIOLET FLAME broke slow to be the distant
trailer and showed some late interest down the stretch. RUBY TAP pressed the pace from the rail to the turn and steadily faded to the rear.

Footnotes
WILDCATJUSTICE settled in hand to track the pace, waited behind a wall of horses through the turn, angled to the clear at the top of the lane and prevailed
in the drive in a well handled ride. AMAZINGNESS reserved off the pace down the backside, ranged up five wide midway on the final bend to engage the
leaders, took a brief lead in upper stretch and was outkicked to the wire in a game effort. LIEUTENANT KITTY stalked the leaders from the fence down the
backside, moved two wide to mount a rally from between rivals in the turn, lost position midway on the bend and re-rallied down the lane to be gaining late.
SKIPPINJUSTICE unhurried early to be at the rear of the field, gained ground to the pack into the far turn, angled wide at the top of the lane and made a
late rally. MYGALJUSTICE broke alertly to take the lead from the gate crossing the field to the first turn, set a pressured pace from the half mile pole,
responded well to all challenges to the head of the lane and weakened coming home. PRESCIENCE pressed the pace down the backside racing from
between rivals and faded in the turn. CLEVER KATE trailed most of the way and was never a threat. SIGNATURE STREET tracked the leaders from four
wide to the turn, mounted an early rally to be with the leaders and flattened out in the lane. AMERICA RULES was never a factor.

Footnotes
FROZEN SOLID sped up the fence to duel on the lead, shook clear of the presser turning for home and drew off down the lane as much best. ALBERTA
SUN pressed the pace from two wide to the head of the stretch, could not go with the winner but kept on well to be second best. FRANGO ELECTRICO
reserved off the early pace, angled wide in upper stretch and came on down the lane to gain the show. BEYOND PROPER trailed to the quarter pole and
passed weakened rivals in the lane. PRINCESS ELIN chased the pace from the fence and flattened out. POLKA POLENTA prompted the pace from three
wide and gave way in the lane.
