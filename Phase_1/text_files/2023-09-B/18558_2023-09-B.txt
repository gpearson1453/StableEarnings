SWEET FACTOR closed to the lead passing the thirteen sixteenths pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was pressured nearing the five sixteenths
pole, drew off at the rail through the far turn and was kept alert to maintain her margin. SUPERSNAKE came away a bit awkwardly and rounded the first turn
in the five path, started an outside bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and cleared second in later yards. LADYNESS
stalked from the four path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, was carried out leaving the turn then
dueled for third. RIDE THE RAPIDS stalked the early pace from the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the
three path, drifted into the lane and relented in the stretch duel for third. ALL THE WAY MAE rounded the opening turn in the three path and showed little
response through the backstretch. MAP THE MOMENT raced off the rail on the first turn and showed little response. WICKED SAUCY raced just off the
early pace inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded past the three eighths.

Footnotes
MUD BUG took quick control of the pace inside, came under pressure past the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady
stretch encouragement and held on. TRANSFER THE FUNDS settled off the pace in the three path, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced two
deep on the far turn, dug in while varying paths in the stretch and dueled for second. MASTER THIS settled off the pace in the five path, left the second turn
outside and gave chase from the three eighths pole, had range on the leaders in the four path on the far turn but was outfinished in the stretch duel for
second. URBAN BANDIT stalked the earlier pace from the three and four paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then
weakened the final sixteenth. RIGHTEOUS MAN saved ground off the pace, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn,
drifted toward the head of the land and showed little further. ADARA raced well off the pace and off the rail early on, gave chase past the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths and showed little in the lane. VOLIERO was not a factor. TIZBIT stalked the earlier pace off the rail, gave
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but weakened past the three eighths. AKINGISALWAYSKING was not a factor. TYLER TIME stumbled at the break
causing his rider to lose his irons but quickly recovered stride and rounded the first turn in the four path, gave way after a half mile and was eased the final
quarter mile. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Mud Bug for alleged interference through the stretch, lodged by the
rider of Transfer The Funds.

LOADED SNIPER exchanged contact with Big Hambone leaving the gate then pressured the pace, raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn but
dug in determinedly through the stretch and took the nod in the final yards. STEVETHEVANDRIVER took over toward the half mile pole and moved to the
inside to set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, dug in gamely leaving the turn but grudgingly ceded the nod in the final
yards. WIDGET FACTORY gave chase, rounded the turn in the three path, drifted leaving the turn then dueled through the stretch for third. BIG HAMBONE
exchanged contact with Loaded Sniper leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn in the five path, then outfinished in the
stretch duel for third. DARK HEDGES chased, raced in the five path on the turn, lugged in through the lane and flattened stride. FLAMING EAST gave
chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail and weakened in the lane. YABBA DABBA DUDE saved ground.

Footnotes
S S SPARTAN ENERGY raced in the five path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole and steadily improved in the three and four paths
on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn, took over and raced clear the final yards. WINDSOR'S TRACKER stalked two deep on the first turn, gave chase
leaving the half mile pole, took the lead nearing the quarter and dug in under steady stretch handling, but was met and relented in later yards. RED
DEVOLUTION was hustled with the early lead inside then rated into the first turn, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, gave up the lead
approaching the quarter, raced close at the rail on the far turn but flattened in the duel through the stretch. JONES FALLS saved early ground, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and finished well. SPECTACULO stalked from the three path the first turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path on the far turn but flattened the final sixteenth. ONLY GET'N BETTER raced well back
inside, angled out leaving the far turn and could only improve his position. LUDO raced in the four path the first turn and showed little response through the
backstretch. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL settled off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened in
the lane. EISELE raced in the three and four paths the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. BRANTLEYS BIG GUN settled off the
rail the first turn, gave chase past the half mile pole and entered the far turn about the six path, angled in through the turn and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
ADVANCE CASH came in early then gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and was
steadily handled to widen later yards. GOLDEN G gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn, dug in to take second later yards and finished well. MR
TINGLES took over while angling inward and rated the early pace, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, was met mid-stretch and flattened
later yards. INSIDE RISK gave chase outside, raced in the five path on the turn and ran evenly down the lane. HEY CONGRATS gave chase, raced in the
five and six paths on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. COWBOY AT HEART was shut off and clipped the heels of STRETCH THE TRUTH early then
picked up the chase, was eased to the four path approaching the head of the lane but showed little further. The latter was forced inward and into Cowboy At
Heart early and had his heels clipped as a result, gave chase from that point but flattened at the rail on the turn. NITRO TIME was unprepared for the break
then saved ground. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Advance Cash for interference soon after the start, lodged by the rider of
Cowboy At Heart, and disqualified the former to sixth place for causing the interference that affected the latter.

NO DENYING DENIS ducked in leaving the gate and made contact with Lucky Bop then settled off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, steadily improved from that point and rounded the far turn about the five path, dug in leaving the turn and took the lead in the final strides.
JUBASLILBALLERINA rounded the first turn about the five path then stalked three wide into the backstretch, challenged approaching the three eighths pole,
dueled for the lead midway on the far turn and dug in determinedly to eke out the advantage over MARINA GRANDE but was caught in the final strides. The
latter was forced in and into Slewing leaving the gate then took the nod two deep at the nine sixteenths pole, was met approaching the three eighths and
dueled at a close disadvantage from that point and dug in gamely to the finish. SILVER RULES rated close inside on the opening turn then picked up the
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path but flattened stride mid-stretch. SLEWING was brushed leaving the gate
then settled off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. LUCKY BOP came away
awkwardly and was bumped then forced inward and into Marina Grande, rounded the first turn about the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and showed little further. JACKYSINTHECASTLE saved ground. LOVE OF GRACE raced with the pace inside
and dueled from the three eighths pole, was met toward the quarter and weakened at the rail on the far turn.
