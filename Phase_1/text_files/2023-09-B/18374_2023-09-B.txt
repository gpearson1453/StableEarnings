the lane and continued unchallenged under a mild drive. PAISLEY'S VISION tracked the clear pacesetter into the turn, cut the corner entering upper stretch,
sustained a steady bid for the clear winner and had to settle for second best. BLOW SUM SMOKE ridden along three wide late on the backstretch, hustled
along turning for home and continued a steady bid for a share. ADMIRAL'S GARNET tugged a bit along the inside in early stages then angled out, hustled
up around the turn but had no response. S C ANGEL chased the leader into the turn then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
LIBERTY'S HAULER tracked the leader in the opening quarter then advanced on the rail to take over a slim lead at the quarter pole, cut the corner and
quickly widened to a clear advantage then held late over fast gaining VALIANT WEST. VALIANT WEST was off slow at the start and trailed up the
backstretch, saved ground and picked up the tempo late on the turn, tipped two wide at the head of the lane, kicked in gamely and was getting to the winner
late. WAR RASCAL tracked the early pacesetter two wide in early stages, moved up closer three wide near the quarter pole, came four wide into upper
stretch and sustained a steady bid to clear the rest. OUTOFQUEMADO was ridden along three wide up the backstretch, chased three to four wide in range
around the turn then came up empty in the lane. TRIPP'S HIT quickly cleared the lead out of the gate, continued to lead the way by a clear advantage in the
opening quarter, got collared for the lead near the quarter pole and tired in the drove.

DREAMIN IT UP was away in good order, shifted in a few paths and prompted the early pace, vied outside of HANKS GIRL around the turn, took a slight
edge at the head of the lane, cleared on top a furlong out and kept to task under confident handling. MORNINGNOONANDNITE tracked the top pair up the
backstretch and around the turn, was ridden along three wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and finished second best. HANKS GIRL set a
pressured pace up the backstretch, vied inside of DREAMIN IT UP around the turn, continued to battle back into stretch run, failed to be a match with
eventual winner past the furlong marker but stayed on and cleared the rest. THAT'S OUR VISION raced just off midpack in early stages, hustled along two
wide around the turn and failed to move on in the lane. ESPRIT ROUGE chased the top trio in the opening quarter, hustled up along the rail around the turn
then weakened in the lane. QUIET I'M NOT raced off the early pace, chased three wide around the turn and never threatened. TENNESSEE GRACE raced
off the pace, swung four wide into stretch run and failed to move into contention. SHE'S SOLID SILVER lacked speed, saved ground around the turn and
had no response.

Footnotes
APRETTYLULABY came away last at the start and steadily advanced along the inside after the start to take closer order, tracked the embattled pair up the
backstretch, tipped out a couple paths and let out a notch to circle up three wide approaching the quarter pole, dueled three deep for the lead into upper
stretch, battled on gamely, dug in and held a slight edge past the furlong marker then drove clear. IVY ABAD GIRL broke on top and briefly led the way then
came under pressure from BYE LOVE GOTTA GO, dueled inside of rival up the backstretch and into the turn, took on the added challenge of
APRETTYLULLABY approaching the quarter pole, battled back along the rail into the final furlong then got denied approaching the final sixteenth. BYE
LOVE GOTTA GO dueled outside of IVY ABAD GIRL up the backstretch and continued to battle around the turn, fought back gamely from between rivals
into the final furlong then yielded late. TAPTHATLUCK tracked the top pair two wide, launched a four wide bid late on the turn and ran on through the lane
for a minor share. SHY RUNNER was never too far back saving ground, chased along the rail around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and failed to
move on. BARBED WIRE raced in the last flight although never far from the frontend, chased three to four wide around the turn then gave way. RUDY
TOOTY raced between rivals in the last flight, hustled along two wide around the turn and had no response.

Footnotes
TIN BADGE sped to the lead at the start and widened to a commanding advantage in hand around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, continued well
clear past the furlong marker, tapped a few times and kept to task. DISCREET INVASION raced off the early pace, saved ground along the rail around the
turn, continued a steady bid just off the inside and produced a solid finish. GIANT GAMBLE chased the top and hustled up along the rail around the turn,
sustained steady bid and cleared a share. SCRUTINIZER raced in range in early stages, chased three wide around the turn then flattened in the lane.
LUCKY LOUIE raced off the pace, came three wide into upper stretch and passed tiring foes in the final furlong. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE raced off the
early speed, swung four wide into upper stretch and lacked a rally. TAKE ME UP BRADY raced off the early pace, coxed two wide late on the turn and failed
to move on. ALL OVER OLIVER was forwardly placed up the backstretch, continued to chase the leader around the turn then tired in the drive.
