Footnotes
LUNA VIEJA broke outwardly, bumped a foe and caused stacking foe outer rivals, was sent to the front approaching the first turn, set the pace along the
inside, drew away from and outer presser with five sixteenths to go, opened up under driving pressure in upper stretch and was ridden out late. ACTIVE
DUTY prompted outside in the opening stages, but was outmoved by rivals on either side entering the first turn, stalked inside of a rival while a bit off of the
rail around that bend, pursued along the rail around the far turn, inherited place from an outer faltering foe at the furlong grounds, shifted ground outwardly
and fended off a bidder for that position late. DR KRINGLE bumped with an outer rival leaving the gates before being squeezed between horses at the start,
moved out of last in the three path around the first turn, lacked response to urging in the four path around the far turn, yet ran on to bid for place in the final
furlong but was kept at bay. GAME WARDEN took contact from an inner rival causing him to put an outer foe to cramped quarters at the start, tracked in the
four to three path, chased two wide around the far turn, entered the lane three wide and between horses and failed to threaten. FIRST PLAYER was
bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, got keen while off of the pace two wide and between horses into the first turn, settled along the inside
approaching the backstretch, but lacked room in upper stretch, remained blocked until the furlong grounds but lacked a bid once clear. DERRICK bumped
an inner rival at the start, pressed two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader with five sixteenths to go and weakened between horses in midstretch.
FEAR OF UNION broke inwardly, laid off of the pace along the inside, backed out of tight quarters at the seven furlong pole, trailed soon after, pursued two
wide around the far turn, entered the lane between horses before encountering traffic in upper stretch, but came up empty.

Footnotes
LUCKY BOSS tracked in the four path, closed in on the leaders at the three furlong pole, bid three wide at the quarter pole, edged an advantage passing
the three sixteenths marker and held sway from his inner counterparts. TRIGGER HAPPY set a clear pace down the backstretch, showed the way in the two
path around the turn, was confronted by a pair of outer challengers nearing the lane, fought on well after being headed in upper stretch and held place.
CARMICHAEL stalked in the three path, moved to press the leader around the turn, bid along with an outer rival entering the lane, led briefly in upper
stretch but was outkicked by his outer counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, kept on between the top pair in the final furlong but yielded late. COX
CANYON brushed with rivals on both sides at the start, laid off of the pace in the tow path and improved position in the closing stages. LONGSHADOW
stalked behind the leader and in the two path, chased bidders entering the lane and gave way. MR. PETERKIN trailed in the three path around the turn and
got outrun.

Footnotes
SHE DAZZLE laid close up along the inside, stalked the top pair from the three path around the turn, took aim in the four path in upper stretch, drove clear
approaching the furlong grounds and held sway. DUPLICITOUS tracked along the inside, awaited racing room behind traffic in upper stretch, split foes to
gain place at the furlong grounds, attempted a bid inside of the leader soon after, but was turned away in the closing stages and desperately saved place.
PRIDDIS broke slowly, lacked speed in the two to three path, shifted out to the five path while picking up stride in upper stretch, then rallied outside of foes
and narrowly missed reaching place. EVERYOTHERWON chased two wide, encountered mild traffic while among foes in upper stretch and was one paced
through the final furlong. L. A. STAR trailed in the two path, shifted out to the nine path in upper stretch and improved position. DONYA KNOW IT set the
pace inside of a prompting rival, got headed by that one passing the three furlong pole, then gave way in upper stretch. TAP N SWAY prompted the pace
two wide, wrestled an advantage passing the three furlong pole, but was headed by an outer bidder at the three sixteenths marker and weakened between
horses in midstretch. JOAN'S WAY failed to factor from the two path. HOLDONTOYOURTIARA lacked speed in the four path and faded.

Footnotes
GET TWISTED broke half a beat slow, then got keen among foes entering the turn two wide and between horses, tipped to the four path in upper stretch,
launched a rally in midstretch and reeled in the leaders approaching the wire. RED RIVER MAGIC stalked along the inside under firm grasps just behind the
leaders early on, chased in the two path in upper stretch, gradually closed in leaving the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer oncharging foe
inside the final sixteenth before splitting foes late to reach place. GOING THE DISTANCE set the pace along the inside, inched clear of outer rivals in upper
stretch, held sway through midstretch but was caught by an outer rival in the final sixteenth and lost place late. COWICHAN (IRE) bumped with an inner rival
early on, tracked three wide, ranged up turning for home to take aim in upper stretch, but lacked a bid while hanging on her left lead and was outkicked in
the final sixteenth. THREE POLKS bumped with an outer rival early on, pursued from midpack along the inside, then chased along the fence in the final
furlong. DREAM ON STORMY took contact from an inner rival at the start before being bumped by rivals on both sides in the opening furlong, tracked two
wide and between horses, chased in the three path in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival while flopping back to her left lead approaching the
sixteenth pole. BE MISS HATTIE broke a beat slowly, lacked speed three wide, fanned to the seven path in upper stretch, stayed on outside of rivals, then
leaned inwardly and put an inner foe to tight quarters at the sixteenth pole. SCATLIE bumped an outer rival leaving the gates, got jostled between horses
and pinched back among foes early on, then steadied behind rivals at the half mile pole, raced off of of the pace in the two path around the turn, then lacked
a bid between runners while hanging on her left lead. MON DIEU broke a step slow, trailed along the inside, moved up inside of rivals in the final furlong,
then lost her rider in the gallop out, but was gathered by an out-rider and walked off. ENDORA benignly reared in the starting gate, prompted the pace two
wide, bid turning for home, then yielded between horses in upper stretch and weakened. SASSY WALKER pursued from midpack three wide, fanned to the
five path entering the lane and tired. GOLDEN STAR broke outwardly, laid off of the pace in the thee path, entered the lane in the six path, but lacked a rally
before steadying out of tight quarters created by an outer rival at the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
NORTHERN FLAME set the pace in the two path, showed the way from an outer presser around the far turn, shook free of that one as REAL MEN VIOLIN
took aim entering the lane and held sway thereafter. REAL MEN VIOLIN stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair at the three furlong pole,
took aim as the eventual winner shook free entering the lane and chased that one home. CHAPERONE laid off of the pace two wide, was urged along in the
three to two path around the far turn, yet ran on to gain show from an outer rival approaching the final sixteenth. OMEX stalked in the four to three path
around the first turn, pressed two wide down the backstretch, but weakened between horses entering the lane. B WAYNE broke a step slow, trailed along
the inside, advanced in the five path around the far turn, but flattened out without reaching contention. PHREDDIE MAC raced forwardly three wide and
between horses into the first turn, but steadied when put to tight quarters approaching the seven furlong pole, tracked in the three path soon after, but
yielded in the four path and between horses around the far turn. FARM TEAM tracked in the two path but faded approaching the far turn. LUCERITO
BLANCO lacked speed in the two path, then was outrun around the far turn and eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
COEXIST tracked along the inside, shifted out turning for home, tipped four wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes to bid at the furlong grounds and
drove clear. HOME PORT tracked in the three path, took aim on the leader along with an outer foe in upper stretch, got outkicked by that one passing the
three sixteenths pole, yet kept on to bid for place entering the final sixteenth and edged that position late. CONDIMENT GIRL dueled for the lead two wide,
led turning for home, drove clear briefly in upper stretch, but was headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and lost place in the late stages.
MOTOWN MIKA chased in the two path, then lacked a bid while one-paced in the lane. ARGUMENTAL popped open the starting gate pre-race without
leaving it, then was backed out and cleared to go following a veterinarian exam, laid off of the pace in the two path, retreated to trail entering the turn and
made little impact. WHAT'S TO DO lacked speed in the four path around the turn and never got involved. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER dueled for the lead
along the inside but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
PARCHMENT PARTY was slow into stride between horses early on, trailed along the inside, rallied along the rail in upper stretch, slipped through a narrow
rail seam inside of rivals to bid at the furlong grounds and inched clear. DJANGO broke a step slow, lacked speed in the two to three path, fanned to the
seven path entering the lane, rallied outside of foes to bid at the furlong grounds as a rail-skimming rival did the same, but was staved off by that one in the
closing stages. WARP NINE saved ground off of the pace, quickly gained while hugging the rail turning for home, but was blocked and stymied behind the
leaders in upper stretch, found a seam three wide and between rivals at the furlong grounds after foes on either side got a jump, then chased the top pair
home. ALLIED VICTORY pursued from midpack four to three wide around the first turn, crept closer while tracking around the far turn, floated to the five
path entering the lane and stayed on mildly. COLLINS stalked in the three to two path while tucking behind the top pair around the first turn, loomed a
danger from the pocket while in hand turning for home, took aim in the three to four path in upper stretch while between rivals, but lacked a kick and yielded.
BLACK DIAMOND vied two wide while a path away from his inner counterpart, sparred with that one while taking the far turn in the two path, led narrowly
nearing the lane, but failed to kick away, shifted ground outwardly before getting outkicked by rivals on both sides at the furlong grounds and weakened
between horses. BAYOU MAGIC tracked along the inside, pursued from the two path around the far turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, but
lacked a rally between horses. LE GRIS set the pace inside of a vying rival, required coaxing to sustain the duel around the far turn, got headed nearing the
lane, fought on through upper stretch, but faltered between horses at the furlong grounds. SHARPENYOURFAITH laid off of the pace in the three to two
path around the first turn and faded.

Footnotes
BALTA pursued from midpack in the two path, rallied along the rail to bid inside of the leader at the furlong grounds and drove clear. EPIC BATTLE bumped
with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, then stayed on outside of foes in the final
furlong to bid for place in the final sixteenth, then edged that position approaching the wire. CALL ME ANDY stalked the embattled leading pair from the
three to two path around the turn, tipped to the four path entering the lane, got outkicked by an inner rallying rival in upper stretch, yet kept on to produce a
bid for place along with an outer rival passing the sixteenth pole, but got outfinished. NORMANDY HERO set the pace inside of a vying rival, drew away
from that foe while entering the lane in the two path, but was bested by an inner bidder at the furlong grounds, yielded and was surpassed by an outer pair
in the final sixteenth. COULDITBEMAJIC broke slowly, laid off of the pace along the inside, pursued from the two path around the turn and failed to menace.
AMERICAN RASCAL prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart while being floated to the three path entering the lane
and folded between horses. MI OSCURO SECRETO bumped with an inner rival at the start, then lagged behind throughout and was outrun.

furlong grounds and held from an outer on-charging bidder late. STIR CRAZY saved ground off of the pace, shifted out turning for home, fanned to the six
path in upper stretch, rallied outside of foes in the final furlong, claimed place in the final sixteenth before continuing to close in on the clear leader late, but
ran out of ground. JOYFUL APPLAUSE set the pace along the inside, clung to a narrow advantage in the two path in upper stretch, but was headed by an
outer bidder approaching midstretch, lost place in the final sixteenth and narrowly saved show from an outer foe at the wire. LADY HIDEAWAY stalked
along the inside, awaited racing room just off of the fence while behind rivals entering the lane, tipped inwardly in upper stretch, but lacked room for a rail
rally, altered course two wide at the furlong grounds, lost show to an outer rallying rival at the sixteenth pole, then kept on to rebid for that position late but
missed. LILLY LANE broke outwardly, rated at the rear along the inside, took the far turn in the three path, fanned to the five path entering the lane before
shifting out to the seven path in upper stretch and stayed on in the final furlong. HONEY HAULER pressed two wide, vied in the three path entering the lane,
but yielded between horses at the three sixteenths poe. SHE'S GONE pursued from midpack along the inside, tipped to the four path entering the lane, but
lacked a bid. FRIENDLYPERSUASION raced in midpack two wide, fanned to the five path entering the lane and gave way. ONE TIME MO laid off of the
pace two wide and failed to factor. ROC'S PRINCESS broke slow then got rank as an inner rival shifted across her path at the start, raced at the rear two
wide and was through entering the far turn.

Footnotes
FILLY CRYSTAL vied along the inside, got headed while inside of a trio of foes entering the lane, fought on, regained an advantage late and lasted. BIRDIE
ROSE prompted between the pace setters early on, backed off to stalk from the two path entering the turn, swung five wide in upper stretch, rallied in the
final furlong to offer a bid nearing the wire, but missed. ITSABLINGTHING tracked four wide, bid turning for home, led entering the lane, but gave way to
rivals on both sides in the final sixteenth. STAGFLATION bumped with an inner rival at the start, chased three wide and between horses while under steady
coaxing, bid along with an outer rival turning for home, but yielded between horses in upper stretch and weakened after flopping back to his left lead. MY
BEST DAY EVER vied three to two wide into the turn, then between horses nearing the lane, but yielded in tight quarters in upper stretch. IMPERATOR
FURIOSA laid off of the pace two wide and failed to factor. CHANEL POINT bumped with an outer rival at the start, chased along the inside and weakened
turning for home.
