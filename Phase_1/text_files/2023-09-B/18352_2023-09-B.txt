GENTLEMEN'S CLUB brushed the gate to lose a step at the start, dropped back and trailed well off the rail, went four wide into the turn, moved into the
three path around the bend, went four wide into the lane, rallied while drifting in a bit and flew late to inhale the top trio from outside. MR BIG BUCKS broke
in and bumped, vied between rivals for command, led two wide into the lane, lost command in upper stretch, fought back from inside and was edged by the
late rush from the winner. BEER MONEY vied three deep up the backstretch, around the turn and into the lane, took over in upper stretch, dueled into the
final furlong, carried a short lead into the final sixteenth and was edged by the top pair. HALO UNCLE fought for the lead inside a pair of rivals, chased the
leaders past the quarter pole, altered out at the eighth pole, re-bid in deep stretch and finished gamely to the wire. BALLYMUN got bumped leaving the gate,
showed speed between rivals then got crowded early to lose some ground, chased two wide into the turn, angled over to the rail around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
EGOMANIA chased three wide around the first turn, moved up from outside in the middle stages, bid three deep on the far turn, had the rider lose his whip
in upper stretch when asked left handed, battled TIZ TOK through the final furlong and dug in to edge the runner-up. TIZ TOK reluctant to load, broke out a
bit, set the pace outside a rival early, cleared inner rival on the backstretch but gained company from outside, vied inside a pair of rivals through the far turn,
fought head to head with EGOMANIA in the furlong grounds and yielded grudgingly. SIR FLATTER chased two wide around the clubhouse turn, moved up
to apply pressure from between rivals, vied through the far turn, failed to kick on with the top pair in upper stretch and steered inward and weakened in the
lane. FROST ALERT pressed from inside early on, failed to keep up on the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

THE MOON showed speed three deep between then ceded command, chased three wide into the turn, moved out and came five wide into the lane, came
out further in upper stretch and flattened. MENTIROSA took a bump from outer rival in the beginning, chased out of range in the three path, moved out near
the three-sixteenths pole and lacked a rally. MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING vied for the lead inside rivals, could not keep up past the three-eighths pole and
weakened in the drive. REIGN OVER ME broke a step slow and dropped back early, trailed a bit off the rail to the stretch and was not a factor. RAY OF
THE SEA broke a step slow, stalked from inside, dropped back on the turn, angled out into the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
KINGS RIVER KNIGHT broke in a bit, stalked three wide outside a rival early, closed in on the leader leaving the backstretch, took over early on the far turn,
drifted four around the bend, maintained a short lead over FAST DRAW MUNNINGS down the lane and edged away in the final sixteenth. FAST DRAW
MUNNINGS stalked two wide around the clubhouse turn, bid three deep at the seven-sixteenths pole, fought outside KINGS RIVER KNIGHT while getting
floated out to the five path on the far turn, kept the pressure on into the final furlong but faltered in deep stretch. SHORTMAN was off slow on the inside then
coaxed along early trailing the field, traveled along the inside then two wide on the clubhouse turn, came out entering the backstretch, went three wide into
the far turn, angled six wide into the lane and was along for the show honors. JOHNNY PODRES settled near the inside early, tipped out leaving the far
turn, angled back inside in the stretch and churned on next to the fence to earn a minor award. FINNEUS chased four wide around the first turn, entered the
far turn two wide, steered out leaving that bend and weakened. HAIL FREEDOM sprinted clear from outside and crossed over to the rail, opened up a
comfortable lead early on the backstretch, held a diminishing approaching the far turn, was overtaken past the seven-sixteenths pole, started to weaken
around the bend, tired in the lane and eased in the final furlong, then walked off following the race.
