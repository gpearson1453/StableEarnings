MISS Z had speed off rail under pressure, shook inside pace rivals before turn, took pressured lead inside turn, remained under pressure through stretch
while drifting out into THATSALOTOFBLING, held on. THATSALOTOFBLING advanced outside, forced issue turn, gave best outside stretch while being
bothered by winner drifting out, was still coming at the wire. ASTARTOBE stalked outside, back of forced pace turn, finished evenly. OUR PETUNIA forced
pace between horses early, inside turn, lacked rally. MISS M J stalked wide, lacked rally. ALWAYS THE LIL ONE forced pace inside early, dropped back
before turn, faded. The rider aboard THATSALOTOFBLING lodged a claim of foul against the rider of the winner for interference through the stretch. There
was no change.
