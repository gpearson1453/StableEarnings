HAPPY IN HEELS dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and drew off in the lane. YVONNE'S MISS
veered out and bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, trailed the field early, came around the turn in the three and four path, began a bid
passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. DODGEBALL stalked the pace setters on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued
around the turn in the four path and chased on in the lane. TRIBAL QUEEN tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the
bend and was outkicked in the stretch. SHACKED STATESIDE was bumped by the horse to his inside at the break, recovered to duel on the outside
through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the three path and faded in the lane. BIDOFHONEY veered out and bumped with the horse to her
outside leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack on the inside through the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and never threatened.
RUNNIN BOOTS raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and was empty from there. ELIZA ROSE
bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the
bend and tired in the stretch.

through a narrow hole and got up late. COMMANDER REX saved ground around the first turn, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, continued
around the far turn in the two path, and dug in gamely in the lane while drifting mildly but was nabbed at the wire. RYAN EXPRESS saved ground around
the first bend, raced off the pace up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole, gained ground
on the rail in upper stretch, raced in tight quarters and was brushed by TOP COP near the wire and narrowly missed. GHOST CREEK raced in the four path
early, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and kept on in the stretch while drifting some in the final
furlong. KENTUCKY ICE raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the
four path and kept on in the stretch. DABOOGEYMAN raced in the middle of the pack in the two path through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn
from the four path and was outkicked in the lane. OKLAHOMA MOON raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch,
continued around the far turn still in the two path and was no factor. MAJESTIC FLASH raced in the two path early, settled in the middle of the pack for the
