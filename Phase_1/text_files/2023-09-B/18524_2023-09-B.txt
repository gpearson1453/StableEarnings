ACCEPT THE OUTCOME (IRE) set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear and held under steady pressure. BROOKLYN
GIRLEE stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then was no match for that one, while clearly best of the rest.
NO TAPPIN OUT tracked the pace, angled out to bid three wide into the stretch, then flattened the final furlong and held the show. OUTTA THE CLOUD ran
evenly for a half, came three wide into the stretch and had no rally. INVENTING ANNA ran evenly, inside.

Footnotes
RIVZONAROLL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task.
DONTINVADEMYSPACE rated inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and
closed well for the place. SILVER TOKEN mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and had a mild late gain. PUNX
unhurried, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for a share. I
ONCE STOOD ALONE stalked the pace on the outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch
and weakened. SCIENCE TO WIN ran evenly, inside. GOLDEN OAK was never involved.

TWO HEARTED set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the turn, then drew off and was kept to the task. NOW I'M HERE tracked the pace, saved
ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch, then was no threat to the winner, while clearly best of the rest. BERYL RACER well placed and outside,
looped to position four wide through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch, evened and held the show. Z INDY LINDY stalked the pace from between
rivals, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, flattened and held a share. WARRIOR BERNICE unhurried, lost
some ground four wide through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and improved position. ANOTHERDAYOFWORK showed little, inside. TURBO
MAGGIE well placed and three wide, faded through the turn. QUEEN CATALINA was never involved.

COUNTY COURT allowed to settle, moved up and angled to the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled in for
clear racing room, made a steady gain and drew off late. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turns, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch, closed willingly and was forced to steadied hard at the furlong marker, then closed for the place. TAMANRASSETT mid pack,
saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and edged up for the show. HARD COUNT set the pace on the
inside, stayed on when challenged at the furlong marker, then faded late. FUEL THE BERN stalked the early pace on the outside, moved up to vied for the
lead, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside, then faded the final furlong. CHIC N WILBUR fractious in the gate, was never

Footnotes
FOLK HERO well placed and off the rail, moved up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, drew off late
and was kept to the task. RICHIES NOBLE GIRL mid pack, moved up on the two path through the second turn, angled in and came through inside of rivals
into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the place. BEAUTIFUL STAR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, shook clear from a rival
through the second turn, stayed on when challenged at the furlong marker, then weakened late and held the show. NEVISIAN SPIRIT tracked the pace well
back, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. SCOOP THERE
IT IS well placed and outside, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. TWISTED
TREASURE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled three wide into the stretch and improved position. THISAINTJUMPSTREET was no
factor. SUMTING RIGHT stalked the pace on the outside, vied down the backstretch, lost some ground through the second turn, then faded into the stretch.
