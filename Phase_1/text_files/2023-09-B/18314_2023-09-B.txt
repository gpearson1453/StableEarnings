DRIVEN BY SPEED was reserved early on the inside, advanced up the inside on the far turn, angled out leaving the three sixteenths to the far outside and
closed well to edge away late to prove best under a drive. FILLMORE EAST was three wide into the first turn, then settled two wide, and was between rivals
by the half mile marker, then advanced three wide on the turn, then was fanned out five wide leaving the turn while making a bid, then continued well but
was outfinished by the winner while getting the nod for the place award. COMPLETE was rated along the inside, advanced on the turn on the inside, then
swung out four wide and forcing FILLMORE EAST out leaving the turn, made a bid but was out-kicked while losing the bob for the place award. SERENE
WARRIOR tracked the pace two wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to duel for command, then weakened the final furlong. FROSTED WILD RIDE was
keen early to set the early pace while clear, then was headed on the turn and dueled for the lead to the three sixteenths and then weakened the final
furlong. BLIND SIGHT was three wide into the first turn, then settled three wide on the backstretch and tired. YOURINDENIAL failed to menace.

Footnotes
WILD CREATION was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, then turned back a bid from UNIVERSAL DESIGN on the turn to shake clear off the turn,
then held sway late to score the victory, driving. LADY AHAVA was bumped at the start, well placed on the inside, angled out four wide by the quarter pole,
then rallied well to be slowly gaining late. UNIVERSAL DESIGN stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but hung in the lane. ELUSIVE
EMPRESS broke in at the start bumping a rival, then settled back on the inside and had a belated rally to gain the last spot in the superfecta on the inside.
CONTEMPTUOUS MISS chased the pace four wide, came five wide into the lane and drifted in by the furlong marker and weakened. ZIFFY BUG was
slammed at the start, reserved early, came six wide into the lane and had no rally. GOLDEN EXPRESS was bumped at the start, chased the pace two to
three wide on the turn, then was four wide and steadied slightly by the quarter pole and then was empty.

MIDNIGHT ACT stalked the pace in between rivals, made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command, then edged clear in the furlong grounds to
prove best under a drive. GRAND WISER pressed the early pace on the inside, then rated back on the inside, angled out four wide leaving the quarter pole,
came four wide and made a bid off the turn but hung late. HERE'S WALDO set a pressured pace two wide, then dueled for the lead on the inside by the
quarter pole, then faded late. CRITICAL THINKING tracked the pace two to three wide and weakened, bested rest. P JS SILVER DUKE was off a step slow
and failed to menace. COOL COMEDIAN stalked the pace four wide and stopped.

WILL OR WON'T tracked the pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to take over by the quarter pole, then drew out to prove much the best
while being ridden out. AFRICAN ANGEL was rated on the inside early, made a four wide move on the turn but proved to be no match for the winner,
second best. DESI'S REWARD was keen early to set a fast pace while clear racing off the rail, then was headed on the turn and weakened, bested rest.
SUPER DUPER FLY chased the early pace on the inside, eased off the inside on the turn and weakened. THE HAUNTED ROOM was reserved early while
four wide, five wide on the turn and had no rally. KEYSTONE WARRIOR chased the pace three wide and tired. POP THE CLUTCH was fractious in the
gate, off slowly and failed to respond.
