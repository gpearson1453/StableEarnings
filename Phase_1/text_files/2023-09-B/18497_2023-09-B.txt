LIFE OF SATURDAYS rated on the front end from just off the rail, was let out on the bend, drew off under a drive in the lane, dug in deep stretch and held
on. LINDALOUIMAGE rated running widest on the backstretch, commenced her bid four wide on the turn, floated out some into the stretch, was all out,
gradually lugged in under right-handed urging through the waning yards and was too late. ARCH FLYER in contention three wide from the beginning, took
over second upper stretch then leveled off inside the final furlong. J LOVE crowded briefly at the start, was prominent behind LIFE OF SATURDAYS on the
backstretch but faded on the bend. AUNT STELLA broke outward, brushing J LOVE from the rear, was hustled up inside to dispute the pace but began to
yield before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
BORDER STAR bumped twice with CLASSY ACTION shortly after the break, was settled inside, came into contention just off the rail on the bend, rallied to
take the lead inside the last eighth then gradually drew off. LIMANI in the second flight on the backstretch, squeezed through along the rail to vie for the lead
with two furlongs to go, moved clear and came into the lane just off the inside, steadily drifted out but proved easily second best. WILDWOOD ENOUGH in
contention early toward the outside, lost ground widest through the turn, battled for third in the stretch and edged ahead for the show late. CLASSY ACTION
lugged in some after the start, bumped twice with BORDER STAR, was settled at the back, had the rail on the bend, angled to the outside upper stretch and
was closing in for third in the late going. MADELYN ATTACK prominent between rivals, went for the lead three wide on the turn, fanned out further entering
the lane and flattened out. SHORT STRAW broke in stride and sprinted away, was challenged from both sides on the bend and gave way the last quarter
mile. AWESOME N SWEET stayed well off the inside most of the way and failed to menace.

Footnotes
WINDIGO SPIRIT rated off the early pace, went for the lead from outside on the bend, edged ahead from path four upper stretch, moved clear inside the
last eighth, began to wear down in the late going but kept SENOR MIKE at bay. SENOR MIKE lugged in slightly after the start, jostled with EAST OF INDIA
leaving the chute, moved to the inside with four furlongs to go, swung out to path five for the stretch run, altered in when his path was taken upper stretch,
altered in again for racing room with a sixteenth left and came up short for the win. TENOR without early speed, was three wide on the bend, lost ground
fanning out to path six for the drive and passed tired ones to gain third late. FUTURE VISION hustled early, saved ground taking the turn and ran evenly
through the lane. EAST OF INDIA jostled leaving the chute, pressed the pacesetter, took a slight lead three wide on the bend then slowly wore down for the
stretch run. KANITHAPPEN was sent to get the early lead, set a pressured pace off the rail but inside rivals, was overtaken from both sides on the turn,
angled out some upper stretch, drifted out further and continued to fade.

BEEALEA was away slowly, progressed just off the rail on the backstretch, vied for the lead three wide between rivals on the second bend, battled inside
MILLARD'S SMILE the last two furlongs and held sway. MILLARD'S SMILE settled from outside, picked up his pace after a half mile to contest the pace
widest on the second turn, fought gamely the last quarter mile, lacked the needed late kick but was easily second best. MAC PANDOWDY chased the early
speed from inside, went for the lead along the rail on the second bend but could not sustain his bid in the stretch. LONESOME DREAM was hustled up to
circle rivals on the first turn, was clear of the rest entering the backstretch, began to wear down with three furlongs to go, was overtaken from both sides
nearing the end of six furlongs, angled out upper stretch and steadily gave way. A BOLD RYDE quit while toward the outside after a half mile, was eased in
the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
BUMPER GIRL rated between foes, commenced her bid from outside on the bend, lost further ground fanning seven wide into the lane, continued her rally
and swept past CAT TALE BREEZE the last thirty yards. CAT TALE BREEZE broke alertly, steadily angled in on the backstretch, saved ground taking the
turn, shook off BULU upper stretch but began to wear down in the late going and narrowly held onto second. JEMEZ FALLS bumped at the start, was
without early speed, picked up her pace, along the rail on the bend, lost some time angling out six wide for a clear path upper stretch, surged between rivals
inside the last furlong, lugged in some nearing the sixteenth marker, held a straight path in the late going and drew clear for third the last seventy yards.
BULU vied for the lead outside CAT TALE BREEZE from the beginning, floated out some entering the lane, drifted out slightly once straightened for the
drive, did not stay with CAT TALE BREEZE and gradually wore down deep stretch. DART ATTACK prominent just behind the early speed, found herself
boxed in on the turn, gained a clear path just off the rail into the stretch and began to wear down. BLUE EVEN SCORE forwardly placed toward the outside,
made her bid three wide on the bend, swung out to path five entering the lane, flattened out and was steadied when crowded near the sixteenth marker.
ROARINGLIKETHUNDER crowded leaving the chute, raced in contention between horses but began to flatten as she fanned three wide into the stretch.
WRAPPINJUSTICE chased from outside, was in path five entering the stretch and had no significant response. HEY MA lugged in some leaving the chute
to bump with ROARINGLIKETHUNDER, was void of speed, never far off the inside and failed to menace. DESTINY'S DREAM well placed inside on the
backstretch, began to fade after three furlongs.

Footnotes
TROUBLE FINDS ME shared the early lead from outside, moved clear into the bend, gradually drifted out as she lengthened her lead through the lane and
maintained full control under steady handling. ZENCHUA SKY reluctant to load, was without early speed outside rivals once the race began, picked up her
pace five wide on the turn, rallied belatedly outside horses the last eighth and caught ABBMAR for second. ABBMAR was bumped and forced into MINI
DREWW at the start, quickly recovered to vie for the lead just off the inside, did not stay with TROUBLE FINDS ME while along the rail on the bend, swung
outside the latter leaving the turn and slowly wore down deep stretch. TEMPLUNA broke outward, starting a chain reaction of bumping, chased from
between rivals, advanced four wide on the turn, gained third as she angled in some upper stretch and leveled off inside the final furlong. WITCHING was a
factor from inside on the backstretch but faded on the bend. MINI DRESS bumped and forced out at the break, trailed, moved to the inside into the turn,
passed a couple tired rivals upper stretch then leveled off. PRINCESS MANDII raced in contention between horses on the backstretch but gave way two
wide with three furlongs to go. AIKEN TO BE TAKIN broke alertly, was soon in the second flight from outside and began to fade from path three on the turn.

Footnotes
JULYNNE shared the early lead from outside, was three wide through the bend, angled in beside LOVEYOULIKECRAZY midstretch and edged ahead of
that one the final sixteenth. LOVEYOULIKECRAZY was sent to contest the pace inside rivals, battled along the rail in the lane and slowly wore down the last
sixteenth. LUTION soon trailed, progressed along the rail on the bend, fanned out to path three for the drive, rallied belatedly between horses, gained third
inside the final sixteenth and proved clearly best of the rest. TENSE unruly in the gate, was urged to dispute the pace between rivals, two wide through the
turn then began to wear down for the drive. PRIMITY hesitated at the break, advanced between horses, was four wide taking the bend and gave way the
last two furlongs. FREEDOM ATTACK was a contender just off the inside on the backstretch, began to fade along the rail on the turn, angled out nearing the
end of a half mile and continued to yield. DRAGONFLY KISSES stayed well off the inside and showed little.

Footnotes
COPPER CROSSING broke alertly, was rated not far off the pace between rivals, roused on the second bend, moved to the rail nearing the quarter pole,
took the advantage with a sixteenth to go and held on. WILLOW RIDGE raced in contention from inside, angled out between horses on the second turn,
rallied upper stretch, was steadied off heels with a furlong to go, altered out, brushed with READY REDDING, continued his bid four wide but was too late.
BAM BAM CAM vied for the lead between foes from the beginning, gained a slight advantage three wide on the second bend, battled through the lane and
slowly wore down the final sixteenth. GEORGE'S VISION settled inside after the break, swung back out entering the backstretch, lost ground widest through
the second turn, made a strong move outside horses in the stretch but was also too late. READY REDDING still had his assistant starter in front of him
when the gate opened, swiped the gate breaking outward as he pushed past the starter, forcing the assistant starter out of the front of the gate, bumped
with OPTION soon after, quickly recovered to be forwardly placed five wide on the first bend, pressed the pacesetters from outside on the backstretch,
moved clear for third four wide on the second turn, fanned out some for the drive, lugged in nearing the eighth pole was crowded by WILLOW RIDGE soon
after, altered out slightly and finished evenly. KRAMDEN was also settled inside, angled out some on the second turn, came into the lane three wide and
passed between tired horses. SPEEDY G shared the lead between rivals from the early going, dueled two wide in the stretch but flattened out inside the
final eighth. OPTION bumped just after the start, was a factor just off the inside but faded four wide on the second bend. FLASHY RICHIE raced in
contention from inside but also gave way on the second turn. RULE FOLLOWER quickly recovered from a hesitant start to vie for the lead inside rivals into
the first bend but gave way into the second turn. There was a stewards' inquiry into READY REDDING'S start but no action was taken after their review.
