SUNROOF prompted the pace in the four path, took over the lead and tipped into the two path entering the far turn, opened up from back in the four path
turning into the stretch, and was driven out. GREY PRINCESS shifted to the rail going into the first turn, tracked in the five path down the backside, was
under coaxing in the three path rounding the far turn, floated out to the six path into the stretch , and chased on for place. ACQUIRED TASTE set the pace
in the two path, dropped back a couple spots early into the far turn, tipped out to the three path entering the stretch, and dug in to hold show. UNIFIEDS

DUDEFOOLINGDARLING stalked in the two path, but backed up early around the far turn. STARSHIP SIGRUN had to check along the rail going into the
first turn, trailed in the three path down the backside, was coaxed between foes going into the far turn, but did not threaten around the three path down the
lane.

Footnotes
BURNING MAN settled off the pace while racing three wide, swung five wide near the quarter pole, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and
forged ahead. WICKED GENIUS raced off the pace two wide around the first turn, angled out early on the backstretch, launched a four wide bid around the
far turn, took over near the quarter pole, led to the sixteenth pole and held well for the place. PLUMA ROJA tracked the pace three wide, tipped out in upper
stretch and was one-paced through the lane. NO ANGEL led in the two path through the opening quarter, stalked inside down the backstretch and around
the far turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch, bid between foes in midstretch and flattened out late. UNIFIED CONQUEST raced off the pace four wide,
angled six wide turning for home and had a mild rally widest. EUPHORIA STAR was outrun while saving ground early and going five wide around the far
turn. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) advanced four wide to the lead around the first turn, cleared late on that bend, set the pace inside from there to quarter pole and
retreated through the final furlong. SUN VIKING prompted the pace two wide and faltered in the lane.

Footnotes
FOREVER UNCAPTURED stalked in the four path, ranged up to bid in the three path rounding the turn, ran on while drifting out slightly down the lane, took
the lead passing the eighth pole, and was driven clear. SHARP PIPPA was held up along the rail early, roused from the two path into the turn, swung out to
the three path into the stretch, and kept on to get up for place. J J MONET set the pace in the three path, was nudged along in the two path early around the
turn, floated out to the four path into the lane, stayed on her left lead, and faded in the final furlong to show. HOW BOUT DAT was fractious in the gate,
trailed in the two path, angled out to the four path turning into the stretch, and finished evenly. GHOST FORCE had a slow start, chased in the five path, was
driven from the six path into the stretch, but did not threaten. SHOW ME LOVE rated in the six path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, but
made no impact. MRS. CASH MAN tracked inside, was coaxed to bid from the rail rounding the turn, but gaveway in the two path entering the lane.

SONICUS broke a bit awkwardly, trailed early, raced in the three path around most of the turn, angled five wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and
was up late. TREVESS stalked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide in upper stretch and rallied between foes. GRAYTANA set the pace along the rail and
led until deep stretch. LOOKING FOR HOPE pressed the pace two wide and weakened in the lane. CAJUN FANTASY chased the pace two wide and
lacked a closing bid. SPEIGHTFUL SIS prompted the pace three wide and faded through the lane. L. E. GRAY was outrun while racing four wide.

Footnotes
MISS SAYELY set an open pace along the rail, was cued passing the quarter, extended her advantage along the rail under a ride down the lane, and was
wrapped up in the closing stages. LLAMARADA trailed along the inside, split foes under a drive passing the quarter, swung out to the five path into the
stretch, lugged in, and was up for place. PARALLEL stalked in the three path, was driven into the turn, but flattened from the three path in the stretch for
show. BIGBOUQUETOFROSES chased in the three path, was under a heavy drive in the four path around the turn, floated out to the seven path into the
stretch, and did not threaten. DANCING N DIXIE tracked in the two path, received right handed cues early around the turn, but was empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
LOST CITY set the pace in the three path, opened up slightly in the two path rounding the turn, was cued while tipping to the rail at the top of the lane, and
held sway under a drive. SERGEANT SINATRA pressed in the four path, was cued from the three path early around the turn, and dug in from the three path
down the lane to hold place. STRAIGHT TIME stalked in the three path, angled to the rail going into the turn, tipped back out to the two path into the stretch,
and kept on for show. LAS OLAS chased in the four path, shifted to the two path while under a ride into the turn, went back out to the four path entering the
stretch, and finished evenly. SIR AUSTIN tracked in the six path but flattened from the five path in the stretch. MIRO trailed inside, shifted out under coaxing
around the turn, but made no impact from the six path in the stretch. BLUE SOLDIER was hustled off the pace in the two path but never menaced.
VINDICATED TIGER prompted the pace in the five path but backed up turning into the stretch.
