Footnotes
SHEZA NUT took control shortly away from the gates, set a well measured, well rated pace on a clear lead, widened her advantage turning for home and
kept on unchallenged to the wire. BICARB BETTY tracked the pace to the far turn, rallied up two wide to be prominent at the head of the lane and finished
well while no match for the winner. MEAN ELENITA stalked the pace while well positioned along the rail, rallied turning for home while cutting the corner
and lacked a late response. EMPIRE SUNRISE chased the early pace through the first turn, dropped back down the backside to trail and passed weaker
down the lane. TRIP CHARGE raced four wide down the backside while moving up to be prominently placed and faded in the far turn. QUITE WHIMSICAL
rushed up between horses down the backstretch to make an early bid and gave way turning for home.

Footnotes
CIRCLE BACK JACK tracked the leaders from two wide to midway on the turn, circled four wide to engage the leaders in upper stretch and prevailed in a
determined drive. MANUELITO raced along the fence from off the pace down the backstretch, crept up the rail through the turn while steadily making up
ground, cut the corner turning for home and finished well along the fence to gain the place. WHOSFORJUSTICE pressed the early pace from the rail,
moved up to duel on the lead through the turn and upper stretch and kept on through the lane only to be out-finished late. FIRST CROWNED broke alertly to
take the lead from the gate, dueled from two wide to deep stretch and weakened inside the final hundred yards in a game effort. CIBOLO raced close up for
the first quarter, lost position in the turn and came again belatedly to be gaining at the wire. HARD LUCK JUSTICE was never a factor.

BACKYARD JUSTICE took control of the pace shortly from the gate, set a well rated pace to the far turn while on a clear lead, maintained his advantage to
deep stretch and held well having never been threatened. LOOKING GOOD LEWIS tracked the pace to the far turn, angled out four wide turning for home
and closed well to take the place. SCENIC JUSTICE unhurried for the first half mile to be near the back, commenced a rally midway on the turn, angled
wide for the drive and closed belatedly to be gaining late. KILLER HOTROD prompted the pace down the backside to be well positioned, made a bid in the
turn when called upon and finished evenly. MUSTY RED moved up the rail down the backside in an early bid to threaten on the turn and flattened out in the
lane. MYSTERY IMPACT never menaced at any time. WISHY WASHY trailed most of the way as no threat. BIG BOY VICK stalked the pace from three
wide to the far turn and came up empty.

EKATI FLATTER pressed the early pace, assumed command entering the turn, repelled the challenge of the runner-up in upper stretch and held on late
determinedly. CHANDANA stalked the pace from three wide, ranged up to the leader leaving the quarter pole, idled in upper stretch allowing the winner to
open the advantage and closed again late in the lane only to be denied. ADDICTED TO LOVE slow early to trail through the turn and showed good late
energy closing down the lane. BRITTANYSGLDNFAITH moved up into contention on the turn and failed to close ground in the stretch. IMAGE RUN rushed
up the fence to take the lead at the half mile pole and weakened on the bend. MINTCHOCOLATECHIP well placed in the early going and steadily faded.
MISS LUV SHACK was never a threat.

Footnotes
GOODBETTERBEST sped to the lead into the first turn, opened a wide advantage down the backstretch, weakened turning for home and held on late. TIZ
ERIN stalked the pacesetter from afar, narrowed the margin through the turn while saving ground along the fence and kept grinding down the lane to gain
the place. SHE'S MAGIC tracked the pace from three wide down the backside, made a threatening bid turning for home and hung down the lane while still
gaining on the winner. ENGLISHED unhurried early to be well off the pace down the backside, waited to mount a rally until straightening out in the lane and
closed with a belated rush. FLURR raced mid-pack along the rail down the backside, waited behind rivals through the turn and made a mild bid down the
lane. CALM COOL made no impact and raced very wide down the lane. SWIGERT well placed to challenge midway on the final bend and weakened turning
for home. MISS DIAMOND RICH was never a threat. DEE DEE B dropped back through the field down the backside and was not a factor.

MOMENT TO SHINE hustled up the fence to set a pressured pace to the head of the lane, responded when called upon in upper stretch and cleared off
convincingly in a well managed ride. CARIBBEAN BEAUTY pressed the pace from between horses into the turn, continued to press the winner to upper
stretch, failed to go with that one and kept on well to hold the place. ANGEL EXPRESS reserved off the pace for the run down the backside, rallied up the
fence cutting the corner turning for home and launched a mild bid through the stretch. SEACHROME showed speed to be on the pace to the turn from three
wide and flattened out. LITURGIA trailed most of the way and never threatened. CASTELMOLA chased the early pace and tired.

CAUMSETT tracked the pace through turn along the fence saving ground, angled three wide turning for home and finished willingly to pull clear. NUMERO
SEIS prompted the pace from two wide, responded when called upon at the head of the lane and was out-finished in the drive. RILEYS REDEMPTION well
placed to make a bid from four wide into the turn, bolted midway on the turn going twelve wide fighting all restraint from the rider, was straightened away in
upper stretch and closed with a rush to be gaining late. BELPERRON reserved off the early pace racing along the fence, lost position through the turn, cut

determined drive. OUR MAJESTIC reserved off the pacesetters to upper stretch, cut the corner coming home and finished well up the rail to just miss.
RUNANDSCORE tracked the pace through the turn. loomed boldly in upper stretch, lugged in on wrong lead to deep stretch and surged late in the drive.
BLACK RAVEN unhurried for the first half mile and finished with a good late rally to be gaining late in the lane. B ADMAN sped to the lead splitting horses,
set the pace to mid-stretch, dug-in when challenged late and could not last in a game effort. MINING CAMP prompted the pace and weakened in the
stretch. TIME ANDBEYOND trailed throughout never posing a threat.
