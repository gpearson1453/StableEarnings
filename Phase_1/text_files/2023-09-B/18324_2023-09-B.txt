Footnotes
LET'S GO PHILLY broke out and brushed an outer foe, tracked in the four path, ranged up to bid midway around the far turn, took the lead while swinging
out to the six path entering the lane, went clear approaching the final sixteenth, and held safe under a drive. LETS GO KOKO brushed with an inner foe at
the start, settled off the pace in the three path, advanced outside of rivals from the five path rounding the far turn, floated out to the eight path into the
stretch, and ran on for place. NUNOFTHISNUNOFTHAT stalked in the two path, was coaxed into the far turn, shifted out to the five path entering the lane,
and kept on for show. TIME MISS broke out at the start, set the pace in the two path, was roused early into the far turn, lost the lead while tipping out to the
three path into the stretch, and faded passing the eighth pole. KIKI broke out at the start then hopped just after, checked early into the first turn, trailed from
the four path down the backstretch, and did not factor. FUTURE FORTUNE broke out at the start, prompted the pace in the three path but backed up
between foes early around the far turn. BAHAMIAN BABY broke out at the start, steadied early around the first turn, rated from the rail thereafter, but
weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
SUPER CURIOSO (ARG) set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. FEDERAL EXCHANGE raced in range four wide, could not match strides
with the winner in upper stretch but stayed to be a clear second. DREAM OF BLESSINGS trailed in the two path, swung widest in upper stretch and was
along for the show. LEOPARDI chased the pace two wide, angled four wide turning for home and lacked the needed rally. ASTRAL WEEKS raced up close
inside and faded in the lane. NATURE BOY prompted the winner in the three path, continued on the left lead in the lane and retreated.

Footnotes
EL PRINCIPITO set the pace in the two path, opened up slightly around the turn, was cued passing the quarter, floated out to the five path into the lane,
stayed on while still on his left lead through the lane, and held sway under a drive. GALIPAN laid up close under a hold in the three path, tipped to the rail
and was roused passing the three eighths, cut the corner into the stretch, and ran on while on his left lead in upper stretch, switched nearing the final
sixteenth, and held place. PRAISEWORTHY was prompted along while in range in the four path, under urging while drifting out to the eight path in upper
stretch, then drifted back inwards while keeping on through the stretch, and lost a minor photo to show. NO PROBLEM JOE chased in the three path, was
driven around the four path rounding the turn, and made no impact while tipping inwards down the stretch. TEXAS AIR FORCE trailed from the two path and
did not threaten around the five path down the lane. WE GOT THIS hopped and hit the outer side of the gate at the start, tracked along the rail but backed
up rounding the turn.

FLY THE W settled off the early pace inside, angled three wide near the three-eighths pole, seized command near the quarter pole and kicked clear in
upper stretch. THE BEST DISTANCE led inside early, tipped two wide when SWASHBUCKLE cleared midway around the first turn, pressed two wide down
the backstretch, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the winner in upper stretch but kept on willingly to gain the place. ROCK THE
STARS settled off the pace while racing two wide, moved up two wide around the far turn and ran on for the show. SWASHBUCKLE moved two wide to the
lead around the first turn, cleared and angled in midway around that bend, led at the rail to the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. WIND NINETY NINE
failed to menace while racing three and four wide. MAKE DECISIONS played no factor while racing two wide. XY TIME chased the pace two wide and
faltered around the far turn. CHESS'S DREAM was outrun while racing three wide around the first turn and saving ground thereafter. WARP SPEED BABY
saved ground in range, angled three wide for the far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
REMINDER prompted the pace from the four path into the backstretch, bid in the three path early around the far turn, took the lead while in the two path at
the top of the stretch, and drew clear under a drive. FREEDOM PRINCIPLE was nudged along from off the pace in the three path, driven from said position
turning into the lane, and kept on to get up for place. PAPALOTE set the pace in the three path, was roused from the two path into the far turn, lost the lead
along the inside entering the stretch, then lost the whip nearing the eighth pole, and flattened out for show. GRAND TOWER took a small hop at the start,
stalked inside of foes in the two path, was under coaxing while tipping out to the four path midway around the far turn, but faded in the stretch.
REVELATORY chased in the five path, was put to coaxing passing the five-eighths point, but failed to menace. SUMMER STORM STRIC had an awkward
start, trailed from the five path into the backstretch and could never get involved.

Footnotes
LORD EDDARD STARK brushed with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the two path, was put to a drive from the three path going into the far turn, ranged
up and bid in the four path at the top of the lane, swept past an inner trio while remaining on his left lead passing the eighth pole, and was driven out.
STARSHIP WIZARD chased in the four path, was under right handed encouragement from said position rounding the far turn, angled out to the six path in
upper stretch, and rallied past an inner trio for place. CAPTAIN ANTHONY was bumped by an outer foe into an inner foe at the start, rated in the two path,
was roused into the far turn, split rivals to bid in in the two path entering the stretch, but evened out for show. CHAINA bobbled and bumped an inner foe at
the start, set the pace from inside into the backstretch, was cued into the far turn, dug in from the rail in upper stretch, but flattened passing the eighth pole.
STERLING HARMONY brushed with an inner foe then an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, bid midway around the far turn, was
cued passing the quarter, but faded around the four path down the stretch. THE MAR trailed in the three path down the backside and never threatened.
STREET GLIDE stalked in the five path but backed up going into the far turn.
