THE LAST FACT was urged along to share the lead outside ST. LOUIE LOUIE, moved clear after two furlongs, saved ground through the bend and held
sway under urging in the lane. ST. LOUIE LOUIE vied for the lead from inside, did not keep up after a quarter mile, was two wide on the turn, lugged in
some to bump ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS with a sixteenth left, jostled with the latter through the waning yards and came up short for the win.
ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS was settled inside, picked up his pace after two furlong, progressed along the rail, found himself boxed in behind THE LAST
FACT in the stretch, was bumped with a sixteenth to go, altered out some in the late going, jostled with ST. LOUIE LOIUIE to the wire while finishing on
even terms with that one. HIGHLY PERFECT soon trailed, was taken to the outside midway on the backstretch, widest through the bend and rallied
belatedly in the lane. MAN ON ATTACK raced in contention from outside, was three wide taking the turn then flattened out for the drive.

COOKIN ROSES was urged to a clear lead and the inside, widened command on the bend, floated out some entering the lane, drifted out under left-handed
pressure deep stretch but kept VIVA VIOLENCE at bay. VIVA VIOLENCE advanced from inside on the turn to move clear for second, fanned outside
COOKIN ROSES into the stretch, gradually angled out as the latter came out in the late going and lacked the extra needed in the waning yards. TWO
MORE TIMES chased from outside on the backstretch, progressed from inside on the bend, moved clear for third upper stretch then could only make up
minor ground the last eighth. RANK AND FILE in contention early three wide, failed to keep up on the turn and rallied belatedly widest in the lane.
DEAUVILLE MIST prominent just outside COOKIN ROSES from the early going, did not keep up on the bend, fanned out behind VIVA VIOLENCE entering
the lane and also found best stride too late. BAILESTON LASSIE stayed well off the inside and showed little.

SUPERTRIX rated off the early speed, was three wide on the second bend, fanned out further entering the lane, was forced out some upper stretch, jostled
repeatedly with GHAALEB'S DREAMS as those two were making their bid, gained a narrow advantage at the sixteenth marker then slowly edged ahead
nearing the wire. CLOSE TO ME progressed from outside through the first turn, angled in some on the backstretch, was two wide taking the second turn,
drifted out slightly once straightened in the stretch, dueled for the lead between rivals the final sixteenth but lacked the needed late kick. MARIA'S GIFT was
a step slow then caught in tight quarters at the break, settled inside, angled out midway on the backstretch, lost ground widest through the second bend,
drifted out some midstretch, rallied the final furlong and drifted out gradually through the waning yards. GHAALEB'S DREAMS raced in contention just off
the rail, swung out to path three entering the lane, altered outside CLOSE TO ME at the top of the stretch, crowding SUPERTRIX, jostled repeatedly with
that one as she made her bid and did not have enough nearing the finish. BOBBIE TOO TOO broke alertly and was quickly clear, showed the way in hand
from inside, was challenged on the second turn, shook free upper stretch but gradually wore down in the late going. There was a stewards' inquiry into the
jostling between SUPERTRIK and GHAALEB'S DREAMS in the stretch run. After their review, no action was taken.

MEDAL OF FACT was sent to share the early lead from outside, was two wide on the bend, took over as he drifted out to path six entering the lane, moved
clear inside the last eighth, began to wear down the final sixteenth but kept D' YANK at bay. D' YANK chased from inside, swung out to path four into the
stretch, surged inside the final furlong, gained second seventy yards out and came up short for the win. FULL MAGAZINE prominent behind the early
speed, threatened three wide on the bend, was carried out by MEDAL OF FACT into the stretch and was drifting out in the waning yards. CREEKMORE
was hustled along to dispute the pace from inside, lost the advantage as he floated out leaving the turn and gradually yielded for the drive.
SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY forwardly placed from outside, improved position four wide on the bend, drifted out leaving leaving the turn and did not recover.
GINSBURNED displayed early speed between horses but began to fade after three furlongs.

Footnotes
XPRESSIR crowded leaving the chute, moved clear midway on the backstretch, was roused with two furlongs to go, lengthened command upper stretch,
bore out under left-handed pressure after entering the last eighth, held a straight path the final sixteenth and maintained full control. SPAN reluctant to load,
was hustled along early, lost ground four to six wide through the bend, rallied through the lane, was too late but caught ITS MAMBO for second. ITS
MAMBO chased from not far off the rail, waited for room behind a wall of horses approaching the end of a half mile, altered to the rail leaving the quarter
pole, squeezed through to rallied in the stretch, had second inside the final furlong, leveled off in the late going but was easily best of the rest. GRAYHOP
broke slowly and inward, saved ground taking the turn, altered out upper stretch and weaved in and out through traffic to advance the last eighth. SMOOTH
ATTACK broke inward, was hustled along between rivals, moved clear for second just off the inside on the bend, floated out to path four into the lane, was
no match for XPRESSIR and gave way the last eighth. FLYING CRICKET in midpack early, moved to the inside after two furlongs, squeezed through tight
quarters between horses leaving the quarter pole, came three wide into the stretch and had no late bid. PONCHO ATTACK also in midpack early from
outside, was three to five wide taking the turn and gave way for the drive. FAST KYLIE prominent early, failed to keep up along the rail on the bend, floated
out some leaving the turn and quickly faded.

rail leaving the turn, got through three wide upper stretch, angled out some as DEVIL'S TOWER came out inside the final furlong, came up short at the end
but caught HELA for second nearing the wire. HELA gradually progressed from inside to threaten with a furlong to go, leveled off instead but was clearly
best of the others. W W CRAZY in contention early, failed to keep up three wide on the bend, passed a couple tired horses upper stretch then leveled off.
SEMINOLE BEACH broke outward, bumping HUEY ATTACK, vied for the lead toward the outside, lost ground five then six wide through the turn, faded and
drifted out midstretch. ONE PUTT RICHIE contested the pace between rivals, was in tight quarters on the bend, floated out slightly as he began to fade

Footnotes
SALLY'S SUPRISE was sent to vie for the early lead, had the rail on the turn, floated out some entering the lane, drifted out briefly upper stretch as she
drew off under urging, kept a straight path the last furlong and proved much the best. FREE LOVE contested the pace outside SALLY'S SUPRISE for a half
mile, was no match for that one when set down for the drive but was unchallenged for the place. MAYSTART in contention early between rivals, failed to
keep up along the rail on the bend, battled for third just off the inside deep stretch and got it late. GHAALEB'S RANGER soon trailed, was three wide on the
turn, fanned out some for the drive and showed a willingness to run deep stretch between foes. DELTA LADY forwardly placed from inside on the
backstretch, failed to stay close on the bend, swung out leaving the turn, came three wide into the lane, altered outside GHAALEB'S RANGER inside the
last eighth and was making up ground on that one in the waning yards. FOGGY KITTEN pressed the early speed from just off the rail, angled out through
the turn, was five wide entering the stretch and gradually wore down the final furlong. AWESOME SUNDAY flipped in the gate before the start, was taken
out and given the okay to race from the veterinarian after examination, was an early contender from outside but gave way four wide on the bend.
