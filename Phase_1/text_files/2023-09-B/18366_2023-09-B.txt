the pace five furlongs, could not stall the winner but held second. COLTON'S TIGER pressed the pace two wide to the second turn then was outkicked to
the stretch and did not rally. SMOKENSILVER had no speed, settled for three eighths while two wide but lacked a closing response. NEATAPAR chased the
pace for a half mile then weakened. COLE'S DYNAMITE had no speed and was not a factor. MR MAKUNOUCHI broke slow and trailed throughout.

IN THE VAULT was never far back, rallied down the backstretch, drew even on the second turn then inched away in the drive. FRISCO FRILLS set the pace
from the rail to the second turn, could not stall the winner then held the place. BETHEL RIDGE was outsprinted to the backstretch, bid three wide to the
stretch and was gaining in the late stages. COWLITZ pressed the pace to the backstretch, got outkicked on the second turn and weakened.
GALWALKSINTOABAR had no speed while two wide and was never a threat. LUCINDA RELLA broke a bit slow then saved ground to no avail. LAFONDA
also had no speed and was outrun. MY LITE NITE was three or four wide throughout and not a factor.

Footnotes
GET MY POINT chased the pace to the backstretch, advanced to the second turn, rallied two wide to the stretch then closed steadily to be there. CAMDEN
HIGH was outsprinted, closed the gap on the backstretch, came three wide to the stretch and made a late run for second. BABY CHOCOLATE had good
speed but bore out badly early, was corrected and set the pace to the second turn, was overtaken into the stretch and tired. FLY PATTI FLY was pinched off
by BABY CHOCOLATE in the early stages, checked then chased to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response.
WARNING SOUND had no speed, settled to the three eighths then was three wide to the stretch but did not threaten. SWEET MEG also had no early
speed, commenced a bid nearing the second turn, had to angle out for room into the stretch and was gaining late. LILY PAD LAKE got outsprinted then
saved ground to no avail. OUR GIRL ASHLEY had no speed and was not a factor. SPORTS FOR WOMEN was always outrun.

Footnotes
RODEO ROSE was outsprinted early, closed the gap to the second turn, rallied two wide to be on terms into the stretch then dug in gamely to prevail. LADY
BRETT set the pace, saved ground to the stretch then could not stall the winner. QUEENSBORO chased the leader, was asked three wide to the stretch
and closed belatedly. SUE GENEROUS pressed the pace early, was outkicked to the second turn and weakened. GREAT CURVES had no speed and did
not threaten. LUVAHAPPYENDING also had no speed and was outrun. RESERVOIR chased the pace four wide but weakened on the second turn.
ELECTRIC ELIZABETA saved ground to no avail. HEY WILMAAA hesitated, broke very slow then was very rank, gave up over ten lengths to the field and
lost any chance.
