LATE FOR LUNCH was off a step slow at the start then moved up the inside and raced just off the leader, took over the lead near the half mile marker, held
clear around the turn, saved ground entering the lane and kept to task. KNIGHT COMMANDER tracked the top trio in early stages three wide, gained on the
inside around the turn then tipped two to three wide for the drive, could not reach the winner but finished clearly second best. SECRET BLARNEY raced off
the early pace, made a wide move to avoid pulling up horse around the turn, swung six to seven wide into upper stretch and got up late for show. RED
WHITE AND LOUD stalked the top pair in early stages, got carried out wide by pulling up rival mid-way around the turn and lost ground, shifted back in a
few paths and got edged late for show. SNAP'N TAP raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn and lacked a rally. MAHOMES raced off the
pace, came two wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. COWBOY CASANOVA raced up close through early stages, pulled up around the turn and
vanned off. THE STEWARDS POSTED INQUIRY LOOKING INTO THE TURN WHICH RESULTED IN NO ACTION

OCEAN RIDE stalked the top pair through early stages, came under a ride three wide near the quarter pole, gathered momentum under right handed
pressure a furlong out, stayed on determinedly and got up late. GOLDEN LUNA tracked the leader into the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, given cue
approaching the furlong marker, steadily edged up closer and got denied in closing strides. LOVER BOY set the early pace, saved ground entering the lane,
dug in determinedly holding onto a diminishing lead late and got overtaken nearing the wire. REPLETE raced near midpack, chased two wide into upper
stretch, tipped three wide for the drive and kept on for a minor share. BLUESKIESANDANGELS raced off the early pace, swung four wide into upper stretch
and had a mild improve. NEW STRIPE raced off the pace, came wide into stretch and never menaced. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP chased in range along the
inside, cut the corner entering the lane then retreated.

WEST SIDE GIRL pressed the pace around the first turn then took over the lead and led the way up the backstretch, widened advantage in hand around the
far turn, came two wide into upper stretch, tapped twice right handed in the final furlong and drew off to an easy score. JERI DAWN was unhurried through
early stages, picked up the tempo on the rail around the far turn, advanced into contention, was no match for pulling away winner but sustained bid and
cleared second best. REBEL RISING tracked the pace around the first turn and remained forwardly placed up the backstretch, was ridden along two wide
around the far turn, stayed on two to three wide into the lane and cleared the rest. REINA DEL SUR tracked the top trio up the backstretch, chased three to

the backstretch, came up empty around the final turn and continued to tire in the drive.

MEDICINE TAIL sped to a slim lead soon after the start and led the way under a bit of pressure, held clear along the inside around the turn, hustled up two
wide into upper stretch, responded gamely and drew off. GERARD was forwardly placed soon after the start, was ridden along three wide in close range
around the turn, angled in a path turning for home, was no match for pulling away winner but sustained a steady two wide bid and finished second best.
BROADWAY PETE rated just off the leaders in early stages, made a move three to four wide late on the turn, circled up into contention and got edged late
for place. TIZHOTNDUSTY raced in range along the inside, saved ground around the turn, ran on upper stretch then flattened the final furlong. BUZZER
raced in the back, swung five wide into the lane and had no response. SAILOR CHOW pressed the early pace, remained up close around the turn then tired
in the drive.

under right handed pressure and finished going away. WICKLOW LADDIE raced off the top trio in early stages, hustled up two wide around the turn,
sustained a bid near the inside through the lane and cleared second best. GUNPOWDER N' LEAD raced in or near the back, saved ground around the turn,
roused along the rail through the lane, showed response and secured a share. FLEETWOOD SMACK got bumped between rivals at the start but broke out
near the lead, vied briefly then pressed the early pace, continued up close around the turn, floated four wide into upper stretch then steadily weakened. DO
IT LIKE KEVIN raced off the early pace, came three wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. KICKIN' CHARLIE raced up close three wide in early

Footnotes
ESPIRIDION tracked the top trio in the early going, circled up three wide into contention near the quarter pole, launched a bid at the head of the lane,
steadily edged up closer and cleared late. HARD SPIRITS raced off the early pace, gained ground along the rail around the turn, tipped three wide upper
stretch, sustained bid and got a nose up for place. MY FIRING LINE took over the lead after opening stages and angled to the inside, set the pace and held
firm around the turn, came under a ride upper stretch, could not hold off the winner nearing the wire and got nipped for place. THE AWFUL TRUTH raced in
the back, saved ground around the turn and lacked a rally in the lane. C L LEGACY raced in early contention, chased three wide around the turn then faded
in the lane. SONG OF PRAISE held a slight edge then steadied behind the tote board and lost some ground, remained in striking distance through the
backstretch then came up empty around the turn.

Footnotes
ELIOT NESS sped to the lead soon after the start and led the way up the backstretch, held firm around the turn, saved ground turning for home, roused for
more upper stretch, had more left in the tank, dug in gamely with pursuers closing in, held off bids and prevailed under an all out drive. A BRUSH OF LUCK
raced off the top trio in the opening quarter, moved up closer late on the turn, launched a three wide bid at the head of the lane, moved up into striking
distance, could not reach the game winner but got by for second best. ROCKIN THE DAD BOD tracked in contention up the backstretch, waited for a clear
path along the inside midway around the turn, got clear at the quarter pole then briefly had to wait two wide in traffic at the head of the lane, got clear,
roused forward into striking distance between rivals then yielded late. DREADPIRATEROBERTS raced off the early pace, swung four wide into upper
stretch and had a mild improve. WOKE UP IN LOVE settled off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, briefly gained closer contention along the rail
to the furlong marker then flattened out. UNCLE SINGH was forwardly placed and chased the leader up the backstretch, sustained bid around the turn then
retreated in the lane.
