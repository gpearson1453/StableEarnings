Footnotes
GET'EM TIGER was forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the decent early pace into the turn, advanced to press the pace to the quarter marker,
drew to even terms with MAYCEE JO inside of the furlong pole, battled with that rival to deep stretch, took a narrow lead in the final yards and held well at
the finish to determinedly prevail. MAYCEE JO broke alertly, showed speed in the early stages and set the pace to the turn, was pressed along the bend by
GET'EM TIGER, held a narrow advantage on that rival into the stretch, met the bid of GET'EM TIGER inside of the furlong pole, gamely battled to deep
stretch and just missed at the wire, while well clear of the rest for second. MISS SKI tracked the early pace from the inside, chased the leading pair along
the turn, was not able to make headway on the leaders in the stretch and held for third at the finish. BIG GIFT was a bit slow into stride early on and settled
off of the early pace, was roused three wide heading to the quarter marker, was floated out at mid-stretch when BLUSHING BAY lost action, made a mild
rally in deep stretch and just missed for third. GOING TO SHABOOMS settled off of the early pace, chased two wide to the quarter marker and did not
factor. BLUSHING BAY was crowded a bit at the start and was off a step slowly, tracked the early pace while outside of rivals, lost ground on the turn while
two wide, lost action into the stretch, was pulled up at the furlong marker and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
BLUEBERRY MUFFIN broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, had the margin
cut into a bit along the far turn, was set down in upper stretch and drew clear at the furlong marker, was kept to task while on the left lead into the final
sixteenth and held safely in a drive to prevail. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the moderate fractions through the
backstretch run, improved position while two wide on the far turn, lost ground to BLUEBERRY MUFFIN into the stretch, was able to make up ground on the
winner in the late stages but could not reel that one in and held for second at the finish. SHANGHAI MIST took back off of the early pace, came in a bit tight
entering the first turn and was floated three wide leaving the seven-eighths marker, settled through the backstretch run, improved position while outside of
rivals along the far turn, mounted a five wide rally into the stretch, finished well in the final stages and just missed for second, while holding safely for third.
DUST MAKER settled inside of rivals leaving the break, was a bit hard to place entering the first turn and was shuffled back at the seven-eighths marker,
was steered to the two path into the backstretch run and was unhurried to the half-mile pole, came three wide to the quarter marker, improved position into
the stretch and closed willingly in the final stages. MISTY CAT tracked the early pace while outside of rivals and came three wide into the backstretch run,
was well positioned while two wide into the far turn, needed more in the stretch run and finished evenly in the final stages. AIRKITA was forwardly placed
into the first turn and tracked the early pace from the inside, saved all of the ground to the second turn, chased the top two into the stretch and flattened out
in the final furlong. LYINATTHEBAR was a bit hard to place in the early running and drifted out entering the first turn, settled in the two path into the
backstretch run, lost position at the half-mile marker and did not factor. BLOSSOMING settled outside of runners leaving the break, checked in tight quarters
entering the first turn and tracked the pace four wide into the backstretch run, improved position heading to the half-mile marker and was well placed into the
far turn, raced within aim while three then four wide nearing the top of the stretch, could not keep pace into the drive and gave way.

Footnotes
BOLD MISTRESS was asked for early speed and was prominent away from the gate, stalked the solid pace while two wide into the turn, gained ground
heading to the quarter marker, made a steady advance on DAWN AT LAST into upper stretch and confronted that rival inside of the furlong marker, drew to
even terms then took a narrow lead at the the sixteenth-pole, battled with DAWN AT LAST to the final yards and determinedly held over the game
runner-up. DAWN AT LAST was sent leaving an alert beginning and dictated terms in the early running, set a fast pace into the turn and carved quick
fractions to the quarter marker, was confronted by BOLD MISTRESS at the furlong marker, battled inside of that rival to the sixteenth-pole, lost the lead into
deep stretch, gamely came again in the final yards and just missed for the win at the finish, while holding for the place. JAYS ANGEL was forwardly placed
in the early running and tracked the quick pace while outside of rivals, chased three wide along the turn and lost ground into the stretch, re-rallied inside of
the furlong marker, finished well in deep stretch and missed for the win and place, while holding safely for the show. BACALAR bobbled at the start and was
off a step slowly, chased the solid early pace from the inside, tipped two wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, lacked the needed response
in the final stages and was outkicked. LION'S LAIR lacked early speed and settled along the inside into the turn, was coaxed along four wide into the stretch
and offered mild late rally while on the left lead. ZAKKIYYAH tracked the solid pace while outside of rivals, chased three wide to the quarter marker, lost
ground into the stretch and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
A CROWN FOR KITTEN unhurried from the break and allowed to settle on the rail, got a dream trip down the backstretch, moved into contention in hand
through the far turn, tipped out to the two path for the stretch run, responded when roused at the top of the stretch and proved too much for the rest despite
wandering a bit in mid-stretch. CALLHERCONTESSA broke in at the start, bothering UNFAITHFUL WAYS, a few strides later overcorrected into the path of
WARRIOR'S MOON, then had to steady when PRINCESA DEL TIGRE took the path at the junction to the main course, tracked the pace three deep to the
far turn, started to rally from the three furlong pole, fanned four wide into the stretch and rallied for the second spot. UNFAITHFUL WAYS had to check
briefly just after the start then was content to trail well behind the field through the early stages, began to move closer down the backstretch, then rallied in
earnest with three furlongs to go, kept to the inside through the turn, had to idle in traffic mid-stretch, found room along the rail and ran on well to grab third.
PROOF OF JAZZ broke well, gained the lead through the first turn and proceeded uncontested until the far turn, responded when challenged with a quarter
mile to run, had a little trouble changing leads at the top of the stretch and was outfinished in the final furlong. PRINCESA DEL TIGRE broke out at the start
then went to challenge for the lead , angled over sharply near the end of the chute causing CALLHERCONTESSA to have to take up, was dueling for the
lead going into the clubhouse turn then ceded the pacesetting duties to PROOF OF JAZZ, stalked that one two deep down the backstretch under some
restraint, bid approaching the quarter-mile marker but could not produce the needed response. WARRIOR'S MOON showed little speed from the break,
raced well behind the pace to the far turn, came under a ride from the three-furlong marker, was able to keep pace with the pack down the stretch but
unable to improve position.

Footnotes
ASSUREDLY broke well and first into stride, allowed CRY ME A RUNNER to take over the lead after a furlong, stalked that one through the turn, was set
down at the top of the stretch and doggedly wore down the leader to prevail. CRY ME A RUNNER broke sharply, dueled for a furlong with ASSUREDLY
then cleared off going into the turn, was still going well in hand at the top of the stretch, responded when roused and ran on well but weakened a bit in the
final yards and could not hold off the winner. NOT NOW I'M BIZZIE broke slowly then veered outward after the break, chased the field to the turn, began an
inside rally from the three-eighths pole, finished up well enough to gain the third spot while never a threat to the top pair. GETAWAY CHARM broke a step
behind the dueling leaders, found a good rhythm and joined the pace going into the turn, came under pressure near the five-sixteenths pole and was unable
to keep up down the stretch.

VALENCE was away in good order, rated nicely off of the early pace and stalked four wide into the first turn, slipped over a path and came three wide into
the backstretch run, was well placed heading to the half-mile marker and gained ground at the quarter pole, maintained that three wide path into the stretch
and improved position at the furlong grounds, responded to urging and vied for the lead while between rivals nearing the sixteenth-pole, took command into
deep stretch, found more in the final stages and drew away at the finish. R SWEET CANDY was allowed to settle leaving the break, drifted out entering the
first turn and floated out MS LIMONCELLO leaving the seven furlong marker, tracked the pace two wide into the backstretch run, was guided outside of
rivals along the far turn and improved position while four wide at the quarter marker, continued that four wide bid into the stretch, vied for the lead inside of
the furlong marker, could not match strides with VALENCE in deep stretch and was outfinished, while holding safely at the end for second. MS
LIMONCELLO was crowded a bit at the start, was off a step slowly and was allowed to settle while outside of runners in the early going, was floated four
wide entering the first turn, recovered and came three wide into the backstretch run, held her position to the half-mile marker, was steered two wide into the
far turn and encountered traffic nearing the quarter marker, found a seam and raced three wide into the stretch, rallied well in the final sixteenth and was up
in the final strides to secure third. ACCLAIMED PREACHER took back off of the early pace and tracked from the second flight into the first turn, tracked
three wide into the backstretch run, was well placed heading to the quarter marker, loomed three wide nearing the quarter pole, vied for the lead in upper
stretch then took command approaching the furlong marker, was overtaken in in the final sixteenth, weakened in deep stretch and was just edged for third in
the final strides. UNION HEIRESS settled off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, tracked from the inside through the backstretch run,
gained ground along the far turn, waited for racing room while two wide nearing the quarter marker, found room into upper stretch and ran evenly to the
furlong marker, lacked the needed response in the final stages and passed tiring rivals in deep stretch. VHAGAR was squeezed at the start, clipped heels
and spotted the field several lengths in the early going, settled along the rail into the first turn, trailed through the backstretch run, improved position while
five wide along the far turn, continued that bid into the stretch, could not sustain her rally into the final furlong and flattened out. DESERT RUMBLE broke in
at the start, was forwardly placed in the early stages and stalked the pace while two wide on the first turn, advanced to attend to the decent pace through the
backstretch run, confronted MIRAGE CODE along the far turn and vied for the lead at the quarter marker, took command into the stretch, was overtaken by
ACCLAIMED PREACHER heading to the furlong marker, was outrun into the final sixteenth and tired. BROOKYS GAL tracked the decent early pace from
the inside, was steered to the two path entering the far turn, could not keep pace approaching the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages. MIRAGE
CODE was asked for early speed, assumed command and sped to the lead into the first turn, set decent fractions through the backstretch run, was
confronted nearing the quarter marker, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
MORNING ADDICTION hustled for the lead and opened up a length clear passing the five furlong marker, was then pressed by TURA LURA and
immediately sprinted clear into the turn, opened up a four to five length lead then stopped suddenly approaching the five-sixteenths pole, fell back to last,
perked up in the stretch, re-rallied near the furlong marker, split horses passing the sixteenth pole and took the lead in the final yards. MAJESTIC OOPS
was up on the pace through the first furlong then dropped off the pace before the turn, came under a ride from the three furlong marker, turned for home
with only one beaten, swung out in mid-stretch for clear run and surged in the late stages to gain the place. SWIFT NONNI broke out slightly and made
mutual light contact with CHARLOTTE HARBOR, raced out in the four path but close up with the tracking group, made a bid for the lead at the top of the
lane, raced on the wrong lead for most of the stretch run but kept on and just missed. TURA LURA was up on the pace in the early stages, then raced
between horses chasing the pacesetter, was suddenly dueling for the lead when that foe dropped out of the race passing the five sixteenths pole, went on to
battle a game CRYSTAL PROOF to deep stretch, got the better of that one inside the sixteenth marker but could not hold. CRYSTAL PROOF bobbled at
the break, but was quickly into stride and up on the pace early, inherited the the lead near the five-sixteenth marker when MORNING ADDICITION stopped
running, battled TURA LURA to deep stretch, weakened inside the sixteenth pole and was outfinished. CHARLOTTE HARBOR broke in and brushed with
SWIFT NONNI after the break, dropped well behind the field and chased to the turn, tried to rally racing three wide through the turn but was unable to make
an impact.

Footnotes
SILENT POET broke alertly and assumed command in the early stages, showed the way into the first turn and set moderate fractions while well rated
through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker and battled with LAMMAS into the stretch, turned away that rival inside of the
furlong marker, responded to firm urging into deep stretch and drew clear in the final stages. LAMMAS (GB) was forwardly placed away from the start, rated
nicely and settled in the second flight while two wide along the first turn, was well placed through the backstretch run, was guided to the four path heading
into the far turn, loomed at the quarter marker and battled for the lead into upper stretch, dueled with SILENT POET to the furlong marker, was turned away
by SILENT POET approaching the sixteenth-marker and held for second at the finish. TESORO was unhurried leaving the break and saved ground into the
first turn, settled along the backstretch run and was guided to the two path approaching the far turn, made a steady gain heading to the quarter marker and
angled four wide for the stretch drive, continued to gain ground into mid-stretch, could not make headway on the top two into deep stretch and was
outkicked, while holding for third. KERRY GOLD was forwardly placed into the first turn and stalked the moderate pace while saving ground through the
backstretch run, lost position into the far turn and waited for racing room while along the inside nearing the quarter marker, remained in traffic into upper
stretch, found a seam nearing the furlong pole, offered a mild late bid in deep stretch and missed for third. AMERICAN FARMER was unhurried leaving the
start and tucked in to the two path entering the first turn, was content to trail through the backstretch run while not far back, was roused three wide into the
far turn, swung five wide for the stretch drive and gained ground at the furlong marker, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and finished evenly.
I'MGONNABESOMEBODY was asked for speed away from the gate, was forwardly placed early on and stalked the moderate pace while two wide along
the first turn, attended to the pace through the backstretch and gained ground heading to the half-mile marker, came in a bit tight while along the rail nearing
the quarter pole, chased the leaders into upper stretch, could not keep pace at the furlong grounds and weakened in deep stretch. ROYAL 'N RANDO
settled outside of runners into the first turn, raced three wide into the backstretch run and improved position nearing the half-mile marker, mounted a three
wide bid at the quarter pole, was coaxed along four wide into the stretch, was outrun to the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages. AMERICA
GREAT showed speed leaving the start and was prominent into the first turn, stalked the moderate pace while three wide into the backstretch run, gained
ground heading to the half-mile marker, advanced along the far turn and pressed SILENT POET to the quarter pole, dropped back into the stretch and tired
in the final furlong.

DON'T TELL HYDEE broke well and pressed the pace to the outside of MORO FIRST CLASS, was always traveling well, took over the lead at the top of the
stretch, opened up under strong handling at the furlong marker, was kept to task under firm urging to deep stretch and lasted at the finish. MADAME
GAZELLE allowed the pace to develop up front while being kept close, bid between horses on the turn, swung three wide into the stretch and produced a
good run down the lane but came up short. DRAW NEAR pulled the rider into contention racing on the rail, let the leaders slip away a bit near the
five-sixteenths pole, tried to come back under heavy pressure and ran on to gain the third spot. TIZ A TIGER raced near the rear of the compact field while
three to four wide throughout, tried to rally through the turn and kept on through the lane but was unable to improve position. MORO FIRST CLASS broke
well and dueled through the early stages with DON'T TELL HYDEE, battled that rival through the turn then weakened and gave way at the top of the stretch.
