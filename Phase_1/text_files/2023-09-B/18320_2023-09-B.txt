LUCKY SHORE well rated to far turn off rail, ran on steadily to gallop past and clear late. SHE'S A KEEPER sprinted away to a long lead, held to the
stretch, outkicked late. PRETTY HEART chased leader throughout to no avail, settling for the show spot. BIA BOLT RUNNER no early speed trailed to far
turn, finished up well in the lane. WANNAGOCAMPING no speed to far turn and cut the gap in the stretch. DEESSE raced along evenly to the stretch while
closing the gap late. THREE POINT KUZ ran on evenly with no response when needed. MISS MATCHMAKER never prominent throughout. CORIMA
through early, dropped back readily. GET CLEAR never factored. Race was hand timed due to a bad sensor on the turf course, all turf races will be hand
