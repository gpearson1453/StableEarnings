Footnotes
FELINE prompted the pace in the three path, bid under a ride midway around the turn, dueled with the inner pacesetter from the three path into the stretch,
inched away inside the final furlong, took an awkward step just before the wire, held on, and was vanned off. MEGAN MAKIN MONEY set the pace in the
two path, was challenged by an outer foe midway around the turn, dug in from the two path to hold onto the lead into the final furlong, but faded in the final
sixteenth to place. CYMBAL COURT stalked along the rail, tipped out under coaxing around the turn, and kept on from the five path in the stretch for show.
BURN THE BREEZE chased in the four path, floated out to the eight path turning into the lane, and finished evenly. ONE SMOKIN' RITA bumped at the
start with an outer foe, raced off the pace in the two path, swung out to the five path under a drive turning into the stretch, but was no factor. STARSHIP
VANITY trailed in the three path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, but did not threaten. FREE CRISTINA bumped with an inner foe at the
start, rated in the two path but was no menace.

Footnotes
ORB ALPHA settled off the early pace inside, raced in the three path around most of the turn, fanned four wide turning for home, closed outside, was up
nearing the sixteenth pole and drew off under a drive. CACIQUE ABARRIO set the pace in the two path, was collared nearing the sixteenth pole and was
clearly second best. T B TWELVE ALWAYS stalked the pace two and three wide, lacked the needed rally but stayed on well enough to hold well clear of the
rest. BEE A SKY BEAM saved ground and failed to menace. MACUTO played no factor while racing two wide. JAKE'S AFFECTION had only brief speed
four wide.

Footnotes
THE GREAT CESAR rated in the two path, was ridden along the rail rounding the turn, shifted out to the five path turning into the lane, and drew past the
inner pacesetter around the final sixteenth. PEACH NECTAR set the pace in the two path, was under coaxing midway around the turn, floated out to the
four path into the stretch, and was caught around the final sixteenth to place. JOYFUL SURPRISE trailed along the rail, angled out under a ride around the
turn, was out in the nine path at the top of the stretch, and finished evenly for show. WARLORD CRUZAN prompted the pace in the five path, bid under a
drive from the four path rounding the turn, floated out to the seven path entering the stretch, but faded. GREENPOINT broke thru the gate during the loading
process, pressed in the four path, was coaxed between foes in the three path rounding the turn, but weakened in the stretch. WORLDLY MANNER chased
in the five path but was no menace.

Footnotes
OMAHA GIRL was bumped at the start, set the pace in the two path and widened under a drive. KISS prompted the winner in the three path, angled in in
upper stretch, could not gain on the winner but outfinished her stablemate for the place. HEPBURN settled off the early pace outside, advanced four wide
around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and flattened out. SPECIAL AFFAIR failed to menace while racing three wide. GOOD BRIGHT
FLAMES was bumped between foes at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. JUST TAKE NOTES broke outwardly and bumped foes at the start,
tracked the pace from the inside and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
ENSIGN SKIP was reluctant to load and fractious in the gate, stalked in the four path, got put under a drive in the three path early around the far turn,
remained on his left lead entering the lane, but surged between foes to get up in the closing stages. RULE IT settled in midpack in the three path, was cued
between foes early around the far turn, floated out to the five path in upper stretch, lost the whip inside the final sixteenth, but ran on for place. NOBLE AND
KIND set an open pace in the two path, extended his advantage under coaxing turning into the lane, and kept on, but was caught by a pair of outer foes late
to show. AWESOME CITY broke in at the start, raced wellback in the four path, was ridden between foes into the far turn, tipped out to the seven path
entering the stretch, and stayed on. KADAR INDY hopped at the start, pulled while off the pace in the two path, was cued into the far turn, split foes while
swinging out to the four path into the lane, but flattened. WESTUN TIME tracked along the rail but faded in the stretch. BULLETONTHECHARTS rated in
the five path but made no impact. MUCHOMACHOMAC steadied at the start, trailed in the five path, had to steady again early down the backstretch, was
under right handed encouragement in the six path rounding the far turn, but was tired in the nine path entering the stretch.
