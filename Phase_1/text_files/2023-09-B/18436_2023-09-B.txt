furlong marker and closed well to get up late, driving. SHATTER ME was away alertly to set the pace early, pressured on the turn, shook clear leaving the
turn but was caught late, good effort. TRIXIE'S TIME was rated three wide, swung out five wide leaving the turn and rallied but needed more late. QUEEN'S
DREAM was rated on the inside, made a two wide bid off the turn but hung late, missed show. ZIPPY JO tracked the pace on the inside, eased off the
inside by the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane and was empty. MACRELLETTA prompted the pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to

Footnotes
WORST BEHAVIOUR was rated two wide, split rivals leaving the three sixteenths, then closed between rivals to get up late to prove best, driving. CHARM
ALARM was allowed to settle early, advanced four wide by the quarter pole, came wide into the lane and finished well but was outfinished by the winner.
NEWSDLEY set a pressured pace on the inside, dug in gamely in the stretch but was out-kicked late to just fail. JACK'S LILLY was reserved early towards
the inside, angled out in the lane and had a late rally to finish on even terms for the last spot in the superfecta. BOWTOTHEQUEEN was settled three wide,
made a four wide move on the turn and came five wide into the lane but hung late, even terms for superfecta. POSITIVE FORCE chased the pace on the
inside but lacked the needed winning bid. AMEN SYLVIA was settled back early and lacked a solid rally. ME DARLIN KATHLEEN pressed the pace three
wide and made a bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive.

CHAPA set the pace on the inside, then remained clear off the turn and then maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best while being kept to crop
urging. BANJO stalked the pace three wide and finished willingly but could not get to his barn mate while being clearly second best.
LETSGETLUCKYTONITE was settled early between rivals, then dropped to the inside by the quarter pole and had a mild late rally, bested rest. BULLET
BREEZE was settled on the inside early, dropped back, swung wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally. MAKE ME LUCKY was settled on the outside,
four wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. SHARP STYLE chased the early pace, three wide by the quarter pole and weakened.
PRALINESALLSHOOKUP stalked the early pace on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
WAHINE MEANIE stalked the pace two wide and made a three wide bid on the turn, edged away in the furlong grounds to prove best under a drive.
DOCTOR TEE set the pace from the inside, headed nearing the furlong marker, kept on willingly but could not go with the winner late, second best. A J'S
TOWN was settled early, made a four wide move on the turn, but flattened out in the final furlong, held show. CHIMING IN chased the pace on the inside
and weakened the final furlong. TRAJEC HOLIDAY was away alertly, stalked the pace three wide and weakened. MADISON COUNTY was settled early,
two to three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. MISS MIA LIA was reserved on the inside and failed to menace. FAIRVIEW stumbled at the start and was
not a factor.
