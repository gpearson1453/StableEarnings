CARA'S TIME went to the front, showed the way on the inside, responded well when asked outside the quarter-pole, drew off into the final furlong, remained
clear while shortening stride into the final sixteenth and held under steady urging. CALDWELL LUVS GOLD brushed with a rival at the start then was taken
in hand while crowded, was urged at the rear, went four then five wide on the turn, commenced a rally coming to the quarter-pole and finished with good
energy while unable to reach the winner. MY MANE SQUEEZE chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn and tired. MY SHEA D LADY
stalked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the three path on the turn, chases the winner into the stretch and weakened. NICKY JOLENE settled
just off the pace, dropped back with five furlongs to run, fell to the rear while three then two wide on the turn and faltered then was eased but walked off.

NOLITA bobbled at the start, showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch,
dug in under threat and gamely inched away at the end to prevail. NORTH END LADY broke out at the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside
through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out getting on near even
terms for command, dug in fighting on to the finish but was ultimately shaken off in the late going. FOXY CARA broke out at the start, chased six paths off
the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and weakened. SHE'S
A NATURAL broke out at the start bumping SAINTE CHAPELLE, chased four then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide
into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. SAINTE CHAPELLE got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe breaking outwards, raced five paths off
the inside in closest aim of the leader down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide in

well under a drive in the stretch and held under steady urging. APRIL ANTICS moved out while urged along early, raced just off the pace, chased five then
four wide on the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and was second best. TEMPERMENTAL brushed with a rival at the start, settled on the outside,
angled in late on the backstretch, moved from three to five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. OK HONEY was hustled

start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and cornered four then three wide into upper stretch, drew
off under a drive to prevail. SOLIB coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper

the outside prior to the start and weas reloaded, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch,
kicked on belatedly to the finish. CARBON broke through the gate prior to the start inspiring SIKUM to do so just after and MAJESTIC RETURN to knock
open her stall door before being reloaded, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and

EL GRANDE O bumped lightly with a rival at the start, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, moved clear at the
five-sixteenths pole, drew off into the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. AGGELOS THE GREAT moved out while urged along early then
chased the pace, went three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and safely secured the place. BONNE CHANCE was urged along on the
outside, went four to five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. SKYLER'S STARSHIP made light contact with a foe at the
start, was urged along off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went three then two wide on the turn and was no factor. DETECTIVE TOM
pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the four path on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths pole and came up empty. RANGER BLUE moved out
