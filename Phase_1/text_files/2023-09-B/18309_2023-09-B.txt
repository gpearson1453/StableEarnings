Footnotes
INEXORABLE was put to a bit of tight quarters early on, tracked along the inside, was roused to secure bidding position two wide and between horses
nearing the lane and drove clear in upper stretch. DUAL MONARCHY tracked in the four path, bid along with a pair of inner rivals entering the lane, but was
outkicked by one of them in the process, kept on while hanging on his left lead and secured place. CAPTIVATED DRAMA cleared off early on, but met an
trio of outer challenges nearing the lane and gave way on his left lead. SOUND DOCTRINE stalked the clear leader from the three path, was called upon for
run as rivals on both sides inched closer, ranged up along with them to attempt a bid nearing the lane, but weakened in upper stretch. JEWELSTOWN laid
off of the pace in the three to four path and ran on mildly to miss reaching fourth. STAR NATION broke a step slow, lagged well behind and showed
moderate late interest. JUDO lacked speed in the four to five path and faded.

Footnotes
KOUFAX set the pace along the inside, met a mild challenge from an outer rival nearing the lane, shook free of that one nearing midstretch and held sway.
CAN'T HUSH THIS bumped an inner rival at the start, prompted the pace two wide, backed off to stalk via snug restraint approaching the five furlong pole,
crept closer turning for home to attempt a bid nearing the quarter pole, but was turned away in upper stretch, kept on in pursuit thereafter, but was kept at
bay and proved second best. COOL RAGS took contact from an outer rival upon leaving the gates, trailed along the inside, gained in the two to three path
while splitting foes entering the lane and stayed on to secure show. MOHAAFETH was bumped between rivals at the start, chased along the inside under
busy handling and faded around the turn. ALFIO lacked speed in the four to three path and made little impact. MINE OWN STAR tracked three wide,
chased the top pair while tucking to the two path around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
SALT SPRAY (IRE) sparred outside of a rival while clinging to a margin around the turn, drove clear of that one leaving the furlong grounds and held from
an outer on-charging rival late. PINFIRE tracked three wide, between horses into the turn, rallied while closing in on the newly clear leader in the final
furlong, but needed more late to reel him in. CIGARETTE BOAT dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but yielded inside the furlong grounds and
lasted for show. TASTERFOR THE KING laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out approaching midstretch and rallied to miss reaching show. LEVEE
WAS DRY took light contact from an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack four wide into the turn, tucked behind inner foes turning for home, then
stayed on mildly between horses. COMMAND' ORO tracked from midpack along the inside, chased entering the lane, brushed with an outer rival at the
three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. CUORE SACRO prompted the pace two wide and between horses for a furlong, but failed to keep pace with those
rivals approaching the half mile pole, chased in the two path under urging around the turn, brushed with an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole while
giving way and faltered between horses. HALMSTAD broke a beat slow, trailed around the turn, swung to the six path entering the lane and moved up.
AIRBORNE ELITE broke a step slow, lacked speed in the two path, spun into the lane in the four path and made little impact. AMERICAN RAIDER brushed
an outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the three to five path and got outrun.

Footnotes
BACKSIDE BUZZ set the pace along the inside, inched away in hand with five sixteenths to go, drew off under light urging while hanging on his left lead and
felt a right handed crop at the sixteenth pole to seal the deal. GOLD LUCK took moderate contact from an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the
three path, then between horses into the turn, tipped to the four path at the five sixteenths pole while inching closer, bid for place entering the lane, gained
that position in upper stretch after the leader kicked away and ran on. KATTATH laid close up in the two path early on, chased the leaders approaching the
half mile pole, gave way while steadily losing position around the turn, yet sustained stride between horses in midstretch, bid for show while brushing an
inner rival at the sixteenth pole, and prevailed over an outer foe for that position. RIDER'S SPECIAL trailed in the three path, encountered traffic in the four
path in upper stretch, split rivals while jostling with an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole, stayed on mildly but was denied show late. CAPTAIN JACK
brushed an outer rival at the start, prompted the pace three to two wide and between horse, required urging to sustain pressure around the turn, but gave
way passing the five sixteenths pole, then took contact from an outer rival at the sixteenth pole before losing show and weakening. BOAT SONG lacked
speed in the four to five path, leaned inwardly while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch an bumped an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole before
tiring. BALSA stalked four to three wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader turning for home and weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
UMEBOSHI pressed two wide and between horses, sustained pressure spinning into the lane in the three path, fought on into midstretch, forged an
advantage at the sixteenth pole and held from an outer rival late. REMEMBERING tracked three wide, entered the lane in the four path while within striking
range, but subtly failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch, flopped back to his left lead under a right handed crop at the furlong grounds,
changed back to his right lead at the sixteenth pole, regained momentum in the late stages, closed in but needed more. MY FAVORITE GIRL took contact
from an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, pursued from the tow path around the far turn, took aim between horses in upper stretch, but lacked
the needed kick to secure leader-splitting position entering midstretch, was taken in hand among foes at the furlong grounds, altered course outwardly soon
after but lacked a bid. SHE'S ARODEOQUEEN broke inwardly and brushed an inner rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, held sway through
upper stretch, but was headed at the sixteenth pole and yielded. TAKETHESILVER was off slow while leaning inwardly at the start, saved ground off of the
pace and chased along the fence while gradually closing in. IUKA MISS laid off of the pace four wide, lacked a response to urging around the far turn and
tired. MOTEL MISCHIEF pursued from midpack two wide, was urged along in the three path around the far turn and faded. COLLIER raced at the rear
along the inside and never got involved. SESSA SISU lacked speed three wide, retreated towards the rear entering the backstretch and was outrun
thereafter.

Footnotes
FIBBER broke slowly, trailed along the inside, gained position inside of rivals turning for home to be within striking range two wide and behind the new
leader entering the lane, awaited racing room behind the top pair while moving to midstretch, found room and split those foes at the furlong grounds, surged
to the front leaving that station and held thereafter. SAM'S TREASURE broke a step slow, rushed forward in the early stages to be close up behind the
leaders by the half mile pole, stalked from the pocket around the turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, produced a bid in upper stretch, wrestled a narrow
advantage passing the three sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by an inner bidder at the furlong grounds, then fought on well thereafter. ZADORSKY
bumped lightly with an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the two path, crept closer in the three path around the turn, tipped four wide entering
the lane and chased willingly. TWIRLING QUEEN broke outwardly, stalked three wide, bid two wide at the five sixteenths pole, led entering the lane, clung
to a margin from an outer bidder while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, changed over before being headed passing the three sixteenths pole, then
gave way in the final furlong. RAINING SUGAR lacked speed two wide, spun into the lane in the four path and improved position. STREAMING NOW took
light contact from an inner rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, got headed by an outer bidder nearing the lane and weakened in upper stretch.
TOO FAST FOR YOU broke outwardly, raced off of the pace in the three to four path and faded in the five path entering the lane. DOT leaned out at the
start, prompted the pace two wide early on, but folded between horses with three furlongs to go.

Footnotes
RED RUN pursued from midpack in the two path, gained in the three path turning for home, tipped to the four path entering the lane, sustained progress to
bid along with an outer YAMATO coming to midstretch and edged clear in the final sixteenth. YAMATO bumped with an inner rival early on, laid unhurried
well back along the inside, gained in the four path around the far turn, spun for home in the five path, sustained a rally to bid along with an inner rival at the
furlong grounds, but failed to keep pace with that one in the late stages. ENGLISH TAVERN tracked along the inside, tipped off the rail entering the
backstretch, pursued two wide into the far turn, offered a bold three wide bid to blow past the leading pair at the five sixteenths pole, led before embracing
for a pair of outer challenges coming to midstretch, but was bested by those foes at the furlong grounds. COWBOY JUSTICE (GB) stalked along the inside,
checked while awaiting racing room just behind the leaders turning for home, remained blocked entering the lane, found a seam to split foes at the three
sixteenths pole and ran on. LAUGH A LOT bumped with an outer rival early on, laid off of the pace along the inside, paused behind traffic turning for home,
tipped three wide entering the lane, took aim inside of the leaders in upper stretch, but lacked a bid before yielding in the final furlong. TRAFALGAR lacked
speed along the inside, fanned to the six path entering the lane and moved up. THE REDS raced off of the pace two wide and between horses and failed to
factor. SAMYAZA was bumped among foes in the early stages and made little impact three wide. TEMPER TANTRUM stalked two tot three wide, but
weakened after getting floated four wide nearing the five sixteenths pole. STORM THE COURT set the pace along the inside moving through the lane for
the first time, stalked an outer clearing rival with six furlongs to go, re-engaged that one from the outside into the far turn, vied before being swiftly outkicked
by an outer rival at the five sixteenths pole and folded between horses in upper stretch. TATANKA cleared an inner rival around the first turn, showed the
way from that foe into the far turn, but proved no match for a wider bidder turning for home and stopped. WHAT A COUNTRY lagged well behind throughout
and showed little.

Footnotes
RUNGIUS settled well back in the two path, fanned to the six path entering the lane, rallied outside of foes in the final furlong and drove past the leader at
the sixteenth pole. MAHONEY ROAD dueled for the lead outside of a rival while in the three path, cleared that faltering foe at the three furlong pole,
maintained a clear margin through midstretch but was caught with a sixteenth to go. BOLT ABOVE bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked two wide
and between horses around the turn and chased evenly. BORN FLAWLESS tracked along the inside but lacked the needed kick to offer a bid. TROPIC
STORM laid off of the pace in the four to five path and ran on one paced. MIDWAY MIRACLE was void of early speed in the two path, shifted out to the
seven path in midstretch and moved up. LEND IT TEWMEY chased in the three path and gave way. GO VIRTUAL never got involved.
SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS chased three wide, entered the lane in the four path but weakened between horse while hanging on his left lead. MISTER
SHARPIE bumped with an inner rival at the start, dueled for the lead with an outer foe while in the two path, but weakened at the three furlong pole.
