HOP AND SCOTCH was well rated early on the inside, made a inside move on the turn to take over nearing the quarter pole, then drew off to prove much
the best, ridden out. GUILLAUME was reserved early, saved ground on the turn and finished well on the inside to be second best. KING OF DREAMS
chased the early pace in between rivals, then tracked the pace four wide while being bothered by CLAW down the backstretch, made a three wide bid on
the turn but weakened, bested rest. MISTER WINSTON was four wide into the first turn, set the pace while clear and off the inside, headed on the turn and
came four wide into the lane while giving way. KIDYOUNOT was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace on the outside and tired. CLAW tracked the
pace three wide and bothered and bumped a foe down the backstretch and then tired on the turn.

prove best, driving. FACE IT ALONE vied for the early lead outside a trio, then rated two wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane, lugged in by the
three sixteenths, then was corrected and finished willingly to be clearly second best. RITZ ON BROADWAY tracked the pace four wide, came five wide into
the lane and weakened, bested rest. NOSY chased the early pace three wide, dropped to the inside leaving the turn and improved position late to gain the
last spot in the superfecta. AMORICA was reserved on the inside, swung out wide leaving the turn and had no rally. HIPATIA was off a step slow, raced four
wide on the turn and was not a threat. BOBBI TWO STEPS vied for the early lead in between rivals, pressed three wide on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
PEACE FIRE checked on the first turn on the inside by the thirteen sixteenths, then moved out and made a five wide bid on the far turn, came seven wide
into the lane and hit the front by the furlong marker and edged clear to prove best, driving. SAVE YOUR TEARS was four wide into the first turn, then rated
along three to four wide, made a four wide bid on the turn to take over nearing the quarter pole, then came six wide into the lane and was headed by the
winner but was out-kicked by that rival while clearly second best. WINE IN THE DARK was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four wide, made a
three wide bid to gain a short lead on the far turn but weakened, bested rest. DUSTED chased the early pace on the inside, fell back on the turn, swung out
four wide leaving the turn and gained the last spot in the superfecta. MAGNOLIA ROAD passed the tiring rivals. DIVINE PROMISE pressed the pace three
wide, made a bid on the backstretch to gain a short lead but tired on the turn. HOT BOTTOM GIRL set a pressured pace on the inside and stopped.

THE SICARII was well rated between rivals, made a inside bid leaving the turn, then moved out to engage with the leader and had a long drive with that rival
and prevailed late to prove best, driving. DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY stalked the early pace on the outside five wide, made a four wide bid on the turn to duel
for command, then took over off the turn, then had a long drive with the winner and was out-kicked by that rival to just miss, good effort. WHAT'S TO
BLAME was reserved early, made a four wide move on the turn to move into contention but had no late kick while gaining the show award. CHRIS AND
DAVE stumbled after the start, vied for the lead three wide, made a bid entering the turn to gain a short lead, then dueled for command midway on the turn
and then faded in the drive, lost show award late. MIRACLE SILVER chased the pace on the inside and weakened. LIFESPAN was settled back four wide,
advanced five wide on the far turn but then came up empty in the drive. FEARLESS FLY was allowed to settle early and then failed to menace. ARTISTIC

Footnotes
LOGAN'S RUNNER was well rated along the inside, made a two wide bid on the turn, then drew off to prove much the best while being kept to crop urging.
SILENT MODE was allowed to settle three wide, then was four wide on the far turn while advancing, came five wide into the lane and proved to be no match
for the winner while second best. MORALES LITTLE KID was close up early two wide, then tracked the pace two wide on the backstretch, made a bid on
the turn but weakened. PRINCIPE was reserved early on the inside, shifted out three wide on the turn, then angled in leaving the turn and improved

was four wide into the first turn, tracked the pace four wide, made a mild bid three wide on the turn and tired in the drive. LT'S JACKNTHEBOX was settled
early and failed to respond. MAD DOCTOR was settled back early and failed to menace. KING JOEY was five wide into the first turn, then was keen and ran

Footnotes
GRAND MANNER prompted the early pace four to three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn, then dueled for the lead off the turn then slowly began to
edge clear late under a drive to prove best. SIMPSON BAY set a pressured pace two wide, then dueled with the winner off the turn and fought gamely to the
wire but was second best. MR. COWBOY BRADLEY was settled early, three wide on the turn and swung out four wide for the drive and finished willingly to
best the rest. ONEHANDSOMEDUDE pressed the pace on the inside, then drifted out in the lane and weakened. SILVER R was reserved early, four wide
on the turn and had no rally. TAPATERM broke in a tangle and was far back, not a factor. LUCKILY LEYTON stalked the pace five wide and stopped.
