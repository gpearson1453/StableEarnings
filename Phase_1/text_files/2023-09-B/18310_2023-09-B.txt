Footnotes
RANSEUR showed early speed on the rail, then tracked the leader, pressed the pace on the backside, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled, led into the
stretch, drew clear under urging and coasted the final yards. DANGEROUS MIND raced four wide early, settled off the pace, moved up four wide nearing
the far turn, rallied outside into the stretch, dug in and held for second. WHISKEY PRIZE stalked the pace in the early stages, chased three wide nearing the
far turn and rallied mildly inside in the stretch. RULE BREAKER raced three wide off the pace, chased on the far turn, came wide into the stretch and lacked
a rally. THE LAST JUMPSTART raced four wide early, settled off the pace, chased on the far turn and failed to threaten. PERSPICACIOUS BOY raced
three wide early, moved up on the clubhouse turn to set the pace, dueled inside on the far turn and faded in the final furlong. WIND EVENT raced off the
pace, was eased at the three eighths marker and walked off.
