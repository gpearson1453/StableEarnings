while coming on rapidly too late. MERRY OF SOUL inside run to the stretch, blocked in the final seventy yards while coming on too late. SIS BOOM BOB
speed to the front, blew the turn and bolted, rallied back in stride but came up empty in a courageous stretch effort from the rider. HOWIZEE chased pace to
turn, stayed on in the stretch, weakened late. GIN N SIN no speed to the turn, ran on in the stretch while closing the gap late. SOFIA STRONG close up
early, well off rail to the turn but weakened back. Race was hand timed due to a bad sensor on the turf course, all turf races will be hand timed for the
