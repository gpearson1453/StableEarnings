Footnotes
J M R TUREK was away alertly, a factor on the turn and with the lead from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. WHISPER ME A SONG
was unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. FAJARDO showed speed from the inside
and had the lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. BLASITO was in range, roused on the turn and from the four path at
the top of the stretch finished well. CATRIN was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no real threat.
LETS SAY THIS was off slow and saved ground on the turn but had no impact.

and trailed on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. THELONIOUS was in mid pack and moved up on the far turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. UNILATERAL was off the pace and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the four path at the top
of the stretch was no real threat. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) tracked the early leader but chased on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch
weakened. THE NEWFIE EXPRESS stalked the leaders from the outside but lost ground on the far turn and faded. CRYPTIC CREED had no speed and

Footnotes
EYE GOT IT GOOD was away alertly, forced the pace on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. TANGERINE TWIST was in
touch, a factor from the inside on the turn and had a bid in deep stretch but was outfinished. FOREST CHOICE showed speed from the outside and set the
pace, had the lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. UNABLE settled off the pace and raced evenly on the turn but
from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. WHATSWRONGWITHYOU was unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but from the three
path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. MISS SCHILLER was in mid pack and moved up on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch
leveled off. ONLY BELIEVE was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and was never in contention.

Footnotes
MERITAMEN was hustled early, a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. SECRET SUNSHINE settled
off the pace, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch rallied late. ZIPPITY DAY was in mid pack and had a mild gain from
between foes on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. HERMIONE GRANGER set the pace and had a clear lead on the
turn but was headed in deep stretch and weakened. MANITOULIN ISLAND was well back, closed the gap on the turn and passed tired foes through the
stretch. HONEYS DIAMOND was in range and roused from the inside on the turn but had no response. MISS MOLLY LALOU was off the pace and gained
ground on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no threat. TEQUILAS MELODY was in touch but chased on the turn and from the five
path at the top of the stretch faded. NORTHERN PASSAGE was unhurried early and showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
MAKES SENSE TO ME was in range, had a mild gain on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch drew off. MIZZ GEMMA was unhurried
early, gained ground on the far turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch was second best. FAVORITE CHANNEL was in touch, roused on the far
turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch finished well. SILENT WARNING was in mid pack and moved up on the far turn but from the five path at
the top of the stretch needed more. SMARTY ILLUSION was off the pace, raced evenly on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch
finished willingly. LOADED SECRET set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the far turn but gave way in mid stretch. ISA BREEZE forced the pace
and dueled on the far turn but weakened through the stretch. TURF AND SURF had no speed and was a factor on the far turn but from the three path at the
top of the stretch leveled off. HEAR ME KNOCKING settled off the pace and saved ground on the far turn but was not a factor. FLAT OUT ANGEL was well
back, showed nothing and was never in contention.

Footnotes
MISS LINDYSUE set the pace, had the lead on the turn and with mild pressure through the stretch was kept to task. PICK A PENNY was unhurried early,
had a mild gain on the turn and finished well. IMPOSSIBLE BERTIE was in touch, had a good position on the turn and from the four path at the top of the
stretch was the best of the rest. BELLE FEMME was off the pace, hustled along on the turn and was up for a share. LEMONSANDDIAMONDS was in mid
pack and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no response. SPEEDY NEPHRITE was in range and raced evenly on the turn
but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. BETKA was off slow, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the
stretch. ALWAY'S ROSIE had no speed, chased on the turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. SAGED ENERGY was away
alertly but in tight on the turn and had no rally. COSMIC SHOT was up close and a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was
empty.
