Footnotes
ANN ALEE was sent to the front to set the pace on the inside while clear, then remained clear to the wire while being kept to left handed crop to the
sixteenth pole and then was ridden out the final hundred yards to prove much the best. HONEY BELLA chased the winner two wide throughout, failed to
gain on that rival while being clearly second best. CHECKCASHINGCONNIE was rated along the inside, then was shuffled back and angled out by the
quarter pole, came five wide into the lane and was along for the show award. CALY BALI broke in a tangle at the start, then raced two wide and came four
wide into the lane and had no rally, out-kicked for the show award. MIDNIGHT LANE was settled early four to three wide and weakened. DELUSIONAL
DREAM was settled back and three wide on the backstretch and failed to respond.
