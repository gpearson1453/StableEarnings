Footnotes
TOO MANY KISSES stumbled after bumping with RUN AROUND SLEW then being pinched back soon after the break, hugged the inner rail the final half
mile, rallied inside ROYAL SEAMSTRESS and was up in time. ROYAL SEAMSTRESS drifted out leaving the starting gate, sped to the early lead, was well
off the rail in the stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth pole and was out finished. IRISH CRYSTAL , a forward factor along the inner rail on the turn, eased out
to the three path entering the stretch and flattened out. CUSHEE broke slowly, circled the field four wide on the turn and came up empty. PARTY IS OVER ,
a forward factor in the two path entering the turn, gave way leaving the turn. RUN AROUND SLEW bumped with the winner at the start, chased the pace
three wide around the turn, gave ay and was eased late.

Footnotes
POUNDING MUSIC , patiently handled while saving ground off the pace, edged up behind rivals leaving the far turn, angled out and circled four to five wide
into the lane, forged clear in mid stretch then widened a bit while kept to a steady drive. MARY JANE CHROME , taken to rate while saving ground,
advanced into the far turn, slipped through along the rail into the lane, eased out to continue progress past the three sixteenths, briefly loomed, kept on
willingly but was no match for the winner. WATER WITCH rated off the pace while saving some ground, raced in the clear heading to the far turn, eased out
with run past the quarter pole, lacked room nearing mid stretch, regrouped to split foes past the sixteenth marker and churned on. MISSAWLET settled off
the rail, gained three wide and between runners nearing the stretch but failed to sustain through the final furlong. PLEASE MARRY ME cleared early, set a
rated pace towards the rail, came under a ride soon into the lane, could not resist the winner leaving the three sixteenths and weakened. KIT CAN RUN
stumbled at the break, regrouped and settled well back while saving ground, worked well out in the course for the final furlong and rallied. HOT CHOICE , off
the pace, saved ground into the stretch, shifted out and had belated action. HEARTBURN prompted the pace outside the leader, failed to kick on from
between rivals in upper stretch and weakened. MISQUILLO was outrun.

Footnotes
BOB MARCO rushed up outside horses to take the lead entering the first turn, opened a long lead mid way down the backstretch, was kept near the inner
rail and responded to urging in the drive. SHADY MUNNI stalked the pace racing along the inner rail, failed to menace the winner and was best of the
others. DOLICE VITA , along the inner rail most of the trip, failed to rally in an even effort. SILENT MALICE trailed behind horses down the backstretch,
swung to the four path turning for home, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. PASSAGE OF LINES , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting
gate, raced wide down the backstretch and on the far turn while outrun. MIDNIGHT ACT bore in on horses leaving the starting gate, raced three wide the
first turn and failed to be a factor. PLOT THE DOTS , in tight quarters at the start, raced inside horses and gave way.

Footnotes
BESSIE BLUE settled inside in mid pack, eased off the rail and edged up while patiently handled past the five sixteenths, worked between runners into the
lane while put to asking, altered out widest to get a clear run past mid stretch, closed under right handed encouragement, switched over to her left lead
when taking command in deep stretch then dug in to fend off and inside surge from APPLE SHAKE SHAKE. APPLE SHAKE SHAKE broke a bit outward
and was off a beat slow, was unhurried early and raced three to four wide heading to the far turn, moved up behind rivals and waited briefly in upper stretch,
gained between runners past mid stretch, shifted in to split horses in deep stretch, finished gamely but had her rally fall just short. IMAGINETHEODDS
stalked inside, took closer order under rating past the five sixteenths, eased out then soundly bumped with VIROLOGIST when challenging between runners
in upper stretch, battled inside foes leaving the eighth pole but flattened out late. NAMI settled off the pace and off the inside, ranged up four wide into the
stretch, dueled on a slim lead past mid stretch, fought on past the sixteenth marker and faded late. MARLEY'S GHOST drafted well back early ln, came
under pressure leaving the far turn, swung well wide and had belated action. CATCH THE KITTEN , three to four wide, moved up to be a factor entering the
stretch but failed to sustain. QUEEN ROCKET tracked the pace outside a rival, moved up and engaged the leader from her outside with a quarter to go, led
in upper stretch, dueled between runners past mid stretch then gave way. TIME GOES FAST , three wide early, failed to menace. HAPPYINITIATIVE rated
between foes early, failed to menace. VIROLOGIST cleared early, set the pace towards the rail, opened up after a half, could not fend off a challenge
nearing the lane, was jostled soon after and faltered.

Footnotes
BELLA BETTINA , snugly rated down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch, had room inside LITTLE
JOSIE WALES and took the lead approaching the finish. NORTHERN GLOW , well outside foes down the backstretch, drifted in tightening quarters on a
pair of rivals approaching the half mile pole, circled the turn stalking the pace, was well positioned in upper stretch, challenged for the lead in mid stretch and
hung. LITTLE JOSIE WALES sprinted clear mid way down the backstretch, set the pace, was off the rail in the stretch and weakened the final sixteenth of a
mile. DEEDS OF LOVE bumped with HOT LOOKIN ROYAL at the start, was well placed along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the five path entering the
stretch and lacked the necessary rally. SUMMER ODDS bumped HOT LOOKIN ROYAL when bearing out at the break, saved ground on the turn, eased out
entering the stretch and gave way. HOT LOOKIN ROYAL bumped DEEDS OF LOVE when forced out and placed in tight quarters by SUMMER ODDS
leaving the starting gate, trailed to the stretch then showed some late interest. NINETEENAMENDMENT chased the pace in two path to the stretch and
gave way. LIQUIDATOR , caught in tight quarters when PEACE OUT was forced in by NORTHERN GLOW approaching the half mile pole, was fanned six
deep turning for home, gave way and eased up late. PEACE OUT , placed in tight quarters by NORTHERN GLOW approaching the half mile pole, gave way

Footnotes
BROCKNARDINI rated two wide while not far back, dropped in around the far turn then edged up closer inside rivals past the five sixteenths, was
maneuvered outward leaving the three sixteenths, forged to command outside runners past mid stretch, eagerly cleared and was steadily hand ridden to the
wire. FLOWERS FOR ME stalked three wide outside the leader, came under pressure past the five sixteenths, challenged between runners leaving the
three sixteenths, drifted in near the sixteenth marker but dug in gamely to preserve the place. YATTA bobbled at the break, recovered and rated off the
inside, gained between rivals leaving the five sixteenths, angled five wide for the drive, moved up past the furlong grounds, churned on but was out kicked
for the place. POSITIVE CARRY (IRE) broke a step slow then settled off the pace, raced between rivals past the half, gained in hand towards the rail
nearing the quarter pole, eased out into the stretch then moved between runners, dropped back down towards the rail and threatened past mid stretch,
steadied when in a bit close near the sixteenth marker, came back out and continued with some interest. LOW MILEAGE saved ground off the pace, angled
out leaving the far turn, moved up between rivals in upper stretch, angled in a bit past mid stretch and kept on. DETERMINED SAIL stalked outside a rival,
gained four wide under a ride into the lane, failed to sustain past mid stretch and faded. CARMELINA grabbed command early, set the pace off the rail, was
under pressure maintaining command past the three sixteenths, was hooked from both sides soon after and gave way. KISSEDBYANANGEL rated off of a
rival soon after the break, lost ground four wide into the far turn, remained four wide into the lane but lacked a bid. GORGEOUS GIRL saved ground and
faded. HEKATE saved ground while very tough to settle when fighting restraint through about the opening three and a half furlongs, settled better near the
far turn, gained towards the rail past the five sixteenths, chased the leaders into the lane, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and weakened.

Footnotes
SIR ALFRED JAMES showed speed three deep down the backstretch and on the turn, gained a short lead turning for home, battled inside CLASSIER the
final three sixteenths of a mile and determinedly prevailed. CLASSIER hugged the rail entering the turn, remained inside horses on the turn, swung four
wide entering the stretch, challenged for the lead in upper stretch and battled gamely. NO CENTS set a pressured pace along the inner rail, failed to match
strides with the two pair in the drive, faded and was best of the others. EASTERN BAY , taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, remained
along the rail there after and lacked the needed late response. BUSINESS MODEL lacked speed, swung to the five path leaving the turn and passed tired
horses. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened through the stretch. WENDELL FONG , along the inner rail
stalking the pace to the stretch, gave way. AIN'T DA BEER COLD stumbled at the start, raced four deep on the turn and was never a factor. MR PHIL
bobbled slightly at the break, prompted the pace between horses to the turn then faltered.

Footnotes
YAMATO , taken to rate off the pace while saving ground, angled out near the five eighths and quickly gained three wide, checked when in tight near the
half, regrouped then advanced to the inside of BEAR OAK mid way on the final turn, came out and bid three wide to engage the dueling leaders
approaching the stretch, wrested command near the three sixteenths, kicked clear under a drive with a furlong to go, edged away a bit and held firm while
kept alert. EONS moved up four wide into the first turn to gain a tracking spot, went after the leader two wide leaving the half, dueled from the far turn,
gained a short advantage past the five sixteenths, dug in when collared by winner entering the stretch, could not quite go with that one heading to the
furlong grounds but dug in gamely and held down the place. BEAR OAK , in hand early while saving ground, eased outside for the run through the stretch
the first time, rushed up four wide after given his cue leaving the five eighths then briefly threatened near the half, gave hard chase of the embattled leaders
leaving the five sixteenths and into the lane then continued on with effort to the wire. WILL E SUTTON saved ground with pursuit, was under pressure into
the stretch but came up empty. SERIFOS was rated back from between foes in the opening furlong, saved ground while unhurried, came off the rail then
three wide for the drive but lacked a rally. REGAL KINGDOM , off the pace while saving ground, eased out near the three eighths but lacked a serious
punch. IT CAN BE DONE was nudged clear early, dropped in and set the pace, was joined from his outside by EONS with a half mile remaining, sparred
with that one from the far turn, stayed on to the inside of the leading pair to upper stretch then weakened through the final furlong. OCEANS MAP rated
outside a rival early then failed to generate a run. THE HAPPY GIANT , inside off the pace, was outrun. TIZ A GIANT , three wide, gave way.

Footnotes
INTERSTATEDAYDREAM broke awkwardly, was five deep entering the first turn, worked between horses while in the three path on the far turn, swung four
wide entering the stretch, swept to command near the sixteenth pole and drew ouf. MISS NEW YORK stumbled leaving the starting gate, chased pace,
raced in the two path around the far turn and finished gamely. MALIBU BEAUTY , right to the early lead, set an unpressured pace along the inner rail, was
well clear in mid stretch then gave way. HYBRID ECLIPSE lacked speed, circled foes on the far turn, was five deep approaching the stretch and failed to
rally. SIX THE HARD WAY raced in mid pack down the backstretch, hugged the inner rail entering the stretch and weakened. BATUCADA , three wide both
turns, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO , in the two path chasing the pace to the far turn, faltered. BATTLE BLING ,
hard used four wide the opening furlong, remained outside horses down the backstretch and gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
AIR RECRUIT , reluctant to load, came away in good order to be forward, dropped in to secure the rail into the first turn, rated kindly through the backstretch
run, took closer order into the far turn, sat patiently before angling three wide past the five sixteenths, bid three deep in hand entering the lane, took over
from WINE COLLECTOR leaving the three sixteenths, kicked clear past the furlong grounds then eagerly widened under a drive. MASSIF settled well off the
pace, angled six wide gathering momentum into the lane, moved up between runners soon after, steadied and bumped when in tight leaving mid stretch,
bumped with MORTAL SIN near the sixteenth pole, regrouped and kept on gamely to nab the place. BLUE CREEK lagged far back, angled seven wide
while advancing to the outside of MASSIF, drifted in tightening that one in mid stretch, corrected and continued on willingly while just missing the bob for
second. WINE COLLECTOR stalked the pace, moved closer under a ride and took on the leader past the five sixteenths, sparred into the lane, kept on
gamely to mid stretch then weakened late. MORTAL SIN rated between rivals early on, advanced to the inside of a foe past the five sixteenths, eased out,
worked between runners leaving the five sixteenths, exchanged a couple of bumped nearing the sixteenth marker then flattened out. UNDERSTUDY KITTY
settled off the pace, angled four wide making some progress nearing the lane but failed to seriously kick on. SASSE'S CLASS saved ground in mid pack,
gained along the rail and under a ride entering the stretch, chased inside foes leaving mid stretch then faded. SKELLIG ISLAND saved ground off the early
pace, was under a ride leaving the far turn, stayed inside into the lane but came up empty. GRAND KINGDOM eased back from between runners nearing
the first turn, dropped in then lacked a rally. DANCING MISCHIEF , three wide stalking the pace, moved up between runners near the half, could not keep
pace while under asking past the five sixteenths and tired. TROPANDHAGEN cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, moved away mid way through
the backstretch run, was engaged past the five sixteenths, battled to upper stretch then faltered through the final furlong. ELEVATED GAME broke
sluggishly, was used four wide to reach a forward spot into the far turn, chased outside rivals into the far turn then faltered.

Footnotes
ENERGY EFFICIENT stalked the pace outside horses, advanced four deep leaving the turn, took command turning for home and drew away. MONEY
ROOM , in the two path behind horses on the turn, moved to the four path at the head of the stretch and rallied. MARGIE'S FUN SON , steadied in traffic
about a furlong after the break, saved ground on the turn, advanced along the inner rail to mid stretch and flattened out. INFINITE SERIES , rank leaving the
backstretch, was fanned six deep leaving the turn and rallied. BY HAND , under urging early, gained the lead along the inner rail entering the turn, lost the
advantage in upper stretch and gave way. CATCHING STARS , unhurried down the backstretch, raced along the inner rail and lacked room through most of
the stretch. LORD OF MISCHIEF prompted the pace in the two path between horses and weakened. MIDNIGHT MINE stumbled leaving the starting gate,
was fanned seven wide turning for home and failed to be a factor. JOHN JAY showed speed three wide, drifted to the five path turning for home, faltered
and was eased.
