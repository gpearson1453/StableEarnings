Footnotes
IT AINT OVER raced close to the early pace, took back and tracked outside of rivals into the turn, came three wide to the quarter marker and was asked for
run four wide into the stretch, offered a strong rally inside of the furlong marker, reeled in the leading pair inside of the sixteenth-pole and drew clear in the
final stages. UNCLE LEON vied for the early lead, took back and stalked the decent early pace while two wide, improved position while three wide
approaching the quarter marker, chased REGAL REDWOOD to mid-stretch while running on the left lead, was not able to keep pace with the winner in deep
stretch and outfinished REGAL REDWOOD for second in the final strides. REGAL REDWOOD vied for the early lead with UNCLE LEON, had a brief lead in
the opening furlong then ceded the lead to RAMATHORN and stalked that rival into the turn, saved ground along the bend, tipped two wide nearing the top
of the lane, took command in upper stretch and was set down at the furlong marker, held foes at bay to the sixteenth-pole, could not match strides with IT
AINT OVER in deep stretch and was outfinished in the final yards for second, while clear of the rest for third. RIGHT HAND RYDER was away in good
order, rated off of the early pace and tracked outside of rivals into the turn, chased three wide to the quarter marker, came four wide into the stretch,
improved position at the furlong marker and was able to offer a mild late bid in the final stages. RANDY'SFURRYFRIEND settled off of the decent early
pace, chased along the turn while two wide and between rivals, swung three wide for the stretch drive and did not threaten. RAMATHORN broke out at the
start, made contact with a neighboring rival then stumbled sharply and was off a bit slowly, was guided outside of runners and rushed up to assume
command heading to the half-mile marker, set decent fractions along the turn and extended the lead heading to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper
stretch and tired in the final furlong. SIX HOT GRANDS tracked the decent early pace from the inside, lost position along the turn, saved ground to the top of
the stretch and did not factor in the drive. PER THE HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, REGAL REDWOOD HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A
POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
STORMIN GALILEO broke alertly then prompted the pace just behind HAY JUAN, moved to engage that one at the top of the stretch, had some trouble
getting past that stubborn opponent, gained the upper hand inside the sixteenth and prevailed. HAY JUAN broke well and took command of the pace before
the half mile pole, let the field through the turn, repelled an initial challenge from STORMIN GALLILEO near the quarter pole then battled that one gamely
down the stretch only to be outfinished near the wire. AMANOFMYSTATURE broke well, contested the early pace from the inside, then was unable to keep
pace with the leading duo though the turn, kept on to the wire and finished well enough to hold third. SONOFAFINCH broke sharply then veered outward,
allowed the field to pass then moved to the rail, losing some ground to the leaders in the process, chased the field through the turn, drifted out a bit on the
final bend, kept to task and improved position somewhat but was never a threat to the top two. GALOPIN GOURMET was up on the pace through the initial
stages, then backed off near the half mile marker, made a run through the turn, came into the stretch three wide, ran on but was outfinished in the end.

Footnotes
BREVE was off a step slowly at the break and settled off of the fast early pace, improved position on the turn while two wide and gained ground into the
stretch, angled out inside of the furlong marker, continued her sustained rally into deep stretch, caught MAGIC WANDERER in the final strides and was up
in time to prevail in a good debut. MAGIC WANDERER tracked the solid early pace from the inside, gave chase along the turn and swung three wide
approaching the top of the stretch, vied for the lead in upper stretch then took command approaching the furlong pole, drew to a clear lead at the
sixteenth-marker, was caught in deep stretch by the winner and was well clear of the rest for second. SING A HAPPY SONG tracked the solid early pace
while two wide, inched closer to the loose pacesetter along the turn, vied for the lead into upper stretch, battled with MAGIC WANDERER to the furlong
grounds, could not keep pace with the top two into deep stretch and held clearly for third at the finish. TIFF WITH JIMMY chased the solid pace from the
inside, saved ground to the top of the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and could not muster a response in deep stretch. MEADOWOOD was sent
after the start and dictated terms early on, showed good early speed and drew to a clear lead heading into the turn, set the pace from the inside heading to
the quarter marker, came under pressure in upper stretch, was overtaken nearing the furlong pole and weakened in the final stages. FLY SOUTH chased
the solid early pace while outside of rivals, lost position on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and tired. SWEET LAKER lacked early speed, trailed
into the turn and did not have an impact.

Footnotes
WILD BILLY D took back off of the contentious early pace and tracked the dueling leaders into the turn, came two wide into bend and chased the solid pace
to the quarter marker, responded to firm urging into upper stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, came in a bit tight in the final sixteenth when
ELCONDOR drifted out a path, split rivals in deep stretch and surged in the final yards to prevail. ELCONDOR was sent leaving the break and disputed the
solid early pace with GOLDENSPA, shook free from that rival entering the turn, drew to a clear lead and carved out quick fractions heading to the quarter
marker, showed the way into upper stretch while in hand, came under pressure nearing the sixteenth-marker and drifted out a bit at that station while put to
right-handed urging, grudgingly gave way to the winner in deep stretch and just held for second at the wire. PINEAPPLE JUICE hit the gate then was
bumped by a neighboring rival at the start and was off a bit slowly, recovered to track the solid early pace from a two wide path, gained ground along the
turn, continued that bid into upper stretch. BIG BENO was unhurried in the early running and trailed into the turn, was roused leaving the three-furlong
marker and came four wide into upper stretch, made a mild gain at the furlong marker, found his best stride late but was unable to impact the top three at
the finish. GOLDENSPA was hustled to be prominent in the early going, contested the solid early pace with ELCONDOR while inside of that rival, lost
ground into the turn and chased from the inside heading to the quarter marker, ran in pursuit to mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. COUNT ASHER was
asked for speed leaving the start and was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the solid pace from a three wide path into the turn, chased the loose
pacesetter to the quarter marker, raced three wide into the lane, could not keep pace heading to the furlong grounds and weakened in the final stages.
DRAW SOME broke alertly, took back to track the solid early pace from the second flight, lost position on the turn while four wide, slipped to the two path
heading to the quarter marker and did not threaten in the stretch drive. GULARA chased the solid early pace, ran in pursuit while four wide heading to the
quarter marker, dropped back approaching the top of the stretch and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
QUALITY CAT a little slow into stride then roused by the rider for some speed, then allowed to settle near the back of the pack racing on the outside of a trio
that were unhurried through the early stages, remained in the clear to the outside down the backstretch, began to rally still wide through the far turn, came
into the stretch in the four path then produced a strong rally win clear. HOT JOURNEY settled in the third spot tracking just behind BLUE SILVER and
OVERRRULE to the far turn, followed the latter through the that foe moved for the lead, tipped three wide into the stretch, hooked up in a stretch duel,
gained the upper hand in the final furlong but could not hold off the winner. TABLE FOR TWO was a little slow into stride then steadied behind horses, got
over the the rail and into a good tracking position, was content to race there to the half, then moved up to contend for the lead, became boxed in through the
turn, got clear at the top of the stretch and was running on well then had to check briefly in deep stretch then surged again to just miss second. OVERRULE
broke well then was prompted to gain forward position, settled just behind BLUE SILVER and stalked that one to the far turn, bid for the lead near the
quarter pole, took command before the turn for home then was challenged to the outside by HOT JOURNEY, hung on to deep stretch then weakened in the
late stages. GEORGE HERMAN RUTH raced between horses near the back of the pack through the first half mile, began to make some forward progress
after passing the half mile marker, rallied through the second turn, continued to run on through the stretch but came up short of a minor award. YOU
KIDDING ME devoid of early speed, was content to settle at the back of the strung out field, began to rally with three furlongs to run but was blocked
through the turn, swung out into the clear four wide for the stretch run, made a mild rally and was gaining some ground but much too late. LORD OF LIGHT
settled mid-pack and held that position to the far turn, had trouble changing leads in the stretch, came in tight nearing the furlong grounds and checked,
finished evenly in the final stages and could not improve position. WRONG SPOT saved ground throughout, raced near the back of the field on the inside of
three horses across the track, fell back to last through the far turn, never uncorked a rally and passed a tired one late. BLUE SILVER was encouraged from
the break towards the lead, gained the rail and a short lead going into the clubhouse turn, set reasonable fractions to the far turn while being pressed by
OVERRULE to the outside, gave way readily when that one challenged passing the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
DANCE COMPANY was forwardly placed into the first turn, settled just off of the decent pace and tracked three wide early on, was well placed through the
backstretch run and gained ground heading to the half-mile marker, improved position at the quarter pole and was roused three wide approaching the top of
the lane, chased MUCHO MACHISMO to the furlong grounds, steadily advanced on that rival into deep stretch, caught MUCHO MACHISMO in the final
yards and was up in time to prevail. MUCHO MACHISMO was sent leaving an alert beginning and dictated terms into the first turn, set decent fractions
while well handled through the backstretch run, showed the way to the quarter marker then drew to a clear lead into upper stretch and widened the lead at
the furlong grounds, was kept to task to the sixteenth-marker, was all out to hold off DANCE COMPANY in the final strides and was tagged for the win at the
finish, while besting the rest. COOPERKLIMT bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried in the early going and was content to trail through
the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn, waited for racing room at the quarter marker, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, closed willingly in deep
stretch and was up in the final strides to secure third. ALGERIA (IRE) showed early speed and was forwardly placed while outside of runners heading into
the first turn, stalked the decent pace from a two wide path into the backstretch run, attended to the pace to the far turn, could not keep pace with MUCHO
MACHISMO into the stretch, weakened in the final furlong and was outfinished for third in the final strides. DARK MYSTERY was asked for speed leaving
the start and was prominent into the first turn, rated off of the decent early pace and tracked from the second flight into the backstretch run, was well
positioned heading to the half-mile marker, lost ground while two then three wide along the far turn, chased into the stretch, was able to make a mild late
rally in deep stretch but could not impact the leaders. TAKE THE TWO TEN was allowed to settle in the early running and saved ground into the first turn,
maintained his position through the backstretch run, was coaxed along four wide into the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, Herrera lost his crop at
the furlong marker, was able to make a mild late bid and improved position in the final sixteenth. DANZ TILL TEN was forwardly placed leaving the break,
was a bit keen in the early running and checked off of heels entering the first turn, settled along the rail and tracked the decent fractions into the backstretch
run, was coaxed along three wide into the far turn, raced four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten in the late stages. APLOMBADO was away in good
order, was prominent into the first turn and tracked the decent early pace from the inside, saved ground through the backstretch run, lost position heading to
the quarter marker, was outrun into upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. DADDY'SDARLINGBOY tracked the early pace while outside of rivals,
raced four wide into the backstretch run and came widest to the half-mile marker, was steered three wide into the far turn, chased from a two wide path
heading to the quarter marker, dropped back into upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
AUSPICIOUS STYLE was forwardly placed leaving the start and stalked the solid early pace while three wide along the first turn, was well placed along the
backstretch run then mounted a two wide bid along the far turn, drew to even terms with ROBIE into upper stretch, dueled to the outside of that rival to the
furlong grounds, continued to gamely battle with ROBIE into the final sixteenth, determinedly took a slim lead in deep stretch and held well in the final strides
to prevail for a game win. ROBIE was away in good order and was prominent leaving the start, prompted the solid early pace from a two wide path along the
first turn, kept close attendance to STONE'S RIVER to the half-mile marker then assumed command entering the far turn, vied for the lead with
AUSPICIOUS STYLE heading to the quarter marker and dueled with that rival into the stretch, battled to the furlong marker while inside of AUSPICIOUS
STYLE, continued to gamely duel with AUSPICIOUS STYLE into deep stretch and was bested in the final strides in a great effort, while holding for second
at the finish. TABLE FOR TEN settled off of the solid early pace, raced outside of rivals along the first turn and came widest into the backstretch run, gained
ground heading to the half-mile marker, mounted a three wide bid along the far turn and came within aim nearing the quarter pole, ran evenly to mid-stretch,
responded to steady urging in the drive, closed willingly in the final stages, could not reel in the top two at the finish and held well for third. ONE FAST BRO
was unhurried in the early running, was coaxed along three wide into the far turn and improved position heading to the quarter marker, came four wide into
the stretch and advanced at the furlong marker, found his best stride late and just missed for third. CAISSON was allowed to settle, raced three wide into the
backstretch run and gained ground at the half-mile marker, continued that advance while four wide along the far turn, ran evenly to the furlong pole, lacked
the needed response in deep stretch and flattened out in the final sixteenth. HEAT N REHEAT settled off of the solid early pace, maintained a two wide path
to the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and offered a mild late rally. SUPERMAZEL tracked the early pace from the second flight, maintained a two
wide path to the far turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. BIRTH OF COOL tracked the solid early pace from the
inside, saved ground through the backstretch run while well placed, maintained a rail trip to the top of the stretch, lost position approaching the furlong pole
and tired in deep stretch. SILENT SUNDAY drifted out at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled in the three path in the early stages, lost position on the
far turn while four wide and did not threaten in the stretch. STONE'S RIVER stumbled at the start, rushed up and assumed command leaving the chute, set
a solid early pace from the inside, set a pressured pace along the backstretch run, lost the lead and dropped back heading to the far turn, was pulled up
nearing the top of the stretch and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
TOUCH OF ZEN was off slowly and fell far behind the runaway pace setter, began a sustained rally from the half mile pole, flew past the tiring ATTA BOY
LLOYD near the furlong marker and drew off to an easy win. ATTA BOY LLOYD broke well and sped off to a big early lead, opened up on the turn, repelled
a bid by AS LUCK HAPPENS near the quarter pole, began to tire noticeably near the eighth pole but was able to hold second. CARDINAL TRICK raced in
the middle of the strung out field, made a mild rally, kept to task and just got up for the third spot. AS LUCK HAPPENS broke well but was outrun for the
lead, chased ATTA BOY LLOYD as that one opened up on the field, began to cut into the margin passing the three furlong pole, got to the flank of that rival
on the turn for home but could not continue the run and faded. RAYS REGAL broke well but was outrun early, moved over the rail when clear, was done
before the stretch and was never a threat.
