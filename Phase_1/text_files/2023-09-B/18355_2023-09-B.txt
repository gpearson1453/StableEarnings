Footnotes
MO'S MOJO sat just off the second flight heading into the turn, moved up closer three wide near the quarter pole, took over the lead approaching the furlong
marker and finished going away while ridden out. SAY IT NICELY was forwardly placed into the turn, launched a two wide bid for the leader at the quarter
pole, ran on two to three wide into the lane, was no match for pulling away winner but stayed on gamely to capture place. CHICAGO CHROME raced inside
in early contention, waited on the rail around the turn, cut the corner entering the head of the lane, given cue upper stretch, stayed on with response and just
missed place. NORTH SIDE sped to the lead soon after the start and led the way by a slim margin around the turn, got collared by the winner near the
eighth pole, stayed on briefly then gave way. LIVINGONTULSATIME was not too far back in early stages, drifted out five paths wide into upper stretch and
steadily faded.

Footnotes
WAR RON vied for the lead in the opening quarter then held a clear lead still unasked around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, responded willingly
when called upon and finished going away. ALLEN'S ROCKET rated off the pressured top flight in the opening quarter, let out a notch and circled up closer
three wide late on the turn, sustained a three wide bid into stretch run, was no match for pulling away winner but sustained a solid bid for second best.
OSCAR WINNER WALLY vied for the lead in the opening quarter then remained forwardly placed, hustled along two to three wide around the turn, kept on
through the lane and cleared a share. THAT'S WHAT I SAY was unhurried and raced in the last flight, picked up the tempo late on the turn, swung five wide
into upper stretch and improved position. GINGER RULES saved ground while racing in the last flight, angled out and came under a ride three wide turning
for home and failed to kick on. COBYMEISTER vied for the lead in the opening quarter, chased along the rail around the turn then tired in the drive. JUST
JOHNNY chased the top trio up the backstretch, ran on three to four wide around the turn then faded.

AIR JOCK hustled up to the lead heading into the first turn, led the way then came under some pressure from PANZER PRIDE mid-way up the backstretch,
repelled bids late on the far turn, saved ground entering the lane, widened to a clear lead a furlong out then held late under driving finish. GO FOR IT settled
nicely and rated off the top trio up the backstretch, waited briefly on the rail around the turn then came under a ride turning for home, tipped two wide for the
drive and sustained a determined bid to the wire. PANZER PRIDE was forwardly placed around the first turn and applied pace pressure to AIR JOCK up the
backstretch, was ridden along two wide in striking distance but could not reach the leader around the far turn, weakened off the top pair in the lane and just
lasted for show. ITWASTHISBIG stalked three wide up the backstretch, chased three wide up close around the far turn, weakened off the top pair in the lane
and got outnodded for show. DARYL'S BOLT trailed around the first turn then pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT RULES led the way heading into the first turn then came under pressure from LEADING THE CAUSE, set a pressured pace up the backstretch
then dueled inside of rival around the far turn, cut the corner turning for home and shook free to a slim lead, gathered momentum under a drive and kicked
clear. LEADING THE CAUSE applied pace pressure to MIDNIGHT RULES leaving the first turn and continued up the backstretch, dueled for command
around the far turn, failed to match strides with the eventual winner into the lane but stayed on with response and held place. ON A DARE raced in
contention along the inside around the first turn, tracked the embattled pair up the backstretch, hustled up late on the far turn and sustained a two to three
wide bid through the lane. EYE OF THE PANTHOR saved ground around the first turn, was unhurried and raced in the back then retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
FRANKLYGREAT vied in opening stages then took over the lead and led the way into the turn, turned back bids near the quarter pole, came two wide into
upper stretch, roused for more, responded willingly and finished going away while ridden out. PAPA GEEB was unhurried, saved ground around the turn,
shifted out wide in upper stretch and got up late for pace. QUARTERNIGHT was ridden along the outside near mid-way around the turn, swung five wide
into the lane, finished with response and just missed place. DEER RUN raced near mid-pack, saved ground around the turn, sustained an inside bid through
the lane and needed more for serious impact. BABYS TIME TO SING raced in early contention, chased two to three wide around the turn then flattened in
the lane. LAST SENTENCE was forwardly placed in opening stages, continued to chase up close around the turn, ran on past the eighth pole then gave
way. CYTOKINE STORM tracked the pace and waited briefly on the rail around the turn, hustled along two wide into upper stretch then faded in the final
furlong. MR. PRIME TIME chased up the inside while not too far back in opening stages then weakened, chased five wide into upper stretch and had no late
response. SPIRITED DREAM lacked speed and failed to move into contention.
