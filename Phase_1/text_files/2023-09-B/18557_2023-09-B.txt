AVE'S IN COMMAND away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch,
shook clear of his pace rival leaving the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive while holding off a late charge by WISE MARKET. WISE
MARKET away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched his bid two wide entering the final turn, and
closed willingly from along the rail in the drive while gaining ground late. CALAMAZEUS tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one
out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly two out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. VALUABLE COWBOY
broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of AVE'S IN COMMAND entering the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of that rival in the
run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival leaving the turn, and faded in the late going.
MORETHANSOULTITLE settled at the back of a compact field while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering
the final turn, steadied when put in tight quarters leaving the turn, and lost all momentum. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of
foul. The rider of MORETHANSOULTITLE lodged a claim of foul again the rider's of both CALAMAZEUS and WISE MARKET for alleged interference
entering the stretch. After review the claims of foul were disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish.

PETERSON LANDING away well and pressed the pace from the outside of MS. STANFORD entering the backstretch, took control entering the final turn,
and was never threatened late under confident handling. ANZAC BAY broke sharply and tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while
racing one out from the rail, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best.
ELLAMEISTER settled at the back of a compact field while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide entering the
final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to garner a share. MS. STANFORD away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn,
set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, was unable to match strides with her pace rival entering the final turn, and weakened over the final
furlong. PRINCESS HANNA tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, dropped back to trail entering the final turn, and had
little to offer over the final furlong.

VIVA LA DIVA broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of ACOUSTIC MELODY in

tracked the leader through the first turn while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and through the final turn,
struggled to match strides with her pace rival leaving the turn, and finished three wide to hold the place. BROOKE MAGIC away well and stalked the battling
leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished gamely
from along the inside in the drive without clear sailing. HORATIO stalked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the
rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact while finishing four wide in the drive. DAZ LIN FORCE was off a step slow, but
raced into a stalking trip two wide in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to mount a serious late bid when
called upon. NU SOUP FOR BABY unhurried early while trailing the field into the first turn, was always well back, and failed to make an impact.

TOBESUNNY broke sharply and dueled the lead through the stretch the first time from the outside of STAR FINALITY, continued to force the issue from the
outside of that rival in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive to prove best. STAR FINALITY
away alertly and raced to the lead in the run to the first turn while saving ground at the rail, battled through the turn from the inside of TOBESUNNY,
continued to set a pressured pace from the inside of that rival through the second turn and in the run down the backside, the battled between the pacesetter
continued through the final turn, held a narrow advantage into the lane, but was unable to fend off a stubborn TOBESUNNY in deep stretch, while proving
easily second best. SILVER ARROW settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, launched her bid smartly
two wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. ISLAND LIVING away well and tracked the dueling leaders
through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the
final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. PEACEHAVEN settled at the back of the pack while racing three wide entering the
stretch the first time, continued with a wide trip throughout, and was unable to mount a serious late bid, while only passing a tiring rival late. STRIKING
VALUE stalked the leaders into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained her position into the backstretch, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

SPACE away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of BRIAN's DE LEIGHT entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide
in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, got the better of his pace rival leaving the turn, and finished determinedly from along the rail and
held off a late surge by COUNTERACT to prevail. COUNTERACT stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time,
began to advance at the rail midway down the backstretch, saved ground while mounting his bid through the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane to
collar the leader, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to just miss. PURSUE was off a step slow, and trailed the field into the stretch the first time
while saving ground along the inside, continued to bide his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, launched his bid four wide entering
the final turn, but needed more late while finishing three wide in the drive to garner a share. BRIAN'S DE LEIGHT away alertly and vied for the lead from
along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, struggled to match strides
with his pace rival leaving the turn, steadied when in tight at the rail leaving the turn, and faded in the stretch drive. NEIGHBOR broke sharply and tracked
the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position into the backstretch, began to struggle to keep up in
the run to the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of BRIAN's DE
LEIGHT lodged a claim of foul against the rider of SPACE for alleged interference at the head of the lane. after review the claim of foul was disallowed, and

NEIGHNEIGH settled well off the early pacesetter while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide entering the final
turn, steadied while running up on heels midway through the turn, shifted three wide leaving the turn, and closed with a rush four wide in the drive to get up
in the closing strides. ADDENDUM settled off the early pace while saving ground entering the backstretch, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn,
and closed determinedly two wide in the drive while taking the narrowest of advantages in deep stretch, but was unable to fend off the late surge by
NEIGHNEIGH in the final strides. BELCARRA PARK rushed to a clear lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the
backstretch, maintained a clear advantage into the final turn, and just failed to last, while proving clearly best of the rest. QUALITY COMMAND away well
and was allowed to settle off the early leader while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, was pushed
four wide leaving the turn, and finished evenly in the drive. HOAX away alertly and stalked the pacesetter into the backstretch while saving ground at the
rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. KAPALUA CANDY broke sharply and stalked
the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position in the run to the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.
EBONY EYES was bumped solidly at the start, and trailed the field into the first turn, was always well back and never a factor. Following the running of this
race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of QUALITY COMMAND lodged a claim of foul against the rider of NEIGHNEIGH, for alleged interference
leaving the final turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish.
