and finished with good courage. DISTORTED LIMITS went evenly. DECEITFUL failed to menace. SAMMY'S SMILE was no threat. GOING IN STYLE was
hung five wide into the first turn, went up to press the pace two wide before a quarter, kept on into the stretch then faltered. ST. LUKES close up early, was

MON CAMO away alertly, set all the pace and widened through the stretch while drifting out to the middle of the racetrack to win as much the best.
VENETIAN DREAM pressured the winner three wide and gamely held on for second. MY TWO AUNT JOANS never far back, finished with good courage
outside rivals. LAZARUS PROJECT raced five wide down the backstretch and went evenly. MONTAUK COVE was fractious in the gate, stumbled at the
start, rushed to contention along the rail before a quarter, lacked room into the turn then faded in the stretch. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER was no factor. STAY
THIRSTY AMIGO had speed through the turn then weakened. EXALTED JOY trailed.
