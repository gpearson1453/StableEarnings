OSCAR WINNER WALLY tracked the top pair while saving ground through early stages, edged closer late on the turn, tipped three wide for the drive, given
cue at the furlong marker and kicked clear approaching the final sixteenth. SHIP BOSS hustled up out of the gate and matched strides with SHUT UP MAN
for the lead in the backstretch, continued to battle for command around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, fought on under firm handling but could
not hold off the winner late. SHUT UP MAN hustled up out of the gate and vied outside of SHIP BOSS, continued to battle around the turn, could not move
match strides for the lead at the head of the lane and weakened to show. LORD OF THE PALACE chased the top trio along the outside in early stages,
failed to gain closer contention on the turn, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and steadily faded.

RUDIANO sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, continued to hold firm still unleashed around the turn, turned back the bid from
WAR RASCAL turning for home, pulled away under a drive then finished in hand. WAR RASCAL was forwardly placed tracking the leader up the
backstretch, was hard ridden two wide racing in close contention around the turn, could not reach the pulling away winner in the lane but sustained a steady
bid and finished second best. OUTOFQUEMADO raced off the clear top two leaders in early stages, hustled up three wide into upper stretch and secured a
share. MEET GEORGE JETSON raced in the back, came four wide into the lane and never menaced.

Footnotes
PIPPA'S PROSPECT raced in range saving ground just off the compact early flight, edged closer along the rail at the quarter pole, tipped three wide at the
head of the lane, kicked in gamely and got up in time. KID BIZ raced up close in the opening quarter, vied for the lead with HER NAME WAS LOLA at the
quarter pole, could not match strides with rival at the head of the lane, stayed on with response, dug back in gamely, moved up approaching the sixteenth
pole, briefly gained the lead then got denied in final strides. HER NAME WAS LOLA set a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead with KID BIZ
at the quarter pole, shook free turning for home, stayed on gamely then got overtaken in final stages. SPITFIRE SUZIE pressed the pace up the backstretch
and into the turn then steadily weakened. ROUNDABOUT lacked speed and raced in the back, came four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally.
FLYWHEEL EFFECT pressed the pace in the opening quarter, chased into the turn then gave way near the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
TEXTHELEGEND was unhurried and saved ground up the backstretch, picked up the pace three furlongs from home, shifted out near the quarter pole, set
down three wide for the drive, steadily edged up closer, dug in gamely and got a nose up on the wire. CLASSIC BET led the way around the first turn and
set the pace up the backstretch, turned back bids around the far turn, continued clear a furlong out then got caught in final stride. DANCE SOME MO was
forwardly placed around the first turn and up the backstretch, hustled up three wide around the far turn, weakened off the leader in the stretch but ran on
and lasted for a share. WARRIOR'S RUN was reserved and raced in the back, saved ground around the far turn, hustled along into upper stretch and just
missed show. UXMAL stalked the pace up the backstretch, continued in contention into the final turn then gave way neat the quarter pole. ALYANAABI
raced off the early pace and steadily retreated. KYANDI rated near midpack through early stages, raced up close inside to two wide around the far turn then
quickly retreated in the lane and vanned off.

Footnotes
FABRICATOR was unhurried and saved ground up the backstretch, was under a drive along the rail leaving the far turn, steadily edged up closer racing two
to three wide then shifted to an opening on the rail, kicked in gamely and got a nose up on the wire. RIDING THE TRAIN sped to the lead soon after the
start and led the way up the backstretch, dueled inside of ROBUST around the far turn, battled on into upper stretch, took a slim lead, led late two wide and
got nailed on the wire by rail running winner. IT'S ALL ABOUT JOE rated just off the top trio in the opening quarter, picked up the pace late on the turn,
given cue three wide at the head of the lane, roused forward into close contention, continued to inch up four wide nearing the wire but failed to get by in
time. ROBUST tracked the leader in the opening quarter, dueled for the lead with RIDING THE TRAIN around the turn, continued to race in striking distance
into the final furlong then yielded late. GABRIEL'S LEGEND settled through early stages, chased four wide around the turn and lacked a needed rally in the
lane. PASSING TIME chased the top pair up the backstretch then weakened around the turn. FREEDOM FLASH raced midpack in the opening quarter then
steadily faded. WILD APPEAL raced three wide around the turn and never threatened.
