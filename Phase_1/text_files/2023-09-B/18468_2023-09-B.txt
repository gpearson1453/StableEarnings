Footnotes
CENTURION settled off the early pace, moved up two to three wide around the far turn and finished strongly to be well clear while racing under steady
pressure. LEVY dropped back off the early pace, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole to challenge, came in nearing the sixteenth pole, forced
Thankgodngreyhound to take up sharply, a stewards inquiry and jockey objection was filed for interference and stewards disqualified Levy and placed fifth.
PUNCTUALITY stalked the pace, raced near the rail throughout, was bumped near the sixteenth pole and kept on to the wire. PLATINUM GHOST stalked
the pace from the outside of rivals, raced five deep into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. THANKGODNGREYHOUND showed good early foot
from the inside, collared 3/16 from the inside, forced to check sharply nearing the sixteenth pole and weakened thereafter. IZEONDEC raced off the early
pace, swung wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. LEMONADEATTHELATCH void of early speed, raced near the inside throughout and had no
response. TIME TO MEDDLE tracked the early leader from the outside and gave way.

interest while racing from the outside. BABY NO WORRIES was off slowly, raced four wide around the far turn and never threatened. NEW BOSS dropped
back off the early pace, raced four deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no response. READY FOR CHANGE coaxed along early, raced from the

Footnotes
ANGELICO tracked outside of Chitwood down the backstretch, took a narrow lead approaching the eighth pole, dug in late and prevailed under strong
handling. BACK TO REALITY dropped back to race mid pack early, raced from the inside around the far turn, was three to four deep in the drive and
finished gamely to the wire. COLONEL BARTON settled off the early pace setters, raced two to three wide around the far turn and moved up to improve
position through the latter stages. CHITWOOD showed good early speed, was collared nearing the eighth pole and weakened from the inside. BLUES
ADMIRAL stalked the pace from the outside, hard ridden to challenge four deep near the quarter pole and flattened out. SAVAGE KISS unhurried early on,
saved ground and had no rally. AZTECA STAR raced with the second flight, was three to four wide in the drive and had no response. VALUABLE CARGO
was shuffled back at the break, moved up five wide around the far turn, raced from the outside in the lane and never threatened. PROSECUTION lag early
on, raced near the inside and lacked a bid. OFF THE CUFF stalked the top pair from the outside and stopped.

Footnotes
FIGHTING BACK was off a step slow, moved up four wide near the five sixteenths pole and finished strongly in the drive to draw off under steady handling.
GUADALAJARA settled off the early pace, moved up from the far outside in the stretch and rallied late for the place position. SPEED INSTITUTE was off a
step slow, rated along early, asked nearing the three eighths pole and kept on to the wire racing three to four wide. UNWRAPPED showed good early foot
from the inside and weakened through the drive. AWAY FROM HOME rated along from the inside, continued an inside run past the quarter pole and
weakened a bit through the drive. BATTLE BORN tracked the early from the outside, raced three wide between near the five sixteenths pole and faded in
the drive. ROUNDBALL ROCK raced at the back of the pack early, saved ground through the far turn, angled out to race well off the inside near the three
sixteenths pole and never threatened.

pressured pace along the inside and weakened in the latter stages. CREEK was bumped at the start, rated along early, blocked near the three sixteenth
pole from the inside and kept on to the wire. POLAR BEAR PLUNGE raced with the second flight early, raced five to four wide in the lane and had not
enough. SMOKEY SMOKEY bumped soundly at the start, pressed the early leader from the outside, checked near the sixteenth pole racing between and

Footnotes
CURRENT CLIMATE tracked the pace from the outside, challenged three wide around the far turn, dug in through the drive and prevailed in a determined
effort under strong handling. LADY GOLDSTART was shuffled back at the start, raced off the early pace, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and
finished gamely to the wire. MAJESTIC D'ORO was allowed to settle early, raced near the inside past the three eighths pole, swung wide into the upper
stretch and finished gamely to the wire. LITTLE JEWEL rated along early, raced three to four wide between in the drive and moved up late to improve
position. LAURA'S CHARM set a pressured pace along the inside and weakened through the drive. SHOWGIRL LYNNE B pressed the early leader from
the outside and faded. MIMAJOON dropped back to race mid pack, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. PROMISE OF HOPE
void of early speed, raced three to four wide in the drive and lacked a rally. FRANKEL BABY stalked the pace, raced along the inside around the far turn
and faded.
