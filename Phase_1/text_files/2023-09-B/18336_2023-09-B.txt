Footnotes
PRIVATE DESIRE showed good speed on the outside of a rival, moved to a solo lead near the nine-sixteenths, was challenged to his outside at the
half-mile pole, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the lead to the runner-up in upper stretch, responded well and fought
back to regain the advantage near the furlong marker, passed the sixteenth-pole under a right-handed crop and prevailed under good handling.
HURRICANE NELSON broke very fast and went straight to the front, gave up the lead when joined on the outside by the winner early, was taken back off
the pace outside the nine-sixteenths then switched to the outside, moved up to make an outside bid at the half-mile pole, was asked in the three path on the
turn, took a short lead in upper stretch, lost the advantage back to that foe near the eighth-pole, drifted in closer to the winner in the final furlong and was
outfinished while well clear for the place. HEARTENED was last to commence, raced well off the pace under urging, went three wide on the turn, came four
wide into the stretch and was along for the show. IGNITE THE LIGHT was well placed just off the pace, dropped back in the two path on the turn, was
driven three wide into the stretch and came up empty. COMMANDER OF TRUTH angled out under urging early then chased the pace on the outside,
dropped back in the four path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. BOUNTEOUS dropped well behind while void of speed, moved from the
four path to the two path on the turn and was no factor. HEDGE THE RISK was coaxed along on the inside, dropped back while saving ground on the turn
and capitulated.

Footnotes
VICTORIOUS WAVE coaxed from the gate, chased three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four then three wide into upper stretch,
rallied to take command near the eighth pole, inched away under a drive to prevail. OCEAN'S RESERVE five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole and went six wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors. KOOL KATHMANDU led early on briefly before
being displaced on the front by BEZOS, chased that rival in closest aim just off the inside, got let out continuing just off the inside into upper stretch, took
brief command at the three-sixteenths, got headed for the front nearing the eighth pole and shied in a bit sharply being flashed the crop to the right side at
that station, ran on shying in a bit more slight at the sixteenth marker when shown the crop to the right side once more and was along clear for the show
honors. CAPONE coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and was
one paced through to the finish. BEZOS away near the rear of the field without incident, advanced inside early on to take over command five furlongs from
home, showed the way in hand coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch under threat, yielded the front at the
three-sixteenths and weakened. SUGAR GRAY LEONARD stumbled at the start conceding three to four lengths to the front before being able to settle into
stride, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an
impact. LEDDY broke slow and then was sluggish early on and was guided outside to be six paths off the rail down the backstretch, tucked four wide
through the turn coming under coaxing midway, cornered five wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RHIANNON stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, engaged the leader on the far turn, was asked while taking the advantage outside the
quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and powered away under a solid hand-ride to prove much the best. AKAYLA (IRE) broke out at the start, settled
on the inside, was roused on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. WAR PRINCESS went to
the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked with three furlongs to run, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole, dropped back into upper stretch and
weakened but was clear for the show. VANISHED went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked three wide on the far turn, chased into
the stretch and came up empty. AFRICAN WATERS broke awkwardly and was slow to begin, was carried out early, went three wide on the first turn, settled
at the back, was roused three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. PIPPI LONGSTOCKING was off slow and spotted
the front a few lengths, angled in at the rear, settled on the inside, was given her cue on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to
respond. MISS OUR HERO was taken in hand at the start then dropped back, angled out early, rounded the first turn in the four path, settled on the outside,
was asked three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and also failed to respond.

AIR SHOW chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, angled in to the inside at the
three-sixteenths, rallied up the rail to take command nearing the sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish kept to task. QUICKFLASH coaxed from
the gate, dueled along the inside of POPPY'S PRIDE early on before being shaken off by that foe, tipped out and advanced once more from the two path
midway on the turn to knock heads again, swung four wide into upper stretch, continued the duel through to the finish getting displaced in tandem from the
front nearing the sixteenth pole and ran on to best his pace rival for the place honors by a sliver. POPPY'S PRIDE coaxed from the start, dueled from the
three path with QUICKFLASH to his inside down the backstretch, shook off that rival and tucked inside half a mile from home, had that foe advance once
more midway on the turn now engaging from the outside and dueled again from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, continued the head
to head combat through to the wire getting overtaken by the top one as a pair near the sixteenth marker, ran on but was just bested for the place honors
while clear for the show. FLAMINGO HAWK coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide
into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. PRINCE JAMES chased three wide, got nudged four wide by BUSTIN SHOUT near the half mile pole, chased
four then three wide through the turn nudging that rival back inwards with three furlongs to go, swung five wide for home and offered no response. BUSTIN
SHOUT chased just off the inside, tipped out three wide nudging PRINCE JAMES four wide near the half mile pole, was inside that rival and got leaned on
slightly and nudged back to the two path midway on the turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened.

CATCH THAT PARTY was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, saved ground while unhurried at the rear, went three wide on the final turn, swung
six wide into upper stretch, was corrected off heels with a tug of the left-rein outside the eighth-pole, rallied into the final furlong, closed fast into the final
sixteenth and blew by the leading duo to win going away. CYBER NINJA saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, went around the second turn in
the two path, continued off the rail down the backstretch, was asked on the final turn, came three wide into the stretch, chased under a drive into the final
furlong, gained to make a bid into the final sixteenth and finished with good courage for the place while unable to match strides with the winner. ROYAL
SPIRIT was taken in hand early, saved ground on the first turn, moved closer to the lead near the wire for the first time, rounded the second turn in the two
path, tracked outside down the backstretch, made a bid on the final turn, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, dueled with a foe into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished while just able to get the show. LAUREL VALLEY angled in while going to the front, showed the way while inside on the turns,
was asked outside the quarter-pole, spun off the rail under left-rein guidance into the stretch, dueled with ROYAL SPIRIT into the final sixteenth and was
out-kicked then just missed the show. HOLD THE SALSA settled while two to three wide, was asked along the rail on the final turn, chased the vanguard in
the stretch and lacked the needed kick. SCRAMBLE broke in and bumped with a foe, settled outside while three to four wide, ranged up on the final turn,
was asked outside the quarter-pole, raced off heels while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch, chased while put to a right-handed crop nearing the
furlong marker and weakened then was reported to have bled. RAMBLIN' WRECK was bumped at the start, settled in the two to three path, was roused on
the final turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. BEE MAJOR went three then two wide on the first turn, settled off the pace,
saved ground on the second turn, continued inside down the backstretch, came up empty along the rail under urging on the final turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SKYLANDER was well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, waited while lacking room behind horses from the quarter-pole into upper
stretch, was asked while altering out inside the three-sixteenths, accelerated to the front into the final furlong and drew away under steady urging.
WARRIOR RICHARD settled off the pace, drafted along the rail on the turn, waited behind horses at the quarter-pole, shifted out four wide into upper
stretch, chased into the final furlong and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. THUNDERIAN dropped well behind the rest of the field,
saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and improved to just miss the place while able to get the show. KUNSHAN BRIDGE
showed speed between horses, dropped off the pace inside the three-quarter pole then moved out, tracked the pace from that point, moved up to make an
outside bid at the half-mile pole, vied in the four then three path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, battled into the final furlong and proved no
match for the winner then lost the trifecta. AMERICAN LAW showed speed on the outside then contested the pace, vied in the three then two path on the
turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. ARREBATO settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn and lacked the needed
response. RIDE UP bobbled after the start, showed speed on the inside of foes then contested the pace, vied in the two path early on the turn then moved
to the rail, dropped back into upper stretch and faltered.

tucking to the two path through the turn, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and was let out straightened away, drew off under a drive to prevail.
VITTORIO got bumped at the start by TOPS THE CHART due to pressure from SHIVAREE, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three wide for home, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. CASTLE
CHAOS got bumped at the start by JAKE ROCKS, who broke inwards, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. EMERALD FOREST chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path
through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. SEVEN NATION
ARMY chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and weakened. TOPS THE CHART broke open the stall door prior to the start just after TWENTY FOUR MAMBA grew fractious, got
bumped at the start by SHIVAREE and in turn bumped VITTORIO, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide
for home and weakened. JAKE ROCKS broke in at the start bumping CASTLE CHAOS, chased along the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from
home, swung three wide at the head of the stretch and weakened. TWENTY FOUR MAMBA grew fractious in the gate inspiring TOPS THE CHART to
break open his stall door, chased along the inside until tipped to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six
wide into upper stretch and made no impact. KING ANGELO chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. SHIVAREE broke in at the start bumping TOPS THE CHART
into VITTORIO, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from midway, went six to seven

on the final turn, rallied six wide into the stretch, closed strongly to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with the runner-up to the finish and narrowly
prevailed under strong urging. NEECIE MARIE was hustled from the gate then taken in hand early, settled while inside to the two path, was urged in the two
path on the final turn, gained three wide into the stretch, moved in while chasing into the final furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, battled with the

show. HIGHLAND GRACE settled in the two to three path, was asked on the final turn, came four wide into the stretch, rallied to make a bid inside the
furlong marker but was out-kicked and missed the trifecta. QUARREL showed in front early, was taken in hand when joined on the outside into the first turn,
raced in the two to three path while placed under vigorous restraint on that bend, followed the solo leader while rated in clear second position, gained on the
tiring pacesetter while moving from the rail to the three path on the far turn, took the lead while asked for her best in upper stretch, lost the advantage
outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened. STEPHANIE'S CHARM went to the front entering the first turn, sped clear while in the four to five path on that

backstretch, shortened stride in the two path on the final turn, was collared into upper stretch and capitulated. LAST CALL settled on the inside, was urged

at the start and came under coaxing leading briefly early on before being displaced by the top one, backed off to chase just off the inside in closest aim,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on to preserve the show honors. STREET VIEW two to three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. NADOWESSI (IRE) broke in

stretch, weakened. ARCHIVIST broke out at the start bumping TAP THE KEG, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. THAT'STHEFACTJACK three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four
wide into upper stretch and tired. DAISY'S ANGEL broke a half a beat slow and was bumped by KING'S DAUGHTER due to pressure from TAP THE KEG
breaking outwards, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and made no impact. TAP THE KEG broke out at the
start bumping KING'S DAUGHTER into DAISY'S ANGEL, and then got bumped by ARCHIVIST come outwards from along her inside, chased along the
