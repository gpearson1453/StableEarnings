Footnotes
LADY MAEVE (IRE) was forced inward a bit at the start bumping the inside foe in the process, stalked from outside just off the leading pair into the turn,
came out five wide turning for home, struck the lead at the three-sixteenths while lugging in a bit, straightened out and kicked clear then held safe. WICKED
MIAH was bumped at the break while getting away a step slowly, raced inside toward the back saving ground on or just off the rail through the turn, came
out a bit in upper stretch then was guided out five wide passing the three-sixteenths for room, gained the place. MAKE NO MISTAKE broke inwardly a bit at
the start, was outpaced early racing at the back, moved out from three to four wide early on the turn, swung out six wide for the drive, ran on mildly.
SPEEDY LYNN pulled a bit in the early going keenly racing inside and just off the leader, was wrangled back and switched out, shadowed that one's flank
into the turn three wide, moved to challenge late on that bend taking the lead at the top of the stretch, was overtaken and had no extra late. CHEEKY PINT
got away well, tracked from inside, saved ground, came out about the three-sixteenths, failed to rally and went evenly. SILENT GUROO broke sharply,
shifted in while setting the pace, was pressured by an outside foe racing just off the rail through the turn, overtaken at the top of the stretch and faded late.
COLOR FORCE pursued from outside early, moved in from four to three wide on the turn, failed to menace.

Footnotes
MORE SAVVY tracked the contesting duo outside at the half, waited to pounce midway on the turn, swung out to the four path to be in thick of things and
found another gear late to surge on by in the final sixteenth. SUGAR IS GOLDEN was content to track the frontrunner just outside in the beginning, forced
the issue hounding the pacesetter through the turn, took command driving to the wire and fought on gamely to the finish but could not hold off the closing
winner at the line. SILENT GHOST took this field down the backside, had a narrow advantage inside throughout the turn, was collared outside at the top of
the lane, stubbornly battled on the fence to the wire but was outfinished in the final sixteenth. OHEAVENS made an early move down the backside for better
position inside to be in close range of the leaders at the half, settled nicely on the fence watching the contesting pair through the turn, loomed in the three
path turning for home but could not offer a finish down the lane. IVY'S STAR broke inwards at the start, stalked outside in the third flight down the
backstretch, made little headway on the turn and had good late energy to close in on rivals in deep stretch. AIRY FAIRY was three deep outside tracking the
engaging twosome down the backstretch, settled all alone in the third flight running throughout the turn, shifted outside three wide at the quarter pole gaining
momentum to be in range in the five path straightening out for the drive, could not find another gear and flattened out in the final furling. STORMY SUZIE
was void of early speed trailing down the backside, could not get interested seeing the field on the turn and could not reach contention driving to the wire.

Footnotes
JUST ON TIME broke on top, shifted in early to about the two path while clear and setting the early tempo, was pressured and overtaken soon after, tracked
the leading pair in behind on the turn just off the rail, swung out five wide leaving that bend, drove past late. FILM bumped a rival lightly at the start, was
carried in a bit then switched outside the aforementioned in the early going, moved forward between runners to a narrow lead about the seven-sixteenths,
was pressured by an outside rival through the turn, dispatched that one to be clear by mid-stretch but was no match for the winner. YOGA broke a step
slowly, moved forward outside, prompted the leader three to four wide into and on the turn, had no extra in late stretch. GAVEL GIRL was
forwardly-positioned along the rail in behind the early leader, steadied past the seven-sixteenths and altered out, swung seven wide into upper stretch, failed
to sustain a late bid. FIRE EMOJI was lightly bumped at the start, forced in a bit soon after and dropped back to the rear, raced outside a foe into the turn,
was forced out and bumped about the three-eighths, failed to threaten. ALMONTE PRINCESS steadied on heels altering outside a rival and bumping
another foe near the three-eighths, was never a threat. FOLLOWING OBJECTIONS BY THE TRAINER OF GAVEL GIRL AGAINST JUST ON TIME, THE
TRAINER OF FIRE EMOJI AGAINST GAVEL GIRL, AND THE RIDER OF FIRE EMOJI AGAINST JUST ON TIME, ALL WERE DISALLOWED AND
RESULTS WERE TO STAND AS IS.

Footnotes
SPEEDY RIVER took command from the start, was unchallenged on the turn opening up at will, had a comfortable advantage turning for home and was
kept to the task mildly to cruise home for the win. ORPHAN HALLIE rated kindly alone behind the chasing trio down the backside, rallied on the fence with
five sixteenths to run, burst between horses in the two path at the top of the lane and was full of run down the stretch easily besting the rest at the line.
HIGHLAND SOCIETY was tucked in behind the winner on the rail down the backstretch, chase the winner in vain through the turn, began to fade some in
mid-stretch beheld on to be a clear third crossing the line. BOKERMIN was allowed to settle outside near the back of the pack down the back straight,
began picking up runners outside midturn, was pushed out widest in the six path for the stretch run and offered a solid late run to settle on the fringes at the
finish. UPSTART GENTLEMAN broke with the field but could not keep up in the early going, made little progress running on the turn and had good late
energy surging on the fence through the stretch to just miss for a small share in the end. TRANQUILITY BASE prompted outside four deep with four
furlongs to go, urged three wide midway on the turn, was involved for the minors in the three path straightening out for the drive to the finish and faded in
deep stretch losing positions at the wire. TALL WATER was eager under restraint by the rider down the backside, checking mildly, was roused when shifting
out at the quarter pole, swung four wide for the stretch drive but could not make any impact down the lane. STRIKING HEIR pressed between runners three
wide at the half mile marker, could not quicken with others on each side giving way three furlongs from the line and retreated at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
LADY WELLINGTON contested the pace inside, took the lead after a brief spat, moved clear, held sway while being kept to the task. MOMUNNYFOR RO
shifted in, saved ground on the turn but was in tight quarters in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths steadying slightly, came out five wide in mid-stretch for
room, kicked on well to get up for place late. FEDOROVA got away well, stalked the leading pair outside a foe, advanced nearer the inside on the turn
shifting out leaving that bend, could not make headway on the winner and lost place late. SILENT ATTACK raced off the pace in behind runners two to three
wide on the turn, steadied on heels slightly nearing the quarter pole and seeking room, found it four wide at the top of the stretch but ran on evenly
thereafter. SPEED INTHE FOREST broke a step slowly, moved up inside but lacked room and steadied slightly at the half and again at the
seven-sixteenths, switched out going two wide early on the turn, angled six wide past the quarter pole, ran on mildly. GET MY DRIFT chased saving ground
near the rail on the turn into upper stretch and ran on evenly. PORSHAS RUN tossed the head and broke outwardly bumping a rival lightly, raced off the
pace into the turn, advanced four then five wide on that bend, kept on evenly. TABLOID MATERIAL was lightly bumped at the start, pursued from outside a
foe, was able to drop in a bit heading into the turn racing three wide on that bend, faded. HOBBIE CLASS broke a step slowly and just a hair tight, raced
well back inside a rival and made no impact. ROHESE broke a step slowly, raced well back outside a foe and made no impact. TIME TO WATCH showed
brief speed, dueled momentarily then retreated three to four wide.

GUILDSMAN (FR) was unhurried near the rear three deep outside down the back straight, rated comfortably three wide in the third flight through the turn,
swung outside of runners in the seven path to uncork a rally, lengthening stride in upper stretch and got up for a measured win a few jumps before the wire.
MASTER SPY was nestled on the rail under a snug hold down the backside, had good position on the fence tracking the dueling pair on the turn, threatened
inside straightening for home, took control at the eighth pole but could not fend off the winner late in a solid runner up effort. JACK THE CAT stalked on the
rail in the third flight in the beginning, improved inside three furlongs from the finish, had clear run on the fence turning for home and put in a good rally late
to be a distant third at the wire. CHANCEL pressed the pace outside down the backstretch, hounded the frontrunner through the turn, had a brief lead
straightening out for the drive and faded mildly late but holding for a small piece of the prize in the end. TOMCAT BLACK trailed the field in the early stages,
could still see the field running on the turn, swung outside for run seven wide driving to the line and finished with intent passing tired rivals through the
stretch. UNION COLONEL set the fractions down the backside, maintained a slim advantage inside running throughout the turn, was clinging to the lead at
the top of the stretch inside, could not find another gear when asked and yielded between horses in the final furlong. MAYITO stalked between foes in the
third flight, shifted out four wide at the quarter pole when roused, offered little response and could not get involved running through the stretch. DOT'S
VISION tracked three wide outside with four furlongs remaining, angled outside with some momentum at the quarter pole to be five wide turning for home
and drifted inwards driving to the finish in mid-stretch but had little to show running to the wire. YORKVILLE tracked the front pair running between foes at
the half, shifted outside gaining three wide with three furlongs to go, posed a threat in the six path at the top of the lane but could not find more and faltered
between at the furlong marker.

CALUSA DONNIE tucked in settling in behind the leaders near the inside, bided time in last through the far turn, angled five wide leaving that bend, struck
the lead past the eighth pole, drifted in gradually, held. THE THUNDERER broke just a bit awkwardly, settled outside a foe at the back but not too far off the
leaders, advanced four wide on the far turn taking the lead at the quarter pole, drifted in while clear in upper- to mid-stretch, was overtaken past the eighth
pole and settled for second best. VINCENZINO moved forward inside setting the early tempo with outside pressure, was headed leaving the first turn and
still continued to contend inside, saved ground through the far turn, could not kick on with the top pair but got show honors. JACK contested the pace
outside a foe taking a narrow lead about the three-quarters, vied between runners on the far turn, weakened in the stretch. GUARD OF HONOUR stalked
just off the leaders three wide, was in contention coming to the quarter pole but lacked the needed late kick.

Footnotes
PERSONAL PURSUIT tracked comfortably in the two path with runners on either side in the early going, was patiently handled behind the wall of leaders
running on the turn, found a clear lane in the four path in upper stretch, exploded by rivals by the eight pole and won easily, going away convincingly in the
end. CARDIO PRINCESS (JPN) stumbled at the break, was hustled to battle with runners on each side for the front down the back straight, dueled between
setting the fractions through the turn, gamely found more in mid-stretch and won the battle for place crossing the line. BORN TO BOOGIE was eager early
on tracking the front three on the rail down the backside, waited to move on the fence through the turn, looked for a seam turning for home, was steadied
when in tight at the furlong pole, shifted out off a tiring leader and closed for third at the wire. I'M INTO MISCHIEF pressed for the front on the rail, had a
narrow lead hounded outside by two rivals throughout the turn, was collared outside by the winner three sixteenths from the finish and faded on the fence in
deep stretch. HOT CARGO was three deep outside in the tracking threesome down the backstretch, made an early move four wide around horses three
furlongs from the prize, angled out widest in range of the leaders in the six path at the top of the lane but needed more and stalled at the furlong marker.
PROUD SPEAKER prompted three deep down the backside, keep pace contesting three wide up front on the turn, was the first one of the early speed trio
to give way turning for home in the five path and weakened in mid-stretch.

STOLEN MONEY set the pace racing just off the fence and in the clear, had enough in reserve to kick away and hold sway under steady handling. GREEN
FLEET tracked mid-pack saving some ground inside a rival just off the fence, took closer order on the far turn, drifted out in mid-stretch, was no match for
the winner but was second best. EMBRACE MY UNCLE was urged at the start but lacking speed, saved some ground near the rail racing toward the rear,
kept on inside in the stretch to gain show honors. SIR SAHIB settled between foes heading into the first turn, raced about two to four wide through the early
going outside and toward the back, made a swift advance while shifting out from three to five wide on the far turn looming a mild threat past the quarter pole
but could not sustain the effort and evened out. H C HOLIDAY stalked from outside mid-pack traveling mostly three to four wide, had no late bid.
SEVENTYSEVEN STONE lacked early speed, was caught outside foes three to four wide early, brought up the rear into the far turn, failed to menace. KING
ALFREDO stalked the eventual winner about three wide, faded.

Footnotes
ROYAL BLUSH had a good trip watching the top two, tracking three wide outside down the backside, continued to enjoy an ideal trip three wide waiting to
pounce on the contesting duo on the turn, loomed in the six path for the drive and wore down the rivals through stretch to get up for the win in the last few
jumps in a well timed finish. FRIENDS FOR LIFE was checked mildly in the early part of the backstretch, tracked the pacesetter early on, hounded the
frontrunner outside on the turn, took over control between rivals with three sixteenths to go, determinedly battled on to the wire but just missed holding for
the win at the finish. FOXY DIVA settled close to the back of the pack four deep down the back straight away, was allowed to find its feet trailing on the turn,
started to gain momentum at the three furlong marker, carried her rally swinging out widest in the eight path for the stretch run outside foes and was full of
run gaining with every stride late but could not get there in time. BEDAZZLE ME settled in midfield rating kindly on the turn inside, angled out trying to push
her way in the six path at the top of the lane and stubbornly fought on at the furlong marker to get up for a minor share in the end. BEQUIA settled in
mid-pack three wide down the backstretch, took closer order under a vigorous ride three wide at the three furlong pole, was pushed out in the seven path for
the stretch run and finished one paced down the lane. INSCRUTABLE trailed on the rail in the beginning, improved on the fence through the turn, had a
clear run up the rail if good enough in the stretch drive and finished up willingly, passing weary foes in the stretch. BIJOU BABY stalked in the two path
between horses down the backside, was roused for more run three wide three furlongs from the finish, made little headway and could not get into contention
through the stretch run. GOLDEN SUZIE watched the top pair engage tracking between runners in the two path at the half mile marker, rallied four wide at
the quarter pole to be in the hunt for a small piece of the prize but could not find more in the final furlong and flattened out late. WELL ACTUALLY cleared to
the rail, leading at the three quarters marker, had a narrow advantage running inside through the turn, was collared outside in upper stretch and stopped in
the last sixteenth. RAVELLO BEAUTY hopped at the break, stalked near the rear between rivals three wide in the early stages, made little progress running
on the turn and never was a presence in the stretch run. FLOWERS 'N BERRIES broke out at the start, had good position nestled on the rail down the
backside in the second flight, kept pace with the leaders throughout the turn and retreated inside in mid-stretch.
