STRONG DEMAND raced between horses around first turn, inside run down the backstretch and rallied well clear under good handling to the wire.
EXPLOSIVE SKIES no speed while saving ground to far turn, rallied along for place, no match for winner. PONDERED chased leader from inside, took over
far turn, weakened for show. MACI'S GEMSTONE no speed throughout, widest run past quarter pole while no menace. UNCOMMON GRACE was through
early and dropped far back readily in the stretch and returned bleeding, walked off. MAE BEE RIGHT sprinted off to long lead but stopped to a walk far back
at wire while vanned off following the finish.

Footnotes
WHERE'D THE DAY GO quick to the front outside, well rationed throughout, held sway to the wire. LORD REVELSTOKE never far back early on, took up
chase while no match to wire. NOBLE PURSUIT unhurried early on, angled out far turn, late run to cut the gap. CACAHUETE pressed pace throughout with
no late response when needed. ENGLISH CLASSIC no speed to far turn with no late response when needed. HOLIDAY DANCER between horses first turn,
could not keep up and faded back. ERIC THE SALESMAN saved ground to no avail throughout. HONEST TO GOODNESS through after three quarters.
Race was hand timed due to a bad sensor on the turf course, all turf races will be hand timed for the remainder of the meet. Acm
