Footnotes
SHANGHAI POINT rated on the front end toward the outside on the backstretch, moved clear when allowed three wide on the bend, widened command and
angled in upper stretch, weaved out and back in inside the last eighth but maintained full control under steady handling. BACKSHOT prominent between
horses, was steadied from the half mile marker to the seven-sixteenths pole behind traffic, got through three wide leaving the turn and pulled clear for
second the final furlong. TAPIT SAM helped prompt the pace from outside, lost ground four wide through the bend, lacked the needed late bid but edged
ahead for third late. STUMP vied for the lead between rivals, did not stay with SHANGHAI POINT while two wide on the turn and slowly wore down for the
drive. ONE WAY HOME also contested the pace between horses on the backstretch but began to fade along the rail before finishing a half mile. IT'S
BELLAMY TIME hustled vigorously from inside, gave way along the rail before the end of three furlongs.

Footnotes
PACHI rated from outside, commenced his bid four wide on the bend, floated out to path six for the drive, took over nearing the sixteenth marker then drew
off under a well-judged ride. CHICKS FOR FREE was away slowly, settled at the back, two wide on the turn, angled out seven wide upper stretch, surged
the last furlong, angled in through the waning yards and caught READTHETRANSCRIPT for second. READTHETRANSCRIPT advanced to contention
three wide on the turn, fanned out further into the lane, took over second between horses then leveled off in the late going. WINGING WAYS bumped with R
H SMOAKEM at the break, quickly moved clear of the rest but flattened out inside the last eighth. SOUPER FORTUNE chased from between horses, came
four wide into the lane and had no late rally. MUD ISLAND raced closest to the early speed, threatened two wide on the bend, floated out some into the
stretch and began to fade. R H SMOAKEM never far off the inside, failed to menace. JOHNNY LONGBOAT showed little.

Footnotes
CAHOKIA POSSE advanced in tight quarters to vie for the lead between rivals on the backstretch, was two wide on the bend, gained the rail upper stretch,
took the lead inside the last eighth, was clear of the rest with a sixteenth left and held WICKED SKY at bay under steady handling. WICKED SKY forwardly
placed toward the outside, progressed four wide on the turn and rallied belatedly in the lane. FERGIE ATTACK vied for the early lead outside rivals, moved
ahead of the rest three wide on the bend but began to slowly wear down inside the final furlong. HER SPEAKER'S ON somewhat awkward at the break,
advanced between horses, angled out through the turn, came five wide into the stretch, also found best stride too late but was clearly best of the rest.
SILVER EYES contested the pace from inside on the backstretch, did not keep up into the bend, gradually angled out, was four wide in the lane then ran
evenly the rest of the way. DON'T TELL ALYCE soon trailed, saved ground, passed tired ones upper stretch, altered out for a clear path inside the final
sixteenth and improved position without threatening. FEATURED POWER chased from outside, faded four wide on the turn, swung out further for the drive
and also passed some tired ones late. SKIP TO BALI displayed early speed between foes, gained the rail midway on the bend and began to fade before
finishing a half mile. MOLLY'S TEMPLE was a contender between horses on the backstretch but gave way three wide on the turn. HOT N FRESH showed
little in a wide trip.

Footnotes
JAMAICAN TRAFFIC stalked the early speed from outside, took the lead three wide when allowed on the bend then steadily opened up under urging in the
lane to prove much the best. CARICIA prominent between rivals, went for the lead two wide on the turn, was no match for JAMAICAN TRAFFIC when set
down for the drive, began to wear down deep stretch but lasted for the place. HIGHTAILING IT lugged in some leaving the chute, bumped SLEEPY CAT,
was altered to the outside, threatened four wide on the bend but leveled off in the lane. BLAZE BEAUTY void of early speed, was wide throughout, passed
tired ones upper stretch and made up minor ground on the place and show horses inside the final eighth. TINA'S TAPIZAR in contention early just off the
inside, altered in nearing the five-furlong marker trying to stay clear of CARICIA, bumped SLEEPY CAT, was steadied, retreated slightly from path three on
the bend and gave way for the stretch run. SLEEPY CAT overcame being bumped leaving the chute and near the five-furlong pole to set a pressured pace
but began to fade along the rail before finishing a half mile.

FROSTED ECLAIR rated on the front end from outside, moved clear from path two on the bend, floated out some entering the lane then maintained control
under steady urging. CANTOO hesitated at the break, gradually angled out as she advanced on the backstretch, lost ground four then five wide through the
turn, rallied in the stretch and took over second inside the last sixteenth. MOON PIES IMAGE without early speed, altered in with a half mile to go,
progressed two wide on the bend, altered out six wide for a clear path upper stretch, closed well and caught BE MY BESTIE for third. BE MY BESTIE
shared the lead between rivals on the backstretch, gained the rail into the turn, did not stay with FROSTED ECLAIR and gradually wore down the final
furlong. GHAALEB'S CITY a step slow at the start, moved to the inside early on, progressed along the rail on the bend, came off the inside some for a clear
path into the stretch, could only make up minor ground in the late going but was easily best of the others. SHINE DOWN broke slowly and failed to menace
in a wide trip. MUD HUT prompted the early pace from outside, was three then four wide through the turn and gave way for the drive. CANDY LOOKER
displayed brief speed from inside but steadily faded after a quarter mile.

SAMARITA rated off the early speed, progressed from outside after two furlongs, took the lead from path three entering the lane, moved clear and was kept
to urging until the last seventy yards. CATCHUSIFYOUCAN prominent outside PRINCESS STELLA, swung outside SAMARITA into the stretch, gained
second inside the final furlong, began to level off in the waning yards but lasted for the place. RONAN well back early, picked up her pace along the rail after
a quarter mile, swung out to path three entering the stretch, was crowded briefly inside the final eighth then pulled clear for third as she continued her bid the
last sixteenth. DOROTA moved to the inside midway on the backstretch, had a striking position along the rail on the bend, began to flatten in the lane,
altered out some for a clear path inside the furlong marker and finished evenly. PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) hesitated at the break then bore in, was
corrected, rushed up from inside to gain a clear lead before finishing the first eighth, was just off the rail taking the turn and gave way inside the final
three-sixteenths. PALACE MAGIC was a contender between rivals on the backstretch but faded two wide on the bend.

NOT TO BE DENIED soon had the lead, showed the way in hand from inside, moved clear when allowed on the second bend, came off the rail some
entering the lane, was all in the late going and kept WILDCAT BOBBIE at bay. WILDCAT BOBBIE settled well off the inside, commenced her bid after a half
mile, lost ground five wide through the second turn, continued her rally in the stretch, gradually lugged in as she closed on the weakening leader inside the
final furlong and had to settle for second best. THINK BLUE was four wide taking the first bend, gradually angled in on the backstretch to be just outside
NOT TO BE DENIED, did not stay with that one on the second turn, angled out some upper stretch and ran evenly the rest of the way. JULIAISON vied for
the lead briefly between rivals, was settled back once on the backstretch, had the rail through the second turn, lodged a mild bid to gain a striking position
with a furlong to go but leveled off instead. MY MORNING GAL settled well off the inside on the backstretch, made her bid four wide on the second bend but
weakened for the drive. MISS WINDY SLEW prominent between horses from the beginning, was three wide taking the second turn then gave way for the

Footnotes
FAST CROSS TRAFFIC was away slowly, cautious to avoid the loose horse leaving the chute, altered in soon after entering the main track, roused after
two furlongs, swiftly circled rivals under urging through the bend, came into the lane four wide, angled toward the inside upper stretch, steadily lengthened
command and was kept to task to the wire. RUN THE TABLE forwardly placed from outside, was three wide through the turn, battled for second inside the
final furlong and edged ahead for the place inside the last sixteenth. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN pressed ON THE MONEY RED from outside, drifted out badly
leaving the bend but was closing in for second through the waning yards. ON THE MONEY RED was hustled along to set a pressured pace from inside,
came off the rail some into the turn, was no match for FAST CROSS TRAFFIC when set down for the drive, was challenged for second nearing the final
sixteenth, slowly yielded and lugged in some approaching the wire. BRIANS WAY was shuffled back from tight quarters nearing the end of the first eighth,
advanced along the rail on the bend, lacked the needed late kick in the stretch and was steadied behind ON THE MONEY RED in the waning yards.
DIAMND CON SUERTE was also shuffled back from tight quarters before finishing the first furlong, retreated two wide on the turn and only made up minor
ground on the second flight deep stretch. TRUIST stumbled badly at the start and lost his rider. SKIP AWAY CARTER refused to start. There was a
stewards' inquiry into TRUIST'S and SKIP AWAY CARTER'S start. No action was taken after their review.
