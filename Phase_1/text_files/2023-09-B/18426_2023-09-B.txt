Footnotes
BROOKLYN DIAMONDS chased two to three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch taking over command,
went clear under a drive to prevail. UNION LIGHTS broke out a step at the start brushing CHEEKY TICO, chased three wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while along clear of the rest and second best. CHEEKY TICO got
brushed at the start by the aforementioned foe, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and improved position to be along for the show honors. KING OF CHAOS showed the way in hand along the inside coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front and took the inside route into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. BLU GROTTO a bit fractious in the
gate prior to the start, broke towards the front and then faded quickly when striding short and sluggish early on, grew detached at at the tail of the field seven
to eight paths off the inside, tucked over to the rail midway down the backstretch and continued along the inside through the turn, cornered two to three wide
into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. CUMBERLAND BLUES broke a beat slow, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked five wide into the turn and took the overland route through the bend coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. BERT BERT BERT hustled from the gate, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into
upper stretch, made no impact. PRINCE OF JOY chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into
upper stretch, faltered.

Footnotes
KUPP stumbled at the start, was taken under a tight hold while behind horses early, established a good position behind the solo leader, was asked in the
three path midway through the turn, rallied to the lead into upper stretch then drifted out some while moving clear, responded well under a right-handed crop
in the final furlong and held under strong urging. HIGH STRIKE was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn,
pursued the winner in the stretch, gained on that foe in the final sixteenth but missed while able to get the place. JESTER'S SONG settled off the pace,
moved in near the nine-sixteenths, advanced closer late on the backstretch, saved ground the turn, hugged the rail into the stretch, pursued the winner in
the drive and willingly earned the show. CHARGER was hustled from the gate then urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and lacked the
needed kick. ON THE COME UP broke out at the start, showed the way with a clear advantage, traveled around the turn in the two path, was headed into
upper stretch and tired. ROCK THE WEEKEND was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, raced at the rear while ridden along, went two then three
wide on the turn, angled out eight wide into upper stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
TODAY'S FLAVOR three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a
challenge a furlong out, took command a sixteenth from home and dug in gamely head to head to the finish to prevail. NOTHING BETTER coaxed from the
gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under threat and was collared nearing the sixteenth marker, fought on inside to the finish but was ultimately denied at the end. BRING ME A
CHECK broke out at the start applying pressure that made lanes tight for both HIGH FRONT and TODAY'S FLAVOR at the start, chased just off the inside
until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. HIGH
FRONT stumbled at the start bumping IKIGAI and then got forced to steady when losing his lane conceding two to three lengths to the front, chased three
wide until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. IKIGAI
got bumped at the start by HIGH FRONT who recovered into him from a stumble, chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went three wide into upper stretch, dug in prominent to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. SOSUA SUMMER
four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go, cut the corner into upper stretch, came up empty and trailed.

Footnotes
BOSS LADY KIM broke out and brushed the gate, allowed the pacesetter to cross in front early then tracked that foe on the outside, made a bid late on the
backstretch, took the lead with three furlongs to run, moved clear while going from the two to three path late on the turn and drew off under steady urging.
RACING COLORS settled off the pace, moved out near the five-eighths pole, was urged four wide on the turn, remained on her inside lead until inside the
furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and earned the place. SIMPLE SUGAR bumped with a rival at the start, was reserved behind horses, found
clear room in front late on the backstretch, was urged three wide on the turn then driven four wide into the stretch, remained on her inside lead in the drive
and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH settled just off the pace, chased inside on the turn and came up
empty. ROJA LIGERA broke out and brushed the gate, angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, lost
the lead with three furlongs to run, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and tired. JUST A NYQUIST bumped with a rival at the start, was hard ridden off
the pace, went four then three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. MEMENTO MI dropped well behind, moved from the rail to the two path late on the
turn, spun three wide into the stretch and was no factor. SWEET AS SUGAR was well placed just off the pace, dropped back near the five-eighths pole,
raced inside to the two path on the turn and capitulated. REDZILLA was urged along on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn and faltered. PER
RULING FROM HIWU, RACING COLORS WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, shied and drifted out two to three paths straightened away under a left handed crop, dug
in rallying to collar the once clear leader seventy yards from the finish and inched away in the late stages to the end. WOODSIDE WARRIOR vied from the
four path with a pair to his inside, tucked three wide and dueled with PRIX DE WEST from the seven-sixteenths when shaking away as a pair from BAD
LARRY, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat to the outside and was caught
seventy yards from the finish, then ran on to be along well clear of the rest and second best. BAD LARRY broke out at the start under coaxing and vied
inside a pair down the backstretch, got headed for the front at the seven-sixteenths and faded through the latter portion of the turn under coaxing, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, kept on to come again and secure the show honors. MUNNY FOR NUTHIN chased just off the inside coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, weakened. PRIX DE WEST coaxed from the gate, vied three wide between foes down the
backstretch before emerging with sole and narrow command at the seven-sixteenths, dueled through the turn with WOODSIDE WARRIOR to the outside,
got headed near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. WAR PRINCE broke out at the start and was
corrected, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish.
MAJESTIC ARC broke inwards and brushed the near side stall at the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and tired. TESTA DURA chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn
under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. DREAM CANTEEN coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, made no impact. IMPULSIVE SPENDING lost his rear footing at the start getting

Footnotes
AVENUE NIEL (IRE) moved in while taken under restraint early, was reserved in the two path while traveling comfortably, swung four wide into the stretch,
rallied on the outside, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker, shook clear into the final sixteenth and held under good handling.
RHOMBIQUE was reserved on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, came through inside of the pacesetter in
the final furlong and finished fast to get the place. PENTAGON was taken up on the first turn then rated between foes in the two path, came under urging
while two then three wide on the final turn, rallied inside of the winner to make a bid into the final furlong but was outfinished while just able to get the show.
EMBRACE ME lagged at the rear while saving ground, came out into the stretch then moved further out around the three-sixteenths and finished with good
energy to just miss the show. SISTER BRIDGET (IRE) went to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail going around the opening bend, showed the
way down the backstretch, was given her cue while inside on the far turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole, battled under a drive into the final furlong and
was outfinished. VIRTUAL REALITY pulled hard under restraint early, was reserved on the inside, came under encouragement on the far turn, chased the
vanguard in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. SHE'S MO BUBBLY went three then two wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was
asked in the two path on the far turn, took a short lead near the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final furlong then was headed and weakened. BILOXI
BLUES was keen under snug restraint early, went four then three wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, traveled three then four wide while given
her cue on the final turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. TANGENTIAL went three wide on the first turn, was coaxed along on the
outside, came up empty in the three path on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
KARA PARA four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced to take command near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper
stretch, edged clear under a drive kept to task. BON ADIEU chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into
upper stretch before tucking back to the inside near the eighth pole, ran on to procure the place honors. MURSAL chased two to three wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on for the show honors. FREUDIAN chased three to four wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to the finish. JOLLY MISS JILL got brushed at the
start by DIAMOND COLLECTOR while under coaxing, dueled from the two path with PROUD FOOT to her inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung three wide for home and weakened in the late stages. DOLCE SERA coaxed from the start, chased four to five wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, weakened. DIAMOND COLLECTOR broke out at the start brushing JOLLY MISS JILL, chased three then
two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. PROUD FOOT dueled along the inside of JOLLY MISS
JILL, was under a firm left handed grip and being flashed the crop to the right side while floating just off the rail through the turn, succumbed to the pressure
and yielded the front at the five-sixteenths marker, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY RUMOUR was rated in the two path through the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid near the half-mile pole, took the lead in
the three path at the quarter-pole, responded well under a drive into the final furlong, was guided in closer to the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole then
straightened before contact, fought outside that foe to the wire and just held under strong urging. SPUNGIE was taken under a tight hold early then rated
just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the pacesetter on the far turn, was asked while cutting the corner into the stretch, chased along the rail into the
final furlong, had the winner come down close to her outside the sixteenth-pole, battled with that rival to the finish and just missed. WHATLOVELOOKSLIKE
went to the front, showed the way on the inside through slow fractions, was asked under threat on the far turn, lost the lead while off the rail into the stretch
and was outfinished but willingly earned the show. NEW GINYA saved ground under restraint on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, went two then
three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, pursued the leader while outside in the drive and lacked the needed kick. OUT OF SIGHT broke
out at the start, went around the first turn in the three path, was reserved on the outside, traveled three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response. SARATOGA CHROME broke a bit slow, was reserved while saving ground at the rear, came under urging on the
final turn, turned into the stretch in the three path and failed to rally. FOLLOWING THE FINISH, THE RIDER OF SPUNGIE REQUESTED A HOLD ON THE
RACE. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

APOLLO TEN coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
