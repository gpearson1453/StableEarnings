Footnotes
DIFFERENT DRUM took command right from the start, was unchallenged down the backside, opened up at will throughout the turn, had a clear advantage
turning for home and cantered to the wire for an impressive victory. PENNYJET was unhurried co-trailing on the inside down the backstretch, began to pick
up runners saving ground on the rail three furlongs from home, rallied smartly on the fence through the stretch and got up at the wire for second.
GLENROSA tracked three wide outside rivals down the back straight, was ridden for more trying to go after the winner midway on the turn, chased in vain at
the top of the stretch and just lost the nod at the line for the place share. LADY BOO tracked on the rail in the beginning, was nudged inside chasing the
lone gone winner with five sixteenths to go, battled between rivals for second money down the stretch and faded late to be on the losing end of a three
horse photo for the runners up share. UNDER BUDGET settled in the third flight outside runners at the half, was coaxed to try to keep pace with inside rival
three furlongs from the prize, backed away on the turn, could see the field at the top of the stretch and showed some late interest passing tired runners in
the final furlong. NACHO GIRL stalked inside in the third flight down the backside, put in a brief run three wide midway on the turn, was involved at the top of
the lane four wide dueling for the runners up share and faltered in mid-stretch. STORMY OCEAN was away slowly trailing in the early going, caught up to
the field with five eighths to go co-trailing outside down the back straight, asked between runners midturn, offered little run and flattened out in the stretch.

CONFUSING broke sharply for the lead early, set the fractions while hounded outside down the backstretch, quickly put away the pace challenger midpoint
on the turn, had a clear advantage straightening out for the drive and cruised home for the convincing win. SNOOKERED advanced on the fence down the
backside to track the contesting duo at the half, improved inside at the quarter pole, chased the winner but to no avail at the top of the lane but stubbornly
dug in late to hold off rivals on each side to hold for the place share in the end. SOCIAL JUSTICE was void of early speed trailing down the backside, caught
up to the field on the rail at the half, was steadied mildly losing inside position three furlongs from home, regrouped to rally up the rail with a quarter mile to
run and finished up on the fence just missing getting up for second money. DAWSON SILVER stalked on the rail near the rear at the half, weaved between
horses two furlongs from the prize advancing on horses, battled gamely in the thick of things for a share in the three path at the top of the lane and was one
paced late for a minor role. COACH ABERNATHY stalked between runners in the two path with four furlongs remaining, was ridden for more at the five
sixteenths pole putting in a mild rally, lost its path four wide in upper stretch, looked for a clear seam having run at the eighth pole and could not. GUNGI
stalked near the rear three deep outside foes at the half, roused three furlongs to go, made little progress, shifted outside in the seven path in upper stretch
but could not get involved in the late stages. STUBBORN STREAK watched the top pair tracking between horses at the half, kept even with rivals when
urged through the turn, was in the mix for a share in the four path turning for home but yielded at the furlong marker. IGNITE THE STORM pressed the
issue outside down the back straight, gave way while trying to force the pace midway on the turn and retreated between runners in mid-stretch. TRIGGER'S
BAY tracked the contesting pair three deep down the backstretch, came under a ride three wide three furlongs from the wire, could not keep pace with
others and tired in upper stretch.

path and pulled clear. ANITA MARGARITA saved ground early, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the second bend in the
two path and chased the winner home from there. COURTLY RO raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, continued around the far
turn in the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. DELPHIA raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the pace
setter on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far bend from the three path, started a bid entering the stretch and weakened late. JUMPIN JUNIE
led the way while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the second turn and faded in the lane. SHE

Footnotes
PARTY prompted the pace outside down the back straight, continued to hound the frontrunner outside on the turn, fought outside bobbing heads for the
lead with the inside rival through the lane and prevailed by the nod at the wire. CHARLOTTES ROAD had a slim lead inside down the backstretch, appeared
to be getting out briefly nine sixteenths from the finish, maintained a slim advantage clinging to the lead on the turn, battled stubbornly on the fence to the
wire but lost the photo in a game effort at the finish. LOIS' COURAGE was brushed inside at the break, became eager fighting the rider when behind foes
five furlongs from home, settled shortly afterwards, tracking nicely on the rail throughout the turn, loomed a threat three wide straightening out for home,
determinedly chased the leaders through the stretch, could not make any headway late and settled for a clear third in the end. YOU BE THE JUDGE was
reined back tracing the top pair five furlongs out, continued to watch the front two with horses on either side in the two path around the bend, shifted out
mildly four wide at the top of the lane to be in range of the leaders but needed more late to pose a threat in the end. PEGGY broke in at the start, was under
a snug hold in mid-pack down the backstretch, tracked the co-leaders while running three wide between horses on the turn, shifted to the five path in with a
chance for a share turning for home but lacked a finish through the stretch run. SCORED stalked four wide down the backstretch, was part of the foursome
tracking the engaging pair on the turn, travelling four deep outside, angled out widest in the six path for the drive and levelled off in mid- stretch. BLITZ was
in tight quarters and was reined back between runners at the five eighths pole, trailed the compact field saving ground throughout the turn and had no run to
offer on the fence running to the finish line. STORMY DILEMMA broke out at the start, settled near the rear five deep down the backside, made little gain
running four to five wide outside horses on the turn and could not get into contention driving to the wire.

Footnotes
TAQUANYAH saved ground around the first turn, stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn,
challenged in upper stretch and dueled to the wire, edging clear late. THE NIIGON FACTOR saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the
backstretch and around the second bend and dueled through the stretch, giving way near the wire. LIAM'S GIFT hit the gate leaving it, raced off the pace on
the inside through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, and gained ground late.
SECRETARYOFTHENILE raced in the three path around the first bend, chased the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the
second turn in the two path and was outkicked in the lane. BIZYMALINE raced in the two path early, settled in the middle of the pack between horses up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and finished eveny. WICKED MERCURY raced in the three path around the firs turn, came up the
backstretch off the pace on the outside, continued around the far turn still in the three path and made no bid. ROSEBUD'S HOPE raced in the middle of the
pack on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the four path and faded from there. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN
trailed the field throughout and despite saving ground was never a factor.

Footnotes
LEGS LIKE FLATTER had a good position settling nicely on the rail in midfield through the backstretch, waited to move rating kindly behind the pacesetter
on the turn, shifted off the tiring leader in the two path in mid stretch, burst between horses to claim the lead with a sixteenth to run and gamely held off the
closing foe by a diminishing margin crossing the finish line. BRAQUET broke slowly to begin, improved smartly outside horses through the backside, waited
three wide for the que to go on the turn, made a bold move at the quarter pole to loom in the four path straightening out for the drive and put in a strong
determined run to the wire just missing at the finish. ECHO SEVEN emerged with the lead at the half mile marker, set the pace while hounded outside
throughout the turn, fought on gamely clinging to lead on the fence in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly late not switching leads to the finish. AZIEL
chased the pace in the two path with rivals on either side down the back straight, forced the issue outside of the frontrunner around the bend, was in the mix
three wide at the top of the lane, could not find more and stalled in the final furlong for a minor role. MRS. HOT SHOT hopped slightly at the start, was
steadied with runners on either side at the five furlong marker to trail through the backside, began to rally lengthening stride on the rail through the turn and
finished up with intent on the fence to the wire. HAYEK prompted three wide outside along the backstretch, travelled outside running tracking on the turn but
making little headway, could not keep up to rallying runners at the quarter pole and evened out in upper stretch. LITTLE TEDDY settled close to the back of
the pack on the inside at the half, was hard ridden five sixteenths from the finish making little progress through the turn and could not make any impression
running to the finish line. DESTINY RO stalked on the outside near the rear in the early going, could not match strides with others falling back on the turn
and showed little interest on the fence down the lane.

Footnotes
MASON'S GAMBLE had a good position on the rail watching the front three on the first turn, galloped on the fence under a comfortable stride watching the
top trio at the half mile marker, slipped up the fence with momentum midway on the far turn, shifted just outside off the tiring early leader at the quarter pole,
angled inwards, back to the rail with run at the furlong pole and gamely held off the late charge at the wire. CLEAR DESTINATION was allowed to settle in
the beginning near the back of the pack inside, continued to be unhurried seeing most of the field down the back straight, improved to take closer order to
the field at the half, was throttled down when just starting to run stuck behind horses, regrouped to swing five wide with a big run at the quarter pole and
closed in with each stride to the wire just missing at the finish. ROARING FORTIES travelled in midfield three deep into the first turn, rated kindly four wide
outside horses along the backstretch, rallied three wide around rivals with a sharp turn of foot three furlongs from the line, continued to pick up runners to
have a brief lead at the furlong pole, could not sustain the run, offered little resistance to the late closers in deep stretch but held on for a clear third with that
solid effort. TOWN CRUISE had a good position getting to the inside from an outside post tracking the front pair alone on the first turn, was content to sit off
the contesting duo along the backstretch, was nudged for more taking the lead at the quarter marker, was collared on each side in mid-stretch, could not
find another gear to fend off rivals and faded but held for a minor role crossing the wire. LUCKMAN broke out, bobbling at the start, trailed by many into the
first turn, was allowed to find his stride down the backside, began to reach for ground with momentum on the rail at the quarter pole, swung out to rally in the
seven path turning for home and closed willingly through the stretch passing many rivals in the last sixteenth. BANFF was forced out five wide entering the
first turn, travelled in the middle of the pack at the half, had to wait behind runners through the final turn, was shuffled back some and showed late interest to
finish up willingly in deep stretch. ARTIE stalked near the rear three wide on the first turn, made little progression outside foes along the back straight, put in
a mild run three wide from the back of the pack beginning at the three furlong pole, was in with a chance for a small share of the prize turning for home but
evened out in the final furlong. DUN DRUM tracked in the third flight on the outside at the half mile marker, could not quicken with others when the running
started midway on the final turn, was checked between horses at the quarter pole, losing position and made little impact in the three path down the lane.
TOLD IT ALL stalked near the rear into the first turn, took closer order to the leaders, position unchanged down the backstretch, waited inside behind horses
on the final turn, had clear run in the stretch drive but could not offer a finish to the wire. MALIBU EDGE took this field into the first turn leading on the rail,
dueled with an outside foe under brisk fractions down the backside, put away the early speed challenger with five sixteenths to run, could not find something
in reserve when collared by runners at the quarter pole and backed away on the fence with a furlong remaining. THE MINKSTER pressed the issue outside
in the first turn, battled in the two path setting a solid pace through the back straight, was the first one in the quick pace scenario to give way midway on the
far turn and retreated through the field at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SILENT TRIBUTE bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, recovered to lead the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and drew
off in the lane. GHOSTLY PERFECTION was squeezed back leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a
mile, navigated the turn from the two path, launched a bid approaching the eighth pole and gained ground late. MISS WATERLOO raced in the middle of the
pack on the outside through the early going, came around the turn in the two path, began a bid entering the stretch and improved position to the wire.
NEOLITHIC NATION chased the pace setters on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and kept on in the stretch. WAR VOW raced
off the pace on the inside through the early going, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and was outkicked in the lane. CRIMSON
NIGHTS hit the gate leaving it, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and finished
evenly. MOUNTAIN SOUND bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, causing his rider to lose a stirrup for a few strides before regaining it, settled
at the back of the pack through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the four path and made no bid. SNOW LAKE raced off the pace on the
outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and was not a threat. LOOK AT LIL SISTER trailed the field early, saved ground around
the bend and showed no kick. QUEEN SAHARA stalked the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and faded
in the lane. SEATTLE SIGNAL tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and tired in the stretch.
