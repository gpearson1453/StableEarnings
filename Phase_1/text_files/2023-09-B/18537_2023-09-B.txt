PLAY HARDER hesitated at the break spotting the field a few lengths, quickly recovered and moved up under some coaxing to be in range heading to the
half, tracked patiently then knifed his way between rivals nearing the lane, shifted in and bid along the rail to engage the dueling leaders heading to the
furlong marker, took command command soon after and edged away while kept to task. ALL THE WAY drifted in at the break and brushed with a rival,
corrected and stalked five wide outside rivals, took closer order four wide under coaxing past the five sixteenths, bid to engage the leader soon into the lane,
dueled three deep and on a slim lead in mid stretch, could not go with the winner near the sixteenth pole but stayed well to be second best. MINIMO flashed
speed then was rated back off the embattled leaders and settled in the clear, came under a ride and circled four wide making progress into the stretch,
shifted in while on his left lead in mid stretch, switched over to his correct lead and finished well along the rail. ONE WAY FARRIOR disputed the pace three
wide between runners early on, continued to contest the issue between runners past the three eighths, spurted clear near the quarter pole, fought on
between runners leaving the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly. ULTIMATE STRIKE , bumped and in tight at the break, was pushed along off the
inside, raced four wide between runners into the lane but came up empty in the final furlong. EYES ELEVEN , bumped at the break, saved ground into the
turn, came under asking soon after, angled out approaching the quarter pole, briefly waited in upper stretch, dropped back in some and churned on. DUBAI
FIRE broke inward and bumped with a rival, rushed up soon after and disputed the pace inside foes, stayed on to about mid stretch then gave way.
SIMON'S CHOICE , off the pace between foes, circled four to five wide into the lane but lacked a bid. ARMED AND READY lacked speed inside, angled
seven wide for the drive and failed to threaten. TORTOLA lagged back off the inside, angled seven to eight wide in upper stretch but failed to menace. RYE
DIGGITYDOG , bumped at the break, was sent up four wide between runners, forced the issue between foes mid turn then gave way in upper stretch.
RETURN FIRE had speed between foes, rated back off foes, saved ground pursuing then tired past the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
WHATSYOURBIGIDEA was off a bit slow after being bumped from both sides, regrouped and edged up three wide into the turn, tracked a four pronged
battle leaving the three eighths, steadied and was forced out a bit past the five sixteenths, recovered and responded when straightened, closed
determinedly four wide under left handed asks, moved to command outside BONDIVA near the sixteenth marker, eagerly cleared then was taken in hand
four about the final fifty yards. BONDIVA , bumped at the start, moved up within herself and joined the leaders four deep past the half, attended the pace in
hand, moved clear leaving the five sixteenths, widened a bit under asking in upper stretch, was guided outward bracing for the winner's challenge in mid
stretch, ceded to that one with about a sixteenth remaining but stayed on well. QUIT QUAY dropped off the early pace, raced three wide mid turn, shifted
five wide for the drive and had belated interest. TEA ROSE sped to command inside foes and set a pressured early pace, dueled inside a trio past the three
eighths, stayed on with effort past mid stretch then faded. QUEEN JELLY BEAN had speed and disputed the pace two wide between runners, was under
asking trying to keep pace past the five sixteenths, kept on with decent energy to about mid stretch then weakened. INTEL AGENT tracked the leading
quartet while saving ground, lacked room near the three sixteenths, eased out soon after, chased and faded. CHAMPLAIN'S DREAM vied three wide
between foes, steadied when in tight leaving the five sixteenths and gave way. STORM CREED drifted in at the break, bumped the winner then failed to
make an impact.

SEVEN'S ELEVEN , three deep chasing the pace for a half mile, secured command leaving the turn, steadily pulled away and was under brisk urging in mid
stretch. ORDER OFTHE KETTLE lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, had a mild move along the rail to mid stretch and failed to sustain the bid.
FEELING WOOZY trailed to the turn, was three deep mid way on the bend, moved to the inner rail turning for home and passed tired horses. FREEZE THE
FIRE hugged the inner rail chasing the pace to the stretch then weakened. CROSSLAND , three deep on the turn, was not a factor. FRIAR TUCK chased
the pace down the backstretch, failed to rally and swung wide entering the stretch. ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE sped to the early lead, set the pace in the two
path for a half mile, faltered and was eased.

FULL PROOF sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, was under a hustling ride entering the lane, edged away a bit in mid stretch, kept on under
strong encouragement through the final sixteenth and held firm. CORINGA broke outward and bumped with a rival, straightened and edged up to the inside
of TOCAYO leaving the five eighths, eased out early turn and stalked the winner, was put to serious urging past the five sixteenths, gave game chase from
the head of the lane and steadily cut back into the margin through the final seventy yards. UNDER THE OVERPASS drifted in at the break, corrected and
raced in range, was put to a hustling ride leaving the three eighths as the leaders got away a bit, saved ground into and through the lane and finished with
interest. TOCAYO bore out at the break, stalked three wide outside CORINGA, circled a bit wider into the lane, lacked a punch past mid stretch and faded.
IN THE DANCE , forced out a bit at the break, raced three deep pursuing past the three eighths, remained off the inside into the lane but lacked a serious
finish. BOMB CYCLONE , off a bit slow after hopping at the break, edged up some while between rivals near the three eighths, chased to the quarter pole
then retreated in the drive. MY LUCKY ACE , off last when hesitating, ducked in soon after, lagged back, angled four wide approaching the stretch but failed
to make headway. NANCY MADE MY DAY , bumped at the break, steadied when in close soon after, saved ground advancing to the half, failed to keep
pace leaving the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
PERFECTLY WICKED edged up early and tracked three wide, responded when given her cue past the three eighths, bid to engage to leader into the lane,
secured command under left handed asks near mid stretch then kicked away under a steady hand ride the final seventy yards. HIDDEN PRESENCE took
over leaving the chute and set a rated pace two wide, handled some outside pressure before clearing into the turn, dug in when confronted in upper stretch,
battled past mid stretch, held well and was well clear of the rest. VIENNESE WALTZ angled in near the five eighths and moved up a bit around the far turn,
angled back out while put to pressure, circled five wide into the stretch but failed to generate a serious run. LISA'S PALACE stalked the early pace while
removed from the rail, was put to a hard ride mid turn, angled four wide pursuing into the stretch, failed to go on near mid stretch and faded. THURSDAY
GIRL prompted the early pace to the inside of HIDDEN PRESENCE, saw that one get away a bit into the turn, stayed around and chased under a ride past
the three eighths, lacked a response leaving the three sixteenths and gave way. SUPER SNEAKY rated off foes early on, shifted in around the turn and
retreated. CUNDI broke inward then was outrun.

KING'S RIVER , bumped at the break, quickly recovered and accelerated to the inside of foes to put a head in front after a furlong, set a rated pace while
handling some outside pressure, turned away a threat from KINGDOM FORCE nearing the quarter pole, kicked away when put to some urging in upper
stretch, was kept alert with a left handed ask near mid stretch then eagerly pulled away while racing a bit erratically under a hand ride. KINGDOM FORCE
came in at the break causing a bit of a jam up, corrected and moved up to stalk the pace, took aim three wide past the five sixteenths, briefly threatened the
winner, gave hard chase to mid stretch, faded late but managed to save the place. THENAME OF THEGAME rated off the pace, came four wide for the
drive, drifted in and finished with interest. WHISKEYINTHEJARO flashed speed then drafted back a bit off the leaders, was under a ride leaving the three
eighths, gave hard chase racing between runners mid turn, angled three wide into the lane then worked between runners past the three sixteenths, dropped
in towards the rail for the final furlong then steadied with run when encountering traffic through the final yards. DASHING D'ARTAGNAN , three deep leaving
the three eighths, lacked a solid response. GALLANT RULER , off the pace while saving some ground, raced under rating into the lane, drifted in near mid
stretch and came up empty. DIALED IN A PANIC , bumped at the break, saved ground chasing the pace and weakened. VOLPE , off slowly when hopping,
was bumping soon after, rushed up between foes and disputed the pace outside the winner, failed to kick on entering the lane and faltered through the final
three sixteenths.
