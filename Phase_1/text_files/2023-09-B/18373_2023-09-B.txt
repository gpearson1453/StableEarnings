CUBE BABY , bumped by HAPPY CLOUDS leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail throughout and rallied. HAPPY CLOUDS bumped ICE CUBE
BABY when bearing out at the break, raced in the two path chasing the winner around the turn and weakened the final furlong. WHEELINGNDEALING , a
forward factor between horses around the turn, gave way. JOYA DEL SUR circled the turn three wide, floated to the four path entering the stretch and
faltered. SEA ART , outrun, raced on her left lead in the stretch.

Footnotes
PROPER STORM , unhurried early while saving ground, edged up behind rivals while patiently handled past the five sixteenths, worked outward and
straightened to be seven to eight wide in upper stretch, surged outside rivals under strong handling, took over leaving the sixteenth pole, kicked away and
was geared down very late. HAZELMOOR BEACH , floated four wide into the first turn, edged up between rivals leaving the three eighths then had to wait,
shifted out four to five wide in upper stretch, advanced between runners nearing the sixteenth pole to challenge, kept on willingly but was second best.
LADY MOSLER grabbed command early, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure past the five eighths, shook clear in upper stretch, was challenged
again in mid stretch, clung to the advantage to about the sixteenth pole then faded. NUWANDA , rank early on, saved ground advancing around the final
turn, eased out for the drive, chased and flattened out. SINGALONG settled off the pace, saved ground into the lane, made progress past mid stretch then
failed to seriously sustain. SUPERSNAKE forced the pace outside LADY MOSLER, kept on past mid stretch then weakened. DIVINE WINE , between foes
in mid pack, steadied entering the far turn, angled three wide for the drive, moved up then was blocked in mid stretch. BELIEVE IN FREEDOM , well placed
stalking the embattled leaders, angled four wide under a ride into the lane, failed to go on leaving mid stretch and weakened. SORTARIA , three deep early,
was not a factor. LOTTACLASS LILSASS was outrun.

Footnotes
GOOD KNIGHT NILE , bumped at the break, rated kindly while saving ground in mid pack, eased out and around a tiring rival leaving the far turn, dropped
back in, steadily gained towards the rail leaving mid stretch, altered off heels, split rivals, took command late and drove clear. SUMMER ANTHEM , away to
an early lead, ceded past the wire then rated close up and towards the inside, moved between foes then back to the rail leaving the far turn, bid inside rivals
past the five sixteenths, struck the top soon into the lane, spurted clear under left handed asks, kept on past the sixteenth marker, could not contain the
winner late and gave way grudgingly. SIGMUND pulled his way forward around the first turn then rated close up behind foes past the five eighths, saved
ground in hand leaving the five sixteenths, swung out four wide for the drive, kept on willingly and earned the show. CELTIC SEA prompted the pace three
wide, moved between rivals to poke a head in front after a half, sparred between runners nearing the lane, ceded command in upper stretch, stayed on to
pursue past mid stretch and kept trying to the wire. LIGHTNING LAD , towards the inside, was urged along to the inside of a foe leaving the far turn, shifted
three wide but failed to seriously kick on. BALLYHOO PRINCE , three to four wide in range, was under pressure chasing the leading trio past the five
sixteenths, dropped in for the drive and faded. AWESOME STRIKE , three to four wide while off the pace, swung six wide in upper stretch but lacked a bid.
MENTALIST , inside early, came off the rail near the far turn, angled seven wide for the drive and came up empty. JONES FALLS , acting up as the gates
sprung, was off last and failed to recover. NEUTRAL rated off the rail, moved up four wide past the five eighths, bid outside foes soon after, sparred to the
quarter pole then gave way. SPIRITUAL GHOST was outrun. FAST RIDE , bumped and stumbled soon after the start, recovered and sped clear, set the
pace towards the rail, could not contain rivals nearing the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
MASHUA took over between foes early on, drifted out a bit nearing the three eighths, dropped in and corrected, repelled an outside challenge from
CHALICE near the quarter pole, spurted away under a drive leaving the three sixteenths, kept on under pressure and prevailed. INTEL AGENT , well back
early, swung very wide for the drive, bumped with GANBATTE when advancing inside the furlong grounds, righted and finished well outside foes to nab the
place. CHALICE tracked three to four wide early on, was floated out about a path leaving the furlong marker, bid outside the winner past the five sixteenths,
stayed on as that one got away nearing mid stretch, found more inside the sixteenth marker and fought on between foes. BIZZY BIZZY rated close between
foes early, edged up outside a rival nearing the quarter pole, shifted out and kept on trying. GANBATTE , taken to rate off the pace three to four wide, eased
out in upper stretch, drifted out and bumped with an outer foe when advancing past mid stretch, corrected and continued on with interest. RITAMARLEY ,
fidgety when the gates opened, hopped at the break, made a good inside move into the turn, steadied briefly, angled out in the drive and churned on
between. TIPSY TOURIST rated four wide around the turn, angled in some and had belated action behind foes. IRISH MIRAGE saved ground, was lightly
shuffled nearing the three eighths, eased out, edged up between runners then lacked a solid finish. LOVE NOTION had speed between rivals then eased
back a bit, chased to the inside of a rival past the five sixteenths and faded. SNOOZE BUTTON failed to menace. I'M PRETTY , four to five wide chasing,
weakened in the drive. SUPER JO JO flashed speed inside, failed to keep pace leaving the three eighths and retreated. An objection by the rider of
CHALICE against the winner for alleged interference into and around the turn was not allowed.

NORTH HIGHLAND , close up off the duel, raced three wide on the turn, advanced outside foes to take the lead inside the eighth pole, was under rousing
and edged away. BY ITS ABSENCE , bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail through the
stretch and rallied. BILL OF RIGHTS bumped BY ITS ABSENCE when bearing out at the break, circled the turn three to four wide and rallied outside
horses. ONE AMERICA hugged the inner rail, dueled around the turn, angled out a bit in mid stretch and gave way in the drive. LONG LIVE NOW , outrun,
swung to the five path turning for home. FREESTANDING dueled outside ONE AMERICA and gave way the final furlong. LABARDE , between horses on
the turn, was not a factor. VICTIM OF THE NITE unseated his rider when very rank leaving the starting gate. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the
start but no action was taken.

HOPE OVER FEAR , taken in hand soon after the break while saving ground, edged up through the backstretch run, had her rider sit chilly to the inside of
foes past the five sixteenths, moved through along the rail and was hand ridden to the lead past the three sixteenths, cleared soon after, kept on under right
handed asks inside the sixteenth pole and dug in tenaciously to fend off NICOLAR. NICOLAR , between foes mid way on the first turn, settled outside a rival
through the backstretch run, advanced three wide nearing the quarter pole, swung six wide into the lane, ranged up outside rivals to loom a serious threat in
mid stretch, kept on gamely was denied. RED WIND , a bit keen off the rail around the first turn, steadied along and checked while dealing with traffic soon
into the backstretch to the far turn, waited past the five sixteenths, saved ground into the lane, eased out and finished with interest to earn the show. DIVINE
EXCHANGE settled off the pace while saving ground, angled five wide for the drive and closed steadily. BRAMBLE BUSH broke outward, corrected and lost
ground four to five wide, gained past the five eighths, bid outside foes mid way on the final turn, stayed on to pursue past mid stretch then faded late.
CONGRESS HALL stalked three wide, was under pressure while caught between runners from the half to the quarter pole and weakened. INSTINCTIVE ,
three to four wide, edged up between runners nearing the half, forced the issue into the lane then weakened. TRIKKI NIKKI cleared early, set the pace off
the inside, was hooked from both sides soon into the lane and surrendered past the three sixteenths.

Footnotes
QUICK MUNNY sprinted to the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, responded when put to the whip inside the eighth pole
and was kept to her business late. BAZINGA C , well placed inside horses around the turn, was under urging approaching the stretch, raced in the two path
through the lane and rallied. RACHEL'S ROCK , three deep chasing the winner around the turn, remained on her left lead in the stretch and flattened out.
ROYAL WHISPER , steadied when bearing out at the start, steadied in tight quarters along the inner rail entering the turn, moved out into the stretch,
worked between horses and rallied. VIOLENT VIXEN , steadied in traffic leaving the backstretch, hugged the inner rail in the stretch, had a mild move to the
eighth pole and failed to sustain the run. OUT DANCING dwelt at the break, swung to the seven path in upper stretch and showed some late interest. DRY
WELL , well off the rail on the turn, was outrun. WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER , never a factor, swung to the six path in upper stretch. AMERICAN BASTET ,
inside horses chasing the pace down the backstretch, raced along the inner rail in the stretch and weakened. CRYPTO MAMA , well placed outside horses
into the turn, was four deep entering the stretch and gave way. BANDITS WARRIOR prompted the pace outside the winner and gave way.

Footnotes
HAY CHIEF , unhurried early while saving ground, came out for the run around the second turn, edged up behind rivals past the three sixteenths, dove
towards the rail leaving mid stretch, closed sharply under a solid ride to take over inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear. PIETRELCINA , between rivals,
pushed along past the five sixteenths, altered out wide for the drive and rallied outside rivals. BOLD HOPPERTUNITY cleared early and set a rated pace,
took some pressure near the five sixteenths, spurted away under a drive in mid stretch, was collared near the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly.
LONGWORTH saved ground under early rating, angled out and worked between runners near the three eighths, dropped back in to pursue, eased out in
the drive and closed between runners. WIRED IN broke awkwardly, raced between rivals early, gained four wide outside rivals past the five sixteenths, gave
chase leaving mid stretch then was out finished. BAD LINEAGE , off the pace and three wide leaving the half, worked outward through the final furlong and
rallied. CRIPPLE CREEK , three wide stalking the pace, moved to threaten around the final turn, failed to quicken with the leader soon into the lane, gave
hard chase past mid stretch and faded. ELFUEGOMASBRILANTE , off the pace, swung wide for the drive and failed to menace. HERE'S LIAM lost ground
four wide, advanced to a tracking spot near the half, gave hard pursuit into the land and weakened. HARNESS CREEK lost ground four to five wide and
came up empty. SCORESTOSETTLE saved ground stalking the pace, remained a presence to the far turn then faltered.
