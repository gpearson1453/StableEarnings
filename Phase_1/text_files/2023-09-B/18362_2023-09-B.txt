Footnotes
BEAUGATTI went three-wide into the opening turn, moved up to contest the early pace, overtook the lead leaving the backstretch, opened up through the
final turn, and was geared down. AMEER gave chase inside, was no match for the winner, and finished clearly second-best. BORN ON FIRE trailed early
and bid belatedly. CHESTER SLEW stalked three to four wide into the opening turn, chased leaving the backstretch, and tired. CAROSWAY set the pace
from a rail position, was unable to move on with the eventual winner, and stopped.

Footnotes
FOUR O SIX CREED vied for the early lead, dueled outside of SHURAZ through the backstretch, responded to a challenge from KAUAI DAN in the final
turn, and drew clear under light handling. KAUAI DAN was under a strong hold leaving the first turn, cruised up into the three path to press the pace, and
gained a slim advantage over FOUR O SIX CREED, but couldn't muster the needed rally in the stretch. CALI CONQUEST trailed while wide leaving the
opening turn, gained closer order nearing the quarter pole, and closed late for show. HANDSOME HENRY tracked the pacesetters, lodged a bid into the
stretch, and was edged out. H K MELODY attended the early pace while three to four wide, and lacked a closing response. SHURAZ was quickest to the
turn, contended the pace from the rail, was unable to keep pace with the field, and stopped.

Footnotes
MOHAYMEN DAY dueled inside of NIGHT FLYER for the early lead, continued to match strides into the far turn, disposed of rival then moved clear and
held safely. VALUE DANCER rated well off the pace, gained closer order leaving the backstretch, waited in traffic inside then shifted outside, angled down
to the rail into the stretch was gaining late but needed more ground. VIVIEN'S CHARM chased three-wide through the backstretch, and closed well late.
NIGHT FLYER vied two wide into the opening turn, contested the pace outside of MOHAYMEN DAY, was unable to carry on with rival nearing the stretch,
and gave way. SWIFT SWALLOW sent for speed, chased inside, and lacked a kick. SAVYSKYE fanned four-wide leaving the opening turn, and faded.
SECRET HAVEN fanned three wide in the first turn, and tired.

Footnotes
NO MORE JO KING raced four wide leaving the opening turn, advanced quickly leaving the backstretch, swung four wide at the head of the lane, and got
up just in time. MISS MCBRIDE vied between for the early lead, pressured BUNNY NOREEN through the backstretch, gained a short lead then responded
to the challenge from WOMANONTHEWARPATH, and was nipped at the wire. WOMANONTHEWARPATH stalked three wide early, sat in range in the
backstretch, moved up menacingly nearing the stretch but lacked the rally needed. MONOPOLIZE gained closer order leaving the backstretch, and lacked a
late kick that was needed. QUEEN RHONDA lacked a serious bid. RECIO'S SKYE offered little. BUNNY NOREEN set a pressured early pace, was
overtaken, and faded steadily.

Footnotes
ISLE OF SKYE quickly went to the front to set the pace, took pressure into the far turn, and drew away into the stretch. BOOTIFUL ROSE sat just off the
pace while three to four wide, moved up menacingly but was unable to stall the winner and battled through the stretch to just hold the place finish.
TACOFLAVOREDKISSES fanned five wide into the first turn, tracked outside, came under urging into the lane, rallied determinedly, and lost the bob. HARD
TO COME HOME raced in traffic into the opening turn, sat in range from the two path, and failed to threaten in the drive. PRESS GANG was jostled in traffic
in the first turn, and chased outside to no avail. AWHITESPORTSCOAT was in tight in the first turn then checked, and lacked a bid. SHARP DRESSED
BEAU saved to no avail. MANFORALLSEASONS trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BIG AL'S VISION vied inside for the early lead, showed the way through the backstretch while saving ground, and held safely under intermittent handling.
PERDITION stalked three wide into the backstretch, chased into the far turn but was unable to stall the winner and held late. EXAMINER unhurried inside,
roused at the quarter pole then angled out to the two path, and edged clear for show honors. DAD'S LEGACY sat midpack in the four path, lodged a bid into
the final turn, and was out finished for show. JUMEIRAH COAST fanned three wide into the first turn, bid outside and came up empty in drive. DUNE
D'ORO chased the pace in the two path, and faded gradually inside. TAPIT TO THE WIRE lacked early speed and failed to threaten. LITTLE CHICAGO
lacked a bid.

Footnotes
LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR tracked four to five wide early, overtook the lead into the stretch and won going away. SMASH FACTOR vied inside then
pressed the early pace from just off the rail, was overtaken entering the stretch and lacked the rally needed. MCKENZIE RED tracked the early pacesetters,
lacked running room nearing the final turn, and finished evenly. WYE CROSS raced from the back of the field, angled out sharply into the stretch and closed
late. CARSON'S LEGACY chased outside and was outkicked through stretch. GIVE EM HECK BECK unhurried early, chased into the far turn, and
weakened in the stretch. YORKTOWN was outsprinted to the turn, chased four wide in the backstretch, and retreated in the stretch. REDNECK REMARK
sent hard for speed outside, set the pace while four wide, and had nothing left in reserve late.
