Footnotes
OUTSLEWTHEM was sent to the front at the outset and set the early pace while well clear, hugged the rail into the lane, remained clear down the lane and
held safely in the final stages. PROTEST was a tad slow at the break, chased the pace early on, raced off the rail into the lane, was gaining down the lane
and held place in the final stages. JAHEZ was a tad slow at the start, trailed the field early on, raced in the three path into the lane, rallied in the stretch and
was gaining on the place in the late stages. FORT STROOPE stalked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run.
ISLAND CURRENCY ran off in the pre-load while being hard to load, was steadied back while between horses along the turn and empty down the lane.

Footnotes
WHISKEY DIAMOND set the pace, opened up a clear advantage, raced off the rail into the lane, remained clear down the lane and held safely in the late
stages. KATNAPPING broke slowly from the gate, chased the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane and moved up down the lane while no
match for the winner late. SKI SLOPE stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. AADYA was a bit
slow at the start, raced in the five path into the lane and improved position down the lane. ARAYA was never a factor. CRYSTAL M was never a threat.

NORTHERN DIAMOND was bothered at the start, tracked the pace early, made a bid three wide nearing the lane, raced in the five path entering the lane,
was under a long drive down the lane and edged clear in the final stages. CALTHA stalked the pace early, took over, was in the three path into the lane,
under a long drive down the lane and gave in during the late stages. BUCKEYE BLING raced back early on, was off the rail into the lane under a rally, made
a bid in the stretch from the inside but did not have enough for place in the final stages. ABITIBI came out and bumped rivals at the start, chased the pace,
was in the six path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but leveled off late in the drive. PRINCESSTAPITURE tracked the pace early, made a bid from
between horses nearing the lane, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the drive. I'M LEGIT was bumped and bothered at the start, trailed
the field early on, raced in the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. ABIGAIL LEE was never a factor. BLEST LIFE was a tad slow at the
start then was rushed up and eventually spent.
