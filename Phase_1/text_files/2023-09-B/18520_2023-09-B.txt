Footnotes
BELLE'S BLUE BELL stalked the early pace, made a four wide bid leaving the five sixteenths, took over off the turn and drew off the final furlong after one
pop left handed with the crop, then drew off while being ridden out. TIZ RACE DAY vied for the early lead on the outside, made a three wide bid on the turn
to take command, then was headed by the winner off the turn, proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second best. CHA CHA CHUKKA chased
the pace four wide, came five wide into the lane and had no rally, bested rest. TRENDY was reserved early, three wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch
and improved position on the outside. BELLY DANCE chased the pace on the inside, swung out three wide leaving the turn but came up empty in the drive.
HOPESNDREAMS vied for the lead on the inside and weakened. MIDCENTURY MODERN was settled early on the inside on the turn and failed to
menace. STREETCORNER vied for the lead in between rivals and gave way. MITI FAST FLOWER raced on the inside and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CARROLL GIRL was well rated three wide, made a four wide move by the quarter pole, then was given one right handed pop and then one left handed to
go on even terms for command, then one right handed to gain a short lead, then maintained the short lead to the wire while being ridden confidently,
something left. HASHTAG LUCKY set the pace while racing off the rail, three wide on the turn, then was outfinished by the winner while staying on gamely
to the wire. BIG CHEEKS was reserved early, shifted out and advanced four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and rallied. RUN DEVIL chased
the pace on the inside but lacked the needed rally. ANONYMOUSLY was well placed on the inside, made a bid on the turn to vie for command but
weakened in the drive. THE HAUNTED ROOM was five wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four wide and tired on the turn.

Footnotes
BODONTKNOW vied for the early lead two wide, then rated off the pace on the backstretch, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, then went on even
terms off the turn and lugged in by the furlong marker, then prevailed late to prove best, did not return to winners circle and was ponied off, returned lame.
RUTHENIAN was five wide into the first turn, vied for the lead on the outside, then made a three to four wide bid on the turn to shake clear, then was
headed leaving the turn by the winner, then was forced to the inside by the winner in the lane, fought gamely to the wire but out-kicked. LAWLESSNESS
was reserved early, advanced three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and had a late rally to gain the show award. STREET LAMP was
allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn, checked by the quarter pole, then angled off the inside and had a belated rally. STARSHIP GOTHAM was
void of early speed and passed the tiring rivals. PAPA JIMMY was well rated on the inside and weakened. MR BOLDACIOUS was settled back early and
lackd a serious rally. ASSERT DOMINANCE was four wide into the first turn, then vied for the lead four wide and in between rivals, then weakened the final
quarter of a mile. IM YOUR PAPI vied for the early lead three wide and in between rivals and tired. GABBYS BIG NOTION failed to menace.

Footnotes
INTREPID DAYDREAM pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command, then gained a short lead nearing the furlong
marker, tried to lug in slightly in the furlong grounds but was corrected and drew clear to prove best, driving. LATE FROST broke sharply and set a
pressured pace early on the inside, then dueled with the winner on the turn, fought gamely and then angled off the inside by the sixteenth pole but could not
match strides with the winner while clearly second best. TAPPIN JOSIE was off slowly, chased the pace on the inside, angled out leaving the turn and
finished willingly to best the rest. JUROR NUMBER FOUR tracked the pace in between rivals, came three wide into the lane and weakened in the drive.
STREET LUTE stalked the early pace and made a mild bid four wide on the turn but then was empty. MIA TOSCA was settled early, three wide on the turn
and had no response. BOUND BY DESTINY was off a step slow, saved ground on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
NO SABE NADA was rated four wide early, made a three wide bid on the turn to press the pace leaving the quarter pole, then had a long drive and was
trying to lug in on the left lead and got up to win the bob on the wire. REBEL EMPIRE was away alertly to set a pressured pace towards the inside, then had
a long drive and dug in gamely but lost the head bob to just miss. GOLDEN CANDY was well placed on the inside, made a bid on the inside but needed
more. GOING TO THE LEAD pressed the early pace three wide, then was shuffled and rated back on the turn, angled out in the lane and ran on to the wire.
RUN POPPY tracked the early pace in between rivals, then steadied nearing the three eighths marker, two wide by the quarter pole and had a belated rally.
PICTURE THIS chased the early pace five wide, then dropped down to be three wide on the turn, then finished willingly late. TAKE CHARGE TOO was
reserved early two wide, swung out four wide leaving the turn and had some late foot. TAPPIN CAT chased the early pace four wide and weakened. APRIL
FOOLS ANDY was settled back early and lacked a solid rally. ZABRACADABRA was settled three wide and was in between rivals on the turn and in traffic
and had no response. THE COLORA KID was settled on the inside and weakened. CITI CREEK failed to menace.

Footnotes
SUNDOG was well placed early on the inside, eased out by the five sixteenths and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, took over off the turn and
drew off to prove much the best under mild crop urging. THROWBACK tracked the paced three wide, came four wide into the lane and finished willingly
under hand urging to be clearly second best. WIN OR CELLAR was reserved early, saved ground on the turn, cut the corner leaving the turn and was up for
the show award. GRAND SPUN was reserved early, three wide on the turn, angled out in the lane and improved position missing the show award. MIGHTY
GIN GIN set the pace while clear in the two path, then was headed leaving the turn and weakened. HONEYCAMP chased the pace five wide and came six
wide into the lane and weakened. PUSH chased the pace four wide early, three wide by the quarter pole and weakened. JIMMYDABOOK failed to menace.
EMILIA'S LEGACY (PER) was settled early and weakened.
