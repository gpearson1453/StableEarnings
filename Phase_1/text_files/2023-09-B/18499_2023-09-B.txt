TEXAS DANA set the pace drawing out to upper stretch adding on there as much the best. QUITCHERSNIVELIN a step slow early came five wide in upper
stretch rallying late four deep to save place. FREEDOM'S ALLURE saved ground to upper stretch extending in a place duel along the inside. SPUNKY
ZOEY chased the pace vying between horses down the lane staying on to the end. BAY OF ANGELS unruly was steadied at the start, angled inside to
upper stretch showing late interest from the rail. MAYSVILLE MISS slow early played no factor. RHYTHM FOREVER sent hard pursuit all out to upper
stretch wearing out there. CONNECT IT was always outrun.

evenly. I'M A LAWMAN pressed the pace through the turn weakening between horses late. GRAB THE MUNNY faded on the turn. BALISTICO in close
