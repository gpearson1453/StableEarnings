Footnotes
FESSY pressured on the early lead to set the pace, opened a clear advantage in the turn and drew off down the lane despite drifting out to the ten path.
POP CHART stalked the pacesetter from the rail through the turn, was set to a drive midway on the bend and ground her way up for the place. PRETTY
VEGAS pressed the pace to midway on the turn and weakened coming home. SKINDY DIPPER reserved well off the pace to the top of the lane and made
a late bid to hit the board. GREEN CHILE tracked the leaders from four wide through the turn and failed to mount a closing bid. RUBY GIRL chased the
pace from wide down the backside and failed to respond. POISED PRINCESS broke a step slow to be at the rear, lacked early foot and showed some late
interest in the lane. SWEET ENCHANTMENT was never a factor.

Footnotes
BAD BOY GEIST stalked the pace to the turn, mounted a three wide rally to engage the leaders in mid-stretch and wore them down late in a determined
drive. BOLSHIE sped to the lead shortly away from the gate, responded when challenged on the turn and in mid-stretch, fought on bravely but could not
hold off the winner. BINGE pressed the early pace from the rail early on, was taken in hand to tip out to the two path to engage the winner on the turn and
weakened late in the lane. SECRETO DE AMORE reserved off the pace for the first half mile and showed some late interest down the lane.
BRENTSPENCE stumbled to his knees leaving the gate, was gathered up to be the distant early trailer and finished evenly without a chance after the start.
INDIGO RICH showed some early speed chasing the pacesetter and gave way turning for home.

Footnotes
LIGEIA stalked the pace to the far turn, ranged up three wide to engage the leader at the quarter pole, battled with that one to midway down the lane, put
away the pacesetter and responded to the challenge of the closer, dueling to the wire and prevailed by a short nose in a game effort. DAWN reserved off the
early pace, circled up four wide turning for home, caught the leaders in mid-stretch and dueled to the wire only to be denied in a good try. CINDERELLA
STORY prompted the pace down the backside, assumed command into the turn, was put to a drive nearing the quarter pole and fought to midway down the
lane and gave way late. MORNING ANGEL unhurried early on, circled five wide through the turn to loom up at the head of the lane and flattened out in the
drive. SPLIT DECISION raced prominently for the first half mile and faded. HALO OF FIRE trailed most of the way and was never a threat. GOTTA B
KITTEN ME hustled up to make the lead into the first turn from the outside post, led for a half and came up empty.

Footnotes
RAFAELLA stalked the leader to the turn, took command while still in hand two wide nearing the quarter pole, quickly opened a wide advantage and was
kept to task through the lane as much the best. LOTTA LATTE tracked the pace through the turn from two wide and finished willingly to gain the place.
TOUCHDOWN PASS unhurried early on, made a steady advance and found her best stride late to be gaining on the runner-up. EYE SHADOW broke
alertly and sped off to a clear lead, could not respond when challenged on the turn and weakened down the lane. JELLO BEAN tracked the pace through
the turn and lacked a rally. ROSAS FOR LUZ went one-paced as no threat. SAME O SAME O trailed most of the way as a non-factor. EURCOOL showed
some early foot for a quarter mile and gave way.

Footnotes
MISS QUEST prompted the pace for the first half mile, assumed command into the far turn, opened a clear advantage and held well through the lane.
SKYVIEW DRIVE slow early to near the back entering the far turn, commenced a four wide rally turning for home and was gaining through the lane.
EASTERN MARKET stalked the pace to the turn, mounted a threatening bid at the quarter pole and was out-finished in the stretch. STARLIT SOFI was
rated off the pace entering the backside, rallied to be prominent in the far turn and flattened out. GIRL GOODBYE reserved off the pace down the backside
and failed to respond when called upon. VIVID EXPOSURE set the pace for a half mile and came up empty. YANIRA hopped at the start to be at the rear of
the field and was never a factor.

Footnotes
JUST HANGIN ON rated off the pace for the first quarter mile, rallied up the fence in the turn, tipped out down the lane and prevailed driving. UP THE
ODDS unhurried early to be well off the leaders in the turn, rallied four wide in upper stretch, angled to the rail down the lane and was gaining late.
WATCHER sprinted clear of the field shortly away from the gate, opened a clear lead to the top of the lane and weakened late in the drive. CHANNAH DEL
MAR tracked the pace through the turn and made a mild bid from five wide in the lane. FORCE LUCKY chased the pacesetter to the quarter pole while
under an early drive and flattened out down the stretch. LILAH B tracked the pace from the rail down the backside and steadily faded. LUCY THE GOOSE
trailed most of the trip as a non-factor. MORNING REFLECTION was never a threat.

VERSATILE stalked the pace from the fence to the far turn, swung out three wide nearing the quarter pole to take command at the head of the lane and
pulled clear down the stretch. TOPF ROAD RULES reserved off the pace in mid-pack, angled out for the stretch drive and found his best stride late to be
gaining at the wire. TOO BAD JUSTICE set a well rated pace to the head of the lane, responded when challenged in upper stretch but was outkicked late in
the drive. JERICHO EXPRESS pressed the pace throughout, responded when called upon turning for home but failed to get passed the pacesetter. J'S
NAUGHTY BOY reserved off the pace racing five wide and failed to mount a rally. CELERITY well placed along the rail into the far turn and lacked a
response when called upon. KING SOCIAL never menaced. INHERENT POWERS raced between horses into the backstretch, was taken up when
squeezed at the five-eighths pole and continued as no threat. HOUSED was outrun.

Footnotes
FLYING SAMURAI pressed the pace from between rivals through the far turn, responded when called upon leaving the quarter pole and kicked clear in
upper stretch. BOOGIE BODE made an early bid from between horses down the backstretch to duel on the lead, lost position at the quarter pole and came
again gamely to be second best. VINTAGE VINYL reserved for the first half mile rallied into the turn to loom up and weakened coming home. BATUKHAN
(IRE) caught wide into the first turn, made a bold middle move to engage the leaders from three wide into the far turn and flattened out coming home.
OFFSHORE TITHE was the distant trailer to the far turn and passed weaker rivals late. CHARLIE WHISKEY was never a factor. PERJURY showed brief
speed for a half mile and came up empty.
