Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE GWEN unhurried early, took closer order nearing the far turn, fanned four wide in the last turn, and prevailed after a multi-horse scramble to
the wire. BABS DELIGHT chased from the rail, angled out at the top of the stretch bumping into PRANCE and rallied from the rail and just missed. THRILL
OF THE NITE broke sharply then set a pressured pace, was unable to move on with NO BAKK TALK into the far turn, angled in when roused at the head of
the lane then bumped into an inside foe, and was bested. NO BAKK TALK pressed the early pace, inherited the lead into the far turn, was showing signs of
tiring into the stretch, and was steadied in the final strides. PRANCE trailed early, gained closer order then was sandwiched and checked hard in traffic.
CAPA BELLA chased outside and failed to threaten. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run. After review BABS
DELIGHT was disqualified and placed fourth for interference to PRANCE. THRILL OF THE NITE was disqualified and placed fifth for interference to
PRANCE.

stalked inside, and chased into the stretch but was no match for the winner. BEAUTIFUL MESS trailed the field, closed well late to earn show honors. MI
REYNA stalked from the three path, and lacked a kick that was needed. DAMN THE TORPEDOES fanned four wide into the opening turn, and was through
early.

DANCE SHOES was reserved off the early lead under a snug hold, moved up between foes in the backstretch to contest the pace, took over willingly in the
far turn, and kicked away when asked. PLUM BLUE saved ground inside, was asked to quicken leaving the backstretch, was roused at the head of the lane
then rallied inside of JELLI and edged clear for second. JELLI was under a strong hold early when passing by the frontside, pressed three wide through the
backstretch, was unable to move on with the eventual winner, rallied outside of PLUM BLUE then missed finishing clearly third-best. SASSY CINDERELLA
sat off the early pace, and lacked a bid. GRACEFUL SPIRIT quickly went to the front to set the pace, and tired early.

ITSALLGOODMAN sat in striking position outside through the backstretch, overtook the front willingly, was roused at the head of the stretch and opened up
to an easy win. J J'S CAPER contended the early pace, was overtaken leaving the backstretch, was no match for the winner, and finished clearly
second-best. SAWCHUK settled mid-pack, swung five in the final turn, and was just up late to score show honors. SUDDENLY FAMOUS saved early,
chased into the final turn, and was nipped at the wire. CAPE'S LEGACY chased to no avail. JAKOBS ROCKET BOY contested the early pace, and faded
steadily. HOLY JOE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MISS MIEZIE quickly went to the front, saved ground while showing the way, responded to looming threats and was kept under steady handling through the
stretch. JODEYS LIL PAIN stalked the pace from the three path, moved up closer into the final turn then chased through the stretch gaining ground late.
MORNING RAIN sat just off the pace in the two path, and lacked a kicked late. SADIE MY LADY lodged a bid in the far turn but failed to threaten. BROKEN
PROMISES lodged a mild late bid. KULSUM saved to no avail. DESTIN TO BE GREAT showed little.

Footnotes
BIG HUG sat in striking position just off the early pacesetters, swept the lead into the final turn, opened up when asked to an effortless win. BRYNN'S
DREAM went three to four wide leaving the opening turn, advanced quickly through the final turn, and closed well to earn place. ECHO CREEK unhurried
early from along the rail, the rider took hold near the quarter pole, and rallied belatedly. LILLY'S OF LONDON prompted the early pace, and lacked a closing
response. SKIP'S ROCK set a pressed pace, was overtaken into the final turn, and yielded. I SAID QUIET some late interest. SMOKIN JOY offered little.
FASTESTGIRLINTOWN lagged early then ranged up five wide leaving the front side, and tired. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of
ECHO CREEK against the rider of BRYNN'S DREAM alleging interference at the quarter pole was dissallowed.

ROCKTILLYOUDROP went four to five wide leaving the opening turn, moved up alongside RAILWAY to challenge the lead, responded to pressure from
DECOY and prevailed under a drive. DECOY was under a snug hold leaving the opening turn, moved up closer then launched an all-out bid into the stretch
but was unable to get by after a determined effort. CREDIBILITY raced wide through the opening turn, fanned three wide entering the backstretch, was
unable to move on with foes then was kept to steady handling through the stretch and held. COUNTRIFIED trailed early, shifted out to the three path, and
improved position late. VIATURE steadied leaving the opening turn, gained closer order, and weakened. EL NOBLE checked then angled out sharply
leaving the opening turn, trailed and lacked a serious bid. DRINKING AGAIN showed some early speed into the first turn, and dropped back. RAILWAY
sprinted to the lead, was overtaken and gaveway. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry in the first turn but made no change.

Footnotes
JEFF FA FA sent for speed, opened up to good margins in the backstretch, remained uncovered into the stretch then geared down late setting a new track
record. RUMOHR REIGNS trailed the field early, advanced quickly outside leaving the backstretch, rallied outside of BARE BACK JACK into the stretch,
and won the bob. BARE BACK JACK sat in range from between foes, went in pursuit of the leader but was no match, responded to a challenge from
RUMOHR REIGNS, and lost the bob. SOLO RING went three wide in the opening turn, chased inside, and improved position late. BACKSTREET BOBBY
trailed early and offered a late mild bid. DANCING WILLIE chased inside, and wilted. SMARTY RIVER PANTS offered little. AMUSING WAY settled well off
the pace from the three path, and was done early.

Footnotes
SMART PLAY contested the early pace while four to five wide leaving the opening turn, dueled through the backstretch outside of PUMP THE BRAKES,
disposed of rival, and won going away. FLASHFORDANI raced three-wide early, gave chased leaving the backstretch, rallied four wide into the stretch, and
inched clear for place. ZICATELA raced four to five wide leaving the backstretch, sat in a striking range from the four path, rallied in the stretch, and
weakened in the final yards. ESCROW STYLE unhurried early, chased hard leaving the backstretch, and flattened out. THESHACK was under a snug hold
inside early, stalked the pacesetters in the backstretch, and evened out. SILVERFOOT bid belatedly. PUMP THE BRAKES contended the early pace,
dueled through the backstretch, was unable to move on with rival, and gave way. REMARKABLE ELI attended the early pace from along the rail, and tired.
TUCKER TIME was not a factor.
