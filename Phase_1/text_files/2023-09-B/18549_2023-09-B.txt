FATHER O'FLAHERTY rated well off the pace, bid from rail and got by in time. THESHACK showed the way to the backstretch, turned back challenge from
BODEMONSTER and weakened deep stretch. BODEMONSTER tracked inside, launched a bid and needed more. DANCING WILLIE sat in range and
faded late stretch. CREDIBILITY stalked three wide, and lacked the closing response. NORTHERN JEWEL offered little.

Footnotes
PRANCE tracked inside early, waiting for running room in the backstretch, shifted out to the three path in the far turn taking over, and drew off under a
confident hand ride. WHISKARITA raced from the second flight while four wide, sat in striking position outside in the backstretch, was no match for the
eventual winner and finished clearly second best. FAVORITE trailed the field early, swung out into the final turn, and improved position in the drive.
WHITEROSE SPIRIT vied four wide into the opening turn, stalked the pace while three wide, challenged the front leaving the backstretch, and was caught
late. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY attended the early pace from just off the rail, led the way into the backstretch, and was overtaken and faded steadily. LITTLE
HARPER opted to sit just off the pace while three wide leaving the opening turn, and tired early. MIDNIGHT GARDEN was outsprinted to the opening turn,
and lacked interest.

BARE BACK JACK stalked the early pacesetters, raced in close quarters leaving the backstretch in the three path, drove three wide into the stretch and
narrowly prevailed. ESTIFRAAD saved ground early, cut the corner into the stretch, and was outfinished. THE BEAT trailed the field early, gained closer
order nearing the last turn, and closed gamely to score show. COMMON KNOWLEDGE dueled for the early lead, inherited an advantage leaving the
backstretch, and came up empty in the drive. BORKAN stalked the dueling pacesetters while three to four wide, and lacked a closing response needed.
AMUSING WAY contested the lead inside of COMMON KNOWLEDGE and tired early.

MISSCZECH broke alertly, saved ground while showing the way, drew clear nearing the final turn, and held late. PLUM BLUE unhurried early, gained closer

DANCE SHOES sat in striking position from the two path, went in pursuit of MISSCZEH but lacked the closing response that was needed. TONE IT UP
saved ground and lacked a kick. MINE ME raced three wide through the opening turn, was unable to move on with the field and gave way. ORANGE

Footnotes
LIFES ADVENTURE led the way into the opening turn, drew clear through the backstretch, came under encouragement into the stretch, and had enough
cushion to hold safely. BRODY'S PAL stalked the pace from the rail, shifted out to the three path at the head of the lane, but was unable to reach the
eventual winner. SILVERFOOT raced near the back early, gained ground quickly leaving the backstretch, and closed with good energy late. H K MELODY
trailed the field early, raced four to five wide in the final turn, and bid belatedly. LOLLIPOP KID fanned four wide entering the backstretch, chased into the far
turn, and faded. REMARKABLE ELI stalked the pace from the two path between rivals, and was outrun. PADDYS ROCKET broke awkwardly leaving,
fanned three wide nearing the first turn, and lacked bid. BARAK angled down to the rail in the first turn, and lacked interest.

Footnotes
SMARTY RIVER PANTS allowed to settle two to three wide into the opening turn, angled to the three path leaving the backstretch, rallied into the lane, and
drew clear late. PUMP THE BRAKES attended the early pace, rallied from between foes leaving the backstretch, and just held for place. BIG AL'S VISION
trailed the field early, advanced quickly from along the rail in the final turn, and closed huge just missing out for second place honors. ISLE OF SKYE set the
pace from the rail, took pressure through the backstretch and gave way grudgingly late stretch. GRIGORO offered little. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES raced
three to four wide in the first turn, and failed to produce a bid. ALL THAT GOLD contested the early pace while three wide, and stopped.

Footnotes
KAUAI DAN was under a strong hold while in traffic through the opening turn, shifted out to the four path then opened up through the final turn, and geared
down late. HANDSOME HENRY stalked three to four wide into the first turn, chased the leader into the lane, was gaining ground late but was no match for
the winner. CALI CONQUEST took closer order through the backstretch, drove five wide at the head of the lane, and rallied late for show. MACHINE saved
ground from the rail, rallied into the final turn and was outfinished. FINALIZE pressed the early pace, chased the eventual winner in the far turn, and came
up empty for the drive. VANTASTICCANAVERAL set a pressured pace, was unable to move on with rivals and tired. PACHECO went four to five wide
leaving the front side, and failed to threaten. ADIOS Y GRACIAS was under a strong hold nearing the opening turn, fanned three wide, and was outrun.

Footnotes
SUDDENLY FAMOUS contested the early pace outside of J J'S CAPER, disposed of rival and drew away. SAWCHUK raced four wide into the opening
turn, took closer order through the backstretch, lodged a rail bid into the lane, and held place. THISCATSGOTSPEED sat midpack while three wide, chased
into the final turn while driving four to five wide, and lacked the rally needed. KULSUM stalked the early pacesetters while three wide, and failed to threaten
in the drive. J J'S CAPER contended the pace from along the rail, was unable to move on with SUDDENLY FAMOUS and faded. CAPE'S LEGACY lacked a
serious bid. DERMOT'S DILEMMA showed little. SUNNY WAY chased to no avail. SADIE MY LADY bumped then ducked in away from the gate, chased
hard outside and tired.

Footnotes
THRILL OF THE NITE raced three wide into the opening turn, contested the pace through the backstretch, and drove clear into the lane.
EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE was under a snug hold through the opening turn, found a seam between foes leaving the backstretch, dueled into the drive and
was outfinished. NO BAKK TALK hustled away racing four wide into the backstretch, sat in a striking position, rallied five wide at the head of the lane, closed
gradually and missed. MAGICAL LADY unhurried early, moved up closer through traffic, rallied into the stretch, and weakened late. QUEEN RHONDA went
three wide into the opening turn, chased four to five wide leaving the last turn, and improved position in the final yards. SUGAR MOON vied inside through
the opening turn, was overtaken and flattened. MOHAYMEN DAY raced wide into the backstretch, and had no response when called upon. TAKE CHARGE
GWEN lost position early into the backstretch, lacked running room from along the rail, and yielded in stretch. LOAD ABROAD went five wide into the
opening turn, chased outside and wilted.
