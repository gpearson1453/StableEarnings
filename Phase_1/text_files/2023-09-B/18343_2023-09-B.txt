Footnotes
STAY SASSY stalked the pace racing in hand, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole, caught the leaders nearing the eighth pole, dueled with
HANNAHAZA HETTY from that point and prevailed narrowly in a stiff drive. HANNAHAZA HETTY saved ground while being forwardly placed, was in tight
lacking room nearing the three-eighths pole, angled out two-wide splitting rivals nearing the quarter pole, dueled for the lead the final eighth and just missed
in a tough decision. NORTHERN LINCHPIN was allowed to settle early while three-wide, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished in a mild
rally. SENSIBLE LUTE saved ground setting the pace to the eighth pole and then weakened late. HOLDMYGOLDMISSY hopped slightly at the start, then
was two-wide while being unhurried and failed to menace. CLEARWATER BELLE dropped back while saving ground and was not a threat. LIBBY'S
GAMBIT was four-wide while racing in the middle of the field and gave way before going a half mile.

late. CAPIAT was forwardly placed to the stretch while three-wide and weakened. SMILING PREACHER settled in the middle of the field while racing

Footnotes
ITSTEQUILA TALKIN vied with POCKET KNIFE for the lead from along the outside, disposed of that one at the eighth pole and increased her advantage.
POCKET KNIFE vied for the lead from along the inside, was no match for the winner but was clearly second best. RIVER DANCE saved ground after
breaking a step slow and finished in a mild rally. MY YVONNE was unhurried early, came two-wide into the stretch, angled out for the drive and failed to
threaten. NADITA saved ground chasing the pass, came three-wide into the stretch and tired.
