Footnotes
ELUSIVE WAR raced on the rail, stalked the early leader, raced just behind his girth, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, moved up, matched a few
strides, took command, hooked another rival in the upper stretch, battled gamely down the stretch, tit for tat, remained determined, showed grit and pulled in
front right before the wire taking this win. BIG CITY BOY was off a step slow, advanced down the back side, raced in the four path, shifted into the six path,
launched a bid at the three eights pole, circled the field through the turn, drew beside the new leader at the quarter pole, ignited a battle the ensured the
entire stretch drive, these battled heads up until the last two lengths, gave to in to his determined rival finishing second. TATER stalked the front runner from
the four path, maintained that spot moving into the turn, shuffled back a few strides through the turn, inched out into the six path in the upper stretch, was
encouraged and responded well closing lively on the out side, passing rivals who had just previously gone past him on the turn, closing in on the first too
horses getting up for third. CHEROKEE LEGACY was off mid pack, raced in the two path in between foes, kept on through the stretch drive, out finishing
the rest. DOMINANT OKIE stalked the first tier of horses from the three path, raced in between rivals, advanced through the turn, raced up behind the front
runners, was in contention but had no late kick today. EARS TO ME raced off of the pace in the four path, but could not get involved today. AWESOME
OUTLAW raced from the middle of the field, raced on the rail, saved ground, moved up on the inside through the turn, tired late. FURIOUS AVENGER raced
off of the pace, raced on the rail but showed little today. MIRANDEN vied for the lead, raced in the two path, took command, set the pace, then stopped in
the stretch.

Footnotes
WHATS UP SWEETS tucked to save ground through the opening turn, loomed on the heels of pace duo along he backstretch, came under rousing around
the final bend, angled out to three wide at upper stretch, and earned the score while under a stiff drive. ITSONLYMONEYHONEY broke alertly and pressed
the pace throught he opening half from a two path pose, gained command near the quarter pole, locked into a brief stretch duel, but was unable to fend off
the eventual winner in the end. BLING ON THE LIGHT flashed early foot and led the field through the opening half from a ground saving stance before
giving way to top pair inside the quarter pole. WICKED SONG trekked three wide around the opening bend, loomed boldly along the backstretch, then was
unable to match strides with lead trio in the closing strides. LADY ENVOY chased the early leaders from a three path pose through the first call, then
steadily lost ground to front runners. SEXY RAGS trailed throughout and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
TEXAS BAD BOY hustled from outset and established first command, led ever step of the way and opened up on all rivals in homestretch for a clear and
convincing score. STOCKPILER trekked the three path from a mid pack rated stance through the first turn, closed gap on leader along the backstretch,
swung three wide at upper stretch, but was unable to catch tough winner in final furlong. JIM AND JIM gave chase to pacesetting duo from a three path
pose through the opening half, trekked three wide around the closing bend, locked into a stretch duel for place honors but was bested by that rival and
forced to settle for show. SO BRAVE settled into mid pack before floating extra wide near the quarter pole and at upper stretch, then finished evenly. MR
OKLAHOMA CITY saved ground from a back rated stance and passed tiring rival in late stages. TEXAS PRADO steadily faded in the latter portion of
contest after stalking the early pace from a two path pose. GAMMA RAY tucked to save ground shortly after the start and trailed the filed throughout.
