Footnotes
MAJOR FED tracked along the inside, loomed a bold danger from the pocket around the far turn, tipped outside of the top pair entering the lane, shot past
them in upper stretch and kicked away. THE HONORABLE ONE tracked two wide and between horses, chased under urging in the three path and among
foes around the far turn, floated to the five path entering the lane, lacked progress before changing leads at the three sixteenths pole, then ran on outside of
foes in the final furlong and edged place late. COUSIN LARRY saved ground off of the pace, was urged along around the far turn, smoothly split foes two
wide in midstretch to bid for place, but was outfinished by an outer rival in the closing stages. SHORTLIST broke a step slow at the start, laid off of the pace
in the two to three path, shifted to the four path in upper stretch and ran on mildly between horses. TREASURY set the pace in the two path around the first
turn, then along the fence while feeling outer pressure around the far turn, but offered no resistance to an outer rival's bid in upper stretch and weakened.
COOL RAGS pursued from midpack while hung four wide, lacked a response to heavy urging around the far turn, then entered the lane in the six path and
failed to factor. BOISE stalked three wide, pressed the leader around the far turn, but was quickly outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch and faded
between horses. WHAT A COUNTRY showed little.

Footnotes
SPARKLE OF HOPE tracked three wide, ranged up in hand to bid entering the lane, was kept at throatlatch level by the leader through midstretch, edged
past that tiring foe passing the sixteenth pole and lasted from an outer pair late. MAGNA MASSA set the pace along the inside, sparred with an outer rival
around the turn, yielded in upper stretch, yet switched course outwardly at the furlong grounds, came again three wide and between horses as the leaders
tired and narrowly gained place while running out of ground to reel in the leader. PILLBOX prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, led turning for
home, gamely fended off an outer bidder through midstretch, but was bested leaving the sixteenth pole, gave way and got nailed at the wire for place.
MOTOWN MIKA settled off of the pace in the two path, swung to the five path entering the lane, and ran on outside of rivals in the final furlong to miss in the
photo for place. HARMONICA trailed under heavy urging in the four path around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
UNINVITED GUEST settled at the rear along the inside, launched a rally in the four to five path around the far turn, took aim while fanning six wide entering
the lane, bid along with an inner TRES SOLES in upper stretch, dueled with that one through the final furlong and determinedly wrestled a narrow
advantage in the shadow of the wire. TRES SOLES rated far back in the two path, gained in the three to four path along with an outer rival turning for home,
spun into the lane five wide, bid along with his outer counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, gamely clung to a narrow margin from that one into deep
stretch, but was bested in the closing stages. COASTAL DEFENSE broke inwardly and brushed a rival at the start, tracked two wide, ranged up three wide
around the far turn, bid four wide entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer pair at the three sixteenths pole, gave way through the final furlong yet
saved show between horses. DOCTOR NASH tracked along the inside, inched closer to the tiring leader along with an outer pair turning for home, paused
behind that one entering the lane, aimed to split foes two wide in upper stretch, but failed to do so before that hole closed at the three sixteenths pole, got
outkicked by outer rivals in the process then lacked a bid between horses. TAKE THE CHARGE took light contact from an outer rival at the start, tugged
clear around the first turn, tired and came back to the field turning for home, got headed by outer rivals in upper stretch and weakened. NULLARBOR
stalked in the three to two path around the first turn, inched closer to the tiring leader while under urging between horses around the far turn, attempted a
mild bid in the three path entering the lane but yielded in upper stretch. TEPEU lacked speed three wide, trailed around the far turn and was outrun
thereafter.

Footnotes
WOODCOURT tracked along the inside, tipped to the two path entering the backstretch, was roused in pursuit in the three to four path around the far turn,
sustained a grinding charge through midstretch to offer a bid at the sixteenth pole and edged ahead. LEGAL TITAN stalked along the inside, pursued the
top pair from the two to three path around the far turn, bid three wide nearing midstretch, led as an outer rival bid entering the final sixteenth, but flopped
back to his left lead and got bested. COPPER MISSILE broke a step slow at the start, lacked speed in the two path, pursued two wide around the far turn,
shifted to the four path in upper stretch, then flopped back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole, surged late and reached show at the wire. VALUE
ENGINEER prompted inside of a rival while in the three path around the first turn, stalked outside of that one down the backstretch, bid and vied around the
far turn, dueled through midstretch as an outer rival joined the fray, but was bested at the sixteenth pole, yielded and got nailed for show. STEELER
MISCHIEF brushed with an inner rival at the start, showed speed outside of a rival and in the four path around the far turn, crossed over to the inside while
showing the way at the five furlong pole, dueled with his outer re-bidding counterpart around the far turn and through midstretch, but yielded passing the
sixteenth pole. SAVE THE KING broke a step slow before brushing with an outer rival at the start, then failed to factor three wide. HAM SANDWICH laid off
of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the four path and failed made little impact in the five path. STRIKING SPARKS saved ground off of the pace but to
no avail. DUMBSTRUCK was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
PURSUIT OF LIBERTY prompted the pace two wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, led in the three path entering the lane, drove clear approaching
midstretch as an outer LADY MOSCATO pursued, and inched further away late. LADY MOSCATO stalked in the three path, took aim on the new leader
from the four path entering the lane, gained place in pursuit at the three sixteenths pole and chased the leader home to prove second best. NORISKIT
NOBISCUIT laid close up along the inside and behind the top pair around the turn, lost show to an outer rival entering the lane, yet regained that position
after slipping inside of the tiring early pace-setter at the three sixteenths pole and chased the leading pair home. CALLE REINA was a bit antsy in the
starting gate awaiting others to load, then broke slowly, lacked speed along the inside, tipped to the two path into the turn, swung five wide entering the lane
and stayed on to improve position. MY FAVORITE GIRL pursued from midpack in the four path and chased evenly through the lane. MURPHY'S GIFT
chased along the inside and failed to menace while hanging on his left lead. SPEAK UP pursued from midpack in the two to three path and lacked a rally
between horses. THORNY laid off of the pace three wide, got floated six wide entering the lane and failed to offer a rally. STARINA broke slowly and never
got involved from the two path. HONOR CAT set the pace along the inside, met the eventual winner's bid at the five sixteenths pole, got headed nearing the
lane in the two path and weakened between horses. BUMP IN THE NIGHT lacked a response to urging in the four to six path around the turn and failed to
factor. PRETTY GIRLS UNION broke slowly and showed little.

Footnotes
FIGHTERTOWN prompted along the inside before stalking his outer counterpart entering the backstretch, tipped two wide with over five furlongs to go, rebid
approaching the far turn, led at the seven sixteenths pole, showed the way around that bend, inched a clear margin in upper stretch as an outer SINGLE
RULER menaced, fended off that foe's bid nearing the final sixteenth and gamely held to the wire. SINGLE RULER settled off of the pace two wide, ranged
up four wide turning for home to take aim on the clear leader in upper stretch, chased while slowly closing in entering the final furlong, bid nearing the final
sixteenth, sparred through the late stages and narrowly missed. CARNIVORE tracked two to three wide, required urging to sustain position between horses
around the far turn, then chased the top pair home to prove best of the rest. BUCKTOWN tracked along the inside, tipped to the three to four path entering
the lane but lacked a bid. IMPULSIVENESS trailed around both turns and improved position between horses late. LAST COOKIE laid off of the pace along
the inside, took the far turn in the three path and made little impact. LOVE SPELL vied outside of a rival and in the three path, showed the way entering the
backstretch, gradually shifted down passing the five furlong pole, but was headed by an outer rival into the far turn, sustained inner pressure around that
bend and weakened entering the lane.

YOUR SO SILLEA vied two wide, led turning for home, drew off in the three path entering the lane and held sway from inner pursuers. KANTEX laid off of
the pace in the three path, rallied between horses to gain place at the sixteenth pole while aiming inside of the clear leader, but needed more to reel that one
in. LEELOO tracked two wide, pursued the leading trio from the two path around the turn, sustained a chase to gain place in midstretch, but was bested by
an outer rival for that position at the sixteenth pole. ALTERED SHOT prompted three wide, stalked the top pair around the turn, but failed to keep pace with
the clearing leader entering the lane before getting floated to the six path, and lacked a bid thereafter. MY KENTUCKY GIRL rushed between horses to vie
along the inside after a quarter mile, sparred with the eventual winner into the turn, got headed by that one turning for home, yielded and shifted out at the
quarter pole, then faltered in the five path and between horses in upper stretch. FOUR DAWN broke multiple lengths slow, raced towards the rear in the two
path into the turn and failed to menace. FAST AND FEMININE trailed in the three path into the turn and made little impact. ROCK STAR PARKING checked
back at the five furlong pole to track along the inside, but steadily gave way around the turn. MERCY WARREN chased four wide and faltered into the turn.

MORE THAN LOOKS settled far back three wide, swung to the six path entering the lane, unleashed a good kick to take aim on the clear leader in the final
furlong, swept past that one at the sixteenth pole and drew clear. SMOKEY MANDATE stalked the clear leader two wide, inched closer entering the lane,
bid in the three path at the three sixteenths pole, kicked clear shortly after, but offered little resistance to an outer rival's bold bid at the sixteenth pole and
was second best. WORTHINGTON laid off of the pace two wide, then rallied in the final furlong and split foes at the sixteenth pole to gain show. OCEAN
POINTE hopped and leaned inwardly at the start, trailed along the inside, fanned to the five path entering the lane before tipping wider in upper stretch, then
offered a late kick to gain fourth at the wire. NOISES OFF pursued from midpack in the two path, shifted to the four path entering the lane, but was
outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch and ran on mildly. OCEAN VISION (IRE) tracked along the inside, pursued in the three path around the far turn,
but lacked a kick in upper stretch, got outmoved by an outer rallying rival at the three sixteenths pole and yielded between horses. GASLIGHT DANCER set
the pace three to two wide around the first turn, drew clear entering the backstretch, maintained a clear margin around the far turn, but was caught by an
outer bidder at the three sixteenths pole and weakened. TIVERTON (GB) settled off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the three path before
fanning to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a rally. MIDNIGHT WEST prompted along the inside into the first turn, stalked entering the backstretch,
but weakened around the far turn.

ZOZOS set a pressured pace just a bit off of the inside around the turn, responded readily once set down entering the lane, shook clear in upper stretch and
held sway from a pair of outer pursuers. STAGE RAIDER stalked along the inside, shifted three wide entering upper stretch to take aim on the clearing
leader, then sustained a grinding charge in pursuit through the final furlong but needed more to reel that one in late. THREE TECHNIQUE settled off of the
pace in the three path, fanned five wide entering the lane, then stayed on while gradually closing in on the top pair in the final furlong, but was only best of
the rest. O BESOS tracked two wide and between horse, got floated four wide by an inner rival in upper stretch, yielded shortly after, yet surpassed a tiring
inner pair of rivals in the final furlong to reach a minor placing. CADDO RIVER prompted the pace two wide, bid nearing the lane, but failed to keep pace
with the leader in upper stretch and gave way. SEIZE THE NIGHT laid off of the pace along the inside and failed to factor. SKYRO tracked three wide,
entered the lane four wide and between horses, but shied from an inner rival being floated across his path in upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
CLAPTON settled far back two wide, crept closer subtly under strong urging four to five wide turning for home, fanned six wide entering the lane, rallied
while shifting inwardly in upper stretch, took aim on the clear leader in the final furlong, offered a bid approaching the wire and forged an advantage at it.
TRADEMARK stalked along the inside, vacated the rail in the early stages of the backstretch while pursuing the top pair, tracked in the three path around
the far turn, bid in the four path entering the lane, shifted inwardly while driving clear approaching midstretch, held sway from a chaser on either side into the
final furlong, but flopped back to his left lead as an outer CLAPTON closed in entering the final sixteenth and was worn down at the wire. BLUE DEVIL laid
off of the pace in the two path, gained between horses entering the lane, took aim inside of the new leader entering midstretch, then chased well while
needing more. RATTLE N ROLL saved ground far off of the pace, came under urging entering the far turn, tipped to the three path entering the lane,
improved between horses in upper stretch before altering course around a tiring rival a the furlong grounds, but lacked a further bid to threaten the top trio.
HAPPY AMERICAN lagged well behind around both turns, then showed strong late interest between horses in the final furlong. AMERICANREVOLUTION
stalked two wide, bid into the far turn, led in the three path passing the three furlong pole, but met an outer challenge entering the lane and faltered between
horses in upper stretch. WHELEN SPRINGS pursued from midpack in the three path, chased under urging in the four path around the far turn, fanned to the
five path entering the lane and gave way. FIVE STAR GENERAL set the pace along the inside, but was headed by an outer bidder at the three furlong pole
and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
BRIGADE COMMANDER tracked in the three to two path, ranged up three wide around the far turn to take aim on the leader entering the lane, sustained a
bid in midstretch, then flopped back to his left lead in the final furlong and edged ahead. ATHENS MOON set the pace along the inside with a low
head-carriage, held sway through upper stretch, resisted the eventual winner's bid in midstretch but was bested late. MISSIONAIRE saved ground off of the
pace, tipped three wide and between horses entering the lane, then split foes through narrow quarters at the furlong grounds to edge show. NOW THAT
ICAN ROCK laid off of the pace three wide, inched closer four wide around the far turn, vied for show with an inner rival through midstretch but was
outkicked by an inner bidder at the sixteenth pole. ROYAL SALUTE saved ground in midpack, advanced three wide and between horses entering the lane,
vied for show with an outer rival coming to midstretch, but was bested by a foe-splitting rival for that position. GIVEN TO FLY (IRE) laid off of the pace two
wide and between horses, took the far turn in the four path and lacked a bid. ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN was taken up soon after the start, raced at the rear
three wide, got hung five wide around the far turn, then moved up. ELEGANT TRIP bumped an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack two wide and
between horses, but gave way around the far turn. HOGSLAYERS R I P bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced forwardly while keen moving past the
wire for the first time, brushed an outer foe causing a brief steady into the first turn, settled into stalking stride along the inside around that bend, but
weakened through the lane. ROYAL SANDRIN broke a beat slow, raced at the rear two wide and between horses, bumped an inner rival turning for home
and made little impact. ORBI ONE took contact from rivals on both sides at the start, raced forwardly two wide, took contact from an inner rival entering the
first turn, stalked two wide before chasing between horses around the far turn, and weakened. METALLURGIC lacked speed along the inside, took contact
from an outer rival and was forced to brush the rail turning for home, then got outrun thereafter.
