CHIP'S FRIEND controlled the pace inside, was collared in midstretch and held pair of rivals safe while continuing gamely. FLORIANOPOLIS stalked the
pacesetter outside, faded briefly then came again late to regain the place. PRINCIPE saved ground throughout, loomed a stretch threat then hung.
CURTEIS dropped back early, moved wide on the final turn then flattened out in the stretch. SETTE STELLE trailed for half a mile, moved inside then
weakened. DOCTOR MAGIC was urged close up wide for three quarters then faltered. ARTHUR S GOLD raced within range briefly then stopped abruptly.
SHEA D CAPTURE gave way after a quarter mile losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
EMIRATES AFFAIR raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, bid and led into the stretch then drew off under moderate pressure. MARION GRACE broke a
step slowly, moved up inside, angled out to secure room into the stretch but was no match for the winner. JEZEBEL JADE trailed in the opening quarter
outside, bid wide on the turn and had only a mild rally. SYSTEMIC RISK sprinted clear in the opening quarter, was collared at the quarter pole and yielded.
COLLIN'S GREY LADY raced close up outside under rating then proved empty in the stretch. ET'S MOON MAIDEN saved ground early and was never a
factor. CLOUT CHASER lacked speed, steadied along into the far turn and faded.

after the winner following half a mile and continued willingly while no serious threat. GINGERS WISH settled off the leaders, moved inside ni the stretch with
a gradual gain. SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD pressed the pace for half a mile then began weakening on the final turn. CLASSY MISS lacked speed three wide

DEWEY DOIT earned a narrow lead inside, shook loose on the turn then extended her advantage in mild drive. KISS FOR LUCK forced the pace outside
then pursued the winner the remainder of the way in a game effort. BAILINTIN bumped about early, chased wide then flattened out in the stretch. MADE
BIRDIE dropped back very wide down the backstretch then rallied mildly. R FASHIONABLY LATE was urged just off the leaders outside and gave way
readily. FIRST JOKE chased outside dueling leaders through the initial quarter then stopped.

Footnotes
COACH HAS SIX ACES rated just outside the pacesetter, took over when ready on the final turn and drew off under mild pressure. TOURING MARYANNE
chased close up between rivals, angled wide on the turn and closed well. BOHEMIA BABE hustled to a clear lead inside, was collared midway on the turn
and weakened. MOONBOOTS lacked speed along the inside, made a brief bid on the turn then flattened out. GETAWAY PALACE moved just off the pace
inside for five furlongs and faltered. PAGEANT PRINCESS settled off the pace three wide then was finished by the three eighths pole.
THAT'STONY'SSISTER dropped back early and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HE'S INCREDIBLE vied in the two path, shook loose in midstretch and just lasted while shortening stride late. HE HATE ME far behind early, split rivals
rallying in the stretch with a strong bid. SAPONARA alternated lead with the winner along the rail and weakened in the stretch. HIDE THE RANSOM chased
off the pace, angled inside and finished willingly. CRYPT trailed for half a mile then narrowed the gap racing wide. EMPIRE'S SCORE awaited room behind
pacesetters down backstretch, bid between rivals on the turn then faded. OSPREY was urged close up four wide, drifted wider in the stretch and faltered.
BUCKS ARE MOVING broke slowly, raced far behind and was never a factor. SMALL REASON moved close up along the inside to the turn and stopped.
