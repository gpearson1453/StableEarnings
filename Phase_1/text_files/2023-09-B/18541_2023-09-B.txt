Footnotes
MO'S MOJO rated just off the pace in the opening quarter, circled up three to four wide late on the turn, sustained response into the lane and forged clear.
SIR DEPUTY stalked the top pair up the backstretch, launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, held a slim lead at the eighth pole then got overtaken by the
winner. SWAGGY GEORGE rated on the inside up the backstretch, shifted out four wide entering the lane, steadily gained ground along the outside and
just missed place. OCEAN RIDE was forwardly placed in opening stages, chased two wide up close around the turn, ran on into the lane and secured a
minor share. MAHOMES raced off the pace, saved ground around the turn and lacked a needed rally. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE was off a step awkward at
the start, raced off the pace, came three wide into upper stretch and never threatened. NORTH SIDE set the pace up the backstretch, continued to hold firm
around the turn, got collared nearing the eighth pole and retreated. PUBLIC SAFETY showed little.

SIMMERING vied inside around the first turn then shook free and set the pace up the backstretch, widened advantage still unleashed around the turn,
saved ground turning for home, roused for more upper stretch, responded willingly, tapped once in the final furlong and drew off. HARD SPIRITS vied three
deep for the lead around the first turn then stalked the pace setter up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid for SIMMERING around the final turn, was no
match for pulling away winner but sustained bid and finished clearly second best. STREAKIN' EASY vied between rivals around the first turn, tracked the
leader up the backstretch, hustled along the inside around the far turn then faded in the lane. THE AWFUL TRUTH saved ground on the first turn, continued
in the back, swung four wide leaving the final turn and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
ROCKETS SISTER vied for the lead in opening stages then edged back into tracking position, moved back up midway around the turn, vied with
DREAMINONTHENILE and BATTER UP BETTY at the eighth pole, dug in gamely and kicked clear. DREAMINONTHENILE vied for the lead in opening
stages then edged away and led the way into the turn, came back under pressure from ROCKETS SISTER and vied at the quarter pole, took on the added
challenge of inside running BATTER UP BETTY near the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner late but fought back and captured place.
BATTER UP BETTY raced off the early pace, gained ground on the rail around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, roused forward to duel for the lead
a furlong out, could not hold off the winner but stayed on with response and cleared the rest. FLAT OUT ROSE tracked the top pair while saving ground
through early stages, came under a ride three wide around the turn, hustled along three to four wide into the lane and failed to kick on. BIZ B QUICK raced
in the back, saved ground around the turn and had no response. KASA raced in early contention then weakened two wide late on the turn.

DEMIDANU tracked the pacesetter in early stages, was ridden up closer racing two wide into the turn, took a slim lead from SPANISH DELIGHT a furlong
out and kicked clear. MY GOLDEN DAY was reserved racing in the back, picked up the tempo two wide heading into upper stretch, angled to the inside and
finished willingly. SPANISH DELIGHT set the pace up the backstretch and held firm around the turn, got collared for the lead at the furlong marker and
weakened late. SUGAR SHACK QUEEN hopped at the start and settled off the early pace, was ridden three wide into upper stretch, failed to respond and
steadily weakened. SAMIRA tracked the early pace, saved ground around the turn then faded through the lane.

responded, dug in gamely under pressure from HALOSNHEAVEN and prevailed. HALOSNHEAVEN raced near midpack in early stages, gained on the
inside around the turn then tipped out turning for home, roused forward two wide , raced in striking distance for the lead, dug in gamely but could not get by
the winner. SINGING EMMA tracked the pace in close contention, chased three wide around the turn, sustained bid into stretch run and secured a share.
BUG A BOO was reserved racing in the back, saved ground around the turn, tipped three wide for the drive and finished with response. MINNIE'S READY
rated off the early pace, saved ground and hustled up inside around the turn, continued to chase along the inside and needed more for late impact. BYE

acme three wide into the lane and never threatened. ADDABABY was forwardly placed, chased in contention around the turn then faded in the lane. WAR

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT RULES was nicely rated on the inside up the backstretch, let out a notch and edged up closer along the rail mid-way around the far turn, tipped
two wide turning for home, given cue upper stretch, responded, steadily edged up closer and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. COLORFUL NATIVE led the
way around the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch, saved ground and held firm around the far turn, dug in under pressure from oncoming
MIDNIGHT RULES then got overtaken near the final sixteenth. ON A DARE was unhurried up the backstretch, urged along inside into stretch run, sustained
inside bid and cleared a share. KOBE'S CAUSE stalked the pace setter up the backstretch, chased two wide in contention around the turn then gave way.
LEADING THE CAUSE rated off the early pace, saved ground on the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive and lacked a needed rally. TAP THE BRAKES
was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the pace up the backstretch, coaxed three wide around the far turn then weakened in the lane.
PRIZED TAP raced four to five wide around the turns and failed to move into contention. A BRUSH OF LUCK raced five wide heading into the first turn and
had no response. JUSTICE ONCE raced three wide into first turn, raced off the pace, came three wide into upper stretch and retreated through the lane.
