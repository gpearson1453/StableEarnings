Footnotes
GIVE ME THE LUTE was prominent early then pulled the rider along when taking in hand, switch to the outside and went up to pressure the leader at the
seven-sixteenths pole, dueled around the bend, put a head in front at the top of the lane, led into deep stretch and prevailed. INCH brushed with inner rival
at the start, stalked two wide into the turn, tipped out in the lane and took aim at the leaders, finished gamely from outside but could not get by. SUBSIDIZE
lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, tipped off the inside, put in a late bid between foes and missed the place. WESTWARD LOOK sped
clear to take control early, pressured leaving the backstretch, dueled from inside through the turn, lost command at the top of the lane, fought back into deep
stretch and was outfinished. JAMMING EDDY was bothered by MAVEN coming out over the dirt crossing and had to take up, raced between rivals into and
around the turn in the two path and could not rally. MARGOT'S BOY brushed leaving the gate, traveled three deep near the back to the stretch and failed to
respond. MAVEN hustled from the gate then jumped crossing onto the dirt then again moving back onto the turf, chased from inside to the lane and
weakened.

Footnotes
POETICA rated behind the front-runners, waited along the inside on the turn, roused at the quarter pole and snuck through leaving the bend, took over at
the top of the stretch, cleared with a furlong remaining under mild urging and was lightly coaxed to the wire. ESSENTIAL BUSINESS set the pace inside
SHE'S RESILIENT, showed the way two wide through the turn, leaving too much room for POETICA to challenge from inside past the quarter pole, lost
command at the three-sixteenths pole and stayed on for a clear second. KRISTI'S TIGER trailed into and around the bend in the two path, showed a mild
response when called upon and got up for the show. AMERICAN LILY steadied early, stalked three wide into the turn, challenged three to four wide with a
quarter mile remaining but flattened out in the furlong grounds. SHE'S RESILIENT pressed the pace from outside, could not stay with the leaders late on the
turn and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
GRAZED chased from outside then took a brief hold to move down inside, waited behind the leaders along the rail around the bend, tipped two wide leaving
the turn, angled out in upper stretch and drove clear. MAN O ROSE antsy in the gate, pressed three deep up the backstretch, vied for command around the
bend and took over late on the turn, overtaken by GRAZED approaching the sixteenth pole and managed to save the place. ANTIBES trailed on the inside
into the turn, lacked room at the five-sixteenths pole, tipped two wide late on the bend, moved out further in the drive, rallied and missed second. TOPPERS
WAGER settled inside, moved out in the lane and improved position. GRAND TIGER set the pace under pressure from outer rivals, vied around the bend
and lost command past the quarter pole, then weakened in the stretch run. TOUCHDOWN KITTLE broke inward, pressed the pace from between runners,
fought through the turn and also weakened in the lane. BEYOND COMPARE broke in, prominent early then got bothered by inner rival before the half-mile

SWEET HELLO broke a step slow then rushed up to the front and led four wide into the clubhouse turn, cleared and crossed over to the two path around
the bend, showed the way along the rail into the drive, kicked clear in upper stretch, ridden along into deep stretch and coasted in approaching the wire.
MISS KALINE brushed the winner leaving the gate, stalked two to three wide outside a rival, got bumped entering the backstretch, was closest in pursuit
entering the lane, was no match for the winner in upper stretch and churned on to secure the place. LIKE NO OTHER bobbled at the start but still came
away on top, rated along the inside, drifted out and bumped rival entering the backstretch, lost ground chasing after the winner on the far turn, asked right
handed into the stretch and weakened. POINT AND SHOOT chased four then three wide on the first turn, remained off the rail to the stretch and failed to
menace. ASPIRATIONAL stalked from inside, dropped back in the middle stages, continued along the rail through the far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
POTITO vied with outer rivals then assumed command up the backstretch, maintained command through the turn, fought with IMMELMANN down the lane
and held gamely to the wire. IMMELMANN took a bump from outside at the start, forwardly placed four then three deep, challenged from outside, fought
with POTITO through the lane and could not get by. NESTUCKA tracked between rivals, three deep at the quarter pole, spun four wide into the lane and
finished well for a game third. HIGH KING was off slow from inside, chased from off the pace, traveled along the rail through the turn before tipping two wide
entering the lane, looked to make a run but got boxed in through the final furlong and kept on without ever gaining clear path. ANNAN broke in and bumped
rival, tugged up the backstretch, eventually running into a tight spot and put on the brakes entering the turn, tipped two then three wide around the bend,
rallied while brushing with HIGH KING and needed to find more late. WHISKEY RYE raced up close three deep then applied some pressure from between
rivals around the bend, got put in a bit tight entering the lane, lacked room in the stretch and weakened late. LAST CALL PAUL showed some early speed
then chased up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn and lacked a bid. DON'T HIT ME BASH settled outside a pair of rivals, traveled four deep at
the quarter pole, got floated out into the lane and lacked a rally. FLEET BROTATO was off a bit slow and dropped back under coaxing, passed a rival on the
turn, came three wide into the drive and failed to menace. BILLY JOE SHAVER broke a step slow, raced greenly with some awkward steps up the
backstretch, eased around the turn and down the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
AURELIAN MAN stalked the pace from inside, angled out at the five-sixteenths pole to take aim three wide leaving the bend, drew alongside THIRTY FOUR
COUPE and battled down the stretch, dug in late and edged away from the runner-up. THIRTY FOUR COUPE pressed the pace from outside, gained the
advantage late on the far turn, put away inner rival then fought with AURELIAN MAN through the lane and yielded grudgingly late. NUMERO DIX (GB)
settled in the three path, rounded the far turn two wide, moved out in stretch and gained the show. BROTHER REID traveled two wide at the back early,
remained in that path on the far turn, kept on through the drive and rounded out the superfecta. WORKDAY took control from inside, set the pace under
pressure, was overtaken late on the far turn and weakened in the lane. BEAR MOUNTAIN stalked the top pair from outside in the three path, got floated out
to the four path at the five-sixteenths pole and faded in the stretch run. ROAD OF LOVE tracked four deep into the clubhouse turn, ridden along three to four
wide on the second bend and lacked a rally. DEVELOPING THE WAY moved to the inside racing near the back, ridden along on the far turn and failed to
make an impact. THEMAINPROTAGONIST (IRE) broke a step slow and was coaxed along but then started to pull shortly after, chased in the two path
around the clubhouse turn out of range, moved inside on the second bend and weakened.

Footnotes
KIRSTENBOSCH was off slow to begin, chased from off the pace up the backstretch, made progress along the rail then angled out leaving the bend, closed
in rapidly from outside, reeled in the leader past the sixteenth pole and drove clear. CLEARLY UNHINGED vied for the lead from inside, inched ahead on
the turn, shook free at the top of the lane, remained clear to midstretch but could not offer any resistance to the winner in the final sixteenth. EDA pressed
the pace four deep up the backstretch, chased the leaders four to three wide around the bend, raced within striking distance in the final furlong but could not
summon the needed late kick. ELM DRIVE vied three deep up the backstretch and around the turn, fought outside the leader leaving the bend, could not go
on with CLEARLY UNHINGED in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. VIOLENT RUNNER raced up close five deep to the turn, angled down
to the three path around the bend, got floated out into the drive and weakened. LADY T trailed five wide into and around the bend and could not make an
impact. HOME COOKING challenged for command between foes to the quarter pole and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BELMONT BILL showed speed between rivals then ceded command on the clubhouse turn, stalked the leading pair along the inside into the far turn, lacked
room into the stretch, tipped out into the clear, reached the front midstretch and kicked clear under hand urging. CAPTAIN CHOOCHIES bumped in the
beginning, pressed the pace from outside, drifted inward while battling with inner rival in upper stretch, could not match BELMONT BILL in deep stretch and
stayed on to save second. CRYPTO MAN tracked the pace from inside, found traffic behind rivals, altered out in upper stretch, finished well and missed the
place. QUINTECENTS away quickly to take the front, set the pace under pressure, maintained a short lead over CAPTAIN CHOOCHIES through the far
turn and into the lane, resisted into the final furlong, relinquished the lead midstretch and weakened. NO SECRET settled a bit off the rail then moved inside,
cut the corner into the lane and improved position. TOKAMAK broke out and bumped rival, checked into the first turn, raced outside a rival then between in
the middle stages, rounded the far turn three then two wide, ran into traffic briefly at the three-sixteenths pole and could not threaten. AUTOLINE (IRE) got
bumped on both sides at the start, chased four wide into the clubhouse turn, steered out briefly then moved back in a few paths to race three wide, got
crowded between rivals into the far turn, rounded the far turn three wide and lacked a rally. SIX MAGPIES (IRE) reserved early on then began to pull and
had to steered out from behind rivals on the clubhouse turn, was on the move four then three wide on the second bend but flattened out in the stretch run.
CHURCHMEISTER unhurried in the beginning and tucked inside, was a bit rank on the backstretch, continued along the rail into the far turn, encountered
some mild traffic in the lane and could not rally. CHIEFS BLANKET chased three then two wide on the clubhouse turn, lost positions still in the two path on
the second bend, moved out in the drive and weakened. BOLTS DESTINY broke a step slow, raced four wide into the clubhouse turn, traveled outside a
rival or two wide on the second bend and was not a factor.
