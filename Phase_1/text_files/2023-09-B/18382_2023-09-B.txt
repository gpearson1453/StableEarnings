Footnotes
HERE KITTY KITTY stalked the pace to the turn, swept up three wide at the quarter pole to take command at the head of the lane and draw away as much
best. JANE'S A DIVA broke alertly to lead from the gate, set a pressured pace to the top of the stretch and finished gamely to hold second. DABNEY
bumped at the start, moved up from two wide early to press the pace, moved clear of the inside rival into the turn to duel on the lead from the rail to upper
stretch and kept on to the wire only to miss the place. ABRA ABRA reserved off the early pace, rallied midway on the turn while circling wide and finished
with a late bid. GOODY FOUR SHOES broke inward bumping and crowding rivals, dropped to the rear of the field to trail to upper stretch and showed some
late interest along the rail down the lane. ANTE ANGEL rushed up the inside to be prominent nearing the turn, took back entering the turn and finished as
no threat. SANTIVA DIVA squeezed between rivals leaving the gate, flashed speed from between rivals through the turn and faded.

AMAZING GAL pressed the pace for the first half mile, assumed command into the far turn, opened a clear advantage and finished unchallenged. SECOND
EXCHANGE tracked the leaders from the rail for the first half, dropped back losing position into the turn, circled four wide while being asked leaving the
three-eighths pole and finished willingly to be gaining through the lane. ELUSIVE JUSTICE trailed early, ranged up three wide down the backside to chase
the leader though the turn and flattened out in the lane. TIMELESS GLORY went one-paced as no threat throughout. NATIVE LION flashed speed for a half
mile to duel on the lead from the rail and came up empty.

KING OF KENTUCKY broke alertly, settled in hand to be in striking distance of the pacesetter through the turn, rallied in upper stretch to take command and
finished convincingly. RUFFLED WATERS reserved off the pace in the early going, steadily gained ground along the rail into the turn, tipped out turning for
home and closed well down the lane. OTIS ON THE CAPE hustled early to take the lead, opened a clear advantage to the head of the lane and finished
evenly. ETERNAL BLISS stalked the pace from the fence in a clear pocket and failed to gain ground. BE RUTHLESS unhurried early, saved ground in the
turn and mounted a mild bid along the rail down the stretch. INFINITY'S WARRIOR tracked the pace from two wide and lacked a response when called
upon. TOTALITARIAN was never a threat. FEELINGOODBILLYRAY well placed off the leaders in striking distance and lacked a bid. BOXSTER was never
a factor.

E Z AVENUE sped to the lead, opened a clear advantage into the turn and finished well having never been threatened. SALTY SUE stalked the pace
through the turn and made a mild bid in the lane. DISHIN' IT OUT unhurried in the early to be at the back of the field and rallied well in the stretch belatedly.
LUCKY LINDA W reserved in hand towards the back of the pack and rallied coming home just missing the show. DEPUTY STAR well placed along the rail
saving ground and failed to menace. KAYS HEAVENLY STAR tracked the leaders and lacked a response. ECHO DREAMER moved up three wide down
the backstretch to chase the leaders and flattened out. WIRY prompted the pace through the far turn and tired. FANCY GRANCY was never a threat.

LIQUID ADDICTION (IRE) saved ground in striking position along the fence while waiting patiently, rallied in the turn while tipping out to engage the
pacesetter in upper stretch and finished in a determined drive. NEWS AT NINE sped to the lead up the rail into the first turn, opened a clear lead, settled to
rate down the backside, widened again into the far turn and held well through the lane while unable to hold off the winner. HILTON HEAD tracked the leader
from three wide through the final bend and failed to mount a closing rally. MOON WISH reserved well off the pace, circled at the head of the lane and
finished with good energy to gain the minor placing. JOINT VENTURE settled off the pace down the backside, rallied up the rail to make a bid in mid-stretch
and finished evenly. AUGUSTUS BLUE dropped back through the field to be near the rear down the backside, and rallied belatedly between rival in the
stretch. NIGHT CHANT trailed for the first half mile and passed tiring rivals in the lane. CHANNEL Z stalked the pace from three wide through the far turn
and weakened late in the drive. RED FIVE rated in mid-pack for three quarters and faded with out rally in the stretch. CREPE YARNS was never a threat.
CENTAURO prompted the pace from two wide to the head of the lane and tired.

Footnotes
ILLUSIVE STAR pressed the pace into the turn from two wide, dueled turning for home with the pacesetter to mid-stretch and pulled away nearing the wire.
LINGONBERRY sped to the lead down the backstretch, responded when challenged turning for home, dueled down the lane and was out-finished in deep
stretch. SAKURA SKY unhurried in the early going, rallied from between horses through the turn and finished willingly. DIXIE RAG trailed to the quarter pole
and mounted a mild late gain down the stretch. MIDNIGHT ANGEL raced mid-pack from three wide down the backstretch, rallied to midway down the lane
and finished evenly. PERFECT MANHATTAN stalked the pace through the turn and weakened coming home. THIRSTY ACCOUNTANT was never a threat.
PAGEANT PURRFECT well placed for the first half mile and faded. TIZ MIZ PARADISE showed speed in the first turn and was through early.

Footnotes
I'M SO SORRY unhurried in the early going while taken in hand to settle at the back of the field, circled six wide in the far turn when called upon, took
command in upper stretch and drew away handily down the lane. SAKE (FR) rated just off the leader down the backside, moved to the lead just leaving the
quarter pole, opened a clear advantage briefly and was overhauled by the winner despite finishing willingly to be second best. MINT EDITION settled near
the back of the field, mounted a rally from between horses on the far turn, worked through rivals to the inside and finished with good late energy. STAR
WISHER stalked the pace from between rivals to be prominent turning for home and finished evenly. BEYOND DOUBT reserved well off the pace to the
final bend and circled wide with a late gain. HARVEY'S PRINCESS made an early bid down the backside and flattened out in the turn. GIO'S BABY GIRL
rated in mid-pack to the turn while between horses and failed to mount a rally. DICHOTOMY sped to the lead into the first turn, set a pressured pace for a
half mile and gradually gave way. POND WALKER (GB) raced up three wide in the first turn to move to the leader, took the lead down the backside on a
clear lead, was challenged into the final bend and tired coming home. APRIL'S GEM stalked the pace from four wide to the far turn and came up empty.
RITAAN chased from three wide through the far turn and weakened turning for home.
