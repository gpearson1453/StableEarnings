CLASS CLOWN sped clear quickly, led two wide into the turn then moved to the rail, roused in upper stretch, drew away from SORBET and was in hand
nearing the wire. SORBET hopped a bit at the start, chased five deep into the turn, steered to the three path around the bend, closest in pursuit entering the
final furlong but was no match for the winner. CON SEAL AND KERRY chased three deep early, took aim three then two wide around the bend but
weakened in the stretch run. MOONLIT MISCHIEF chased between foes, had to take up at the seven-sixteenths pole, angled out in the lane and flattened
out. BAD CARDINAL chased along the inside to the stretch and faded. SUPER ANNIE chased four wide into the turn, four to five wide into the lane and
weakened.

Footnotes
COLONEL VARGO pressed from outside, fought four wide into the lane, battled head to head with OTRO MAS through the lane and was all to edged the
runner-up. OTRO MAS set the pace under pressure from outer rival, led two then three wide around the bend, dueled with the winner through the stretch
and finished gamely in defeat. ACQUIRED CLASS chased off the inside then steered out wider early on, chased four wide around the turn, five wide into the
stretch, stayed within striking distance into the final furlong and gained late from outside. TOO MUCH INFO settled off the pace, saved ground through the
turn, moved out in upper stretch and needed to find more to threaten. STRENGTH OF AUTISM stalked the speed from inside through the turn and
weakened in the lane. SAN JAC sat off the pace early on, went two then three wide on the turn and lacked a rally.

DORIE MILLER broke out and brushed rival, stalked the leader up the backstretch, drew alongside approaching the three-eighths pole, quickly took over
and clear two then three wide, widened when roused in the lane and was ridden out to the wire. PURA VIDA broke a step slow, chased out of range to the
turn, rounded the bend four wide, summoned a mild response and finished a clear second. LOVME LIKEAFOOL chased two wide through the turn, lacked a
bid to threaten in the furlong grounds but churned on for the show honors. FIFTY STARS sent clear to establish command, challenged early on the turn, lost
command midway around the bend and retreated in the lane. JOSIE EARP hit the gate and got brushed at the start, chased three wide into the turn,
dropped back between rivals around the bend, coaxed to the eighth pole then eased in the final furlong and walked off.

CLASSYMADEMOISELLE raced up close off the inside, challenged PROFESSORS' PRIDE from outside on the turn, took over at the three-sixteenths pole,
put away inner rival past the eighth pole, led clear into the final sixteenth and held late over the runner-up. SHARED FUTURE stalked wide early, angled
down to the three path nearing the turn, came four wide into the stretch, rallied in deep stretch but was too late. PROFESSORS' PRIDE set the pace to the
turn, challenged by the winner around the bend, maintained a short lead into the stretch, lost command at the three-sixteenths pole, flattened late but
managed to save the show. ON PURPOSE stalked from inside, tipped out in upper stretch and missed the show. AMERICAN HEIGHTS got brushed by
trouble rival leaving the gate, chased off the rail, asked three wide around the bend and weakened. SUGAR SUGAR hopped and lost the rider at the start
and walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START OF SUGAR SUGAR AND RULED THAT SHE CAUSED HER OWN
PROBLEMS AT THE START AND IS CONSIDERED A STARTER.

Footnotes
BIG CHEDDAR was closest in pursuit of the pacesetter early, drew alongside around the turn, cleared in upper stretch and held well under a drive to the
wire. AROUND THE DIAL raced three deep into the turn, ridden along four wide into the drive, loomed entering the final furlong but could not summon the
needed late kick. WHOA BUDDY chased four deep at the back entering the turn, came six wide into the lane, chased within striking distance with a furlong
remaining but finished evenly late. PERFECTO AMOR tracked the pace from inside, cut the corner into the stretch, moved out a bit in the drive and lacked
the needed response. BOOMER JUSTICE stumbled leaving the gate, chased two wide around the bend between rivals and could not rally. DIVINELY
DIVERSE stepped to the front and showed the way up the backstretch, set the pace along the inside through the turn, yielded to the winner at the top of the
lane and faded out of contention.

CONFUCIUS broke out and bumped rival at the start, stalked near the inside then two wide on the first turn, waited for room behind the leaders around the
far turn, altered in leaving the bend, reached the front approaching the three-sixteenths pole and edged away to prove best. WHISKEY VISION chased in
the two path, moved out on the backstretch, bid four then five wide on the far turn, gained the advantage in upper stretch, relinquished the lead to
CONFUCIUS shortly after and stayed on to secure the place. L L L COOL vied between rivals for the lead in the two path to the far turn, fought three wide
into the lane and was outfinished in the final furlong. DONTTESTYOURLUCK chased in the four path early, remained wide and came six wide into the lane
and lacked a bid. PAT CAN'T COUNT vied three deep to the far turn, four wide into the lane, got crowded between rivals in upper stretch and weakened.
NON TOXIC bumped and stumbled leaving the gate, trailed three then four wide early, moved outside rivals in the middle stages, traveled four then five
wide at the back on the far turn and was eased in the final furlong. KING HEAT vied for the the lead from inside to the stretch, weakened in the lane, then
lugged into the temporary rail approaching the eighth pole, losing the rider in the process and walked off following the race.

KINGDOM HEART sprinted clear from inside, drifted into the lane, drifted out further in the drive, kept to task in the final furlong and was never challenged.
VANCOUGAR stumbled leaving the gate, tracked widest to the turn, went five then six wide around the bend, drifted in and brushed midstretch and
outkicked SMUGGLER'S RUN for second. SMUGGLER'S RUN brushed with COOL PAPA G in the beginning, closest three wide into the turn, spun five
wide into the drive, got brushed by VANCOUGAR midstretch and was edged by that rival for second. COOL PAPA G brushed with inner rival at the start,
chased on the inside into the turn, eased off the rail around the bend and lacked a bid. AMBIVALENT chased two to three wide through the turn and could
not rally. JACK SIXPACK broke a step slow, got crowded between rivals early and altered to the inside, saved ground around the bend and failed to
menace. RESILIENT chased four wide into the turn, five wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
RELAXED ARTIST (IRE) broke in and bumped then lost his path at the start, trailed two wide into the turn, eased out around the bend, closed in steadily
through the lane and dug in to get up in the closing moments. THIRSTY veered in at the start, sped clear and showed the way up the backstretch, led a bit
off the rail through the turn, drifted into the lane, resisted into the final sixteenth and was nailed at the wire. TANGLEDUPINGREY chased off the rail, bid
from outside into the turn, got floated out into the lane, continued to challenge into the final furlong and never could find the needed late kick. HEY BATMAN
forwardly placed early on, went two wide around the bend, bid from inside in the final furlong and got outkicked. SPIRITIST got bumped on both sides at the
start, chased three wide into the turn, angled six wide, moved out further and put in a mild rally while widest. ABERDEEN'S KNIGHT forwardly placed in the
early stages, chased four wide into the drive and flattened. RIPPIN' RUIS (AUS) got bumped in the beginning and crowded shortly after, altered to the
inside, saved ground through the turn and failed to menace. HOT MEMORIES tracked in the two path through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
ARHAM rated two to three wide around the clubhouse turn, closest in pursuit up the backstretch, challenged into the far turn, headed IT'S MY HOUSE at the
three-eighths pole, inched ahead around the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and was ridden out in the final furlong. AMERICAN ADMIRAL stalked in the
two path outside a rival, went three wide into the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, finished willingly outside SALESMAN (IRE) in the late stages and
edged that rival for second. SALESMAN (IRE) broke well then took a stalking position along the inside, ridden along while tipping to the two path on the far
turn, moved out in the lane and got outkicked by AMERICAN ADMIRAL for the place honors. IT'S MY HOUSE cleared and crossed over to the inside,
showed the way up the backstretch, challenged from outside into the far turn, headed with three furlongs left to run, relinquished the lead soon after and
weakened down the lane.
