Footnotes
TAM'S TIME settled just off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, was well positioned through the backstretch run and gained ground at the
half-mile pole, saved all of the ground while within striking distance into the far turn, tipped two wide into upper stretch, responded to urging inside of the
furlong pole, caught RESPOND in deep stretch and held in a drive at the finish to prevail. RESPOND was sent after an alert beginning and dictated terms
into the first turn, set moderate fractions while prompted into the backstretch run, contested the pace with ITS THIEVERY to the far turn, took a narrow lead
on that rival and set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, shook free into upper stretch and was set down at the furlong grounds, was overtaken by
TAM'S TIME inside of the sixteenth-marker and was outfinished, while just holding for second. DUPLICATION was away a step slowly at the start and
settled outside of rivals in the early stages, raced widest along the first turn and came four wide into the backstretch run, improved position and was well
placed heading to the half-mile marker, was steered two wide into the far turn, raced between rivals to the quarter marker, angled to the four path into upper
stretch, closed well in the final stages and just missed for second. LOOKOUT POINT settled off of the moderate early pace, raced outside of runners along
the first turn and came three wide into the backstretch run, improved position and stalked the pace to the half-mile marker, was coaxed along three wide to
the quarter marker, swung five wide into the stretch, was gaining in deep stretch but was outkicked by the top three. ITS THIEVERY was prominent in the
run into the first turn, attended to the moderate early pace into the backstretch run, contested the pace with RESPOND to the half-mile marker, pressed
between runners along the far turn, came three wide into the lane and lost position approaching the furlong pole, could not keep pace into deep stretch and
weakened.

CHIPPEWA BUD was forwardly placed in the early running and chased the solid pace from the inside into the turn, waited a bit for racing room while saving
ground approaching the quarter marker, found a seam in upper stretch and was asked for run heading to the furlong pole, responded to firm urging into
deep stretch, took command at the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in the late stages to prevail. MY BUCKET LIST bobbled then took up at the start and
was off slowly, settled at the rear in the early stages, improved position three wide on the turn, mounted a four wide rally into the stretch, was outkicked in
the final sixteenth by CHIPPEWA BUD and ran on in deep stretch to secure second. JOHNNY PAYCHECK broke alertly, conceded the early lead and
tracked outside of rivals into the turn, gained ground three wide along the turn and pressed APPLE WARRIOR to the quarter marker, took command into
upper stretch and was set down at the furlong pole, was overtaken by CHIPPEWA BUD nearing the sixteenth-pole, could not keep pace with the top two
into deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while holding safely for third. COUNTRY BOY chased the solid early pace, came two wide into the turn,
was coaxed along five wide into the stretch, needed more in the final stages and finished evenly in the final furlong. APPLE WARRIOR was hustled to
establish the early lead and set a solid pace into the turn, carved out quick fractions from the rail while pressed to the quarter marker, drifted out in upper
stretch and was overtaken at the three-sixteenths, chased the leaders to the furlong marker and gave way. JAIME'S COMMITMENT raced close to the solid
early pace, chased two wide and between runners along the turn, lost position into the stretch and tired.

MIRACLE FIRE showed speed leaving the break, assumed command in the early stages and set a fast pace into the turn, was pressed to the quarter
marker while carving quick fractions, shook free into the stretch, drifted out while a bit green at mid-stretch, recovered and was kept to task to the
sixteenth-marker, felt a bit of late pressure from the runner-up and held in a drive at the finish. SATELLITE HEART was bumped at the start and raced a bit
in traffic in the early running, was guided to the inside and stalked the solid pace into the turn, gained ground heading to the quarter marker and swung four
wide for the stretch drive, rallied inside of the furlong pole, put a bit of late pressure on the winner and was up in the final strides to claim second. KRISTIN
LEE broke alertly, took back off of the fast early pace and tracked three wide into the turn, advanced along the bend and pressed the solid pace to the
quarter pole while three wide, lost a bit of ground into the stretch and chased MIRACLE FIRE to the furlong marker, needed more in deep stretch and was
just edged for second in the final strides, while holding clearly for third. OUTER SUNSET was unhurried in the early going, chased the solid pace along the
turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, swung to the six path into the stretch, was not able to impact the top three but showed good late interest in
the final stages. I'M TELLING MOM was prominent leaving the break and pressed the fast early pace, pressed two wide between rivals along the turn, lost
position into upper stretch and was coaxed along three wide into the drive, chased the leaders to mid-stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
MYSTIC ENCOUNTER broke alertly, took back off of the fast early pace and tracked outside of rivals heading to the half-mile marker, advanced three wide
on the turn and pressed the pace to the quarter marker, took command in upper stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, was kept to task
under steady urging approaching the sixteenth-pole, drew off in deep stretch and was hand ridden to the finish to prevail in an impressive debut. SOO
BROOKLYN rated off of the solid early pace, improved position along the turn and raced three wide to the quarter marker, was roused four wide into the
stretch and ran evenly to the furlong grounds, was not able to impact the winner in the final stages but stayed on in deep stretch and got up in the final
strides for second. ZOE'S PRIDE was a bit slow into stride leaving the start, rushed into contention at the half-mile marker and stalked the solid early pace
into the turn, was guided to the rail along the bend, came in tight while blocked behind rivals approaching the quarter marker, tipped two wide into the
stretch, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth, was outfinished in deep stretch for the place and was well clear in the end for the show.
JUST SERENE lacked early speed and was a bit green away from the start, trailed into the turn, saved ground along the bend, swung five wide into the
stretch, was not able to threaten the leaders in the final stages and passed tiring rivals at the finish. RHONDA'S COOKIN was prominent leaving the start
and pressed the solid early pace while outside of SMILIN RUBY, pressed between runners while two wide heading to the quarter marker, lost position
approaching the top of the stretch and raced four wide into the drive, was outrun to the furlong pole and came up empty in the late stages. SMILIN RUBY
was sent leaving the break and set a pressured pace into the turn, carved out fast fractions from the rail while pressed to the quarter pole, lost the lead in
upper stretch, chased to the furlong marker and gave way. SOUTHERN BLESSING was forwardly placed in the early running and tracked the solid pace
from the inside, was outrun into the turn, trailed into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
PRIMROSE RIDGE (GB) settled just behind the pacesetter while saving ground, bided time through the turn, tipped out to the two path for the stretch run,
responded to a brisk hand ride down the lane and was up in time. SMILING MOLLY broke sharply, set out for the lead then cleared the field by a length,
held through the turn with PRIMROSE RIDGE (GB) and GENTLE JULIA in hot pursuit, responded when set down for the stretch run, dug in gamely but was
outfinished in the last jumps. GOLDEN PRAYER broke well and was up on the pace through the early stages, made a three wide run at SMILING MOLLY
near the quarter pole, had that bid repelled but kept on racing to the outside of the three horse duel down the stretch and was out-nodded for the place.
CANAM GAL was sent from the gate then backed off the developing speed duel, settled in a tracking spot well behind the trio that broke away from the pack
through the turn, came into the stretch three wide then rallied but could not make up the needed ground. LITTLE LILIANA was hustled from the gate but was
outsprinted to the turn, had to steady hard near the three-eighths marker, was able to regroup and attempted to rally four wide into the stretch, ran on but
could not improve position. SKY MAKER outrun from the break, tried to make a four-wide rally through the turn that went nowhere, dove to the rail for the
stretch run but could not make an impact. GENTLE JULIA raced up close through the early stages, steadied inside at the three-eighths pole, could not
recover and dropped back.

Footnotes
BELLEO'S FOREST was forwardly placed into the first turn and stalked the pace while three wide, stalked the decent fractions along the backstretch run
and advanced nearing the half-mile marker, mounted a three wide bid at the quarter pole, lost a bit of ground into the stretch and chased LA VIKINA to the
furlong marker, closed determinedly into deep stretch, vied between rivals in the final yards and gamely won the nod on the wire to prevail. CAROLE
LOMBARD settled outside of rivals into the first turn, made a steady advance through the backstretch run and continued that gain while three wide into the
far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong grounds, responded to urging into the final sixteenth, rallied in deep stretch and
just missed for the win at the wire, while winning the nod for the place. LA VIKINA hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered in the early
stages and assumed command into the first turn, set decent fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, was well handled into the far turn and
showed the way to the quarter marker, drew to a clear lead into the stretch, kept to task under firm urging to the sixteenth-marker, was all out to hold off
oncoming rivals in the final yards and was nailed on the wire for the win and place, while well clear for the show. WESTWARD BREEZE showed early speed
and was prominent into the first turn, attended to the decent pace into the backstretch run and prompted the pacesetter to the half-mile marker, kept close
attendance to the quarter pole, lost position into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. EM N HOLL'S FIESTA stalked the early pace from the inside,
saved all of the ground while well positioned through the backstretch run, chased from the inside heading to the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch
and lacked a late rally. VRONSKY FEINT settled off of the early pace and raced outside of rivals into the first turn, was widest into the backstretch run and
improved position heading to the half-mile marker, continued that gain while four wide along the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, could not sustain
her bid into the final furlong and flattened out. HARBOR ABBEY settled in the second flight while saving ground early on, saved ground while never far back
through the backstretch run, lost position along the far turn and gave way in the stretch. PANDEMIC GIRL broke a bit slowly away from the start and was
unhurried in the early running, saved ground into the first turn, trailed through the backstretch run, swung to the four path into upper stretch and did not have
an impact in the drive.

Footnotes
KENNEBEC rated nicely off of the contentious early pace and was well positioned into the first turn, tracked the solid pace from the inside through the
backstretch run, saved all of the ground to the second turn, angled three wide into upper stretch, was given his cue and vied for the lead at the furlong
grounds, took command nearing the sixteenth-pole and drew away under firm hand urging in the final stages. NOLDE took back off of the solid early pace
and saved ground into the first turn, settled inside of a rival into the backstretch run and made a mild gain at the half-mile pole, saved all of the ground into
the far turn and continued to gain approaching the quarter marker, loomed into upper stretch, came in very tight nearing the furlong marker, attempted to
split horses and jostled two rivals, found room into deep stretch and was outkicked in the final sixteenth while besting the rest. KINGMEISTER was
prominent early on and disputed the pace into the first turn, prompted the solid pace through the backstretch run, dueled with DULAS into the second turn,
continued to duel with that rival into the stretch, was jostled at the furlong marker when NOLDE attempted to split horses, weakened into deep stretch and
just held for third at the finish. BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) stalked the solid early pace while two wide and between runners, maintained a two wide trip while
between horses heading to the half-mile marker, checked in tight quarters midway through the second turn and lost ground heading to the quarter pole, ran
evenly to mid-stretch, finished evenly in the final furlong and just missed for third. DULAS (IRE) broke alertly and assumed command in the early stages, set
solid fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, dueled with KINGMEISTER into the far turn, continued that duel into the stretch, was jostled at
the furlong marker when NOLDE attempted to split horses and tired into deep stretch. CONUNDRUM was forwardly placed in the early stages and stalked
the solid pace while three wide into the first turn, gained ground along the backstretch run, lost a bit of position while three then four wide along the far turn,
ran evenly to the furlong marker and lacked a rally in deep stretch. HARMON was squeezed at the start and was away slowly, settled off of the solid early
pace and raced outside of rivals into the backstretch, gained ground approaching the half-mile marker, came four wide into the far turn, lost position at the
quarter pole, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a response in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
WINTER FALCON broke well but was unhurried, settled behind the pace in the early going then pulled into the mix going into the turn, became boxed in
from the half mile pole through the turn, awaited room then found a seam four wide into the lane then produced a bold rally down the stretch to get up in the
shadow of the wire. STRETCH RUN broke sharply then veered out at the start, cleared the field by the seven-sixteenths marker and angled towards the rail,
opened up through the turn, ran on well under intermittent urging but was caught in the final yards while well clear of the third horse. BANDERA AZTECA
settled early, stayed out in the clear in the three path, moved up three wide through the turn to join STARSHIP CHEWBACCA and LITTLE CASINO all
chasing STRETCH RUN into the lane, ran on and finished clear of the next horse but was not able to pose a threat to the top pair. HANDSOME GARY
hopped at the start, then settled near the back of the compact field, raced three wide through the turn and into the stretch and made some mild improvement
in the final furlong. LITTLE CASINO broke well and stalked the early pacesetter in tandem with STARSHIP CHEWBACCA, came into the stretch with every
chance but was unable to keep pace with a furlong to run. STARSHIP CHEWBACCA broke well and took up the chase behind STRETCH RUN to the far
turn, got a dream trip up the rail and loomed a threat at the top of stretch then weakened approaching the final furlong. LESSONS OF AUTISM lagged near
the back of the back, raced four wide through the turn being kept wide by HANDSOME GARY to the inside, emerged five wide into the stretch and chased
the field to the wire. GREAT STORY came away well then lost action just past the five furlong pole, pulled up and was vanned off.
