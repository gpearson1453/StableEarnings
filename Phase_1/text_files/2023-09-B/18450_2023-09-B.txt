Footnotes
COURAGEOUS COPPER dueled at the rail to upper stretch and drew off while ridden out. BADBADBOBBY was off a step slow, raced off the pace in the
two path and rallied for the place. ACAMAR saved ground in range, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on well enough to save
the show. ON JET HEIR raced off the pace three wide, swung six wide turning for home, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally.
TEJOTA chased the pace four wide and faded through the stretch. STEALTHTHIRTYFOUR was a bit reluctant to load, stalked the duel three wide and
came up empty in the lane. PAPA KATZ was outrun inside. BIG BALLOONS dueled outside of the winner to upper stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
SINGING SANDRA tracked in the three path, bid early into the far turn, ran on while being carried outward in duel with the inner pacesetter passing the
eighth pole, and inched ahead while continuing to drift out in the final strides to win. BONMATI bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the two
path, was under coaxing when challenged by an outer foe early into the far turn, dug in to duel with that foe while drifting out through the lane, but faded in
the closing stages to place. GOATS ON A TREE bumped at the start with an outer foe, rated along the inside around the first turn before tipping out to the
three path early down the backstretch, was ridden in the four path around the far turn, got floated out to the center down the lane, and kept on for show.
FUMBLEROOSKI stalked in the two path, was stymied nearing the three-eighths point, but did not threaten.

Footnotes
THANK THE ACADEMY settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced between foes around the far turn, angled to the rail near the quarter
pole, closed inside and was up late. TESHIMA broke outwardly and bumped foes at the start, sped to the front, set the pace in the two path and led until
deep stretch. BULLET VALENTINA saved ground off the pace and was along for the show. FAR ABOVE tracked the pace three and four wide and was
one-paced through the lane. OVERRUN chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. ESKIMO STREET stalked the pace two and three wide,
continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. ALWAYS CONNECTED was bumped between foes at the start, saved ground and failed to menace.
SONG AND TAP was soundly bumped at the start and was never in contention while racing three and four wide. HUGE G was bumped between foes at the
start, became rank soon after, saved ground and had no response. MYSTICAL LADY was outrun outside.

Footnotes
ROUGH ENTRY set the pace in the two path, was challenged by outer foes from along the rail rounding the turn and headed passing the quarter, dug in
while floating out to the five path passing the eighth pole, and held on gamely under left handed encouragement. MISTER KELLY pressed in the three path,
bid early around the turn, headed the inner pacesetter from the two path passing the quarter, shifted out to the six path into the stretch, and ran on, but was
repelled to place. SIR OLLIE brushed with an inner rival at the start, prompted the pace in the four path, bid between foes while under a ride in the three
path approaching the quarter, swung out to the seven path into the lane, and kept on to hold show. THE DISTRACTOR was a bit fractious in the gate, then
brushed on both sides at the start, rated in the five path, ranged up under rousing approaching the quarter, fanned out to the eight path into the stretch, but
was one-paced. GANGLY chased in the six path but made no impact outside of foes down the center in the stretch. RARE JEWEL brushed with an outer
foe at the start and trailed throughout from the five to eight paths.

AMOR Y CONTROL stalked the pace in the four path, took over near the five-sixteenths marker, kicked clear soon after, drifted further out under
right-handed urging in the lane and widened. EXTRA INDY was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, swung four wide near the quarter pole and
ran on for the place. MACASSA raced off the pace two wide, made some progress in upper stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. VAL'S GAL raced up
close at the rail and weakened in the drive. SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide and never threatened. INTO
TOURING had her head turned at the start then was bumped just after, raced five wide and never menaced. TOVIA broke inwardly and bumped at the start,
chased the pace three wide and faltered in the lane. EILAT set the pace along the rail and retreated through the lane. GINRIN played no factor while racing
four wide.

BIG AND CLASSY prompted the pace outside the leader in the four path, was cued to bid from the three path midway around the turn, took the lead under
right handed encouragement into the stretch, and drew away from an outer challenger in the final furlong. AVANT GLORY tracked in the three path, ranged
up under coaxing from the four path around the turn, bid under right handed urging turning into the lane, and kept on, but was second best. ZYDECEAUX
stalked inside of foes, was nudged along from the rail rounding the turn, angled out to the five path in upper stretch, and finished evenly while still on his left
lead for show. CAJUN'S MAGIC trailed in the six path, was driven from said position around the turn, but made no impact while drifting out in the stretch.
WARRIOR'S PRIDE set the pace in the two path but gaveway turning into the lane. STARSHIP RENEGADE chased in the five path but weakened going
into the stretch.

SAINT NO MORE dueled inside of a foe in the two path, shook clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. HE'S A COMMISIONER lacked early
speed, saved ground throughout and rallied at the rail to gain the place. LACE UP chased the pace four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, could
not match strides in upper stretch but kept on to regain the show late. CADRON SETTLEMENT dueled outside of the winner while racing in the three path
and weakened in stretch. KINSMAN REDEEMER chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. SALVATTORE PRINCE failed to menace while racing
four wide. STELLAR DREAM had brief speed five wide. VINSANITY broke outwardly, raced two wide and made little impact. AWE SUMSUNFUN trailed in
the three path.

Footnotes
DEMOGORGON pulled while setting the pace from inside into the backstretch, was challenged while along the rail around the far turn, opened up slightly
while drifting out in the stretch, began to shorten stride in the final sixteenth, but held safe. STARSHIP AGENDA chased in the two path, was coaxed into
the far turn, floated out to the seven path entering the stretch, and rallied for place. LOVE HER LOTS tracked inside, was roused in the two path early
around the far turn, lugged out to the seven path passing the eighth pole, and kept on for show. FLYING BLACK stalked in the four path but was one-paced.
LUCKY PERIDOT turned her head as the gates opened, raced off the pace in the five path and made no impact from out in the nine path down the lane.
HIHELLOHOWAREYOU prompted the pace in the two path, bid in the three path rounding the far turn, swung out to the four path into the stretch, but faded
in the final furlong. MARIA'S REVENGE was behind in the three path down the backside, fanned out around the ten path going into the stretch, and did not
threaten.

Footnotes
CASHIER CHECK set the pace in the two path, responded when challenged around the far turn and edged clear under a drive in the lane. UNO TIGER was
bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide and finished willingly to gain the place late. SIGRUN FAST BOY stalked the winner in the three path,
shifted in slightly and steadied off that foes heels nearing the sixteenth pole and was outfinished. YOU TALKIN TO ME was up close inside and was
one-paced through the lane. KARTANO raced in range three and four wide and lacked a rally. STRIDE was outrun while racing two and three wide. AMBOR
NIGHT broke a bit awkwardly, steadied entering the first turn, trailed inside early, advanced five wide around the far turn but came up empty in the lane. AN
OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF SIGRUN FAST BOY AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT
ALLOWED.

LOCO ABARRIO prompted the pace in the four path, bid in the three path passing the three eighths pole, led while tipping out to the five path into the lane,
and drew clear handily. X Y POINT set the pace in the two path, was challenged by an outer pair while along the rail early into the turn, lost touch with the
winner from the three path in upper stretch, but held on to place. DESERT RULER chased in the three path, was coaxed early around the turn, swung out to
the seven path into the stretch, and kept on for show. AWESOME FLAY hopped at the start, raced off the pace in the six path, angled inwards leaving the
turn, and stayed on from the two path down the lane. SENSEI LAWRENCE pressed in the three path, was ridden between foes in the two path passing the
three eighths, floated out to the six path into the stretch, and evened out on his left lead. ROD TWO ROD trailed in the three path and made no impact
around the five path in the stretch. PURE SPEIGHT rated in the five path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but did not threaten.
MAPTITUDE stalked inside but backed up early into the turn.

Footnotes
STRAIGHT SHOT stalked the pace in the three path, reached near even terms outside of UNPRECEDENTED in upper stretch, dueled through the lane
while exchanging several brushes and narrowly prevailed. UNPRECEDENTED was bumped soon after the start, set the pace in the two path, dueled inside
of the winner while exchanging several brushes and just missed in a game try. SKIPPERINI threw his head at the start, raced off the pace two wide and ran
on for the show. BARONE CESCO raced off the pace four wide and improved position in the lane. URANIUM chased the pace four wide and lacked a
closing bid. ALMASHRIQ was bumped soon after the start, saved ground off the pace and never threatened. ELUSIVE MISCHIEF chased the pace inside
and came up empty in the lane. FORTY FLASH had early speed three wide and steadily faded.
