Footnotes
ROCK CITY ROCKET tracked the top pair along the inside into the turn, tipped two wide heading into upper stretch, edged up closer then given cue at the
eighth pole, reached the leader in deep stretch and edged away. LANGUAGE BARRIER broke out at the start and sped to the lead, set the pace and held
clear around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, sustained bid along the inside and failed to hold off the winner in final stages. BARSTOW got pushed
out a couple paths at the start and raced off the early leaders, picked up the pace three wide around the turn, swung four paths wide into upper stretch and
ran on for a share. FEROCITY was forwardly placed and sat just off the pacesetter around the turn, hustled along three wide into the stretch run and
weakened in the final furlong. UNCLE CHAD lacked speed and raced in the back, swung five wide into stretch and failed to rally.

SIR DEPUTY sped to the lead and crossed over to the inside soon after the start, held clear around the turn, saved ground turning for home and kept to task
in hand. TOUGH COMPANY stalked the leader into the turn, hustled up two wide near the quarter pole, was no match for clear winner but sustained a
steady bid and secured second best. A. K. SAFARI raced off the early pace, picked up the tempo four wide approaching the quarter pole, swung four wide
into the lane and prevailed for a share. BOTTOMLESS lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, was ridden along the rail into
upper stretch and had no kick. LIBERTARIAN tracked the pace in the opening quarter, hustled along in contention around the turn then gave way. PRICE
TO PAY raced up close through the backstretch, weakened mid-way around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
HAIL COLUMBIA hustled up out of the gate, cleared and crossed over to the inside soon after the start, set the uncontested pace and widened advantage
around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, came under a drive, responded willingly, drew off and finished ridden out late. SINGING EMMA was the
closest pursuer of the clear pacesetter in early stages, chased two to three wide around the turn, could not gain on the eventual winner but ran on with
response and secured second best. PINK PARTY PANTS was ridden along positioned off the clear top pair in early stages, sustained a three wide bid into
upper stretch and ran on for a share. SWEET HOLINESS raced off the early pace, cut the corner and gained position along the rail upper stretch then gave
way in the final furlong. BREW CASA raced off the early pace, came four wide into the lane and never threatened. STAY FABULOUS chased the clear top
pair into the turn then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
SWEET STROLL sped to a slim lead at the start and widened advantage past the midway point on the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, responded
gamely under a drive and finished going away. KYLIES HOPE chased the top pair into the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, hustled up along the inside
and cleared second best. HOODWICKED raced just off the leader in opening stages, chased two wide around the turn then weakened off the top pair and
just lasted for show. KAMEA raced midpack around the turn, hustled along two to three wide into upper stretch and just missed show. UNGLUED was off
awkward at the start and raced in the back, swung wide into the lane and passed tiring foes. DIXIE SHARPIE raced off the early pace, was ridden along four
wide into the lane and failed to menace. LARNED veered out at the start, raced off the pace and failed to move into contention. APACHE FLIGHT showed
response in the opening call then steadily retreated.
