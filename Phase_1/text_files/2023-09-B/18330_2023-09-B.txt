Footnotes
SKY BUY , a forward factor in the two path around the turn, determinedly chased the pace setter through the stretch and took the lead in deep stretch. P J'S
RIDER sprinted clear early, set the pace near the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. GINAMAYA saved ground around the turn and chased the pace
throughout in an even effort. HONOR THE TRUTH , caught in tight quarters after bumping with SUPER MONEY leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner
rail on the turn, altered course to the two path entering the stretch to avoid the heels of GOLDEN BLOSSOM, moved out in mid stretch and finished willingly.
CELTIC WAR CRY circled foes around the turn, was four deep at the head of the stretch, was brushed by SUPER MONEY near the three sixteenths pole
then bumped that one near the eighth pole before flattening out. SUPER MONEY bumped with HONOR THE TRUTH at the start, raced in the two path on
the turn, brushed CELTIC WAR CRY when drifting out in upper stretch then was bumped by that one near the eighth pole. HEY RIRI , wide on the turn, was
outrun. GOLDEN BLOSSOM , steadied in traffic mid way down the backstretch, raced along the inner rail on the turn and faltered. There was a stewards'
inquiry concerning the stretch run but no action was taken.

Footnotes
LOVING CUP saved ground while not too far back early on, steadied off heels into the turn, angled out soon after and responded when given her cue, rolled
up four to five wide to quickly gain into the lane, joined the embattled leaders from the outside with a furlong to go, poked a head in front heading to the
sixteenth marker, battled with DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD then edged clear late while kept alert. DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD prompted the pace three wide outside
THUNDER BOSS, moved to engage mid turn, dueled on a slim lead in upper stretch, fought on between rivals past mid stretch and continued with good
effort. THUNDER BOSS vied two wide on a short lead outside MEETMEATTHEBEACH, shook clear of that one into the turn, met an outside challenge mid
turn, stayed on to the inside of runners past mid stretch then faded late. MEETMEATTHEBEACH vied inside THUNDER BOSS early on, steadied when in a
bit tight into the turn, regrouped and tracked under rating while saving ground, edged up along the rail in upper stretch, failed to go on past mid stretch and
weakened. MATTY BO bobbled outward at the break, recovered and stalked two wide early on, steadied behind MEETMEATTHEBEACH into the turn,
shifted three wide to pursue but came up empty in the final furlong. DON DIVA dropped back early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CLASSIC JOKE quickly went clear then was joined outside by REGALO in the opening furlong, rated kindly two wide handling that outside pressure, edged
clear nearing the lane, responded when shaken up past the three sixteenths, kept on under right handed encouragement leaving mid stretch then held firm
while kept alert. REGALO drifted in slightly at the break and brushed with INVEIGLED, prompted the pace three wide outside the winner, couldn't quite
quicken with that one in upper stretch but stayed on well to be clear of the rest. INVEIGLED , brushed at the start, straightened, edged up early then
steadied back off foes near the five eighths, dropped inside after recovering, gained towards the rail under coaxing mid turn, came out approaching the
stretch and finished up well. SUMMERSTATEOFMIND saved ground stalking the pace, had aim under a ride in upper stretch, lacked a punch leaving mid
stretch and faded. GOODBYE NOTE broke slowly, regrouped and settled towards the rail, made a nice run while saving ground from the three eighths to
upper stretch, eased out with pursuit inside the furlong grounds but flattened out late. AMEN MCLAREN hopped slightly at the break, drifted in towards the
gap soon after, lagged back while saving ground, angled out for the drive but failed to menace. KINGDOM FORCE brushed with an inner rival at the break,
chased two wide, made a slight run past the three eighths, lacked a further response and dropped back in the drive. COUNT DADDY , brushed at the start,
raced off the pace and outside a rival leaving the far turn, failed to respond past the five sixteenths and retreated. HOLD MY STETSON , three to four wide
with early chase, wandered outward around the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
AMPERSAND bore out leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace three deep around the turn, offered a strong rally to sweep to command in upper stretch
then eagerly drew away while kept to his business. CARBONITE showed speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace to upper stretch, faded but was best
of the others. FROG TOWN raced in the two path on the turn, swung four wide at the head of the stretch and flattened out. ELUSIVE AGENT saved ground
on the turn, eased out entering the stretch and passed tired rivals. RUNNING RIVER disputed the pace outside CARBONIE and gave way. ABUELO PAPS
was outrun. SUPER ROCKER saved ground on the turn, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way.

SPICY MARGARITA sped clear early, set a rated pace towards the rail, opened up a bit after being set down two wide in upper stretch, kept on under
strong encouragement past the sixteenth pole and narrowly held off MUNDLE OF JOY. MUNDLE OF JOY broke inward and bumped with a rival,
straightened and tracked under rating towards the rail, was put to asking approaching the stretch, altered off the rail for room near mid stretch, closed
gamely but just could not quite get past. BREEZY CONNECTION , three deep leaving the far turn, circled four wide with momentum into the stretch, ranged
up near the sixteenth marker but was outfinished. GOLDEN CAN prompted the pace outside the winner, saw that one get away past the three sixteenths,
stayed on to give willing pursuit past mid stretch, shifted in through the final sixteenth and gave way grudgingly. NOBLE BID broke outward and bumped
with SPEAK YOUR MIND, corrected and chased towards the rail, lightly steadied into the turn then failed to make an impact from there. BLAME CATALAYA
, well back into the turn, came five wide for the drive and got past a tiring rival. SPEAK YOUR MIND , bumped and pinched back leaving the gate, edged up
between foes leaving the far turn, shifted out four wide for the drive, failed to go on leaving the three sixteenths and tired.

MURRAY , three deep stalking the pace around the turn, advanced outside BROTHER CONWAY, gained command near the sixteenth pole and held sway
under steady handling. BROTHER CONWAY bore out sharply leaving the starting gate, disputed the pace outside FIND FAITH around the turn, opened a
clear lead inside the three sixteenths pole and gave way grudgingly. LIBERTY STAR , along the inner rail around the turn, eased out in upper stretch and
offered a mild gain. AEQUOR was not an early factor, raced in the two path on the turn, swung outside in upper stretch and failed to rally. INSPIRED IRISH
raced along the inner rail around the turn and was never a factor. FIND FAITH hugged the inner rail, dueled to upper stretch and gave way. DELEGATED ,
steadied behind the winner after breaking slowly, trailed.

Footnotes
EVERETT'S SONG , taken to rate off the pace while saving ground, was pushed along and did not initially quicken nearing the far turn, angled out and
responded soon after, circled five wide advancing into the lane, drifted in despite left handed asks and engaged the embattled leaders nearing the furlong
grounds, took command soon after, straightened away and kicked clear while kept to task. OUTLIER , three wide early, edged up in hand and bid between
foes near the five furlong marker, gained a slim lead leaving the three eighths while also emerging in a duel to the inside of ALL THREES, clung to
command past the three sixteenths, dug in once headed by the winner then gave way grudgingly through the final yards. ALL THREES was rated back from
between rivals around the first turn then angled out, edged up and bid three deep leaving the five eighths, sparred outside OUTLIER from the three furlong
marker to upper stretch, fought between runners leaving mid stretch then faded late. IYWAAN settled two wide while not too far back, took closer order
when advancing between foes past the three eighths, was forced in a bit and steadied when attempting to work through a seam near the furlong grounds,
regrouped and churned on. MAGIC MICHAEL hopped at the break, lost ground three to four wide, edged up into the far turn, chased to upper stretch then
came up empty. UNCLE IRISH cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, was joined by a pair of rivals leaving the five eighths, battled on under
pressure leaving the far turn, failed to kick on near the five sixteenths and gave way. An objection by the rider of IYWAAN against the winner for alleged
interference near mid stretch was not allowed

Footnotes
BROOKLYN GIRL stalked the early duel, advanced three deep leaving the backstretch to secure command, opened a clear lead mid way on the far turn,
remained on her left lead through the stretch and prevailed under brisk urging. CYNERGY'S ELECTRA , well off the early duel, circled both turns three wide,
had a mild advance to upper stretch and failed to sustain her bid. OH MRS. MAISEL hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to the far turn then gave way.
CUMBERLAND FALLS disputed the pace, raced in the two path between horses down the backstretch and gave way. TANKA TOUGH , well off the duel,
faltered before going six furlongs and was eased.
