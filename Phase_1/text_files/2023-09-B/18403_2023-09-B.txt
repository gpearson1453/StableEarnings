Footnotes
DOGWOODSMILLIEJANE raced off the early duel, waited for racing room near the five sixteenths pole, raced three to two deep in the drive and prevailed
under strong handling. TAMARA'S WAY settled off the early pace, moved up from the inside around the far turn through the upper stretch, worked between
rivals and rallied gamely to the wire. SHES A SECRET tracked the early duel two deep, angled out through the upper stretch and kept on willingly to the
wire. SOCIAL MANDATE dueled for the early lead along the inside and weakened through the drive. COOL CAROL dueled from the outside of foe and tired
readily.

Footnotes
PUCKERED quick to begin to set an uncontested early pace, pressured a bit through the far turn and drew off to be well clear under a steady hand ride.
CHOCTAW GRACE was off a step slow, exchanged bumps near the seven eighths pole with Dooblay, tracked the early leader two deep from the outside,
ridden through the far turn and was no match for the winner while racing three to four wide. AUTISM COMPASSION was forced to check sharply from the
inside in the early stages, rated along under a firm hold, continued an inside through the far turn and raced even late with no closing run. ROSE DARLING
settled off the early pace, moved up from the inside around the far turn through the stretch and improved postion. WRECK IT RUBY stalked the pace from
the outside, raced three to four wide around the far turn and had no late rally. JAYCE AND LIAM was unhurried early on, raced two to four wide in the lane
and lacked a bid. ESPERE was off a step slow, raced off the early going, raced four deep into the upper stretch and never threatened. DOOBLAY was
bumped soundly near the seven eighths pole, dropped back off the early going and had no late response.

CALL ME GUSTO set his own uncontested early pace, shook well clear through the far turn, dug in from the inside of rival and prevailed under strong
handling in a determined run. SANT' ANTIMO stalked the top pair three deep, took aim near the eighth pole and kept on gamely to the wire while racing
from the outside. COASTAL DEFENSE rated early under a firm hold, raced two wide between near the three eighths pole, shifted our into the upper lane,
raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and kept on willingly to the wire. LONG CROW settled off the early pace near the inside, continued its inside
run past the three eighths pole, angled four deep near the three sixteenths pole and moved up to improve position. MASTER GAME dropped back off the
early pace, swung six wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. NAVY CROSS tracked the early leader from the outside and faded. TREATY raced
mid pack early on, saved ground and failed to sustain a bid.

COPPOLA dueled from the outside of Bodenheimer early on, dug in from the outside and just got up under all out pressure. BODENHEIMER dueled for the
early lead from the inside, dug in near the rail and just missed in a long drive. KAVOD chased the early pace setters two deep, raced from the inside into the
upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire while continuing an inside bid. VULCAN coaxed along early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no
final winning bid. SHIMMER ME TIMBERS was forced to check early from the inside, shifted out five wide in the drive and had no late response. JOHNNY
UNLEASHED took up at the break, raced at the back of the pack after the poor start, saved ground and never threatened.

finished gamely to secure second place finish. BROMLEY settled off the early pace, raced from the inside around the far turn, angled five wide and moved
up to improve position. LARK'S MISCHIEF dueled for the early lead from the outside of foes and weakened through the drive. BRITERDAYZAHEAD raced
