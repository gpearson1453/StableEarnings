Footnotes
FINALIST cleared to the rail taking this field into the first turn, was unchallenged setting a soft pace down the backside, continued to be left alone dictating
the pace on the final turn, opened up when roused turning for home and was kept to the task to comfortably cruise home for the win. BET tracked four wide
entering the first turn, closed the gap mildly outside down the back straightaway, was asked for more three wide outside horses three furlongs to go, angled
out in the four path to be in the mix of things at the top of the lane and finished up late, winning the duel for second but could not threaten the winner. STOP
THE HUMBUG travelled in the middle of the pack inside early on, took closer order to the frontrunner down the backstretch on the rail, was nestled on the
fence behind the winner waiting to pounce on the far turn, shifted outside in the two path for the drive, could not reel in the winner who had more left and
was outfinished battling for place in deep stretch. MAMBOINTHEFOREST watched the leader into the first turn, continued to be content sitting behind the
pacesetter down the backstretch, was nudged to go after the leader three furlongs from the finish, could not gain through the turn chasing the front-running
winner and levelled off between rivals in the three path in mid stretch. FULL EXTREME settled near the rear three wide on the first turn, co-trailed on the
outside down the backside, was urged three furlongs from home, offered little response and could not get involved in the drive to the wire. HADDASSAH'S
DEVIL hopped slightly to be a step slow on the break, could see the field into the first turn on the rail, co-trailed on the inside down the back straight, was
roused for more on the fence three eighths from the wire, made little headway and had no finish to give through the stretch drive.

RELOAD'S REBEL led the way on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and dug in in the lane, dueling on the inside before giving
way near the wire. CRUMLIN LAD tracked the leader on the inside through the early going, saved ground around the turn and kept on in the stretch. MT
LOGAN raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and finished evenly. LONG POND
raced off the pace early, swung out to the four path to began a bid nearing the quarter pole and flattened out in the lane. BE LIKE CLINT raced in the middle
of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the two path and faded from there. POINT TO THE STARS trailed the field up the

Footnotes
GOODLUCKMATE was allowed to gather himself trailing in the beginning, could still see the field down the backside, took closer order to the pack gaining
momentum with three furlongs to run, began to lengthen his stride in the four path at the top of the lane having clear run, burst between horses at the furlong
marker and was going away when crossing the finish line. PAT'S GAMBLE tracked on the rail in the second flight into the first turn, kept a close eye on the
front duo with rivals on either side at the half mile marker, was on hold waiting for running room behind the leaders throughout the far turn, bid for the lead in
the three path straightening out for the drive, poked his nose in front briefly with an eighth to run but was not match for the closing winner in deep stretch.
TAX INCLUDED had a slim advantage in the first turn, hounded outside while setting the pace down the backstretch, was headed three furlongs from home,
relinquished the lead inside at the quarter pole, never gave in on the rail through the stretch and resurged to capture third in a determined front running
effort. PROUD RONIN stalked three wide in the first of two turns, improved down the backstretch to track three deep at the half, rallied around foes three
wide three eighths from the line, was floated out to the seven path turning for home bidding for the lead and evened out in the final furlong for a minor role.
JULIE'S MIST had a good position outside tracking on the first turn, prompted the pace outside under a hard hold down the back straight, was roused
between runners midway on the far turn to inch away for the lead, drifted out under a drive in the six path at the top of the stretch and faded in the final
furlong. HYGGE stalked close to the back of the pack in the early stages, was hard ridden three furlongs out making little impression on the final turn and
could not reach contention running to the finish line. SPANISH SERENADE pressed on the rail into the first turn, was shuffled back inside to track the
engaging leaders at the half, roused three furlongs for more, offered little run saving ground through the far turn and could not offer a finish on the fence
down the stretch.

Footnotes
NEWPORT AGENT saved ground around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid coming around the far
bend, entered the stretch from the five path and gained ground rapidly on the outside to get up for the win late. CHELSEA DAGGER saved ground at the
back of the pack through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn on the rail, began a bid entering the stretch, gained ground and took over the
lead near the wire and was caught in the final strides. JUST START ME UP saved ground early, stalked the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch,
navigated the second turn from the three path and gained ground late to narrowly miss. DERZKII raced in the two path around the first bend, pressed the
pace on the inside up the backstretch, challenged while saving ground around the far turn and dueled in the lane, weakening in the final strides. THY
KINGDOM hit the gate leaving it, raced in the three path around the first bend, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside,
navigated the far turn still in the three path and finished evenly. SILENT LUCIDITY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half
mile, continued around the far turn in the two path and finished evenly. CARMENOOTZ hopped up leaving the gate, led the way from the three path around
the first turn and up the backstretch, battled from the two path around the far turn and faded in the final furlong. KITTEN'S BOY raced in the three path
around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the far bend in the two path and passed tiring horses in the lane. SENSIBLE
PORTIONS raced in the four path around the first turn, chased the leaders up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and faded in the
stretch. COPINSAY tracked the frontrunners on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, swung out to the four path for the run around the
second bend and tired from there. BAYTOWN ELVIS saved ground early, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back coming
around the far turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
HATMAKER HOLIDAY took control clearing from the outside at the start, was relaxed comfortably setting the pace uncontested throughout the turn and was
well rated to have something left in reserve to keep fellow rivals at bay to the wire. PINO IN A PURSE tracked three wide on the outside in the beginning,
was content to sit back just off the frontrunning winner down the backside, urged right handed at the quarter pole but could not reel in the winner and chased
stubbornly in vain to the finish, easily besting the rest in the end. CEFALO stalked near the rear rating kindly in hand at the half mile marker, was scrubbed
inside making little gain throughout the turn, found another gear at the top of the lane, had her best stride late in the final sixteenth and closed in to capture
third money. LOADED QUESTION settled in midfield on the outside down the backstretch, was let out a notch outside horses three furlongs from the finish,
put in a mild run gaining on rivals to be in the mix for a small share three wide turning for home and stalled in the final sixteenth to be on the fringes at the
finish. ISHIYAYA tracked the winner on the rail early on, was steadied inside at the five furlong marker, travelled on the fence keeping tabs of the top two on
the turn, was nudged for more run five sixteenths out but was losing ground to the leaders and finished up one paced down the stretch. ENDORPHIN RUSH
was unhurried trailing down the back straight, caught up to the field three wide outside at the half, could not make any progress outside horses running
through the turn and was no menace on the fence down the stretch.

Footnotes
TOP OF THE CHARTS broke sharp at the start, was allowed to settle dropping back on the rail rating kindly in the third flight with five eighths remaining,
rallied up the fence three furlongs from the wire, loomed the threat on the inside at the top of the stretch, surged clear on the rail at the furlong marker and
cruised home for a convincing win. GUNS N' ROJAS trailed the field down the backstretch, began to extend his stride running outside beside the eventual
winner at the seven sixteenths marker, was throttled down behind rivals three furlongs out, swung outside widest in the six path driving to the finish and
closed belatedly to capture second money at the wire in a photo. SOONER LUNAR tracked in the three path down the backside outside of runners,
prompted the pace outside throughout the turn, bid in the three path with horses on either side at the top of the lane, could not accelerate with the winner in
mid- stretch and was caught late for the place share trying to chase the winner to the finish. GATLING GUN stumbled at the break, recovered to track the
pacesetter under a snug hold inside down the backstretch, settled nicely watching the front pair through the turn, angled out to the four path to be in range
at the top of the lane but needed more between foes in deep stretch to be a factor at the wire. REPEAT THE HEAT stalked in the third flight between rivals
five furlongs out, was roused for more run trying to keep pace with others, shifted outside from behind horses in the five path with three sixteenths from the
line and evened out in the last eighth. CITRUS BOY set the pace up front down the backside, continued to have a slim advantage running on the turn, was
collared by horses on each side straightening out for home, could not find more and yielded in the last furlong. TRINITY PARK travelled outside foes near
the back of the pack down the back straight, was uninterested trailing while saving ground running on the turn and could not get into the race on the fence
down the lane passing a straggler in the final sixteenth. PRINCE OF THIEVES stalked three deep in the third flight at the five eighths marker, offered a mild
run outside horses four wide three furlongs to go, shifted out to the five path for the drive to the wire and gave way in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
BARTICA stalked in midfield three wide in the first turn, continued three wide down the backstretch basically unchanged in position, was roused going for a
seam in the two path midway on the far turn, swung outside with run four wide for the stretch drive outside foes and got up just before the wire for a well
timed surge to win. HEEZESPEEDY pressed the issue early on outside into the first turn, reined back to track the loose frontrunner down the backside,
assumed command outside three furlongs from the finish, opened up on runners at the top of the lane and just missed for the win being caught by the
closing winner nearing the wire. WICKEDBLACKBULLET was void of early speed trailing inside in the early stages, took closer order to the pack when the
field bunched up three furlongs from the wire, improved on the rail early part of the final turn, had to wait inside behind a weakening runner at the quarter
pole, shifted outside off the fading foe turning for home and rallied on the fence at the furlong marker to get up for third nearing the finish. RIVER OF
BABYLON had a good position watching the top two running between foes down the backside, comfortably closed the gap on the leaders three furlongs
from the wire, nudged for more run to maintain position on the far turn, was in the hunt in the three path at the top of the lane, battled gamely in the stretch
but stalled some late just missing out holding for third money in the end. SEATTLE DOWN UNDER travelled near the rear when bumped by an inside foe
entering the first turn, settled close to the back of the pack outside horses down the backside, began to gather momentum picking up runners three wide
three furlongs out, was full of run in the two path turning for home but could not find a clear lane to run through the entire stretch. RURAL had a slim lead on
the rail entering the first turn, opened up down the backstretch, was headed outside with three furlongs to go, offered little resistance, tired between horses
in the final furlong when knocked off stride in deep stretch by an outside rival looking for room and lost a position narrowly at the finish. JUST THE MAX
settled five wide in midfield entering the first turn, was shuffled back through the field running outside down the backstretch, failed to quicken with others
running three wide on the far turn and could no be a factor driving to the finish line. ARNIE P travelled on the rail in mid-pack on the first turn, was allowed to
settle near the rear unhurried inside down the back straight, was steadied on the fence losing rail position entering the far turn, could not recover to pose a
threat and passed tired runners in the lane. STREET SERENADE stalked near the rear bumping an outside rival into the first turn, made an early move
three deep advancing outside of horses down the backside to track the front pair three wide with three furlongs to go, could not sustain the run and gave
way in the six path in upper stretch. HOLIDAY IN CHILE settled nicely on the rail watching the front duo on the first turn, had good position inside tracking
the front pair down the back straight, came under a ride on the rail five sixteenths from home, made little progress and retreated on the fence turning for
home. TRAINERS CLAIM OF FOUL #2 RURAL AGAINST #9 SEATTLE DOWN UNDER NEARING THE FINISH RESULTED IN #9 SEATTLE DOWN
UNDER BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACE SIXTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH
