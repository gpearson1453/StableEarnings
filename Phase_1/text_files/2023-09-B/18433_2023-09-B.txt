stretch then just had a little bit more to be up at the wire in the end. DREAM SEQ dueled with UPTOWN WALK THE LINE down the backstretch and into the
turn, was in a long drive in the home stretch then hung in the end. PEARLS COMET AA tracked the pace while two wide and between rivals then advanced
to third position on the turn and held the show prize in the end. AA BURNING TEMERITY chased the pace while three wide down the backstretch then
flattened out after the turn. RB MAMA WINGATE chased the pace while four wide then bid heading into the far turn before flattening out in the remainder of
the course. ERIN MHF settled along the inside and was no threat. COLOR ME GONE MHF tracked the pace from the inside in the early back stretch then
