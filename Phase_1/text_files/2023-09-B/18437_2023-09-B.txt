KAKE'S TAP DANCER rated along under a firm hold early, raced three wide into the upper stretch, came in, bumped Invest wisely nearing the eighth pole,
forced Invest Wisley to check deep stretch and was disqualified and placed fourth after a jockey objection. RED HOT AND BLUE dropped back off the early
going, raced two to four wide around the far turn, surged from the far outside missed in a belated run. MAGIC IN THE PARK rated along early, raced two
wide between near the five sixteenths pole, shifted five wide and finished gamely to the wire. INVEST WISELY quick to begin to set the early pace, raced
from the inside into the upper stretch, was bumped soundly, forced to take up through the stretch run and kept on the wire. COMPASS RISES was allowed
to settle early, raced near the inside throughout and had not enough in the drive. MEOW MEOW HISS was unhurried early on, raced two to three wide and
had no final winning bid. I'M GLAD (IRE) tracked the top pair from the inside and faded. KRONE raced four wide around the far turn and lacked a bid.

SPITBALL tracked the early pace, raced two deep near the quarter pole, dug in and prevailed under all out pressure. CAPTAIN CARDO dropped back off
the early going, swung wide into the upper stretch, surged late and missed in game effort. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO settled off the early going, raced
near the rail in the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. BAD GUY raced near the back of the pack early, was along the inside through the far turn,
angled out and moved up to improve position. E J'S REVENGE raced mid pack, was four deep through the far turn, raced from the outside in the lane and
had no late rally. TENAX pressed the early pace two wide between and weakened in the drive. HIS ROYAL G set a pressured pace from the inside and
faded. ONE MORE FACTOR pressed the pace from the outside of foes and tired. OUR HOISTED MAST was fanned wide into the upper stretch and never
threatened.

ARTEMUS BRIDGE raced near the back of the pack early, advanced three to five wide around the far turn, surged up from the far outside in the stretch and
just got up under strong pressure. BOMBOLONI stalked the early pace, made a quick early bid to take command, raced well clear near the eighth pole and
was wore down late in a game effort. SIR TERRE settled off the early pace, was blocked nearing the eighth pole, angled out to race from the far outside and
closed in belatedly. JAMMIN STILL rated to race mid pack under a hold, raced five wide between in the drive and was outkicked late. JACKIE A raced with
the second flight in the early stages, moved up four to five wide around the far turn and had not enough late while racing from the outside. GALLANT GOLD
stalked the top pair, raced near the inside past the quarter pole and weakened through the drive. BOURBON CURRENCY dropped back early to race mid
pack, saved ground and had no late rally. MINT GAME raced off the early pace, experienced traffic near the eighth while racing five deep and lacked a late
rally. AESTHETICALLY failed to sustain a bid. BLAMEITONTHEFUN set a pressured early pace from the inside and tired readily.

Footnotes
REAP WHAT YOU SOW tracked the early leader from the outside and kicked on gamely to edge clear under strong encouragement. FUN COAST showed
good early foot from the inside and gave way to the winner late grudgingly. MASTER OOGWAY stalked the pace from the inside, checked near the three
eighths pole, waited for racing room near the quarter pole and kept finished willingly while continuing an inside run. THUNDERHOUSE settled off the early
pace, raced two to three wide in the lane and finished willingly to the wire. ISRAELI ARMY dropped back to race mid pace, moved up five to six wide into the
upper stretch and flattened out. FROG PRINCE was shuffled back at the start, raced off the early going after the poor start, raced from the outside around
the far turn through the stretch and had no late rally. MENO took up at the break, raced five to six wide around the far turn and never threatened while racing
from the far outside. GOODTIMETOBEIRISH broke awkwardly, raced near the inside throughout and never menaced. DOLLARS N SENSE prompt the
early leader from the outside and faded.
