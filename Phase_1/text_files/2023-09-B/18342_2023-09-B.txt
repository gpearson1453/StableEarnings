the quarter pole, took the lead approaching the eighth pole but was unable to resist the winner late. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO vied with AWESOME PIC for
the lead from along the outside, dropped back slightly nearing the quarter pole, came four-wide into the stretch and finished well for third in a steady effort.
AWESOME PIC vied for the lead from along the inside, drifted out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. SHE'S PEACHY KEEN was

CASINO TRICKS was reserved off the early pace, rallied five-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished fast to be up in the final sixteenth. BARFLY was
allowed to settle early, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole and closed strongly. DISCREET DEVIL prompted the issue while racing three-wide and
finished well for third in a steady effort. VENTILATOR was very fractious pre race, then saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and weakened late.
ELUSIVE IMAGE saved ground chasing the pace but lacked the needed late response. FOE saved ground while being unhurried and was gaining late while
angling out during the drive. TAKEOVER KASH was forwardly placed to the stretch while racing two-wide and tired.

KITTEN'S CLOWN settled in the middle of the field, moved up along the outside of the turn, came six-wide into the stretch and finished fast to be up in the
final strides. CORONOVA broke out to bump STELLWAGEN BANKER, then set the pressured pace, drifted out slightly entering the stretch, responded
when asked but was unable to resist the winner late in a game effort. ANDREZ CONQUIST saved ground chasing CORONOVA, slipped through during the
drive and finished in a mild rally. STELLWAGEN BANKER was bumped from both sides at the start then pinched back, was unhurried early, came
seven-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. TUCKER ROAD was forwardly placed while racing three-wide but lacked a rally when asked. MAKOTO
saved ground racing in the middle of the field and went evenly. OUT OF TOWNER was allowed to settle early, came three-wide into the stretch but failed to
seriously threaten. CARICO broke in to bump STELLWAGEN BANKER then prompted the early pace while racing two-wide and tired. BOINTHEBACK was
shuffled back at the start, dropped well back behind the field and failed to menace. SILVER R saved ground and gave way.

CROSS BORDER hopped slightly at the start then saved ground while being unhurried, angled out five-wide entering the stretch and finished fast to take
the lead at the sixteenth pole and quickly draw clear. TAWNY PORT saved ground setting the pace while racing in hand, responded when asked but was
unable to resist the winner late. TOUGH TICKETS was forwardly placed from the outside while racing three-wide and finished well for third in a steady effort.
COMMANDEER was allowed to settle in stride, moved up four-wide nearing the three-eighths pole but lacked the needed late response. BEACON HILL
saved ground while racing in the middle of the field, angled out to split rivals nearing the three-eighths pole, came three-wide into the stretch and went
evenly. URBAN MYTH prompted the pace while racing two-wide and weakened nearing the stretch. PRALINE'S CAT saved ground while being unhurried
and was not a factor. TEE AT ONE was close up racing along the inside for six furlongs and gave way. FINAL TIME CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW,
FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
AHSAD saved ground chasing Mundo Mix, slipped through entering the stretch, took the lead from that one at the eighth pole and gradually edged clear.
MUNDO MIX was four-wide on the first turn setting the pace, angled to the inside entering the backstretch, drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
responded when headed and held on gamely for the place. BERMONDSEY was unhurried early, moved up five-wide nearing the quarter pole and was
making up ground late. DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY dropped back early, moved up three-wide nearing the three-eighths pole to reach contention then flattened
out during the drive. NIGHT OPS was allowed to settle early while racing three-wide but lacked a rally. SCREEN SAVER saved ground while being reserved
off the early pace but had no response when called upon. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY was off a step slow then was five-wide on the first turn, angled in to be
three-wide from that point and failed to menace.
