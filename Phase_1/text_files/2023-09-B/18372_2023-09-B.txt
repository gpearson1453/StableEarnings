Footnotes
SPIRIT OF WINDSOR pressed a narrow lead to upper stretch dueling abreast there clearing late. FIFTY PESOS pressed the pace dueling inside of rival
through the turn then down the lane ceding grudgingly late. OLD FORTY FIVE a step slow through the turn gave a mild rally down the lane moving past the
others. SALTY SNAPPER off slowly lagged to upper stretch picking up tired ones there. EL DUQUE slow early race five wide down the lane passing a few
there. MYSTIC MINISTER pressed then chased on the turn tiring in upper stretch. BRAVE HILARIO weakened on the turn. CHEEKY CHAPS raced evenly
through the turn fading down the lane. ROARING OCEAN was never involved.
