KETTLE KISS good break, eased over to the rail with a perfect trip and cleared while well handled. BOSSY LADY good position to far turn angled out for
clear run with a game second. LOFTY COWTOWN chased leader to stretch, stayed to final stages and just missed place. GOODNESS SAKES settled back
to far turn, rallied along to improve in the stretch. AUNT BEE unhurried early, raced rank at the half, split horses turn mildly. DEW IT WITH STYLE sprinted
to front, led to deep stretch in game fashion faltered. EARLY BLOOMER outside run throughout and never a factor. LUCKY PENNY ROSE never menaced
throughout. SARAH JANE close up to the half with nothing left and dropped back readily. LATE DATE always outrun with no visible excuse. Race was hand
timed due to a bad sensor on the turf course, all turf races will be hand timed for the remainder of the meet. Acm

Footnotes
Q BOND good position to far turn, kicked in strongly with a rush from the far turn to be along in time with a solid effort under stout handling to the wire.
QUEEN OF ATLANTIS quick outside to the front, held to the final lunge on the wire in a game effort. BRIC A BRAC troubled in the first turn with an off rail
run to far turn, late bid in the stretch but too late. NO WAY IT'S TODAY (GB) rushed outside first turn, dueled leader, chased to far turn missed with a good
effort. DOWHATEVERITTAKES close up throughout but leveled off in the stretch run. ORCHARD ROAD no speed throughout and never close. RUE
troubled into first turn and was through early, dropped back. SPUN OATS never factored throughout. TEXAS PRINCESS raced rank while in tight quarter
around the first turn, tried to keep for a half with nothing left and faded back readily. RITZY CAT ducked in sharply from the gate and was always outrun.
Race was hand timed due to a bad sensor on the turf course, all turf races will be hand timed for the remainder of the meet. Acm
