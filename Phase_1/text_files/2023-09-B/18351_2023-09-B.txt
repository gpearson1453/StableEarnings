TOXIC RELATIONSHIP broke in/bumped start, dueled, best late. LIL LONGMIRE shifted out/bothered foes 1/8, lugged out late, outnodded. JESS DREAM
OF ME up close, game try. FAMOUS SHINING STAR away well, outkicked. CIR LADY MOON forced out 1/8, lost path midway, gamely. SHE GOES UP
lunged/hit gate start. A DREAM TO FILL away well, weakened. LETTY CARTEL crowded/took up 1/8. SWEET TESS bothered/took up 1/8. STEWARDS
INQUIRY, After reviewing video of the race from all angles, the Stewards unanimously voted to disqualify Lil Longmire from second to ninth position. The
review showed the horse bearing out considerably, forcing CIR Lady Moon into the path of both horses and forcing their riders to check their mounts
sharply. The incident, in the Stewards opinion, cost both horses the opportunity for a better placing.
