Footnotes
PRINCESS PEANUT broke on top, set the pace from outside, went three wide on the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held sway while being kept to
task. MOLLY MALONE was just off the leader racing between runners early, dropped back past the seven-sixteenths, switched outside the leader coming to
the quarter pole four wide and under some urging, was no match but second best. DARK DUTCHESS was coaxed forward in the early going, pressed from
inside, lacked the needed late kick. INTOLERANT raced off the inside part of the course, failed to rally.

Footnotes
TOUCH CODE was a bit hard to load, pressed from between runners, drew even with the leader about the five-sixteenths, was headed by an outside rival
nearing the furlong grounds, fought on determinedly inside that foe to get the nod. KERANOS tracked in behind the leading trio saving ground early, moved
out four wide coming to the quarter pole advancing on the leaders, took a narrow lead at the eighth pole, dueled to the wire and was outfinished in losing the
nod. FIRST TO LAST moved forward under coaxing from the break to set the pace racing off the fence into the first turn, was pressured up the backstretch
by outside rivals, fought on to the eighth pole then yielded grudgingly. APPENDAGE lacked early speed, dropped back further heading to the far turn, came
out in upper stretch, passed tired rivals. DEFINE settled outside at the back, failed to rally. MARCUS JUNIUS was urged forward from the break racing
outside three to four wide, prompted the pace early up the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn and faded.

SHELLBACK set the pace racing off the rail, was headed by an inside foe turning into upper stretch, dug in dueling outside that one to prevail. BLIND EYE
broke through the gate, settled into stride shifting in on the first turn to track the leaders saving ground, bid inside coming the five-sixteenths and under
urging, took a narrow advantage soon after, was outdueled to the wire. BALI ROLLING TIDE stumbled at the start, was outpaced early, swung out six wide
in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. RAY'S GONE ASTRAY prompted the early pace from outside then settled in to stalk, went three wide on the far turn
dropping back and shifting in a bit, lacked the needed late kick. MORALES LITTLE KID stalked from outside racing mostly four wide, needed more.

INSTIGATED pressed the pace from outside while kept quite wide in the three to four path, prompted the pace from the half taking a narrow advantage,
dueled to the wire and held the inside rival. CONSPIRACY FACT shifted to the rail heading to the first turn and soon took over the lead, set the pace inside,
was pressured and headed from the half, fought on gamely to the wire but was second best. DEEP FAITH was bumped lightly at the start and a half-step
slow, caught five wide through both turns, kept on but was too late. SEICHE was bumped into a rival lightly at the start, raced off the pace two to three wide,
went evenly. SPECTRIER broke outwardly bumping a rival, was caught four to five wide on the first turn, stalked just off the leaders up the backstretch,
continued in range four deep on the far turn, weakened in the stretch. TINY TIN settled off the pace inside just off the rail, came out in upper stretch, ran on.
I AM THAT I AM switched out off the inside racing at the back, swung seven wide into upper stretch, needed more. OLIVER was forwardly-positioned and
keen to go on three to four wide and between runners early, came up empty.

Footnotes
BUSTINUPISHARDTODO soon led, set the pace off the rail, shook clear of pursuers past the seven-sixteenths, widened heading into upper stretch and
held safe. NOTION TO TAPIT was coaxed forward inside, tracked the eventual winner saving ground, came out a bit at the top of the stretch and chased
the winner home. HOP AND SCOTCH bumped with a rival after the start, advanced under some urging three wide and between foes on the turn, came out
six wide at the top of the stretch, kept on late but needed more. CALL ME MAESTRO had some light bumps soon after the start, shifted in at that juncture,
saved ground near the rail through the turn, ran on evenly. SIR SMOAK chased from outside four to five wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick.
TROPHY ROOM was mid-pack five to six wide through the turn, failed to rally. AWKWARD PAUSE was lightly bumped after the start, raced at the back off
the inside in about the three path into the turn, swung eight wide into upper stretch, failed to menace. FATHER GLADO chased from between runners early,
dropped back on the turn about two to three wide, swung seven wide leaving that bend, made no late bid. MY EAGLE SOARS pressed briefly three to four
deep after the opening three-sixteenths, began to weaken despite urging past the seven-sixteenths, faded.

Footnotes
DIA DE SOL was forwardly-positioned pressing from outside three to four wide, took over at the seven-sixteenths, was clear while drifting out leaving the far
turn, continued to drift out in upper stretch then straightened out and kicked away from the nearest pursuer. WATERWORKS switched out entering the first
turn stalking in the four path, advanced four wide on the far turn and asked for more past the five-sixteenths, raced just off the eventual winner and shifted
inside that one at the top of the stretch, proved no match but second best. MY BOSS LADY broke a step slowly, shifted in to the two path early, raced near
the inside coming out to advance past a tiring rival on the far turn, was best of the rest. INSIDE THE BOX was caught wide entering the first turn, eased
back off a rival and shifted in three wide racing toward the back, failed to rally. ELEGANT TASTE got away well going straight to the front, set a pressured
pace inside and off the rail, gave way. UNA LUNA bobbled at the start, failed to threaten racing mostly four to five wide and at the back.

Footnotes
GEE WIZ moved forward inside to press the pace inside nearly even with the outside runner before settling back off that one, re-engaged making a bid
inside coming to the quarter pole, cut the corner well into upper stretch and drew away under steady handling. D'LIGHTFUL SUMMER settled outside off
the pace going four to five wide on the turn, asked for more at the quarter pole, came out a bit turning into upper stretch, kept on to get up for second.
LIVING IN STYLE was urged at the start, chased in behind the pace, moved three to four wide coming to the quarter pole looming a threat, could not sustain
the effort and lost place late. CATALINA CRUZIN raced at the back off the rail in the two path into the turn, came out at the top of the stretch, was never
near enough to threaten. INSOUCIANT forced the pace racing two to three wide into and on the turn, challenged by rivals inside and out coming to the
quarter pole, gave way.

Footnotes
DEL REY DOLLY moved forward inside late up the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, bid inside in mid-stretch taking a narrow lead, dueled late and
prevailed. BETWEEN DREAMS moved forward inside to take the lead after the opening furlong, set a pressured pace racing well off the rail off the rail, went
in the three path through the turn, drifted out a bit turning for home, was challenged by an inside foe, moved back in a bit to hook up with that rival but was
second best. MOON ME AGAIN raced in behind mid-pack three to four wide on the turn, improved position in upper stretch, needed more late. PLAYERA
settled off the pace near the inside, advanced inside rivals into upper stretch, came out and ran on. DAILY BRIEFING settled off the pace racing off the
inside, angled ten wide past the quarter, evened out in the drive. PROSPERA moved out in the early going, chased between runners in the second flight five
wide through the turn, failed to menace. NURSE RACHETT raced outside six wide through the turn, failed to rally. CUP OF LIFE pressed from between
runners into the turn, went four wide on that bend, faded. SALSA RITA attended the pace from outside racing five wide on the turn, faded.
