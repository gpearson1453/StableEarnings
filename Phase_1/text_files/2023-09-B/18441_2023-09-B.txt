Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUSHOLIDAY ran in the four path off pace then went four wide around the turn and then rallied late stretch for the win. PRECEDENT maintained
a steady pace, snuck into to the rail next to THOUGHTS OF GOLD coming around the turn then got caught late into the stretch. OHHH DADDY ran in the
two path then coming around the turn saw a gap on the inside made a move to rally in the two path. COUYONS CAUSE ran in the three path dueled
THOUGHTS OF GOLD for about a quarter mile then took to the outside on the stretch after coming around the turn three wide. THOUGHTS OF GOLD had
good early speed went back and forth from the rail to the two path, went around the turn two wide then faded coming on to the stretch. TIZ'A STELLAR
DUDE trailed the pack on the rail, didn't kick. I'M NOBLE coming out of the gate stumbled, looked like the nose got drug in the dirt then never regained after
that. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
