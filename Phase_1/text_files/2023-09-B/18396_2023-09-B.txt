Footnotes
CHASING AFTER YOU mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals, split foes, made a steady gain and edged ahead
in the final strides. VALIANT VICTORIA sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, drew off in the stretch and was outfinished.
LIGHTNING FIRE hard to rated inside, raced boxed through the turn, found room and angled out, bidding outside the leader into the stretch, then flattened
and held the show. SHANNON well placed and outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and had no rally.
DEVRA WARRIOR allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and passed a
tiring rival. FOR CRYIN OUT LOUD was a brief factor.

turn, came through inside into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. LORD OF LEGENDS tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide
into the stretch and faded. MARGARITA SUNRISE well placed and outside, moved up on the two path through the turn, then faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
MR. REDOLFO well placed and inside, gained position through the turn, found room and angled three wide, bidding outside the leader, gained a short,
drifting in slightly brushing CHANGE THE HOUR and prevailed over that one. CHANGE THE HOUR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on
when challenged into the stretch, then came again brushing late and missed. ON AN ISLAND allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn on the two
path, came through on that path into the stretch and closed for the show. RECKLESS JONES mid pack and inside, gained position through the turn, came
through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. JUANSEN well placed and outside, held position three and four wide through the turn,
fanned five wide into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. MAC'S CAT broke a step slowly from the gate, looped up three and four wide through the
turn, was carried out widest into the stretch and improved position. GRUIT unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned five wide into
the stretch and passed tiring rivals. HUMBLE JOE mid pack, lost some ground four and five wide through the turn, angled further out into the stretch and
could not gain. WARRIOR'S WAY OUT unsettled in the gate, was well placed inside, angled out through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had
no rally. OVERTIME CHARLIE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and faded the final furlong. DONAHUE
rated back early, tracked the leader through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch and faded. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION LODGED
BY THE RIDER OF CHANGE THE HOUR AGAINST THE RIDER OF MR. REDOLFO FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH, RESULTED IN NO
CHANGE
