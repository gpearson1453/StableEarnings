Footnotes
PARDY PLEASER settled off the pace while racing two wide, tipped three wide in upper stretch, kicked in, was up near the sixteenth pole and quickly
cleared. PLEASANT EMBRACE broke in a tangle, made good progress down the backstretch, tracked the pace four wide and ran on through the lane to
gain the place. KAITIE KAIT pressed the pace in the three path, bid in upper stretch, bumped with CROWN JAK nearing the eighth pole and weakened in
the final furlong. CROWN JAK set the pace in the two path, bumped nearing the eighth pole and was outfinished. RED HOT SPARK hit the starting gate,
trailed inside early, went four wide around the turn and lacked the needed rally while lugging in through the stretch. CORINTH broke in a tangle and had the
rider lose the left iron at the start, regained the iron entering the turn, raced five wide around the bend and never threatened. CAJUN ANTHEM saved
ground in range, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired.

Footnotes
DIVO D'ORO laid up close inside the pacesetter in the two path, waited confidently along the rail rounding the turn, was coaxed while shifting out to the six
path at the top of the lane, rallied to take the lead just after the eighth pole, and was wrapped up late. SUPERFIGHT set the pace in the three path, was
roused in the two path rounding the turn, floated out to the four path in upper stretch, lost the lead just after the eighth pole, but stayed on to secure place.
COME DREAM WITH ME stalked in the four path, was roused to bid in the three path around the turn, tipped out to the five path into the stretch, but
flattened while drifting out passing the eighth pole. A FANCY SOLUTION chased in the four path, but was tired while floating out to the eight path turning
into the stretch. FUNTASTIC THREE broke out at the start, raced off the pace in the six path, tipped into the three path early into the turn, but failed to
menace.

MY LADY JAMES pressed the pace in the four path, took over nearing the quarter pole, drew clear soon after and widened handily. FACE THE MUSIC set
a pressured pace in the two path, as no match for the winner in the lane but dug in to hold the place. ONE OF ONE bumped with CHAINA after the start,
trailed in the two path, swung five wide turning for home and rallied widest for the show. OMO TEN GIRL vied between foes in the three path, could not
keep pace with the winner in upper stretch, battled between foes for the minor awards and was outfinished. PRINCESS BLAKELY failed to menace while
racing three and four wide. CHLOE'S TOY popped the gate prior to the start and was outrun inside. CHAINA was bumped after the start, saved ground and
made little impact.

final furlong, took the lead while bumping twice with a drifting inner foe nearing the sixteenth, and held on. TAPINTOYOURBEER stalked in the four path,
was roused to range up approaching the three eighths, took the lead under a drive nearing the quarter pole, tipped out to the five path into the stretch, dug
in, but drifted out after left handed cues and bumped an outer foe twice around the final sixteenth, and was outlasted to place. CAPTURETHELAUGHTER
prompted the pace in the three path, was under right handed encouragement between rivals midway around the turn, and flattened in the three path passing
the eighth pole for show. IL MALANDRINO set the pace inside, was coaxed from the rail going into the turn, lost the lead approaching the quarter, and faded
in the stretch. DUKE SKYWALKER had his head turned at the start, chased inside, shifted out under a drive around the turn, but was empty entering the

Footnotes
KAEKO bobbled slightly leaving the gate, stalked in the five path, ranged up under rousing midway around the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top
of the stretch, stayed on, and inched past an inner duo late to win. AWESOME ANNMARIE set the pace from the two path into the turn, lost the lead under
coaxing passing the three eighths, fought on inside of rivals from the two path turning into the lane, and kept on under right handed encouragement for
place. SIMPLIFY (ARG) had a rank start, pressed in the three path, bid going into the turn, led passing the three eighths point, was under right handed
encouragement in the four path entering the stretch, but evened out between foes passing the sixteenth to show. SOPHIA'S STORM prompted the pace in
the four path, was ridden between foes midway around the turn, swung from the five path into the lane, but faded. BLACK ICE had her head turned at the
start and broke in a tangle, rated in the three path, was driven from the rail early around the turn, but made no impact from the three path in the stretch.
SHEZA HAPPY GIRL trailed in the six path, tipped into the three path early into the turn, but failed to menace from the six path in the stretch.

Footnotes
BABY STEPS set the pace in the two path, was confidently handled rounding the turn, kicked away while floating out to the four path into the stretch, drifted
out in the final sixteenth, but held safe. CHOOSE JOY had her head turned, hit the inner side of the gate, then an inner foe at the start, trailed in the four
path, was coaxed early into the turn, fanned out to the seven path into the lane, and ran on while staying on her left lead for place. SOL HOPE got bumped
by an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the four path, was roused early into the turn, swung from the five path into the lane, and finished evenly for
show. DAVID'S ROSE rated in the three path, steadied between foes around the nine sixteenths point, and made no impact from the five path in the stretch.
RESTOFTHESTORY tracked along the rail but did not threaten. ALWAYZ LATE chased in the five path but did not threaten. LIGHTNIN RUNNER pressed
in the three path but faded turning into the stretch.

MATTINGLY settled off the pace while racing two wide, tipped three wide to advance nearing the quarter pole, angled further out in upper stretch, seized
command leaving the eighth pole, drifted out nearing the sixteenth marker and drove clear. OKIRO raced off the pace two and three wide, swung five wide
turning for home, rallied outside, steadied off the winner's heels nearing the sixteenth pole and could not gain any further on that foe from there. ESPERON
set the pace in the two path to midstretch and was outfinished. PREVENT raced in range inside and lacked the needed rally. EL PRINCIPITO failed to
menace while racing three and four wide. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF OKIRO AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
DREAMBIGORGOHOME broke out at the start, rated in the two path, was roused early into the turn, cut the corner turning into the stretch, rallied up the
rail, and was up in the closing stages. SUPER SPIN set the pace inside, tipped out to the two path rounding the turn, was cued passing the quarter, opened
slightly while floating out to the five path into the lane, stayed on, but drifted in under right handed cues inside the final furlong, and was caught in the closing
stages to place. UNIFIEDS PRINCESS trailed in the three path, was driven in the five path around the turn, fanned out to the nine path into the lane, and
kept on for show. BRITISH EMPRESS broke out at the start, chased in the five path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, angled out to the eight path
in upper stretch, but was one paced on her left lead. MISS BIA stalked in the five path, was cued midway around the turn, swung out to the seven path into
the lane, but faded. LONGING FOR MINTS pressed in the three path, was driven between foes passing the quarter, but gaveway in upper stretch. BLACK
AND SILVER ducked in at the start, raced wellback in the three path, shifted to the rail early into the turn, but was eased entering the lane.
