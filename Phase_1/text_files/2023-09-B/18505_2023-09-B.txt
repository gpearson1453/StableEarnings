FOREST ran at the back of the pack had a mild gain at the beginning of the stretch. LENDA HAND had a slight hop to the break then quickly made up
ground on the outside and went around the rail three wide and tried to make a bid on the outside. MS JAZZ ran two wide in the middle of the pack around
the turn then slowly shuffled back. ICY REBEL just ran out of gas towards the late end of the race. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

HIT BTWEEN THE ICE came around the corner four wide and then slightly bumped HALF COURT SAM in the middle of the stretch but had a strong
outside drive. GATLING GOLD started out in the back of the pack then made a strong bid on the inside to make up tons of ground. HALF COURT SAM ran
in the middle of the pack on the outside but slightly got bumped on the outside but still made up a very good distance. MAJORWAYHOME ran on the rail
dueled with STYLE BENDER around the turn and partially down the stretch. STYLE BENDER caught the leaders quick then pressed the pace in the two
path around the turn then spread out and shuffled back. TSUNAMI GOLD pressed the pace early on and thru the turn then coming on the stretch slowed
slightly. CANYON DEL ORO was just out pace later into the race started falling back late stretch. HIT A NOTE started in the middle of the pack then as the
race progressed just got out ran. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY ON HIT BTWEEN THE ICE BUMPING HALF COURT SAM ON THE STRETCH,
THEY DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO LOSS IN PLACING AND RULED NO CHANGE. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED. PER RULING
ECM2023-185/ECM FROM THE NEW MEXICO RACING COMMISSION, HIT BTWEEN THE ICE WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

made a strong final drive. NATION OF LAWS pressed the pace of ISLA JANE then over took with fifty yards left in the race. ISLA JANE ran with early speed
in the two path with the constant pressure from foes on each side continued to hold the lead up until the last fifty yards. CAIRO MOON ran on the rail, then
had a late bid coming down the stretch. WON SASSY RIDE had a mild gain throughout the race in the two path. MAUI SUNRISE bumped SHAME ON
CHARLOTTE at the start then took to the outside and pressed the pace pf ISLA JANE then faded with a hundred yards left. LUCKY AND DARING was in
the middle of the pack as the race progressed slowly shuffled back. MOBILEAGILEHOSTILE ran evenly throughout the race even with a slower break than
