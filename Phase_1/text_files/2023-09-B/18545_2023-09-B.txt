Footnotes
REVOLT AND RIOT blew from the gate then set the early pace and continued to hold a comfortable lead. MAGIC IS FLYING ran off pace then at the three
eighths pole he lugged into other foes which caused them to check and lose positions. BARNFIELD ran in the middle of the pack then at the start of the
stretch started to kick and make up ground. GO LAKER GO ran with a mild gain throughout the race on the outside. GOLDEN MERGER ran in the middle of
the pack then at roughly at the three eighths pole MAGIC IS FLYING impeded and caused rider to check. AUDACE ran evenly throughout the race in the
middle of the pack. ABSTRACT KAT ran at the back of the pack then coming on to the stretch had a bid to make up some ground. ABETEMARCO ran at
the back of the pack then mid way thru the stretch had a little kick to close distance between foes. DIXIEMAGIC ran off pace on the rail but at the beginning
of the stretch faded back losing ground. TALE OF TRUTH ran in the middle of the pack but when MAGIC IS FLYING cut ahead of GOLDEN MERGER
caused both riders to check and find a new path in result of the rider checking lost some ground. MASTERCLASS trailed at the back of the pack had little
interest in the race. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND TRAINERS OBJECTION ON MAGIC IS FLYING, THE TRAINER OF GOLDEN MERGER
CALLED FOUL ON MAGIC IS FLYING DUE TO IMEPEDING PATH, THE STEWARDS DETERMINED TO SET MAGIC IS FLYING DOWN TO TENTH
PLACE BEHIND TALES OF TRUTH FOR IMPEDING PATH. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
