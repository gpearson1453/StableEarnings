ULTIMATE BREEZE gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path, dug in leaving the turn and finished strong to get up under
the wire. LIKELY CHOICE ducked in leaving the gate and made contact with Howsafearemycolors then pressured the pace, raced close off the rail on the
turn, was forced out into the lane, dueled to a brief slim lead near mid-stretch but was nipped under the wire. BESTLA accelerated to the lead at the five
sixteenths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, drifted a bit leaving the turn, was met toward mid-stretch and flattened stride the final
sixteenth. HOWSAFEAREMYCOLORS was bumped leaving the gate then gave chase, raced in the five path on the turn and passed rivals outside. MY
BOSS gave chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail then flattened stride. SWEET SPIN chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn and showed little
in the lane. KYMMIES CHARDONNAY set a pressured pace most of the opening quarter mile but was met a the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn off
the rail and weakened in the lane. SMOOKIE veered outward leaving the gate and gave chase to no avail.

Footnotes
FELICIAS CASTLE was bumped leaving the gate and settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, steadily
improved in the three path on the far turn and dug in under steady stretch handling to get up later yards. HARPERSGONEFISHING tapered in and raced
with the pace, dueled at even terms leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in determinedly to edge out
LASTWALKTOFREEDOM through the stretch but was caught in late yards. The latter tapered in and raced with the pace two deep, dueled at even terms
leaving the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage through the far turn but dug in gamely to the wire. DOCTOR PARDO ducked out leaving
the gate and made contact with Felicias Castle, rounded the first turn about the three path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and raced in the
four and five paths on the far turn, left the turn outside and finished evenly to close the gap. COMEONTURNMELOOSE saved ground off the pace, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. HILLBILLY ROCK saved ground, picked up the chase approaching
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and weakened. ALDRINALINE raced in the four path the first turn, left the turn outside and showed
little response through the backstretch. MEETMARYSMAN raced off the rail on the opening turn and faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY BEAUTY stalked off the rail on the opening turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole and took over at the five sixteenths, dueled clear
approaching the eighth pole and was kept alert through the lane. MAKANI rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was
met at the five sixteenths and dueled at even terms from that point, but dropped back at the rail approaching the head of the lane and flattened the final
sixteenth. MITOLE CANDY raced off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the
rail and flattened stride in the lane. VICE ON ICE saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four
path on the far turn and showed little further. ANOTHER FINE JUBA rounded the first turn in the five path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then
faded at the rail on the far turn. LIGHTNIN QUEEN lunged at the break, rounded the first turn about the four path and showed little response through the
backstretch. GIRLS PERFUME raced off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened off the rail on the far
turn. CEDAR'S IMAGE raced well off the pace and never factored. MISS INTENSITY was never a factor. WAY OF APPEAL stalked three wide on the

Footnotes
CEDAR'S WISH took over leaving the chute and set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the turn and held well under steady stretch handling. EMBERLY
pressured the pace, raced close two deep on the turn but hung at the outside flank of the winner through the lane. RIVER REWARDS RVF gave chase,
raced in range of the lead about the three path on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. WINDSOR'S PLAY chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn then
flattened the final sixteenth. SIENTE LA BRISA gave chase, rounded the turn in the four path and weakened in the stretch. PURE NONSENSE chased
inside, entered the turn off the rail, drifted leaving the turn and showed little more. IRISH VALENTINE chased outside, raced in the five path on the turn and
weakened. SUPERSTASIA was not a factor. MAP THE MOMENT lunged at the break, gave chase while being eased to the outside and rounded the turn
about the six path.

DON'TCALLTOOEARLY came out and made contact with Just Juba leaving the gate, raced off the rail on the opening turn and gave chase into the
backstretch, took the lead three wide midway on the far turn and dug in determinedly to edge out the stretch challenge of VAGABOND VIRGIN, who saved
ground just off the pace on the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, improved in the four path on the far turn and dueled
gamely to late stretch before relenting. LEG UP raced with the early pace two deep while between horses then dropped back into the first turn, picked up the
chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then flattened in the lane. REY O REYES raced with the early pace three wide
then took the lead two deep into the backstretch, was met toward the five sixteenths pole, dropped back at the rail approaching the head of the lane and
weakened leaving the turn. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the four and five paths,
then flattened stride. TREASURER settled off the rail the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and took a
slim lead past the five sixteenths, but was met off the rail midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane. SPECTACULO came in leaving the gate and
made contact with Just Juba then raced with the pace inside, was met leaving the first turn, gave chase from that point but dropped back toward the three
eighths pole and gave way. JUST JUBA was jostled leaving the gate and never factored.

Footnotes
NAPA VALLEY exchanged contact with Vail Of Honor leaving the gate then closed to the lead approaching the three quarter pole and rated the pace, was
met into the backstretch, dueled from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and held on well under steady handling. MARK DID IT had a
brief early lead inside but was met approaching the three quarter pole and stalked, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths, rounded the far turn
near the rail, eased out into the lane and just lasted for second. VAIL OF HONOR exchanged contact with Napa Valley leaving the gate and dropped well
back from early contention, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily progressed, rounded the far turn about the three path and could only
close the gap in the stretch. GRAN ANDREWS raced in the four path the opening turn then stalked two deep into the second turn, moved to even terms into
the backstretch, dueled from the three eighths pole but dropped back in the three path midway on the far turn and weakened in the lane. NEW YORK
PANTHER rated close off the rail, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. TAPADINE raced off the pace inside and
showed little response through the backstretch. AUBURN MILL got loose in the post parade, raced in the five path the first two turns and was through after a
half mile.

Footnotes
JUST HAVE FAITH settled back in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole and improved at the rail on the
far turn, dug in under steady encouragement from the head of the lane and took over late yards. VERY VENUS took over toward the three quarter pole and
rated a slim lead off the rail, drew clear toward the three eighths pole, came under pressure past the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn and was
steadily handled in the lane, but was caught late yards. OUR BREW stalked the earlier pace from the three path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened in the lane. FAR MORE saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths
pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and flattened in the lane. OPPO TACO settled in the three path the opening turn, gave chase leaving the half
mile pole but weakened into the far turn. FLATTERING WAY came away erratically and showed little response through the backstretch. LIL SPITTIN
IMAGE showed little response. STORMI VANNA rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, weakened at the rail
approaching the quarter pole and was eased.
