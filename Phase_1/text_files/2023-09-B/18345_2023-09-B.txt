Footnotes
JAYS ANGEL broke in at the start and was off a step slowly, tracked the solid pace from the inside, maintained a rail path to the quarter marker, advanced
in upper stretch and vied for the lead nearing the furlong pole, took command approaching the sixteenth-marker and held on for the win at the finish.
NAUGHTY NIKO stalked the solid early pace while outside of rivals, was steered three wide to the quarter marker, was guided four wide into the stretch and
lost position heading to the furlong marker, re-rallied in the final stages, closed well in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while holding clearly for
second. WART was asked for speed leaving the break and pressed the solid early pace from the inside, disputed the fractions while saving ground to the
quarter marker, tipped to the two path for the drive and held a narrow lead at the furlong grounds, could not hold off JAYS ANGEL approaching the sixteenth
marker and gave way, while just holding for third at the finish. HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE settled off of the solid early pace, chased two wide on the turn,
swung to the five path for the stretch drive, offered a late bid and just missed for third. STORMY JOE was sent to assume command in the early running, set
solid fractions while pressured to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch, chased to the furlong pole and faded in deep stretch.

Footnotes
DIAMOND CONCERTO angled to the inside leaving the start, settled off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, raced along the inside while
never far back through the backstretch run, was guided to the three path heading into the far turn, waited a bit for racing room nearing the quarter marker,
swung six wide into the stretch, was given his cue at the top of the lane and ran evenly to mid-stretch, was full of run inside of the furlong marker, collared
the runner-up at the sixteenth-marker and won going away at the finish. KLIMT A. P. was forwardly placed leaving the start, prompted the modest fractions
from a two wide path along the backstretch run, confronted the pacesetter along the far turn and took command into upper stretch, was set down at the
furlong marker and showed the way into deep stretch, was collared by DIAMOND CONCERTO approaching the sixteenth-marker, could not match strides
with the winner in deep stretch and was outfinished, while besting the rest. CATTIN ALL AROUND was asked to show speed leaving the break and
assumed command in the early stages, slowed the pace down into the first turn and set modest fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, was
confronted by KLIMT A. P. approaching the quarter marker, lost the lead to that rival into upper stretch, chased to the furlong grounds, weakened in deep
stretch and just held for third. VERITAS AEQUITAS broke through the gate prior to the start, was crowded at the start and was off a bit slowly, was
unhurried in the early stages, tracked the modest pace while outside of rivals through the backstretch run, mounted a four wide bid approaching the quarter
marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final stages and just missed for third at the finish. SPIDER PIG settled off of the early pace and raced
outside of rivals into the first turn, tracked four wide through the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid along the far turn and came within aim
approaching the quarter marker, could not sustain that run into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. PUDDIN HEAD JONES settled just off of the
early pace and raced between runners into the first turn, tracked between runners through the backstretch run and was guided two wide and between rivals
into the far turn, came in tight nearing the quarter marker and was boxed in approaching the top of the stretch, chased the leaders to mid-stretch, was shut
off and took up heading to the furlong pole and could not muster a response in deep stretch. ROAD HOUSE broke out and crowded VERITAS AEQUITAS
leaving the start and was a bit keen in the early running, raced on a hold into the backstretch run, settled just off of the moderate pace while saving ground
into the far turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

J AND M EXPRESS assumed command in the early stages, showed the way into the first turn and set a prompted pace into the backstretch run, shook free
and was well handled through moderate fractions approaching the half-mile marker, was confronted by I'M GONNA SHINE nearing the quarter marker, met
that bid into upper stretch and battled with that foe heading to the furlong grounds, shook free into deep stretch, was kept to task in the final sixteenth and
held in a drive over the oncoming runner-up. OH ANGEL rated nicely off of the early pace, raced four deep into the first turn then angled to the rail and
saved ground into the backstretch run, tracked through the backstretch run and was guided outside of rivals into the far turn, came four wide into the stretch,
ran evenly to the furlong pole while within aim, finished well, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and held clearly for second at the finish. I'M GONNA
SHINE was asked for speed leaving the start and was forwardly placed into the first turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run, gained
ground on the pacesetter along the far turn and confronted J AND M EXPRESS at the quarter marker, was repelled in that bid into upper stretch and chased
to mid-stretch, could not make headway on J AND M EXPRESS in the final furlong, weakened in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second, while
clear of the rest for third. SILVER FLIRT settled just off of the early pace and stalked from the inside, was well placed through the backstretch run, gained
ground approaching the quarter marker, could not keep pace with the leaders into the stretch and lacked a late rally. BILLY GALLIVAN settled in the second
flight in the early stages and raced three wide along the first turn, tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run while never far back, was coaxed
along two then three wide to the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and did not offer a response in the final stages. HARBOR DEAREST was
forwardly placed leaving the break, was keen in the early running and pulled on the rider while between runners into the first turn, settled into the
backstretch run and tracked the decent pace to the far turn, chased from the rail into upper stretch and did not threaten. ADAPTED MEMORY was leaning
at the start, broke awkwardly and was away slowly, settled outside of runners in the early stages, lugged out along the first turn and lost contact with the
field into the backstretch run, trailed to the quarter marker, raced in the five path into upper stretch and did not factor. CHERRY CHAOS was prominent
leaving the start and stalked the early pace while three deep into the first turn, attended to the pace into the backstretch run, lost position heading to the
half-mile marker, was outrun on the second turn and came up empty in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
HONEYMOONZ OVER seized the lead from the break, set a reasonable pace a length or two clear to the turn while racing well in hand, fended off
challengers early in the stretch run then battled gamely between horses in the final yards and prevailed in a gutsy effort. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD settled
right behind the pacesetter to the turn, went to challenge the leader from the five-sixteenths marker, engaged on the outside down the stretch, battled
willingly to the wire but was denied. LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM raced on the rail and up close through the turn, responded when roused at the top of the stretch
was inside of a three-horse battle down the stretch and was out-nodded at the line. BOBBY'S ALIBI was off a step slow then outrun in the early stages,
raced near the back of a tight field, took the two path through the turn, responded when roused in the stretch but could not make up the needed ground.
TORPEDO AWAY broke well then dropped off the pace, was last of a very compact field going into the turn, launched a five wide rally into the stretch and
ran on well but was outfinished. SLEW'S JOY broke a beat slow then came out awkwardly, once righted rushed up to join the pack racing in the three path,
came into the stretch in good position but then could not keep up in the late stages.

Footnotes
CHARBONNEAU broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set decent fractions while off of the rail into the backstretch run, was well handled while
showing the way into the second turn, felt pressure from OH GREAT at the quarter marker, came in a bit in upper stretch and crowded that rival, was set
down for the drive, shook free at the furlong marker, drew to a clear lead approaching the sixteenth-pole, was kept to task in the final strides and held safely
in a drive at the finish. INCREDIBLE SHOT settled inside of rivals in the early stages, came in tight along the far turn while two then three wide, slipped to
the rail into upper stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, closed well in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final stages and just held
for second at the finish. O B'S was bumped by MOVIETIME and was off slowly, was unhurried while saving ground into the first turn, was content to trail
through the backstretch run, improved position on the far turn, swung seven wide for the stretch drive, closed willingly in the final stages, just missed for
second at the finish and was up just in time to secure third. KO SAMUI (IRE) tracked the early pace from the inside, improved position on the backstretch
run, saved all of the ground to the far turn, tipped two wide for the stretch drive and ran evenly to the furlong marker, offered a late bid in the final sixteenth
but was outfinished and just missed for the minor awards. UNCLE WALT settled inside in the early stages, improved position on the backstretch, saved
ground into the far turn, angled four wide for the stretch drive, showed good late interest but was unable to impact the leaders in the final stages. OH
GREAT (IRE) showed early speed and prompted the decent pace from the inside, kept attendance to CHARBONNEAU through the backstretch run, ran in
pursuit along the far turn and confronted CHARBONNEAU nearing the quarter marker, steadied slightly in upper stretch when that foe came in a bit, chased
CHARBONNEAU to the furlong marker, could not make headway on the winner in deep stretch and weakened late. LIMITED HEATWAVE was allowed to
settle in the early running, was guided four wide to the quarter marker then slipped to the rail into upper stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker and
continued to improve position in the final sixteenth. STRAIT OF GEORGIA was forwardly placed in the early going and tracked outside of rivals into the first
turn, came three wide into the backstretch run, lost position heading to the half--mile marker, was coaxed along two then three wide approaching the quarter
pole, lost ground into the stretch and did not offer a late rally. CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN settled in the second flight, was coaxed along three wide into the far
turn, raced six wide into the stretch, came in tight while between runners at mid-stretch, checked at the furlong marker and did not factor in the final stages.
MOVIETIME broke in at the start and bumped with O B'S, stalked the early pace while outside of rivals, improved position along the backstretch run, gave
chased along the far turn, swung to the five path into upper stretch, dropped back nearing the furlong marker and came up empty in deep stretch.

Footnotes
BOSS OF THEMOSS broke well, pressed the early pace from between horses then took a short lead approaching the half mile marker, pulled away from
the field with MOB BOSS to the inside, drifted out a bit in the stretch, was able to stay just in front of that stubborn foe for the length of the stretch run and
held for the win. MOB BOSS broke sharply and gained the early advantage, responded when BOSS OF THEMOSS bid for the lead near the half then
traded jabs with that one from the seven-sixteenths pole to the finish, battled well but could not overhaul the winner. THE SANDY SURPRISE was away
slowly after the break, fell behind despite the best efforts of the rider to inspire some speed, found a good rhythm with three furlongs to run, swung four wide
into the stretch and produced a good rally to get up for the show. EXTRA INNINGS was away well and was intent on joining the pace duel then forced to
steady near the nine-sixteenths pole when OBVIOUS came over, dropped back a few lengths at that point, re-rallied through the turn, got an inside run into
the stretch, tipped out to make a run at the leaders, had to dodge BOSS OF THEMOSS when that one drifted out then ran on well but was outfinished for
the third spot. EL BERRINCHES broke well but could not match strides with the pacesetters in the early stages, was being pushed to hold position, then
started to rally in the turn, swung to the three path in the stretch, ran on some but stalled and finished evenly. SURPRISE FASHION broke inward at the
start, fell behind early, chased the field to the stretch and never made an impact. OBVIOUS was up on the pace racing three wide, held position to the turn,
had trouble keeping passing the five-sixteenths pole, weakened and dropped back through the field.

Footnotes
STOIC LUNA settled just off of the early pace while tracking from the inside, was well positioned while saving ground through the backstretch run, gained
ground along the far turn, waited for racing room nearing the top of the stretch and was coaxed along to the two path into upper stretch, chased the leaders
to the furlong marker, shifted to the three path and responded to firm urging into deep stretch, closed with a rush in the final sixteenth and was up in the final
strides to prevail. NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) was away from the start in good order and raced close to the early pace, prompted MADEIRA WINE through
moderate fractions along the backstretch run and drew to even terms with her stablemate nearing the quarter marker, battled with MADEIRA WINE into
upper stretch then took command approaching the furlong marker, was kept to task under steady right-handed urging into the final sixteenth, was all out to
hold off STOIC LUNA in deep stretch and was tagged in the final strides for the win, while holding safely for second. MADEIRA WINE assumed command
away from the start, set a moderate pace while prompted into the backstretch run, was confronted by NAUGHTY NADINE along the far turn, met that foe's
bid into upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker, weakened in the final sixteenth and just held for third at the finish. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE was
allowed to settle, saved ground into the backstretch run while not far back, saved all of the ground to the far turn, ran evenly to the furlong pole, shifted to
the two path approaching the final sixteenth, offered a late bid in deep stretch and just missed for third. MOMMA MOCCA settled outside of rivals while just
off of the early pace, gained ground while two wide along the far turn, swung three wide for the stretch drive and lost position at the furlong marker, re-rallied
in the final sixteenth but was outkicked in deep stretch. ASSIGNATION settled two wide into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run and
was steered two wide into the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch drive, lost ground at the furlong marker, re-bid in deep stretch but could not
muster the needed late response.

Footnotes
ANTHONY'S BEST broke well but shied a bit when O'BANION (IRE) came over at the break, was in the early mix but then was content to sit off the
developing pace duel, took to the three path on the turn, rallied to challenge for the lead passing the quarter pole, went head and head with O'BANION (IRE)
for the length of the stretch, gained a short lead mid-stretch then held the resurgent rival at bay to the wire. O'BANION (IRE) broke in then was quick away
and gained the lead early with a quartet in hot pursuit, was joined by R HEART OF GOLD to the outside through the turn, and briefly ceded the lead to that
one, re-bid passing the quarter pole but then had to contend with a surging ANTHONY'S BEST on the outside, fought back gamely but came up a head
short. ONE BIG SMILE was always prominent to the inside, had to idle behind horses while full of run, found an opening on the rail turning for home and
chased the top pair to the wire well clear of the next horse. PLAYBOY STYLE was a little slow to get going then fell behind, was being encouraged by the
rider to keep contact with the field, made up some ground on the turn, tipped out to the three path into the stretch and rallied into better position in deep
stretch. UNCLE DUSAN came away well but was allowed to settle into stride, raced mid-pack down the backstretch, then launched a mild rally through the
turn, came into the stretch four wide, had a little trouble changing leads at the top of the stretch and could not keep up in the late stages. RACER REX broke
a bit slow then had ANTHONY'S BEST take the path a few strides after the break, chased through the turn while saving ground, was kept to task but could
not make an impact. R HEART OF GOLD broke well, raced close up in the early going, took over the lead passing the half mile marker, held through the
turn then tired badly in the stretch.
