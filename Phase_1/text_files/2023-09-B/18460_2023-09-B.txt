Footnotes
GIRLS IN CHARGE stalked the clear leader in the early going, edged closer late on the turn, given cue three wide at the head of the lane, responded
willingly, cleared command approaching the furlong marker and finished going away. BLOW SUM SMOKE was reserved racing in the back, picked up the
tempo late on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied along the outside and got up for place. TRIP TO FREEDOM cleared the lead out of the
gate and quickly pulled away, continued with a commanding advantage around the turn, got collared by the winner past upper stretch and gave way.
NORTHERN GEM came away last then was ridden on the inside into the turn, saved ground turning for home, sustained a steady inside bid through the
lane and got nipped for show. UNHERDOF raced off the early pace, came three wide into the lane and never threatened.

Footnotes
I LOVE ROCKNSTROLL stalked the pace around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued three wide in contention around the far turn, came under
left handed pressure in upper stretch, kicked in gamely approaching the sixteenth pole and finished going away. APOLLO BAY raced well off the early pace,
picked up the tempo on the inside around the far turn, steadily edged up closer along the rail through the lane and got a nose up for place. DIXIE THREE G
prompted the pace around the first turn and up the backstretch, hustled along two wide around the far turn, sustained bid into stretch run and got nipped for
place. LOUD BOY set the pace with some pressure being applied up the backstretch, held firm around the far turn, roused for more turning for home,
responded, edged away to a clear lead then came up empty late. WHONEW was well reserved through early and middle stages, swung six wide into upper
stretch and finished with some late interest. PISTOL PACKIN MAN lacked speed, raced in the back and had no response. BRILLIANT COLORS raced near
midpack in early stages, failed to advance when called upon around the far turn and steadily faded. STAR MISSION raced off the top trio up the
backstretch, weakened around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
KOSELIO saved ground around the first turn and settled while nicely rated up the backstretch, tipped out and circled up three to four wide at the quarter
pole, took command turning for home, widened to a clear advantage and continued to pull away while ridden out. AWESOME FAMILY dueled for the lead
around the first turn then edged back into stalking position, remained forwardly placed up the backstretch then weakened inside around the final turn,
launched a two wide rebid at the head of the lane and finished clearly second best. LEAVEITONTHEFIELD tracked the top trio up the backstretch, made a
move for command mid-way around the far turn, briefly held the lead then got collared by the winner near the quarter pole, weakened off the top pair in the
lane but held onto a share. HERZEN raced four wide around the first turn, settled off the early pace, hustled up four wide late on the far turn, raced in range
then failed to sustain bid into the lane. BILLY YANK raced in the back, swung five wide into upper stretch and passed tiring foes. MINE MY TIME stalked the
pace up the backstretch, made a bid around the far turn then gave way in the lane. INCITATUS vied for the lead around the first turn then set the pace up
the backstretch, got collared around the far turn and tired in the drive.

IRON LOTUS set a pressured pace in opening stages and continued around the turn, shook free turning for home, widened advantage on top and stayed on
gamely to prevail under a driving finish. TAKING CHARGE DESI lacked room along the rail and steadied in early stages, got clear and hustled up on the
inside around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, finished with good response but could not get to the winner. PEGGY RULES raced off the early
leaders, cut the corner entering the lane, sustained an inside bid and cleared a share. EUROWENDI lagged behind the field in early stages, hustled up into
the lane and improved late. PRINCESSOFCHITOWN pressed the pace in opening stages, continued in striking distance around the turn, was no match for
eventual winner turning for home and flattened in the lane. MILLIGANMIKEANDME raced off the early pace, advanced four wide around the turn then gave
way in the lane. DIAMOND OF EKATI raced in contention and chase between rivals around the turn then weakened in the drive. ANNIEWAY U WANT IT
chased three to four wide around the turn then faded. IVY ABAD GIRL was forwardly placed in early stages, weakened past the mid-way point on the turn
and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
MACHO FORTY FIVE briefly pressed the pace on the inside then edged back, tracked the leader and tipped two wide mid-way around the turn, launched a
rebid for SANGRIA SKY entering the head of the lane, reached equal terms at the sixteenth pole then kicked clear. SANGRIA SKY briefly raced under
pressure then edged away entering the turn, saved ground turning for home, held clear a furlong out then got outkicked deep stretch. CINCO DE MO was
off a step slow at the start ad raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, gained closer contention and sustained a steady inside bid to prevail for a
share. NATIVE HELLRAISER raced off the pace in early stages, edged close and chased between rivals around the turn, hustled along three wide into
upper stretch, ran on but lacked the needed kick for serious impact. SPANISH KISS chased in contention into the turn, sustained a four wide bid past the
quarter pole then gave way. ROWDY RAY was unsettled behind the gate, lost the rider and momentarily got loose but was quickly apprehended, was away
in good order and chased in close contention, sustained bid around the turn then retreated in the lane.

DAVIDIC LINE sped to the lead heading into the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch, continued well rated on top racing under a snug hold around
the far turn, saved ground turning for home, ran on two wide under a drive while tiring late but held safe. STRINGS raced two wide up close around the first
turn then tracked then pace to the far turn, hustled along two wide into upper stretch, sustained a determined three wide through the lane but failed to get by
the winner. DOUBLE THUNDER stalked the pacesetter around the first turn and continued up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid near the quarter
pole, angled inside at the head of the lane, sustained a steady bid and just lasted for show. CALIFORNIA SWING raced off the early pace, swung five wide
into upper stretch, finished with response and just missed show. IRISH VALOR rated near midpack through early stages, hustled up three wide around the
far turn then ran on evenly through the lane. FAKE SOLUTION settled through early and middle stages, hustled along four wide into the lane, angled inside
near the eighth pole and needed more for late impact. HEZA WILD RIDE failed to move into contention. REVENIR was forwardly placed around the first
turn, tracked the pace up the backstretch, faded around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive.
