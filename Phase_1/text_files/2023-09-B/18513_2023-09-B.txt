Footnotes
NEON DEION well placed and off the rail, angled out and moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain,
edged ahead inside the furlong marker, then drew off late. CLOUD IN THE WIND stalked the early pace on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead
through the turn, held sway to the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner and held the place. EMPTY MY POUCH unhurried, looped up four wide
through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed the place. COOLKID mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn,
came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. POLIE sent from the gate, set the pace inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then faded the
final furlong. MR. NORMANDY was never involved.

Footnotes
ADIOS BOBBY sprinted away from the field in the early going, stayed on when challenged at the furlong marker, came again late, edged ahead and held.
EL SOLITARIO allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, dueled, then edged up for the place in the
final strides. SIDE TRACKED well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain,
edged ahead at the furlong marker, then weakened late and held the show. CEDUNA well placed and off the rail, gained position on the two path through
the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, dueled, then weakened late and held a share. CUZ steadied through the fist turn, tracked the pace, lost
some ground through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and evened out. BATTLE CREEK fractious in the gate,
steadied at the start, passed tiring rivals. ENGLISH LAUGHTER was no factor. OPEN OUT was never involved.
