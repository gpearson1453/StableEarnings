speed in the two path. REVOLT AND RIOT ran off pace in the three path then slowly faded roughly at the middle of the turn. STOCK DEAL had a mild gain
from the back of the pack pass a few foes. MONEY LENDER maintained a steady pace just traded with STOCK DEAL as they picked up speed.

maintained a steady pace on the rail then faded coming on to the stretch. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
