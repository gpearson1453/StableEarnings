Footnotes
CAITLINHERGRTNESS showed early speed, was taken in hand briefly when MISCHIEVOUS MISS passed in front nearing the three-quarter pole then
switched to the outside, moved up to make a bid with five furlongs to run, took the lead at the seven-sixteenths, controlled the action in the two path on the
turn, dropped closer to the rail coming to the quarter-pole, responded well when set down in upper stretch and held under steady urging. BACKSTRETCH
ROSE was last to commence, moved out while settling towards the rear, shifted from three to five wide on the turn, was roused late on that bend, advanced
into upper stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth but missed. NIKITIS climbed some near the three-quarter pole,
settled under some coaxing, was roused for more in the two path on the turn, raced between horses inside the three-eighths, pursued the winner under a
drive in the stretch and was out-kicked. HELCIA was forwardly placed on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch
then moved further out under a drive and lacked the needed kick. KINGDOM COME moved out then settled on the outside, was asked in the four path on
the turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and came up empty. CLASSY MISCHIEF settled at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the
turn, came three wide into upper stretch and was no factor. MISCHIEVOUS MISS moved to the front before leaving the chute then angled in coming to the
three-quarter pole, showed the way down the backstretch, lost the lead while inside early on the turn, checked while dropping out of contention in the vicinity
of the five-sixteenths and stopped.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL KAREN coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace four wide outside the top pair, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, dug in head to
head taking command just inside the three-sixteenths, fought on with SUE ELLEN MISHKIN latched on to her inside, came in under a right handed crop to
impede that rival just inside the sixteenth marker forcing that foe to check out along the rail and inched away in the late stages to prevail. ICY REPLY
coaxed from the start, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home, offered up a mild kick to secure the place
honors. SUE ELLEN MISHKIN showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from AWESOME INDRA and then a pair when joined by the top
one, took the inside route into upper stretch, got headed for command just inside the three-sixteenths, fought on latched on to the inside of BEAUTIFUL
KAREN and had that rival come in under a right handed crop a sixteenth out, got forced to check in tight along the rail when impeded and lost all momentum
late getting shaken off and collared for the place honors while along for the show. AWESOME INDRA prompted the pace of the aforementioned foe from the
outside two to three wide and then between foes when placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in the midst of
being shaken off, then weakened in the late stages. TIMED OUT bobbled at the break getting away last and conceding four lengths to the front before
settling into stride, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid, then
was reported to have bled. BOWL OF CHERRIES coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four
wide into upper stretch, weakened. MISS DOMINA hustled from the gate, grew eager pulling on the bit along the inside when off heels of SUE ELLEN
MISHKIN early on, came under coaxing midway on the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. DIVA BANKER coaxed from the gate,
chased five wide under a ride from three furlongs out, swung six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch
run focusing on BEAUTIFUL KAREN as well as a claim of foul by the rider of SUE ELLEN MISHKIN alleging interference against BEAUTIFUL KAREN. After
review, the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

QUALITY CHIC prompted the pace on the outside of the leader, turned up the pressure in the four path on the turn, took over into upper stretch, shook clear
under a right-handed crop into the final furlong then came inward before being switched to a left-handed crop and drew away under steady handling.
MALIBU SPRINGS went to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied in the three path while urged along on the turn, lost the advantage
into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong then moved out behind the winner and proved no match. WHENLOVETAKESOVER angled to the
outside late in the chute, tossed his head under tight restraint while moving up alongside the other two foes nearing the three-quarter pole, stalked the pace
on the outside, was given his cue in the five path on the turn, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and came up empty.

on to secure the place honors. ABADIN vied inside a trio early on before establishing sole command with five and a half furlongs to go, showed the way in

preserve the show honors. LUNI SIMA chased four to five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch,
weakened in the late stages. CERTIFIED LOVERBOY got brushed at the start by SUNDAESWITHSANDY, who broke outwards, vied briefly to the six

Footnotes
MOONLIGHT veered out at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the three path on the turn, took the lead into upper stretch,
shook clear outside the furlong marker, drew away under urging into the final forty yards then was eased up while much the best. MALARCHUK was last
away then bobbled after the start, established position just off the pace on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, chased in the four path on
the turn and earned the place while no match for the winner. STOLEN MAGIC veered out at the start, went to the front, showed the way under pressure,
vied in the two path while asked on the turn, lost the lead into upper stretch and tired. LIVE TO RIDE (GB) broke in at the start, settled off the pace, saved
ground under urging on the turn and came up empty. ROCKET NIGHT broke in at the start, settled at the back, was urged along in the two path on the turn
and was no factor. MARCEAU broke in at the start, moved to the outside leaving the chute, was urged four to five wide on the turn and capitulated.
SKYLER'S ARTEMIS broke in at the start, was well placed towards the front, went three to four wide under urging on the turn and had nothing left.
QUOKKA broke in at the start, prompted the pace on the inside, dropped back near the three-quarter pole, came up empty in the two path on the turn and
faltered.

Footnotes
DIGITIZE led early on five paths off the inside, then gave chase four then three wide in close aim of the leader, took back command near the quarter pole
and was placed to light urging swinging three wide into upper stretch, lugged in straightened away at the three-sixteenths while edging clear and was back
in hand inside the final furlong to prevail comfortably at the end. TWELTH MAN six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place
honors. FAMOUS GENT coaxed from the gate, chased briefly just off the inside before advancing to take over five furlongs from home, showed the way
from the two path and then along the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front near the quarter pole and spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. HIGHLY FLAMMABLE coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide for home and weakened. OCTOPUS chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, angled in to spin two to three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. PINE VALLEY coaxed from the gate, chased four then three
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
WIN FOR GOLD went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, responded well when asked for his best in
upper stretch and proved best under steady urging. DISARMED lost his footing at the start but broke towards the front, chased the pace down the
backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and was second best. BRONX BOMBER settled off
the pace, was roused four wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response while up for the show. RUNNINGWSCISSORS
settled off the pace, went three wide for most of the turn, shifted five wide over heels at the five-sixteenths and failed to rally. BAR FOURTEEN was urged
along off the pace, moved in outside the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. ZEEBEAR was urged along off the pace, went three
then two wide on the turn and failed to respond. FEATHERS ROAD was reserved towards the rear, went three wide for most of the turn, shifted six wide
near the five-sixteenths, moved to the eight path while going around a lugging out foe outside the quarter-pole and was no factor. MAXWELL ESQUIRE was
taken up at the start then dropped back, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and also was no factor. FOOLISH
GHOST was last to commence, raced on the far outside while ridden along, advanced late on the backstretch, went five wide on the turn and capitulated.
WINNERS LAUGH chased the pace, dropped back while lugging out from the four path to the seven path on the turn, came out further into upper stretch
and faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
STRAPPED coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, came in at
the three-sixteenths brushing with TIMO, then edged away under a drive to prevail. BOLT D'PLATA chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, ran on to be along well clear of the rest and second best. TIMO chased four to five paths off
the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch taking
over brief and narrow command, got headed straightened away and then was brushed at the three-sixteenths before weakening through to the finish.
AMERICAN DAY chased four to five wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened. THE ELUSIVE DRWONG
chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued two to three wide for home, tired. CONGRUENTE (ARG) coaxed from the
start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, made no impact. MAGIADORO hustled
from the gate, established the front and showed the way lightly coaxed in the two path, tucked inside into the turn, had the rider sense something amiss and
was placed to a protective hold midway on the bend, got altered out and eased up before being pulled up just inside the three-sixteenths marker, then was
subsequently vanned off.
