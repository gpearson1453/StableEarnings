Footnotes
RAT PORTAGE had a good position outside tracking the front pair rating kindly outside down the backside, cruised around horses midway on the turn three
wide to bid at the top of the lane, took over control outside at the furlong marker and had something left in reserve to hold off the challengers in deep stretch.
THREEFIFTYSEVEN tracked the front two on the rail down the back straight, waited inside behind the pacesetter through the turn ready to pounce, slipped
up the rail turning for home posing the main threat, finished with determination on the fence late but could not reel in the game winner late. MIDNIGHT
ARKLE stalked near the rear outside down the backstretch, began to lengthen stride closing in on rivals at the quarter marker, followed the path of the
winner outside four wide for the stretch drive and was full of run late closing in on the top two crossing the line. CEREBRO took command from the start,
dictated the pace around the bend while pressed outside,, was collared outside by the winner at the quarter pole, battled stubbornly between foes in upper
stretch, steadied briefly nearing the wire and held for a minor share at the finish. IT WORKED was unhurried to trail on the rail at the half, saved ground
making little headway though the turn, rallied up the fence down the lane, could not reach contention nearing the wire but finished with some interest to be
beaten not that far in the end. SPANISH PRINCE hounded the pace outside down the backstretch, continued to prompt two wide outside on the turn, was
scrubbed on with runners on either side trying to match strides at the quarter pole and gave way between foes in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
YORKVILLE had a good trip three deep outside watching the contesting pair at the half, coasted around horses in hand three wide to assume control at the
quarter pole, opened up on runners in upper stretch and finished up on the wrong lead easily holding on for the victory in the end. TREBUCHET broke a
step slow to begin, recovered to be in the second flight with rivals on either side tracking the front pair down the back straight, advanced in the two path
through the turn, could not reel in the winner who opened up on foes at the top of the stretch and stayed on to best the rest comfortably at the finish.
ARAMOS settled on the rail in the second flight watching the contested trio in the beginning, was throttled down in tight to be shuffled back at the seven
sixteenths marker, regrouped to improve on the fence midturn, angled out to the three path for the drive to the finish and closed in to capture third money.
DIXIE'S FLATTER pressed between in the early going, backed away with a half left to run to co-trail with horses on each side at the quarter pole and
resurged down the lane for a minor role in the end. SEATTLE DOWN UNDER was void of speed trailing down the back straight, caught up to the field three
wide midway on the turn, shifted out widest in the five path for the drive and passed the tired dueling early leaders down the stretch. HEEZESPEEDY
prompted three deep in the early going outside, pressed for the lead in the two path at the half, assumed the lead with three eighths remaining, offered no
resistance when the winner swooped by at the quarter pole, began to shorten stride at the top of the lane and stopped in the final sixteenth. DANCIN'
DEPUTY had a slim lead inside down the backstretch, surrendered the front on the rail with three eighths remaining, could not find anymore and retreated
on the fence at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
GABBY SQUARED had a good spot nestled on the rail watching the front pair in the beginning, waited to pounce inside running throughout the turn, slipped
up on the rail at the sixteenth pole and held safe in a well timed move in the stretch. MY SUNNY VALENTINE travelled three deep outside in midfield down
the backside, rallied around horses three wide on the turn, bid for the lead in the four path straightening out for the drive and determinedly fought to the wire
just missing out at the finish. GIZMO'S B F F was content tracking the lone speed down the backstretch, was hard ridden to quicken with others reeling in
the leader at the quarter pole, battled in the three path turning for home but needed more late to keep up and finished a game third at the wire. SILENT
GUROO broke out at the start, set the fractions down the back straight, was loose on the lead through the turn, began to tire in upper stretch, was
swallowed up fading in the two path by runners on each side closing in with a sixteenth remaining and held for a small share of the prize in the end.
EMERALD LAKE broke out brushing rival at the start, settled near the back inside in the early stages, made some progress saving ground throughout the
turn and was one paced in the drive to the wire. CLEOMENES broke in brushing foe to begin, stalked near the rear outside down the backstretch, made little
headway three wide on the turn and had nothing to give in the stretch drive. SYSTEMATIC hopped slightly to begin, threw head fighting the rider between
horses down the backstretch, settled through the turn making little impact and was not involved galloping to the wire in the stretch.

UNIFIED FRONT chased from near but off the inside two to three wide, moved out four wide late on the turn gaining on the leader, drifted out in upper
stretch, struck the front past the eighth pole, held. TAMANA raced mid-pack inside, dropped back entering the turn, came out for the stretch run, rallied
between runners in a solid late effort but was second best. HELLUVA HOLIDAY exchanged a bump at the start, settled at the back, was off the rail leaving
the turn, angled in once in upper stretch and rallied near the inside. LILLZ HOPE hesitated at the start, moved forward outside on the turn four then five
wide, fanned eight wide into upper stretch, evened out late. WANNA PLAY was reluctant to load, exchanged a bump at the start, advanced inside a rival late
up the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, came out at the top of the stretch then again nearing mid-stretch looking for room, ran on. STRIKE
THE POSE pursued the pace from outside three to five wide, weakened in the stretch. MAP broke sharply albeit a tad outwardly, quickly moved clear, set
the pace, came out a bit in upper stretch, wilted. GIVE ME THE BOOTS stalked the clear leader, was encouraged along at the quarter, came out three wide
at the top of the stretch, faded. THATSITTHATSALL moved off the inside, chased from mid-pack, dropped back three wide on the turn, tired.

DETERMINED FURY stalked from outside three to four wide through the turn, took the lead about the three-sixteenths, drifted out in mid-stretch but forged
clear. MR NARCISSISTIC stalked from between runners, was in contention two to three wide through the turn into upper stretch, proved no match but held
the place. MIA AND ME bumped the inner rival at the start, raced outside four wide into the turn fanning seven wide into upper stretch, kept on widest of all.
ADELAIDE COURT chased in behind mid-pack, encouraged along while tipping out a bit past the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch,
kicked on well but missed show honors. MIDNIGHT RAMBLIN was bumped into a rival at the start, moved out from three to six wide on the turn coming to
the top of the stretch between runners and within range, needed more late. MUSICAL STRIDE got away alertly, set the pace inside, was pressured through
the turn, weakened. STAR SCHOLAR was bumped sideways at the start and consequently away slowly, raced off the pace near the inside and failed to
menace. BAJAN BULLET chased from inside runners two wide, faded. MR. MARSHALL was very unruly in the gate, chased briefly dropping back three to
four wide on the turn with the saddle apparently slipping a bit, faded.

QUITE READY had a good position outside in the two path tracking the front two, angled four deep outside at the half, rallied three wide at the five
sixteenths marker to bid in the three path straightening out for the drive and wore down fellow rival down the stretch to win the nod at the wire.
RICHIESINTHEHOUSE travelled in a good spot on the rail watching the front duo engage in the beginning, shifted outside between foes in the three path at
the half, crept closer to the front with three furlongs to go, was asked between horses at the quarter, battled at the top of the lane for the lead and gave way
late losing a tight photo in a gutsy performance through the stretch. HALLIE'S HERO was slow finding his feet to be near the rear down the backside, took
closer order at the half, steadied briefly running three wide at the three furlong marker, regrouped quickly to circle four wide making a bold move at the
quarter pole, posed a threat at the top of the stretch in the four path but could not reel in the front pair mildly gaining in deep stretch. BIG EXECUTIVE was
off poorly trailing down the back straight, could see the bunched up field on the rail three furlongs from the prize, shifted outside off the tiring early leader
with five sixteenths to run, swung out to the five path for the drive and evened out through the lane not switching leads to the finish. HICKSY was all alone in
the third flight stalked down the backside, offered a mild run between foes improving at the three eighths pole, was hard ridden to keep up with rivals at the
quarter pole but to no avail and tired in upper stretch. MR CROWLEY had a slim lead outside in the beginning, hounded the pacesetter outside with a half
remaining, was clinging onto the lead on the fence through the turn, was collared outside at the quarter marker and yielded in the final furlong. MAD DOG N
JOE pressed on the fence early on, had a slim advantage inside at the half, could not maintain inside position with others quickening with three furlongs to
go and backed through the field midpoint on the turn and could not be a factor in the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
GRAND ALLIANCE was allowed to settle trailing outside down the backstretch, swung out with momentum seeing the field five wide at the top of the stretch
and was full of run late closing quickly to draw away for the victory in the final seventy yards. ALLEN DIGGS tracked the loose speed horse down the
backstretch, began to reel in the frontrunner two furlongs from the line, took over inside the eighth pole leading narrowly but could not find more to hold off
the fast charging winner nearing the wire. SOUPER RUSH stalked near the back of the pack at the half, rallied up the fence saving ground with a quarter
mile to run, continued to sustain the run inside turning for home, burst between rivals at the sixteenth pole and just missed with a late surge for second
money. THE PREDICAMENT travelled in midfield on the rail, crept closer inside at the quarter pole to be in the mix for a share in the two path at the top of
the lane and finished up willingly for a small piece of the prize. ROYAL MAHOGANY took command from the start, set the brisk fractions down the backside
and throughout the turn, began to shorten stride at the top of the lane, was asking for the wire at the eighth pole and stopped on the fence in deep stretch.
ROLLING HILLS settled in midpack just off the rail down the back straight, was urged for more midway on the turn, could not close the gap on the leaders
and weakened in the four path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MAGNIFICENT MARIO was at the back of the field four deep on the outside in the early going, was roused between quickening rivals at the quarter pole,
had clear running room in the four path at the top of the stretch and determinedly finished up outgaming the outside runner in the late stages for the win.
YODDHA stalked near the rear in the two path down the backstretch, was steadied sharply at the seven sixteenths marker, recovered to rally five wide
swooping around horses on the turn to bid for the lead in the five path in upper stretch, could not sustain the run and was outfinished late besting the rest at
the wire. JACK broke with the field but was uninterested early trailing down the backside, caught up to the pack improving on the fence with seven
sixteenths from home, weaved through traffic making progress on the turn, had no room behind runners at the eighth pole, shifted in to rail late and closed
quickly to get up for third. CLIVE CROSS stalked near the back of the pack three wide between foes down the back straight, made a sharp move
progressing at three furlong marker, shifted out off the tiring leader in mid stretch, lost path at the sixteenth pole and willingly never gave in late finishing on
the fringes in the end. MIAH SAID was in the second flight on the rail watching the front pair duel at the half, offered a brief run two wide three furlongs from
the line to be in the mix of things between foes in the four path turning for home and stalled while in tight quarters at the furlong marker. CELENTANO was
in a good spot watching the contesting pair outside horses four deep down the backstretch, rallied to have a narrow advantage outside running through the
turn, opened up mildly straightening out for the drive, was asked for more run holding onto a diminishing lead at the furlong marker, could not find another
gear late and faded between runners in deep stretch. DREAM ON BABY tracked in the second flight two deep between runners down the backside, was
coaxed three wide at the three furlong marker keeping pace with the leaders, shifted out for the drive in the six path but was empty for the stretch run.
MAKES NO CENTS took this field down the backstretch, put away an early rival pressing inside at the half, was nudged keeping pace up front on the fence
through the turn and could not find another gear in the lane and gave way in mid-stretch. ACADIA settled three deep in midfield between rivals, was asked
for more run four wide three furlongs from the finish but made little progress and gave way outside horses at the quarter pole. HEY LUIGI was hustled hard
vying for the lead leaving the chute, urged right handed in the early part of the backstretch trying to get inside position up front, could not get the lead on the
rail while under a drive at the half and retreated through the field on the turn.
