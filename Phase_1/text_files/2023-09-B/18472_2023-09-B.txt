Footnotes
BARBERRY BANDIT away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of STANFORD NORTH in the run down the backstretch, continued to force the
issue in the run down the backside and into the final turn, took control midway through the turn, and drew clear in the lane. MAX BOOSTER stalked the
contested early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, launched his bid two wide from between rivals entering the final turn,
and closed willingly from just off the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. STANFORD NORTH vied for the lead from the inside of BARBERRY
BANDIT entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival
midway through the turn, and faded in the late stages while holding on for a share. SHESBOURBONONICE broke sharply, but was taken in hand and
allowed to settle at the back of the pack entering the backstretch, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, but was unable to mount a serious
late bid. HE'S A SAINT away well and tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, loomed a danger when engaging
the leaders three wide entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

DESIRED OUTCOME settled at the back of the pack while saving ground at the rail in the run to the first turn, began to advanced smartly from along the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside through the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed determinedly from the outside of
CROWN COUNCIL to get up in the final strides. CROWN COUNCIL broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of B C CHU CHU entering the
first turn, forced the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, shook clear of his pace rival midway through
the turn, and just failed to last, while proving clearly second best. ANDALEIGH away well and was allowed to settle off the contested early pace while racing
one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to be up for a share. B
C CHU CHU away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of CROWN COUNCIL in the
run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival midway through the turn, and weakened in the late stages.
STILETTOS ONLY stumbled in the opening strides, before rushing up three wide entering the first turn, and took a stalking trip into the backstretch,
struggled to hold his position in the run to the final turn while dropping back to trail, and had little to offer late.

off the rail entering he final turn, and closed determinedly from between rivals in deep stretch to get up in time. PADDY D'ORO stalked the leader through
the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, overtook the pacesetter while racing two wide into the final turn, and just failed to last. JUST
MAKE BELIEVE away alertly and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position in the run
down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and battled on gamely two out from the rail in the drive in a solid effort. DYNAMITER away well
and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the second turn and in the run down the backside, battled from

LIBERTY hopped slightly at the start, and trailed the field into the backstretch, commenced his bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed
one out from the rail in the lane, steadied briefly in deep stretch before splitting rivals to come up short. TIZ THE PROSPECT away alertly and rushed to a
clear lead from along the rail entering the first turn, raced on an uncontested lead in the run down the backside, rallied along the rail entering the final turn,
and gave way grudgingly late. AN ARMY OF LIGHT broke sharply and stalked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied
four wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong while finished in the middle of the track. MILITARY CROSS away well and was allowed to
settle off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, pulled his way into a tracking trip approaching the final turn, but needed more when
called upon. Following the running of this race the stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run. Following their review, the stewards disqualified
GROOVIN' IS BACK from first and placed this horse third, for drifting in late and taking the path of BAK TO LIBERTY.

DIVAANY tracked the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed
two out from the rail in the drive to get up in time. SHOWMAN tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, collared the
leader while commencing a two wide bid entering he final turn, took command leaving the turn, and just failed to last. DAPPER DON stalked the early pace
while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, launched his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the
rail in the drive to get up for a share, while galloping out in front. STOLO SPIRIT was fractious prior to the start, and settled off the early pace while racing
two wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive. LILSISTERLEE away alertly
and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside, battled from the inside of SHOWMAN
entering the final turn, but weakened late. CAIRO CRUSADER was unprepared at the start, and was still in the hands of the assistant starter when the gates
opened and trailed the field into the first turn, saved ground at the rail while launching his bid from the back of the pack entering the final turn, and finished
three wide in the drive. DEANARROW stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but
weakened over the final furlong. Following the running of this race the stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race. After review it was deemed
that CAIRO CRUSADER did not receive a fair start, and ordered a full refund on this horse.

STAY FANTASTIC away well and was allowed to settle off a hotly contested pace entering the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down
the backside, set sail after the tiring pacesetters entering the final turn, assumed command leaving the turn, and held ROOKIE YEAR safely at bay late to
prove best. ROOKIE YEAR settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, held his position in the run down the
backside, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive to hold the place. BROKE AN BROKEN away
alertly and was allowed to settle off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, bided his time towards the
rear of the field in the run down the backside, launched his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the inside in the
drive to get up for a share. STAR ENTRY settled off the contested early pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied three
wide entering the final turn, and improved his position late while finishing four wide in the drive. SLOOP JOHN B broke sharply and vied for the lead from
along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the
final turn, was quickly overtaken midway through the turn, and had nothing left for the lane. FOREIGN PROTOCOL settled off the early pace while racing
three wide entering the stretch the first time, continued to bide his time well off the leaders in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. WISELY PLAYED was off a step slow and trailed the field through the stretch the first time,
continued from the back of the pack in the run down the backside, rallied three wide into the final turn, but was unable to mount a serious late bid.
BUZZINGA KARMA rushed up to duel for the lead from the outside of SLOOP JOHN B entering the first turn, continued to battle for the lead from the
outside of that rival through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch while well clear of the balance of the field, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, but was quickly engulfed midway through the final turn, and had nothing left for the drive.

ERLICH settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch the first time, raced into a stalking trip entering the stretch the
second time, continued to save ground through the third turn and in the run down the final time, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn,
slipped through along the rail entering the lane to take charge, and inched clear late to prove best. SLEW'S DA BOSS unhurried early while trailing the field
into the backstretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, continued to bide his time at the back of the field through the stretch the second time, rallied
smartly from just off the rail entering the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the inside in the drive to get up for the place. FORT LANGLEY
settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch the first time, moved into a stalking trip entering the second turn,
maintained that position through the third turn and in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and battled gamely three wide in
the drive to garner a share. YOU DON'T OWN ME away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backside the first time, asserted himself
as the leader through the stretch the second time, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn while drifting three wide, and
finished willingly five wide in the drive in a game effort. ARTISTIC JEWLER settled towards the rear of the field entering the backstretch the first time while
racing one out from the rail, moved into a stalking trip in a bunched up field in the run to the third turn, rallied smartly four wide entering the final turn, and
finished willingly three out from the rail in the drive. LAUGH WITH ME broke sharply and tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch the first time
while racing one out from the rail, maintained his tracking trip through the stretch the second time and in the run to the final turn, rallied along the rail
entering the turn, took the lead leaving the turn while drifting off the rail, and was quickly tackled by ERLICH, was unable to match strides with that rival
straightening for home, and was outfinished late. GORKY PARK stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, maintained his
position through the stretch the second time and in the run down the backside, began to struggle to keep up approaching the final turn, and weakened over
the final furlong. MAKEITORBREAKIT dueled for the lead while racing headstrong in the run down the backstretch the first time, eased himself into a
stalking trip through the stretch the second time while saving ground, maintained a tracking trip to the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. DON
WITH THE WIND stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch the first time, began to lose position while settling off the
leaders through the stretch the second time, dropped back to trail in the run down the backstretch the final time and had nothing to offer late while not being
persevered with in the drive.
