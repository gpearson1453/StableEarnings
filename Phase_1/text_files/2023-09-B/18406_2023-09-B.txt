Footnotes
METALLIC MAN raced up along the fence to take the lead shortly from the gate, set a pressured pace to the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and
finished willingly as much best. SHIPSHAPE broke alertly to be on top, was taken in hand to settle off the pace down the backside, made a steady gain from
three wide midway on the turn to garner the place. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER stalked the pace from the fence in the second pair, rallied at the head of the
lane cutting the corner and finished well to be up for the show. FLOWERPECKER pressed the pace to the top of the stretch and weakened through the
lane. IDEA MAN slow early to be the trailer, rallied four wide in the turn to pass weaker rivals in the stretch. GUARD was one-paced and failed to menace.
SACRED SKY tracked the pace in the second pair from two wide and lacked a response when called upon in the turn. SUDDEN SHIFT was never a threat.

Footnotes
LIVI ME DREAMING raced three wide into the first turn angling in at the bend in front of RUN RUN RABBIT, continued to press the pace to the far turn from
two wide, took command into the final bend, opened up turning for home and finished in a determined drive. LEUCADIA stalked the pace from the rail down
the backside and made steady gains down the lane to be second. MARGARET'S LADY broke alertly to take command from the gate, raced five wide down
the lane the first time, dropped to the rail into the turn, set the pace to midway on the final bend and kept on down the lane to hold the show. ISLE OF HOPE
bumped leaving the gate and bobbled as a result, raced up mid-pack into the first turn, checked severely in traffic entering the first turn when impeded by
RUN RUN RABBIT and bumping NATIVITY to his inside, was gathered up to level off, tracked mid-pack down the backside and made a mild late rally to hit
the board in the stretch. RUN RUN RABBIT raced three wide into the first turn, angled in severely when in tight quarters as LIVI ME DREAMING angled into
the first bend, caused ISLE OF HOPE and NATIVITY to bump and check severely on the bend, raced on to stalk the pace down the backstretch and
weakened coming home. BY HEART unhurried in the early going and rallied mildly without impact. VAI GATTINA slow early and passed weakened rivals
late. NATIVITY raced up the lane the first time in the two path, was bumped and caused to check hard into the first turn in a chain reaction, was taken in
hand while getting out in reaction to the interference, eventually dropped back in hand to be near the rear of the field and went evenly the rest of the way.
CLEARLY COPPER reserved to be mid-pack down the backside from four wide, bolted in the final bend to be taken in hand along the outside fence and
eased to the wire. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE ACTIONS ON THE FIRST TURN AND THE RIDER OF NATIVITY FILED AN
OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT THE WINNER CROSSED INTO THE PATH OF SEVERAL
RIVALS BY INTERFERING WITH RUN RUN RABBIT IN THE FIRST TURN.

Footnotes
SIMPLY JACK stalked the pace from the fence to the far turn, angled out turning for home to threaten, worked around the stopping pacesetter in upper
stretch, angled back inside to engage the leader in mid-stretch and finished determinedly up the inside in a well handled ride. ACTION SEEKER pressed the
pace from three wide through the final bend, assumed command at the top of the stretch and was out-finished late in the lane. STEP ON IT slow early to be
at the rear of the field, made steady gains down the backside, circled six wide coming home and closed well to be gaining late. GHOST BIKE tracked three
wide down the backside, mounted a rally midway on the turn to threaten at the head of the lane and finished evenly. BIG STORMY unhurried early to be
near the rear of the field and made a late rally in the stretch. BOLD BALI well placed in mid-pack between rivals and failed to mount a rally. URSO
GRAYDAR went evenly lacking a response when called upon. FIRE BRYAN set a pressured pace through the far turn and weakened late in the lane.
ELECTRIC CHARGE was never a threat. CADE'S GOAL trailed most of the way and passed weaker in the stretch. WOODYTHEBIDSPOTTER pressed the
pace to the far turn and stopped. JAKES CHANNEL raced mid-field for a half mile and came up empty.

Footnotes
OPTIMAL COURAGE raced in tight quarters along the fence in the early going, was taken up in hand to settle near the rear, angled out turning for home
and rallied four wide in the lane without changing leads to still be up in time. EL ROSILLO stalked the pace to the turn, engaged the pacesetter turning for
home, dueled with that one through the lane to take a lead in deep stretch only to be overtaken by the winner in the final strides. FENESTRA broke alertly to
take command from the gate, set the pace on a clear lead to midway on the turn, dueled through the lane on the lead and was out-finished deep in the drive.
TRIKITRAKI tracked the pace through the turn to be prominent turning for home and failed to gain ground in the stretch. ROGER MCQUEEN flashed brief
speed to press early and faded. SILVER MOON ROAD was never a factor.

NIP N TUCK stalked the pace to the far turn, rallied two wide to take control turning for home and finished well in a determined drive. JEOPARDY THEORY
tracked the leaders from three wide, rallied turning for home to engage the leader midway in the stretch and could not get passed. LEAVE IT TO KITTEN
unhurried early to race near the rear of the field for three quarters, circled seven wide at the top of the lane and closed well to be gaining late. TAKE
CHARGE GENT reserved in hand to race in mid-pack down the backstretch, rallied through the turn to mount a bid in upper stretch and flattened out in the
lane. NERVES OF STEEL settled well off the pace to the far turn and made a mild rally in the stretch. DRIVEN ONE went evenly lacking a rally. BOCO
dueled for the lead through the final bend and tired coming home. ICE SHARD was never a factor. STOP THE SPREAD showed brief speed and was
through early.
