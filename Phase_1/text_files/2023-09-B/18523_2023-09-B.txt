Footnotes
QUICK RAE AA stalked the pace while two wide and between foes, was advancing on the turn from the three path, then dueled with RB HASHTAG
momentarily before kicking clear in the early stretch and was ridden out till the end. RB HASHTAG stalked the pace from the inside, then moved up to duel
with FLEET DE SAND throughout the turn, disposed of that foe then dueled with QUICK RAE AA briefly heading into the stretch then gave way in the end.
FLEET DE SAND set the pace while two wide, then was challenged for the lead by RB HASHTAG from the inside on the turn, dueled gamely before giving
way entering the stretch and held the show prize in the end. AA TAKE A CHANCE chased the pace while five wide down the backstretch, made a mild bid
on the turn and was no threat. RB MUNCHIE stalked the pace while three wide under a hard drive then flattened out on the turn and had no final bid. FOUR
HUNDRED PROOF AA chased the pace while six wide then lugged out entering the turn, angled in towards the rail and was no threat. WMA NORTH WIND
was unhurried early and no factor.
