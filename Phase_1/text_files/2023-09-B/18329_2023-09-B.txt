Footnotes
NITRO TIME rushed up the inside to set a pressured pace on the inside, made a bid to shake clear leaving the turn, then held on late to prove best, driving.
LIVE FIRE tracked the early pace and made a bid on the inside to be gaining late but missed. TAP EM was settled early, saved ground on the turn and had
a mild late rally on the inside to best the rest. KHAKI JACK pressed the pace three wide and faded in the drive. STANHOPE steadied shortly after the start,
then had a belated rally. SPIKES SHIRL chased the pace three wide and weakened. NAUTICAL NATURE stalked the pace four to three wide and
weakened. MY BLUE EYES failed to menace. U KANT WHIP IT was off a bit slow and checked after the start, then was not a factor. The rider on
STANHOPE claimed foul against KHAKI JACK for interference leaving the gate, after reviewing the replays the STEWARDS disallowed the objection and
left the race as is.

SPIRITUAL KING was away alertly to set the pace on the inside while being well handled, drew out leaving the turn and then was ridden out to prove much
the best. NICK PAPAGIORGIO was allowed to settle, swung out five wide leaving the turn and rallied, second best. SACHMO chased the pace on the inside
and had no kick while besting the rest. COLBALOAF was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace on the outside and weakened. DYNAMITE KARMA
stalked the early pace three wide, then was between rivals on the turn and tired. PAPAL LAW stalked the winner two wide and then was empty in the drive.

Footnotes
REBEL INVASION pressed the pace three wide and then inherited a big lead when the pace setter went bad leaving the quarter pole, then maintained a
safe margin to the wire to prove best, driving. CIRCLE P chased the pace in between rivals three wide, then finished well late to be clearly second best.
MUSIC BOX DANCER was allowed to settle early, swung out four wide leaving the turn and had no rally, bested rest. INTERRUPTER was off slowly,
advanced two wide on the turn, angled in leaving the three sixteenths and then had a belated rally on the inside. DRAMA KEY passed the tiring rivals.
PENTATONIC chased the pace in between rivals and weakened. SONG OF THE EAST chased the pace on the outside, then angled out extremely wide to
avoid the fallen rider by the quarter pole. HOLD MY BEER BRO chased the pace on the inside and weakened. CHASIN' WHISKEY was reserved early,
then was guided wide to avoid the fallen rider by the quarter pole, no factor. PTERODACTYL set a pressured pace and shook clear by the quarter pole and
then went bad and lost the rider, vanned off.
