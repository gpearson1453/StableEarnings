Footnotes
GALLANT WARREN tracked the decent early pace from the inside, was well positioned through the backstretch run, gained ground along the far turn,
tipped two wide for the drive, overtook ROISTER inside of the furlong pole, was kept to task into the final sixteenth, felt pressure from oncoming rivals into
deep stretch, was all out in the final yards and lasted for the win at the finish. TEX HANLEY broke a step slowly, was caught in early traffic and settled
outside of runners into the first turn, improved position along the far turn while four wide, was roused three wide into the stretch, chased to the furlong
grounds, responded to steady urging and rallied in deep stretch, pressured the winner to the finish but could not get by GALLANT WARREN and just missed
for the win, while just holding for second. BROKEN FINGER was allowed to settle, raced inside of a rival while toward the back through the backstretch run,
was steered to the three path along the far turn and came four wide into the stretch, finished well while racing widest into the final sixteenth and just missed
for the win and place, while holding safely for the show. ROISTER was hustled leaving the start, assumed command and cleared the field into the first turn,
dictated terms through the backstretch run, set a decent pace into the far turn and held a clear lead at the quarter marker, had the margin cut into in upper
stretch, was overtaken by his stablemate inside of the furlong marker, chased GALLANT WARREN to deep stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth.
GORDY'S BOY tracked the decent early pace while three wide, continued to track while outside of rivals through the backstretch run, chased three wide to
the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and lacked a late rally. MY SUNSHINE was asked for early speed and was forwardly placed into the first
turn, stalked the decent pace from a two wide path through the backstretch run, lost position on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SATANTA was unhurried in the early running, advanced while saving ground on the turn, was steered to the two path into upper stretch and was roused at
the top of the lane, closed fast in mid-stretch and came within aim of YES HE CAN nearing the sixteenth-marker, caught the runner-up into deep stretch and
inched away in the final stages. YES HE CAN was sent to establish the early lead, showed good speed while pressed into the turn, set quick fractions while
pressed to the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and drew to a clear lead inside of the furlong marker, was overtaken by the winner in deep stretch
and bested the rest. REFI NOW tracked the quick early pace from the second flight, raced two wide along the turn and gained ground nearing the quarter
marker, lost ground into the stretch, lacked the needed response in the final stages and was outkicked, while holding clearly in the end for third. R M C
HOOK'EM tracked the quick early pace from the second flight, saved ground into the turn and improved position heading to the quarter marker, could not
keep pace into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. QUANTUM QUEST broke alertly, was asked to rate in the early stages but was a bit keen and
pulled on the rider to press the solid early pace, pressed from the three path into the turn, kept pressure on the quick pace along the bend, lost position into
the stretch, chased to the furlong marker and tired in the final stages.

SUGAR BEETS was unhurried in the early going, saved ground along the first turn then shifted to the two path into the backstretch, maintained that two
wide path into the far turn, came three wide into the drive and loomed nearing mid-stretch, shifted out a path at the furlong marker and bumped
HOWDOYALIKEMENOW, continued his long drive into the final sixteenth, vied for the lead with SPEED GRAZY in deep stretch, took command in the final
yards and held in a drive at the finish to prevail. SPEED GRAZY settled off of the contentious early pace and saved ground into the first turn, saved ground
while well placed through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground to the far turn, mounted an inside bid into upper stretch and took command nearing
the furlong marker, was kept to task while under steady urging into deep stretch, was overtaken by SUGAR BEETS in the final strides and was outfinished
for the win, while just holding for second at the finish. CANELITO was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the decent early pace while outside of rivals
and was well placed through the backstretch run, raced three wide into the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved out a path at the furlong grounds,
rallied while widest in the late stages and just missed for second, while holding safely in the end for third. CHIEF WILD EAGLE raced close to the early pace
leaving the break, took back along the first turn and tracked while four wide into the backstretch run, made a three wide middle move approaching the
half-mile pole and attended to the decent pace into the far turn, vied for the lead while three wide nearing the quarter marker and battled into the stretch,
fought for the lead with SPEED GRAZY at the furlong marker, continued into deep stretch, could not match strides with oncoming rivals in the final stages
and tired late. HOWDOYALIKEMENOW was prominent in the early running, took back into the first turn and tracked the decent pace into the backstretch
run, maintained a two wide path to the second turn, swung three wide for the drive and gained ground nearing mid-stretch, was bumped at the furlong
marker by SUGAR BEETS and shifted to the four path at that station, could not keep pace with the leaders into deep stretch and weakened in the final
stages. JOHNNY DAR was hard sent leaving the start, vied for the lead into the first turn then assumed command and showed the way into the backstretch
run, set decent fractions while controlling the pace to the half-mile marker, showed the way into the far turn while off of the rail, came under pressure at the
quarter marker, held foes at bay into upper stretch, battled for the lead to the furlong grounds and faded in deep stretch. THE RIDER OF
HOWDOYALIKEMENOW LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF SUGAR BEETS FOR THE INCIDENT OCCURRING IN MID-STRETCH. IN
A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

took a narrow lead at the quarter marker, battled between rivals into upper stretch, held a narrow lead at the furlong grounds, shook free into deep stretch,
felt late pressure from oncoming rivals and determinedly kept to task in the final strides. GRACEFUL MISCHIEF was crowded at the start by an inner rival
and was away a bit slowly, settled off of the modest early pace and raced two wide along the first turn, maintained that two wide path to the far turn while
never far back, chased between rivals to the quarter marker, angled four wide for the stretch drive, gained ground at the furlong pole, closed in deep stretch,
could not reel in the winner in the final stages and held well for second at the finish. MOONRISE DRIVE was bumped at the start by OUR NORTH STAR

coaxed along to the outside and came five wide into the stretch, finished well inside of the furlong marker and just missed for second while getting up in time
for third. THE SLAP was prominent leaving the start, rated into the first turn and tracked the pace from a three wide path into the backstretch run, was well
positioned while outside of rivals heading to the half-mile marker, mounted a four wide bid along the far turn, vied for the lead into upper stretch, battled with
CENTRE CIRCLE to the furlong grounds, could not sustain his run into the final sixteenth and flattened out late. TRIBUTE TO M paused at the start and
was off very slowly, chased the field into the first turn, improved position at the half-mile marker and raced three wide into the far turn, swung six wide into
the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, was able to offer a mild late bid but needed more in deep stretch. BOBBED N LURED broke alertly and
assumed command in the opening stages, set modest fractions while prompted into the backstretch run, carved out the pace while pressured to the
half-mile marker, lost the lead to CENTRE CIRCLE along the far turn, fought back into upper stretch, could not match strides with the leaders into the final
sixteenth and tired. OUR NORTH STAR broke out at the start and bumped with MOONRISE DRIVE, stalked the modest pace from the inside, saved all of
the ground to the far turn, lost position into the stretch and gave way. BANOG BOY crowded GRACEFUL MISCHIEF at the start, pulled on the rider in the

Footnotes
VANTAGE POINT hustled to the front, gained the rail and took short lead going into the clubhouse turn, slowed the pace down for the backstretch run,
responded when asked to quicken away past the seven sixteenths pole, extended the lead, came into the stretch with plenty in reserve and outsprinted the
field to the wire. ECOLOGIST broke slowly, spotted the field a head start, remained in the clear four wide, gradually regained contact with the field, swung
into the stretch while still four wide and produced a strong rally to gain the place. MOOGIE SON raced close up while in the three path in the early going,
went after the pacesetter approaching the three furlong marker, ran on well down the stretch under intermittent urging but could not reel in the eventual
winner and was passed late for second. BUENISIMO was allowed to settle mid-pack while pulling on the rider through the first turn, settled into a tracking
spot down the backstretch, came under a ride from the five-sixteenths pole but could not muster a rally and finished one-paced. CUT ACROSS SHORTY
was not asked for speed from the gate, took the rail path to the far turn, tried to mount a rally with three furlongs to run but could not make an impact.
TRINIDAD broke well and was pushed to gain forward position took a stalking position behind the leader and maintained that position to the far turn while
under some restraint, was unable to keep pace when VANTAGE POINT quickened away, came under heavy pressure near the quarter pole then tired down
the stretch.

Footnotes
ENOS SLAUGHTER tracked from mid-pack through the early stages, always traveling well in the clear to the outside, improved position from the half mile
pole, was roused in earnest passing the quarter pole, had a clear run into the stretch, made a determined run, wore down QUE SERA SIR RALPH inside
the final sixteenth then held off a fast closing rival at the wire. RESPECT THE HUSTLE tracked the early pace while keeping to the inside, attempted to
launch a bid in the far turn but was stuck behind horses until the field turned for home, found a seam in deep stretch and surged to gain the place. QUE
SERA SIR RALPH broke well then easily established a clear lead setting comfortable fractions in hand, took on a challenge from GROWTH ENGINE
passing the three furlong marker, bested that one by mid-stretch, ran on gamely but could not hold off the top pair in the late stages. SEA OF LIBERTY
tracked three deep to the half mile marker, launched a three wide bid on the far turn, drifted out a bit turning for home then ran on well despite drifting in and
out a bit and just missed a minor award. HOUSE OF LORDS lagged near the back of the field, saved ground through the far turn, swung five wide into the
stretch and made a good late run but could not make up the needed ground. RIJEKA (IRE) raced near the back of the field two deep to the far turn, began a
mild rally with three furlongs to run, swung three wide for the stretch run, briefly encountered some traffic then found some room to run on the inside and ran
on well in the final furlong. GROWTH ENGINE broke well and pressed QUE SERA SIR RALPH in the early stages, backed out near the seven-eighths
marker and settled in to a stalking position two back, moved to challenge for the lead passing the three furlong pole, was rebuffed then tired in the stretch.
NO SLO MO devoid of any early speed, chased the field throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
SIR GREYSON was asked for speed away from the gate, took back in the opening furlong and tracked the fast pace into the turn, gave chase while two
wide approaching the quarter pole, overtook GOLDENSUNRISE in upper stretch and took command heading to the furlong marker, drew clear while kept to
steady urging into deep stretch and powered home late as much the best. I'M DR. O settled off of the fast early pace, tracked the quick fractions while three
wide into the turn and improved position at the quarter marker, loomed into upper stretch, raced on the left lead into the final sixteenth, was no match for the
winner in the late stages and was second best. HYDRO FROST rated off of the fast early pace and saved ground into the turn, checked while in tight
quarters at the three-furlong marker, chased from the rail to the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch and advanced at the furlong marker, was
not able to impact the top two in the final stages and held clearly at the end for third. GOLDENSUNRISE broke alertly and was hard sent in the early
running, set a fast early pace and drew to a clear lead heading into the turn, carved out quick fractions from the rail heading to the quarter pole, was collared
by SIR GREYSON in upper stretch, chased that rival to the sixteenth-marker and faded in deep stretch. WESTERN CAPE was away in good order, lacked
early speed and chased the fast pace from the rear, was guided outside of rivals and came three wide to the quarter marker, swung six wide for the stretch
drive, and did not threaten. MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE was squeezed at the start and was away a bit slowly, tracked the fast early pace while two wide and
between runners, maintained that two wide path while between rivals into upper stretch, could not keep pace into the drive and did not factor in the final
furlong. DINOS DIXIE tracked the fast early pace from the inside, lost position heading to the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the stretch drive, ran
evenly to the furlong grounds and tired in the final stages.
