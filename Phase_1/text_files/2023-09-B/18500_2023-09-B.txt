RUDY ROD broke poorly and raced far back, advanced strongly inside and pulled away through the final furlong. CAPTAIN CHAZZ set a pressured pace in
the two path, shook loose briefly on the turn then weakened in the stretch. THERISASTORMBREWIN forced the pace along the inside early and continued
willingly. MANOLETE settled off the pace inside, angled out on the turn then flattened lout in the lane. MANAHAWKIN dropped far behind and narrowed the
gap without menacing. JUST A THOUGHT prompted the leaders three wide then began fading on the turn.

Footnotes
HEFFNER settled wide off the pace, crept closer after half a mile, rallied and caught the leaders passing the eighth pole and edged off. PLAMEN just off the
pace outside, vied from the final turn to the wire but was outfinished. SOPHOS dropped far behind and offered late energy through the final quarter mile.
SHANE'S JEWEL dueled outside then inside on the final turn then weakened slightly in the stretch. LONG GRAY LINE trailed for half a mile racing wide and
was never a factor. EMPEROR'S CAUSE rated off the pace near the inside and gradually faltered. CRAFTY DON led narrowly along the rail for half a mile
and gave way. DARK STORM dropped back early then gave way readily losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
YES SIR COLONEL well placed outside, bid on the final turn, hooked the leader near the eighth pole and edged off driving. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK hustled
to a clear lead inside, shook loose on the final turn then weakened slightly. SCOOP DAWG lacked speed then closed the gap wide to gain the show. SAINT
MARCO settled four wide off the leaders and continued willingly in the stretch. CORKMAN chased off the leaders between foes and lacked a solid rally.
SEMPER FI raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and faltered in the stretch. SECRET PATH lagged far behind near the inside and was always outrun.
CELTIC TREASURE reserved just off the pace near the inside, stopped after half a mile.

narrow advantage dueling in the two path, bid clear but was nailed. R TENDERONI broke slowest, rallied inside then closed strongly too late. SCOTT ALAIA
urged close up five wide, faded briefly on the turn then came again. BOCA ROYALTY dueled outside to the late stages and weakened slightly. WHAT A
BEAUT close up from the outset, angled out in the stretch but faltered. ISABELLA SMILE dropped back early and was never in contention.
TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE forced the pace in the opening quarter then began fading on the turn. J J LOVES BILLY dropped well behind and was never a
factor. CARLY HUSTLE raced in midpack early then gave way readily. YOURINDENIAL lacked speed and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BLAZING RED dueled throughout outside with trio then solo opponent then stuck his head in front in the final yards in a determined debut. RESPIRATOR
vied between rivals, held a narrow lead in midstretch and battled to the wire just missing. SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE earned a slight lead inside, dueled
through the turn and weakened. COLD SHOT prompted the pace four wide to the stretch and tired and returned with a cut mouth. WHOOSH lagged far
behind then offered some late energy. SEPARATE WAYS rated behind wall of dueling pacesetters, then flattened out in the lane. NICKY DA FOX dropped
far behind chasing wide and was never involved. E T'S DEMON FIRE broke slowest and raced far behind throughout. VIRAL VIDEO lacked speed and gave
way readily.

PEOPLE FORCE stalked the pacesetter outside, edged to the front at the eighth pole and battled gamely to the wire. LAYTOWN ducked out at the start,
rushed to the lead inside, was collared in the lane and held gamely to the finish. BIG BEEMSTER moved closer inside before half a mile then went evenly
stretch. CATCH THE SMOKE settled four wide off the pace and lacked a solid rally. BRETT'S WORLD lacked speed outside and was never a factor.
LOOSE GOOSE dropped back early, angled out on the final turn then faltered. CLASSIC UNION moved close up early in the two path and gave way.
