Footnotes
ALHAAN allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain, angled out late and
edged up in the final strides. CASTLE BORN well placed and off the rail, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch,
made a steady gain, shook clear inside the furlong marker and was outfinished. ORPHAN EXCHANGE unhurried, looped up three and four wide through
the turn, came widest into the stretch and closed for the show. AFTER NOON KISSES stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path
through the turn, bid outside the leader, drifting out into the stretch and weakened. IMFREEFALLIN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held
command without challenge to the furlong marker, then faded. IT'S A FOX well placed and inside, lost some ground through the turn, then faded into the
stretch. BABY BLUE was never involved.

SUMMERFEST allowed to settle, moved up and came through on the two path into the stretch, was blocked, found room four wide, split foes, made a
steady gain and edged up in the final strides. STRAIGHTOUTADUTTON sprinted to a clear lead pulling, drew off through the turn, held command to the
final yards and was outfinished. HAIG POINT unhurried, moved up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, then drifted in badly
under left hand urging and missed the place. MILITARY DRILL allowed to settle, circled the field through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, made a
steady gain and edged up for a share. JUST WATCH ME NOW mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch and flattened the final furlong. SAMURAI LEGACY tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, drifted out into the stretch three wide, holding
position, then faded the final furlong. WAPITI WAY well placed, steadily lost ground. CHEROKEE CHATTER steadied in the early going, angled out for clear
racing room, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, then faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
CITY TRIPPER traced the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain,
edged ahead at the furlong marker, then drove clear late. RUNAWAY STAR broke in at the start, bumping INNUENDO repeatedly, moved up quickly inside
through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, collared the leader at the furlong marker, then lacked the needed late kick. HINDENBURG
sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held command into the stretch, then was collared at the furlong marker and weakened. LEGIO unhurried, saved
ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, then closed willingly and gained a share. T C GREELEY well placed and off the rail, held
position two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and flattened out. TURNS ran evenly. CROWLEY'S WAR well placed and
outside, held position three and four wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch. INNUENDO bumped repeatedly at the start and pushed in, was no
factor.

Footnotes
FORTUNE SELLER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task.
EXPRESS STAR allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then angled out inside the furlong marker
for clear racing room and edged up for the place in the final strides. ABRAMS tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside
the leader into the stretch, then could not gain the final furlong and was outfinished for the place. BAYTOWN BRUISER well placed and between, held
position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. TAP THE SKY unhurried, saved ground through the turns, came
through inside into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. SO CLOSE SO FAR mid pack and outside, lost some position three and four wide through the
second turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and weakened. LOU THE BODY improved position, outside. STRAWBERRY KWIK well placed and
outside, lost position on the two path through the second turn, angled in and came through inside and had no rally. STREET OUTLAW was a brief factor,
inside. RORY'S ORCHARD was never involved.

SHORTY MAC set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the turn, then lasted under steady pressure. LA REINA DEL NORTE tracked the pace, moved up
inside through the turn, angled out to bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain and missed. WARRIOR'S MISS allowed to
settle, saved ground through the turn on the two path, came through on that path into the stretch, came again late and edged for the show. STRAIGHT
MADNESS allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and was outfinished for the
show. RAINAS ROLLIN unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, gained position at the furlong marker and flattened.
PHANCY PHILLY mid pack outside, lost some ground four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and faded. I'M HEADING EAST well placed
and outside, lost some ground three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no rally. SAILOR'S SALUTE stalked the pace

Footnotes
YARDMAN set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off under steady pressure. THREE O ONE tracked the
pace, held position on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out, made a steady gain and closed well for
the place. SHAKEN AND SHIMMY unhurried, looped to position four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch, flattened and gained the
show. GIANTSBANE well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid four wide outside the leader into the stretch, then
faded the final furlong. MR. YASUDA passed a tiring rival. ROUND ROBIN stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to vie into the second turn, then faded
through the turn.
