Footnotes
YONO good position to far turn, went inside throughout stretch run and cleared off in the final stages to the wire. FAST FALL pressed pace to the half,
cleared in stretch but run down in the final sixteenth but bested the rest to the wire. GOLDEN REIGN inside speed to the half but could not keep up and
settled for show spot. DIAL HIM UP outside run throughout while never a real threat. P K WOOD had striking position to the half but gave in readily from that
pole. DRAFT CAPITAL had an awkward start, breaking in a tangle and always trailed throughout. Race 8 the finish time was hand timed when the beam at
the wire was interfered with, all other internal fractions were correct.
