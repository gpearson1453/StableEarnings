Footnotes
FOREVER FRIENDS reserved off the pace to the turn, circled four wide to commence his rally, engaged the pacesetter in deep stretch and pulled clear at
the wire in a drive. CHA CHA LARRY sped up to set an early pressured pace, cleared into the turn, maintained his advantage to midway down the lane and
was out-finished inside the final sixteenth while clearly second best. FOREVER LASTING tracked the leader from the rail to be prominent turning for home
and finished evenly. BIG CITY HEAT stalked the pace from two wide into the turn, rallied to the head of the lane and weakened down the stretch.
YOSHIDA'S IMPACT raced wide down the backstretch and into the turn and failed to mount a closing rally. WE MISS OTIS went one-paced failing to
menace. TURBONATOR was never a threat. PRADO CITY was not a factor.

Footnotes
MAS ORO prompted the pace to midway on the bend, responded when called upon nearing the quarter pole, engaged the pacesetter in upper stretch and
drew off down the lane. PHILIP SNOW set the pace on a comfortable lead, dug-in turning for home, finished willingly but could not hold off the winner.
PAIGE PERFECT tracked the leaders into the turn, was called upon early to rally in the turn, could not gain on the leaders but finished the best of the rest.
GRAY MIKE unhurried early on and made a steady mild rally to hit the board. MOTION TO ADJOURN raced mid-pack on the outside down the backside,
dropped to the rear of the pack in the turn and passed weakening rivals down the lane. ZEN JOURNEY trailed most of the way and never threatened. JACK
D was well placed chasing the pace to the turn and came up empty. SNERDLEY broke a step slow, rushed up along the fence to midway on the turn,
stopped coming home and was vanned off after passing the wire. He was later discovered to have bled.

CLASSIC KITTEN stalked the pace from three wide down the backside, took command into the far turn, opened a clear advantage and was kept to task
down the lane as much best. SOLRUN set the pace down the backside, responded when called upon in the turn and held well down the lane while no match
for the winner. UNBRIDLED MISS prompted pace for the first half mile and finished evenly. WHO'S SORRY NOW raced wide into the first turn, was taken in
hand to save ground dropping to the fence, was held up off heels from the rail down the backside and came up empty when called upon. LOTTA LATTE
was never a threat.

HIGHLANDS unhurried early to settle at the rear of the field, steadily gained ground down the backside, angled out in the turn while circling the leaders,
engaged the pacesetters in upper stretch and drew clear as much the best being geared down nearing the wire. ENTICING SUNSET tracked the leaders
from three wide down the backside, bid into the turn from four wide, angled to the inside in upper stretch and finished willingly up the inside to gain the
place. BAYTOWN KITTY CAT settled near the back into the first turn, steadily gained ground up the rail down the backstretch, angled out turning for home
to rally three wide, waited behind stopping rivals down the lane and closed well late. OLD FASHIONED GIRL stalked the pace through the far turn to be
prominent at the head of the lane and weakened in the drive. KAM'S ROCKIN GOLD sped up from the outside draw to open a clear lead into the first turn,
maintained the advantage to late in the final bend and tired down the lane. FREE FUJI was through early and never a factor.

RACCOON RODEO was brushed at the start, bid four wide at the three-eighths pole, vied three wide briefly in the stretch, drew off at the eighth pole and
won under mild urging. MOPED MO was off awkwardly, dueled outside of a rival, went clear at the quarter pole, but couldn't last while dueling for the place.
QUARRYMEN bore in at the start, raced inside, bid between foes at the quarter pole, dueled for the place through the stretch and settled for third. SPOKEN
CODE was impeded at the start, trailed, then found his best stride late outside. OX TAP was unrushed, bid in the five path at the quarter pole, then faltered
the stretch. RUSTY stalked the early pace in the four path, then faded in the stretch. BEYOND STOKED was brushed at the start, dueled inside, then gave
way in the stretch.

Footnotes
LAWMAKER tracked the leaders from two wide down the backside, rallied three wide turning for home, engaged the pacesetter in deep stretch to take
command and just held late. BROKEN JUSTICE unhurried for the first half mile, rallied five wide in the turn and finished well to be gaining late and just
come up short. BREAKOUT STAR slow early to trail while saving ground through the far turn along the rail, angled to the seven path at the head of the lane
and closed well belatedly. CHAMBERS BAY sped to the lead into the first turn, opened a clear lead down the backside, responded when called upon turning
for home to maintain the advantage and weakened late in the drive. BAYOU CHROME reserved for the run down the backside along the rail in striking
distance and failed to respond when called upon. DON'T CROSS JACK stalked the pace down the backstretch, made a bid in the turn to loom up turning for
home and flattened out down the lane. ALMIGHTYJUSTICE never threatened at any time. BRODY'S FLY was one-paced and never a factor. OUT OF
ALCATRAZ prompted the pace to the far turn and gave way coming home.

Footnotes
WILD TAPIT unhurried in the early going, moved three wide in the turn to sweep to the lead in upper stretch, drew clear midway in the lane and was geared
down nearing the wire as much best. BEG BORROW N STEAL broke a step slow to be at the back, continued to be the trailer through the turn, angled wide
coming home and closed well to gain the place. LEXI SUN stalked the pacesetter into the turn, made a threatening bid turning for home and finished evenly
being out-kicked by the closers. MAGIC BEAUTY broke alertly to speed off to a clear lead through rapid fractions and tired midway down the lane. LIL EVIE
rated in mid-pack saving ground and failed to gain ground making no impact. FOR THE BISCUIT chased the leaders from four wide to the far turn and
flattened out. MONTGOMERY PARK failed to menace. DESTINY'S DARLING never seriously threatened. MOON OVER TUSCANY prompted the pace
early and gave way.

Footnotes
AKAMAI broke alertly to be the pacesetter, was well rated while under pressure the entire trip, shook free of the presser in upper stretch and repelled all
challenges in the lane in a very game effort. MUTAKATIF (IRE) stalked the pace to the top of the lane, rallied well in the stretch only to be denied at the wire
in a good effort. EL RAYO unhurried early through the first turn, made a steady advance from four wide down the backside and was gaining five wide in
deep stretch. ONE LUCKY DAY pressed the pace the entire way to be prominent deep in the drive and weakened in the final going. NAVY SOUL tracked
the leaders down the backside, lost position through the final bend and came again down the lane to be going well late. PERUVIAN LUCKY settled in hand
for the first run down the lane, saved ground along the rail to upper stretch and angled out finding his best stride late. STORM DADDY raced three wide
losing ground in the first turn, rallied into the final bend to prominently placed in upper stretch and flattened out late in the drive. ASSIDUOUSLY (GB) was
never a threat. GET THROUGH slow early to trail the field, made a mild rally into the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
DATTTS LIFE tracked the pace down the backside while in hand, rallied four wide in the turn to challenge for the lead, dueled with the runner-up through the
lane and pulled clear late. COWBOY JUSTICE stalked the pace to the far turn, ranged up three wide dueling with the winner for the lead, could not go with
that one deep in the drive but finished willingly to be clearly second best. UNBRIDLED SLOPE slow early to trail and made a steady gain coming home to
be the best of the rest. EL TULIPAN well placed while rated in mid-pack and failed to gain ground. REFLEX chased the pace for a half mile and weakened.
TREMOR set the pace for a half mile and tired. BOOMING failed to menace. HOLIDAY CITY was never a threat. PROPHET OBADIAH was not a factor.
LOOMING showed brief speed while racing wide and came up empty.
