Footnotes
CHAIRMAN LAYLA was nudged on early to get inside position leading into the first turn, dictated terms down the backside, was well rated getting a breather
bunching up the field at the three furlong marker, spurted clear when roused in upper stretch and held safe comfortably crossing the line. TWIXTER
travelled in midfield two wide on the first turn, stalked near the rear outside foes down the backstretch, advanced between rivals when scrubbed on splitting
foes three wide at the quarter marker and chased the winner down the stretch besting the rest at the wire. SPANISH SERENADE was unhurried trailing in
the early stages, began to pick up runners four wide around horses at the quarter pole and finished with intent outside foes through the stretch to be a clear
third in the end. KINZHAL settled on the rail in midpack in the early going, rated kindly nestled on the fence down the backside, had clear run inside with five
sixteenths to go and made little impact on the fence down the lane for a minor share. MANETKA pressed between foes on the first turn, hounded the
pacesetting winner down the backside, was urged midpoint on the far turn chasing the leader but to no avail and faltered between rivals in the three path at
the furlong pole. LITTLE DOMI prompted the pace three wide into the first turn, continued to keep a close eye on the frontrunning winner three deep down
the backstretch, came under a ride trying to match strides with the leaders midway on the final turn, made no headway and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SMART COVERAGE chased the pacesetter two deep at the half, battled for the front outside on the turn, cleared off for the lead at the quarter pole and held
on at the finish by a diminishing margin when crossing the wire. JMR SPEEDY ESCAPE tracked the contesting pair on the rail at the half, waited inside on
the turn, was roused on the rail turning for home and rallied up the fence late to better two rivals for place at the finish. VERY DEBONAIRE took command in
the beginning, dueled for the lead running inside through the turn, could not keep pace with the winner quickening at the quarter pole and stubbornly gave
way in deep stretch between horses to lose the runners up share in the end. SEA TO AIR rated in midpack outside foes down the backstretch, rallied two
wide outside runners three furlongs from the wire, was in range three wide straightening out for the drive and ran on determinedly outside down the stretch
but was on the wrong end of the three way finish for place at the wire. SILENT RISK stalked on the rail near the rear, could see the field saving ground
running on the turn and showed some interest passing weary foes down the lane. MIDNIGHT MOONSHINE travelled in the middle of the field on the rail
down the backside, was roused through the turn but could not get involved and had little to show driving to the finish line. BEE BEE THE KING had a slow
start trailing in the beginning inside, put in a mild run two wide outside foes from the three eighths marker to the quarter pole and emptied out turning for
home.

Footnotes
UPHILL DANCE settled alone in midpack under a tight rein down the backside, cruised around foes midway on the turn, was urged three wide at the quarter
pole, quickly pouncing on horses to take command at the furlong marker and drew away convincingly in deep stretch. TWO GHOSTS bobbled slightly on
the break, regrouped to track the frontrunner three deep down the backstretch, was ridden for more going after the leader at the quarter pole to be in the
hunt three wide between rivals for the drive, was no match for the closing winner at the furlong marker and stubbornly held off the stablemate for the runners
up share at the wire. PONTIAC was void of speed trailing in the early going inside, improved on the rail at the half under a hold, was checked mildly in tight
quarters shuffled back some with three eighths remaining and found his best stride late closing in to just miss getting up for place at the finish. CRAFTY
OAKS tracked the frontrunner in the two path in the beginning, was hard ridden on the rail midpoint on the turn keeping pace with the leaders, had a chance
for a share on the fence at the top of the lane and finished up one paced to the wire for a minor role in the end. NATURAL STAR stalked three deep near
the rear down the back straight, could not keep up with others running through the turn and showed some interest late catching up to pass the early
pacesetter that was tiring at the finish. CLASSY IMAGE cleared from the outside post to set the pace on the rail down the backside, comfortably dictated
terms through the turn, was collared outside turning for home, offered little resistance in upper stretch and faltered with a sixteenth from the finish.

Footnotes
SUMMER SNOW was coaxed to the lead soon after the start, moved clear after the opening furlong, set the pace in the two path, widened leaving the turn
into upper stretch, held safe and was eased up late. ROOKIE COURT tracked from inside, came out a bit at the top of the stretch, was no match for the
winner but held the place. GOLDEN TRAIN was urged at the break, chased from inside, went evenly late. TELLTALE stalked from outside going three wide
on the turn, needed more. WAR'S END KISS was lightly bumped up the backstretch, shifted in racing at the back just off the rail through the turn, failed to
rally. SO BREANNA broke a step slowly, moved forward inside foes looking for room up the backstretch and bumped an outside foe, moved out from four to
six wide leaving the turn, was never near enough to threaten. BITTERSWEETBIZNESS raced outside at the rear going three to four wide on the turn, was
not a factor.

Footnotes
MENTORING hopped at the break, pressed on the rail in the beginning, had a narrow lead inside at the half mile marker, opened up while in hand running
on the turn to have a comfortable lead straightening out for the drive and was kept to the task late for an impressive win. PREETZAH'S STAR travelled three
deep in midfield down the backside, circled four wide making a sharp move outside rivals through the turn, chased the winner but to no avail down the
stretch and held for second in a solid effort besting the rest. WONT FORGET YOU stalked near the rear down the backstretch, was on hold trailing on the
fence behind a runner with three furlongs to go, was steadied a couple of times losing momentum on the rail through the turn, rallied between horses in the
two path at the quarter pole and was full of run late closing with each stride down the lane to be a hard luck third at the finish. HARPER CITY trailed in the
early going, began to extend ones stride three wide commencing at the three eighths pole going around horses, was in the mix for a piece of the prize four
wide turning for home but levelled out at the furlong marker to be on the fringes at the end. NO MORE SALT had a good spot watching the engaging pair at
the half, could not maintain forward position when roused three furlongs from home and faded with a quarter mile left to run. BROTHER BELEN had a slim
advantage outside leaving the chute, was relegated to a chasing role at the half, could not keep up to the winner who was opening up on rivals with three
furlongs from the finish and backed through the field on the rail at the quarter pole. SING DIXIE broke in at the start, travelled in the middle of the pack with
runners on either side down the backstretch, could not reach contention running two wide throughout the turn and was never a presence driving to the wire.
COMMANDER AT SEA settled in mid-pack on the rail down the back straight, was coaxed for more on the fence through the turn, offered little response and
backed away with two furlongs to run and had nothing to give in the stretch run.

Footnotes
DESOLATOR settled mid-pack three to four wide, swept to the lead outside foes at the five-sixteenths, kicked clear heading into upper stretch and held
safe. LION KINGDOM settled at the back racing off the rail, came out in upper stretch, rallied between runners to secure the place. LAPOCHKA dwelt at the
start, raced outside about three to four wide at the rear, began to advance on the far turn still forced wide racing four to five deep, swung seven wide into
upper stretch gaining some but evened out the final furlong. SAILOR'S PASSION exchanged a light bump at the start, raced between runners off the pace
two to three wide early, advanced into the far turn moving out from three to four wide on that bend, lacked the needed late kick. SOLAR settled outside
racing mostly four to five wide, failed to rally. SUNRISE DRIVE shifted in saving ground inside mid-pack, failed to menace. MAD DOG N JOE was quick to
the lead, set the pace two wide facing constant pressure from an inside rival, was overtaken midway on the far turn, weakened. MALIBU UPROAR
exchanged a light bump at the start, stalked the leading pair racing off the fence, was in range coming to the mid-point of the far turn, weakened. TARADAR
hounded the pacesetter from inside, tired. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START IT WAS DETERMINED ALL RUNNERS RECEIVED A
FAIR START.

Footnotes
DREAMS AND SCHEMES settled in the middle of the field two wide in the beginning stages, improved smartly on the fence down the backstretch, began to
reel in the loose pacesetter with three eighths to go, collared the early leader outside under a vigorous hand ride in upper stretch and held safe when roused
for more in the final furlong. I'M SNOW ANGEL broke out at the start, was allowed to settle co-trailing inside on the first turn, could see the field three deep
outside rivals down the backside, made a sharp move swooping around horses three furlongs to the wire, posed the only threat to the winner at the top of
the lane and stubbornly chased in deep stretch but could not get there in the end. BRIEF co-trailed stalking three wide in the first turn, settled on the rail
near the rear down the backside, had to be throttled down, on hold, stuck behind a tiring rival with five sixteenths from home, shifted outside splitting foes
two wide at the quarter pole starting a run and finished with intent to close in late to capture third nearing the wire. CENTENARY was hustled for the lead
into the first turn, became headstrong loose up front entering the backstretch to open up on the field at the half, began to weaken clinging to a diminishing
lead midpoint on the final turn, was collared by the winner in upper stretch and tired on the fence in the last sixteenth. TAKE CHANCES tracked two wide in
the early stages, could not get interested losing ground to others down the backstretch, was asked for run three furlongs from the wire and lacked a finish in
the stretch run. BAREFOOT SERVANTU was bumped inside on the break, tracked on the rail in the first turn, chased the lone pace down the back straight,
retreated midway on the far turn and could not be a factor running to the wire.

Footnotes
ECHO WITH LAUGHTER tracked three deep on the outside in the early going, took closer order to hound the pace outside three furlongs from home,
gained control at the quarter pole opening up by the time he entered the top of stretch and safely cruised home for the victory. GRAND AMBITION travelled
inside in the third flight with four furlongs from the finish, made no headway between runners losing positions midway through the turn, shifted outside in the
five path stubbornly fighting on at the top of the lane, found his best stride late and closed determinedly to be a clear second at the finish. DISCOVERY
CHART trailed the field inside down the back straightaway, could still see the field while looking for a seam at the quarter pole, was blocked behind runners
at the top of the lane, weaved through horses at the furlong pole and surged late bursting up the rail near the wire to capture third. IT'S ME MARIO was
improving four deep around horses at the half, continued a good sustained run circling three wide at the quarter pole to be in range of the leader five wide
for the stretch drive, chased the winner in upper stretch, wilted while on the wrong lead in the final sixteenth and was just edged out late for the third money.
MR. DE was bumped soundly on the break, settled three deep between foes near the rear down the backside, was scrubbed on gaining mildly three wide
outside horses through the turn, was in with a chance for a small share six wide for the stretch drive but stalled and levelled off in the final sixteenth.
SMOKIN HOLIDAY settled close to the back of the pack two deep between rivals at the half, was shuffled back to last three furlongs from the wire, angled
outside commencing a run at the quarter pole around foes, swung out widest in the seven path for the drive and ran on willingly to the finish. AMAZON
FORESTER stalked on the rail close to the rear in the early stages, made little impact running on the fence throughout the turn, had a clear path inside
turning for home and finished up mildly to the wire. PALACE RING broke out slightly on the start, tracked the pacesetter on the rail down the backside,
watched the contesting duo with three eights to go, came under a ride going in the wrong direction at the quarter pole, had little to give in the stretch run,
was pulled up galloping out and vanned back to the barn. BELLASPINA settled in mid-pack third flight three deep outside at the half, made a brief run
through the turn to be in the mix between runners for a minor role two furlongs from the prize but came up empty in the four path for the drive and flattened
out at the furlong marker. ONLY LOVE was loose on the lead down the backstretch, maintained a narrow advantage on the winner inside three furlongs
from the wire, was collared at the quarter pole and stopped on the fence in mid-stretch.
