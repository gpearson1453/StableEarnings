Footnotes
MONARCA DE ORO was quickest to the first turn, set the pace then turned back SHILSHOLE BAY into the stretch and drew away driving. SHILSHOLE
BAY pressed the winner then moved up to challenge into the second turn but outkicked to mid stretch and was an easy second. SODA SPRINGS broke out
about three paths, chased the winner to the backstretch then saved ground but weakened in the final furlong. MADAM PRESIDENT had no speed and was
always outrun..

HEAVENS TO BETSY stalked early then inherited the lead when YANKEE PANKEE bolted, saved ground to the stretch and held driving. ZEPHYR CAT
had no speed, bid two wide to the second turn then loomed a threat but was outkicked in the drive. SAINT HELEN tracked the pace, tried to rally three wide
but finished evenly in the lane. MANY MEMORIES had no speed, was two wide on the second turn and closed mildly. YANKEE PANKEE had the best
speed but bolted into the backstretch and remained extremely wide thereafter. UNLIMITED GLORY stalked the pace early then took up between horses into
the backstretch and did not recover. DIAMOND LUSTRE had brief speed then bled, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
HAKUNUI prompted the pace to the backstretch, moved past MYSTIC WOOD FORCE leaving the three eighths but crowded that one sliighlty then
responded steadily to prevail. MYSTIC WOOD FORCE set the pace to the backstretch then was passed by HAKUNUI but checked a bit when that one went
by, chased to the stretch but could not catch up. HASHTAG BAE tracked the pace to the far turn, was two wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late
response. FORT YORK trailed to the second turn while two wide then picked off rivals in the drive. BOY HOWDY was four wide early, tracked to the second
turn while three wide but came up empty in the drive. STANLEY RYDER had no speed and was not a factor. CAPES HOT ROCKET tracked in the early
stages then saved ground but gave way. Following a steward's inquiry into the action on the far turn, HAKUNUI was disqualified from first place and placed
second for interference to MYSTIC WOOD FORCE.

SMILING SALSA hustled to the front, set all the pace, edged away to the stretch and held driving. SASSY EINSTEIN was outsprinted early, rallied inside on
the second turn and was gaining slowly. LEAD ACTRESS broke a bit slow, raced four wide to the backstretch then eased in, saved ground to the stretch but
could not threaten the top two. CARDS N COFFEE also was away a step slow, hustled up to stalked the pace but lugged out six wide on the first turn and
was wide thereafter. MO SUGAFOOT pressed the winner early, got outkicked while three wide on the far turn and tired. ASTOUNDING ABBY was never a
factor.

D K'S CROWN had no speed, settled to the three eighths then set out after the leaders, swung out three wide then closed with a stout run to be along in
time. MASTER RECOVERY tracked the pace to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch, battled gamely, could not stall the winner but got the nod for
second. DAD BOD set all the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded in the drive but was bested for the win and nailed on the line for second.
BABY FRANKIE had no speed, saved ground to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. PERSEVERANCE had no speed and was not a threat.
WHATWASITHINKING pressed the pace for three eighths while two wide then gave way. N. K. ROCKET MAN broke out, hustled up to track the pace but
also gave way in the final furlong.

DANNY MICHAEL tracked the pace to the second turn, was three wide then angled in into the stretch and closed fast on the rail to be along in time.
ANTICIPATED dueled early then pushed past LET GEORGE DO IT but bumped that one, forcing him to steady, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then
dug in but was no match for the winner. LET GEORGE DO IT had good speed but was bumped by ANTICIPATED nearing the backstretch, steadied then
stalked to the second turn but weakened in the final furlong. LONGFORD tracked the pace from the rail to the second turn then came up empty. SCRATCH
ME stumbled badly to begin, had no speed and was outrun. SMOKIN KEN also had no speed and never was prominent. The stewards conducted an inquiry
into the incident between ANTICIPATED and LET GEORGE DO IT into the first turn and disqualified ANTICIPATED from second to third for interference.
