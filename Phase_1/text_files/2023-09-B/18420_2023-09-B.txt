Footnotes
ROAN FOR THE ROSE was rated early, four to three wide, then came four wide into the lane, closed well to get up in time to prove best, driving.
GETTIN'DOWNONIT was bumped at the start, then vied for the lead three wide, made a two wide bid leaving the quarter pole and was clear by the furlong
marker, but was denied on the wire to miss. MACHO HONCHO was reserved early, inside on the turn, angled out nearing the furlong marker and rallied well
late. MISCHIEF WARRIOR tracked the pace three to two wide, came three wide into the lane and finished willingly but needed more. MORNING MARCH
tracked the pace along the inside but lacked the needed closing kick. I LUCKED OUT set a fast pace on the inside, was headed on the turn, angled off the
inside by the furlong marker and faded. PROPHETS VOICE (IRE) was reserved early, three wide on the turn and had no rally. RIVERBOAT BANDIT was
unprepared at the start, not a factor. RUNAHOLIC was settled early, between rivals by the three eighths marker and weakened. FIGHTNOMOREFOREVER

Footnotes
LAKE NAKURU was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn and took over off the turn, then was clear by the furlong marker, but was
tired late and held on being saved by the wire to prove best, driving. DEVOTED KITTEN was settled back early, came six wide into the lane and closed fast
late to just miss. WARRIOR IN CHIEF was four wide into the first turn, set the fast pace towards the inside, was headed by the five sixteenths, then fell off
the pace leaving the turn, but was resurgent late to be gaining late but missed. ARISTOCAT pressed the pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn
to vie for command, but faded in the drive. DIGGERS DIAMOND was reserved early, swung out five wide leaving the turn and had a mild late rally but
needed more. VISHNU was off a step slow, then made a inside middle move on the backstretch but lacked a late kick. SAMARONTI was allowed to settle
early, came wide into the lane and had no rally. C C'S WARRIOR was well placed on the inside and tired in the drive.
