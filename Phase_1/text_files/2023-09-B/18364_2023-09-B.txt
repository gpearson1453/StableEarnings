Footnotes
GOIN' COASTAL dueled for the lead from MALICE TOWARD NONE to the sixteenth pole and gradually drew clear. MALICE TOWARD NONE dueled for
the lead to the sixteenth pole, was unable to stay with the winner late but continued on well for the place. BABY MARTINI was unhurried early, rallied
four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. FOREVER AMBER was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally.
NOW SAY SO saved ground while being allowed to settle but was not a factor. A FRIEND INDEED was off a step slow then raced six-wide and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
TRIBAL IMPACT prompted NEW EVERY MORNING from along the outside, responded to pressure and wore that one down in the final strides. NEW
EVERY MORNING saved ground setting the pace, drifted out slightly leaving the three-sixteenths pole and held on gamely during the drive to lose a tough
decision. FORTY SMOOCHES track the early pace racing along the inside, came two-wide into the stretch, angled back in during the drive and finished
strongly for third. COOLCROSS saved ground into the stretch while being allowed to settle, angled in nearing the eighth pole and rallied late. VALIDATE
was off a step slow then was unhurried, came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining ground late. ABRAAJ MIRAGE was forwardly placed to the stretch
while racing three-wide and weakened. UPPER ROOM dropped back early, came six-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SIX BLESSINGS was
prominent early while racing four-wide and tired.

Footnotes
SHESAHEATWAVE stalked the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to take the lead nearing the three-eighths pole, responded when challenged by LA
POPIS at the eighth pole and drew clear late. LA POPIS saved ground chasing the pace, angled out entering the stretch, moved up outside of
SHESAHEATWAVE to offer a bold bid at the eighth pole but was unable to sustain that move and held on well for second. WARREN'S MEMORABLE
saved ground while racing in the middle of the field, angled out to come four-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. LAKER JET was unhurried early,
came five-wide into the stretch and rallied late. NOMI LACKEE was allowed to settled rallied six-wide into the stretch and then went evenly late. BLOWING
BAYOU saved ground setting the pace for five furlongs and weakened. MS LYNN was allowed to settle in stride while racing three-wide and failed to be a
factor. FOR YOU ONLY prompted the pace from along the outside for five furlongs and tired. MUNNINGS TALE dropped back early and trailed throughout.

advantage. CROOKED FINGER RAY was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch, split rivals during the drive and finished fast.

four-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished well in a game effort. LOCHNESS prompted the issue while racing three-wide and weakened. MARKSMAN
ON TARGET dropped back early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. DARKSABER vied for the early lead from along the inside
and tired. BRONY BOY saved ground while being unhurried and failed to threaten. HEAT SEEKING LETA was unhurried early, came four-wide into the

clear late. TENNESSEE MOON vied with BIG MAMA THORTON for the lead from along the outside, came out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
then went in and held on well for second. SHELBY GOLD saved ground chasing the early pace, angled out to come three-wide into the stretch and finished
in a mild rally. HEART RIVER dropped back early, rallied six-wide into the stretch and gained her best stride too late. SHEMAKESCENTS settled in the
middle of the field, came four-wide into the stretch and then went evenly late. BIG MAMA THORNTON vied for the lead from along the inside to the stretch
and weakened. MS PARKSIDE showed early speed along the inside, dropped back on the turn and tired. MO CONNELLY saved ground while being

BLAZINGBELLABLU was four-wide on the first turn while being allowed to settle, moved up strongly while three-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished
fast to be up in the final strides. ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA vied for the lead from between horses while racing in hand, opened a clear lead after a half mile
and then just failed to last in a game effort. EMERALD SEA was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally for third.
ZIPPIN SEVENZ disputed the pace from along the inside and tired during the drive. SHE SAID MY WAY dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch
and improved her position. YOUNG LIFE LAURA was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. BRILLIANT BIRD
prompted the pace for a half mild and tired.

turn, came five-wide into the stretch, took the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and quickly drew clear. GOLD CRUSHER prompted ITS KRAKEN TIME from
along the outside, gained the lead nearing the eighth pole but was unable to resist the winner late in a game effort. ITS KRAKEN TIME broke in to brush
SLEW'S TIZ WHIZ then saved ground setting the pace into the stretch, could not stay with the top two late but held on well for third. NAVAL ESCORT
dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch and improved his position. SHERM saved ground while being unhurried early, came two-wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. TIME 'ER TOO was close up early while racing two-wide and weakened. MANGIA PANE chased the early pace racing along
the inside and tired.

Footnotes
MINER LEAGUE steadied from between horses nearing the seven-eighths pole, then angled out to be three-wide while stalking the pace, moved up to take
the lead nearing the quarter pole, opened a clear advantage and then was all out to prevail. BOURBON DANCER was unhurried early, moved up three-wide
on the turn, split rivals nearing the quarter pole and finished fast. GENERAL CROOK was forwardly placed racing between horses while two-wide, came
three-wide into the stretch and finished well for third in a steady effort. WHISKEY HARBOR stalked the pace racing along the inside, moved up two-wide
leaving the quarter pole, offered a bid nearing the eighth pole and then hung. LAPUSH prompted the issue to the stretch and weakened. PARKER'S
FIFTEEN dropped back early while racing five-wide, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and improved her position. RIMROCK LAKE settled in the
middle of the field while racing four-wide but lacked a rally when asked. LONESOME BOY saved ground while being allowed to settle but failed to seriously
threaten. DIGITAL SOLDIER settled in the middle of the field racing five-wide and was not a factor. WELL IMAGINE THAT ducked out sharply soon after the
start nearly unseating his rider causing him to lose his iron, then dropped back, had the rider recover the irons but was unable to recover the lost ground.
ALLANTE saved ground while being unhurried and failed to menace. CHANCELLORS BOOM set the pace for five furlongs and tired.

Footnotes
WESTERN DREAM set the pressured pace racing slightly removed from the rail, opened a clear lead nearing the eighth pole and increased her advantage.
KERRALIA was forwardly placed racing two-wide from between horses, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. RED PANTY NIGHT
prompted the pace from along the outside and held on fairly well for third. COCOA CENTS settled in the middle of the field, came three-wide into the stretch
and was gaining late. MISCHIEF MAMA was in tight along the inside on the first turn, then saved ground tracking the pace but lacked a rally. JACANA was
unhurried early, moved up four-wide on the turn, came six-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. DONTFORGETHESUGAR was prominent to
the stretch while racing four-wide and tired. TED'S CANDY GIRL hopped at the start then dropped far back and trailed. WILLING TO BURN reared at the
start to unseat her rider and was walked off following the race. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT AFTER VIEWING
THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.
