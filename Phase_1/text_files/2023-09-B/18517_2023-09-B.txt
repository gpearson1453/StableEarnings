MISS ELIANA three wide first turn while in hand at the half, went on to clear off in handy fashion to the wire. COMPUTER WHIZ kept up from inside through
the first turn, shuffled back and rebroke to rally on for place spot while no real threat for the winner. SHAKA'S LYRIC tried to keep up, shuffled back, in tight
at the three sixteenths pole and ran on for third with a gallant effort in the stretch run. GIMME CLEARANCE speed to the front, stayed to the half and faded
back in stretch. EMERALD EYES between horses to far turn, shuffled back into the turn with no late kick. SAVESOMEFORME good position while never far
back to the half with a steady decline. SWEETER THAN HONEY never factored with a steady fade throughout.

Footnotes
FAIRY CAKES (GB) speed to the front inside while well rated with the rider taking a peek back for company and clear off at ease as tons the best in handy
fashion to the wire. LOOKIN ROYAL bobbled a bit from the gate, secured good position while never far back, rallied along from far turn and no match for the
handy winner while clear of the rest. APRIL'S GEM tried to press winner to the half to no avail and faltered for the show spot. AUNT RUTH was never a real
factor throughout. BELLE OF ST. JOHN tried to keep up from inside to no avail and faltered back from the half. ELUSIVE JUSTICE bobbled at the start and
never a real factor throughout. STACK SHACK hustled early three wide first turn with a steady fade throughout.
