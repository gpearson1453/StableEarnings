Footnotes
TAPATIO LEO set the pace under pressure for a bit then cleared approaching the half-mile pole, opened up around the turn, remained well clear into the
final furlong under some coaxing and coasted in the final sixteenth. BARELY FUNTIONAL drifted in to bump rival shortly after the start, settled two wide, lost
path and altered to the inside at the five-sixteenths pole, showed a mild response to asking and bested the rest. SPIRITUAL ADVISOR tracked four wide
into the turn, spun six wide into the lane and finished evenly. CATEMACO unhurried in the beginning, chased four wide into the turn, angled out and came
seven wide into the stretch and showed a mild rally to earn a minor award. GEEZER climbed while chasing the top pair up the backstretch then jumped the
track at the seven-sixteenths pole, drifted out leaving the turn and weakened. ANDY CAN U HEAR ME chased wide up the backstretch, exited the bend six
wide and could not threaten. UNCLE JOHN got bumped and put in tight having to steady early, raced in tight at the three-eighths pole, angled out and came
five wide into the drive and could not rally. IRISH HEATWAVE traveled near the back, raced three wide into the lane, moved inward in the stretch and
lacked a rally. TOM AND JAZZY sat off the pace off the rail, exited the bend two wide and failed to menace. MR. DISRESPECTFUL pressed from outside
briefly then chased up the backstretch, lost his action at the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back around the turn and weakened.

PARK CITY vied for the lead into the first turn then ceded command to outer rivals, stalked up the backstretch, drew alongside the leader near the
five-sixteenths pole, dueled with SIPPIN N KISSIN down the lane and dug in to prevail. SIPPIN N KISSIN vied three deep around the first turn, fought
outside CARPE BELLUM in the middle stages, cleared that rival entering the far turn, met the challenge from PARK CITY past the five-sixteenths pole,
battled head to head through the stretch and finished gamely in defeat. TAKE CHARGE CURLY climbed along chasing in the two path, continued to climb
up the backstretch, remained two wide through the second bend, moved out in the lane and gained the show. CARPE BELLUM vied between foes early,
dueled inside SIPPIN N KISSIN on the backstretch, failed to keep up into the far turn, churned on through the lane and got edged for the show. RICH GOLD
bumped outer rival at the start, chased four deep or four wide on the clubhouse turn, remained wide through the second bend while starting to weaken and
came up empty in the drive. KENTUCKY BOURBON got bumped back leaving the gate, trailed four wide into the first turn then moved into the three path,

NORTH EAST STAR (IRE) set the pace inside STORMING GRAY then cleared approaching the half-mile pole, padded the lead through the turn and upper
stretch, coasted through the final furlong while widening widening further and was geared down nearing the wire. THIRTY CARATS chased along the inside,
tipped out late on the bend, could not make any headway on the winner in the stretch run but churned on for a clear second. GUITAR GIRL bobbled slightly
leaving the gate then got crowded early, chased two wide into the turn, angled out six wide and gained the show. STORMING GRAY closest in pursuit from
outside under coaxing, went three wide into the turn, moved into the two path then came back out to enter the stretch four wide and weakened. SPAIN
MOONLIGHT (IRE) raced up close briefly then dropped back, eased on the turn, pulled up at the top of the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
TEJON PASS set the pace inside COLORADO CRUISER, cleared that rival at the three-eighths pole, met the challenge from MR. LEASURE past the
eighth pole and responded well by turning that rival away and remained clear to the wire. MR. LEASURE chased from inside into the turn, angled three wide
late on the turn, launched a bid entering the final furlong, was turned away by the winner, drifted out and made minor contact with BARTHOLDY near the
sixteenth pole and held the place. BARTHOLDY chased three deep early, shifted in then back out at the half-mile pole, entered the lane four to five wide,
moved up to challenge three deep with a furlong left to run, got brushed lightly by MR. LEASURE at the sixteenth pole and could not get by that rival for
second. COLORADO CRUISER broke a step slow, went up to prompt the pace from outside, failed to keep up at the three-eighths pole, chased three wide
into the lane and weakened. WYNSTOCK brushed leaving the gate, steered out giving chase at the back, altered in from behind erratic rival leaving the
backstretch, went three then two wide around the turn and failed to menace. MAXIMUM CAPACITY chased between early, asked two wide then along the
inside into the stretch and weakened. BOLT AT MIDNIGHT broke a bit slow, traveled widest at the back, ridden along four wide through the turn and lacked
a response. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN BETWEEN MR. LEASURE AND BARTHOLDY. AFTER A REVIEW,
THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS LIGHT CONTACT BETWEEN THE RUNNERS, THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A
DISQUALIFICATION.

Footnotes
SPEED LANE up close three deep into the first turn then pressed from outside in hand, took over three wide leaving the far turn, put away inner rival then
dueled with LAKOTA SPIRIT through the final furlong and gamely prevailed. LAKOTA SPIRIT stalked from inside, angled out approaching the quarter pole,
challenged four wide into the stretch, battled SPEED LANE through the stretch and could not find the needed late kick to go by. GIMME MO BABY tracked
four then three wide on the clubhouse turn, traveled three deep up the backstretch, continued three wide on the far turn and was along for the show.
CORNELIA FORT led in the two path into the first turn, set the pace under pressure to the far turn, relinquished the lead past the quarter pole and
weakened. LUMINIFEROUS chased two wide early, traveled between foes up the backstretch, started to weaken on the far turn and had little left for the
drive.

DR. SCHIVEL bobbled a bit leaving the gate, moved up inside the leaders from inside, fought around the turn and into the lane, dueled with SPEED BOAT
BEACH in the final furlong and dug in to edge the runner-up. SPEED BOAT BEACH pressed the pace from outside then three deep up the backstretch,
fought with inner rivals through the turn, took over in upper stretch, battled with DR. SCHIVEL in the late stages and finished gamely in defeat. FORT
BRAGG stalked between foes, angled four wide around the bend, loomed from outside entering the final furlong but lacked the needed late kick in deep
stretch. SIR ATTICUS set the pace under pressure to the turn, maintained a short lead through the bend, lost command in upper stretch, stayed on to
midstretch and weakened late. AMERICAN THEOREM allowed to settle on the inside, steered out on the turn and came six wide into the lane and improved
position. VISITANT got bumped at the start, chased three deep into the turn, got shuffled a bit losing his path at the five-sixteenths pole and weakened down
the lane. ARABIAN LION stalked between then moved inside, saved ground through the turn, moved out in the lane and weakened. C Z ROCKET was off
slow to begin and bumped inner rival, saved ground through the turn and failed to menace. SPIRIT OF MAKENA fractious in the gate, stalked four deep,
came five wide into the drive and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
PETIT FILET away quickly in the beginning, prompted the pace three deep, chased the leader into the turn, drew alongside again past the five-sixteenths
pole, took over into the stretch, inched ahead with a furlong left to run and drew clear. ASADA FRIES sent for the lead and fought inside rivals for command,
cleared outer pair leaving the backstretch, pressured approaching the quarter pole, lost command into the lane, stayed on to midstretch then yielded to the
winner. COCKTAIL CUTIE tossed her head and brushed leaving the gate, chased along the inside to the lane and finished evenly next to the fence.
WAILEA SUNSET broke slow and got bumped inward at the start, dropped back and lagged behind early, went three wide into the turn, eased out and
came five wide into the stretch, finished with a belated rally and rounded out the superfecta. SIGNORA VITTORIA broke in to brush rival, also dropped back
early, traveled along the inside into the turn, angled out and exited the bend five wide and summoned a mild rally. SASSY PRANCELOT got knocked into
rival at the start, chased five wide into the turn, angled down to the three path around the bend and weakened. KITZKATY chased off the inside, got shuffled
back at the three-eighths pole, angled to the rail and had little left for the stretch. LOOKATHERGLIDE broke in and bumped, tracked out of range six wide
into the turn, moved in some to enter the lane four wide and weakened. ANNIE FOX pressed the pace from between foes early, could not stay with the
leader into the turn, dropped back around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
SLOW DOWN ANDY away quickly to establish the front and showed the way a bit off the rail into the first turn, showed the way into and around the far turn
along the inside, roused approaching the top of the stretch, put to right handed urging and remained clear to the wire. DEFUNDED stalked the pacesetter
from inside to the far turn, shifted to the two path, asked left handed approaching the quarter pole, chased determinedly through the lane but had to settle
for second best. SENOR BUSCADOR settled in the two path near the back, advanced two wide around the far turn, steered out in the lane and finished with
a mild late bid to earn the show honors. NATIONAL TREASURE stalked two wide between rivals early, traveled three deep leaving the backstretch, put in a
mild bid three wide around the far turn but flattened in the final furlong. SKINNER trailed four wide on the clubhouse turn, continued at the back off the inside
into the second bend, went two wide into the lane and improved position. BYE BYE BOBBY pulled early and went two wide around the clubhouse turn,
saved ground around the second bend and failed to menace. CELESTIAL MOON stalked in the two path, roused between rivals entering the far turn,
started to weaken around that bend, ridden to upper stretch, tired and was not persevered with in the final furlong. PIROLI got crowded leaving the gate,
tracked four wide early, raced in mid-pack to the far turn, rounded that bend five wide, eased in the lane and walked off. STILLETO BOY chased three deep
early, four deep on the backstretch, lost ground on the far turn, tired and eased in the lane and walked off.

encouragement. BRAN (FR) tracked from inside, inched closer around the turn, roused leaving the bend, lacked room in upper stretch, altered out into the
clear and finished gamely to get up for second. NOBLE REFLECTION took control early and set the pace up the backstretch, led along the rail through the
turn, headed by LANE WAY at the eighth pole, relinquished the lead midstretch, stayed on gamely from inside and got edged for second. I'M A GAMBLER
(IRE) chased outside a rival then between runners, moved out in the lane and finished willingly four deep late. MAS RAPIDO (GB) settled off the pace,
advanced on the inside around the bend and finished evenly late. SUMTER dropped back in the early, jumped crossing onto the dirt then back onto the turn,
went between rivals leaving the backstretch, lacked room around the bend and upper stretch, altered out midstretch and could not rally.
UNCONQUERABLE KEEN (IRE) reserved in the early going, bothered by inner rival up then steadied at the seven-sixteenths pole, traveled three deep on
the turn then tipped out further and could not rally. BALNIKHOV (IRE) broke a step slow, jumped crossing on to the dirt then lagged behind, saved ground
through the turn and improved position. PACKS A WAHLOP forwardly placed early, was a bit rank approaching the half-mile pole, chased three then four
deep on the turn, got crowded between rivals at the sixteenth pole and was ridden out. RADICAL RIGHT chased in the two path into the turn, lost positions
two then three wide around the bend and faded. AH JEEZ tracked out of range four deep into the turn, remained wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
HONG KONG HARRY (IRE) rated along the inside, inched closer into the far turn, waited for room behind the leader, tipped out and launched a bid with a
furlong left to run and edged past the runner-up in the final sixteenth. ASTRONOMER cleared and crossed over to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch,
met the challenge from the winner at the eighth pole and yielded grudgingly. TWIST (FR) settled inside, tipped out into the lane, roused once in the clear
and finished willingly for the show honors. HIT THE ROAD rated between and had to pause when running up on heels around the clubhouse turn, chased
out of range two wide into the far turn, angled out into the stretch, finished determinedly down the lane but had the rider lose the whip at the sixteenth pole
and went evenly late. CATHKIN PEAK (IRE) pulled in the early going and traveled in the two path, raced three deep leaving the backstretch, angled to the
inside late on the far turn and went evenly along the fence. IRIDEO (ARG) unhurried in the beginning and angled down to the inside trailing the field,
continued at the back while saving ground to the stretch, had the rider lose his crop past the eighth pole and improved position. WAR AT SEA stalked two
then three wide around the first turn, driven three wide into the lane and weakened. IL BELLATOR keen along the inside and shifted to the two path chasing
into the first turn, roused around the far turn, got floated out into the lane and weakened. FLAVIUS stalked three deep early, got floated six wide into the
stretch and weakened.
