Footnotes
MICHELE M. assumed the lead from the start, set a modest pace down the backstretch, quickened away from the chasing rival on the turn while not being
asked, opened up on the field at the top of the lane and was geared down late for the comfortable win at the wire. HOLIDAY WITH AMY was unhurried
outside trailing down the backside, caught up to the field lengthening stride midway on the turn in the three path, shifted outside off rivals in the four path for
the stretch drive and won the battle for second place nearing the wire. O WOW settled in midpack on the rail at the half, was urged for more run at the
quarter pole, fought between runners for the runners up share through the stretch and was outfinished late settling for third money in the end. P. S. RISING
STAR travelled outside in midfield with four furlongs to go, was hard ridden between foes three eighths from the finish, offered no response and had little to
show in the drive to the wire. EXECUTIVE EFFECT hounded the pace outside down the back straight, was coaxed for more chasing the winner through the
turn, could not keep up at the quarter pole and backed away on the fence in upper stretch.

Footnotes
GAMBLE'S ORB hit gate stumbling on the break, recovered to track the frontrunner alone at the half, inched closer to the front through the turn, collared the
leader turning for home, poked her head in front at the eighth pole and prevailed from a re-rallying foe at the wire. TAVALINE took command from the onset
setting brisk fractions down the backside, continued setting a quick pace up front but by a diminishing margin throughout the turn, was headed outside at the
top of the lane, ceded the lead at the furlong marker and resurged late to just lose the nod at the finish. SOCIETY'S KAT tracked the pacesetter three deep
early on, was roused trying to match strides with the top two at the three furlong marker, determinedly chased the front pair in upper stretch and was gaining
mildly late in the final furlong but could not get there in time. ROCKET RILEY was allowed to settle trailing on the rail down the back straight, began to pick
up horses extended her stride at the quarter pole, angled outside with momentum in the four path driving to the finish and ran on willingly to the wire for a
minor role in the end. EGBERT J settled outside close to the back of the pack in the early stages, was hard ridden outside runners making little impression
throughout the turn and could not be factor finishing up between foes down the stretch. SILVER BULLET LADY stalked near the rear on the rail down the
backside, was nudged for more run on the fence three furlongs from the prize making little headway and yielded on the rail in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
JILL pressed the issue on the rail down the back straight, edged away for a narrow lead on the rail running through the turn, was headed outside
straightening out for the drive, repel that foe by the eighth pole and had a little something left in reserve to hold off the closer at the finish. I'M INTO
MISCHIEF was reined back outside watching the contesting front duo down the backside and turn, began to close in on the engaging leaders on the fence
turning for home, split horses at the sixteenth pole and just missed with a late surge for the win. IMA BEAST had a slim lead outside down the backstretch,
was relegated to the chaser just outside on the turn, bid outside in the four path bobbing heads up front in upper stretch and could not find another gear late
fading near the wire while holding barely for third in the end. SOUPER PECAN travelled on the rail in midpack, lost ground to runners inside through the turn
and closed widest in the five path down the lane to just miss getting up for third at the wire. WEEHAWKEN was roused early on to get involved leaving the
gate, stalked three deep outside foes at the half, was hard ridden two wide outside rival gaining position on the turn and made up ground on the leaders in
the stretch but lost a placing at the finish. OLD SECRETS missed the break trailing down the backside, could see the field shifting inwards from the four path
at the top of the lane and was never a presence in the drive down the stretch.

Footnotes
SILENT SKY settled just off the leader racing about three wide, dropped back a bit early on the turn, moved out four wide at the top of the stretch with aim,
struck the lead past the three-sixteenths, drew clear and held safe. CRY FREEDOM shifted in late up the backstretch, raced off the pace two to three wide
between runners through the turn, came out five wide in upper stretch, gained the place but was only second best. FINANCIAL ADVICE (FR) shadowed the
pacesetter from outside, applied further pressure late on the turn, took the lead at the quarter pole, was soon overtaken, had no extra but maintained show
honors. MONEY BEETS soon moved clear and shifted in, set the pace inside, was hounded into the turn, overtaken by the top of the stretch, lacked the
needed late kick but kept on well enough for the minor award. PAINTED GLORY broke outwardly just a bit, raced outside foes a bit headstrong in the early
going, went four to five wide on the turn, needed more. HELIOCENTRIC pursued from mid-pack three to four wide, failed to rally. SASSINESS broke just a
half-step slowly, was a bit rank in the very early going, moved up inside heading to the turn, faltered in the lane. ALL FOR HONOR was forced out just a bit
at the start, unhurriedly brought up the rear off the inside, was never near enough to threaten. STORMS OF LIFE saved ground on the turn, was not a
factor.

Footnotes
SPEED TRAP stalked on the rail in the third flight down the backside, was coaxed for more angling outside with a quarter mile to run to be in the hunt widest
in the five path for the drive, found her best stride late and rallied to draw away in the final sixteenth. SCOTTISH SYMPHONY contested upfront between
rivals at the start, emerged alone dictating terms at the half mile marker, set the pace running through the turn, was clinging onto the lead when challenged
by multiple foes at the top of the stretch, battled on stubbornly down the lane but was no match for the closing winner late. HAPPY VALENTINE pressed on
the rail in the beginning, was in a good position nestled behind the frontrunner at the half, waited inside under a snug hold on the rail midpoint on the turn,
angled out bidding for the lead at the quarter pole and could not find more late having little finish in the final furlong. GAYELETTE had a good position
tracking the front trio outside but was eager fighting the restraint of the rider down the backstretch, moved three wide gaining outside foes midway on the
turn, posed a threat in the four path straightening out to the finish and could only gain mildly late to be involved for the third place finish photo in the end.
EME CLAIRE co-trailed on the inside down the backside, made little impact running inside throughout the turn and could not reach contention running down
the lane. ADMISSIBLE broke out at the start, had a slim lead three deep in the early going, chased three wide at the half mile marker outside foes, was
scrubbed on trying to keep up with the leaders through the turn but to no avail and retreated inside at the quarter pole. KAVALA co-trailed on the outside
down the back straightaway, was roused outside just off the fence at three eighths marker, could not make any headway, lost touch with the field in upper
stretch and galloped across the wire.

Footnotes
CARSON'S RUN was reserved in the early going, bided time in last on the turn, was guided out coming to the five-sixteenths angling ten wide into the
stretch, struck the front in mid-stretch and kicked clear under steady handling. MY BOY PRINCE headed back to the paddock after the post parade for a
shoe repair, moved to the lead soon after the start, set the pace racing just off the hedge and shadowed by outside foes. GO WITH GUSTO exchanged a
very light bump at the start, dropped back in the early going racing off the inside about two to three deep, put to urging late on the turn, angled eight to nine
wide into upper stretch, kept on evenly and missed second. TUNECHI exchanged incidental contact at the start, stalked from between runners about three
wide and in the second flight late on the turn, came out six wide in upper stretch, evened out. SOUPER ATTENTIVE settled mid-division racing off the inside
in the two path, dropped back on the turn, came out path at the top of the stretch, ran on. WESTERN WHIRL broke outwardly, prompted the early pace from
outside, shadowed the runner-up three wide into the turn, drifted about in the stretch while weakening. KING OF THE TRACK was a bit hard to control when
placed in tight quarters early by an inside rival, advanced some outside three to four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch seven deep and weakened.
AIROSA shifted in tracking the leaders inside through the turn, made no bid. BUCYK broke a step slowly and in tight, pulled against the rider's restraint
keenly moving forward four wide, was up close through the turn, faded in the stretch.

PATCHES O'HOULIHAN hounded the frontrunner outside down the back straight, forced the issue outside around the bend, appeared briefly to be giving
away the the pacesetter in upper stretch but was resilient in the final furlong to resurge under a patient ride to get up and hold off the closers for the victory.
LAST AMERICAN EXIT watched the contesting twosome down the backside, continued to sit with five sixteenths to go, keeping close order to the dueling
pair through the turn, began to reel in the leaders at the quarter pole to be in the thick of things four wide at the top of the lane and determinedly finished up
just missing out in a gutsy effort. SECRET RESERVE stalked near the rear on the outside in the beginning, was hard ridden three wide outside horses
gaining momentum at the quarter pole, split foes in mid-stretch, shifted just outside late and closed with a rush but was not in time. ROCKCREST had a slim
lead down the backstretch, continued setting the pace while pressed by the winner outside on the turn, edged clear looking good at the top of the lane, was
game in defeat to the wire but just faded some nearing the finish to hold for a minor share. SOUPER WATSON was unhurried trailing down the backside,
still could see the field saving ground on the turn, was full of run late to be flying up the fence in the last sixteenth of a mile but could not catch the winner.
OLD CHESTNUT settled in midfield all alone early on, improved on the fence when urged with three furlongs to go, was in range of the leaders at the top of
the lane, had a strong chance at the eighth pole but stalled between runners in deep stretch. MY BUDDY B kept a close eye on the top duo three deep
outside foes tracking down the backside, rallied three wide outside runners three furlongs from the wire to be in the mix for a share in the five path turning
for home, could not find more late and evened out in the final furlong. OUTLAW KID tracked the engaging front pair between rivals down the back straight,
came under a ride making little advancement on the turn and faded with rivals on either side in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SHE FEELS PRETTY was bumped fairly hard at the start, settled into stride off the pace, began to advance outside on the turn four wide, came into upper
stretch five to six deep, struck the lead near the three-sixteenths, kicked clear and was kept to the task. SIMPLY IN FRONT stalked in behind the leaders
between runners, moved nearer the inside past the three-quarters, saved ground near the rail through the turn, came out a bit making a brief and mild bid
two to three deep and between runners past the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but kept on to secure the place. DAZZLING STAR (GB) broke a
step slowly, switched out off the inside and advanced between runners, went three to four wide through the turn, came out six wide in upper stretch, ran on
but needed more. OZARA (IRE) bobbled just slightly at the start, was well-placed stalking the leaders three to four wide into the turn, lacked the needed late
kick. GOLDEN CANARY was just a bit reluctant to load, got away well and quickly to the fore, set the pace inside on or just off the rail, weakened in the
stretch. DANCING DUCHESS settled off the pace inside, steadied on heels near the half, came out a bit at that juncture, angled out further past the
three-sixteenths bumping and bothering rivals near the furlong grounds, ran on. READY TO JAM rated in behind two to three wide between foes to the turn,
came out in upper stretch, ran on evenly. RHAPSODY stalked from just outside the pacesetter into the turn, went two to three wide, asked for more by
upper stretch but weakened. BOLT ENOREE settled at the back, fanned nine wide into upper stretch, was bumped nearing the eighth pole. DEA MATRONA
(FR) broke just a hair slowly, settled off the pace, raced mostly three to five wide, was bumped into a rival near the eighth pole. SHE'S FIRE bumped with
the outer rival at the start, pursued the leaders three to four wide into the turn, weakened. MS. TART tracked from inside in behind the leaders into the turn,
steadied outside the half-mile marker, dropped back and failed to threaten. BROCKNARDINI hopped slightly at the start, moved out racing three to five wide
on the turn and toward the back, fanned eight wide into upper stretch, was bumped into a rival and steadied near the eighth pole. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY DANCING DUCHESS WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SIXTH AND PLACED LAST BEHIND BROCKNARDINI FOR CAUSING
INTERFERENCE TO THAT AND OTHER RIVALS NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE IN A CHAIN REACTION.

Footnotes
MASTER OF THE SEAS (IRE) broke a step slowly, settled at the back switching off the inside, went two to three wide on the turn inching closer, swung out
seven wide for the drive, struck the lead past the three-sixteenths and powered away under vigorous hand urging. SHIRL'S SPEIGHT settled inside off the
pace, bided time through the turn then angled out eight wide leaving that bend, followed the winner, was bumped by a drifting rival in late stretch but kept on
to secure the place over that one. LUCKY SCORE stalked outside mid-pack, went three to four wide on the turn, floated out turning for home, was bumped
by a rival in upper stretch, drifted out in mid-stretch and bumped a rival late, was outfinished for second. WAR BOMBER (IRE) switched outside the leader
stalking two to three wide through the turn, drifted out leaving that bend and in contention, drifted more and bumped a rival in upper stretch, ran on. ICE
CHOCOLAT (BRZ) raced mid-pack near inside, dropped back in the two path on the turn, came again making moderate progress in upper stretch but went

Footnotes
CRUDEN BAY travelled in the middle of the pack between foes in the two path in the early going, rallied splitting runners three furlongs from the wire,
loomed the main threat four wide turning for home and under a vigorous ride wore down a stubborn frontrunner in deep stretch. J P HELLISH took
command from the onset, set a modest pace up front hounded down the backside, dictated the pace through the final turn having a narrow advantage
straightening out for the drive, was clinging onto the lead with a sixteenth to go but could not hold off the winner just before the wire. SOUPER COHIBA
prompted three wide into the first turn, was content sitting outside off the flank of the pacesetter down the backstretch, began to inch closer through the far
turn, bid in the three path with rivals on either side for the drive to the wire but stalled in mid-stretch holding for show in the end. U S ARMY CORPS tracked
in midfield on the rail, watched the front two down the backside, chased the leaders on the far turn matching strides saving ground inside but could not find
more late and was one paced on the fence settling for a minor role. RAPPER ZAPPER stalked near the rear two wide for the first half of the race, improved
on the rail running throughout the final turn and finished up willingly inside down the lane. ARGENTIUM stumbled plus was squeezed at start to trail in the
early stages, could still see the field taking closer order through the far turn and had some late interest to pass weary runners in the stretch. CALL CURT
settled in midfield three wide on the first of two turns, advanced smartly outside down the back straight tracking the front pair at the half, could not quicken
with the winner inside three furlongs from the prize and gave way between horses in mid stretch. OCTOBER FROST stalked close to back three deep into
the first turn, continued near the rear position unchanged down the backside, could not make any impact through the far turn and tired while widest in the
five path at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
HADDASSAH had a ideal set up by oneself watching the engaged pair down the backside, waited to pounce on the fence through the turn, had a clear lane
five wide two furlongs from the line, opened up to clear drifting in under right handed urging at the furlong pole and was kept to the task to win comfortably at
the finish. ELUSIVE KNIGHT relaxed trailing the field down the backstretch, began to creep closer to the field gaining momentum at the seven sixteenths
marker, swung out widest in the nine path full of run straightening out for the stretch drive, chased the winner in vain late besting the rest for a clear second.
MIDNIGHT IN MALIBU settled outside near the rear in the early going, moved smartly around foes four wide progressing on the turn, swung out to the eight
path for the drive to the wire to have a share of the lead in upper stretch and finished with intent to be a solid third crossing the line. DANCIN IN DA'NILE
was alone in the third flight down the back straight, rated kindly on the turn, sat behind a wall of runners six wide for the stretch drive, shifted in going for a
seam in the three path with three sixteenths to go, weaved between foes and got up for a minor role in the end. BODE'S TIPSY ducked inwards sharply
leaving the chute, recovered quickly to improve to midpack switching outside three deep at the half, tracked in the second flight two wide outside on the turn,
ran gamely to be in the hunt in the six path at the quarter pole but faded late drifting in at the sixteenth pole. BRITISH ROYALTY settled near the rear on the
fence in the beginning, offered a good turn of foot running between foes with three eighths remaining, had a clear path three wide at the top of the lane,
could not accelerate quick enough, lost the seam inside the three sixteenths marker, was then steadied on the fence and could not recover to be involved at
the finish. TOP OF THE CHARTS travelled in the middle of the pack on the rail, saved ground keeping up with rivals through the turn, try to rally on the
fence with a quarter to go, was in tight inside at the three sixteenths marker, had nowhere to run, shifted outside in the two path late and could not be a
factor at the finish. KEROUAC took this field down the backside, maintained a slim advantage running on the turn, could not find more turning for home and
was swallowed up by the closing pack in mid -stretch. MAD MOCHA hopped at the break, prompted outside down the back straight, pressed the pace two
wide throughout the turn, poked his head in front momentarily at the top of the lane and stopped between rivals with three sixteenths to run.

Footnotes
JOKES UP broke inwards at the start, had a good position watching the contesting duo at the half, waited to pounce under a snug hold throughout the turn,
took control outside at the furlong marker and had enough left to hold safe late for the win. KANTBACKOFF was forced inside to start, waited behind
runners when the field bunched up at the three furlong marker, was nudged on the maintain position between horses at the quarter pole, bullied her way
through in the three path with an eighth to go and was gaining strongly late but could not get there in time. ONDINE LADY pressed the issue up front down
the backstretch on the fence, slipped through on the rail three furlongs from home, opened up mildly at the quarter pole, gave way to the fast closing winner
with a sixteenth remaining and faded late to dead heat for third money in the end. HITS DIFFERENT was pushed in at the start, tracked the top three on the
rail down the backside, was scrubbed on for more run midpoint on the turn, never gave up and gamely fought on with rivals on each side to close in to
capture third in a dead heat at the finish. TALKING WONDERS was bumped on the break trailing down the backside, caught up to the field moving well on
the fence at the three furlong marker, was checked on the rail with a quarter to go, stubbornly re-rallied inside for the stretch drive but stalled in the last
sixteenth. NEOLITHIC NATION travelled four deep near the back in the beginning, made little progress throughout the turn and finished mildly down the
stretch. GUNNAWIN settled near the rear three deep early on, could not keep up with rallying horses with five sixteenths to go, swung outside runners four
wide at the quarter pole, continued shifting outwards to be widest in lane eight for the drive and had no finish to give running to the wire. CANTHO stalked in
midpack three wide outside horses down the back straight, was hard ridden trying to go after the leaders midway on the turn, had a chance for a small share
between foes at the top of the lane but levelled off at the furlong marker. SEATTLE SIGNAL set the pace down the backstretch just off the rail, surrendered
the lead in the two path with three eighths to go, gave way getting out five to six wide at the quarter pole and retreated in upper stretch.
