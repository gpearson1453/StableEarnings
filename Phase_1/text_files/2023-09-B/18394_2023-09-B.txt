MY BATON ROUGE broke sharply to a clear lead drawing off on the turn being ridden out the final sixteenth. CONSTITUTIONALIST chased the pace losing
ground to the leader on the turn proving no match down the lane staying after it to secure place. BAY OF ANGELS slow early saved ground to upper stretch
giving a mild rally along the rail. SECRET SEDUCTION chased the pace through the turn weakening along the inside the final eighth. QUITCHERSNIVELIN
slow early played no factor. TOP MULE raced mid pack tiring in upper stretch. CONDUTTORE was always outrun.
