REDOUTE'S LIGHT was well back, closed the gap on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew clear. A I INITIATIVE was off the
pace, moved up from the inside on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished well. HALF LIT was unhurried early, a factor on the far
turn and had the lead from the four path in mid stretch but was outfinished. DIAMONDBACK set the pace and had a clear lead on the far turn but was
headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. FOUR KNIGHTS stalked the early leader but chased on the far turn and dropped back through the stretch.

JARA was unhurried early, took command on the turn and was much the best. SHELLY THE ROCKET stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn
but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. SWEET FINALE settled off the pace, had a mild gain on the turn and from the
four path at the top of the stretch was up for show. PACENZA was in range and roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no
response. LOUEMMA was in touch and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. REMEMBEROLDTYMES showed speed from the inside but chased
on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
GIMBALA tracked the early leader, was a factor on the turn and from the three path at he top of the stretch proved best. STORMING LADY was in touch
and moved up on the turn but lacked room in mid stretch and was second best. GREEN GABLES set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and vied to mid
stretch but was all out. SIMPLE SOUVENIR was off the pace and trailed the field on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more.
SNEAKY REBEL was in range early but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

Footnotes
CRUMLIN BIRD was unhurried early, saved ground on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch rallied in time. FRERET stalked the early
leader, dueled on the turn and had the lead from the three path in mid stretch but was caught late. BABY MO set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the
turn, vied through the stretch and held show. HASN'T HIT ME YET was up close and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch
needed more. MS. P'S BELLA was in range and had a mild gain on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. SILVER TUNES
was hustled early and had a good position on the turn but faded late. BETTABE SWIFT was off slow and showed little in a dull effort.
