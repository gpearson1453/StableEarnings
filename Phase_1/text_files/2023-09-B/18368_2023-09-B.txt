LUCKY FORCE broke sharply and tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide through the
final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to get up in the closing strides. ROCKCLIFFE away well and pressed the pace from the outside of INDTETTA
entering the backstretch, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside, rallied two wide while continuing to challenge for the lead entering the final
turn, took a narrow lead in mid stretch, but was unable to hold off LUCKY FORCE in the closing strides. INDYETTA away alertly and raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly in deep stretch
in a solid effort. WICKED NIGHT tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied from just
off the rail entering the final turn, shifted four wide in mid stretch and finished with late interest. TIME TICKER unhurried early while dropping well behind the
rest of the field entering the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive, but was left too
much to do.

through the final turn, appeared to take the narrowest of advantages into the lane, but was unable to put away a stubborn ADDENDUM, fought fought back
from along the inside and drew clear in deep stretch. I'M ALL SHOOK UP away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn,
dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch, was quickly tackled by ADDENDUM entering the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on that rival midway
through the turn, and faded in the late stages. HOAX ducked in at the start, and unseated her rider. HOAX was pulled up with the assistance of an outrider

STAR FINALITY away alertly and tracked the pacesetter one out from the rail entering the backstretch, set sail after the leader two wide entering the final
turn, assumed command midway through the turn, and drew clear late as much the best. PENALTY TO RANGERS broke sharply and raced to the lead
from along the rail entering the backstretch, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, was quickly
overtaken midway through the turn, and drew clear in the lane as much the best. DRILL BABY DRILL stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving
ground at the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly five wide in the drive to garner a share. TEXAS LEGACY settled off the early
pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backside, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the stretch drive.
PERFECT PENNY settled well off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon. AUNTIE J stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, struggled to keep up
approaching the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
BELLAROO was off a step slow and settled at the back of a compact field while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, commenced
her bid two wide entering the final turn while briefly awaiting room, tipped five wide entering the lane, and closed with a rush to prove best. LASTING LIGHT
broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from the inside of ANAAMY in the run down the
backside and into the final turn, got the better of her pace rival leaving the turn, but was unable to fend off the late charge by BELLAROO while drifting out
late. RICHARDS COMMAND tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn,
and battled on determinedly four wide into he drive in a solid effort. QUALITY COMMAND away well and tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch
while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside through the final turn, angled three wide to split rivals in mid stretch, but was forced to
take up when losing her path late. ANAAMY away alertly and pressed the pace from the outside of LASTING LIGHT in the run down the backside and
through the final turn, was unable to match strides with her pace rival entering the lane, and was outfinished in the stretch drive. HARLAN'S ANGEL went to
her knees at the start to get away poorly, rushed into a stalking trip three wide midway down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but
faded in the late stages. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul, into an incident in mid stretch. The rider of QUALITY
COMMAND lodged a claim of foul against the rider of LASTING LIGHT for alleged interference in deep stretch. After review the claim of foul was upheld,
and LASTING LIGHT was disqualified from second and placed fourth, for drifting out, and impeding the progress of QUALITY COMMAND.
