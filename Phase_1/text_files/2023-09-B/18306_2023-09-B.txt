Footnotes
MERRY MAKER (IRE) was off at the rear of the field, saved ground at the back, moved out after turn four, jumped outward at fences nine and ten, was
urged four wide on the final turn, rallied seven wide into the stretch, closed strongly on the far outside and got up to prevail. L'IMPERATOR (FR) was well
placed just off the pace on the inside while jumping well, moved out into the stretch, took the lead around the three-sixteenths, drifted out under threat late
and was caught while clear for the place. BARBADOS (IRE) settled towards the back, struggled over fence ten then stumbled and safely secured the show
while no threat to the top two. SNAP DECISION went to the front, showed the way while jumping well, was asked on the final turn, lost the advantage in
upper stretch and weakened. CITY DREAMER (IRE) jumped well while near the middle of the field, was urged before fence nine and lacked the needed
response. PROVEN INNOCENT settled towards the outside, moved closer after the fourth turn, struggled over fence nine and failed to respond.
RESTITUTION (FR) tracked the pace on the outside, jumped poorly at fences six and eight then faltered and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
BLACK RAIN coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn and was patiently handled until set down
spinning three to four wide into upper stretch when under challenge to the outside, dug in head to head clinging to command a furlong out while widening
away from the rest as a pair, repelled the challenge and gamely inched away in the late stages to prevail. QUALITY CHIC chased just off the inside until
tucked inside at the five-eighths, angled out four to five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a at the head of the stretch, dug in head to head through to
the sixteenth marker fighting on but was ultimately rebuffed inside that station while well clear of the rest and along second best. CLOUD FOREST grew
detached at the tail of the field early on and chased along the inside, tipped two then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled in to take the inside route into upper stretch, improved position running on to secure the show honors while never threatening the top pair.
STRAPPED hustled from the gate, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, weakened
in the drive. OPPORTUNITY SET chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
three wide into upper stretch and tired. BRAGGADOCIOUS chased three then two wide, retreated into the turn while just off the inside, continued to back
away taking the two path into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish well behind.

Footnotes
AGGELOS THE GREAT broke out then was hustled, chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, pursued the runner-up under a drive
into the final sixteenth and got up late under strong handling. YO BANANA BOY went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two
path on the turn, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, led until the final strides but was denied while clear for the place. QUIET
WISDOM tossed his head at the start then bumped very hard with a rival, was well placed just off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail while
drafting behind the leader on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, chased behind the top two to the finish and lacked the needed kick while well clear
for the show. CATALINA CRUSH broke a half-step slow, settled under some urging, came under stronger encouragement in the four path on the turn and
lacked the needed response. ALBEDO was coaxed along on the inside, lost action badly inside the half-mile pole then dropped back into the turn, saved
ground through that bend and came up empty. SLAMMIN GOLD bumped very hard with a foe at the start then was taken up, spotted the front several
lengths, was urged along at the rear, went five wide on the turn and was no factor. IN A MINUTE broke a step slow, settled off the pace, was urged three
then two wide on the turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
SWEETIE tracked the pace along the inside, tipped to the two path placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped
three wide at the three-sixteenths briefly nudging GOLDEN ROCKET, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command at the sixteenth
marker, then inched away to the finish to prevail. SPINNING COLORS three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued three
wide into upper stretch, got nudged near the three-sixteenths by the aforementioned foe, dug in under a drive running on to secure the place honors.
STELLA MARS established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took
the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and relented a sixteenth from home, kept on to preserve the show honors. GOLDEN ROCKET
attended the leader to the outside in the two path, came under coaxing near the quarter pole when that rival attempted to slip away, cornered just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in head to head to the sixteenth marker challenging for command when overthrown by the eventual winner in tandem with her
main pace foe, kept on to the finish. ORANGE FREEZE two to three wide in pursuit from the tail of the field, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home,
angled four wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced through to the finish. COLLABORATION grew fractious and leapt straight up in the gate just as the
latch was sprung bulling the assistant starter off his perch knocking him back over the side of the stall as he held tight to his charge out of necessity to
protect both horse and the rider, who himself did a masterful job to stay in the saddle despite being briefly seated looking skyward, got away well behind
once back on all fours and was escorted by outrider having lost all chance. Following a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, COLLABORATION was declared a
non-starter prior to the race being declared official.

GUT FEELING stalked the pace on the outside, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths pole, was asked in the three path on the turn, made an outside bid in
upper stretch, took the lead just inside the furlong marker, fought with the runner-up to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. MAMA'S
GOLD showed speed on the outside then pressed the pace, took the lead in the two path outside the three-eighths, was asked for his best in upper stretch,
lost the advantage just inside the furlong marker, fought on gamely to the finish but missed while able to get the place. GOOD RAPPORT brushed with a
rival at the start, was well placed just off the pace, chased inside to the two path on the turn, pursued the leader into upper stretch, altered out behind horses
nearing the furlong marker, pursued the top two to the finish and willingly earned the show. HAPPY BOB went to the front, showed the way under pressure
to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead outside the three-eighths, dropped back nearing the quarter-pole, came off the rail in the stretch
and weakened. STRONG LIGHT bobbled at the start then brushed with a foe, lagged at the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. SCOTTO was
hustled from the gate, fell well back while showing no speed, dropped from the six path to the four path on the turn, moved to the three path into the stretch
and showed little. INSPECTOR was off a step slow, swerved in leaving the chute then angled to the rail, dropped back under a strong hand-ride leaving the
backstretch, raced inside to the two path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and faltered.

off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home, ran on to secure the show honors. CHARLIE'S

Footnotes
DONTLOOKBACKATALL went to the front then moved clear, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when shaken up in upper
stretch, was put to the crop inside the furlong marker and proved much the best under steady urging. PLAY THE MUSIC settled on the outside, was roused
three wide on the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and proved no match while just able to get the place. DEKANTER was well placed while rated just
off the pace on the inside, saved ground while let out on the turn, chased the winner in the stretch and just missed the place while able to get the show.
QUEEN OLLY (IRE) settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed
kick. FEATHERS (IRE) settled at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, shifted in inside the
three-sixteenths and failed to rally. LADY MIA (FR) tracked the pace, tugged keenly on the bit under tight restraint near the nine-sixteenths, was let out in
the two path on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and came up empty. GEORGEES SPIRIT moved out near the nine-sixteenths, settled on the outside,
was asked while three then four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. FLEETFOOTED broke in at the start, was taken in hand early then reserved off the
pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
ROMAN GODDESS established the front near the six furlong marker and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside into the turn and dueled
with DASHING DELLA as that rival advanced outside to engage for the front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch
and edged clear under a drive to prevail. GHOSTLY GIRL chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into
upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. DASHING DELLA chased just off the pace four wide down the backstretch, advanced at the half mile pole
and tucked to the two path into the turn getting on near even terms and knocking heads for command through the bend coming under coaxing nearing the
quarter pole, swung three wide for home, dug in under a drive shaken off a furlong out, weakened in the late stages while safe for the show honors.
HARLAN'S BOND six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
tipped six wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish to secure the last major share. MY GIRL JAL chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered no response. SHIGEKO coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. DIVINE CROSS chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. SUSIE'S SAVER
chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, made no impact.
YOGI coaxed from the gate, flashed brief speed three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn and retreated under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
OUR COUNTRY was reserved in the back half of the field on the inside, rounded the far turn under a bit of extra left-rein guidance, was roused while
swinging four wide into upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late and prevail. GHOSTLYPRINCE was well placed
just off the pace in the two to three path, gained to make a bid into upper stretch, dueled with COVERT KAT into the final sixteenth, bested that rival for the
place but was caught by the winner. COVERT KAT disputed the pace on the outside in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a
drive, dueled inside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the show. KHAFRE was rated on the inside, moved to the
two path late on the far turn, was asked near the three-sixteenths, chased under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. SPACE LAUNCH traveled
around the opening bend in the two path, settled in the middle of the field, was roused four then five wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response.
EDDIE THE GREAT was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, saved ground near the back, moved to the two path late on the far turn, angled out
in upper stretch and failed to threaten. HE'S GOT IT went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused three wide on the far turn, came
five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. SPETTRO was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the inside, was asked early on the far turn, dropped
back into upper stretch and tired. MY ROMEO LIMA stumbled at the start then was taken in hand early, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved
towards the back, moved from the two path to the four path while asked on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. ARRIO went three
to four wide on the first turn, moved up early on the backstretch, stalked the pace on the outside, chased three then four wide on the far turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
SUPERS LUCKY LADY got bumped at the start by VOLEUSE breaking outwards and then got bumped by SHAMAN PRINCESS coming inwards, pressed
that rival along the inside early on before easing off to give chase through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into
upper stretch, tipped out to the two path near the eighth pole, rallied to steadily wear down the leader to get up in the final jumps and prevail. SHAMAN
PRINCESS broke in at the start bumping the aforementioned foe, cut the pace just off the inside under some pressure early before being clear and safe
through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and was caught in the final strides to the finish.
VOLEUSE broke out at the start bumping and carrying out a foe while squeezing back another, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and closed well to secure the show honors. LAURANA chased four to five paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. CERRETTA
chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. SHE'S A NATURAL got taken
in hand when squeezed out at the start conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three
to four wide for home and was outkicked. SHOWEMYOURHEELS chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route
into upper stretch, weakened. CHERBOURG chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch,
tired. TRUE MARTINI chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the turn, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. ARMY OF THOUGHTS chased two to three wide until tucked inside near the
seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.
