Footnotes
SPEEDY BUBBLES took command from the start, was unchallenged looking for company through the turn, opened up in mid-stretch when coaxed and
cruised home comfortably at the wire. SOUPER COP travelled in midfield in the two path down the backside, was hard ridden keeping position between
horses with five sixteenths to go and rallied with rivals on each side late to close in to be a distant second at the finish. MY ASSISTANT tracked the top two
down the backstretch, came under a vigorous ride on the rail at the quarter pole, chased the winner in vain at the top of the lane but to no avail by
mid-stretch and faded in the final sixteenth to hold for show. CLASSICALCROSSOVER had a slow start to trail down the backside, began to pick up runners
outside midpoint on the turn and finished with interest up the fence down the lane for a minor role in the end. SWEEPING PASSION travelled in midpack
three deep outside of rivals down the backside, was urged three wide midway on the turn, could not keep pace with closing rivals on either side turning for
home, was in tight quarters in the five path at the furlong marker and could not offer a finish. KALOMA veered in at the start, settled on the rail close to the
back in the early going, made on early move advancing on the fence at the half for better position, was shuffled back inside to trail the field on the turn and
could not get involved in the stretch run. TATOOSONMYSOUL stalked near the back of the pack outside three deep down the back straight, made a mild
run three wide around foes at the quarter pole to be in the conversation for a minor share in the six path straightening out for the drive, could not sustain the
run and stalled in the final sixteenth. POLA STAR watched the winner, just sitting behind down the backside, continued to chase but to no avail on the turn,
stopped abruptly, losing action at the eight pole drifting inwards and was eased crossing the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
KRYPTO GAINS broke a half-step slowly, gained forward position tracking in behind the pace, put to urging outside the quarter pole while shifting out past
that marker, came sweeping to the lead four wide in upper stretch, moved clear, drifted out just a bit but held sway while being kept to the task. FEDALINE
broke outwardly bumping a rival, stalked the pace into the turn, was always within striking distance racing three to four wide on the turn, moved out a bit in
the stretch and kept on evenly but was only second best. WANT TO GO DANCING pressed the early pace, continued to chase two to three wide, dropped
back when in a bit tight past the seven-sixteenths, came again in the stretch but missed second. ROSES ARE FREE set the pace inside, weakened through
the final furlong. GENTLE SEAS bumped the outer rival at the start, fanned out from four to six wide on the turn, needed more. LULU'S LULLABY chased
from mid-pack going about four wide on the turn, lacked a late bid. SAKE AND SUSHI was bumped at the start, briefly chased into the turn, dropped back
three wide on that bend, faded. MAGNETIZE broke a step slowly and was bumped and bothered, raced near the inside off the pace, was never a threat.
CLASSIC GLORY was bumped lightly into a rival at the start, failed to menace.

Footnotes
EMERANCE broke outwards at the start, assumed command setting a modest pace down the backside, dictated terms while hounded outside throughout
the turn, spurted clear when asked at the furlong marker and had something left to hold off the closing stablemates at the wire. CREVALLE D'ORO travelled
between runners in the third flight in the beginning, was nudged taking closer order between horses with three eighths remaining, posed a threat four wide
for the stretch run and stubbornly never gave in, chasing the winner to the finish. WHY EM SEA AY stalked outside in the third flight, was unhurried, waiting
to pounce through the turn, made a sharp move bursting between foes at the quarter pole looming in the five path turning for home and determinedly battled
to the wire just being outgamed in deep stretch. MORE MONEY HUNNY was bumped inside at the break, rated kindly in hand watching the frontrunning
winner down the back straight, pressed the pace taking closer order outside running on the turn, in the hunt three path between turning for home but was
one paced in the stretch to settle on the fringes. QUALITY PRESENCE stalked in the third flight on the fence, was in good position nestled on the rail
watching the winner on the turn, had a chance inside straightening out for the drive to the wire but lacked a closing response to the finish line. BRAVO KATE
was allowed to settle trailing the field down the backside, saved ground but could not make any headway running on the turn and had little to show driving to
the finish. INITTOWINIT was eager early on prompting three wide outside down the backstretch, could not keep up with others travelling four wide outside
foes through the turn, was fanned out to the six path for the drive and emptied out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
NIKKI NOOTS bumped the inside rival lightly at the start, raced off the loose leaders while off the fence and in the clear, advanced on that one taking the
lead outside the four- and one-half, moved clear on the turn, extended the margin in the stretch while being kept to the task. BET N WIN settled inside rivals
mid-pack but off the fence, was encouraged along coming to the seven-sixteenths, went two to three wide on the far turn, held place in late stretch.
ANSELMO was bumped at the start, settled off the pace inside early, advanced two to three wide on the far turn, swung out five deep on that bend still
advancing but could not sustain the effort nor get past a rival for second. STRONGER TOGETHER was urged strongly from the break to make the lead and
move several lengths clear, shifted in on the first turn setting the tempo from inside, was overtaken late up the backstretch, had no extra but held a minor
award. COACH ABERNATHY settled between runners three wide through the early going, angled in at the quarter pole rather than going around foes, ran
on in the stretch but needed more. GOOD SOLDIER was caught outside foes mid-pack into the first turn, settled racing four wide, continued four to five
deep on the far turn, failed to rally and kicked on evenly. GLENHOLME was unhurried at the back, moved out and went four to five wide and outside rivals
on the far turn, was never near enough to threaten. PERFECT PLAY raced toward the back off the inside and was not a factor. DEFOGGER was two wide
and between foes about mid-pack early, faded.

Footnotes
RED ELEANOR broke out to begin, was checked mildly losing his lane leaving the chute, had a good inside position watching the contesting pair down the
backside, advanced on the rail with three furlongs to go, shifted outside three wide for the drive gaining momentum and wore down the frontrunning pair in
the final sixteenth to edge away for the victory crossing the line. NOVEL battled on the rail down the backside, had a slim advantage while being pressed
outside on the turn, put away the early speed foe in mid-stretch running on the rail, courageously dug in trying to fend off the winner who had an ideal
tracking trip and bested the rest in the end. SAUCY NAME was eager in the beginning setting the pace outside, dueled two wide down the backstretch for
the lead, continued to press the issue up front on the turn, was the first of the early speed pair to give way between horses at the furlong marker and was
weakening at the wire but comfortably held for show at the finish. TEXENSIS was void of early speed trailing down the backstretch, saved ground picking up
runners midway on the turn, continued to show some late energy on the fence turning for home and finished up for a minor role in the end. POWAQA was
alone stalking in the third flight down the back straight, came under a hard ride making no impression throughout the turn and could not get interested inside
driving to the finish. BLUE TANGO was pushed out on the break, had a good position tracking the front engaging pair outside in the second flight down the
backside, was scrubbed on trying to match strides with the rallying winner inside three furlongs from home, could not quicken and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
LUCYS CHILD was lightly bumped at the start, chased mostly two to three wide racing between runners early and inside foes into the turn, put to urging
midway on that bend, gradually gained on the leader in a prolonged drive striking the lead a sixteenth out and kicking away. LAKE SHORE DRIVE was
coaxed clear soon after the start, set the tempo on the front-end, extended the advantage early and midway on the turn, beg. SNOOKERED bumped the
outer rival at the start, settled in behind runners racing between foes into the turn, fanned out leaving that bend coming to the top of the stretch four to five
wide, ran on to secure show. GUNGI chased from outside early going four then five wide through the turn, needed more. STUBBORN STREAK was
bumped reasonably hard by the inside foe and lightly into the outside rival at the start, settled outside at the back, fanned out widest from four to six wide on
the turn, needed more in the lane. WILD CONVERSATION chased from inside on or just off the rail, dropped back after the half-mile marker, tired late while
drifting out nearing the wire. UNEXPECTED OUTCOME (IRE) chased from between runners going three wide on the turn, faded.
