ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled four wide for racing room and evened out. RICHARD HOOTY unhurried,
saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and improved position. STRICTLY CONFIDENT hopped at the start, was
unhurried early, moved up three wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. NIGHT RIDE stalked the pace on the
outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and had no rally. AMERICA'S GUEST mid pack, faded after

Footnotes
GET NONE unhurried, looped up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off late. UP IN ARMS allowed
to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the place. WILD LOOKER mid
pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled four wide, made a steady gain and edged up for the
show in the final strides. CINCO DE MANDEE stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the
stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then weakened. LAWN DART set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into
the stretch, then weakened the final furlong. WATERLOO SUNSET well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn, then faded into the
stretch. LUCKY DAY DIVA was a brief factor, outside.
