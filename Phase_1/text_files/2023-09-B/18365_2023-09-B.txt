Footnotes
SHINING TIGER was a bit slow into stride away from the gate, rushed up approaching the half-mile marker and assumed a good stalking position while
outside of rivals heading into the turn, loomed four wide at the quarter marker and took command into upper stretch, drew to a clear lead under firm urging
into the final furlong and was kept to task to the finsh. COME OUT FIGHTING was a bit fractious in the post parade, was away in good order and raced
close to the early pace, took back and settled while saving ground into the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, improved position at the furlong
grounds, rallied in deep stretch and could not impact the winner in the final stages but was best of the rest. JOEY BRACKETS lacked early speed, was
guided two wide into the turn, swung five wide into the stretch drive, improved position at the furlong marker, continued his steady bid into the final sixteenth
and held safely for third at the finish. IM GUNNA broke alertly, vied for the early lead while four deep in the early running, took back to press the pace while
three wide along the turn, lost position into the stretch and flattened out in the late stages. DAD'S JUBILEE was sent to establish the early lead, disputed the
decent pace with NO SHOW JONES through the turn, was overtaken by SHINING TIGER in upper stretch, chased the winner to the furlong grounds and
tired in deep stretch. PRECEDENT LUKE was prominent in the early running and vied for the early lead while three wide and between runners, took back
into the turn and chased from the inside heading to the quarter marker, came in tight and was blocked approaching the furlong marker, lacked racing room
heading to the sixteenth marker, found room in deep stretch and did not offer a late response. NO SHOW JONES showed speed in the early stages, vied for
the early lead while two wide and between runners into the turn, pressed the moderate pace to the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and faded
late.

Footnotes
WELLSWORT (IRE) came away well, was a bit keen going into the first turn but settled into a tracking position in the two path down the backstretch, went to
engage with the leader approaching the quarter pole, pulled even at the top of the stretch while still well in hand, responded when roused and pulled away.
EFFECTIVE GIG broke well then was hustled to the front, attempted to slow down the pace through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, shrugged
off a couple of bids from LOVE OF THE SPORT, then quickened away passing the three furlong marker, was challenged on the outside by WELLSWORT
(IRE) at the quarter, could not match strides with that one but held the place. UNUSUAL CODE was not asked for speed from the break, lagged at the rear
of the field to the far turn while never far back, began to rally through the second turn, sustained that bid three wide into the stretch and finished up well to
gain third. EL JOY outrun to the first turn then was in tight and a little hard to place through that turn, was still keen behind horses for the entirety of the
backstretch run, steadied in traffic near between poles on the far turn, came into the stretch behind horses then got clear much too late. LOVE OF THE
SPORT encouraged from the break then was content to stalk EFFECTIVE GIG in the two path, made a couple or runs at that one to push the pace but was
rebuffed, struggled to keep up when that foe quickened away with three furlongs to go, weakened and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
ALEXANDER'S DREAM was prominent in the early running, took back off of the fast early pace and tracked from the inside approaching the turn, gained
ground nearing the quarter marker then took command in upper stretch while in hand, was set down at the furlong pole, was kept to steady urging into deep
stretch and inched away while under a drive in the final stages. THE LITTLE H MAN was forwardly placed in the opening stages, rated off of the quick early
pace and settled outside of a rival heading to the half-mile marker, gained ground on the turn while two wide, came three wide into the stretch, chased
ALEXANDER'S DREAM to mid-stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner into deep stretch and was outkicked, while
besting the rest. BLAZING JAMIE broke a step slowly away from the gate and settled off of the fast early pace, saved ground into the turn, tipped two wide
in upper stretch and offered a bid at the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the top pair in deep stretch and was outfinished, while well clear of the rest
for third. OUR BOLD PRINCE was asked for speed leaving the break, engaged with RUNKERRY and disputed solid early fractions with that rival while off of
the rail, carved out a fast pace along the turn, drifted out nearing the quarter marker and in the process floated out RUNKERRY, continued to drift out into
upper stretch, lost the lead to ALEXANDER'S DREAM at the three-sixteenths and tired in the stretch run. RUNKERRY broke alertly, engaged with OUR
BOLD PRINCE in the opening furlong and contested solid fractions into the turn, kept attendance to OUR BOLD PRINCE into the bend, was floated out by
that rival heading to the quarter marker and lost ground while four wide nearing the top of the lane, chased the leaders to mid-stretch and lacked a late
response. COUNTING CARDS was fractious in the gate, tracked the fast early pace from the second flight, was outrun approaching the quarter marker and
gave way in the stretch.

SHANGHAI MIST broke sharply then inherited the early lead when uncontested, set reasonable fractions throughout, responded when roused a the top of
the stretch and held clear under intermittent urging. NAVY QUEEN broke alertly then taken in hand, was content to let the pace scenario play out while
racing mid-pack to the half, then eased into contention up the rail, had to wait for racing room through the turn, tipped out a path in the stretch, had a little
trouble changing leads and could not reel in the winner. LIAM'S SECRET stalked the pace three deep to the far turn, moved to challenge passing the
quarter pole, went three wide into the stretch, could not keep pace with the top two in the final furlong and was well clear of the rest for third. RIVIERA
SUNRISE hopped at the start, spotting the field a head start, chased the field from well behind and was never a factor. STATEFOREST stalked the pace set
by SHANGHAI MIST while racing in the two path to the far turn, bid approaching the quarter pole in tandem with LIAM'S SECRET to to the outside then
struggled to keep up and was outrun down the stretch.

Footnotes
TOUR QUEEN was asked to show speed away from the start, vied with STREET TIGER in the early stages then took command and set a quick pace from
the inside into the turn, showed the way to the quarter marker while well handled, drew to a clear lead while in hand into upper stretch, was kept to task
under steady urging to the sixteenth-marker and held safely at the finish to prevail in an impressive debut. BROADWAY TIGER was forwardly placed
leaving the start, advanced between rivals heading to the half-mile marker and pressed the pace while three wide on the run into the turn, chased three wide
along the bend and improved position approaching the quarter pole, lost ground to TOUR QUEEN into upper stretch and chased into the final sixteenth, was
able to close into the winner's margin in the late stages but could not reel that one in and was second best at the finish. LAST ELIZABETHAN exchanged
bumps with a neighboring rival at the break and was off a bit slowly, settled off of the fast early pace and saved ground into the turn, improved position
approaching the quarter marker, saved all of the ground into upper stretch and advanced at the furlong marker, was not able to impact the top two in deep
stretch but was gaining in the final stages and held for third. STAY UP settled in the second flight early on, raced outside of rivals into the turn then angled to
the three path nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, offered a late bid in deep stretch and just missed for third at the finish.
PONDERGATING chased the quick early pace, ran in pursuit while two wide on the turn, lost ground into the stretch and lacked a late rally. JUSTIVAR
hesitated at the start and was off slowly, gave chase while trailing into the turn, saved ground into upper stretch, improved position in the final furlong but did
not threaten. SUSIE CRU traded bumps at the start with LAST ELIZABETHAN, chased the solid early pace while three while and between runners, checked
while in tight quarters approaching the three-eighths marker, was steered to the four path into upper stretch and did not factor in the late stages. CANDY
LITZ tracked from the second flight in the early running, raced two wide along the turn and did not threaten in the stretch. SILVER MATY broke alertly,
chased the fast early pace while outside of rivals, advanced heading to the quarter marker and pressed the pace while four wide heading into the turn, ran in
pursuit while four wide nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. STREET TIGER was prominent
leaving the start and contested the fast early pace with TOUR QUEEN, conceded the lead and stalked that rival into the turn, kept attendance to the quick
pace while two wide along the bend, dropped back approaching the top of the stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
DRESS REHEARSAL kept close up by the rider but behind the speed duel, took the two path through the turn as the leading pack sorted themselves out,
swung out into the clear and produced a furious rally down the stretch to win going away. TURA LURA was inside the four horse scramble for the early lead,
dropped off the pace passing the three furlong marker, remained to the inside and got stuck behind horses when trying to re-bid down the stretch, finally got
room to swing to the outside well past the eighth pole and rallied to get the place. SWIFT NONNI broke well and joined the early pace battle on the outside,
backed off a bit through the turn then re-rallied three wide into the stretch, was about to take the lead in mid-stretch but was outfinished by the top two.
TORREY'S GIRL broke well and raced in the three path with the group contesting the early pace, forged ahead inside of BACALAR through the turn, battled
gamely through the stretch and weakened late. BLUSHING BAY was outrun and raced well behind the field in the early going, made a sweeping rally wide
on the turn and carried the run into the stretch, made up some ground but was still unable to pose a threat. BACALAR took a slight lead between horses as
part of the quartet dueling through the first quarter mile, pulled ahead of the rest through the turn with TORREY'S GIRL matching strides to the inside,
battled that foe to mid-stretch then weakened in the final furlong.

TAMARA MINE was hard to load prior to the start, was away in good order and was forwardly placed in the early running, took command and set quick
fractions while pressured into the turn, carved out the fast pace from the inside while pressed to the quarter marker by BIG SIS LITTLE SIS, shook free of
that rival into upper stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong pole, drew off in the late stages and was ridden out to the finish to be much the best. BIG SIS
LITTLE SIS showed speed away from the start, was prominent in the early running and pressed the fast pace while two wide and between runners heading
into the turn, kept close attendance to TAMARA MINE approaching the quarter marker, lost ground to that rival into the stretch, was no match for the winner
in the final furlong and ran on to be second best. LADY'S SERMON lacked early speed and raced in the two path into the turn, was roused leaving the three
furlong marker and swung six wide for the drive, made a mild gain at mid-stretch, responded to urging inside of the furlong marker, offered a late bid in deep
stretch and was up in the final strides to secure third. SWALL lunged at the start and was off slowly, chased the fast early pace and was steered outside of
rivals approaching the half-mile marker, raced widest into the turn and improved position nearing the quarter marker, came five wide into the stretch, lost
ground at the furlong marker, finished evenly in deep stretch and just missed for third at the finish. CITY GLITTER took back off of the fast early pace, saved
ground into the turn, was steered three wide into the stretch and improved position at the furlong marker, could not keep pace into deep stretch and
weakened. LADY WOLF broke alertly and contested the fast early pace, pressed the pace while three deep into the turn, lost position along along the turn
and chased to the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch and gave way. PAPPY'S GIRL was asked for speed leaving the start and chased the fast
early pace while outside of rivals, came three then four wide along the turn and gained ground approaching the quarter marker, could not sustain that run
into the stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
TOWN PERFORMER broke out at the start and bothered EASTER TRIBUTE in the initial strides, straightened then chased RESERVE PROOF to the
stretch, bid from the three-eighths marker, loomed but had trouble getting past that stubborn foe for the length of the stretch, kept to task into the final
sixteenth, vied between rivals into deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. PASS THE BATON broke inward after an awkward start, putting
EASTER TRIBUTE in tight, worked over to the rail before the turn, responded to strong handling on the turn, tipped out to the four path into the stretch,
rallied strongly down the middle of the course and just missed. RESERVE PROOF hustled from the break, gained the lead passing the five-eighths pole,
held clear through the turn, opened up in the stretch, ran on well but could not hold off the top two in the final yards. EASTER TRIBUTE got pinched back
after the break, gave the field a head start but made a steady forward progress to get into contention by the stretch then found best stride in the late stages
and was gaining in the final yards. ZEE CARROT EAGLE got away from the gate in good order, settled into a stalking position, angled to the rail for the run
through the turn, got clear run into the stretch and made a mild late bid. MAVERICK ROSE broke best, veered into the path of FINCAIRN right after the
break then rushed to take the lead in the early stages, dropped back to a stalking position, was put into a drive from the three-eighths marker, came into the
stretch four wide, loomed a threat in mid-stretch but did not sustain the bid. ST BOADIN outrun from the break, chased the field from far behind to the turn,
saved ground, kept to task and passed a couple in the late stages. GALLO DEL CIELO broke well was raced closed to the pace for the first quarter mile,
began to lose ground before the turn, was put into a drive before the three eighths pole and was unable to improve position. FINCAIRN broke a beat slow
then showed no early speed, struggled to keep up and chased the field throughout.
