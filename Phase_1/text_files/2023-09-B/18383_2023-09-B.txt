Footnotes
KAPHAVATA rallied on the turn bidding four deep down the lane getting a nose down on the wire. BORN FOR VICTORY pressured the pace dueling
between horses down the lane just missing. ROCKIN MACHEN set the pace being hooked on the turn battling inside of rivals to the wire. CHOCO ROCO
raced evenly through the turn moving six wide down the lane edging closer late. THE FIVE B'S chased the pace saving ground to upper stretch hanging late
along the rail. SEAN THE HAMMER raced evenly to upper stretch weakening late. CUPID'S NUMBER faded on the turn. CATCHING MAGIC played no
factor. FIFTEEN TO VEGAS was always outrun. FROSTED WHITE FACE was never involved.
