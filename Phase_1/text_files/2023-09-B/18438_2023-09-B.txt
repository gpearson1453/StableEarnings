Footnotes
ELI'S GIRL vied for the lead around the first turn, continued to match strides up the backstretch, shook off RIGHT OF REFUSAL but remained under
pressure from SASSY AINT I, turned back bid at the head of the lane, responded willingly when called upon and pulled away. SASSY AIN'T I pressed the
pace three wide around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued in striking distance of eventual winner around the far turn, was no match for rival in
upper stretch but stayed on with response and finished clearly second best. I GOT A NAME was keen along the rail around the first turn and continued to
tug wanting to do more while stuck inside up the backstretch, hustled up two wide around the far turn but failed to gain on the leaders, ran on three wide
through the lane and cleared a share. CAYMAN QUEEN raced two wide just off the top trio through early stages, lost ground on the top pair around the far
turn, came two to three wide into the lane and had no response. RIGHT OF REFUSAL dueled outside of the eventual winner around the first turn and up the
backstretch, came up empty entering the far turn and steadily retreated.

TWIRLING CHIEF rated just off the top flight in the opening quarter, crept up closer late on the turn, given cue three wide at the head of the lane, cleared
the lead a furlong out and held firm. ACCELERITAS tracked the top pair in early stages, continued in close range around the turn, given cue two wide

briefly before steadily picking up the pace along the outside, moved up into range around the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, stayed on with
response and secured a share. DAY MONEY raced off the early pace, hustled along three wide around the turn, came out wider for the drive and had a mild
improve. SOLE SURVIVOR was unhurried in early stages, picked up the pace two wide late on the turn, moved into range upper stretch then flattened out.
LET'S ROCK N ROLL set a pressured pace up the backstretch, continued to hold a slim lead around the turn, got collared upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
ALMA'S PRINCESS rated inside off the pace in early stages, gained ground along the rail around the turn, moved up the inside to engage rivals for the lead
approaching the furlong marker, dug in gamely, edged away and held clear. CANARY NATION settled just off the early pace made a three wide move
around the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and finished with good response. AUNT LOTTIE set the pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead
around the turn, battled on past the eighth pole then flattened late. KENZIE LOU tracked the early pace then moved up to engage AUNT LOTTIE for the
lead three furlongs from home, battled on between rivals a furlong out then gave way grudgingly in late stages. FLAT OUT HOT was forwardly placed in the
opening quarter, chased two wide around the turn then flattened in the lane. EXTESSA moved to the outside soon after the start, raced off the pace, came
five wide into upper stretch and never threatened. BEACH BABY broke sharp then conceded position position but remined in contention up the backstretch,
could not sustain bid around the turn and steadily weakened. CAT GOT LUCKY was off very awkwardly at the start and raced in the back, chased three
wide into upper stretch then retreated.
