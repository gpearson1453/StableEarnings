Footnotes
FREYDIS set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the turn, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. OPHELIAS DREAM unhurried,
moved up on the two path through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and closed well for the place. SHE'S GOT RHYTHM moved up quickly to gain
position into the turn, held that position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then drifted in and weakened late.
GEARED UP allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals for a share. CEREAL I
D rated tracking the pace, held position through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and had no rally. HOPE SHE COMES rated back
early, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and had no rally. ASHERAH'S RUN steadied along in the early going,
was no factor.

Footnotes
ROUND OF APPLAUSE allowed to settle, moved up between rivals, steadied for racing room angling in saving ground through the second turn, was
blocked, waited, got mid way of the turn, came through inside into the stretch, angled out, made a steady gain and edged up late. CONRADO sprinted away
from the field early, increased his margin down the backstretch, then was caught late, and was clearly best of the rest. NIP OF BOURBON steadied into the
first turn, was well placed inside, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for
the show. JUST PRAISE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed the show.
GLORIOUS TRIBUTE well placed and outside, gained position three and four wide through the second turn, came widest into the stretch and flattened out.
GRAVE DANGER well placed and between, lost some ground two and three wide through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. BRYTON'S D J was
no factor.

JARETH unhurried, gained position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off late. SOUTH SEA
unhurried, moved up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and closed well for the place. BIG CHICKEN MAN sprinted to a
clear lead soon after the start, drew off through the turn, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. LONTANI well placed and inside, held position
on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and flattened out the final furlong. POLLOCK unhurried, moved up and steadied for
racing room mid way of the turn, came through on the two path into the stretch, angled widest and improved position. HEATHER'S GOLD was a brief factor.
KING ECLIPTICAL tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and had no rally.

VELOCE tracked the pace back, moved up inside through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and flattened
the final furlong. BARNEGAT LIGHT allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and
weakened the final furlong. MAXIMUM IMPACT was no factor. DR. STEVE stalked the pace on the outside, collard the leader and bid outside of that one
into the stretch, then had no rallyt.

Footnotes
SOUL OF THE BEAST broke sharply from the gate and sprinted clear quickly, held sway without challenge, drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task.
ITALIAN TWIN bore out in the early going, gained position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and closed well for the place.
WREAKING HAVOC pulled to contention, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, weakened late and held the show.
ORGANZA allowed to settle, looped up four and five wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and edged up for a share. READY SHE IS
unhurried, moved up on the two path through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and improved position. STORMIN MELLY allowed to settle, saved
ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and passed tiring rivals. ABUNDANT STORY well placed and
inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. SAINT FOXY mid pack and inside,
saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and faded. NOT SHY was never involved. CONNECTING FLIGHT well placed and
outside, faded on the two path through the turn.
