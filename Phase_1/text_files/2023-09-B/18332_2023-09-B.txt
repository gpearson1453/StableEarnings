Footnotes
DANZIG UP A STORM saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn and shook clear in the final
furlong. BRI raced in the two path early, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the far bend and kept on to
the finish. MUMBLEBEE raced in the three path around the first bend, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far bend still in the
three path and improved position late. GEORGIANO raced in the four path early, stalked the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, came around
the second turn in the three path and showed no kick. STAYTHIRSTYMYAMIGO trailed the field from the two path through the opening half mile, saved
ground around the far bend and was not a threat. AWESOME SUNSET was acting up when the gates opened, causing her gate to open late, lost her rider
in the process and was caught and walked off.

Footnotes
CRYSTAL CRESCENT raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and
gained ground to get up for the win late. THINKITASADONATION dueled between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the
two path around the turn, and dug in in the lane but was caught in the final strides. WICKED STREET tracked the pace setters on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the bend from the two path and weakened in the final furlong. OKIE FRONT raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the
opening stages, came around the turn in the two path and finished evenly. GO GO GO raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch,
continued around the turn in the three path and showed no kick. PROUD VALENTINE dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while
saving ground around the turn and tired entering the stretch. SHELL GAME raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the early going,
navigated the bend from the three path and was empty from there. GIRONA raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in
the four path and made no bid. HOPE AND A DREAM trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was never a factor.
