RHYTHMIC RULER sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace off the rail, drifted out to the five path entering the stretch, was put to right handed
urging near the furlong marker, the rider switched to a left handed crop in near the sixteenth pole striking his mount once, drifted out to the eight path
through the final stages and won under a hand ride. MR LOOOCH bore in at the start bumping RAISE THE PURSE causing a chain reaction of bumping to
his inside, stalked the pace three wide into the turn, drew closer outside the winner, was carried out to the six path at the top of the stretch then to mid track
through the final sixteenth of a mile and finished well clear for second while being checked. SUSIE'S KID altered course sharply to the outside at the start
and passed tiring rivals outside. RAISE THE PURSES was bumped between horses at the start and failed to menace. O CIGANO also bumped between
rivals at the start, pressed the pace two wide and was through after a half. GARRETT was brushed at the start and had brief speed. THE STEWARDS
POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF MR LOOOCH LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, ALSO, THE RIDER OF RAISE THE PURSES LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MR LOOOCH

FAIR AND SQUARE broke in front, set all the pace while nicely rated and prevailed under strong handling. SILENCE unhurried early, closed willingly three
wide and finished second best. RAISON KARTER chased the winner two wide and went evenly. SHELL FIRE failed to menace. TO WIN was no factor.
RELISH THE RIDE under a strong hold along the inside early, weakened in the stretch.
