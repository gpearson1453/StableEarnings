TAP ON BY led the way up the backstretch and held firm around the turn, saved ground turning for home, roused for more upper stretch, responded
willingly, turned back the bid from MADETHEDEANSLIST and pulled away. MADETHEDEAN'SLIST raced up close in early stages, was ridden two wide in
striking distance around the turn, failed to be a match with pulling away winner in the lane, kept on and held place. COUNTY JAIL raced outside in the last
flight, hustled up three to four wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid through the lane and just missed place. ROCKIN BOOTS raced off the early
pace, hustled up around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch and improved position without threatening. RULING THE ROOST got squeezed a bit
between rivals at the start, raced in the last flight, saved ground and lacked a needed rally. CLIMB TO GLORY chased in contention through early stages,
flattened late on the turn and continued to tire in the drive. IOWA FARMGIRL chased in range through early stages then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
OUR LAST CHANCE set the pace up the backstretch then took on the challenge of MOLLIES ROCKET at the quarter pole, dueled inside through the lane,
maintained a slight edge over rival then dug in gamely and edged away. MOLLIES ROCKET tracked the early pace, moved up three wide to duel for the
lead at the quarter pole, battled outside of OUR LAST CHANT through the lane, fought gamely but could not kick on with the winner late.
REDNECKERTHANYOU was forwardly placed up the backstretch, urged two wide in close contention around the turn, weakened off the embattled pair in
the lane but stayed on for a share. SECRET BLARNEY raced off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. LATE FOR
LUNCH tracked the early pace, coaxed two to three wide around the turn then gave way. JAYSKER saved ground and failed to respond when called upon.
AMERICAN POSSE dwelt at the start and raced in or near the back throughout.

Footnotes
GLENGARRY broke sharp, quickly cleared and crossed over to the inside soon after the start, set the pace up the backstretch and held firm around the turn,
saved ground turning for home and drew off willingly under a hand ride. DAWSON'S STORM raced off the pace inside in the opening quarter, quickly
gained closer contention around the turn, sustained bid through the lane and cleared second best. TEE OFF TIME rated off the early pace, hustled up
between rivals late on the backstretch, cut the corner entering the lane, sustained a steady bid and gained show. FREEDOM TO SPEED tracked the pace
up the backstretch, coaxed two wide around then turn then weakened in the lane. SPECIALSORTASTORM raced up close along the rail in opening stages
then got in tight on the rail and checked repeatedly through the backstretch, lost all momentum, dropped back and failed to regain. SURPRISE ROAD TRIP
raced in the last flight in early stages, hustled up three wide around the turn, came four wide into upper stretch and faded. NAVE showed brief speed two
wide then retreated.

SIR WALLY WALLY angled in and took over the lead heading into the first turn, set quick fractions on top up the backstretch, continued to control the quick
tempo and widened advantage around the far turn, saved ground entering the lane, pulled away a furlong out then kept clear under a mild drive. FINISH UP
reared in the air at the start and lost ground, continued unhurried and well off the pace up the backstretch, swung four wide into upper stretch and rallied
gamely to clear second best. MINECRAFT MANIAC rated off the speedy top trio up the backstretch, picked up the pace around the far turn, came four wide
into upper stretch then angled in and secured show. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY was well reserved racing in the back, swung wide into the stretch and
improved position. BIG PINES SANDY rated off the quick speed in early stages, chased two to three wide around the far turn and lacked a needed rally.
RUNNING ALEX'SBAND raced off the pace, saved ground and failed to threaten. SMART N INTUITIVE stalked the quick leader up the backstretch, chased
rival around the far turn and faded in the lane. TIME GOES ON steadied heading into the first turn, raced just off the quick pace setter up the backstretch,
chased rival around the turn then retreated in the lane. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY AND RIDER OF TIME GOES ON CLAIMED FOUL

continued well off the pace into the far turn, given cue in upper stretch, responded gamely, rallied along the outside and just missed.
WILDATLANTICSTORM raced up close around the first turn and into the backstretch, moved up at the half mile marker, vied with rival then shook free
midway around the far turn, widened to a clear advantage then got caught in closing strides. WARREN L settled through early stages then moved up into
closer contention around the far turn, sustained bid into the lane then weakened late. PALACE GUARD rated just off the early pace, swung four wide into
upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. C R INSTA GATOR raced up close around the first turn, vied up the backstretch and to the midway point around
the far turn then gave way. LAWLESS JOHN led the way around the first turn, vied up the backstretch then retreated on the far turn. STUMPY'S LOVE

MISS PEACH settled and saved ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, made a move three wide mid-way around the far turn, took over the
lead at the head of the lane and finished clear. JUST LIKE TRISTA tracked the pace through early stages, saved ground around the far turn, tipped two to
three wide for the drive, set down two wide a furlong out and cleared second best. INTERSTELLA stalked the pace while tugging a bit in early stages,
moved up to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, ran on into the final furlong then flattened out. FLAT OUT STORMIN rated just off the pace in early
stages, hustled up four wide into upper stretch and needed more for serious impact. ANGEL'S MELODY set the pace, got collared past the quarter pole and
tired in the drive. KAYLA raced off the pace, came three to four wide entering upper stretch and had no response. RAINBOW DASH raced off the pace, was
ridden two to three wide late on the far turn and failed to move into contention. OLIVE OYL raced three wide around the first turn, raced off the early pace

Footnotes
GOLD TAPPER dueled two wide for the early lead and continued to match strides into the turn, battled on into the lane, dueled outside of FREDDY J, dug in
gamely and prevailed. FREDDY J tracked the early pace, gained ground on the rail around the turn, moved up to challenge for the lead in upper stretch,
dueled gamely inside of GOLD TAPPER and just missed. ANNUAL BUDGET raced up close four wide through early stages, swung five wide into upper
stretch, sustained a steady bid and gained show. DOT COM DREAMIN raced in range along the inside, launched a three wide bid at the quarter pole, ran
on into the lane then evened out late. NATIVE HELLRAISER raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, angled out upper stretch and lacked a
needed rally. LEAPIN TY MAN raced off the early speed, hustled along three to four wide out of the turn and failed to kick on. FLEET OF HOOF dueled
inside for the early lead, battled on around the turn then tired in the drive. WELLER ROGUE raced in the back and failed to gain close range. UNCLE
SINGH raced up close three wide in the backstretch, chased four wide around the turn then faded. SANGRIA SKY showed response in the opening stages
then steadily faded.
