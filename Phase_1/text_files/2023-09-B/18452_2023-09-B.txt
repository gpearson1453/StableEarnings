Footnotes
CAPTAIN CREED broke outward and made contact with Fairpit then gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path, drifted into the lane but dug in and
dueled LONG LEGS through later yards for the win. The latter set the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole and contested the
edge nearest the rail on the turn, was steadily handled leaving the turn but reluctantly ceded later yards. GOLDEN ADAGE was bumped at the break then
gave chase, raced two deep on the turn then flattened toward mid-stretch. FAIRPIT was bumped outward and into Golden Adage leaving the gate and
never factored.

GHOST OF ALCINA chased through the backstretch and raced close off the rail on the turn, was carried out leaving the turn but dug in for the lead
mid-stretch and held on with steady encouragement. MISS ARGENTINA gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path, drifted leaving the turn but
finished well to take second later yards and was gaining on the winner. CAJUN CASHEW drew clear and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under
pressure toward the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the turn but drifted into the lane, was met toward mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. LIL
SPITTIN IMAGE chased outside, raced near the rail on the turn and weakened. VERITAS LUX MEA came away a step slow and never factored.
