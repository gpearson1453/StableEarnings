Footnotes
SMOOTHDINI broke slowly, laid off of the pace in the three to four path into the turn, spun to the five path entering the lane, rallied to close in on the tiring
leader in the final sixteenth and forged an advantage nearing the wire. TAPITBOY set the pace in the two path, bore to the three path approaching the three
furlong pole but responded well to being shown right handed crop and showed the way in the two path turning for home, drove clear in upper stretch, but
tired entering the final sixteenth and got nailed at the wire. METRONOME tracked along the inside, tipped outside of the clearing leader entering the lane,
but only managed to chase that one before getting outkicked by an outer rival in the final sixteenth, then needed more to reach place. POINT AT YOU
tugged forward two wide and between horses to press the leader at the half mile pole, but got floated to the four path by that one approaching the three
furlong pole, failed to keep pace shortly after, then drifted inwardly in upper stretch and weakened on his left lead. CASINO BOSS tracked three wide but
weakened around the turn. DIFFERENT FLAME broke awkwardly and multiple lengths behind the rest, raced at the rear in the two to three path around the
turn and got outrun.

Footnotes
SANTA CRUISER vied two wide and between horses early on, sparred with his inner counterpart around the turn, wrestled an advantage in upper stretch,
drove clear inside the final furlong and lasted well from an inner bidder late. HERD IMMUNITY broke a step slow, settled off of the pace in the two path,
rallied in midstretch, split foes two wide at the sixteenth pole, sustained progress while aiming inside of the clear leader in the closing stages, but ran out of
ground to reel that one in. AFTER FIVE was off a step slow, stalked behind the leaders and from the two path, tipped to the three path in upper stretch,
chased before getting outkicked by an inner rival at the sixteenth pole and ran on to reach show. POPULIST set the pace inside of a pair of prompting foes
early on, dueled with only a single outer rival around the turn, got headed by that one in upper stretch and yielded in the final furlong. TWO WORLDS
prompted the pace three wide, chased his inner counterparts around the turn, got floated to the four path in upper stretch and gave way. STEINBECK broke
a beat slow, tracked in the three path, tipped to the five path entering the lane and lacked a bid. FERRYBOAT trailed in the three path and got outrun.
KHOZAN'S SUCCESS lacked speed in the four to six path and tired.

Footnotes
MY GOOD FORTUNE lagged behind off of the rail entering the backstretch, cut the gap under all-out urging in the two path around the far turn, sustained a
rally through the lane to bid inside of the drifting leader at the sixteenth pole, edged ahead and held from an outer challenger to the wire. LITTLE DIXIE
broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the two path, advanced along the inside turning for home, shifted outwardly while gaining show at the three
sixteenths pole, moved out more to remain outside of the drifting leader leaving the furlong grounds, sustained a bid along with an inner rival at the sixteenth
pole, but missed on the wire. LUNA MOTH prompted along the inside before allowing an outer rival to clear around the first turn, stalked outside of that rival
entering the backstretch, chased under urging around the far turn, yet offered a bid after shifting multiple paths away from that one in upper stretch, led at
the furlong grounds before drifting outwardly soon after and got bested by rivals on both sides in the final sixteenth. PACHANGA LOCA vied two wide,
tugged clear around the first turn, showed the way along the inside around the far turn, but was headed in midstretch and yielded through the final furlong.
LADY WITH A CAUSE was a bit restless awaiting the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, chased the top pair from the three path around the far
turn, got floated outwardly by an inner rival in upper stretch and flattened out. JUDY'S MS. OFFICER tracked two wide and between horses, but faded once
floated to the four path at the three furlong pole. MAGIC PALACE tracked three wide and weakened in the five path entering the far turn.

Footnotes
CEEPEEGEE vied along the inside, prolonged the duel while headed around the turn, gamely reclaimed an advantage at the furlong grounds, drove clear
shortly after and held off an outer bidder late. LIGHTNING MYQUEEN stalked along the inside, pursued from just off the top pair while taking the turn in the
two path, chased behind them through upper stretch, shifted three wide at the furlong grounds, sustained a grinding charge in pursuit of the clear leader in
the final sixteenth but needed more late. SPIRIT'S MISCHIEF vied two wide and outside of the eventual winner, clung to a narrow margin around the turn
and through upper stretch, but relinquished the advantage to his inner counterpart at the furlong grounds and yielded. BYE BYE LIAM lacked speed along
the inside, veered out to the six path approaching the five sixteenths pole causing trouble for an outer rival in the process, then stayed on outside of foes to
gain a minor share. NORWICH tracked two wide and between horses, but forced the rider to take a firm hold while bearing out slightly entering the turn, was
guided to the inside approaching the five sixteenths pole and ran on evenly. NUMERO SIETE bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked four wide,
chased the leaders from the three path around the turn and gave way between horses in the final furlong. KING OF THE PALACE chased three wide and
between horses, but steadied when an inner rival put him to crowded quarters entering the turn, pursued from the three to four path around the bend and
lacked a rally. BIG FIG broke a step slow before receiving contact from an inner rival at the start causing a slight bobble, then failed to factor from the two
path. THEZELENSKYYFACTOR broke outwardly, laid off of the pace in the three path and between horse and made little impact. LOMACHENKO raced at
the rear two wide into the turn and failed to factor. BIG HUNGRY lacked speed in the four path, but got forced outwardly and shied to the nine path
approaching the nine sixteenths pole and subsequently weakened. IRISH MOON broke a step slow and was outrun along the inside.

TEE BURNS bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack four wide, crept closer while fanning five wide entering the lane, rallied outside of
foes to bear down on the leader entering the final sixteenth, and edged ahead late. TAPE TO TAPE set the pace along the inside, drove clear in the two
path in upper stretch, held sway into the final furlong, but drifted out while getting collared by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole and was bested in the late
stages. FLAGS UP broke a step slow before taking contact from an outer rival at the start, trailed in the two to three path, fanned six wide entering the lane
and stayed on outside of rivals to gain show at the wire. SAMURAI PRINCE tracked three wide, entered the lane in the four path and between horses,
chased through the final furlong and got nailed by an outer rival for show. FRIAR LAURENCE stalked two wide and between horses, chased between
horses in the three path through the lane while vying for show, but missed that position to an outer pair at the wire. UPSTRIKER stalked along the inside but
only managed to chase through midstretch before fading through the final sixteenth. EMERALD EXPRESS was coaxed along off of the pace in the two path
and failed to factor. SENOR JOBIM laid off of the pace in the three path, came under urging around the turn and gave way.

HEARTYCONSTITUTION set the pace along the inside, showed the way in hand while taking the far turn in the two path, kicked away once set down in
upper stretch, drifted out briefly at the furlong grounds and edged further away while ridden out. SOUL OF AN ANGEL stalked along the inside, gained place
from an outer tiring foe while entering the lane in the three path and proved second best. JUNGLE JUICE (IRE) prompted outside of the eventual winner,
chased that foe from the three path around the far turn, but faded in the four path entering the lane and gave way on her left lead.

Footnotes
PROMISES TO DANCE set a clear pace early on, showed the way in hand in the two path around the turn, disallowed a rail bidder entering the lane, inched
away in upper stretch, dug in to resist an outer challenge in the final sixteenth and held firm. STREET JAM tracked along the inside, split foes two wide while
launching a rally in upper stretch, took aim outside of the clear leader in the final furlong, ranged up to bid in the final sixteenth but was kept at bay. STORY
HOUR broke outwardly, laid off of the pace in the three path, entered the lane four wide and stayed on to gain show late. LITTLE SISTER SUE raced at the
rear in the two path, improved inside of rival sin upper stretch chased between horses through the final furlong and missed reaching place. CORNER KICK
chased inside of rivals into the turn, attempted to slip inside of the leader to offer a bid nearing the lane, but steadied hard while lacking room at the quarter
pole, sustained a rail chase into through the final furlong and was bested show. PUNCHY GIRL stalked in the three path and between horses, then faded
after subtly shying from an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole. MARGOINABUBBLEBATH tracked in the four path and weakened five wide entering the
lane. THE RIDER OF CORNER KICK CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST PROMISES TO DANCE FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE QUARTER POLE, BUT THE
OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

sixteenth pole but missed via a head-bob. APRIL'S DIAMANTE bumped an outer rival soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the inside, vied with
an outer rival into and around the far turn, but was headed by an outer bidder passing the three sixteenths pole, then lasted for show in the closing stages.
MO SENSE settled off of the pace in the two path, trailed two wide around the turn, then rallied between horses in the final furlong, split foes in the late
stages and missed reaching show. MILA JUNES took contact to her hind quarters from foes on both sides at the start, laid off of the pace in the three to four
path around he turns and failed to menace. STAIRSTEP TOHEAVEN tracked four wide, moved to prompt outside of the leading pair entering the

Footnotes
OSBOURNE stalked in the four to three path, bid in the four path entering the lane, sparred through upper stretch, wrestled an advantage in the final furlong
and inched ahead late. SKY AND SAND vied outside of a rival and in the three path, led while tucking to the two path at the three furlong pole, shifted back
to the three path while resisting an outer challenge from OSBOURNE entering the lane, dueled with that one through upper stretch, but was headed leaving
the furlong grounds and fended off an inner rival for place. ANGKOR exchanged contact with an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, tipped to
the two path entering the lane, sustained a grinding charge to take aim inside of the leading pair coming to the final sixteenth, but was denied reaching
place. W W CANDY lacked speed in the two to three path into the turn, bumped an outer rival while shifting to the five path entering the lane, moved further
out in midstretch and stayed on late for a minor share. MAC DADDY TOO vied along the inside, chased his outer pace-setting counterpart turning for home
and faded in the final furlong. BOURBON HEIST lacked speed while hung in the five path into the turn, bumped with an inner rival while entering the lane in
the seven path and lacked a rally. BROKEN RIB laid off of the pace in the four path, then lacked a bid in the five path before yielding late. MIDNIGHT
ESCAPE pursued from midpack in the three path and between horses and gave way. CALL ME MIDNIGHT bumped with an inner rival at the start, then
saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. UNDER OATH broke slowly and trailed early on, steadied behind rivals passing the half mile pole, took the turn
in the four path and between horse, floated to the six path at the quarter pole before bumping with rivals on both sides entering the lane, and got outrun
thereafter.

Footnotes
HONOR MARIE trailed six wide around the turn, yet rallied outside of foes to offer a late bid and narrowly prevailed at the wire. BOURBON BOSS set the
pace two wide, tucked to the rail entering the turn, shook clear of an outer presser in upper stretch, but tired in the closing stages and got nailed at the wire.
RUN JALEN RUN advanced five wide into the turn to stalk, tucked to the three path before moving to press turning for home, but failed to keep pace with
the clearing leader in upper stretch, kept on as outer rivals ranged up in the final furlong, offered a re-bid along with the eventual winner in the closing stages
but got outfinished. ANTHONIAN tracked in the three path and between horses, spun for home in the four path and only managed to chase on his left lead.
LUCKY JEREMY prompted along the inside, chased his outer counterpart into the turn, split foes in the three path entering the lane but flattened out along
the rail. DASHMAN broke a step slow, lacked speed in the four to five path and failed to offer a bid. WISH CAREFULLY settled off of the pace along the
inside, fanned to the four path entering the lane and failed to factor. CONNIVING chased behind the leaders and from the two path, then caved entering the
lane. WISTUCKY broke a step slow, crept closer while chasing four wide and between horse into the turn, but faltered with three furlongs to go.
