Footnotes
MAIDEN LANE eased to the lead inside, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off under steady pressure. DORTH'S SOL DANCER well placed and
outside, moved up on the two path through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and closed well for the place. SHORESY tracked
the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then could not gain the final furlong and got up for the show.
TWISTED EMPRESS unhurried, passed tiring rivals outside. CUPID MISSED broke sharply and led early, stalked the leader to the turn, moved up to collar
that one through the turn, bid outside, then could not match strides and faded the final furlong. A ROSE FOR TINA was never involved.

Footnotes
GIANT PAYDAY well placed and off the rail, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch,
edging ahead, then drew off inside the furlong marker and was kept to the task. KICKS ON SIXTY SIX vied for the early lead on the inside, edged ahead
into the second turn, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then was no match late, while clearly best of the rest. STUNNING BABY allowed to settle,
looped up two and three wide through the second turn, angled widest into the stretch and closed well for the show. FARAT mid pack, saved ground on the
two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch and got up for a share. FLIGHT TO PARADISE well placed and outside, gained
position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. C THE KING unhurried, moved up three wide
through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened. WHISTLE ME HOME well placed and inside, lost some position through the
second turn, came through inside and had no stretch rally. LEAVE 'EM LOADED was no factor. GRIT AND GLORY sprinted away from the field, set the
pace off the rail and faded through the second turn.

the backstretch, came again in the lane and edged ahead, then weakened the final sixteenth. INCLUSIVE unhurried, saved ground through the turns, came
