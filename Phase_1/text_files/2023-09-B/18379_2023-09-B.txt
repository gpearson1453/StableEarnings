moved up on the turn and had the lead from the six path in deep stretch but was caught late. STRONG ATTITUDE showed speed from the inside, had a
clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held show. SUPREMEACTION was well back, trailed the field on the turn, angled
outside through the stretch and was up for a share. FIFTH SEASON settled off the pace and was roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the
stretch had no response. TWO YEAR CONTRACT was hustled early and a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left.

TAKE A CHANCE showed speed from the inside and set the pace, took command on the turn and was much the best. MONEY MATTERS stalked the early
leader and was a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. BRADY O'BRADY was off the pace, saved
ground on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished well. BIG TIME LOUIE showed no speed and was hustled along on the turn but
from the three path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. JAMAICAN JIMMY was in touch but chased on the turn and dropped back through the
stretch.

the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for a share. PENNIESFROMABOVE was off the pace, chased on the turn and was no real threat. PASSION
