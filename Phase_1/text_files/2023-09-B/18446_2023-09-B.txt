Footnotes
BUCHU saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two and three path,
launched a bid approaching the quarter pole and kicked clear. LUZ DIVINA pressed the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, dueled from the
two path around the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and was caught near the wire. MOSHINE raced in the three path early, settled in the middle of the
pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two path and gained ground on the outside late. BA DEE YAH laid off of
the pace two wide and between horses, was put to crowded quarters while among foes three wide at the three sixteenths pole, regained stride and ran on in
the late stages but narrowly missed show between horses. SHE IS INVINCIBLE (GB) lacked speed in the four path, shifted in and bumped an inner rival
coming to the quarter pole, gained along the rail in upper stretch before, steadied subtly while knifing three wide and between horses at the sixteenth pole
and missed reaching show. WITHOUT CAUSE was reluctant to load, tracked the top flight from the two path, shifted out to the four path around the far turn
before being floated five wide while outside of rivals entering the lane, but drifted inwardly multiple paths in upper stretch and tired through the final furlong.
PACE'S TWO SENSE saved ground early, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far bend in the two path and passed
tiring horses in the stretch. HIGH FASHION KATE led the way on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far
bend and faded in the stretch. AARALYN raced in the four path around the first turn, tracked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch and around
the far turn and faded in the lane. WEIGHTED AVERAGE raced at the back of the pack between horses through the opening half mile, steadied when
bumped and bothered by an outer rival approaching the quarter pole, then strode greenly through the lane. SPIRIT IN THE MIST (FR) saved ground at the
back of the pack, checked slightly behind troubled rivals approaching the quarter pole and made little impact. DASH OF LEMON ran out to the six path
headed into the first turn, trailed the field from there and was no factor. THE RIDER OF WEIGHTED AVERAGE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST SHE IS
INVICIBLE (GB) FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE QUARTER POLE; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE BABE dueled with an inner bidder into and around the turn, sustained the long battle through midstretch and inched ahead in the closing
stages. SWEET MIMI was off a bit slow, moved up to track the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, offered a rail bid at the half mile pole, sparred with
an outer rival while clinging to a narrow advantage around the turn, fought on gamely through midstretch but was bested late. ART QUEEN chased the
leaders between horses early, navigated the turn from the three path and kept on to the finish. BIKINI BOTTOM raced in the middle of the pack between
horses through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend and finished evenly. CORKAGE FEE veered in leaving the gate, recovered to stalk the
pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was outkicked in the lane. BACKWOODS BARBIE raced at the
back of the pack on the inside through the early going, saved ground around the bend, and passed tiring horses in the stretch. LADY OF DEVON prompted
between horses up the backstretch, pressed three wide around the turn, but weakened in the four path between horses entering the lane. WAMPUS
KITTEN pressed four wide early on, required urging to sustain position outside of rivals around the turn, got floated five wide entering the lane and gave
way. THE BIG BANSHEE raced at the back of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was empty in the
stretch.

ESCAPOLOGIST raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch and around the far bend, kicked clear in the lane and
held that margin to the wire. JR'S GIFT saved ground early, tracked the leader up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and gained ground
late. ROUTE RUNNER raced in the three path around the first bend, stalked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three
path coming around the second turn and chased on to the finish. B SUDD raced in the two path early, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the second turn and weakened in the lane. BRIGHT SPARK trailed the field while saving ground throughout and never threatened. WESLAN
raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the three and four path coming around the turn

and held that margin to the wire. GRAY'S FABLE bumped with the horses to both sides at the break, raced in the two path early, chased the leader between
horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and kept on to the finish. CELLIST bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate,

Footnotes
LADY RADLER tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn, began a bid entering the stretch, kicked clear
with a furlong to go and drew off. METAPHYSICAL raced off the pace on the inside early, began a bid from the two path coming around the turn, and
chased the winner home in the lane. YESTERNIGHT trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the bend, launched a bid approaching
the quarter pole and gained ground late. TWICE AS SWEET dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn
and weakened in the final furlong. SANTA FE GOLD raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter, came around the bend in the four path
and finished evenly. ALEXA LOU raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and finished evenly while
never threatening. B G WARRIOR dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.
NORAH G pressed the pace on the outside through the early going, navigated the turn from the three path and faded entering the lane. FLAMAND raced off
the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and made no bid.

Footnotes
BRU NA BOINNE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, dueled from the two path around the far turn and pulled clear in the lane. AMBER CASCADE raced in the two path early, settled in the middle
of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the four path to began a bid passing the quarter pole and chased the winner home.
LET'S DUET raced in the four path early, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two path and
gained ground mildly late. HER LADYSHIP stalked the pace setter on the outside through the opening half mile, began a bid from the three path coming
around the second turn and kept on to the finish. SHOPLIFTER saved ground around the first bend, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled
from the rail around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. FOREVER AFTER ALL raced in the three path early, continued up the backstretch off the
pace on the inside, saved ground around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. DAWNY raced in the four path around the first turn, came up the
backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, continued around the second turn in the four path and showed no kick. LEXA raced at the back of the
pack in the three path through the opening half mile, came around the far bend in the four path and made no bid. CALL AGAIN saved ground around the
first turn, raced into mild traffic entering the backstretch, tracked the leaders on the inside from there, navigated the far turn from the two path and faded in
the stretch. CHIQUITA MOSCA bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, raced in the three path early, trailed the field from there and was never a
factor.
