BANGO pressed the early pace two deep, dug in from the inside of GULFSTREAM WAY and prevailed in a determined run under strong pressure.
GULFSTREAM WAY tracked four wide, advanced under coaxing outside of rivals turning for home to bid nearing the lane, sparred with an inner BANGO
through the final furlong, but narrowly missed . NECKER ISLAND dropped back off the early pace, swung five to six wide into the upper stretch and finished
willingly to the wire. AWESOME AARON laid close up along the inside while under firm restraint, eased back to chase the leaders nearing the turn, tipped
out turning for home to bid three wide and between horses entering the lane, but weakened in midstretch. BAYTOWN BEAR was slow into gear, trailed
around the turn and never got involved STROBE showed good early foot from the inside, showed the way from an outer prompting BANGO into the turn, got
headed while inside of a trio of foes nearing the lane and weakened in upper stretch

Footnotes
WEST SARATOGA settled off the early going racing two deep, raced five wide into the upper stretch and finished well to edge clear under strong pressure.
RISK IT tracked the run-away leader from the three path, closed in along with an outer rival in upper stretch, but was outkicked by that one before gaining
place at the furlong grounds, chased into the final sixteenth, tired late but narrowly lasted for place. LIBERAL ARTS dropped back off the early pace, raced
three wide in the stretch, altered in near the sixteenth pole and kept on gamely to the wire. SEIZE THE GREY raced mid pack early on, drifted out through
the stretch and had not enough in the drive. EDIFIED was off a step slow before exchanging contact with an inner rival at the start, raced at the rear two
wide, gained turning for home before swinging six wide entering the lane, but only managed to pursue evenly before shying from an inner drifting rival at the
sixteenth pole, PATRIOT SPIRIT sprinted clear early on and was empty the final eighth of a mile. UNION ROLL bobbled and bumped with an outer rival at
the break, raced at the rear along the inside, saved ground and never threatened. MARKET STREET tracked the early leader from the inside and stopped.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
WEST SUNSET dropped back off the early pace, swung wide into the upper stretch, surged late and just got up under all out pressure. SWEET GAL OF
MINE tracked the early pair three deep, had a clear lead near the eighth pole, dug in deep stretch and missed in a game effort. BANG BANG FURY stalked
the pace, moved up four to five wide into the upper stretch, dug between and finished gamely to the wire. IRINA'S CHARM settled off the early pace, raced
five deep near the three sixteenths pole and kept on willingly to the wire. INTRICATE raced mid pack early on, was near the rail around the far turn, shifted
four wide and was even late. CLEAR VOICE showed good early foot along the inside and weakened. HIGH SHOT void of early speed, raced two to three
wide in the drive and had no response. REGULATORY RISK raced with the second flight early on, was five to six deep in the stretch and lacked a bid.
LILMS CONSTITUTION raced from the far outside in the lane and had no response. ALDORA stalked the pace along the inside and failed to sustain a bid.
CABERNEIGH sent along two deep and tired readily.
