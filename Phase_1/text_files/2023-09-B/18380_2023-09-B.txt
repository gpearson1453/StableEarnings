Footnotes
STANDFORGRIT broke alertly, vied for the early lead with PLEASANT WARNING then took back to track outside of that rival into the turn, stalked the
moderate pace from a two wide path along the bend, lost ground into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker, closed in deep stretch, caught
PLEASANT WARNING inside of the sixteenth marker and was up in the final strides to prevail. PLEASANT WARNING was sent to establish the early lead,
set a decent pace into the turn, carved out the fractions from the inside heading to the quarter marker, drew to a clear lead into upper stretch, took an
awkward step nearing the furlong pole and in the process Chavez lost his irons, held the lead to the sixteenth-marker, was overtaken by STANDFORGRIT
in the final strides and was edged for the win, while besting the rest. CALIGRAPHY chased the decent pace from the inside, gained a bit of ground nearing
the quarter marker, ran in pursuit into the stretch, finished evenly in the final furlong, was not able to impact the top two in deep stretch and was well clear
for third. SHEZA LUCKY CHARM bobbled at the start and was off slowly, chased the decent early pace while outside of rivals, raced two wide along the
turn, was steered three wide into the stretch, could not keep pace approaching the furlong marker and gave way.

Footnotes
CHAOKOON was forwardly placed away from the gate, took back to track the early pace and was guided three wide approaching the turn, was well
positioned while outside of rivals heading to the quarter marker, raced four wide into the stretch and ran evenly to mid-stretch, confronted WICKLOW HILLS
inside of the furlong pole, battled with that rival to the sixteenth-marker, surged in the final strides and held in a drive at the finish to prove best. WICKLOW
HILLS broke alertly, was asked to rate in the early running and stalked the decent pace while two wide, gained ground along the turn and came three wide
into the stretch, advanced to vie for the lead at mid-stretch, took a narrow advantage at the furlong marker, met the bid of CHAOKOON into the final
sixteenth, battled into the final yards and was bested at the finish, while clear of the rest for second. MEDAL ICE stalked the early pace while between
runners, angled to the rail approaching the turn and chased along the bend, saved ground into upper stretch and advanced nearing the furlong marker, was
outkicked into deep stretch and held clearly for third at the finish. BRONZE ONE tracked the early pace from the inside, raced in tight quarters approaching
the half-mile marker, took up at that station and was steered outside of rivals into the turn, chased from the two path along the bend, swung five wide into
the stretch and lacked a response in the drive. TEAGANS ATM was hustled to establish the early lead, set a decent pace into the turn and carved out the
fractions heading to the quarter marker, drifted a bit off of the rail into upper stretch, came under pressure at mid-stretch and was overtaken nearing the
furlong pole, could not keep pace into deep stretch and tired in the final stages.

ABOVE THE FOLD engaged with MIRAGE CODE in the early running and disputed a decent pace with that rival into the turn, pressed inside of MIRAGE
CODE along the turn, shook free of that rival and assumed command into upper stretch, was kept to task under steady urging to the sixteenth-marker, was
confronted in deep stretch by BETTOR BET'R, gamely dug in in the final strides and lasted for the win at the finish. BETTOR BET'R hopped at the start and
was off a bit slowly, recovered in the early running and tracked the dueling pacesetters into the turn, chased two wide to the quarter marker, was steered to
the three path into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, responded to urging and rallied into the final sixteenth, confronted ABOVE THE
FOLD in deep stretch, switched to the left lead in the final yards, made a steady advance approaching the finish but was held at bay by the determined
winner and just missed at the wire, while well clear of the rest for second. OOPS AND DOWNS settled off of the contentious early pace, raced three wide
into the turn and was coaxed along in the four path into upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, finished well in the late stages, was not able to
impact the top two in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. MIRAGE CODE broke alertly and showed good speed away from the gate, engaged
with ABOVE THE FOLD in the early running and set a quick pace into the turn, dueled through moderate fractions while outside of ABOVE THE FOLD
heading to the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch, chased to the furlong pole and faded in the final stages. WEEPING WILLOWS lacked early
speed, lost contact with the field along the turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
MORO FIRST CLASS broke alertly and quickly took the early lead, put some distance on the field through the turn then held sway through the stretch
despite racing on the wrong lead. MO TOWN GAL raced between the trip tracking the pace, drew off from those rivals at the top of the stretch and chased
the winner home, clearly second best. BLUE EYED JO broke well, raced inside of three horses tracking the pacesetter to the turn, held the inside through
the turn then ran on well down the stretch to gain third while never a threat to the winner. SHEZA QUEEN BEE was a bit slow into stride but soon found a
good rhythm, raced near the rear of the very compact field, made a tepid middle move four wide through the turn and finished even-paced. MARNAYS
QUEEN hopped at the start then pulled forward to the second spot with the rider doing his best to harness her speed, went four wide into the turn, was let
loose approaching the three furlong marker, made a brief run then gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
CLASS CODE contested the early lead with REMEMBER SUE then took command into the backstretch run, was well handled through decent fractions to
the half-mile marker, quickened the tempo a bit while showing the way to the quarter pole, drew off under moderate urging approaching mid-stretch, was
given a trio of right-handed reminders into the final sixteenth and was geared down in the final strides for an easy win. NORTHERN ROSE bobbled at the
start and was off a bit slowly, was allowed to settle in the early running and raced outside of rivals along the first turn, gained ground along the backstretch
run, continued that advance along the far turn while three wide, chased CLASS CODE into the stretch and was outrun to the furlong marker, closed willingly
in the late stages, was not able to impact the winner in deep stretch and held well for second at the finish. STEIN'S GIRL settled inside of runners into the
first turn, gained ground along the backstretch run, was steered to the two path into the far turn and chased to the quarter marker, ran in pursuit into the
stretch, closed well inside of the furlong marker, could not get by NORTHERN ROSE for second in the final sixteenth and held clearly at the finish for third.
SPLICER tracked the early pace and went three wide into the first turn, made a middle move while outside of rivals and came within aim nearing the
half-mile pole, kept close attendance to CLASS CODE while two wide approaching the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and weakened
in the final furlong. REMEMBER SUE was sent leaving the start and vied for the early lead into the first turn, conceded the lead to CLASS CODE into the
backstretch run and stalked inside of that rival through decent fractions to the half-mile marker, dropped back approaching the second turn, was eased
through the stretch and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
HAYWOOD was prominent in the early running, took back and tracked the solid early pace from the inside, chased from the rail along the turn, angled three
wide into the stretch, waited a bit for racing room at mid-stretch and shifted four wide at the furlong marker, closed with a rush into deep stretch, confronted
MELANIE'S TIGER inside of the sixteenth-marker, surged past the runner-up in the final strides and was up in time to prevail. MELANIE'S TIGER was
bothered at the start by a neighboring rival and was off slowly, regrouped in the early stages and chased to the turn, picked off rivals along the bend and
loomed three wide nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch and took command at the furlong marker, raced on the left lead while
holding a slim advantage into deep stretch, felt pressure from HAYWOOD inside of the sixteenth marker, met that bid to the final yards and was bested at
the finish, while holding clearly for second. HERMELINDA'S FANCY ducked in a few strides out of the gate and bothered MELANIE'S TIGER, chased the
solid pace from the inside, saved ground to the top of the stretch, responded to urging into deep stretch, finished well inside of the sixteenth pole and was up
in the final strides to secure third. LAST BABY broke alertly and was prominent in the early going, contested the early pace with CLASSY CITY and pressed
outside of that rival into the turn, pressed the decent pace to the quarter marker and vied for the lead into the stretch, battled with MELANIE'S TIGER into
the final sixteenth, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and was just edged for third at the finish. CLASSY CITY was asked to show speed leaving
the break and assumed command in the early stages, set a solid pace while pressured into the turn, carved out decent fractions from the rail while pressed
to the quarter marker, battled for the lead into the stretch, could not keep pace inside of the furlong marker and weakened late. FORMIDABLE THREAT was
forwardly placed in the early running, tracked the decent early pace while outside of rivals and raced three wide into the turn, lost ground heading to the
quarter marker, came two wide into the stretch and gave way. ELEGANT BOY was hustled leaving the start and raced close to the decent early pace, came
three wide into the turn, lost position along the bend and chased two wide to the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and tired. BOOK EM TAMO
lacked early speed, raced four wide into the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
SHOT OF A LIFETIME was floated three to four wide through the first turn then moved to a stalking position just off the flank of BRONZE WARRIOR,
remained in that spot through the far turn, kept pace when that one quickened passing the five-sixteenths pole, went to challenge approaching the stretch,
found no resistance, took the lead then was immediately tackled by HEY MATE to the outside but repelled the bid of his stablemate and drew away in the
final stages. HEY MATE got away well and seized the rail, tracked the pace under a hold through the early stages, bided time through the far turn then
tipped out to the three path for the stretch run, responded to strong handling but could not reel in the eventual winner. LIL MIRACLE MAN broke well then
was content to sit off the pace while racing close up, started a run from the five sixteenths pole, came into the stretch in the three path and rallied to gain the
show while never a threat to the top two. BRONZE WARRIOR was sent for the early lead from the break, settled in hand down the backstretch, held the
lead to the quarter pole then was challenged by SHOT OF A LIFETIME and HEY MATE, gave way readily to those two and was passed for third inside the
sixteenth pole. RACKATAPTAP was pushed from the gate to avoid getting hung wide into the first turn but was unsuccessful and shuffled back near the
seven-eighths pole, made steady forward progress to the half mile pole to move into a nice tracking position, struggled to keep pace through the turn while
under a drive and could not improve position. SUNNY SPOT threw his head just before the start and was last from the gate, saved ground under a light hold
near the back, encountered some traffic heading into the far turn, attempted to rally from the seven-sixteenths pole but finished one-paced and never a
threat. TWIRLING DERBY came away a step slow and fanned four to five wide on the first turn, continued to race wide down the backstretch near the rear
of the pack, came under a ride from the half mile marker but was unable to keep up and chased the field to the wire.

Footnotes
KERRY GOLD threw his head at the start and was off slowly, chased the field into the first turn and raced outside of rivals into the backstretch run, improved
position at the half-mile marker, came three wide into the far turn, swung five wide into the lane and was full of run approaching mid-stretch, closed
determinedly into the final sixteenth, drew to even terms with BOOMING BERNARDO in deep stretch, battled with that rival into the final yards and surged
at the finish to prevail in a blanket finish. BOOMING BERNARDO was forwardly placed leaving the break, was a bit keen along the first turn and stalked the
decent early pace from the inside, was well placed while saving ground through the backstretch run, maintained that rail trip into the far turn, tipped two wide
for the stretch drive and vied for the lead heading to mid-stretch, took command at the furlong pole and showed the way into deep stretch, met the late bid of
KERRY GOLD and gamely battled with that rival to the final yards, was nipped at the finish for the win and just held for the place in a blanket finish. DAZZLE
THE COMMAND settled off of the decent early pace and tracked from the two path along the first turn, was well positioned through the backstretch run,
maintained that two wide path into the far turn, came in tight approaching the quarter marker and waited for racing room nearing the top of the stretch,
continued to race in tight into upper stretch, found a seam and split rivals heading to the furlong marker, closed well into deep stretch, surged in the final
strides and just missed for the win and place, while holding safely for the show at the finish. DEFENSOR FORTIS broke alertly and was forwardly placed in
the early stages, stalked the early pace while three wide into the first turn, was well positioned through the backstretch run and maintained that three wide
path into the far turn, tracked the leaders to the quarter marker and was roused four wide into the stretch, gained ground into the lane and vied for the lead
at the furlong pole, could not match strides with the top three into deep stretch and was outkicked in the final stages. MOGOLLON RIM was unhurried in the
early stages, saved ground while off of the rail along the first turn, continued to race off of the rail through the backstretch run, slipped to the inside along the
far turn and saved all of the ground to the top of the stretch, mounted an inside bid approaching mid-stretch, raced in tight at the furlong marker, found room
into deep stretch, could not muster the needed late response and finished evenly. VINNIEBOB settled off of the early pace and raced outside of rivals into
the first turn, came four wide into the backstretch run and gained ground heading to the half-mile marker, chased two wide to the quarter marker, angled four
wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds and lacked a late rally. DEO was prominent leaving the start and attended to the early pace, stalked
the pacesetter through decent fractions along the backstretch run, kept close attendance to CHELSIESDANZIGLITE while two wide heading to the quarter
marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE broke a step slowly, was hustled to establish the early lead and
dictated terms into the first turn, set decent fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, showed the way to the quarter marker, was overtaken
approaching the furlong pole and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
ALL HALLOWS broke alertly, eased to the front racing three wide through the first turn, opened up down the backstretch always traveling well in hand,
quickened away through the turn, increasing the lead, was shortening strides in the final furlong but had enough to win clear. FRESNO CHILE settled inside,
tracked in hand two deep down the backstretch, hooked up with KOKO'S MOM with three furlongs to run, got the best of that foe in mid-stretch and held for
the place. KOKO'S MOM was unprepared for the start, then circled the field through the clubhouse turn, moved into contention near the five furlong pole
while racing four deep, started a rally with three furlongs to run, was joined to the inside by FRESNO CHILE, was unable to threaten the winner and was
bested for second. PRESTIGIOUS broke out and made some light contact with AUTISM SHINE after the break, raced at the back of the pack to the far turn,
began a belated rally from about the three furlong marker, sustained the rally through the stretch and managed to split the field. AUTISM SHINE broke in
and made some mutual contact with PRESTIGIOUS then was able to get good position through the first turn, settled into a stalking position down the
backstretch between a trio of horses chasing the runaway leader, began to struggle to keep up passing the seven-sixteenths marker and came up empty in
the stretch. THE RIVER MANGITA outrun to the first turn, dropped back to the back of the pack, had trouble keeping pace after the half and began to lose
ground, came under a hard ride from the three furlong marker but could not improve position and had nothing to offer in the late stages. ZEE PERFECT
RUN was hustled from the break and gained the rail and the lead before the seven-eighths marker, ceded the lead at the six-furlong pole, came under
heavy pressure once past the half and had little to offer from that point.
