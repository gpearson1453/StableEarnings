Footnotes
BLUE KENTUCKY tracked from the two path, chased through upper stretch while slowly closing in, then ran on to split the top pair entering the final
sixteenth and wore down the tiring leader late. BOURBON SPIRIT prompted outside of the leader while in hand in the four path, forged an advantage while
tucking to the three path entering the turn, showed the way before meeting an outer challenge turning for home, repelled that rival in upper stretch, but
began to tire entering the final sixteenth and was caught in the closing stages. SOARING BIRD stalked in the four path, ranged up to the leader turning for
home to attempt a bid, but was turned away by that one in upper stretch, sustained a chase into the final furlong, but was outkicked by an inner rival at the
sixteenth pole, then missed reaching place while saving show. SOLIDIFY broke slowly, trailed along the inside, fanned to the five path entering the lane,
stayed on while closing in on tiring rivals in the final furlong and missed reaching show. HEMP HEAVEN was off a bit awkwardly while not costed position,
chased in the five path, but gave way in the six path entering the lane. CLASSY SOCKS set the pace along the inside, got headed by an outer vying foe
entering the turn and weakened nearing the lane.

Footnotes
ONE COOL DUDE leaned outwardly at the start, set the pace inside of a pressing foe, drew off entering the lane and was ridden out through the final
furlong. CAMP DADDY brushed with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch and rallied to
edge place in the late stages. STONEVICIOUS took contact from an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside, sustained a rail chase to vie for place in
the final furlong, but was outfinished by an outer bidder late. ASPEN CLUB pressed the pace setter while remaining wide down the backstretch, tucked
down to the three path entering the turn, but came under urging turning for home, failed to keep pace entering the lane and folded up between horses.
ROMAN GIANT laid off of the pace in the three path, floated to the five path entering the lane and failed to factor. RUN RUN RAPIDASH was bumped by an
inner rival at the start, tracked in the three to four path entering the lane and weakened. ALMANZO bounced off an outer rival at the start, trailed around the
turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
CHRYSO ALOGO prompted outside of the pace setter and from the three path, but subtly failed to keep pace with that one passing the three furlong pole,
chased between horses at the five sixteenths pole, yet regained stride entering the lane, bid again at the furlong grounds and edged past. FLOTATION
STATION set the pace inside of a pressing foe into the turn, inched clear of that one nearing the five sixteenths pole, but was collared once again by that
rival in midstretch, got bested entering the final sixteenth and saved place from an outer bidder late. RIVETAGE tracked along the inside, but lacked the
needed kick to bid inside of the leader in upper stretch, altered course outwardly at the furlong grounds after the hole closed, then ran on late to miss
reaching place. RUNNIN MUNNIN laid off of the pace outside of foes, shifted in and advanced two wide and between horses at the half mile pole, shifted
out to the four path and sustained progress around the turn to be within striking range nearing the lane, but flattened out in upper stretch and tired. THIS
TIME BLUE chased from midpack in the four path and gave way. MIDCAT made little impact from the three path. QUENCIO lacked speed along the inside
and never got involved. QUERREQUE bobbled shortly after the start, lost contact with the rest of the field in the opening stages, then jogged home while
distanced.

Footnotes
INFORMED PATRIOT vied two wide and between horses into the turn, led turning for home, drew clear in upper stretch, dug in late as an outer TOP GUN
ROCKET menaced and held firm. TOP GUN ROCKET tracked the leading trio from the two path, shifted outside of them entering the lane, rallied with a
determined charge in the final furlong to offer a bid in the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay late. LAT LONG pursued from midpack in the four path, entered
the lane in the six path, rallied outside of rivals through the lane but needed more while pursuing the top pair late. GOULD'S GOLD broke a step slow,
lacked speed in the three path, yet offered a belated kick in the final furlong to reach fourth at the wire. MASMAK prompted the pace three wide, but failed to
keep pace with the leader in upper stretch and yielded between horses. MUAZARAH set the pace inside of a pair of prompting rivals, sparred with them
around the turn, got headed turning for home and weakened. GOLDEN BUCK broke slowly and got outrun.

Footnotes
ICE ORCHID prompted the pace two wide, vied into the far turn, led approaching the five sixteenths pole, entered the lane in the three path while inching
clear, delayed a lead change until the three sixteenths pole, and edged away thereafter. SKRATCH KAT trailed, narrowed the gap on the rest of the field
while turning for home in the three path, altered course out to the six path n upper stretch, then stayed on while hanging on her left lead to bid for place in
the final sixteenth and prevailed in the photo for that position. CHOP CHOP tracked three wide, required urging to sustain position around the far turn before
getting floated to the four path entering the lane, then chased the clear leader while vying for place between rivals through the final furlong, but was nailed
by an outer bidder for that position at the wire. MUSIC STREET tracked in the two path, inched closer four wide around the far turn, fanned five wide
entering the lane, leveled off and vied for place with inner rivals through midstretch, but was bested by an outer rival late and missed that position. JAG
WARRIOR set the pace inside of a prompting foe, got headed by that one approaching the five sixteenths pole, gave way in upper stretch before vying with
outer rivals for place through midstretch, but yielded late. SELINA KYLE (PER) popped open the gate as others were still loading, lost her rider while
remaining in the assistant starter's grasps upon leaving the stalls, then was reloaded without further incident, stalked along the inside, pursued from the two
path around the far turn and chased behind rivals through the lane.

Footnotes
OTTO THE CONQUEROR dueled for the lead inside of DRAGOON GUARD, drew clear of that one in upper stretch, but began to tire entering the final
sixteenth and just lasted to the wire. DRAGOON GUARD dueled for the lead two wide, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch,
kept on as that one tired in the final sixteenth, produced a rebid coming to the wire but missed. BOURBON'S FAULT tucked behind rivals at the five furlong
pole, tracked along the inside, took the turn in the two path before tipping to the four path entering the lane, then chased the top pair, met an inner challenge
for show at the sixteenth pole, but saved that position after that bidder faltered. NUEVO EMPIRE broke a step slow before stumbling soon after the start,
raced at the rear in the two path into the turn, split foes coming to midstretch, ran on to bid for place along the inside at the sixteenth pole, but leaned
inwardly feeling a right handed crop in the late stages, required rider correction to avoid from hitting the inner rail and flattened out. J BIRD TIME raced at
the rear in the three path, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch and moved up. TIME SONG steadied briefly when put to crowded quarters between
a pair of foes leaving the chute, tugged to a stalking position from the two path, shifted to the three path into the turn, but only managed to chase before
yielding in the five path entering the lane. TITLE CONTENDER broke a step slow, pursued from midpack four wide, fanned to the six path entering the lane
and failed to factor. SWEET AS SIN chased while forward three wide and between horses, but faded with three furlongs to go. STORMIN LOVE lacked
speed in the three path, tucked to the inside entering the turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
GILCREASE set the pace inside of a pressing rival while a path off of the rail, tucked to the fence entering the turn before getting headed by his outer
counterpart shortly after, sustained inside vying position around the turn, fought on and prolonged the war in upper stretch, battled through the final furlong
and gamely prevailed. EASY ACTION broke a tough outwardly, prompted outside of the leader from the three to two path into the turn, forged an advantage
at the three furlong pole, battled with his inner counterpart via a long duel and got outgamed late. TRACK MATE tracked three wide, then failed to keep
pace with the embattled top pair in upper stretch and held show. TIM TAL stalked along the inside, checked in crowded rail quarters at the half mile pole,
then only managed to chase through the lane. BOHEMIAN BO bumped with an inner rival at the start, tugged forward two wide and between horses, but
steadied when put to tight quarters behind the leader at the half mile pole, got rank in the aftermath, settled into stride passing the three furlong pole, but
lacked a bid before tiring in midstretch. KING ME bumped with an outer rival at the start and got outrun.

Footnotes
B D VALESKI pursued from midpack three wide, fanned to the five path in upper stretch, produced a good kick under moderate urging to sweep past the
leaders at the furlong grounds, quickly drew clear and held under confident handling. SUMMER IN MALIBU laid off of the pace in the three path, faltered
briefly behind foes and lost position entering the turn, shifted from the four to six path entering the lane, rallied outside of foes to gain place in the final
sixteenth and closed in on the well-traveling leader late. ARABIAN PRINCE trailed, spun to the five path entering the lane and stayed on in the final furlong
to gain show late. HIDEKI pursued from midpack in the two path, encountered traffic behind rivals in upper stretch, split foes in midstretch, ran on among
horses late but got outfinished for show. ALL I WANT IS YOU stalked along the inside, took aim two wide and between foes in upper stretch, bid inside of
the leader coming to midstretch but was swiftly outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong grounds and gradually yielded. KIGALI vied two wide, led turning for
home, entered the lane in the three path, but proved no match for an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and gave way between foes. OVERBORE laid off
of the pace along the inside, then encountered mild traffic through the lane and lacked a bid. CUSTOM BOBBY'S stalked in the three path, floated to the
four path entering the lane and weakened between horses in midstretch. PAT'SCHROMECOMPASS vied along the inside, but was headed by her outer
counterpart at the five sixteenths pole and weakened through the final furlong.

Footnotes
METHODOLOGY stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair at the three furlong pole, bid in upper stretch, sparred with a rail bidder through the
final furlong, exchanged contact with that one approaching the wire and prevailed via a photo. HAPPY CHARGER laid off of the pace in the three path,
gained between horses turning for home, bumped an inner rival while taking aim inside of the top pair in upper stretch, offered a rail bid in midstretch,
dueled with outer METHODOLOGY through the final furlong, exchanged shoulders with that one coming to the wire and missed. LEAFLET lunged in and
bumped a rival at the start, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, fanned to the five path in upper stretch and stayed on. MUSICAL MISCHIEF
vied for the lead two wide, led turning for home, but yielded between horses in midstretch. MISINTENTION took contact from an outer rival at the start,
raced off of the pace along the inside, shied from an outer rival entering the lane, then bumped an outer foe while slipping inside of that one in upper stretch
and chased the leaders through the final furlong. PERCEPTIVE steadied early on, trailed, then improved position in the six path and between horses
entering the lane. NOCTURNE COURT broke a step slow, got hung in the five to seven path while off of the pace and failed to factor. SISTER MAHA
bumped with an outer rival at the start, vied along the inside, but weakened nearing the lane, then was jostled between horses in upper stretch. WILD
ACCLAIM bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the four path and weakened between horses turning for hoe. MUCHO MACHO
CHICK pursued from midpack in the two path but faded between horses nearing the lane.
