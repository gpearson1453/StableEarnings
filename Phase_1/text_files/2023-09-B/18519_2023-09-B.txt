Footnotes
CATHERINE BLAZE trailed in the two path, moved out of last in the three path around the far turn, grinded away in the four to five path and between horses
coming to midstretch, sustained progress to bid in the final sixteenth along with an outer rival and prevailed. MALIBU SMART tracked three wide, but faded
in the four path approaching the far turn, regained stride in the five to six path in upper stretch, changed over at the three sixteenths pole, stayed on along
with an inner rival to offer a bid in the closing stages, but came up short. BIG DIG laid off of the pace in the two path, checked close to heels at the seven
and a half furlong pole, steadied in a firmer manner entering the backstretch, inched closer three wide around the far turn, took aim in the four path entering
the lane, bid while briefly flopping back to his left lead and subtly wandering about at the furlong grounds, drove clear before doing so again as a pair of
outer rivals bid in the late stages and got caught in the shadow of the wire. REQUESTFORPROPOSAL stalked two wide and between horses down the
backstretch, ranged up to bid in the three path entering the lane, sparred through upper stretch before being outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong
grounds, and yielded. PROUD PERFORMER set the pace along the inside, resisted an outer challenge while entering the lane in the two path, dueled
through upper stretch but yielded passing the furlong grounds. MIKITA tracked along the inside, but steadied while failing to slip inside of the early pace
setter in upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
ARDEN'S ASSAULT bumped an outer rival at the start, set a clear pace along the inside, maintained a wide margin through upper stretch, but flopped back
to his left lead passing the furlong grounds while beginning to tire, yet lasted safely late. FAST GAL laid off of the pace in the three path, then stayed on in
the four path to gain place in the late stages. SUMMER OF MISCHIEF stalked the clear leader from the two path while inside of pair of rivals around the
turn, clung to place into midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival late. MAZOKU tracked in the four path, vied for place with an inner rival through
midstretch, but yielded while getting outkicked a sixteenth from home. JACKIE'S SPIRIT took contact from an inner rival at the start, tracked in the three
path and between horses around the turn, but faded nearing the lane. FLORIS was outrun two wide. ATHENAIS lacked speed along the inside and was
done early.

Footnotes
ZING stalked along the inside, ranged up outside of the leading pair around the far turn, bid turning for home, led in upper stretch and kicked away
approaching the furlong grounds. BRITTLE AND YOO set the pace inside of a prompting foe, got headed by that one and an outer bidder at the three
furlong pole, regained place from his most immediate counterpart in midstretch and held that position. VITAEMI prompted the pace two wide, led
approaching the three furlong pole as an outer rival saddled-up alongside, got outkicked by that one in upper stretch then surrendered place to his inner
counterpart at the furlong grounds. HASHTAG WINNER trailed along the inside, chased the leading trio from the two path around the far turn, shifted
outside of them leaving upper stretch but lacked a bid. KLOEPATRA broke a step slow, tracked in the two to three path, but weakened under urging in the
four path entering the far turn, was done early and eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
FIELD LASS set the pace in the two path, drew off entering the lane and was put to hand with the deal sealed in the final sixteenth. NEOM BEACH pressed
the leader from the three path, required urging to sustain pressure around the turn, but failed to keep pace with that entering the lane and remained clear of
show. BIG DREAMER chased along the inside, gained show from an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole and lacked progress thereafter. LEGAL
DECEIVER broke a step slow and bumped with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed two wide, then stayed on in the three path and between horses in
the final furlong to reach fourth at the wire. TOASTED ROLL broke a step slow, advanced approaching the turn to track in the four path, but gradually
yielded through the lane and got nailed by an inner rival for fourth. SAVE THE MISCHIEF broke slowly then steadied when an inner rival shifted across her
path, trailed in the three path into the turn, drifted inwardly in upper stretch and stayed on along the rail through the final furlong. ADRASTEIA laid off of the
pace in the three path, then failed to factor in the four to five path. INNOCENT NYGHT was antsy behind the starting gate, then bumped with an inner rival
at the start, pursued from midpack in the two path and gave way between horses. SMILING ELLIE broke a step slow, then got briefly rank when put to
crowded quarters between rivals soon after the start, lacked speed in the five to four path into the turn, then weakened in the six path in upper stretch.
GOLDEN STORM was outsprinted by outer rivals early on after breaking towards the front and got outrun along the inside. MISS PEARL HART pursued
from midpack in the five to six path and weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
RIVALRY set a clear pace while keen moving through the lane for the first time, settled under snug restraint in the three path around the first turn before an
outer MOUNT CRAIG applied pressure entering the backstretch, sparred with that bidder around the far turn, shook clear entering the lane and drew off.
ICE TIME raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, then stayed on to gain place between horses in the final sixteenth. MOUNT CRAIG stalked
along the inside entering the first turn, moved forward to press outside of the leader and from the four path leaving it, dueled under urging around the far
turn, but yielded entering the lane, gave way, lost place to an inner rival in the late stages and saved show. TIZ WICKED STRONG saved ground off of the
pace and ran on to miss reaching show. FAST CHAD lagged behind and never got involved. HARBOUR BRIDGE tracked in the three to four path, but failed
to maintain position in the early stages of the backstretch and weakened around the far turn.

WASHINGTON'S UNION stalked two wide, bid passing the three furlong pole, assumed command entering the lane and drew off. EXEMPLIFIED tracked
along the inside, altered course out to the four path in midstretch, stayed on along with an outer rival and edged place. TRICOLOUR tracked two wide and
between horses, failed to sustain that position approaching the far turn, improved outside of foes once roused three wide around the far turn, spun to the five
path in upper stretch, then stayed on late but was outfinished for place by an inner rival. GO CATS tracked three wide, chased two wide and between
horses into the far turn and faded turning for home. GOLDEN FLASH set the pace along the inside, met an outer challenge at the three furlong pole, proved
no match for that one entering the lane and weakened. SILVER RALEIGH leaned inwardly and grazed a rival at the start, then trailed throughout and was

DASH ATTACK set the pace inside of a vying rival, dueled with that one around the far turn, shook free in upper stretch and held sway. TWILIGHT BLUE
vied two wide outside of the eventual winner, sparred with that one around the far turn, but yielded in upper stretch and safely maintained place. KING
FURY saved ground off of the pace, trailed around the far turn, then stayed on inside of rivals to gain show at the sixteenth pole. KITTANSETT tracked the
leading pair from the two path, chased while failing to progress around the far turn and lacked a bid. NOTARY laid off of the pace in the two to three path,
spun into the lane in the four path, but drifted out at the furlong grounds and faded.

Footnotes
HE'S GOT SWAGGER saved ground off of the pace, advanced to stalk into the far turn, sustained a rail bid coming to midstretch and drove clear. THE
PRINCE'S SPUR tracked two wide and between horses, took closer order to stalk in the two path entering the second bend, bid outside of the leader and
from the four path around the far turn, vied through upper stretch but was outkicked by an inner rival at the furlong grounds. IDRATHERBEBLESSED
prompted outside of the leader while multiple paths away, led in the three path entering the far turn as an outer rival menaced, got headed by that one in
upper stretch and yielded between horses in the final furlong. MAASAI WARRIOR trailed in the two path, advanced in the four path nearing the final bend,
but chased in the three path around that turn and lacked a bid. JUST A PHOTO pursued from midpack in the three path but faded between horses
approaching the far turn. DEVIL'S HARVEST set the pace inside of a prompting foe, but faltered into the far turn, was eased nearing the lane, jogged across
the wire and walked off.
