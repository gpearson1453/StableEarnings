Footnotes
GIRVIN'S PRINCESS had early speed inside, angled out nearing the half-mile pole, prompted the pace in the three path, took over nearing the
five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. JAZZIN steadied at the start, saved ground off the pace and ran on for the place. CASTELLANA was up
close down the backstretch, steadied off heels approaching the half-mile pole, angled to the rail entering the turn, tipped back out three wide near the
five-sixteenths marker and lacked the needed rally. KOZEM chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. SURVIVAL ROSE failed to menace while
racing three and four wide. WHATS UP BUTTERCUP was outrun outside. MISS ATHLETIC set the pace in the two path and retreated after a half. AN
OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF CASTELLANA AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE HALF-MILE POLE WAS
NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
NEVER SATISFIED trailed in the four path early, tipped inward under coaxing rounding the turn, rallied from the rail into the stretch, took the lead shortly
after the eighth pole, and held off a late charging outer foe. UBIQUITOUS rated in the two path, tipped out to the five path and was cued midway around the
turn, fanned out to the seven path into the stretch, ran on while drifting inwards, and just missed to finish with place. EARTH chased in the six path, was
under right handed encouragement in the four path rounding the turn, got shuffled back to last entering the stretch, shifted out to center passing the eighth
pole, and got up for show. LITTLE JUANITO prompted the pace inside of foes in the two path, swung out to the six path under a drive into the lane, but was
one paced. ABE HONESTLY laid up close in the three path, headed the outer pacesetter from the rail rounding the turn, led while tipping back out to the
three path into the stretch, but faded in the final furlong. ALLEGEDLY PERFECT set the pace out in the five path, was headed by an inner foe while in the
three path rounding turn, and yielded while in the four path passing the eighth pole.

KINGY for the place in the final furlong, bumped with that foe late and just missed second. CAJUN ASP set the early pace in the two path and gave way
near the three-eighths marker. DOWNEY'S WAY was outrun while racing three wide. ADIAMOND ISFOREVER had only brief speed four wide.

Footnotes
FULL NELSON tracked in the four path, was ridden in the five path around the turn, floated out to the seven path entering the lane, rallied past a dueling
inner pair just after the eighth pole, and drew clear in the final sixteenth. PRAISEWORTHY led between foes in the two path, was headed by an inner foe
while in the three path rounding the turn, dug in from the five path into the stretch, lugged in while holding a short lead passing the eighth pole, was no
match for the eventual winner, but kept on to win a duel for place. RED ABARRIO vied for the lead inside, stuck a nose in front under a ride in the two path
passing the quarter, swung out to the four path into the lane, lost the lead and was herded in passing the eighth pole, but evened out for show. SANPIRODU
was hustled along while behind and inside, under right handed encouragement in the two path rounding the turn, tipped out to the six path into the stretch,
but made no impact. ADIOS NOW prompted the pace in the three path, received right handed cues rounding the turn, but faded in the two path down the
lane. GO GO SANTI rated in the two path, but weakened from the rail in the stretch.

Footnotes
WICKLOW GAL set the pace in the two path and held sway under a drive. CONFER raced in range four wide, advanced four wide around the far turn,
continued on the left lead in the lane and could only gain slightly on the winner. R AWESOME SAUCE stalked the winner three wide, could not match
strides in the final furlong but lasted for the show. GRANDMA'S PUDDING raced off the pace three wide, edged closer five wide around the far turn but was
one-paced through the lane. NOTHING BUT PUMPS saved ground and failed to menace. GRATIA saved ground off the pace and lacked a closing bid.
KILKENNY BELLA had her head turned at the start and was never a threat while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
STARTONAHIGHNOTE set the pace in the two path, opened up around the turn, was roused passing the quarter, extended his advantage while still in the
two path into the stretch, and held safe under a drive. STERLING HARMONY raced off the pace in the three path, was driven between foes approaching the
quarter, swung out the six path at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. EXCHANGE DAY chased in the two path, was under coaxing inside of foes
rounding the turn, and kept on from the rail down the stretch for show. BELLA FUTURE prompted the pace in the four path, was driven from said position
turning into the lane, but flattened in the final furlong. COMMANDANT stalked in the five path, lost ground under a ride around the turn, floated out to the
seven path into the stretch, and did not factor. DROPKICK MURPHY pressed in the three path, but faded in the stretch. INFAMOUS NONO had to steady
early, and always trailed around the five to seven paths.

Footnotes
SWASHBUCKLE set the pace in the two path, was headed leaving the eighth but dug in gamely inside of that foe and prevailed. SURROGATE settled of
the early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, reached even terms in midstretch, dueled outside of the winner to the wire
and just missed. LIGHTS OF BROADWAY raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide leaving the quarter pole and rallied outside. BIG BUCKSALOT
tracked the pace inside and lacked the needed stretch rally. A ROSE FOR RAVEN prompted the winner in three path and weakened in the lane. DENYING
failed to menace while racing four wide.

Footnotes
GRANTED SUCCESS broke out and bumped an outer foe, set the pace in the three path, tipped to the two path around the turn, was roused approaching
the quarter, dug in from the three path entering the stretch, drifted out slightly inside the final furlong, but held on. LAZZARONE got pinched at the start,
raced off the pace in the four path, ranged up in the six path around the turn, ran on from the five path into the stretch, bid in the final furlong, but hung for
place. ETRETAT stalked in the two path, was cued in the three path midway around the turn, tipped out to the four path into the stretch, but evened out for
show. ANTILLEAN hopped at the start and bumped an inner foe, tracked along the rail, was ridden in the two path around the turn, but flattened along the
inside in the stretch. DOC BALLARD chased in the four path, was under a heavy drive in the three path around the turn, and made no impact while back in
the four path down the lane. UNCAPTURED TIGER pressed in the five path, was urged between foes around the turn, but faded. COMMANDER BIZ
prompted the pace out in the six path but backed up turning into the stretch. TRAVEL GUIDE raced wellback in the seven path but did not threaten down the
center in the stretch. GOOD BUMP was hustled off the pace in the five path and never menaced. BIG ENVELOPE (IRE) trailed in the six path, pulled up
early into the turn, and was vanned off.
