Footnotes
BABY DRAGON broke sharply from the gate and sprinted clear soon after the start, increased her margin through the turn, then held through the lane under
steady pressure. HOT BODE allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out for clear
racing room, made a steady gain and edged up for the place. CALVARY KAT unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into
the stretch, made a steady gain, evened and missed the place. DREAMFUL hard to rated inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid three
wide outside the leader, then flattened out. ABBEY'S SNOW WHITE well placed and inside, angled out and held position two and three wide through the
turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded. KRISPY RICE was a brief factor, outside. BACKSTREET GAL mid pack and between, faded through the
turn.

Footnotes
QUARTERMASTER allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, angled out late and
drove clear. BIG CHICKEN MAN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then was no match late, while
clearly best of the rest. WORBOTHOR mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and closed well for the
show. OLDZFOURFORTYTWO reluctant to load, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, evened and gained a
share. WILD CARAMELO stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch
and weakened the final furlong. NICKY BEAR mid pack, gained position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and flattened
out. CHARLIE CHARLIE well placed and inside, moved up through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. FUTILE was
never involved. K'S LITTLE BILL broke sharply from the gate and was well placed outside, gained position on the two path through the turn, came four wide
into the stretch and had no rally.

CLOSETHEGAME SUGAR led in the early going, settled outside the leader, held position two and three wide through the turn, while being carried out
slightly by the leader, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear late. SURLY FURIOUS well placed and outside, held position on
the two path through the turn, came through inside a drifting leader, edging ahead, shook clear, then was no match for the winner late and held the place
safe. NIGHT TIME unhurried, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, then angled out further for clear racing room, made a
steady gain and missed the place. DIAMOND DUST hesitated at the start, rushed up to a clear lead while bearing out, drifted out slightly through the turn
and into the stretch, carrying the winner with him, then straightened and weakened the final furlong. ZOOMBIE unhurried, held position two and three wide
through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no rally. SOUPER SUCCESS well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came
through inside of rivals into the stretch and faded the final furlong.

Footnotes
BRUMBA WAFFLE TOES allowed to settle, angled out and moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady
gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then drew off under steady pressure. HEY PADRE angled out through the first turn to stalk the leader outside,
saved ground on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out and could not threaten the winner, holding the
place. STARSHIP EMPIRE set the pace on the outside, shook clear down the backstretch, drew off through the second turn, then was no match for the
winner the final furlong and held the show. E MINOR steadied slightly into the first turn, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on
that path into the stretch and evened out. TIZ TACT TOE allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came widest into the
stretch and passed tiring rivals. VAN well placed outside, dropped back after a half. CARLOUN (IRE) tracked the pace, then faded through the second turn.

stretch, angled out and got up for a share. JEN'S SONG allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the
