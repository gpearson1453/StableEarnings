Footnotes
AHSAD stalked the early pace and then went up to press the pace nearing the half mile marker, then dueled for the lead two wide on the turn, made a bid
leaving the quarter pole and slowly edged clear to prove best, driving. PARADISE PRIDE set the early pace while clear, then was pressed nearing the half
mile marker, then dueled to the inside of the winner on the turn and fought gamely to the wire but could not match strides with that rival in the lane, clearly
second best. GREYZER was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide on the backstretch, then was two wide by the quarter pole, angled out
off the turn and was no match for top two wide besting the rest. EL HERMANO hopped at the start and was off slowly, settled two to three wide and came
five wide into the lane and was not a threat. FIERCE WARRIOR tracked the pace three wide and stopped.

GOLDEN TABBY stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to gain a short lead by the quarter pole, then lost the crop by the furlong
marker and edged clear late under strong handling. AWESOME PIC tracked the early pace, made a four wide bid on the turn but was out-kicked in the
furlong grounds by the winner, second best. AWESOME VIEW tracked the pace on the inside, made a mild bid off the turn but needed more, bested rest.
MAINLINE was settled on the inside and had no rally. BEACH HOUSE chased the pace four wide and weakened. ABOVE THE LIMIT set the early pace
while clear off the inside and then gave way.

drew clear under right handed crop urging to prove much the best. SHARP TONES was void of early speed, swung out seven wide leaving the turn and
rallied well to be clearly second best. FINICKY was reserved early, advanced four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane, then lugged in under right
handed crop by the furlong marker and then got the show award late on the inside. GIVE IT A WHIRL tracked the pace three wide, made a three wide bid
on the turn to vie for command between rivals by the quarter pole but weakened in the drive, lost show award late. SPEEDYNESS got loose on the walk
over to the paddock, raced around the track with out incident, after inspection by the State Veterinarian, was cleared to run. Settled off the early pace,
flattened out through the stretch. MON GATEAU pressed the early pace on the outside, then vied for the lead between rivals two wide on the turn,
weakened. YAHOO OMAR set a pressured pace while on the inside and then weakened. THUNDER LAD was settled early on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
PROVIDING set the early pace while clear on the inside, drew off leaving the turn and was ridden out to prove much the best. PEACE PACT chased the
early pace in between rivals, angled out nearing the furlong marker and was up for the place award late. RAIN OF BLESSING tracked the pace and made a
mild bid four wide on the turn, proved to be no match for the winner and lost the place award late. SK'S HEART tracked the pace on the inside and
weakened. HOME TOWN FAV was settled early on the inside and lacked a rally. LADY AMANDA was reserved three wide and failed to respond.
