Footnotes
VAX A NATION , jostled at the break, quickly recovered and cleared, set a rated pace two to three wide, came under some coaxing past the five sixteenths,
repelled an outside bid from KING SWANSBORO entering the lane, shifted in briefly, responded to some firm left handed asks and drew away. KING
SWANSBORO rated towards the inside, edged up nearing the far turn, eased out with run nearing the quarter pole, ranged up to briefly threaten soon into
the lane, could not kick on with the winner but stayed on willingly to be well clear of the rest. SUCCEED settled four wide into and around the first turn, came
under a ride four wide past the three eighths, angled to the inside of a rival entering the stretch and faded. STORMY FIRE stumbled inward and soundly
bumped the winner, corrected and stalked that one three and four wide, was under pressure past the five sixteenths and weakened in upper stretch. TORO
FORWARD was outrun.

Footnotes
BODE'S MAKER , confidently handled three wide outside ELDEST SON, drew on near even terms near the three eighths, sparred in hand to the quarter
pole, responded when put to stout encouragement in upper stretch and powerfully moved away. ELDEST SON took over early and set the pace towards the
inside, was joined by the winner into the far turn, stayed on and battled under a ride into the lane, could not keep pace nearing mid stretch but stayed on
with effort and held down the place. IT'S VIPER saved ground and was within range early on, saw the leaders get away nearing the lane, swung out well
wide past the three sixteenths, finished up with good energy and gained the show. GILDED AGE rated forwardly two wide and between foes, had aim past
the five sixteenths, shifted out a bit for the drive but lacked a solid finish. FLAT OUT FLYING , a bit rank at the break, was not quite in rhythm with rider early
on while four deep, chased well wide past the five sixteenths, stayed on to mid stretch then gave way. IRISH BOOLUM , three wide between foes, stayed in
touch to the three eighths then faded.

AMERICAN UNITY eased back from between rivals into the first turn and angled out, rated forwardly four wide and spied the embattled leaders near the
half, bid three deep in hand leaving the far turn, took over heading towards the lane, kicked well clear after being put to strong asking, kept on under
energetic urging inside the sixteenth pole and held off ONE TEN. ONE TEN settled inside, edged up into the far turn, eased out for a clear run soon after,
advanced three wide into the stretch, shifted out a bit wider past the three sixteenths and closed gamely to gain. HUNTER JOE vied four wide outside a pair
of runners into the first turn, prompted the pace outside a rival through the backstretch run, gained a slim lead three furlongs out, could not contain the
winner approaching the stretch, shifted in and gave way. SOCIALLONGDISTANCE was hustled from the gate and gained command inside foes into the first
turn, spurted clear off the rail, was joined near the five eighths, battled to the far turn then faltered.

Footnotes
JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY came in slightly at the break and bumped with CRISPY CAT (GB), corrected and quickly moved up in hand to engage the leader
from the outside, disputed the issue in hand past the five sixteenths, went clear entering the lane, spurted away under a right handed ask leaving the three
sixteenths then held firm while steadily hand ridden the final sixteenth. COMMANDING GENERAL steadied off heels nearing the turn, angled out, circled
four to five wide into the stretch, straightened away and finished up gamely to be second best. WHENIGETTOHEAVEN had speed inside, eased back off
the leader approaching the turn, chased around the turn and faded. CRISPY CAT (GB) bobbled at the break then bumped with the winner, edged up three
wide into the turn to have aim, chased the leaders past the five sixteenths and weakened. SHIP THE GOODS took over between runners early, secured the
inside while joined by the winner into the turn, dueled, could not keep pace under pressure entering the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BOY MAGIC , up close behind three horses mid way on the turn, swung to the four path approaching the stretch, responded to mild urging in upper stretch,
gained command outside rivals inside the eighth pole and edged clear under confident handling. CATAHOULA MOON , three deep chasing the pace around
the turn, challenged for the lead between horses in mid stretch and continued gamely. ALWAYS A WARRIOR , two wide chasing the early pace, took the
lead and opened a clear advantage entering the stretch, was hooked in mid stretch and finished willingly inside the top pair. HIS RIGHTS lacked speed, was
three wide turning for home and showed mild, late interest. DANCE FOR GREEN bore out leaving the starting gate, failed to be a factor and swung to the
five path at the head of the stretch. CHAT BLANC stumbled when clipping the heels of DANCE FOR GREEN soon after the break then was outrun.
STREET TOUGH sped to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faltered in upper
stretch.

DANCINONTHEBEACH , brushed at the break, stalked off the inside, came five wide under asking into the lane, forged to command inside the furlong pole,
eagerly kicked clear and held firm while kept to task. GOLDEN CHARM eased back off the pace while saving ground, angled out around the turn, worked
through between runners past mid stretch and finished well. PUNKIN bumped with a rival soon after the break, rushed up between foes into the turn, raced
three wide mid turn pursuing the pace, shifted out leaving mid stretch and churned on. FORGOTTEN GIFT , bumped early on, angled in advancing into the
turn, moved up between foes near the stretch, shifted in past mid stretch and continued on while edged for the show. LENAMAGNETTA sped clear early,
drifted three wide into the turn, showed the way off the rail into the lane, could not resist the winner heading to the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly.
NICE BABY , off the pace and five wide mid turn, shifted out seven wide for the drive but failed to make an impact. VISUAL ILLUSION failed to menace.
PASSIONFORQUALITY was outrun. VIENNA'S TWIRL angled in nearing the turn, chased to upper stretch and faltered.
