Footnotes
REZASROLEX speed to the front well handled throughout to prevail at the wire. GAPPER within striking distance throughout with good energy to run on in
stretch just missed. REVENGE TOUR inside trip up close throughout to stay game in the final stages. ONORE rail trip to far turn with trouble into the stretch
and finished up well. CHEESESTEAK showed no early speed, ran on to contend throughout with a mild bid too late. ZHU DADDY bothered from the gate,
raced back with a bid far turn but faltered. VALERIE BLUE close up early on, raced along evenly from the half with no response from the far turn. AGENT
KOSTA broke well, up close to the half, gave in readily. ENGLISH BOBBY bothered at the start and slow into stride with no bid thereafter fading far back.
ROYALLY FLUSHED was through early and dropped well back. SWAYBACK JACK never factored throughout. Race was hand timed due to a bad sensor
on the turf course, all turf races will be hand timed for the remainder of the meet. Acm

Footnotes
MYTHOMANIA speed to duel, backed off at the half, came back, held sway wire. WARRIOR'S PLACE good effort from inside to far turn, slow grind stretch
coming on. RED CHEEKS raced along evenly to far turn with a mild run for show spot. LIAMS LAD inside run first turn in tight, lost position, improved late.
HABITUS shuffled back, kicked into gear far turn split horses improved. SOUTHERN BREEZE rushed into first turn to clear, led to far turn, gave in stretch.
PAINTSVILLE tried to keep up outside to far turn, gave in through the stretch. LOLAS BEAU broke tardy while always well back througout. NEAP TIDE
through early with a steady fade throughout. CANTSTOPTHEFUN never menaced throughout. Race was hand timed due to a bad sensor on the turf
course, all turf races will be hand timed for the remainder of the meet. Acm
