Footnotes
CONSIDER ME gained a narrow lead along the inside soon after the start, gave up the advantage after a quarter, dropped back a bit on the turn, came on
again under right handed urging to make the lead near the furlong marker and edged clear late under strong handling. UNCAPTURED LYON pressured the
winner two wide, made the lead after a quarter, set the pace into the stretch and held on for second. KILLER BEE trailed down the backstretch then closed
fast along the rail through the stretch. MINDSHIP Q stalked the pace and went evenly in the five path. PRIVATE CONNIE well placed, failed to respond.
DOMI was no threat. KRAZY HAWK was outrun. I'M NO SLEEPY JOE was no factor.
