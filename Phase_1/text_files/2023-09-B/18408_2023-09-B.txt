SHE'S AWESOME prompted the pace four wide early, took over when ready on the turn then pulled away under moderate coaxing. CAST YOUR NET
dueled between rivals then pursued inside, was no threat to the winner while easily second best. COOKIE BANK dropped back wide then advanced wide to
gain the show. THEARCHERORTHEPREY chased along the inside and lacked a solid rally. CHARLIZE CHUB broke alertly then dropped back and was
never a factor. CHANCE OCCURRENCE flashed speed along the rail then began fading on the turn. LOST IN THOUGHT dueled between rivals in the
opening quarter then gave way.

BOSSYNESS forced the pace inside, moved out on the turn, angled inside leader in midstretch and wore down that pacesetter in the final yards. DENALI
RAE vied outside, pulled away on the turn, drifted out in the stretch and was nailed nearing the wire. DANCING ON MY OWN was reserved close up inside
then narrowed the gap through the stretch without threatening. SHETALKSTOMUCH lagged far behind, chased inside and failed to menace. RUNNIN
REDBIRD lacked speed, was asked for run on the turn and failed to respond. I'M NERVOUS NOW prompted the pace three wide then was finished midway
on the turn.

HEY PORTER rated off the pace, swung wide advancing into the stretch then bid clear in the final furlong. RON DON SCORESE prompted the pace three
wide, rallied in the stretch but was outfinished. WE READY raced just off the leaders in the two path and conrtnued well to the finish. HORNBEAM settled
just behind the leaders outside then flattened out in the stretch. INDOCTRINATE alternated for the advantage outside, led in midstretch and weakened.
JACOHARE angled inside dueling for the lead then was finished by three quarters. CARIBBEAN (AUS) trailed early then passed tiring rivals. SENIOR

turn and continued well. PURRFECT MISTRESS raced off the path in the two path and closed well late. GAVICHI trailed early then offered some late
energy near the inside. STARSHIP BLANCA dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. SNOW FORECAST earned a narrow advantage
inside then gave way in the stretch. SIZZLING ROMA broke slowest, moved wide to contention and flattened out. LEVIOSA dropped off the pace outside
and weakened steadily. SMOOTH AS GLASS raced within range down the backstretch and retreated. MAZAL EIGHTEEN flashed speed along the inside
then gave way readily.

LANSDOWNE vied outside in the opening quarter, shook loose on the turn, widened and remained safe under steady urging. CAUSES TROUBLE pressed
the winner from the inside, pursued that rival on the turn and continued gamely to the wire. DIXIE'S TWO STENTS saved ground throughout, chased under
urging and was no threat. GET SET dropped back outside, remained wide and lacked a solid rally. POLAR WIND broke slowly and trailed far behind then
caught weakening rivals. MANOLITO raced between rivals in the second flight and faltered. LORD UHTRED hustled three wide off the pace and began
fading on the turn.

YOUNG SQUIRE dueled three then two wide, led narrowly from the quarter pole to the wire and held on determinedly. BUFF HELLO vied for the advantage
four wide and continued well but could not get by the winner. GAME SEVEN advanced strongly very wide on the turn and made a gradual late gain.
MCCRAKENS GHOST chased behind wall of dueling leaders and made slight stretch gain. UNCLE DAR angled out advancing on the turn, angled back in
through the stretch and flattened. WINDSOR GOLD dropped back despite urging early and was never a factor. TIZ SPEEDY trailed for half mile outside
then caught pair of tiring rivals. GO EAST dueled between rivals in the two path and stopped on the turn. AMIGOS GUITAR flashed speed along the inside
with a slight lead then gave way.
