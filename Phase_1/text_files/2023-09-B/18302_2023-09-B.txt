THISAINTJUMPSTREET well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and drove
clear. GLOVANNA allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, moved up and was blocked into the stretch, waited, came through inside of rivals,
angled three wide when clear, made a steady gain and closed the gap on the winner late, edging for the place. ANNIE UP BUCK tracked the pace, saved
ground through the turns, angled out and bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, angled out further for clear racing room and was outfinished for
the place. TREASURE THE STORM sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the furlong marker, then weakened and held a share. KEYPIT
sent from the gate, stalked the leader to the second turn and faded through the turn. CLASSY HALO was never involved.

gain, dueled the final furlong and edged up in the final strides. SCIENCE TO WIN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged
into the stretch, dueled the final furlong and was outfinished. SILVER TOKEN unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into
the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. ASPLUNDER tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the
stretch and had a mild gain. GOLDEN OAK passed a tiring rival. PUNX never far back, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into

IDLE CHATTER tracked the pace rating, saved ground through the turns, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off inside the
furlong marker. REACTIVE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then was no match for the winner the
final furlong and held the place. VANA BRIGHT unhurried, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and closed well for
the show. RIA FORMOSA rated in the early going, angled out and pulled to contention down the backstretch, gained position on the two path through the
second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not match strides with that one and weakened. BACK ON STAGE was a brief factor.

Footnotes
NOT ORBINARY unhurried, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain, angled four
wide, split foes inside the furlong marker and edged up in the final strides. WINDY CITY GIRL mid pack, looped two and three wide through the turn, fanned
widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. DANCE OR STROLL rated mid pack, looped up three and four wide through
the turn, came four wide into the stretch, evened and held the show. ROLLING MO tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of
rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then could not sustain the bid and held a share. ODD GAL well placed and
outside, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and faded late. THE TWO NANCY'S sprinted to a clear lead soon
after the start, held sway to the furlong marker and faded. TAPIT RIGHT was never involved.

GENERAL WINSTON mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead
late and held. WOODCHUCK chassed the pace, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, evened and gained the
place. CALL ME LATER stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch,
then weakened late and held the show. SOGNO DI CAMPIONE (CHI) set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then was
no match late and held a share. THE SINNER IS YOU passed tiring rivals, inside. GINS AND TINS allowed to settle, moved up four wide through the turn,
then ran evenly in the stretch. MAJOR WAGER was no factor.

Footnotes
SALLY'S MUSTANG rated mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled three wide, made a steady gain
and edged up late. TWISTED TREASURE unhurried, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain,
was blocked late, angled three wide, split foes and got up for the place. SUMTING RIGHT sprinted away from the field in the early going, increased her
margin to the second turn, stayed on when challenged at the furlong pole, then weakened late and held the show. NEVISIAN SPIRIT well placed, saved
ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, then flattened the final furlong. LIGHTNING ROUND allowed to settle,
looped three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, closed through traffic and passed tiring rivals. LEAD PERFORMER hopped at the
start, looped up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, then faded final furlong. LOOKING FOR LOVE
fractious in the gate, gained position three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and had no rally. TUDOX RUE MAJESTIC
tracked the pace well back, lost some ground on the two path through the second turn, then faded into the stretch.
