Footnotes
WMA SMOKE SIGNAL was unhurried leaving the gate then was rated along the inside into the turn, advanced while two wide to edge clear heading into the
stretch and held sway till the end. SAINT SILKIE AA angled in towards the rail to duel briefly with WMA BADGE then took command heading into the turn,
was in a long drive then faltered in the early stretch and was best for second place. CONSEQUENTLY chased the pace from the inside mid pack, then bid
on the turn to gain third position heading into the stretch and raced evenly throughout. WMA BADGE dueled briefly in the early furlong then settled back and
stalked the pace setter into the turn under a strong drive then flattened out in the stretch. WMA NORTH WIND was unhurried early and no factor.
