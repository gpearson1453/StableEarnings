LIKE A SALTSHAKER set the pace from the outset, raced near the rail into the lane, was confidently handled in the upper stretch and put away foes quickly
after while drawing away in the final stages. JUNIOR BUG trailed the field early on, was in the four path into the lane and rallied down the lane for place in
the late stages while no match for the winner. SANTA CRUISER stalked the pace early, raced in the three path into the lane and flattened out late in the
stretch run. VIOLENT GIGI tracked the pace early along the inside, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. RISK PROFILE was
a tad slow at the break, chased the pace early, raced in the five path into the lane and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
DEL RAYO raced along the inside in the first turn and tracked the early pace, shifted into the three path entering the lane, made a bid in the stretch, split
horses near the eighth pole and drew away while geared down in the late stages. RUNLIKECARL was bothered entering the first turn and raced back early
on, was in the four path into the lane, lugged a bit in the upper stretch, made a three wide bid but was no match late for winner and prevailed for place.
YULETIDE GALLOP set the pace early, raced off the rail into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. THE RUSH IS ON raced between horses along
the first turn, chased the early pace, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. MOR JAZZ raced four wide along the first turn
while unhurried, was widest into the lane and improved position in the stretch. MASTER SWITCH raced three wide along the first turn, was in the three path
into the lane while through after a half. PATCH O'BRIEN stalked the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane and empty down the lane.

STRETCH RIDE stalked the pace early, raced in the three path into the lane, rallied late in the stretch and drove past the leader in the final stages. AGOO
tracked the pace early three wide, was in the four path into the lane, the rider lost the whip nearing the three sixteenths pole while making a bid, took over
and inched clear inside the eighth pole but was caught in the final stages. NO JUDGMENT chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, made a
bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. HANDSOME HERB was a tad slow at the start, set the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane, under
a long drive down the lane, gave in near the sixteenth pole and yielded late. NYQUIST FREQUENCY raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane
and moved up late in the stretch run. ANDY'S CANDY was a bit slow at the start and never a threat. MAX'S MAP chased the pace early, was off the rail into
the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. WITH FULL HONORS was a bit slow at the start and never a factor. MIDNIGHT MAESTRO trailed the field
throughout.

Footnotes
CHANCE was a tad slow at the break, chased the pace early near the inside, was taken into the five path entering the lane, rallied down the lane and edged
clear three wide in the final stages. FASHION KING chased the pace early, raced in the five path into the lane, rallied in the stretch, made a bid from
between horses but hung in the final stages. PASS LINE tracked the pace early, took over command, was in the three path into the lane, inched clear in the
stretch but yielded late in the drive. ENOUGH ALREADY broke slowly and trailed the field early on, was in the seven path into the lane and moved up in the
stretch run. ALILNALOT stalked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. DREAMWITHINADREAM raced back
early on, was in the six path into the lane and improved position in the stretch. JAY BIRD was done early. SPANISH DOUBLOON set the pace early, was on
the inside into the lane and gave way down the lane. USAIN was keen early on and through after a half.
