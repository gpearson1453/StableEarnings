Footnotes
RED HOT CHICK raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the stretch, rallied between horses in the lane, split foes in deep stretch and surged late
between rivals to get up at the wire. PIMENOVA raced off the pace with a ground saving trip throughout, split foes at the top of the lane, rallied to a short
lead past the furlong marker, dug in gamely on the rail and just missed. JUDGEMENT TIME stalked close up two wide, then pressed the pace, bid on the far
turn, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely three wide in the final furlong and battled on to the end. QUEEN DEYMAR was bumped and off slowly, raced off
the pace, three wide on the backside, chased four wide on the far turn and finished evenly. REBEL CONSORT raced two wide off the pace, chased on the
far turn, came four wide into the stretch and finished evenly. FEARLESS KRISTIE raced off the pace with an inside trip and finished evenly in the two path.
CAPTURE THIS set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn, dug in on the rail in the stretch and weakened late. OSCAR GAZE was off slowly, trailed
and did not factor.
