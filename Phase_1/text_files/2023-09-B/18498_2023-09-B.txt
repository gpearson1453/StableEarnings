Footnotes
VICTOR'S DEAL stalked the early pace from the fence, moved between rivals down the backside to engage the leader, took command midway on the turn
and drew off as much best. FORWHOMTHEBELLTOLL unhurried for the first half mile, commenced a rally into the final bend and steadily closed ground to
garner the place. LOOKIN AT JUSTICE tracked the leaders from the rail saving ground and made a mild late bid up the fence down the lane. BRIGHT
BRIAN took the lead from the gate, set a well rated pace and weakened when challenged on the far turn. UNBRIDLED VICTOR raced three wide down the
backside in striking position and continued one-paced failing to mount a rally. OH SO SOCIAL prompted the pace from three wide through the final bend
and weakened in the stretch. GO NUTS was never a factor.

INCREDIBLE JUSTICE hustled early to keep with the pack, settled two wide to track the pacesetters, ranged up four wide turning for home and wore the
pacesetter down through the lane. CORSIDAT showed speed up the fence to duel on the lead to the turn, continuously tried to get out on the turn bumping
DEEP DISH, cleared that rival turning for home while being held in by her rider, responded when challenged in mid-stretch and drifted out considerably
when passed by the winner while still holding the place. OCELIA slow early to trail the field, rallied three wide at the head of the lane, angled inside down the
lane and finished willingly. DEEP DISH pressed from two wide dueling on the lead, was bumped by CORSIDAT in the turn, continued to duel to the quarter
pole and gave way down the stretch. TATTERED HEART chased the pace from the rail and failed to mount a bid. SHAPE OF YOU stalked the pace from
three wide to the top of the stretch and flattened out.

KEEN ICE SIGHT prompted the pace to the turn, engaged the leader nearing the quarter pole, quickly opened a clear advantage and finished convincingly
having no threats in the lane. PALAGO a step slow away from the gates, was patiently handled early, commenced a rally turning for home and made a
steady advance down the stretch to take the place. QUIET DAWN raced off to open a clear lead in the first quarter mile, could not go with the winner when
challenged turning for home and kept on down the lane to hold the show. GO STORMIN GIRL tracked the pace to the turn, rallied up the rail through the
bend and flattened out in the stretch. INDAWIN stalked the pace for a half and faded. PALACE MAGIC was never a factor.

Footnotes
DADDYS DREAM pressed the pace the entire way from two wide, dueled with the runner-up through the lane and pulled clear late. SECRET'S IMAGE set a
pressured pace for the first half, dueled with the winner through the final bend and down the stretch, was outkicked late but finished well in a good effort.
KNIGHT'S MOVE unhurried to be near the rear of the field to the far turn and rallied well to be up for the show. HE B READY stalked the pace from the
fence to the top of the lane and failed to mount a closing rally. HIGHEST MEMORIES slow early to trail the field to the head of the lane and passed weaker
rivals down the stretch. LAST OUTLAW tracked the pace to the far turn and faded coming home. EPIC THE LEGEND was caught wide through the first
turn, continued on the outside down the backstretch and failed to menace. HE GOES FOREVER was caught wide into the first turn and raced near the rear
most of the way as a non-threat.

Footnotes
A STAR FOR CORA stalked the pace for the first three quarters from two wide, assumed command at the head of the lane and finished well not having
been threatened in the drive. LA VILLAGE LUMIERE was caught three wide through the first turn in mid-pack, rallied into the far turn circling five wide at the
top of the lane, loomed in upper stretch but never gained on the winner. TOUR DE' PORT bumped slightly leaving the gate, was taken in hand to be near
the rear of the field, mounted a steady rally turning for home and closed well to be up for the show and gaining at the wire. RAZZALUNA rated off the pace
while racing between horses into the far turn, mounted a bid midway on the turn to threaten in the stretch but could not close the gap. STUPENDOUS
bumped rival leaving the gate, raced along the fence in striking distance to the head of the stretch and failed to gain down the lane. WILMA never seriously
menaced and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. FLAT OUT FAY tracked the pacesetter from three wide through the both turns and weakened turning for
home. HOP SNIP ANDA JUMP set the pace for three quarters and gave way. NIXA was always outrun.

NIGHT KISS pressed the pace from three wide down the backside, ranged up on the turn to quickly take control, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch
and held on late. LONG BLACK VEIL prominently placed along the rail to duel on the early lead, dropped back to stalk through the turn and came on again
to be gaining late. LOVE DRUNK reserved off the pace to the turn, rallied in the turn while fanned seven wide turning for home and closed well down the
lane. C F V TU BRUTUS broke awkwardly to be at the rear, gained ground through the turn and mounted a bid splitting rivals in the stretch. IRISH TAP
stalked the pace from two wide to the top of the lane and failed to close ground. PERFECT SMOKEY EYE sped to the lead from between horses, dueled
briefly in the turn and tired coming home. XTRASAUCEWELLDONE broke slow to be near the back and was never a threat. DREAM TRAP raced four wide
between rivals in the turn in striking position and flattened out at the head of the stretch.

HURRY UP HANNAH reserved off the pace for the first half mile, rallied up the fence cutting the corner to surge to the lead at the top of the lane and drew
off as much best. MISCHIEF LILY raced near the rear of the field down the backside, moved up between horses into the turn, angled in toward the rail for
the drive and closed well. SOUL HEIR pressed the pace to the far turn, assumed command to the head of the stretch and weakened in the drive. BECK
AND CALL slow early to trail the pack, circled seven wide at the top of the lane and mounted a belated rally in the lane. SCATLIE tracked the leaders from
three wide, made a bid in the turn and flattened out. SUN VALLEY ROAD saved ground near the back along the fence and never menaced while passing
weaker rivals in the lane. VIDEO PRINCESS mounted a mild bid in upper stretch and finished evenly. TIGER TAP well placed in striking distance along the
fence and faded coming home. LILY'S HOME prompted the pace for three quarters and gave way turning for home. SHIRL'S DELIGHT set the pace under
pressure from the rail to the far turn and stopped.
