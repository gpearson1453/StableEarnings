CARLA'S HONOR stalked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, launched her bid two wide entering the final
turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive to get up in time. NINE OCLOCK CEASER away well and raced to the lead from along the rail in the run
to the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of TAM TRICKY in the run down the backside, continued to battle with that rival through the final turn,
but was unable to fend off a late surge by CARLA'S HONOR while proving clearly second best. TOBESUNNY unhurried early while dropping back to trail in
the run to the first turn, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside, commenced her bid four wide entering the final turn, and
finished with late interest three wide in the drive to get up for a share. ISLAND LIVING away alertly and was allowed to settle off the contested pace while
racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, mounted a two wide bid entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing at the rail in
the lane. TAM TRICKY broke sharply and pressed the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, continued to force the issue two wide in the
run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on his pace rival leaving the turn, and weakened in the stretch drive. STRIKING
VALUE stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, struggled to maintain her position in the run to the final turn, and
had little to offer when called upon.

MAJESTIC STREET away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the inside of two rivals in
the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, shook clear of his pace rivals leaving the turn, and was all out to repel the late challenge from
KNOPFLER while drifting three wide under left handed urging. KNOPFLER broke sharply and stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing
one out from the rail, began to advance two wide from between rivals midway down the backstretch, rallied smartly four wide through the final turn, and
closed steadily three out from the rail in the drive to just miss. DRILLER tracked the battling leaders while saving ground along the inside in the run down the
backstretch, rallied from along the inside through the final turn while awaiting room, and closed from along the inside in the drive to garner a share.
ANOTHER GUINNESS unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, rallied three wide from the back of the pack entering the final turn, and
continued three wide in the drive while improving his position. RING OF KERRY away alertly and pressed the pace three wide in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival leaving the turn, and was outfinished late. I'M A CHI TOO dueled for the
lead from between rivals in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, struggled to keep tabs on his pace rival leaving the turn, and faded in the
stretch drive. FRANKIE MACHINE stalked the contested early pace while racing two wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide into the final
turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

TIZ MEOW broke sharply and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace on an uncontested lead in the run down the
backside, maintained a clear lead through the final turn, and widened his advantage late while under confident handling. BODEGA away alertly and tracked
the leader in the run down the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, commenced his bid from just off the rail entering the final turn, and closed
two wide in the drive to prove easily second best. VALUE MAX away well and stalked the pacesetter in the run down the backstretch while racing two out
from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to garner a share. TIMELESS SHRUG unhurried early while trailing
the field into the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive, but was only able to pass a tiring rival.

pressed the pacesetter two wide through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and through the

backside, engaged the leaders three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to sustain his bid in the late going. NEIGHBOR settled off the early pace
while saving ground through the stretch the first time, commenced his bid from along the rail entering he final turn, and finished from along the rail in the

ABOVE AVERAGE away alertly and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position through the second turn
and into the backstretch, collared the pacesetter midway down the backside, and battled with that rival through the final turn and into the lane, began to get
the better of her pace rival in mid stretch, and inched clear late while laying in under left handed urging. AIR FORCE away well and raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace through the second turn and into the backstretch, battled from the inside of ABOVE AVERAGE through
the final turn and into the stretch, steadied in mid stretch when losing her path, and finished just out from the rail late while holding the place. MATSQUI
stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained her position through the second turn and in the run down the
backside, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, and shifted three wide entering the lane, and closed two out from the rail in the drive to garner a
share. JAMIES INHERITANCE broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time,
was called on to keep up while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed six wide in the drive. KEY TO
SUCCESS stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backstretch,
rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more while finishing four wide in the drive. FORCE TO REKN WITH settled off the early pace while
saving ground along the inside entering the stretch the first time, held her position into the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was
unable to mount a serious late bid while finishing five wide in the drive. ARUNDEL CASTLE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well
back and failed to make a late impact. Following the running of this race, there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of AIR FORCE lodged a claim of foul
against the rider of ABOVE AVERAGE for alleged interference in mid stretch. Ater review, the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the
original order of finish

Footnotes
ACCIDENTAL HERO tracked the leaders into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position into the backstretch,
launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, collared SUNBIRD midway through the turn, and prevailed over that stubborn rival in the closing strides
while finishing three out from the rail. SUNBIRD away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the
inside of IT'S A FACT through the stretch the first time and in the run down the backstretch, got the better of his pace rival soon after entering the final turn,
but was quickly collared by ACCIDENTAL HERO, and just failed to last. SPACE broke sharply and tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time,
maintained his position through the second turn and in the run down the backside, rallied smartly from along the rail through the final turn, and finished from
along the rail in the drive to prove easily best of the rest. KYSTONE settled at the back of a compact field entering the stretch the first time, was pushed
along mid way down the backside, rallied smartly three wide entering he final turn, but was unable to sustain his early run in the lane. IT'S A FACT away
well and dueled for the lead from the outside of SUNBIRD entering the first turn, continued to force the issue two wide through the second turn and in the
run down the backside, chased the pacesetter into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
QUAGMIRE away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backside and into the final turn, and prevailed in the final strides over a very stubborn pace rival. VALUABLE COWBOY away well and dueled for the lead
from the outside of QUAGMIRE entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and continued to
do battle with that foe through the lane, and just missed. WISE MARKET stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied two
wide entering the final turn, and closed two out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. FOOT SOLDIER broke sharply and stalked the leaders one out
from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, was pushed out entering the lane, and closed four wide in the drive.
MORETHANSOULTITLE settled off the contested early pace while racing two wide entering the backstretch, commenced his bid four wide entering the final
turn, but was unable to mount a serious late bid while finishing five wide in the drive. CALAMAZEUS settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, steadied briefly when in tight quarters leaving the turn, and finished from along the
rail in the drive. BARNEY GOOGLE unhurried early while dropping well behind the field entering the first turn, was always well behind, and gained ground
late, but failed to make a late impact. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of FOOT SOLDIER lodged a claim of
foul against the rider of WISE MARKET for alleged interference entering the stretch. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made
to the original order of finish.
