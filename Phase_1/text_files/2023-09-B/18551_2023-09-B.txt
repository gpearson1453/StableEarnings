NAME THE PRICE moved to a clear early lead, was challenged into the far turn, dug in through the lane and kept PHLASH DRIVE safe to the wire.
PHLASH DRIVE bid three wide outside the winner into the lane but could not get by. JUDGE'S BRIBE was in reach of the pace two or three wide, angled
out into the lane to bid but could not get to the top pair. FOR REEL saved ground and made a mild late bid. KENHEDOIT was in reach three to four wide
and lacked a final closing run. BARTENDERS MISTAKE failed to mount a rally three wide. no factor. L B GOLD dropped back three or four wide, angled in
going to the far turn but was not a factor. J PS HARLEY GLIDER stumbled at the break, dropped back going to the first turn and pulled up on the
backstretch then walked off under his own power.
