Footnotes
TEN GAUGE moved close up outside, took over at the five sixteenths pole and edged away under steady encouragement. TRAFFIC MASTER saved
ground off the pace then finished willingly to gain the place. LEASE broke alertly and hustled to the front then came again in midstretch then weakened.
EXIT RIGHT rated behind wall of pacesetters, moved wide on the final turn and stretch tiring. SWING LOW lagged far behind then offered late energy
without threatening. EGOT A POKER FACE prompted the pace for three quarters then gave way readily. GLIDING AFLEET chased four wide off the
leaders and faded on the final turn. OCCASIONAL MOON settled off the pace outside then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
HOLLYWOOD JET broke alertly and took control, extended his margin in the stretch and stayed safe under steady urging. WORD ON A WING saved
ground off the leaders, swung very wide into the stretch and closed with good determination. SCARAMOUCHE raced in close pursuit of the winner then
flattened out in the stretch. BEREN chased off the pace outside, moved very wide on the turn, angled in through the stretch but lacked a bid. AGGRANDIZE
raced three wide in striking range to midstretch then weakened. ONE MORE SCOOP broke slowly, trailed very wide and was never a factor.

PERFECT SILENT CAT well back early, advanced wide and ran down the pacesetter in the final furlong and pulled clear. AVA K'S BOY dueled inside
opening quarter, shook loose on the turn and weakened. PORSUPUESTO trailed far behind, rallied extremely wide in the stretch and closed. RACK GIN
lacked speed outside, bid very wide on the turn and had only a mild rally. MISCHIEVOUS JONES dropped back along the inside then caught fading
opponents. DANGNABBIT saved ground while outrun early and lacked a rally. REFUND RIGLER flashed speed along the inside to the far turn and stopped.
CENTER MID MADDIE fractious in the gate prior to start, forced the pace outside and gave way. LUCKY AS A SEVEN raced in midpack then began
faltering on the turn.
