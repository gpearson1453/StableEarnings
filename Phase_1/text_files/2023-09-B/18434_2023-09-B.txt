MIDNIGHT SILENCE stalked in the three path, challenged from outside with three furlongs remaining, took over late on the far turn, cleared at the top of the
lane, remained clear to the sixteenth pole and held. BOGINSKAYA broke out, chased three wide at the back into the first turn, got boxed in three deep on
the far turn, continued three wide into the lane, chased after the winner through the lane, put in a late bid but was not enough. DORINE'S WILD CAT
traveled along the inside off the pace, moved off the inside and into range in the middle stages, chased between rivals in the two path on the far turn, moved
to the inside in the stretch and finished evenly late. ROUND IN CIRCLES showed keen early speed while in the two path, set the pace to the far turn,
challenged at the three-eighths pole, gave up command leaving that bend and weakened. GEEJAYTEE broke out, tracked four wide early, went four deep
into the second bend, spun five wide into the lane and weakened. FAST INVESTMENT forwardly placed on the inside early, coaxed around the second
bend continuing to hug the rail, moved out in upper stretch and tired.

from outside, inched ahead at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command near the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. DRIZELLA was unprepared and tossed
her head at the start, trailed on the inside to the stretch and failed to menace. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT DRIZELLA

Footnotes
JUST A LITTLE LUCK vied for the lead between rivals, inched ahead into the turn, shook free past the quarter pole and was ridden out. MODERA became
fractious in the gate, chased from inside then two wide into the turn, climbed around the bend, moved out in the final furlong and gained second. R GIRL'S
WERTH IT broke out and bumped rival, pressed from inside, fought with the winner to the quarter pole, could not go on with that rival after and flattened to
third. ILA VEIW TOO pressed three deep between rivals then chased three wide into the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and weakened. MANGO
MOON vied four deep then three deep leaving the backstretch, chased the top pair past the three-eighths pole and faded. HOUSE OF TARGARYEN took a
bump from inside at the start, climbed a bit early, chased two then three wide at the back on the turn before angling out into the lane and failed to menace.
DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE FIFTH RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

DUTY FIRST stalked from inside, challenged entering the lane, took over at the quarter pole, kicked clear from outer rival, asked a few times right handed at
the eighth pole and was ridden out to the wire. LOGON TO WIN raced up close early, had to check between rivals entering the turn, angled out and came
five wide into the stretch and rallied for the place honors. CRIBBAGE BOARD set the tone up the backstretch, led three wide into the lane, lost command
with a quarter mile left to run and flattened to third. QUINCEY traveled near the back off the rail, angled into the two path early on the bend, came back out
approaching the stretch and kept on to round out the superfecta. THE LAST ONE PERK broke a step slow, moved inside for the turn, spun three wide into
the stretch and lacked a rally. MOON ICE tracked off the rail, angled to the inside for the turn, steered back out entering the lane and weakened. FORDY G
pressed from outside up the backstretch, chased three to four wide on the turn and weakened. SMILING RULER broke a step slow, climbed early on, trailed
four wide into the drive and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
SEAHAWK MARY bumped on both sides at the start, went up to duel outside JUST IS, cleared that rival leaving the turn, drifted out in the lane and was
kept to task to the wire. RYDER'S CANDY bumped inner rival early, settled off the rail, went two to three wide around the bend, angled out in upper stretch
and rallied for second. JUST IS bumped leaving the gate, dueled for command from inside, failed to kick on with the winner leaving the bend and came off
the rail, stayed on through the lane and got edged for the place approaching the wire. HEY DEMPS brushed inner rival, pressed three deep between foes
up the backstretch, chased the leaders three then four wide on the turn and could not rally in the lane. YVETT'S SURPRISE broke a step slow from outside,
went four then five wide on the turn, improved position in the lane but failed to threaten. ILLHAVEANOTHERKISS raced up close four deep between then
chased leaving the backstretch, angled to the rail on the turn and weakened down the lane. MAGIC SECRET got bumped from outside early, went up to vie
five then four deep for the lead, chased four to five wide around the bend and weakened. YALEO got bothered leaving the gate, chased along the inside into
the turn, tipped out past the five-sixteenths pole and came up empty in the stretch run.
