well off the pace inside, swung very wide into the stretch rallying too late. ADDYSON'S DREAM was urged off the leaders along the rail and continued well
to the finish. CHILLING HASSLE alternated for the lead with trio of rivals for half a mile then faded late. POKER PARTNER prompted the pace between foes
and was finished by the quarter pole. STANDPOINT vied three wide between foes, drifted wider on the turn and faded. I CAN DO MAGIC chased very wide
down the backstretch and lacked a response. BAD BAD MR. BROWN trailed far behind then caught a stopping rival. CRAIGH NA DUN dropped back three
wide between rivals and stopped.

AOIFE'S MAGIC rated close up, slipped through to the front midway on the turn then drew away in the stretch under steady urging. NOISY ON THE BAY
trailed far behind then advanced extremely wide and closed well to gain place. LUCKY OPPORTUNITY lacked speed, moved very wide on the turn, angled
inside in the stretch. SIRANI forced the pace three wide then lost position in the stretch. NORMANDY LIFE settled four wide just off the pace and flattened
out in the stretch. JODY'S RUBY chased near the inside and lacked a response. STEAL THE DEAL broke very slowly and was never in contention. BETSY
IS THE GAL forced the pace inside in the opening quarter then gave way readily. ONE EYED JACKIE led narrowly outside then was finished after half a
mile.

final turn, proved no match then was eased in the final stages costing the place. FOREWARNED dropped far behind then continued willingly in the stretch.
FOWLER BLUE chased off the leaders inside rival and faded on the final turn. CALIBRATE moved outside within striking range for a mile and gave way.
SUIGU STAR trailed far behind throughout losing contact with his field.

SMOOTH B pressed the winner from the start, bid closer on the turn and continued gamely to the finish. ROSES FOR DEBRA raced just off the pace in the
two path then went evenly through the stretch. FIVE DREAMS advanced five wide on the turn and finished willingly. ALEXIS S dropped far behind then
showed late energy while no threat. DETERMINED KINGDOM saved ground just behind the leaders and proved empty in the stretch. SURPRISE BOSS
bumped about early, trailed far behind then caught fading rivals. JUST JEREMY bumped about early, raced off the pace and lacked a rally. ALL THAT
MAGIC flashed speed three wide then came up empty in the stretch. PATRIARCH ARTIE broke very slowly, rushed up inside then faded.

NIMITZ CLASS settled off the pace three wide, crept closer on the final turn, dueled to the final furlong and clear while kept to his task. GUNITE pursued the
loose pacesetter in hand, led on the final turn, was challenged by the winner and outfinished. MISH hustled to a clear advantage to the final turn, was
collared by pair of rivals and came up empty. DR B broke slowest, chased outside under urging on the final turn and weakened. CIVIL WAR lacked speed
inside and failed to respond. DR ARDITO dropped back early inside and trailed nearly the entire trip.

Footnotes
DAMON'S MOUND well placed behind the dueling leaders, angled out and bid three wide on the turn, repelled a challenge in midstretch and outdueled rival
through the final furlong. NAUTICAL STAR settled outside, advanced four wide on the turn moving with the winner, loomed a stretch threat but was
outfinished. GORDIAN KNOT dropped back outside, moved extremely wide on the turn and stretch with late energy. NINETYPRCENTMADDIE saved
ground under urging, angled out on the turn and finished well. RYVIT vied outside, led briefly between calls on the turn then weakened in the stretch.
DREAMING OF KONA settled off the pace in the two path then drifted wide on the turn fading. DEPOLI lacked speed, saved ground under strong urging
and was no factor. PRAETORIAN GUARD lagged far behind throughout and passed a stopping rival. SIR LANCELOT led narrowly under pressure to the
three eighths pole and stopped while not asked in the late stages.

Footnotes
SAUDI CROWN broke alertly and sent right to the front, rated on clear lead, repelled challenges and widened again in midstretch and held on with
determination. DREAMLIKE far back early inside, angled wide advancing on the final turn then made a gradual gain in the final furlong. IL MIRACOLO
chased wide, made a menacing bid into the far turn then flattened out late. MAGIC TAP settled close up inside, remained within range inside then weakened
late. CRUPI squeezed back early, advanced inside, steadied in midstretch and weakened. REINCARNATE hustled just off the pace four wide, bid at the
three eighths pole and lacked a further response. GILMORE edged close near the inside after half a mile then faltered. DAYDREAMING BOY made a
menacing wide run on the final turn then gave way. WEST COAST COWBOY chased just off the pace between rivals then stopped after half a mile.
SCOTLAND prompted the pace between foes in the two path and stopped at the three eighths pole. MODERN ERA lagged far behind throughout losing
contact with his field. A claim of foul by the fourth finisher against the third finisher for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

BOSS LIKE BETH close up from the start, bid on the turn, led narrowly in midstretch and held on gamely. DECOUPAGE chased between foes early, moved
wide in the stretch and rallied. BEACH DAZE lacked speed then finished full of run through the final furlong. COMEDY ACT set pressured pace inside, was
collared into the stretch and weakened. CONFIRMED GENIUS prompted the leader inside then faltered on the turn. SHERO moved to contention wide at
the quarter pole then tired late. OUR UPTOWN GIRL offered six wide middle move on the turn then faded. CABRA CHICA saved ground off the pace then
passed fading rivals. GLORY DIA lacked speed and was never in contention. FINE WHINING forced the pace to midway on the turn and gave way.
PRACTICALITY was taken up inside on the turn and had no further response. WICKED SIGHT steadied along on the turn and gave way readily.
