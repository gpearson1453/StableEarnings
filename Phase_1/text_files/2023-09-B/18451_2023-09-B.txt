FREESTYLE stalked the contested early -ace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, set sail two wide in pursuit of KOALA entering the
final turn, overtook that rival midway through the turn and opened up a clear advantage entering the lane, and was never seriously threatened late.
DREAMB settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the inside entering the final
turn, shifted off the rail midway through the turn, and closed determinedly one out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. NO PEOPLE
unhurried early and trailed the field into the backstretch while racing out from the rail, launched her bid four wide entering the final turn, and improved her
position three out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. KOALA away alertly and vied for the lead from the inside of REA MEA entering the first turn,
set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside, shook clear of her pace rival approaching the final turn, was quickly overtaken by
FREESTYLE midway through the turn, and faded in the lane. REA MEA broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of KOALA entering the first
turn, chased that rival in the run down the backstretch, began to lose touch with her pace rival entering the final turn, and had little to offer late, while having
to steady slightly nearing the wire.

JOCK TALK stalked the leaders from the back of the pack while racing three wide entering the stretch the first time, continued with a three wide trip from a
stalking trip in the run down the backside, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and closed with a rush three out from the rail in deep stretch to get up in
time. THERE GOES MY HERO broke sharply and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, battled down the backstretch
from the outside of of DONE THAT, continued their battle through the final turn and into the stretch, but was unable to fend off the late surge by JOCK TALK
in the closing strides. DONE THAT away well and tracked the pacesetter from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to save ground
through the second turn, engaged the leader from along the inside midway down the backside, continued to battle with THERE GOES MY HERO through
the final turn and into the lane, and just missed the place while finishing two wide. KLIMTOGLORY away alertly and tracked the leader into the stretch the
first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the pace three wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked
the closing response needed when called upon. SILVER ARROW stalked the leaders while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time,
dropped back to trail entering the second turn, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response in the
drive.

BAKBURNER rushed up to assume command approaching the turn while racing one out from the rail, opened a clear advantage through the final turn, and
was never seriously threatened late. SHOCK THE HOUSE chased the leader into the turn while racing one out from the rail, and finished willingly two wide
in the drive while gaining ground late while laying in slightly in the closing strides. SAILINGFORTHESTARS away alertly and chased the leader into the turn
while saving ground at the rail, was never a threat to the winner but battled gamely from along the rail in the drive to garner a share in a solid debut.
DREAMING D'ORO away well, while drifting out in the opening strides, chased the pacesetter three wide through the turn, and battled gamely two out from
the rail in the drive while unable to gain ground late. The rider of DREAMING D'ORO lost his crop at the head of the lane. FOOTHILLS BLVD. broke sharply,
but was devoid of early speed while saving ground along the inside, and failed to make a late impact. KIKIS LOVE OF LIFE chased two wide into the turn
from the back of the pack, and failed to make a late impact while racing one out from the rail in the drive.

BECKETT'S BEST away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside, maintained
his advantage into the lane, and increased that margin late under confident handling. SHE'S KIND OF HOT broke sharply and stalked the leader from along
the rail entering the backstretch, continued to save ground while mounting her bid at the rail through the final turn, and closed determinedly from just off the
rail in the drive to prove second best. OUR BLOKE was off a step slow, and settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished smartly three wide in the drive to get up for a share. RICK'S DANCER away well and
tracked the pacesetter two wide into the backstretch, commenced his bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, but was outfinished late while racing at
the rail. ON MY GOOD SIDE broke inwards in the opening strides and trailed the field into the backstretch, saved ground through the final turn, but was
never a factor. MR MORRIS was off a step slow, but pulled his way into a stalking trip two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide
entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

Footnotes
JERSEY LILLIE broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two out from the rail through the
final turn, split rivals in mid stretch and inched clear late. PINEAPPLE TIDBITS stalked the early pace while racing two wide in the run down the backstretch,
rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to get up for the place. ROSE OF TEXAS away alertly and vied
for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and through the final turn, continued to battle for the
lead into the lane, and gave way grudgingly late while finishing on even terms with HARLAN'S ANGEL for a share. HARLAN'S ANGEL tracked the dueling
leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, launched her bid four wide entering the final turn, and closed five wide in the drive to finish on
even terms with ROSE OF TEXAS. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY rushed up to duel for the lead from the outside of ROSE OF TEXAS entering he first turn,
battled in the run down the backside and through the final turn while continuing to force the issue, but was outfinished late while racing one out from the rail
in the drive. RACINO stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced her bid from along the inside entering the final turn
while awaiting room, but needed more in the late stages. CERTIFIABLE unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, was always well back
and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
BOLD ARCH away well and raced to an uncontested lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace through the second turn
and in the run down the backstretch, maintained a clear lead through the final turn, but was all out to fend off JUST JIMMY late to prevail. JUST JIMMY
away alertly and eased off the lead to assume a tracking trip entering the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backside and into
the final turn, drifted in slightly while the rider appeared to have difficulties pulling his stick into his right hand, then surged late under right handed
encouragement to just miss. STORMY BLUE broke sharply and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, held his
position in the run down the backside, rallied from along the rail through the final turn, and finished willingly from along the inside in the drive in an even
effort. BOITANO settled off the early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the lane the first time, pulled his way closer in the run down the
backstretch, rallied from along the inside through the final turn, and closed one out from the rail in the drive. PAY MY WAY unhurried early while dropping
back to trail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. SET TO SHINE stalked the dueling
leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, held his position in the run down the backstretch, began to struggle while racing
three wide entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

AMANDA tracked the pacesetter into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, dropped into a stalking trip in the run down the backstretch
while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside through the final turn, tipped three wide for the drive and closed determinedly to be up in
time. ANIMA stalked the pacesetter into the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, rushed up to force the issue two wide entering the second
turn, continued to force the issue from the outside of BAKFIRE BABY in the run down the backside and through the final turn, disposed of her pace rival in
mid stretch, but was unable to hold off the late charge by AMANDA in the closing strides. MISS THE HYPE settled off the early pace while racing three wide
through the stretch the first time, began to advance midway down the backside to gain a striking position, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final
turn, shifted four wide in mid stretch and closed with a rush to just miss the place. BAKZONE tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while
saving ground at the rail, dropped back to trail in the run down the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and improved her position
while finishing three wide in the drive. BAKFIRE BABY away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, battled for the
lead from the inside of ANIMA in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with her pace rival entering the lane,
and weakened late. FILLY FATALE broke sharply and stalked the pacesetter through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, tracked the
dueling leaders in the run down the backside and into the final turn, but faded in the late going. TEXAS HUMOR trailed the field into the stretch the first time
while racing two out from the rail, bided her time towards the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but
was outfinished over the final furlong.
