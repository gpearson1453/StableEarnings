Footnotes
IMPACTO was quickest to the turn, showed the way through the backstretch, remained unchallenged into the stretch, and held under handling. SLEW'S
BAK raced three wide into the backstretch, gained closer order nearing the final turn, closed steadily into the stretch, and got up in time for second. STONE
CARVER stalked the pacesetter, lodged an all-out bid nearing the eighth pole but was unable to reach the eventual winner and was run down late. I'M
DASHING trailed and bid belatedly. QUINTO SOL saved ground and lacked a closing response.

CARSON'S LEGACY shifted outside entering the backstretch, chased four wide into the far turn, gained closer order, rallied determinedly under steady
urging, and won the bob. MR. KALYPSO contended the early pace from the rail, battled into the stretch, dug in late but lost the bob. MOONSHINE NOW
went after the dueling early pacesetters, gained a slim advantage in the final turn, and gave way grudgingly deep stretch. SIMMS broke in sharply then was
gapped early, and improved late. SMASH FACTOR pressed the early pace, was unable to keep pace with the field, and tired. VISION QUEST was outrun.

WHERE'S THE GOLD tracked the early pacesetters, shifted out to the four path into the backstretch, moved up alongside THE BEAT to challenge the front,
gained a narrow advantage into the stretch, and narrowly prevailed after a long hard drive. THE BEAT contended the early pace outside of LONESOME
CAT, gained a short advantage in the backstretch, responded gamely to a challenge from WHERE'S THE GOLD, battled inside through the stretch and lost
the nod. ESTIFRAAD sat in range while three wide, dropped back entering the backstretch, hustled outside into the final turn, and improved late.
RUNNINFORCOVER trailed the field early, gained closer order into the final turn, and showed interest late. LONESOME CAT vied inside early, was unable
to move on with rival leaving the backstretch, and faded gradually inside. ESCROW STYLE sat mid-pack while three wide, chased outside leaving the
backstretch, and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
GOLDIE SOCKS broke outward into ALBERTA then was outsprinted to the opening turn, pressed the pace from the rail, gained the lead at the top of the
lane, and held safely. ALBERTA bumped leaving then trailed the field early, advanced quickly in the far turn, angled out to the two path, and closed
determinedly but needed more ground. HERE'S LEXIE vied three-wide into the opening turn, set a pressured pace outside of GOLDIE SOCKS, was unable
to continue on with the eventual winner into the final furlong, and yielded in the stretch. SHES A COOL CAT went three wide in the first turn, advanced
outside in the far turn then raced wide into the lane, and improved position late. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL lacked the early speed needed from between foes,
and was dropped back gradually. DARKCLOUDOFSMOKE brushed away from the gate, and lacked a bid. MILITARY SASS bumped leaving the gate,
chased three wide through the backstretch, and wilted with a furlong remaining. ANTIGUA BAY raced three wide into the opening turn, and bore out sharply
leaving the final turn. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of ALBERTA against the rider of GOLDIE SOCKS alleging interference
leaving the gate was not allowed.

PRANCE sat in striking position behind the early pacesetters, moved up closer while five wide, swept the lead, and opened up through the stretch under a
brisk hand ride to score easily. BEAUTIFUL BABE vied between entering the opening turn, took pressure through the backstretch was overtaken in the final
turn, and finished evenly under steady handling. SWIFT SWALLOW raced three wide through the opening turn, drove four wide at the head of the lane, and
inched clear to secure a third-place finish. SASSY CINDERELLA fanned four-wide leaving the first turn, dropped back through the backstretch, chased in
the final turn, and lacked the rally needed in the drive. MISTY MATT brushed gate leaving then was gapped and closed well late. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY sat
just off the pace while three to four wide, and had nothing left in reserve late. SAVYSKYE vied inside early, was unable to keep pace with the field, and
faded. CUVEE TEE flashed inside speed and tired early.

Footnotes
REBATE sat in striking position from the two path, took over into the final turn, and drew clear under a strong hand ride. SHAKINOFFTHERUST saved
ground along the rail under a snug hold, shifted out to the three path and lacked the kick needed in the drive. I SAID QUIET sandwiched out, chased five
wide leaving the backstretch, lacked running room in the far turn, shifted out, and closed gamely for show. STUBBORN LOVE rated well off the pace while
four wide, rallied belatedly through the stretch, and was out-finished for third. ANNA'S IMAGE assumed the lead, showed the way through the backstretch,
was overtaken in the final turn, and gave way. KEEPMEINPOWER broke outward then was bumped hard leaving the gate, and lacked a serious bid.
DARLA'S FURY broke in, into inside rivals, raced three wide into the opening turn, settled five-wide through the backstretch, and tired early. ARANY broke
awkwardly and trailed throughout. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving KEEPMEINPOWER, I
SAID QUIET and DARLA'S FURY but made no change.
