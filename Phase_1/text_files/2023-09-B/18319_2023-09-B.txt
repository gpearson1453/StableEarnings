quarter-pole, came through to make a bid inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch, took the advantage under a drive outside the sixteenth-pole then drew
clear under steady urging. BABY SOX broke out at the start, raced just off the pace between foes, was asked in the four path while outside on the turn,
gained to make a bid outside the quarter-pole, took a short lead in upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop coming to the furlong marker, switched
to a right-handed crop while losing the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while able to secure the place. SERENADE SOLDIER was
hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in close to the two path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage
under a drive in upper stretch, fought into the final furlong and weakened while well clear for the show. PHINNEYS HARBOR broke in and bumped hard with
a rival, tracked the pace down the backstretch, was asked in the three path on the turn, chased into the stretch and tired. GOODBYE KYLE veered out at
the start then was corrected by the rider, chased the pace on the outside under heavy left-rein pressure, dropped back quickly while lugging out badly late
on the backstretch, went seven wide under a vigorous left-handed grip early on the turn, was guided back to the five path then moved to the four path
nearing the quarter-pole and had nothing left.

MUCHO MAMA MIA chased two to three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, took to the inside near
the three-sixteenths when UNHOLY backed away, rallied inside to take command inside the eighth pole, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. SHOTGUN
PATSY coaxed from the gate, dueled three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, dug in
and was collared just inside the eighth pole, ran on to preserve the place honors. MONTAUK MYSTIQUE stumbled at the start, chased five then four wide
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five then four wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. CAUSE I'M ELEGANT chased
four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. STRANGE
FRUIT broke out a step at the start and was bumped by MAXING THE BANK, who was recovering from a stumble, chased two to three wide coming under
coaxing near the five-sixteenths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact, then was reported to have bled. UNHOLY coaxed from the
gate, dueled along the inside of SHOTGUM PATSY, came under coaxing near the three-eighths and was headed for command at that station, took the
inside route into upper stretch and weakened. MAXING THE BANK stumbled badly at the start bumping STRANGE FRUIT when taking a left turn sharply
when recovering and lost the rider in the process, then got apprehended by outrider and walked off under her own power.

around the turn in the two path, was asked after turning into the stretch, came under a right-handed crop while starting to drift out at the eighth-pole,
continued to drift out some while tiring in the final furlong and held under steady urging. TENEBRIS was bumped on both sides at the start, settled under
some urging, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail while in pursuit of the winner in the stretch, gained in the final furlong and finished willingly for the
place. CLUBHOUSE bumped hard with rivals on both sides at the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the three path, gained on the
winner in the final furlong and earned the show. BUILT TO LAST bumped hard with rivals on both sides at the start, settled off the pace, dropped back
nearing the half-mile pole then angled out despite room in front, went five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
BARON'S LEGACY bumped hard with rivals on both sides at the start then was taken up, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged along at the rear, went
around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. TIVY veered in at the start and bumped hard with a foe which caused a chain bumping reaction of
several rivals, settled on the outside, was urged along in the four path on the turn and came up empty.

clear outside after tipping to the three path a furlong out, tipped out to the four then five path near the sixteenth marker in the clear for the first time in the
stretch and was tepidly urged by the rider through to the finish. KLICKITAT tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,

AWESOME CZECH was hustled from the gate then taken in hand early, saved ground while rated off the pace, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to
get the lead inside the furlong marker and proved best under good handling. BOXED WINE settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, turned into the
stretch in the two path, chased under a drive into the final furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage for the place. RUN
FOR YOUR HONEY went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, went two then three wide on the far turn, was roused while moving a bit
further out outside the quarter-pole, came seven wide into upper stretch, remained on her inside lead while chasing to the eighth-pole then swapped to the
proper lead and finished willingly for the show. ALITTLEBITNAUGHTY moved in before the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled towards the rear
on the outside, went two then three wide on the far turn, was roused near the quarter-pole then swung eight wide into upper stretch and improved position to
garner the last spot in the superfecta. BOSSY JEANS went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was given her cue in the three path on the far
turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong then was collared by the winner and weakened. ONCE AN EAGLE went around
the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was asked while two then three wide on the far turn, came five wide into upper stretch and lacked the
needed response. SHE IS ALL BUSINES was off a step slow, moved in at the rear, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the back, went two then three
wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch then moved further out and failed to impact. FREE FOR ME went around the first turn in the two
path, settled towards the rear, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came five wide into upper stretch, moved in near the three-sixteenths and failed to
threaten. BERTRILLE angled in towards the rear, settled on the inside, was asked on the far turn and failed to rally. DENVER'S ALLEY went to the front,
showed the way on the inside, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. CONEY tracked the pace on the
outside in the two path, engaged the leader on the far turn, battled under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened then
was vanned off after the race. BORNFORGREATNESS was taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the three path, was reserved on the outside
without cover, came under urging while three then four wide on the far turn, was driven six wide into upper stretch and failed to respond.

THOUGHT EXPERIMENT four to five paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying into contention a furlong out, dueled through to the finish with RISK FREE to
her outside, had that foe come inwards and was brushed and nudged just inside the sixteenth marker, then got the bob on the wire to prevail in game
fashion. RISK FREE chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
furlong from home, dug in under a drive dueling to the finish, came in slightly just inside the sixteenth marker brushing and nudging the aforementioned foe,
fought on gamely but ultimately lost the nod on the wire. PARTY AT GRANTS got bumped at the start by TAKE TIME TO DREAM and in turn bumped
ONLOOKER and was briefly taken in hand conceding four lengths to the front, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors in the final jumps. TAKE TIME TO DREAM broke out at the start bumping
PARTY AT GRANTS into ONLOOKER, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the
inside route into upper stretch and ran on to the finish. LA GIRVINA bobbled at the break, chased three then two wide, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths and went three wide into upper stretch, had the top pair go on by just inside the eighth pole and was tepidly handled and not being extended
before being steadied just inside the sixteenth marker as THOUGHT EXPERIMENT was nudged in front by RISK FREE despite the option of being able to
alter inside with two open paths, got out-finished in the late stages by a pair of rivals while effectively eased up. ONLOOKER got bumped at the start by
PARTY AT GRANTS due to pressure from TAKE TIME TO DREAM and conceded three lengths to the front, chased three to four wide bounding along
green early on, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went five to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. PUT THE CRAZY AWAY bobbled at
the break, led early on briefly before chasing four then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and
weakened. FEATHERING stumbled at the start, showed the way in hand along the inside, widened away into the turn and spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, yielded the front and tired through to the finish. There was a Claim of foul by the rider of LA GIRVINA alleging interference against both RISK FREE
and THOUGHT EXPERIMENT in the stretch. After review the claim of foul was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand before the race was declared
official.

Footnotes
NY TRAFFIC pressed the pace down the backstretch, dropped back near the half-mile pole, chased three then four wide on the turn, gained to make a bid
outside the leading duo into upper stretch, took the lead just inside the furlong marker and edged clear under strong urging. KINETIC SKY was hustled from
the gate then coaxed along off the pace, came under stronger encouragement while four then five wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive,
raced between foes in the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. SHERIFF BIANCO broke open his stall door prior to the start but remained in the
gate, settled off the pace, was shuffled back behind the winner when that foe dropped back leaving the backstretch, was roused while moving from three to
six wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and also finished willingly but just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show.
ROTKNEE bobbled at the start, was taken up between foes coming to the three-quarter pole then altered to the outside, advanced on the far outside to take
the lead outside the half-mile pole, vied in the three path on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and
weakened then just missed the trifecta. HE'SMYHONEYBADGER was hustled to the front then showed the way, lost the lead outside the half-mile pole,
vied along the rail while inside of two foes early on the turn, dropped back while steadying some coming to the three-eighths pole, kept on while moving out
some in the stretch and missed the superfecta. PROVOCATEUR pressed the pace, drew even for the lead at the nine-sixteenths, vied between horses in
the two path early on the turn then inside of a rival later on that bend, fought under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and
tired. WILLY BOI was last to commence, established a good position just off the pace, dropped back while moving from the rail to the three path on the turn
and lacked the needed response. SYNTHESIS dropped well behind, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and
was no factor.

Footnotes
SACRED WISH tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied in tandem
with SILVER SKILLET and overthrew the leader a sixteenth out, then inched away from that rival in the late stages with good energy. SILVER SKILLET
tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch, rallied in concert with the
aforementioned foe, ran on willingly to secure the place honors. SOVIET EXCESS three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
six wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. LIGURIA chased along the inside from near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up late foot. LADY BETH established the front and showed the way in hand
along the inside patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared a sixteenth from home, weakened
in the very late stages. TAX IMPLICATIONS (GB) got bumped at the start by JUNIPERMARSHMALLOW, tracked just off the inside from mid pack, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. JUNIPERMARSHMALLOW broke in at the start bumping
the aforementioned foe, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no rally.
SWEETLOU'SGOTACES three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened.
BOLIVIE (IRE) settled unhurried just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide at the head of
the stretch and made no impact. GET YOUR KICKS forwardly placed just off the inside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cornered three wide
at the top of the stretch, tired.

Footnotes
BEING BETTY became very fractious in the gate, was hustled to the front, showed the way under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn,
lost the lead at the five-sixteenths, dueled inside of the runner-up in the stretch, regained the ascendancy in the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed.
STORMY DISCO broke out at the start, was forwardly placed on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, took a
short lead at the five-sixteenths, dueled outside of the winner in the stretch and missed while able to get the place. NEEDED was well placed just off the
pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, pursued the top two in the drive and finished willingly for the show. SUPERSTARSUSAN
broke near the back of the field, settled towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved position. PRETTY UP
was taken in hand at the start, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused in the two path into the stretch then moved to the three path,
came between horses into the final furlong and also improved position. GIOIA MIA broke out at the start, settled off the pace, was roused four wide on the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. SUN AND WIND broke very alertly, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in
the two path on the turn and tired. FOLLOW YOUR ARROW stalked the pace down the backstretch, was taken up early on the turn, went three wide on that
bend, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. MOTHER MARY dropped back off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, came four wide
into the stretch and failed to respond. MASTERY'S SECRET was very slow into stride and spotted the front several lengths, saved ground on the turn,
turned into the stretch in the two path then moved further out and trailed.
