SUPERHIGHWAY settled back inside on the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced four wide on the far turn, dug in for the lead in
later yards and inched clear under the wire. NO FOOLING DUDE took over nearing the thirteen sixteenths pole and moved to the inside to show the way,
came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, cleared Fort Fortitude midway on the far turn but was met, and relented in later yards. EISELE rated
close inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then dueled through the stretch for third. FORT FORTITUDE
stalked off the rail on the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch and challenged nearing the three eighths pole, but dropped back off the rail midway on
the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. CHARLIE POTATOES raced in the three path on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn three wide and showed little further. MOON OVER MONTANA rounded the opening turn off the rail, gave chase
leaving the half mile pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and flattened stride.

RIDICULOUS saved ground on the first turn, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved from that point, entered the far turn near
the rail, eased to the four path approaching the head of the lane, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and held on well. JAYJAYDEE raced in the four path the first
turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the five path, dug in from the head of the lane and dueled through
later yards for second. HAGLER saved ground on the first turn, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was
outfinished for second later yards. UNCAPTURED KING rounded the opening turn about the five path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole
and raced at the rail on the far turn, had range on the leaders leaving the turn but flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. RAISE A SPEIGHTS took over
nearing the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, rounded the far turn near the rail,
dug in leaving the turn but was met toward mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. MONTAUK DADDY rated close off the rail, gave chase toward the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path then flattened stride. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND was never a factor.

dug in for the lead mid-stretch, drew clear later yards and held on well. SHERIFF'S KID raced off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole and dueled close in the four path on the far turn, dueled for second later yards and was gaining on the winner. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE rated

Footnotes
CAJUN COUSIN gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail, eased out leaving the turn, dug in to get up and raced clear the final
yards. MYGIDGETMARIE chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, angled to the five path toward the head of the lane and dug in to
take second the final yards. SHUTUPN'KISSME contested the pace at even terms, raced in the three path on the turn and remained a factor to deep stretch
before flattening stride. MUSIC LASS pressured the pace at even terms while between horses, moved to the rail toward the head of the lane and weakened
inside the sixteenth pole. AIM'S JUBILEE chased outside, rounded the turn about the five path and finished well. CASTLE TOY pressured the pace at even
terms and raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail most of the turn, but checked off the heels of Music Lass toward the eighth pole and flattened
stride. CHURCH KEY gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn and showed little in the lane. GOT ANY came away awkwardly and never factored.

Footnotes
TALENTED CORINNA chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and inched clear under the wire. CURLIN'S DOVE
pressured the pace inside, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn then dueled through the stretch for second while outfinished for the
win. MIDNIGHT PASS set a pressured pace through the backstretch, contested the edge in the three path on the turn, was met entering the stretch then
outfinished in the duel through the stretch. GREAT DEVOTION pressured the pace through most of the backstretch but dropped back past the five
sixteenths pole, rounded the turn off the rail and ran evenly in the lane. EXCLUSIVE ROSE gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn and ran evenly
in the stretch. TAKE CHARGE LISA pressured the pace through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and weakened in the lane.
AMERICAS WOMAN was sluggish into stride, rounded the turn about the five path and left the turn outside. SPUNKY ZOEY gave chase to no avail.
