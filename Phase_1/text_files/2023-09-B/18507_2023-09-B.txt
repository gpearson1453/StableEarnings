Footnotes
BORN FLAWLESS set the pace in the two path, kicked away from chasers in upper stretch and held off an outer bidder through the closing stages. RUN
SMITTY RUN trailed in the three path, picked up stride in the four to five path turning for home, sustained a rally to gain place at the furlong grounds, took
aim while closing in on the clear leader in the final sixteenth but was kept at bay. VALE stalked along the inside, then only managed to chase the clearing
leader in upper stretch, vied for show with an outer rival in the final sixteenth and prevailed. BOLT ABOVE stalked outside of the leader and from the three
path, applied mild pressure around the turn, but failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch, got outkicked for place by an outer rival at the furlong
grounds, vied for show with an inner foe while giving way in the late stages and was bested for that position. HARLEEZY bobbled at the start, raced of of the
pace in the two path and failed to factor. LAZARUS broke a beat slow, tracked in the four path, but steadily faded in the three path while under urging
around the turn.

Footnotes
MARKSWOMAN tracked from the two path, tipped outside of the top pair in upper stretch, quickened to bid three wide and between horses passing the
three sixteenths pole, drove clear as an outer DAISY JONES gave chase in the final furlong and held sway. DAISY JONES laid off of the pace in the three
path, rallied four wide and between horses in upper stretch to attempt a bid along with an inner MARKSWOMAN at the three sixteenths pole, gained place
while pursuing that one in midstretch and only managed to chase her home. MRS. SPEAKER lacked speed in the two path, shifted to the four path in upper
stretch stayed on between horses and gained show from an inner rival in the final sixteenth. JUBILANT JOANIE prompted the pace two wide, sparred with
an inner rival around the turn, led briefly before being outkicked approaching midstretch and weakened at the furlong grounds. ISABEL DE CLARE lacked
speed in the four path, then moved up between horses in the five path. I'M BETH DUTTON bore wide early after breaking on top, showed the way for the
opening quarter, but strode greenly while being headed by a pair of inner rivals entering the turn, chased them from the four to five path around the turn,
drifted to the six path entering the lane and weakened. AREUHAVINGFUNYET trailed in the three path, cut the corner turning for home, but steadied while
lacking rail room behind a tiring rival at the furlong grounds and failed to factor. BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE prompted the pace along the inside, sparred with an
outer rival for the lead around the bend and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
COMMANDER CARL set the pace along the inside, met an outer challenge around the far turn, repelled that rival and kicked away in upper stretch, then
was driven home. BREADMAN stalked two wide, prompted into the far turn before bidding turning for home, but was turned away in upper stretch and
proved second best. IMPROBABLE STORY stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the top pair and to the four path entering the lane, but lacked a bid
and held show. YAK tracked in the two path, pursued from between horses down the backstretch, but was coaxed around the far turn, got floated to the five
path entering the lane and failed to threaten. JOB SECURITY raced at the rear along the inside early on and never got involved. KEEN ON YOU broke
outwardly, laid off of the pace in the four path, but was done around the far turn and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
ANNA'S WISH set the pace along the inside, shook clear from an outer pressing pair into the turn, showed the way in the two path before inching further
away entering the lane, and gradually widened while hanging on her left lead. READY FOR TROUBLE tracked behind the top pair while gradually shifting
inwardly approaching the turn, sustained progress inside of rivals to gain place passing the three furlong pole, chased the clearing leader entering the lane,
delayed a lead change until the furlong grounds and lasted for place from an outer on-charging rival at the wire. FASTA LAVISTA BABY pursued from
midpack along the inside, shifted out to the three to four path at the three furlong pole, fanned to the six path entering the lane, then stayed on in the late
stages to miss reaching place. SENSIBLE CHOICE tracked in the four path, lacked progress through the lane yet sustained a chase to bid for show at the
sixteenth pole, but was outkicked by an outer rival leaving that station. ISA LEI prompted three wide, chased the leader around the turn, hung on her left
lead through the lane and tired in the final furlong. CRY IF I WANT TO chased from midpack in the two path, shifted to the three path entering the lane and
ran on. HIGH SISU laid off of the pace in the two path, cut the corner entering the lane and failed to menace. MISSY BEE broke outwardly then failed to
factor from the three path. GRACE AND FREEDOM hopped and broke multiple lengths behind the field, trailed in the three to four path and got outrun.
SWEET GUITAR prompted the pace two wide and between horses but caved with over three furlongs to go. DESPERATE TIMES lacked speed along the
inside and was done early.

Footnotes
TIGER MOON settled off of the pace in the two path after breaking towards the rear, shifted out to the four path with over five furlongs to go, inched closer in
hand turning for home to bid entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch, was collared by an outer bidder in the closing stages, yet held firm. NEPAL UP
trailed in the two path, gained ground in the three to four path around the far turn, tipped out to the five path in upper stretch as TIGER MOON opened up,
then gradually cut into that leader's margin in the final furlong, sustained a bid coming to the wire but was denied. NORDIC LIGHT pursued from midpack in
the four path, then in the three path and between horses down the backstretch, switched out to the five path in upper stretch and stayed on willingly to gain
show passing the sixteenth pole. MOMENT set the pace along the inside, clung to a margin from an outer bidder turning for home, but swiftly proved no
match for a wider challenger entering the lane and weakened. GREY STREAK stalked two wide, but was outmoved by an outer rival approaching the five
sixteenths pole and gave way. ON A SPREE saved ground off of the pace, but was buried and shuffled back around the far turn to trail the field at the five
sixteenths pole, split foes two wide in upper stretch, sustained improvement entering the final furlong, but flattened out and was eased up through the final
sixteenth. RANDELLO stalked along the inside and gave way around the far turn. MINE OWN STAR tracked in the three path, offered a bid at the five
sixteenths pole, vied before getting outkicked by an outer rival entering the lane and readily caved between horses.

Footnotes
TWIRLING GOOD TIME pressed two wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole as an outer rival ranged up alongside, yet swiftly kicked away in upper stretch,
drew off under a drive and was put to wraps in the final sixteenth. BLUE SQUALL hopped slightly while off slow, lacked speed in the two path, moved
between horses turning for home, launched a rally by splitting foes entering the lane, tipped outwardly in midstretch and sustained progress to gain place at
the sixteenth pole. SILVER ROSE tracked three wide, ranged up to the top pair to attempt a bid at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with an
inner clearing rival in upper stretch, chased through midstretch and lost place to an outer foe at the sixteenth pole. YES TO CHAMPAGNE laid off of the
pace in the four path and between horses, shifted in towards the rail in upper stretch and stayed on between horses. HOW SOON IS NOW was off a step
slow before bumping with an inner rival at the start, lacked speed while hung five wide, fanned to the six path entering the lane and stayed on mildly while
subtly shifting in. RENFREW chased two wide and between horses, shifted to the four path in upper stretch and yielded among foes. WILLOWY pursued
from midpack in the three path and between horses, shifted to the five path entering the lane and lacked a bid while hanging on her left lead. BEAUTIFUL
MISCHIEF bumped an outer rival at the start, raced towards the rear in the four path, but faltered into the turn, trailed, then surpassed tired rivals. MIA
MARCELA bobbled slightly while breaking on top, set the pace along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner at the five sixteenths pole and
stopped. IDALOU broke slowly, lacked speed in the two path, fanned to the five path in upper stretch and made little impact. ANNA AFTER MIDNITE
prompted along the inside, steadied slightly at the nine sixteenths pole, chased along the inside into the turn and weakened turning for home. DAWN'S
CREED pursued from midpack along the inside and faded around the turn.

MONEY SUPPLY set the pace along the inside, met his stable-mate's outer challenge around the far turn, shook free in upper stretch and held sway. ST.
ELMO tracked along the inside, pursued his pair of rivals around the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch, ran on to gain place from a tiring rival at the
sixteenth pole and narrowed the clear leader's margin late. WATASHA pressed two wide, bid around the far turn, but was turned away in upper stretch and
gave way, then was found to have bled.

TILTED TOWERS sped clear early on, showed the way in the two path while well in hand around the turn, delayed a lead change until inside the final
furlong, drifted out while getting collared by an outer bidder in the closing stages and narrowly held. EXCESS MAGIC tracked in the three path, rallied
outside of the top pair to offer a bid in the final sixteenth, but missed. GOODASIWONSWAS stalked along the inside, lost place while chasing at the furlong
grounds, tipped out and took aim between the top pair approaching the wire, but lacked a bid while tentative to split those foes. OF THE MOMENT raced off
of the pace in the four path and failed to menace. XY SPEED chased in the two path, but weakened into the turn and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
KRICKLE bobbled a bit at the start, stalked two wide, was coaxed along in the three to four path around the turn, bid in upper stretch and held between
horses late. WHEN I LOOK AT YOU pursued from midpack two wide, fanned to the six path entering the lane, sustained a grinding charge to bid in the final
sixteenth but missed. SHEZTHEFACTOR stalked in the four path before applying pressure outside of the leader and in the three path around the turn, led
nearing the lane, fought on with an outer bidder in midstretch, but was bested and saved show. TEMPTING LADY raced close up along the inside, then
chased while aiming between horses and missed reaching show. CHEYENNE MOON took contact from rivals on both sides at the start, raced off of the
pace two wide and between horse, then ran on in the four path in the final furlong. STANDOUTSENSATION tracked along the inside, shifted off the rail in
upper stretch and chased evenly. DANCING PRINCESS was fractious in the starting gate, then reacted erratically after bumping an inner rival at the start,
lagged behind into the turn, bore to the ten path entering the lane and moved up. KENTUCKYTERMINATOR lacked speed three wide and gave way.
QUEEN LEXI broke a step slow and failed to factor along the inside. SARAH'S DREAM tracked in the three path and weakened between horses. RED SUN
DRESS broke a step slow and made little impact from the four to five path. HONORABLE MISCHIEF bumped with an outer rival at the start, set the pace in
the two path, but was headed nearing the lane and wilted.
