Footnotes
SHAKY PANTS broke out at the start, showed speed and led early then tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two to three path on the turn,
gained to take the advantage into upper stretch and drew clear under steady urging. NEW YORK STRONG settled on the outside, was roused three to four
wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. WAR STRIDE moved up to get the
lead then showed the way, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead into upper stretch and weakened then was caught for the place while well clear for the show.
TREBLE CLEF bumped with a rival at the start, angled out under urging early then was coaxed along off the pace, went three wide on the turn and was no
factor. PARTY WITH SMARTY moved in while settling off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. MOON FROLIC bumped with a rival at
the start, was urged along at the rear, raced inside to the two path on the turn, suffered an injury to his right-hind leg nearing the sixteenth-pole and was
pulled up then vanned off.

Footnotes
KERRY chased just off the inside just off the pace down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch, paused in behind
the leader GET THE CANDY until roused getting clearance just outside the eighth pole, rallied up the rail to take command inside that station, dug in gamely
to prevail at the end. MASTEROF THE TUNES two to three wide in pursuit, got set down angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on
willingly but missed at the end. IM JUST KIDDIN chased three then two wide, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running
on to the finish to secure the show honors. ITSAKEYPER chased along the inside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was behind rivals on
pause, tipped out three then four wide and was unable to go further with THEODORA GRACE to her outside and IM JUST KIDDIN directly in front, could do
nothing but await a seam, got one finally seventy yards from the finish and was placed to urging and improved position to secure the last major share.
THEODORA GRACE broke out at the start, chased four then briefly three wide before tipping back to the four path five-sixteenths from home, continued
four wide into upper stretch and was set down at that juncture, dug in under a drive keeping on but was outfinished in the late stages. GET THE CANDY
established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under challenge to the outside and was placed to coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a host of challengers and was headed for command inside the eighth
pole, then weakened in the late going. FONTANAFREDDA broke out at the start and was corrected, raced three wide in aim of the front before advancing to
press the leader from the outside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the
final furlong.

Footnotes
MESSIDOR (IRE) went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, shifted from the rail to the three path while moving closer on the far
turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed well to get the lead near the eighth-pole, dueled with the runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed
under strong urging. ADAAY IN ASIA (GB) had her head turned at the start and was off a step slow, saved ground on the opening bend, settled off the
pace, moved closer in the two path on the far turn, rallied in the four path into the stretch, made a bid inside of the winner around the three-sixteenths,
dueled inside that foe in the final furlong and was denied while able to get the place. FAVOR was taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the two path,
was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, chased behind the pacesetter in upper stretch, moved out at the furlong marker and safely
secured the show while unable to reach the top two. TRAFFIC SONG was hustled from the gate then taken in hand early, raced in the three path on the first
turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. OK HONEY angled in at
the rear, saved ground on the turns, moved out in upper stretch and was no factor. FAITH IN HUMANITY (FR) went to the front then was taken under a tight
hold, showed the way on the inside, was held together into the stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and faltered then was eased late.

RINGY DINGY three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung four then three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command
a furlong out, edged away under a drive to prevail. VALUE AREA stumbled at the start recovering inwards and bumping ALTHENA, raced three to four wide
in aim of the front, advanced to take command three furlongs from home, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was
collared a furlong out, ran on to chase the winner home preserving the place honors safely over a rival on the wire. CATHERINE WHEEL coaxed from the
start, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the
show honors. MARTINGALE chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. MATAGORA BAY showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, got headed for
the front at the three-eighths and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. MONTEGO BAY
coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home, tired. ALTHENA got bumped at the
start by VALUE AREA, who recovered outwards from a stumbled, chased three then two wide until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. WAKE UP LAUREN got coaxed along early when devoid of speed from the gate, chased
three wide coming under coaxing once more midway on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
B D SAINTS was hustled from the gate, dropped from the three path to the two path while going to the front early on the first turn, showed the way down the
backstretch, controlled the action in the two path on the far turn, extended the advantage when set down in upper stretch, drew off under a drive to the
sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. EZ ROLL went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside but with some cover, was urged
four wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. ERIC FROM MIAMI broke in at
the start, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, bumped with a rival late on that bend, was reserved near the back, saved ground behind horses early
on the far turn then was roused near the three-eighths, shifted three wide into the stretch then angled further out, came between horses into the final furlong
and got up for the show. VIN SANTO broke near the back of the field, went three to four wide on the first turn, settled outside without the benefit of the
cover, moved from three to five wide on the far turn, bumped with a rival outside the five-sixteenths, came seven wide into upper stretch, brushed with a foe
near the sixteenth-pole and just missed the show while able to get the last spot in the superfecta. DUNEDIN CAUSEWAY was last to commence, went two
to three wide on the first turn, bumped with a rival late on that bend, was reserved near the back, moved from the two path to the four path on the far turn,
bumped with an opponent outside the five-sixteenths, bumped with another foe while coming six wide into upper stretch, raced between horses into the final
furlong, brushed with an opponent around the sixteenth-pole and just missed the superfecta. BENZODINI dropped from the five path to the three path on the
first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and tired. FROZEN FOUR was taken in
hand early, saved ground while reserved under a snug hold, moved closer midway down the backstretch, shifted to the two path late on the far turn, was
roused three wide into the stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed response. CHARGING FAST traveled around the opening bend in the two
path, settled near the middle of the field, went two then three wide on the far turn, bumped with a rival while five wide into upper stretch, raced between
horses into the final furlong and failed to rally. DILLON was well placed in the second flight while hugging the rail, took an awkward stride late on the far turn,
chased inside in the stretch and came up empty. A KNIGHT'S COURAGE went four then three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, raced between
horses in the two path on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole and failed to respond.

Footnotes
QUALITY G got bumped and bounced around between foes after the start when CARLIN CLAN placed a trio in tight briefly tucking over from the outside
before tipping back out to relieve it, settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, made steady progress to be just off the pace when placed to coaxing
near the quarter pole before being set down angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, inched away under a drive to
prevail. EXTREME ACCESS tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive offering up a bid a furlong out, ran on to chase the winner home willingly for the place honors. MIRACLE MIKE saved ground at the tail of the
field, came under coaxing tipped just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, closed well to procure the show honors.
WILLINTORISKITALL coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
continued in the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. KINGFISH STEVENS showed the way in
hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong
out, then weakened in the late going. FRONT MAN chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, made no late headway. BRICCO saved ground near the rear of the field, came under encouragement with five-sixteenths to go, angled four wide
into upper stretch and offered no response. LORD GATLING chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into
upper stretch, weakened. MISTER ABARRIO just off the inside tracking from just off the pace, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, angled
four to five wide for home and weakened in the stretch. CARLIN CLAN tucked in briefly after the start placing MISTER ABARRIO, QUALITY G, and
WILLINTORISKITALL in tight to his inside forcing those rivals to jostle briefly for two paths before tipping back out to relieve the pressure, raced three wide
into the first turn, tracked the pace just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and
weakened.

FILM STAR coaxed from the gate to establish the front, showed the way rated on the pace in the two path patiently handled through sensible splits and
settled into a comfortable rhythm, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, the rider peering inside and then outside before being roused straightened
away, drew clear under a drive to prevail. CONSTITUTIONLAWYER four then three wide through the first turn, chased four wide coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. IRON WORKS three
then two wide through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch, kept on to
procure the show honors. WILD BANKER brushed the off side stall at the start, chased two to three wide until tipped four to five wide at the three-eighths
put to coaxing, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. SOUTHERN DISTRICT chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired.
