Footnotes
ROLLIN ALL THE WAY forwardly placed near the inside, shifted out three wide at the top of the stretch, responded under left handed urging to make the
lead past the furlong marker, shook clear and won under strong handling. LADY ABRIL checked along the inside just past the five eighths pole, saved
ground through the turn, shifted out to the six path entering the stretch and was steadily cutting into the winners' advantage late. APPEALING SENORITA
pressed the pace three wide into the turn, made the lead nearing the quarter pole, kept a narrow lead past the furlong marker then was outfinished. STAR
MABEE broke in front, set the pace along the inside into the turn, kept momentum until deep stretch then gave way. SHEZA FINE JUSTICE was taken
outside soon after the start, had good early speed four wide then faded. CARMEN OHIO was no factor. DOUBLE EDGED rushed to contention between
horses two wide, had speed through the turn then was used up.

Footnotes
CANDY CRUSHEM away alertly, opened a daylight lead on the first turn, was put to pressure before a half, turned back that rival on the far turn, was
challenged again by the runner up nearing the furlong marker, dug in gamely under right handed urging late and proved best. LAZARUS PROJECT had
good position, loomed boldly outside the winner two wide into the stretch and was denied. ITASCA allowed to settle, moved up three wide on the far turn
then leveled off. GEH SCHNELL trailed into the stretch then passed tiring rivals in the six path. ONLYATTHESHOE failed to menace. EXALTED JOY well
placed, failed to respond. KOSCIUSZKO checked along the rail when in right entering the first turn, went up to pressure the winner two wide before a half,
remained a sharp threat into the stretch then gave way.
