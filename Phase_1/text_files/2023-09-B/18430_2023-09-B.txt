PACO THE TACO MAN stalked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid in upper stretch and
kicked clear. CASTLECOVE SPIRIT raced off the pace on the outside early, continued around the bend in the three path and improved position in the
stretch while never threatening the winner. FREE DROP BACH led the way from the two path up the backstretch and around the turn, was caught in upper
stretch and weakened further in the final furlong. HAY HAY HARRY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground
around the turn and made no bid. WATCH THE TRAMCAR was away slowly, trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and
was no threat.

Footnotes
FRANKIE'S EMPIRE stumbled leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four
path coming around the turn, dueled in the lane, pulled clear near the wire and held that margin. MANTAKETHEBLESINGS raced in the middle of the pack
between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground late. FACTOR U AND ME IN led
the field on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to show the way while racing in the two path around the bend, dueled in the lane
and weakened late. BATI KING chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the three path and was outkicked in the lane.
MASAKADO raced off the pace on the outside early, navigated the turn from the five path and showed no kick. TUSCAN RULER tracked the pace setter on
the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded from there. SURFBOARD raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the bend and made no bid.

Footnotes
MR. ANTONELLI led the way between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and held that margin to the wire, in command
throughout. BEN'S HERO stalked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and improved position in the
lane. STOMPING MOON tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn and finished evenly. DIVINING
STONE trailed well behind the field through the early going, saved ground around the bend and made up some ground in the stretch while never
threatening. ALBOROTO settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and showed no
kick. KAMIKAZE FOX pressed the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and faded from there. CITY
HUMOR dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the three path and tired in the stretch.
