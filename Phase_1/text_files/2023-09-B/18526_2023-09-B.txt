Footnotes
SERENDIPITOUS set the early pace, was nicely rated on the front end, repulsed a bid around the far turn, drew off late under mild urging. MARVIN'S
EXPRESS pressed the winner throughout, could not gain late but held place. KARAMEL CORN was never far back, angled out in the stretch and had a mild
bid while no threat. NOTHINLASTSFOREVER had good position while three wide and lacked a late response. DAWN'S LIGHT allowed to settle, failed to
menace. ACCURATE had good position on the inside and faded in the stretch. SAMMY DA BULL was pulled up soon after the start and was vanned off.
The stewards posted the inquiry sign but took no action.
