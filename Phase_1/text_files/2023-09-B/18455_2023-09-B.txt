RAIN DIVA chased clear leader three wide on the backstretch, advanced to get on terms with rival midway through the turn, exchanged bumps on the turn,
overtook rival in upper stretch and edged away under a drive. SECRET OF WAR sent clear on the backstretch, lost clear advantage on the turn when RAIN
DIVA ranged up outside, bumped with said rival couple times in the second half of the turn, fully overtaken in upper stretch and kept on to save second in a
dead heat. ISLAND LIFE settled well off the pace on the backstretch, continued to trail on the turn, launched rally widest in the lane and made good ground
late to get up for second. NICE AND TRUE chased two wide on the backstretch, continued slightly off the rail on the turn, entered lane in range and finished
one paced inside. QUEEN VERRAZANO reared and came away slowly, wrapped up and eased.

EPIC DRAMA away well, went for lead with a pair of outside rivals, eased back and settled in a chasing position, continued along the rail on the turn, eased
out and took aim three wide heading into the lane, asked and delivered for a clear win. NEAH BAY vied for lead two wide on the backstretch, continued two
wide on the turn, took command in upper stretch, led passing the sixteenth pole and over taken by rallying rival late. VERMEER bumped when in between
rivals early on the backstretch, vied for lead along the rail, continued pressing the pace on the turn and kept on gamely while being outkicked in the lane. B
D R DRAGSTER had to steady early while exiting the chute, settled off the pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn
and made progress with a mild rally along the rail. WE MISS GENO near the lead early, bumped in between and had to take up nearing the three eighths
pole, lost rhythm and took awhile to gather, kept wide on the turn while rider stood up and saved to the wire. ROCKY JACK off slow, stalked pace three wide
on the backstretch, floated out five wide by rival on the turn and came up empty.
