MODERN MIDAS raced off the pace between foes, took over into the stretch and edged off while kept to his task. BOOK MARKER settled inside, advanced
on the turn then went evenly late. JEWELS IN THE BAY lacked speed inside, angled out on the turn with a mild rally in the stretch. FINANCIAL STRENGTH
trailed far behind, rallied very wide into the lane narrowing the gap. HOLY CITY hustled to the front, remained well clear for half a mile then proved empty in
the stretch. REX KWON DO stalked the loose pacesetter three wide then faded on the turn. BOYS AND BULLETS broke alertly and raced wide while close
up then stopped abruptly.

CITY RAGE set a measured pace in the two path, repelled a challenge midway on the final turn then drew off under moderate pressure. MT SURIBACHI
stalked the pacesetter three wide, bid on the final turn but proved no match for the winner. MR. EINSTEIN trailed early, moved closer wide before half a mile
then flattened out. TIZ A PRINCE dropped back after a quarter mile, faded on the final turn and passed a stopping rival. SOVEREIGN CHANGE prompted
the winner along the inside then began fading at the three eighths pole.

CAUSALISTIC saved ground early, moved very wide into the stretch with a mild bid. RELISHMENT moved closer between rivals into the far turn then
flattened out in the final furlong. HENRYTHETHIRD hustled to a narrow lead inside then stopped after half a mile. ABUELO NUNO moved close up three
wide then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
PALLINO took control at once with little urging then widened through the stretch and was taken in hand through the final stages. BALI AMOUR lacked
speed, advanced very wide and closed well for the place while no threat to the winner. DOS DE OROS saved ground off the pave, faded on the turn then
came again for the show. WRIGLEY RESERVE offered a brief bid on the turn and continued willingly in the lane. MYHEARTWILLGOON raced in closest
pursuit of the pacesetter and tired in the stretch. I AM DADA MOON dropped back near the inside in the opening quarter and was never a factor. AMORE
D'ORO chased very wide down the backstretch and lacked a rally. NUEDORF bobbled soon after the start, rushed up inside, steadied along in the opening
furlong and faded. WONTCATCHHIMTODAY broke poorly then trailed throughout losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
VEESON far back early, rallied strongly inside, took over in the final furlong and surged off late. MASK PATROL vied inside, shook loose into the stretch but
could not hold off the winner. BATTUTA D'ORO broke slowly, advanced outside then flattened out late. PROFESSOR KOOL raced off the leaders wide
throughout and continued well to the finish. BUMP N RUN broke through the gate prior to the start, raced close up and finished gamely.
ONLYGODCANJUDGEME broke very slowly, trailed far behind then picked off rivals late while no threat. BLUE ROYAL was bumped about and squeezed
back early then never a factor. NINJA PRIZE alternated for the advantage outside for half a mile and stopped. RUSH CENTER moved close up early
outside then drifted wide faltering.
