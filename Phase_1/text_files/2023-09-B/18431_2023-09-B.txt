Footnotes
REFUGIADA was prompted along while in range around the six path, loomed from the five path while under a ride rounding the turn, bid from the four path
at the top of the lane, took the lead while still on her left lead passing the eighth pole, and held on under a dive. BABY SASSICAIA stalked in the four path,
bid in the three path rounding the turn, took a short lead passing the quarter pole, kept on while tipping into the two path entering the stretch, lost the lead to
the outer winner passing the eighth pole, but held on to place in a photo. FLUFFY bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the three path, was roused
from the two path midway around the turn, angled out to the six path passing the eighth pole, and ran on for show. SMART JENNY bumped between foes at
the start, laid off the pace inside, received right handed cues while in the three path rounding the turn, but was one-paced in the four path down the lane.
SONADORA GIRL bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the four path, was under coaxing in the five path rounding the turn, but drifted out in the
stretch, and made no impact. DUKES GONNA TAPIT set the pace in the three path, was roused from the two path midturn, but yielded along the inside in
upper stretch. NAUGHTY FAVORS pressed from the five path into the turn, but began to fade between foes passing the quarter, and was no threat.
WONDERFULVENEZUELA chased in the two path but backed up rounding the turn.

Footnotes
CRYSTAL COAST settled off the early pace in the two path, made and inside move to take over midway down the backstretch, drew clear in the two path
around the far turn and widened while ridden out in the lane. LA RUSIA had her head turned at the start, trailed in the four path early, made a quick move
early on the backstretch, prompted the winner in the three path rounding the far turn, could not match strides with that foe in the stretch but lasted for the
place. DOMINEERING had early speed between foes, was rated back, raced off the pace in the two path around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch,
rallied outside and just missed second. FRENCH FRANC (FR) raced off the pace four and five wide and had a mild stretch gain. MONEY FACTOR was
outrun inside. MORNING COLORS threw her head at the start, rushed up inside, set the pace in the two path around the first turn, chased inside around the
far turn and faded through the stretch. ANOTHERDAYGONEBY played no factor while racing four and five wide. RUBYSA raced in range three and four
wide and had little left after a half.

Footnotes
CANTARO bumped at the start with an outer foe, tracked in the two path, steadied and bumped while between foes going into the turn, drifted out in the
stretch while rallying passing the eighth pole, and drew past the inner leader in the final sixteenth. ONE FAST DREAM got bumped by an inner foe at the
start, pressed in the three path, bid going into the turn, ran on while still in the three path to take the lead passing the eighth pole, but drifted out late and
was caught in the final sixteenth by an outer foe to place. UNCAPTURED BOY broke out and bumped an outer foe, set the pace in the two path, was
roused when challenged passing the three-eighths, lost the lead along the inside nearing the eighth pole, and faded to show. MOTOWN PUNK bumped with
an inner foe at the start, chased in the four path, bumped with an inner foe going into the turn, was under right handed encouragement while tipping out to
the five path into the lane, but was one paced. CORPORATE AFFAIR stalked inside, steadied going into the turn, swung out to the six path into the stretch,
but made no impact. BESTIAL bumped between foes at the start and always trailed around the two path. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF
MOTOWN PUNK AGAINST THER RIDER OF CANTARO FOR INTERFERENCE AROUND THE HALF MILE MARK WAS DISALLOWED AS THE
STEWARDS FAILED TO SUBSTANTIATE THAT CLAIM OF FOUL.

Footnotes
HERE COMES BULLET stalked the pace in the three path, was floated out turning for home, dueled outside of SARAWAT past the sixteenth pole and
edged ahead late. SARAWAT set the pace in the two path, drifted out turning for home, battled on inside of the winner and was second best late. KUHL
STAR chased the pace five wide and was along for the show. SIR KAHN hesitated at the start, saved ground off the pace, moved into a clear third in upper
stretch but flattened out and lost the show late. HE'S IN CHARGE raced in range four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. ALEX'S
STRIKE played no factor while racing two wide. ROYAL KITTEN had his head turned at the start, raced well back outside and was never involved. LEE
ANN'S WARRIOR failed to menace while racing three wide.

Footnotes
TOP LOOK set the pace in the three path, was coaxed from said position turning into the stretch, opened up passing the eighth pole, and was driven out.
ROMASHKA prompted the pace in the two path, was under right handed encouragement along the rail midway around the turn, and fought on inside of
rivals down the lane for place. ELISSA JOE tracked inside, was cued between foes midway around the turn, swung out to seven path into the stretch, and
kept on while on her left lead for show. BREAKING BULLET stalked in the three path, was coaxed from the five path turning into the lane, but faded
between foes in the final furlong to miss minor placings. DESERT DIVA was unhurried in the two path, roused from the three path midway around the turn,
but made no impact in the four path down the lane. HYDRIA was hustled along in range around the five path, driven between foes in the four path around
the turn, but weakened from the six path in the stretch. SAMURAI'SDON'TCRY rated in the six path, was under right handed encouragement in the five path
rounding the turn, but empty from out in the center at the top of the stretch. EMPIRE GIRL chased in the four path but backed up rounding the turn.

Footnotes
R HARPER ROSE bumped with TEARDUC at the start, sped to the front soon after, set the pace in the two path and drew off while ridden out. STAR OF
SATURN chased the pace three and four wide, was no match for the winner but kept on to be clearly second best. AVELLINO raced closest to the winner in
the three path and lacked a closing bid. FAY'S RHONDA CARES was off a step slowly, trailed early, advanced five wide around the turn and failed to
sustain that bid while sticking on the left lead in the lane. SHE HAS CLASS was outrun inside. TEARDUC was bumped at the start and had only brief speed
two wide.

Footnotes
BUBBLY CHAMPAGNE chased in the three path, tipped to the rail and was cued to bid thru an opening around the turn, led passing the quarter, kicked
away around the four path into the lane under a drive, and was wrapped up late. LUCY'S COOKIE set the pace from the two path into the turn, lost the lead
to the inner eventual winner while in the three path approaching the quarter, floated out to the six path into the stretch, stayed on her left lead thru the
stretch, and held place. LOVEYS EMBRACE stalked in the five path, was coaxed while floating out to the seven path in upper stretch, and kept on while
drifting in for show. ISAYSO threw her head as the gates opened, rated in the two path, was under coaxing along the inside midway around the turn, and
evened out around the two path down the lane. SPANISH GIRL had a slow start, raced off the pace in the three path, was driven around the turn, drifted out
to the seven path in upper stretch, and made no impact. GET READY GAL broke out at the start, pressed in the four path, but faded between foes turning
into the lane. DANNEEL was hustled along from wellback along the rail and never menaced. WINDRUSH broke slow and always trailed from the three to
five paths.

Footnotes
MAGICSHADOW stalked inside, waited for room in the two path passing the quarter, fanned out to the seven path entering the stretch, and rallied past an
inner trio in the final furlong. SUMMER STORM STRIC trailed in the three path, floated out under a drive around the far turn and was in the eight path at the
top of the lane, ran on into the final furlong, and got up for place late. CHEER COACH hopped at the start, tracked between foes in the three path, was
driven in the four path around the far turn, bid while swinging out to the six path into the stretch, kept on to take the lead passing the eighth pole, but was
caught by an outer pair in the closing stages to show. ATOMICO had an awkward start, rated in the two path, swung out to the six path under a ride turning
into the lane, altered inwards to the four path nearing the final sixteenth, and evened out. FIRST COAST STORM set the pace in the two path, lost the lead
along the rail early around the far turn, dug in from inside turning into the stretch, but yielded passing the eighth pole. DIAMOND MESSA was rank in the
five path rounding the first turn, pressed the pace under a hold in the four path down the backstretch, took a short lead under a nudge early around the far
turn, was cued from the three path into the lane, but gaveway between passing the eighth pole. EXCLUSIVE DANCER chased in the five path, was under
right handed encouragement in the two path rounding the far turn, but did not threaten.
