Footnotes
UNCLE O. G. was rated on the front end from inside, asked leaving the bend, moved clear and kept MY KINDA TETON at bay under steady handling. MY
KINDA TETON vied for the lead outside UNCLE O. G. from the early going, was all out in the lane but lacked the needed late kick. MARY'S BOY without
early speed, had the rail on the bend, gradually angled out for a clear path inside the final furlong, took over third approaching the last sixteenth and slowly
closed the gap on the top pair. I'M YOUR VALENTINE chased in midpack from just off the inside and rallied belatedly between rivals deep stretch.
THACKER FROMM prompted the early speed from just outside then flattened out for the drive. LAGRUE raced in contention between rivals on the
backstretch, had the rail on the bend, fanned out nearing the end of a half mile and also flattened out through the lane. BLUE TEARDROPS failed to
menace in a ground-saving trip. LORD SHAFTESBURY stayed well off the inside most of the way and showed little.

Footnotes
RED MOSCATO soon shared the lead in close quarters from along the rail, was allowed to move ahead on the bend then gradually opened up in the lane
under urging. STANCE was hustled along to contest the pace outside RED MOSCATO, was no match for that one when set down for the drive but went
unchallenged for second. TIGGER ATTACK unruly and reluctant to load, chased from just off the inside then rallied belatedly five wide in the stretch.
PETE'S LEGACY was prominent from outside for a half mile, four wide into the lane and began to wear down. STROPE dwelt significantly at the break,
advanced from inside on the bend, angled out six wide upper stretch and improved position without threatening. C C RITHMS bumped at the break, was a
factor from inside on the backstretch but yielded on the turn and had no late bid. KISSES FOR WEEJ broke inward, bumping C C RITHMS, stayed well off
the inside taking the bend and was empty for the drive. DRINKING TOUR chased from outside, was just off the rail on the turn and had little to offer for the
stretch run. MAD WISH was prominent just outside STANCE for a half mile then quit.

Footnotes
BLURT soon had the inside, shared the lead in hand, moved clear when asked nearing the second bend, drew off under urging in the lane, began to wear
down some deep stretch but maintained full control under steady handling. TWO COOKIE RULE was bumped and forced inward at the break, settled just
off the inside, advanced on the second turn, fanned outside AWESOME WILLY for the stretch run and drew clear for second late. AWESOME WILLY was
bumped solidly and forced into TWO COOKIE RULE at the start, quickly recovered to be prominent from outside, moved clear for second and angled in on
the second bend, proved no match for BLURT when set down for the drive and gradually wore down inside the last eighth. STORM BORN bore in at the
break starting a chain reaction of bumping, soon trailed, stayed well off the inside and was never a factor. BLAZEN ROAD hesitated at the start then altered
in to avoid TWO COOKIE RULE, moved up quickly to split rivals two wide midway on the backstretch to vie for the lead, did not stay with BLURT nearing
the second turn and steadily faded from inside. BOURBON DELIGHT displayed early speed outside BLURT then gave way three wide soon after travelling
a half mile.

TRY TRY AGAIN forwardly placed just inside MY LITTLE TIPSY on the backstretch, was boxed in and brushed several times with COMFORT ME NOW
taking the bend, altered inside MY LITTLE TIPSY upper stretch, took the lead with a sixteenth left, was clear seventy yards out and kept COMFORT ME
NOW at bay. COMFORT ME NOW prominent between rivals, was brushed and crowded several times by TRY TRY AGAIN through the turn, came into the
lane outside MY LITTLE TIPSY, rallied belatedly and began to drift out under left-handed pressure in the waning yards. MY LITTLE TIPSY set a pressured
pace off the rail, angled in into the bend, moved clear, floated out some entering the stretch and gradually wore down between rivals nearing the final
sixteenth. NOT AGAIN JACKIE bumped with LITTLE MIGHTY MAN leaving the chute, chased from outside, came five wide into the lane and showed a
willingness to run late. CARL G hesitated at the break, came into contention along the rail on the turn, fanned out to path four for the drive and began to
flatten out. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN squeezed between horses briefly leaving the chute, was an early factor toward the outside but faded just off the inside on
the bend. PAYSTER pressed the pace from outside on the backstretch but began to fade between horses on the turn.

Footnotes
CHARLIE'S BEACH without early speed from outside, closed the gap three wide on the bend, continued his bid four wide in the lane, drifted out slowly
under left-handed pressure as he gained the lead inside the last eighth and shook off SECRET HONOR as he kept a straight path the final sixteenth.
SECRET HONOR chased from inside, angled out widest to advance on the turn, rallied outside CHARLIE'S BEACH in the stretch, loomed a serious threat
as he gradually altered out to avoid the latter inside the final furlong, leveled off the last sixteenth but was easily second best. UH OH IT'S MAGIC bumped
with PLAY THE BLUES at the break, saved ground taking the bend, passed inside some tired ones in the lane and drew away for third in the late going.
MAXIMUS DECIMUS raced in the second flight from outside but gave way from path three in the stretch. ULTIMATE FIGHTER broke on top and was soon
clear of the rest, saved ground on the turn, floated out some into the stretch and gave way between rivals the last furlong. LONE RETURN broke a step slow
and inward, was steadied behind traffic, chased from between horses, was just off the inside on the bend, angled to the outside upper stretch but had no
late bid. HALF THE BATTLE soon trailed, stayed off the inside through the turn, steadily angled out as LONE RETURN came out upper stretch, altered in
with a furlong to go and had little to offer the rest of the way. PLAY THE BLUES bumped with UH OH IT'S MAGIC at the start, soon was boxed in behind the
leader, had the rail on the bend, quickly gave way just off the inside into the lane, drifted out upper stretch and continued to fade.

Footnotes
CAMPISI was hustled to gain the lead after the first sixteenth, drew away from the rest, was just off the rail through the bend, began to wear down deep
stretch but held sway under steady urging. ETERNALLY GRATEFUL chased from outside, lost ground four then five wide taking the turn, rallied in the lane,
gradually altered out to stay clear of LORD DYLAN inside the last furlong and moved clear as he closed in on CAMPISI in the waning yards. LORD DYLAN
broke alertly but was soon overtaken from inside, moved clear for second three wide on the bend, gradually drifted out inside the final eighth, held a straight
path in the late going but did not have enough left. PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN moved to the inside midway on the backstretch, angled out some upper stretch,
continued to gradually drift out then altered inside LORD DYLAN deep stretch. GALLANT BUCK chased from just off the inside, swung out to path four into
the lane and slowly lugged in under right-handed pressure. BLAME TERI chased from between horses, was in path three on the turn, moved to the rail
entering the stretch and had little to offer.

WILDWOOD BYE settled outside, picked up her pace and moved to the inside entering the bend, rallied in the lane, took the lead inside the final sixteenth
and drew clear. LILY'S WOOFY was sent to set a pressured pace inside rivals, moved clear on the turn, floated out some entering the lane, gradually drifted
out upper stretch, was straightened inside the last furlong but did not have enough left the final sixteenth. TRIPLE SCOUT fractious in the gate, moved to
the outside midway on the backstretch once the race began, took over second three wide on the bend, fanned out further for the drive and lacked the extra
needed deep stretch. ICY RIVER was also fractious in the gate, received an equipment adjustment, was taken out and reloaded, displayed brief speed
outside LILY'S WOOFY then began to fade before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
PROTONIC POWER jostled with CHEEKERS at the start, was settled, gradually progressed just off the inside, came into contention three wide on the
second bend, took the lead upper stretch and shook free of SNOOZER in the waning yards. SNOOZER broke on top, moved clear and took the inside on
the backstretch, lengthened command on the second turn, began to wear down in the lane, drifted out midstretch, was corrected then lugged in late. LAND
MARK DEAL was bumped twice by KARAYEL at the start then forced into DIAMOND DAVE, settled inside, angled out through the second bend, came into
contention four wide in the stretch, could only make up minor ground on the top pair the final furlong but was easily best of the others. SEMINOLE BEACH
also jostled with CHEEKERS at the break, was prominent outside SNOOZER for nearly five furlongs then began to fade. KARAYEL broke inward, bumping
twice with LAND MARK DEAL, was four wide taking the fist bend, three to five wide through the second turn and failed to have a significant stretch
response. SILVER QUARTERS failed to menace racing widest throughout. DIAMOND DAVE was bumped shortly after the start, chased three or four wide
and also had no significant stretch bid. CHEEKERS unruly in the gate, quickly overcame being jostled between rivals at the break to vie for the lead from
inside, did not stay with SNOOZER on the backstretch and gave way before finishing five furlongs.
