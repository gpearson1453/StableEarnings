Footnotes
WOMAN'S DREAM chased the early pace two wide, took command near mid turn then widened at will the balance of the trip to win as much the best while
in hand. OH GLORIOUS DAY stalked the early pace four wide, had a mild late rally and finished clear for second. FLAME FOR REAL raced outside and
came on late for a minor share. SALTMAKESHERSWEET set the early pace along the inside, had speed into the stretch then weakened. MISS
SPRINGSTEEN stalked the early pace three wide and weakened on the turn. CURLIN PEARLS was no factor. KISS ME QUICK bore out badly bumping
hard with LUCKY STUFF at the start and brief speed. LUCKY STUFF was bumped hard then squeezed between rivals at the start and failed to reach
contention. HONEY BEE GOOD stumbled inward bumping LUCKY STUFF at the start and was no threat.

SEEKING FREEDOM stumbled at the start, trailed into the stretch then passed tiring rivals. RIVERS OF DENIRO was no factor. JUSTA LITTLE MOORE
also in tight at the start was no threat. STRIKING LAD had brief speed. AKIMBO was in tight at the start, settled mid pack and weakened in the stretch.
TAHLEQUAH JOE chased the winner into the turn and stopped in the stretch.
