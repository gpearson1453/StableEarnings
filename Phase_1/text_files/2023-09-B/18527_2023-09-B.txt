Footnotes
ERASMO'S GIRL was bumped on the break, settled near the rear in the beginning, nudged to get involved more entering the backstretch, came under a
ride three furlongs from the wire, was urged left handed with five sixteenths to go to rally three wide with a quarter mile to run, swung outside widest in the
five path looking the main threat turning for home and pulled away easily in the final sixteenth. PHIL IN ECHO stumbled, breaking outwards at the start,
travelled on the rail in midfield through the first turn, took closer order inside to be part of the tracking trio at the half, waited on the fence through the far turn,
slipped up the rail at the quarter pole but was no match for the winner but bested the rest comfortably in the end. TEXT ME UP was brushed inside being
pushed out slightly on the break, kept a close eye while three deep outside foes watching the loose speed horse down the back straight, closed in to bid
three wide three eighths from the finish, had a chance in the three path battling up front straightening out for the drive, could not find another gear late and
faded while holding for third at the finish. A GAL FOR T J tracked the frontrunner two wide on the first turn, was content sitting back off the loose pacesetter
down the backstretch, bid between horses in the two path three furlongs from home, could not quicken with runners midway on the far turn, lost action inside
the quarter pole and faded in upper stretch. FORESTERS PRINCESS was eager early clearing to the lead on the rail setting a brisk pace into the first turn,
continued up front unchallenged down the backside posting strong fractions at the half, was headed by foes with three eighths to run, roused maintaining
position, mildly spurted away at the quarter pole, was collared on each side in upper stretch and yielded. ABSOLUTE JEWEL was unhurried trailing the field
in the early stages, began to gather momentum lengthening stride at the three furlong marker inside, closed in quickly on the tiring leaders between rivals at
the quarter pole, clipped heels, fell and walked off. STEWARDS GENERAL INQUIRY AT THE QUARTER POLE RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
WEEHAWKEN prompted the pace down the backside, hounded the front runner on the turn, pounced for the lead three wide at the top of the stretch and
was kept to the task late to hold safe at the finish. GOOGLY EYES was checked mildly soon after the break, co-trailed on the outside in the third flight
throughout the turn, rallied finding clear running room in the two path straightening out for home and chased the winner in vain down the stretch to be a clear
second in the end. ASHBURY rated kindly on the rail tracking the front pair down the back straight, was nestled on the turn sitting behind the top two
leaders, shifted outside three wide posing a threat at the top of the lane, switched back to its outside lead at the eighth pole and gamely finished up to hold
for third at the wire. SOUPER SINCLAIR tracked three wide outside rivals down the backside in mid-pack, watched the engaged front duo three wide on the
turn, offered a mild rally to be in the mix in the four path straightening out on the stretch drive and was one paced in the final furlong for a minor share in the
end. RETAIL THERAPIST trailed on the rail in the early going, shifted outside starting a mild run at the three furlong marker, swung out widest in the six
path turning for home to be in range of the leaders, could not find more and offered little finish driving to the wire. CLOUD STORAGE took this field down the
backside, maintained a slim advantage through the turn, was collared by the winner outside at the top of the lane, offered little resistance and retreated on
the fence in mid-stretch.

CHROME'S ANGEL chased the pacesetter down the back straight, took control on the outside at the three furlong marker, opened up on horses at the top
of the stretch, rider lost her whip when roused right handed in upper stretch but had enough of an advantage in the lane to hold on comfortably at the finish.
SPEEDY JOHNY broke in at the start, trailing on the rail down the backstretch, began to extend her stride catching up to the field three wide two furlongs
from the prize, was bumped inside in upper stretch and was full of run in the last eighth not switching leads to be a non threatening second.
ONANDONANDON was pinballed between runners on the break, stalked near the rear down the backside, was checked briefly at the three eighths marker,
rallied between foes at the quarter pole, in tight with rivals on either side in the five path at the top of the lane and finished with intent while on the wrong
lead to the wire to get up late for third money. GOLD FORESTER broke out at the start, travelled three deep in midfield outside at the half, was coaxed for
more gaining on rivals midway on the turn, found a seam in the two path straightening out for home, battled for a small share down the lane but lost the nod
late for third, settling on the fringes in the end. BLONDE DYNAMO tracked the top duo on the rail down the back straight, was roused inside making little
impact on the fence three furlongs from the wire and could not get involved in the stretch run. CELTIC REVIVAL dictated the pace down the backside on the
rail, could not keep position up front when collared by the winner three furlongs from home, tried, but to not avail, chased the winner in upper stretch inside
but tired in the final furlong. MISS BIKINI travelled between runners in mid-pack down the backstretch, was hard ridden two wide on the turn going after the
front two but made little headway and emptied out in upper stretch. RIDERS CLIM OF FOUL #4 ONANDONANDON AGAINST #5 SPEEDY JOHNY AT
THE START WAS DISALLOWED

Footnotes
ROCKLAND EXPRESS reared up leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend, switched to the outside to launch a bid nearing the eighth pole and got up for the win late.
MISTER MESEEKS saved ground early, trailed the field up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the second turn, took over the
lead in midstretch and was caught after drifting out late. PERFECT PLAY bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, saved ground around the first
bend, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far turn in the four path and improved position late, racing into
traffic late and being forced to steady near the wire when MISTER MESEEKS drifted out. GROOM LAKE bumped with the horse to his outside at the start,
raced in the four path around the first turn, led the way on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and kept on to the finish.
BILL NEEDLE tracked the leaders on the outside through the opening half mile, continued around the far bend still in the three path, raced in tight quarters
entering the stretch and kept on to the wire. ROBITAILLE saved ground early, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch,
came around the second turn in the four path and was outkicked from there. QUIET REBEL raced off the pace in the three path around the first turn and up
the backstretch, began a bid approaching the half mile pole, led the field from the two path around the second turn and faded in the final furlong. HIP TO
YOUR TRICKS raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the pace setters on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three
path and tired in the lane. THE RIDER OF HORSE EIGHT, PERFECT PLAY, CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST BOTH HORSE THREE, MISTER MESEEKS AND
HORSE FOUR, ROCKLAND EMPRESS, CITING INTERFERENCE NEAR THE WIRE. UPON REVIEW, HORSE THREE, MISTER MESEEKS WAS
DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THIRD FOR INTERFERENCE.

Footnotes
EXUDE co-trailed on the inside under the wire for the first time, patiently galloped down the backstretch still seeing the field under a good hold, made a
strong turn of foot move swooping four wide in hand midway on the final turn, was set down for the drive with three sixteenths to go, drifted inwards some at
the furlong pole driving to the finish and got up in a well timed late surge at the wire. JUNIPERO SERRA set the pace under the wire for the first time while
pressed outside, continued to dictate terms while hounded down the backside, put away the pesky pace foe at the top of the lane, had another gear to spurt
away in upper stretch but could not hold off the fast closing winner late in a game front running effort. FLYSOFREEASHLEEB was allowed to settle seeing
the field in the first turn, co-trailed outside with one lap to run, improved to take closer order on the pack down the backstretch, rallied up the rail in the final
turn, shifted outside to the three path at the furlong pole and stubbornly finished up through the stretch for third. RUNAWAY CHARLIE pressed the issue
outside in the beginning, hounded the pacesetter down the backstretch, battled outside upfront on the far turn, continued to battle being in the hunt three
wide straightening out for home but weakened in the last furlong. HELIOCENTRIC travelled on the inside in the second flight in the early going, had a good
position alone watching the front two press each other down the backstretch, rallied inside midway on the final turn to be in with a chance in the three path
at the top of the lane but could not find more late and stalled in the final furlong. BIG WICKS tracked outside in the second flight, settled in midfield down the
backstretch could not keep pace between others offering a run with three furlongs to go and had little to show in the stretch drive. BIG SHOOTER stalked
near the rear in the beginning, made an early move three wide at the five furlong marker improving outside down the backstretch, closed in to just track
behind the co-leaders three wide with three eighths to run, could not sustain the run between rivals at the quarter pole and stopped in upper stretch.

Footnotes
PIONEER'S EDGE was allowed to gather herself trailing down the backside, started to gain momentum three wide three eighths from the finish, posed a
serious threat four wide outside runners turning for home and wore down the leader near the wire in a well judged late rally. MY SUNNY VALENTINE
tracked in mid-pack with runners on either side at the half, advanced smartly between foes midway on the turn, took command at the furlong pole edging
clear but could not hold off the late surge by the winner losing the nod at the finish line. SOUPER FLASHY was content to track the loose pacesetter down
the backside, waited on the rail behind the fading frontrunner at the quarter pole, shifted outside in the two path for the drive and determinedly finished up
through the stretch for third money. JAB settled in the midfield three deep outside with four furlongs to run, rallied three wide gaining outside of horses
through the turn, loomed in the three path at the top of the stretch, could not find another gear and was outkicked in deep stretch. SPIDER BELLE travelled
in the middle of the pack on the rail at the half, was shuffled back to trail on the fence three furlongs from the finish, could not extend her stride on the turn
waiting to run, was blocked in upper stretch and could not get clear until deep stretch but by that time it was too late. NOW IS A BREEZE stalked near the
rear on the rail, was roused for more run between horses three furlongs from the wire, could not get into contention down the lane but did pass the weary
pacesetter in the stretch. MICHELE M. pulled the rider to the lead down the backstretch, set the fractions on the turn but had a diminishing advantage at the
quarter pole, was swallowed up by outside runners in mid stretch and retreated when empty in the final furlong.

Footnotes
NATIVE PRINCE raced in the two path around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the second bend and dug in gamely in the
lane to hold the win. HELL BENT saved ground early, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the two
path coming around the far turn and chased the winner home in the stretch. ROCKET JOE COPPER saved ground around the first bend, raced in the
middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and improved position late. TIMESKIP raced in the
three path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace between horses, came around the far turn in the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole
and kept on from there. COLEYVILLE raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the three path,
switched inside in upper stretch and improved position mildly late. RELIABILITY was away from the gate slowly, raced in the two path at the back of the
pack around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the four path, swung wider still into the lane and was not a threat. FIRST
SPRING saved ground early, chased the leader up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and faded in the stretch.

STOLE THE RING dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and shook clear in the lane. HOT
OMELET chased the pace setter on the outside through the opening half mile, came around the turn in the two path, challenged approaching the quarter
pole and kept on to the wire. ITS A BIRDIE trailed the field through the early going, continued around the turn in the three and four path, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole and gained ground late. SHARP AZA RAINBOW raced off the pace on the inside early, came around the turn in the three path
and improved position mildly late. MENAGERIE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the two path and
finished evenly. MOON POOL raced off the pace on the outside through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the three path and never
threatend. WANNA PLAY hopped up leaving the gate, recovered to duel on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the
stretch.

TAYLORMOON chased the pace in the beginning, was coaxed for more run, getting a better forward position between horses with five furlongs remaining,
poked her head in front at the half, edged clear running on the turn and drew away convincingly in deep stretch. HARD ROCK WARRIOR stumbled on the
break, stalked near the back in the beginning, improved three deep outside runners down the back straight, circled four wide around horses midpoint on the
turn, posed the only threat to the winner in upper stretch but could not gain and settled for second best with a solid effort on this day. CASTLETON broke
out on the start, settled close to the back of the pack early, made a smart move saving all the ground following a fellow rival on the fence with five sixteenths
to run, found a seam in the two path turning for home, weaved through traffic in the final furlong and got up for the show money in the final jump. EVA'S
RECORD was checked briefly early on down the backstretch to stalk all alone with five furlongs to go, was on hold through the turn stuck behind a tiring
runner three furlongs from home, shifted out four wide midway on the turn commencing a run, swung out in the five path for the stretch run and closed in to
be involved in the minor placing in a three horse photo for third at the finish. T'PRING was reined back on the rail to have a tracking position at the half mile
marker, nestled on the inside keeping pace with the leaders on the fence running through the turn, battled inside for a share driving to the wire and faded
late losing third money in a photo at the finish. ALCOM'SOUTINTHWASH was outside three deep in the third flight tracking the leaders five eighths from the
finish, rallied four wide improving around runners three furlongs from the finish, battled between foes at the quarter pole for the runners up share and stalled
in the final furlong. SMART IRENE stalked near the rear in the early going, made a brief run progressing nicely on the rail throughout the turn to be in range
for a small share at the top of the lane and gave way on the fence in mid-stretch. ELECTRIC LIGHTNING trailed the field down the backside, caught up to
runners four wide on the outside at the quarter pole, angled out widest in the seven path for the drive but could not be a presence running to the finish line.
BLACKMARSH tracked in the third flight inside five eighths from the wire, was urged making an early more between runners tracking the front duo at the
half, scrubbed on three wide with horses on each side losing position three furlongs out and retreated in midturn. FRAULEIN VICTORIA had the early lead
leaving the chute, was roused with rivals on either side but could not keep pace chasing the winner three furlongs from home and backed through the field
with a quarter mile to run.
