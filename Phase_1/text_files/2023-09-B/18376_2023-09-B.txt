Footnotes
CANTUCCI broke inwards to begin, pressed inside down the back straight, took command bursting through on the rail with five sixteenths to go, opened up
straightening out for the drive, raced greenly down the lane ducking in when urged at the sixteenth pole and comfortably drew away for the win at the wire.
GUARDTHEROCK settled inside keeping tabs on the engaging threesome tracking throughout the turn, began to take closer order at the quarter pole,
surged on the fence in upper stretch, chased the winner but to no avail to the wire and stubbornly held besting the rest in the end. CONTRIVANCE
prompted three deep down the backside, forced the pace three wide outside through the turn, was in the hunt between horses in lane four at the top of the
stretch, drifted out driving to the wire at the eighth pole and was gaining late just missing second money in the end. BE ON NOTICE was in a good spot
outside runners tracking the contesting trio up front down the backstretch and throughout the turn, was roused to go on shifting outside turning for home five
wide for clear run, was steadied when losing its path at the furlong pole and could not regroup in time to threaten at the wire. ZODIAC BEACH broke with
the field but had no early foot trailing down the backside, could see the field but was starting to gain on rivals on the turn and showed some late interest
passing weary foes down the lane. OH PEANUTS stalked near the rear on the rail, made no progression running inside throughout the turn and could not
get involved in the drive to the finish. SQUEEZETHESHARMAN was off a step slow to begin, then was hustled between horses to have a slim advantage at
the half mile marker, was roused for more to keep up with the other contesting rivals up front on either side at the quarter pole, offered little response and
stopped on the fence at the furlong marker. STEWARDS INQUIRY AND RCOF #7 BE ON NOTICE AGAINST # 5 CONTRIVANCE IN MID-STRETCH
RESULTED IN #5 CONTRIVANCE BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE

Footnotes
FANORE (IRE) was quick to take the lead, set the pace inside racing in hand, asked past the quarter pole while clear, held safe. GIOVANNINO settled
between runners mid-pack, advanced mildly three wide on the turn, was no match for the winner but second best. JAGGERSGOTAGUN broke awkwardly,
raced between foes two to three deep at the rear, came out near the sixteenth pole for room and ran on to get up for show. BIG SHOOTER pursued the
winner just off that one's flank two to three wide, lacked the needed late kick and lost show honors late. CHASING TROUBLE veered out at the break,
settled outside mid-pack, went four to five wide on the turn, ran on evenly and made no bid. PROUD RONIN tracked from inside mid-division, failed to rally.
DARE TO BE KING broke just a half-step slowly, raced outside at the rear, moved out from four to six wide on the turn, came into upper stretch seven deep,
had no rally. POLITICAL WARFARE broke just a half-step slowly, settled at the back inside, was not a threat.

Footnotes
WEALLLIKEDHIM was content to track the loose speedster down the backside, took closer order by the quarter pole, was in the hunt three wide at the top
of the lane and finished up determinedly between rivals in a well rated ride for the win. SO CALLED VACATION travelled in midpack in the beginning, could
see the field entering the turn, advanced smartly on the fence through the turn, began to lengthen stride in the two path turning for home, was steadied in
tight quarters at the furlong pole losing momentum and could not re-rally to gain on the winner in deep stretch. COHERENCE trailed four deep at the half,
circled around foes four wide at the quarter pole, loomed in the four path at the top of the stretch but could not find another gear late and stalled nearing the
wire to settle for third in the end. SUGARTAP was loose on the lead down the backstretch, continued to set brisk fractions up front through the turn, was
shortening stride asking for the wire turning for home, drifted out while giving way at the furlong marker and held for a minor share at the wire. DEMBA
settled near the rear with rivals on either side at the half, was asked to keep position between foes midway on the turn, could not quicken with others and
lacked a bid driving to the finish line. SOVEREIGN CAUSE tossed its head right on the break, hesitated at the start spotting the field in the early going,
recovered by the half mile marker to track the front two down the backside, shifted outside with three furlongs remaining but retreated through the turn to
see the field inside at the quarter pole, re-rallied mildly in upper stretch on the fence and emptied out in the final sixteenth. STEWARDS INQUIRY
REGARDING #4 SOVEREIGN CAUSE ON THE BREAK WAS DEEMED TO HAVE RECIEVED A FAIR START. RCOF #1 SO CALLED VACATION ON #2
WEALLLIKEDHIM IN THE VICINITY OF THE EIGHTH POLE RESULTED IN NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
HILARIOUS AFFAIR exchanged light contact at the start, switched out racing at the back early, made a swift early move outside three to four wide early on
the turn drawing nearly even past the three-eighths, finally took command by the three-sixteenths, edged clear under steady urging. UNCAPTURED
MOMENT pursued from mid-pack going three wide on the turn, was ridden along strongly from the three-eighths, came out a bit for the drive, was no match
for the winner but got the place. DISSECTOLOGIST exchanged a bump at the start, shifted to the rail late up the backstretch racing about mid-pack, came
out near the furlong grounds, rallied between runners to get show honors. SOCIETY'S THUNDER exchanged bumps at the start, moved forward inside
keenly, lacked room along the rail in upper and mid-stretch, finally had clear sailing coming to the sixteenth pole but was too late. SOUPER SUNSHINE
prompted the very early pace then raced up close just off the leader, went two to four wide throughout and ran on evenly late. PUDDINGONTHERITZ
contested the pace inside on or just off the rail, weakened late. JIMMIES BIG DAY switched off the inside heading to the turn, went three wide on that bend
at the back, swung out seven to eight deep, failed to menace. OLD BLUE CLIFF was forced wide into the turn racing outside foes four to five deep, was
never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
BRAVE DANCER pulled the rider to press for the lead inside down the backside, edged up to take control in hand with three furlongs from home, opened up
comfortably at the quarter pole and drew away when set down in the final furlong. HATMAKER GIZMO hopped at the start, rated kindly on the fence down
the backstretch, burst between foes rallying in the two path entering the stretch, shifted out four wide for the drive to the wire but chased the winner in vain
to the finish clearly second best on this day. AWESOME ENTRY trailed the field down the backstretch, was roused midpoint on the turn picking up runners,
swung outside in the five path finding his best stride late and closed in to capture third at the wire. LONHRO'S GAMBLE made an early move four deep
outside horses at the five eighths pole for better position down the backside, tracked the front duo outside with three furlongs remaining, was in range if
good enough in the five path straightening out for the drive, evened out in mid-stretch and settled for minor role in the end. BAR TALK leapt up at the start,
had a slim advantage down the backstretch outside, came under a ride trying to match strides with the winner that was pulling away midway on the turn and
gave way chasing the leader between horses at the eighth pole finishing on the wrong lead to the wire. INDY COWBOY travelled between horses in midfield
down the backside, put in a mild run on the fence with five sixteenths to go, was in with a chance for a piece of the prize on the rail turning for home but
could not find more and yielded on the rail at the furlong marker. NEEDS FULFILLED stalked near the rear three wide down the back straight, made little
headway running on the turn and had nothing to give in the drive to the finish line.

Footnotes
TIME TO DAZZLE was keen early then settled in tracking in behind the leaders just off the rail into the turn, moved out four wide turning into upper stretch,
took the lead by the three-sixteenths, kicked clear while drifting in and was kept to the task. BANDWAGON soon led, set the pace racing just off the rail, was
overtaken in upper stretch, no match but second best. OSCARSSON tracked from between runners mid-pack, went three wide on the turn, came out five
wide in upper stretch, was no threat to the top pair. MOTION GRANTED broke outwardly, raced at the back, went four then five wide on the turn, swung out
eight to nine wide for the drive, ran on to get up for the super. MATICULANT stalked in range of the leaders racing outside four deep on the turn, floated six
to seven wide turning for home, lacked the needed late kick. SWIFT DELIVERY broke a step slowly, lacked significant early speed, raced inside and failed
to threaten. CATHOLIC JACKIE had a brief early lead, ceded that advantage under moderate hold content to press, went about three wide on the turn,
weakened thereafter.

Footnotes
MEYER galloped along on the inside under a relaxed stride under the finish line for the first time, shifted three wide outside foes on the second turn,
improved down the backside outside of runners, made a sharp move with three furlongs to go circling horses, bid for the lead outside at the quarter pole and
home something left to hold safe at the finish. LIL BIT GANGSTA stalked in the two path in the early stages of the race, began to quicken outside horses
following the path of the winner three wide on the final turn, shifted outside in the four path for the drive, was gaining late but could not get there in time.
RON'S GIZMO emerged with the lead into the first turn, continued to dictate a moderate pace slowing in down bunching up the field under the finish for the
first time, open up mildly down the backstretch, was hard ridden when collared by the winner two furlongs out, battled stubbornly to the furlong marker and
gave way holding for third. CANADIAN PHAROAH was allowed to settle trailing the field around the oval until three furlongs from home, began rallying
catching up to runners outside with a quarter mile from home and closed strong on others to settle on the fringes in the end. CONGLOMERATE settled in
midfield three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace three wide outside horses with seven eighths remaining, continued to hound the leaders three wide
down the back straight and had no finish to give in the stretch for the final time fading at the furlong marker. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION nestled on the rail
behind the leader in the early going, became shuffled back on the fence in the second turn losing positions and finished up with interest on the rail to pass
tired runners down the lane. KIDDIE HOLIDAY settled in midpack two wide between horses, had a good position on the rail in the second of three turns
watching the front trio, was roused on the fence three eighths to go, offered no response and faded in upper stretch. JUST START ME UP was content to
watch the frontrunner in the beginning, pressed the pace between horses under the wire for the first time, was asked for more but could not accelerate with
rallying foes three furlongs from the finish, tired on the far turn and was empty to the wire.

Footnotes
MAGIC SLIPS moved straight to the lead, set the pace facing outside pressure, was further engaged at the top of the stretch, dueled inside that one while
drifting out, held under steady handling. NANTUCKETS DAY pressed from between runners, drew even at the top of the stretch, dueled till late while being
carried out a bit, was outfinished but second best. NO MORE OPTIONS tracked from inside just off the leaders, kept on steadily but one-paced through the
drive. JO DADDY was forced in and steadied at the start, moved up inside a rival early on the turn, was guided out three to four deep about the
three-eighths, swung out further coming into upper stretch seven wide, showed good late energy but needed more. ENGLISH JUBILEE broke a step slowly
and was shut off at the start, was allowed to settle at the back, saved ground on the turn beginning to advance, swung out for the drive then shifted in a bit
in upper stretch for room, finished best but too late. WELLER GREEN was outsprinted early, raced in the back half of the field outside a foe two to three
deep, moved out with that one going four to five wide past the three-eighths, came out further in upper stretch with much to do, ran on. HARD DIAMOND
was bumped then came in at the start, raced outside a foe mid-pack two wide through the turn, shifted out turning for home then back in oncei n upper
stretch, ran on but needed more. LAKEFIELD bumped with a rival and was forced in at the start, was forwardly-placed stalking outside a foe two to three
wide, faded. GAROFOLI broke out a bit, pressed from outside, went three to four wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch. THOR'S CAUSE settled inside
mid-pack, came up empty. HIGHLAND ROCKY raced off the inside and was outpaced.

relaxed behind the front pair on the turn, burst between horses when the seam in the three path opened up, bid outside for the lead at the furlong pole,
switched leads and responded to urging to comfortably hold for the victory at the wire. MILLIE GIRL stalked at the back of the pack on the rail, progressed
nicely on the fence throughout the turn, slipped through on the inside turning for home and gamely chased the winner, never giving in to the wire and
besting the rest in the end. IL MALOCCHIO travelled three deep in midfield at the half, was nudged midpoint on the turn keeping pace with rivals, fanned out
widest in the seven path for the drive and was reaching for ground passing runners in the final sixteenth with a late surge. TICKER TAPE HOME was reined
back to watch the contesting pair at the half, tracked the dueling co-leaders two wide on the outside throughout the turn, angled outside to be in the hunt at
the top of the stretch in the five path if good enough but could not find another gear late and was one paced in deep stretch. VANTARSI showed speed to
press lead on the inside down the backstretch, had a slim advantage on the turn running on the rail, put away the early speed foe at the top of the lane,
courageously battled until the eighth pole and faded in the final seventy yards. HAZELBROOK travelled near the rear in the two path between horses down
the backside, advanced splitting foes with seven sixteenths from home, continued to creep closer at the quarter pole in the third flight, angled out for the
stretch run in the six path but offered no late rally flattening out in mid-stretch. TALK TO YA LATER trailed four deep at the half outside runners, made little
impression four wide around foes through the turn and showed some late energy to put in a mild run in the final furlong. HAI BOBBI set the fractions down
the backstretch having a slim advantage on the outside, pressed for the lead running around the bend, gave way while drifting out in the four path
straightening for the drive and weakened in the final furlong. PURRFECT settled in midpack three deep down the backside, was asked to quicken with
others under a ride three furlongs from home, could not keep up, was then urged right handed midway on the turn, offered no run and could not get involved
running to the finish line.

PERHAPS TONIGHT (IRE) settled off the pace shifting in, raced off the leaders three wide between on the turn, waited briefly near the five-sixteenths, was
in a tad tight at the quarter pole then came out seven wide in upper stretch, quickened once clear, taking the lead about the eighth pole and forged clear.
KEYFLOWER (FR) tracked just off the leaders from inside, came out five wide in upper stretch, was in contention coming to the eighth pole, was no match
for the winner, just saved the place. BATYAH settled at the rear racing off the inside in the four path on the turn, rallied between runners four to five wide in
the stretch, missed second. PEMBERLEY settled mid-pack off the pace, kept on inside to improve position late. TOERIS soon lead, set the pace racing very
wide early, moved nearer but still off the rail heading to the turn, was headed leaving the turn, fought back to retake a narrow and brief lead past the quarter
pole but could not sustain the effort and lacked the needed late kick. SILVER MAGNATIZED switched off the inside heading into the turn, raced between
foes toward the back four wide, swung out ten wide turning for home, ran on mildly. MY GIRL SKY stalked just off the leaders, encouraged along about the
seven-sixteenths, moved out from three to five wide on the turn and wider still for the drive, failed to rally. WHIMSICAL DANCE stalked from outside just off
the leader, bid three wide coming past the five-sixteenths taking a narrow lead, flattened out past the quarter and faded. MYRISKYAFFAIR raced outside at
the back five to seven wide through the turn advancing a bit, came out a bit further into upper stretch, failed to menace.

AIM FOR THE SKY was hustled to get the lead down the backside, set the fractions while hounded outside running on the turn, edged away from the
chasing rival on the fence at the furlong marker and had just enough left in reserve to hold off the closer at the finish. FORESTER'S FORTUNE stalked
close to the back of the pack in the beginning, saved ground on the turn waiting behind a wall of runners at the quarter pole, found a seam in the four path in
the final eighth and closed with a flurry late to just miss at the finish. FOUR ACES HIGH chased the frontrunner down the back straight, pressed the winner
outside through the turn, battle three wide up front down the lane and gave way grudgingly nearing the wire settling for third in the end. WARP RIDE stalked
near the rear five deep down the backside, roused five wide on the turn making little progress, angled out in the seven path at the top of the stretch and
closed late for a minor share in the final furlong. GALVASTON tracked the front duo three wide down the back straightaway, chased the leading pair two
wide on turn to be in range straightening out for home, fought on through the stretch but faded in the final seventy yards. TRICKY MAGICIAN tracked the
front pair four deep down the backstretch, lost ground to rivals running four wide throughout the turn, angled outside six wide for the finish and ran on mildly
between horses to the wire. SPITE STORE was checked mildly on the fence to be shuffled back some at the half inside, was in tight fighting for position
between runners in midfield on the turn, rallied to be in the mix for a share two wide straightening out for the drive, dug in between rivals in upper stretch but
faded in late nearing the wire. WESTERN TROUBLE was pinched at the start trailing down the backside, could still see the field through the turn, had no
room to run looking for a seam in upper stretch and could not get involved running to the wire. FEELTHEBEAT was on the rail watching the top two runners
down the backside, kept pace on the fence keeping a close eye on the dueling leaders through the turn, was roused inside having clear run at the top of the
lane but lacked a bid in the drive to the wire. GHOUL (BRZ) was reined back five deep in midfield at the half, improved making a mild run three wide
between runners with five sixteenths to go, continued to be scrubbed on entering the stretch to have a chance for a small piece of the prize five wide, could
not offer a finish and tired in the last eighth.
