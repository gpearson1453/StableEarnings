Footnotes
SCRUPULOUS bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, tipped out and took aim outside of the embattled leading pair in upper
stretch, ranged up to them in the final furlong, drove past nearing the sixteenth pole and drew clear. END OF INNOCENCE broke outwardly, advanced to
prompt the pace three wide, then two wide into the turn, bid and vied around the bend, sustained the duel through midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer
rival with a sixteenth to go and edged his inner counterpart for place. WHATTA WORLD bumped with an inner rival upon leaving the gates, showed the way
along the inside, sparred with an outer bidder around the turn, gamely clung to an advantage through midstretch, but yielded to his outer counterpart and a
wider bidder at the sixteenth pole. INTERCEPTION prompted the pace two wide and between horses for a quarter mile, backed of between the top pair to
stalk them nearing the turn, got coaxed along turning for home before spinning for home three wide, but hung on his left lead thereafter and lacked a bid.
BETTE DAVIS leaned inwardly while off a step slow, bobbled moments after the start before the rider took a hard hold to keep from hitting the inner rail,
trailed in the aftermath, moved out of last two to three wide nearing the lane and stayed on. NO VIOLENCE lacked a response to urging while off of the pace
in the two to three path around the turn, yet improved between horses in the final furlong. LOVEYA LOVEYA MORE chased from midpack in the three to
two path around the turn and weakened. HUSH IT HONEY tracked three wide, then weakened in the four path in upper stretch. SUMMER DANCE was off a
step slow, lacked speed along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
ASTRONOMICO set the pace along the inside, built a clear margin leaving the nine sixteenths pole, showed the way loose and in hand around the turn,
responded readily once set down in upper stretch and held sway through the final furlong. WAUHATCHIE settled at the rear along the inside, shifted two
wide at the three furlong pole, fanned five wide entering the lane and rallied outside of foes to reach place in the shadow of the wire. TIZ MY HERO pursued
from midpack two wide and between horses, shifted inwardly approaching the three furlong pole, advanced inside of rivals to gain place at the five
sixteenths pole, tipped off the rail while chasing the clear leader in upper stretch, but failed to gain on that one before being caught for place by an outer
bidder in the closing stages. MONEYSHOT stalked three wide and between horses, failed to keep pace two wide in upper stretch and lacked a bid. HOPE
JOE'S RIGHT lacked speed three wide, tucked to the inside with three furlongs to go, tipped back to the three path in upper stretch and improved position in
the final furlong. SKYPASS was a bit antsy in the starting gate then broke in the air while not being costed early position, pressed two wide leaving the
chute, but failed to sustain pressure moving to the half mile pole, chased into the turn, moved inwardly in upper stretch and weakened. LEAD FOOT tracked
from midpack four wide around the turn and weakened. DON'T STOP tracked along the inside, but faltered out of cramped rail quarters entering the turn
and was outrun thereafter. PER RULING ECM2023-181 FROM HIWU, WAUHATCHIE HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A
POSITIVE TEST. PER WITHDRAWAL LETTER FROM HIWU, THE DISQUALIFICATION OF WAUHATCHIE WAS REVERSED.

Footnotes
CANDY LANDY leaned outwardly, bumped an outer rival and caused cramped quarters for multiple foes exiting the chute, set the pace inside of a pair of
prompting foes, sparred with them turning for home, battled with an outer MUGEN in upper stretch, exchanged light contact while getting slightly headed
with three sixteenths to go, but gamely reclaimed an advantage at the furlong grounds, shook free in the final sixteenth and lasted from a pair of outer
on-charging bidders late. FLOORED transferred contact from an inner rival to outer foes leaving the chute, stalked the leading trio from the two path, tipped
outside of them in upper stretch, lacked true progress in pursuit of the embattled leading pair through midstretch, yet kicked in once an outer WEST OMAHA
rallied alongside in the final furlong, surged late along with that foe and narrowly prevailed over her in the place photo while gaining on the leader. WEST
OMAHA brushed with an inner rival leaving the chute, settled off of the pace two wide, shifted six wide and between horses in upper stretch, offered a strong
late kick outside of rivals in the final furlong, but ran out of ground to reel in the leader and just missed reaching place. MUGEN prompted the pace three
wide, vied turning for home, sparred with an inner CANDY LANDY in upper stretch, wrestled a narrow advantage with exchanging a shoulder-to-shoulder
brush with that one at the three sixteenths pole, but relinquished the advantage to his inner counterpart at the furlong grounds, failed to keep pace in the
final sixteenth and was surpassed by a pair of outer rivals nearing the wire. CLASS ACT was void of speed, raced far back in the three path before fanning
seven wide entering the lane, failed to match rallying strides with an inner rival moving to midstretch, yet stayed on for a minor share. AUSTIN TRAFFIC got
bumped between horses and steadied in crowded quarters at the thirteen sixteenths pole, pursued from midpack along the inside and chased evenly.
FUNDAMENTALLY tracked four wide, came under coaxing at the three furlong pole, floated five wide into the lane and gave way between horses.
CONTROLLED TEMPER vied for the lead two wide and between rivals, but folded in upper stretch. LITTLE MISS PRISS laid off of the pace in the three
path, moved between horses leaving the three furlong pole, and weakened. BABE IN THE WOODS got pinched between horses inside the thirteen
sixteenths pole, lost her rider exiting the chute and was vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE INCIDENT LEAVING THE
CHUTE, CANDY LANDY WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST.

Footnotes
AIN'T BROKE broke half a beat slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out around the far turn, fanned to the five path while picking up stride
entering the lane, rallied outside of foes to take aim on the new leader in the final sixteenth, ranged up to that one late and gained an advantage at the wire.
THESTRAL tracked from the four path, crept closer turning for home, offered a bid in upper stretch, led at the furlong grounds, edged away entering the final
sixteenth as an outer AIN'T BROKE pursued and was reeled in by that one at the wire. SANDRA D took contact from rivals on both sides at the start, set the
pace inside of a prompting foe while remaining a path off of the inside, embraced an outer challenge in upper stretch, got headed at the furlong grounds and
kept on. SUCH SOUNDS brushed an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside but only managed to chase through the lane. MYTOWN MYRULES
prompted the leader from the three path while under snug restraint, yet came under an all out drive to sustain pressure with three furlongs to go, yielded
entering the lane and faded between horses. SAD CAFE leaned inwardly and bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked two wide and between horses,
pursued in hand in the three path around the far turn, entered the lane in the four path and between horses, but lacked a bid, then faltered and was eased
up in the final sixteenth. STEEL RACER raced at the rear three wide and got outrun.

Footnotes
GIN GIN set the pace along the inside, dueled with an outer bidder turning for home, gamely clung to an advantage in upper stretch, shook free entering the
final furlong and held sway. CARARRA pressed the leader from the three path into the turn, bid turning for home, dueled in upper stretch, but was turned
away while subtly drifting out at the furlong grounds, wandered back inwardly while resenting a right handed crop at the sixteenth pole, then saved place
from an outer bidder late. AMERICA'S VOW stalked close up in the two path, chased the embattled leading pair in upper stretch, shifted ground outwardly at
the furlong grounds, ran on through the late stages but missed reaching place. PERFECT SHOT transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the
start, pursued from midpack in the four to five path, and lacked a bid while chasing evenly through the lane. FLIGHT TO PARIS broke a step slow, raced off
of the pace in the four path and moved up. PLATINUM MINIT tracked in the two wide and between horses, subtly failed to sustain position around the turn,
yet kept on through the lane. DAZZLIN' DICTATOR broke a step slow, raced at the rear two wide, fanned to the five path entering the lane and moved up.
NANDINA lacked speed two to three wide and between horses and failed to factor. MONTCLAIR ROAD stalked in the four path, pressed outside of the top
pair from that path around the turn, but yielded turning for home and weakened between horses. AMY Z bumped an outer rival at the start, pursued from
midpack along the inside, but was gradually shuffled back behind PLATINUM MINIT around the turn, steadied in tight quarters inside of that one nearing the
quarter made and failed to make an impact. MAGIC GATHERING took light contact rom an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside and
failed to factor. MISS HARMONIC was outrun along the inside.

stretch, held sway while beginning to tire in the final sixteenth and lasted to the wire. THE GREAT MAYBE prompted the pace three wide, got outmoved by
an inner rival turning for home, chased that one through midstretch, kept on along with an outer rival to rebid between horses in the final sixteenth, but
missed. HUNTRESS FOR HIRE broke a step slow tracked two wide and between horses entering the turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, sustained a
steady grind in pursuit of the top pair in the final furlong, attempted a late bid but ran out of ground and came up short. ERVADEAN moved off of the inside
whilst midpack at the five furlong pole, but was brushed by an inner CANCEL THIS at the half mile pole, gained in the bit into the turn to press the leading
trio turning for home, but entered the lane in the five path, failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch and chased them home. PISTOL stalked
along the inside, then chased in the three path while one paced through the lane. LITTLE MOMBO bumped with an outer rival at the start, set the pace
along the inside, but was headed while inside of a trio of foes at the five sixteenths pole and weakened. SECRET STATEMENT pursued from midpack in
the five to six path and tired. CANCEL THIS tracked in the two path, moved out before brushing an outer rival at the half mile pole, pursued from the four
path around the turn and gave way. IN COLOR laid off of the pace in the four path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane and failed to factor. TEN
RINGS broke a step slow then failed to factor along the inside. NEED SOME MONEY never got involved from the three path. VARMLANDER bumped with

Footnotes
GASOLINE tracked two wide and between horses, chased the leader from the four path in upper stretch, flopped back to his left lead at the furlong grounds
as that foe shifted across his path, yet sustained stride to bid along with an outer rival while changing back to his correct lead at the sixteenth pole, sparred
among foes through the late stages and prevailed. DECISION MAKER was bumped by an inner rival at the start, raced at the rear two wide, picked up stride
while shifting to the five to six path around the far turn, rallied outside of foes through the lane to offer a bid at the sixteenth pole, but was fended off by an
inner rival. SANTOS DUMONT bumped an outer rival at the start before being sent to the fore approaching the first turn, set the pace along the inside,
inched a clear advantage around the far turn, shifted to the two path in upper stretch, held sway while drifting out momentarily at the furlong grounds, but
bore out further nearing the sixteenth pole while a pair of rivals on either side menaced, then got bested by the outer set before fending off inner rivals for
show. SPEED BIAS tracked four wide, but yielded between horses turning for home, yet shifted down two wide, kept on entering the final furlong, sustained
progress to attempt a bid entering the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an outer pair and denied reaching show. ETHICAL JUDGEMENT was hustled
out of the gates, stalked along the inside, chased around the far turn, sustained a rail grind to attempt a mild bid inside of rivals at the sixteenth pole, but
flattened out. MASQUEPARADE lacked speed in the three path, gained five wide around the far turn, but leveled off between horses. MR. BIG NEWS raced
at the rear along the inside, took the far turn in the four path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane and failed to factor. GALT stalked forwardly three
wide and between horses around the first turn, but was relegated back to midpack entering the backstretch and faded. KING'S OVATION pressed two wide
but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole. GROUP EIGHTEEN made little impact from the two path. PROMISE KEEPER got outrun.

MO FIGHT tracked along the inside, tipped out to take aim outside of the leading trio entering the lane, drove past them in upper stretch and kicked away at
the furlong grounds. SPIELMAN trailed in the three to four path, fanned to the six path entering the lane, rallied outside of foes to gain place coming to
midstretch and was second best. SINGLE DOT YAHT laid off of the pace in the three path, shied to the five path at the five sixteenths pole, got outmoved by
an outer rival in upper stretch yet kept on to gain show in the final furlong. HERO'S MEDAL laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path in
midstretch and moved up late. ARCHIE THE GIZA tracked four wide, bid with three furlongs to go, vied until quickly proving no match for an outer bidder in
upper stretch and gave way. CONCERTED stalked two wide, bid under an all out drive along with an outer pair passing the three furlong pole, but
weakened along the inside in upper stretch. SHOWDOWN KING tracked three wide and between horses, bid at the three furlong pole, vied turning for
home, but weakened in upper stretch. DESERT WOLF laid off of the pace along the inside, steadied inside of rivals leaving the chute and faded around the
