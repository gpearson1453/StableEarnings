on the turn but weakened in the drive. TERRIBLEIGH tracked the pace three wide and tired. FAST FREEZE KAZ was away alertly to set a pressured pace

Footnotes
MAGIC SPIN set a pressured pace on the inside, made a bid to shake clear leaving the turn, then widened the margin to the wire to prove best, driving.
HEADS OR TAILS chased the pace along the inside, then finished willingly to be second best. NICE WEATHER pressed the pace three wide and faded in
the drive, held show award. DON'T LOSEMYMONEY tracked the early pace in between rivals, made a mild four wide bid by the quarter pole but weakened
in the drive. BEYOND THE BEND was reserved early, saved ground on the turn and had a belated rally on the inside. YES SIR ROBERT chased the pace
three to four wide and then was empty. ANNAMATED MOON was settled on the inside and dropped back. ZILLION was not a threat.

Footnotes
MILLBANK MAN was well rated early, made a three wide move on the turn, then drew clear in the furlong grounds to prove best, mild drive. KAZ
MUNNINGS stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn in hand, took over leaving the quarter pole, then could not go with the winner in
the final furlong, second best. SUMMER ASH was settled back early, advanced five wide on the turn, came wide into the lane and was along for the show
award. WICKED IRISHMAN hit the gate and was off slowly, then advanced four wide on the turrn, but lacked a rally while besting the rest. NOTORIOUS
REY lacked a rally. BRANTLEYS BIG GUN was reserved early, three wide by the quarter pole, dropped to the inside in the lane and had no rally. HE IS
BAD set a fast pace on the inside and was headed on the turn and faltered. LUCKY LEWIS pressed the pace two wide and then was empty.
