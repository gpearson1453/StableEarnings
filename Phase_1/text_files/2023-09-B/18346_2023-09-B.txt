Footnotes
FLIGHT CATCHER was steadied around the first turn and tracked under a hold in the two path down the backside, waited inside of rivals rounding the far
turn, had to check turning into the lane, angled out to the five path passing the eighth pole, and ran on to get up in the final strides. MY GREAT ILLUSION
stalked in the three path, bid going into the far turn, kept on from the three path while on his left lead in upper stretch and took the lead passing the eighth
pole, but was caught in the closing stages by an outer foe to place. PEYTON'S DAY trailed in the three path, was driven in the four path around the far turn,
swung out to the six path into the lane, and rallied but ran out of time to finish with show. AWESOME FRIEND was keen to go on early and steadied around
the first turn while setting the pace in the two path going into the backstretch, was roused early into the far turn, dug in along the rail entering the stretch, but
yielded in the final furlong. DECISIVE WARRIOR hopped at the start, rated in the five path down the backstretch, tipped in to the three path and was under
coaxing early into the far turn, but did not threaten. DREAM BELIEVER chased in the four path but was empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
EMBER was off a bit slowly, trailed two and three wide around the first turn, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid three deep midway around the far
turn, vied to midstretch while continuing on the left lead, drew clear and drifted in leaving the eighth pole and widened under mild late urging. BLUTO'S
CANDY settled off the early pace three wide, made progress down the backstretch, bid two wide between foes around the far turn, could not match strides
with the winner in the final furlong, lightly steadied when that foe drifted in in front of him near the sixteenth pole, tipped out and held second. SUPER
SPREADER was bumped at the start, saved ground in range, tipped three wide near the quarter pole and gained the show.. HOLIDAY FANTASY chased
the pace two and three wide and finished evenly to improve position. CAPTURETHELAUGHTER set the pace inside and tired in the stretch. TEPPER raced
off the pace inside, angled four wide near the three-eighths marker and lacked a rally. AMBUSHED broke outwardly and bumped at the start then made little
further impact while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
SEBARAY rated in the six path, loomed up to bid in the five path midway around the turn, led while angling in to the four path at the top of the lane, dueled
with an inner foe down the lane, and inched away in the closing stages. GRAND ROCK was fractious in the gate, prompted the pace in the four path, bid
between foes passing the three eighths pole, ran on and dueled with an outer foe from the three entering the stretch, but was edged out in the final sixteenth
to place. NO MORE DEBT tracked in the two path, was put to a drive in the three path around the turn, floated out to the six path into the stretch, and kept
on for show. DUKE SKYWALKER trailed in the three path early and made no impact while on his left lead down the lane. ACTION DREAM was fractious in
the gate, chased in the five path, was under urging around the turn, and did not factor from out around the eight path in the stretch. SHARP AZ NAILS was
wellback along the rail early and never threatened. BLUE LIEUTENANT set the pace from the three path into the turn, but gaveway in the two path turning
into the stretch.

NO DELIBERATION dueled inside of HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH and edged ahead in the final furlong. HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH dueled outside of the
winner and was outfinished. ETERNAL FLAME raced off the pace pace along the rail, angled three wide nearing the eighth pole and could only gain slightly
from there. SMOKIN CLOUD settled off the pace while racing three wide and improved position without threatening in the lane. FORT ATTITUDE was
fractious in the gate, had early speed between foes, checked entering the turn, raced two wide around the bend, tipped three wide turning for home and
lacked a closing bid. THE RED MAN tracked the pace four wide and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
SQUINTS tracked in the six path, tipped into the four path and was driven around the turn, went back out to the six path entering the stretch, and rallied to
get up on the wire. ECHO LANE bobbled at the start, chased from the rail, was stymied behind the leader rounding the turn, shifted out to the four path in
upper stretch, ran on to briefly lead in the final sixteenth, but was nailed by an outer foe on the wire to place. ARROGANCY prompted the pace in the three
path, was ridden around the turn, bid from the two path into the stretch, led passing the eighth pole and brushed with an inner foe, but evened out for show.
STRATEGY JAK was hustled along off the pace in the six path, checked passing the five eighths, fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, and
finished evenly. THEMANUPFRONT set the pace in the two path, was roused into the turn, tipped to the rail turning into the lane, brushed with an outer foe
passing the eighth pole, and faded. NEVER SAY NEVER brushed with an outer foe at the start, then checked early and trailed in the five path, was ridden in
the seven path turning into the stretch, but made no impact. GO BILLY GO stalked in the four path early, but lost ground early around the turn, and did not
factor. SAYBROOK was pinched at the start, rated but lugged out to the seven path around the five eighths, received right handed cues in the six path
around the turn, but was tired entering the stretch. EMBRACE THE DREAM was wellback in the three path and did not threaten. SABIAN broke in and
bumped an inner foe, pressed in the four path but gaveway turning into the stretch. HALON was wellback in the three path and never menaced.

BATTLE CRY tracked the pace two wide, took over leaving the eighth pole and drove clear. SWOONATRA set a clear pace along the rail, led past the
eighth and was clearly second best late. SANDPIPER MEMORIES raced off the pace three and four wide and was along for the show. STREAKING GREY
was rank at the start, remained rank through most of the opening half mile, saved ground in midpack and lacked a closing bid. LADY JAE came out and
bumped GRATIA soon after the start, raced off the pace three and four wide and never threatened. KHOSEA chased the pace two and three wide and
faded through the lane. GRATIA broke slowly then was bumped soon after and was never involved while racing three and four wide. BARBARA was hard
held inside and was through after a half.

KING SKULL stalked in the four path, bid early around the turn, took the lead and opened up from the three path into the lane, and held safe under a drive.
ROAR READY had a slow start and raced wellback in the in the two path, was ridden in the four path turning into the stretch, and ran on while on his left
lead for place. IMPROPTUDE steadied early, raced off the pace in the three path, was under coaxing in the five path around the turn, fanned out to the
seven path into the stretch, and kept on for show. AMARANTO rated in the five path, tipped in to the two path and was cued early around the turn, went
back out to the four path turning into the lane, but was one paced. SIMSOUM chased in the four path but flattened from the six path down the lane.
FULANITO set the pace in the two path, was challenged by the winner passing the three eighths, and yielded from inside at the top of the lane. GO GO
SANTI broke out at the start, then trailed throughout from the two to three paths.

Footnotes
POWER HUMOR stalked in the four path, took command while in the three path midway around the turn, kicked away while shifting to the rail turning into
the lane, and was driven out. KNOX raced off the pace in the six path, was driven in the five path around the turn and into the stretch, got bumped by an
inner foe nearing the final sixteenth, but kept on for place. BELTS 'N BROOKS chased in the five path, ranged up in the four path around the turn, was
driven into the stretch, drifted out and bumped an outer foe nearing the sixteenth, and evened out for show. REBELDE trailed in the four path, floated out to
the six path around the turn, and made no impact. CROSS HASTE rated in the three path, was coaxed in the two path midway around the turn, but faded
into the stretch. FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP tracked inside, got shuffled back behind the struggling pacesetter early around the turn, and did not threaten. SONG
RUNNER set the pace in the two path but gaveway rounding the turn.

BEDROCK BIRDIE set the pace along the rail and dug in gamely to just last. GREAT VENEZUELA hopped at the start, advanced inside around the turn,
tipped two wide near the quarter pole, rallied outside, reached even terms in the final strides and lost the bob. QUICK RECOVERY stalked the pace two
wide, steadied near the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the top two in the lane and gained the show. PLATINUM ROCKER tracked the pace three
wide and faded in the lane. SILJIM broke awkwardly, raced off the pace two wide, swung six wide near the quarter pole and passed tiring rivals. MIGUEL'S
BELLE was crowded at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. SWEET MISS was bumped at the start and had the rider lose the left iron for
nearly a furlong, saved ground and lacked a closing bid. REVOLU had early speed outside and retreated two wide around the turn. AMY THE BUTCHER
failed to menace while racing four wide. GRAND LADY INDY was bumped at the start, was through early and was eased through the stretch.
