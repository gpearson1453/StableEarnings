ELIKA bumped at the start, settled just off the pace, responded with a rapid move to make the lead three wide on the turn, drew clear before the furlong
marker, widened in the four path through upper stretch and lasted under right handed urging. LADY GIULIANA bobbled at the start, was forwardly place
inside, altered course to the seven path in upper stretch and was steadily gaining on the winner late. FLASH OF CHEROKEE bumped at the start, moved
up in the ix path into the stretch then was outfinished. CATCHAFALLNSTAR void of early speed, closed fast in the middle of the racetrack through the final
furlong. MY D'VALENTINE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then faded. JUMP INTO SANITY was no factor. KRISTIN bumped at the start, set the
early pace along the inside, had speed into the stretch then folded.

LOCKDOWN LOVER broke in front, set the early pace under pressure two wide, drew clear on the turn, widened into the stretch and won in hand. EL
BANDIDO stalked the early pace and finished determinedly in the five path. HEART OF AN ANGEL saved ground and went evenly. ANGEL'S
SOUPERSTAR failed to menace. PAPA DEL CIELO pressured the winner early from the inside and stopped in the stretch. EL BURRITO was unruly in the
post parade, fractious in the gate, threw his head when the gate opened, squatted, refused to break and was walked off. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

strong hand ride. FARMHAND sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace to the top of the stretch, dug in gamely along the rail but couldn't
handle the winner. ALTAIR went evenly. MIGHTY FROSTED stumbled unseating his rider at the start and was walked off. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
