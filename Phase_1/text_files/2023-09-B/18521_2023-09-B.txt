JUBA'S HAT TRICK stalked off the rail on the opening turn then challenged at even terms into the backstretch, dueled for the lead two deep approaching
the quarter pole, raced clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. PAYMENGOLD saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole and entered the far turn near the rail, angled to the six path through the turn and came along to take second later yards. LORD OF
CORK took the lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was met at the half mile pole and kept the edge over Juba's Hat Trick from that point, but
succumbed to the pressure approaching the quarter pole, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened in the lane. MARCHED raced in the
four path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and showed little in the lane. MINISTRY OF
MAGIC settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and showed little more. BOSS
E BOOGS rated close off the rail, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole then weakened leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
SCHMEAR rounded the opening turn in the four path, closed to the front passing the three eighths pole, dueled clear midway on the far turn, was steadily
handled to late stretch then taken in hand approaching the wire. ROYAL AIR FORCE stalked off the rail, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and
raced close through the backstretch, but dropped back midway on the far turn and had to settle for second best. GLOBALIZATION was reluctant in the post
parade then rounded the opening turn about the four path, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and dueled
for third. SMOKIN SMITTY rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole but was caught past the pole, flattened at the rail
into the far turn and was outfinished for third. GAMING SOUL rounded the first turn about the five path, left the turn outside and gave chase toward the
seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and showed little more. TAKE AIM saved ground on the first turn and showed little response
through the backstretch. SHAKIN IT BIG TIME raced off the rail on the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch but weakened at the rail on the far turn.
WAVE ACTION was not a factor. PAY THE SQUID saved ground close to the early pace then faded through the backstretch.
