Footnotes
PENS STREET stalked two then three wide, drew alongside the top pair from outside on the backstretch, vied for the lead through the far turn, cleared
leaving the bend, drew off when roused and was ridden out to the wire. BANDEENA broke a hair slow, chased two then three wide around the clubhouse
turn, challenged four deep on the second bend, was no match for the winner in the lane but was clearly second best. A BROKEN BREEZE rated along the
inside for a bit before going up to duel for command into the backstretch, fought into and around the far turn, could not kick on with the winner at the top of
the lane and weakened. THE REIGN SONG broke out then got hustled to the front, crossed over once clear of inner rival, dueled outside A BROKEN
BREEZE into the backstretch, vied between rivals around the far turn, failed to keep up into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
CRIMSON ROSE was closest in pursuit to the outside of the leader into the turn, drew alongside at the three-eighths pole, floated out by BENGAL TIGER
leaving the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and widened through the lane while kept to task. SUGAR SUGAR chased three deep into the turn, came four
wide into the lane, moved out in upper stretch and bested the rest. LASTING LOVE chased along the rail, steered out in upper stretch and was denied
second. TIP TOP GAL broke a step slow and was crowded a bit shortly after, ran up on heels approaching the nine-sixteenths pole, chased between foes
into the turn, ran two wide through the turn and passed tired rivals. KEYCHAIN GIRL stalked the pace from inside, cut the corner into the lane, asked in
upper stretch and failed to respond. BENGAL TIGER away quickly to take control, challenged from outside at the three-eighths pole, drifted into the lane
and weakened once overtaken.

Footnotes
EAGLES LANDING broke well then stalked the leading duo up the backstretch, chased two to three wide on the turn, was closest in pursuit entering the
final furlong, drew alongside HABEAS with a sixteenth remaining and drove past. HABEAS set the pace under pressure from outer rival, put away that foe at
the three-eighths pole, showed the way from off the rail into the drive, led clear into the final furlong, challenged by the winner at the sixteenth pole and
yielded late. BARTON STRONG got crowded a bit early, chased two wide into the turn, went three to four wide into the lane, summoned a mild rally and
was along for the show honors. SOUTH COAST ROUTE bumped leaving the gate, chased two then three wide around the turn, churned on for a minor
award but failed to threaten. KING ZOG tracked the pace from inside and lacked a rally in the drive. CRYPTOHOLIC got bumped on both sides leaving the
gate, climbed early and dropped back, steered out wide, went five then six wide on the turn and improved placings in the lane. REEF CITY settled inside,
coaxed on the inside around the turn, angled out in the stretch and failed to menace. SEA BREEZE BOY broke in and bumped, pressed in hand from
outside, lost touch with the leader at the three-eighths pole, came five wide into the lane, moved inward in upper stretch and weakened. MT. ZEROR sat off
the pace, navigated the turn four wide and was not a factor. I GOT A GUY broke in and bumped, chased near the back off the inside, rounded the bend
three wide and made no impact. NYQUILER got pinballed leaving the gate, chased four wide into the turn, five wide into the lane and faded. REAL
THIRSTY bumped at the start, chased five wide into the turn, dropped back around the bend and had little left for the stretch run.

HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN chased along the inside into the first turn then angled out to the three path around the bend, coaxed along two then three wide on
the far turn, steered out into the stretch, moved outside the drifting leader with a furlong left to run and edged away. SHE'S A BIT SASSY sped to the front in
the two path, showed the way under pressure to the second bend, was overtaken past the seven-sixteenths pole, chased the new leader into the lane, came
back on in the furlong grounds and gained the place. SIGNORA MINISTER chased four wide around the first turn, went up to press from outside on the
backstretch, took over early on the far turn then cleared at the three-eighths pole, drifted out to the five path on that bend, drifted out further in the lane while
maintaining a short lead into the final furlong and yielded in deep stretch. INDY'S STAR chased five then four wide around the clubhouse turn, went three
wide into the second bend, spun five wide into the drive and weakened. WHISTLER'S STYLE broke a bit slow and lost his path at the start, trailed three
wide early on, four wide into the far turn, six wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TRUSTY RUSTY stalked the top pair from outside, bid three deep on the turn, took over in upper stretch, maintained a short advantage over PAPA TIGER
through the final furlong and gamely prevailed. PAPA TIGER dueled for command outside a rival, inched ahead from inner foe around the bend but had to
contend with TRUSTY RUSTY challenging also from outside, lost command in upper stretch, fought back from inside through the final furlong and proved a
game second. ALL THE KING'S MEN dueled for the lead from inside, lost touch with the top pair late on the turn, moved out in the lane continuing to give
chase within striking distance, angled outside the leaders with a sixteenth to go and came back on for a game third. NEW YORK DREAMS (GB) sat off the
pace, went two to three wide around the bend, steered inward in the drive and finished with a mild rally. GOLF DRAMA became antsy in the gate and had
his head turned as the gates opened then got bumped, raced near the back three wide into the turn, angled out and came six wide into the stretch and
finished with a mild rally. CATHEDRAL LIGHT stalked from inside, moved out in the stretch and finished evenly. IMPERIAL HORNET broke in and bumped
rival, sat off the pace four to five wide on the turn and weakened. MENTIROSA traveled near the back well off the rail, went five wide into the turn, seven
wide into the stretch and failed to menace. WARRENS WORLD chased in the two path leaving the backstretch, entered the stretch four wide and
weakened.

Footnotes
GYPSY TEARS stalked the leaders to the turn, bid three deep around the bend, kicked clear and drew away midstretch, ridden along to the sixteenth pole
then held safely in hand late. RIFEY was off a bit slow from outside, trailed up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, steered out in the lane, came
with a late run but was too late. SAULS CALL dueled outside a rival, fought two wide through the turn, lost command into the stretch, could not go on with
the winner in upper stretch and angled out, then weakened to third. SO I'M TOLD dueled inside SAULS CALL, lost touch with outer pair leaving the bend
and weakened in the lane. NOLONGERAHOBBY sat off the pace, went four then five wide around the bend and failed to menace. RACHEL'S COACH
stumbled badly, chased three wide into the turn, moved out and exited the bend five wide and weakened.

Footnotes
YUKI (CHI) sped clear and moved into the two path, showed the way up the backstretch, drifted out late on the far turn, continued to drift out through the
stretch, remained clear into the final sixteenth and held well over the late charge from the runner-up. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH tossed her head at the start,
settled at the back, trailed three wide into the far turn, moved in a bit then swung out late on the bend, steered out wider in upper stretch, came with a late
rush but was not enough. TROUVILLE tracked in the two path, came three wide into the stretch, split foes at the three-sixteenths pole, finished willingly in
deep stretch but lost the place. GANADORA stumbled in the beginning, chased three deep around the clubhouse turn, was closest in pursuit into the far
turn, entered the lane five wide, churned on through the lane and missed the show honors. ANGEL NADESHIKO stalked along the inside, asked two wide
leaving the far turn and lacked a bid in the furlong grounds. GILA rated between rivals early, chased in the two path leaving the backstretch, exited the far
turn four wide, moved out and flattened in the late stages. CHISMOSA broke out slightly, pulled three to four wide early, was a bit rank early on the
backstretch, raced within striking distance four wide into the second bend, spun six wide into the stretch and weakened.
