Footnotes
BIG TIME FLIRT had the lead briefly soon after the start, chased the pace into the stretch, came on again between horses under left handed urging,
brushed, dug in gamely and proved best by the narrowest of margins. PRESSLEY RIDGE raced widest down the backstretch, shifted in entering the turn,
closed ground four then three wide into the stretch under left then right handed urging, brushed through the final stages and just missed. ORVILLE B broke
slowly, rushed to the lead along the rail before a quarter, set the pace with a clear advantage until deep stretch then was outfinished. NIKAO moved up
three wide into the turn, dropped inside then came up empty. MY BUDDY MICAH was no factor. MY TICKET hopped at the start and was outrun.
SOMETHING ON TAP was no threat. WHY KENNY WHY had brief speed. FORMYBOYS was through early.

HAPPYBDAYMRPREZ away alertly, set all the pace while getting slow fractions and drew off under left handed urging. THELMA LUCILLE chased the
winner and finished second best. MY TWO JAKES bore in at the start bumping CANELA FINA into SNAZZY, was allowed to settle then had a mild late rally
in the four path. CANELA FINA was bumped and forced into SNAZZY at the start, had good early speed along the rail, checked behind the winner past the
eleven sixteenths pole, stalked the pace into the stretch then weakened. POLLY PRISSY PANTS failed to respond. SNAZZY was bumped at the start,
checked along the rail leaving the clubhouse turn and trailed throughout.

handed urging to win going away. MITESSE away alertly, set the pace along the inside for a half then was no match for winner despite strong urging. INDY
PRINCESS KOKO unhurried early, had a mild rally late in the middle of the racetrack. DESIGNATE bobbled at the start, moved up along the inside on the
turn then failed to sustain that bid. PROUD MAID MARIAN stalked the early pace three wide and failed to respond. FLAXEN trailed.
