Footnotes
SPIRITED RIDE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, kicked clear in
upper stretch and held that margin to the wire. SHEZA NASTY GIRL raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, navigated the bend from the three
path, launched a bid passing the three sixteenths path and gained ground late. BOLD BABY chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of
a mile, continued around the turn in the two path and kept on in the stretch. SOFSTER tracked the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, raced in
the two path around the turn and showed no kick. BELLA CARMELINA trailed the field up the backstretch, swung out to the three and four path coming
around the turn and made no bid. DON'T TELL KELLY led the field between horses through the early going, continued to show the way while saving ground
around the turn and tired in the lane.

SHE SO COOL saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground
around the far turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and pulled clear. HARPER'S DO saved ground early, led the field up the backstretch, continued to
show the way while racing in the two path around the far bend and was caught late. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS raced off the pace between horses through
the opening half mile, began a bid from the three path headed into the second turn and improved position in the lane. OJITOS BELLOS raced in the two
path around the first bend, chased the leader up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. PURRFECT
DANI raced in the middle of the pack on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the second turn still in the three path and
faded from there. MY JO JO raced in the three path early, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began to move up while racing
in the three path around the far turn, swung wide entering the stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. LA SANTA CLARA saved ground at the back of
the pack throughout and was never a factor.
