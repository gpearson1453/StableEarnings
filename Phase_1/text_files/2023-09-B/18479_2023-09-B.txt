Footnotes
ALLEN'S ROCKET settled along the inside just off the top pair around the first turn, continued to stalk rivals up the backstretch, made a move nearing the
far turn, cleared the lead three furlongs from home, cut the corner entering the lane and pulled away. JOHN R was reserved racing in the back, picked up
the pace late on the far turn, swung wide into upper stretch, gathered momentum under steady encouragement and finished clearly second best. JUST
JOHNNY led the way around the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch, got collared by eventual winner nearing the far turn, came three wide into
upper stretch and ran on for a share. TEMPLE CITY RUN rated off the top trio in the early going, chased four wide in range around the far turn then failed to
respond through the lane. ESPE'S GUY raced three to four paths wide heading into the first turn, was forwardly placed racing just off the leader up the
backstretch, chased three wide around the turn, came out wider into upper stretch and retreated.

CAN'T MAKE ME quickly cleared the lead and angled inside soon after the start, set the uncontested pace up the backstretch and remained clear still
unleashed around the turn, cut the corner turning for home and drew off under a brisk hand ride. LAZY N LUCKY was unhurried and raced in the back,
swung five wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and cleared second best. UNGLUED rated off the top trio in early stages, made a move with three
furlongs left to run, chased three wide around the turn, drifted wider turning for home, ran on and cleared show. KAMEA tracked the pace two wide up the
backstretch, launched a bid heading into the turn, stayed on two wide to the furlong marker then gave way. SKYLAR'S FIRE drifted inward at the start then
advanced up the inside and tracked the clear leader, given cue on the inside around the turn, ran on to the eighth pole then came up empty.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN DON set the pace up the backstretch and held clear around the turn, saved ground entering upper stretch, widened advantage and kept to task
under steady encouragement. RICKEY B raced off the pace in opening stages then steadily advanced and circled up four wide at the quarter pole, came
five wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and finished second best. WAR RON was well reserved and raced in the back, saved ground into upper
stretch then shifted out, rallied willingly and got up for show. CHICAGO CHROME was forwardly paced along the rail and steadied entering the turn, was
ridden on the inside then tipped two wide entering upper stretch and kept on for a minor share. DISCREET INVASION raced off the early pace, saved
ground around the turn, angled out upper stretch and finished willingly but was too late for impact. ROCK CITY ROCKET hustled along in steady pursuit, cut
the corner turning for home, gained closer contention a furlong out then flattened late. LANGUAGE BARRIER raced near midpack, hustled along three to
four wide around the turn and lacked the late needed response for impact. NASTY EXAGGERATOR raced in range in early stages then gave way mid-way
around the turn. TAKE ME UP BRADY was forwardly placed through early stages, sustained bid around the turn then tired in the drive.

MONTEREY PENINSULA was allowed to settle out of the gate and continued reserved into the turn, swung four to five wide into the upper stretch and
headed in pursuit, surged gamely to the wire and got up in time. BIG BOSS BEN tracked the top pair then picked up the pace three wide late on the turn,
steadily edged up closer, dueled gamely with MYSTERY MAN in the final stages then got denied by late surging winner in final stride while finishing on
equal terms for place. MYSTERY MAN vied for the lead heading into the turn and fought back to the furlong marker, briefly shook free then took on the
challenge of BIG BOSS BEN deep stretch, fought back gamely then got denied by late gainer and finished on equal terms for place. HUNKA BURNING
LOVE rated off the top trio in early stages, hustled along two wide into upper stretch, showed interest but needed more for impact. FRANKLY EPIC vied for
the early lead with MYSTERY MAN, battled on around the turn, fought back past the furlong marker then gave way.

HUSKER BUTCH raced off the top flight in the opening quarter then picked up the pace two wide heading into the turn, stayed on determinedly in pursuit of
the leader through the lane, matched strides with WHISTLER at the sixteenth pole, dug in under firm handling and edged away. WHISTLER held a slight
edge in opening stages and angled closer to the inside which put inside duo CONSTITUTION DAY and JPS HARLEY in tight, forcing them both to check
sharply and lose all momentum, led the way into the turn, continued on top into the final furlong then outfinished late. IRISH DAWN tracked the pace up the
backstretch, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, ran on into the lane and edged rival for show. LEA ME BE rated just off the leaders in early
stages, hustled along four wide around the turn, got carried out wider turning for home, ran on and got edged for show. CONSTITUTION DAY raced up
close in contention for the early lead, got put in tight when WHISTLER angled in going up the backstretch, checked sharply from the half mile marker to the
three eighths pole, lost all momentum and steadily retreated. J PS HARLEY GLIDER raced up close just off the early lead, got in tight along the rail when
WHISTLER angled in up the backstretch, checked sharply while losing all action, was pulled up and eased across the wire, walked off. THE STEWARDS
POSTED AN INQUIRY LOOKING INTO THE RUN THROUGH THE BACKSTRETCH, AFTER REVIEW WHISTLER WAS FOUND GUILTY OF ANGLING
IN CAUSING BOTH JPS HARLEY AND CONSTITUTION DAY TO CHECK SHARPLY, WHISTLER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED

Footnotes
NINETEEN HUNDRED set the early pace, continued to hold firm around the turn, turned back the bid from DARK BARON and finished clear. DARK
BARON stalked the leader into the turn, launched a two wide bid at the head of the lane and cleared second best. DEER RUN raced off the clear top trio in
early stages, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and secured a share. LETS ROCK N STROLL raced near midpack, saved ground around the turn,
roused along the inside at the head of the lane and needed more for late impact. QUARTERNIGHT raced off the pace, swung wide into the lane and passed
tiring foes. LAST SENTENCE raced off the early speed, came two wide into the lane and lacked a rally. SPIRITED DREAM failed to move into contention.
BABYS TIME TO SING raced near mid-range up the backstretch and around the turn then faded. MR SNERDLY chased through early stages then steadily
retreated.
