Footnotes
FOXY ELAINE pressed the pace from the gate to the top of the lane and edged away in a determined drive down the lane. MORNING GORDITA stalked
the pace from the fence through the turn, angled out three wide in upper stretch and surged for the place in the final stride. RUNTOLIVE set a pressured
pace, kept on while dueling through the lane and was out-finished in deep stretch. ANGEL ON FIRE bumped at the start to drop to the rear of the field, cut
the corner coming home and showed good late interest. C C GRAND tracked the leaders from two wide into the turn, faded back around the bend and
finished evenly.

BRIGADIER GENERAL prompted the pace from two wide for the first half mile, assumed command into the turn, opened a clear advantage turning for
home and finished well having never been threatened in the lane. PHANTOM RIDE stalked the pace from the fence saving ground into the far turn, angled
out at the head of the lane and finished willingly a clear second best. ETHEREAL ROAD broke well out leaving the gate, raced up three wide to be well
placed down the backstretch, ranged up into the final bend and finished evenly lacking a closing rally when called upon. C F V BULLET trailed for the first
half, circled three wide with an early rally into the far turn and flattened out. PRINCE SHIM broke well to take the lead along the fence for the first half mile
and steadily faded coming home.

Footnotes
COWBOY CHURCH tracked the leaders from two wide into the turn, angled out to the four path to rally up to engage the leaders mid-stretch and edged
away nearing the wire. GIRVIN CITY LIMITS dueled from the rail on the lead into the turn, briefly surrendered the lead, battled back to duel all the way to
the wire in a game effort but was passed late in the drive. TREE OF LIBERTY pressed the pace to the turn, briefly took the lead nearing the quarter pole,
battled on through the lane while between horses and weakened in the final fifty yards in a good effort. JUSTHAPPYTOBEHERE slow early to be well
behind and rallied turning for home closing well. AMATEUR DAY went one-paced, failing to mount a rally. OUT WORK'M unhurried for the first three-eighths
and made a mild bid down the lane splitting rivals in deep stretch. WHISKEY JUSTICE well placed to be prominent along the rail through the turn and faded
coming home. BLACK WHITE N GOLD was never a threat.

Footnotes
DEEP STRIKE prompted the pace for the first half mile, rallied in the turn to take command at the head of the lane and drew off convincingly. PURPLE
AURA tracked the leaders down the backside from three wide, made a bid midway on the turn under an early drive and finished well down the lane
maintaining his rally. MIDNIGHT TIL DAWN stalked the pace to the head of the lane while having worked to the rail saving ground and finished willingly up
the fence. YELLOW JACKET well placed in mid-pack down the backside, was bumped by PLAY THE TRUMPET and hemmed in entering the far turn while
looking for racing room, waited from between horses to the upper stretch and rallied down the lane through traffic in a rough trip. BACHMAN unhurried early
on to be near the rear for the first half mile and made a mild bid in the stretch to be gaining ground. PLAY THE TRUMPET in tight early down the lane the
first time while racing up the rail, worked his way out down the backside, exchanged bumps in the far turn, rallied five wide and finished evenly. TORMENTA
JERRY set a pressured pace for the three quarters of a mile and weakened in the stretch. HADLEY'S MAX attempted to get out on the first turn racing wide,
settled through the turn and went one-paced failing to menace. FIREBALL JUSTICE was never a threat. BUDGET BOOSTER was outrun.

Footnotes
CASTLE MAGIC pressed the pace from two wide to the turn, was set to a drive from between rivals approaching the quarter pole, dueled with the
pacesetter to mid-stretch, shook clear at the sixteenth pole and held the closer safe at the wire in a game effort. MIZZTIFY DOLL tracked the pace into the
turn, made a steady advance from midway on the bend to the finish line to gain the show and be cutting into the winner's lead in deep stretch. CHIMES set
a pressured pace dueling to mid-stretch with the winner and was out-finished inside the sixteenth pole. SHARON'S GREY HOPE rated in hand into the turn,
rallied four wide and made late gains in the stretch. CRICKENBERGER stalked the leaders to the turn, ranged up three wide to challenge turning for home
and flattened out down the lane. HONEY RED broke inward to the gap leaving the gate to trail the field and passed weaker rivals in the stretch. ALLIE
MAES REVENGE chased the early pace and faded. COMPRESSED ENERGY was never a threat and dropped back through the lane.

Footnotes
CODE OMAHA broke sharp to open a clear advantage shortly away from the gate, was challenged in mid-stretch, responded and drew away to the wire in a
convincing manner. SILENT HEART squeezed back at the start to trail, steadily gained ground through the turn and closed well belatedly for the place.
AZTECA'S GOLD tracked the leaders down the backside, rallied in the turn to loom boldly in upper stretch and was out-kicked down the lane. WEEKEND
CONCERTO prompted the pace from five wide in the turn to be prominent at the head of the lane and failed to sustain his rally. ELM STREET tracked the
pace from the rail in a five horse pack in the turn, checked sharply when a rival impeded several on the turn, lost position and came on again well down the
lane. HABERDASHERY stalked the pace in the turn from between rivals three wide, dropped to the inside causing the inside two rivals to take up on the
turn, was well placed turning for home and flattened out in the drive. DADDY'S DINERO raced between rivals prominently into the turn, was forced to take
up when impeded by HABERDASHERY on the bend and bumped the inside rival crowding him against the rail, was taken in hand, settled and finished
evenly. GOOD POINT raced four wide in the turn to be well placed, was checked late in the turn and dropped back failing to re-rally. IZZIT MIDNIGHT was
never a threat.

Footnotes
WRITE OFF JERRY hustled up from the outside to be two wide to press the pace in the first turn, assumed command down the backstretch, opened a clear
advantage in the turn and held well through the lane in a well managed ride. CHANNEL Z unhurried to the far turn, commenced a rally turning for home
angling five wide at the head of the lane and closed well to be gaining at the wire. SMART PRIZE tracked the leader to the far turn, mounted a three wide
threatening bid to the quarter pole and could not sustain his rally down the stretch. FIGHT'N READY well placed two wide in the third pair down the
backside, rallied into the turn and failed to close the gap. SIX MISSIONS saved ground the entire trip along the rail and made a mild late bid. POLYGLOT
sped to the lead down the lane the first time, kept with the pace to the top of the lane and gradually gave way through the stretch. ASCRIBE reserved off the
pace through the final bend and showed some late energy while racing wide down the lane. SHOCKWAVE saved ground along the rail while well positioned
through the far turn and faded. QUICK IMPULSE was never a threat. MISTER MOSCATO rank along the rail early and trailed the entire way as a
non-factor.

Footnotes
LIGHT UP MY LIFE set the pace while dueling through the turn, briefly lost the lead, re-engaged the pace presser turning for home and kicked away from
that one in the lane. NO JOKING MATTER pressed the pace through the turn, briefly took a lead nearing the quarter pole, dueled to midway down the lane
and could not match the winner. GOLDEN HEIST reserved off the pace to be mid-pack through the turn and made a steady gain down the stretch to gain
the show. MALI BALI unhurried for the first half mile, angled out six wide at the top of the lane and made a mild late bid. PADDI'S WISH slow early to be at
the pack of the pack and passed weaker in the lane. CABIN ABBY chased the leaders for a half mile and tired. MY BOYS failed to menace. YOU'RE SO
AWESOME tracked the pace from the rail, was set to an early drive and came up empty.
