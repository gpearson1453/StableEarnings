Footnotes
FIRST KITTEN speed to duel between horses to the turn, roused to go clear in the final sixteenth under stout handling to the wire. JOLIE RULER no speed
while outside with late run in stretch while coming on late best of the rest. ERV'S WENCH showed no speed to the stretch on the wrong lead, split horses
into the lane, changed leads late with a burst to the wire for the show dough. MY TOMMY LEE unhurried early while saving ground, kept on to improve late.
KNOT WILD could not keep up with no response in the stretch run. SUPORB tried hard from outside to the stretch, could not keep up faded. FUTURE FLAY
shuffled back to the turn never factored. SIS BOOM BOB squeezed out of the gate, rushed, showed speed to the front dueled to the half with nothing left.
MERRY OF SOUL chased top trio to the turn with nothing left and faltered back.
