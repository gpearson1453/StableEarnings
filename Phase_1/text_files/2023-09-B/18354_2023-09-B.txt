Footnotes
PRIDE OF PAYTON , four deep the first turn, prompted the pace outside IMPETUD down the backstretch and around the far turn, gained the lead turning
for home and prevailed in an extended drive. IMPETUD set a pressured pace near the inner rail, was hooked turning for home and faded in the drive. LAW
OF THE JUNGLE came in at the break, saved ground around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, worked between horses while on his left lead and
rallied. ADMIT NOTHING raced in mid pack down the backstretch and on the far turn, swung five deep in upper stretch, raced outside horses and passed
tired ones. ALOTTACENTS , wide around both turns, failed to rally. SIR LUMPALOT , along the inner rail on both turns, eased out entering the stretch,
chased the pace and weakened. FOOD FOODIE raced along the inner rail throughout, weakened in the drive and was eased late. VOTETHEMALLOUT ,
pinched back leaving the starting gate, was no factor. RUSHIN TOTHECIRCLE , wide both turns, was outrun.

Footnotes
SHINE ON MOON was sent up between foes early on to contest the pace, emerged in a battle outside BELTANE leaving the far turn, carried that duel into
and through the lane, kept on under left handed asks inside the sixteenth marker and got up in the final jumps. BELTANE advanced inside rivals to put a
head in front nearing the turn, set a pressured pace while under some rating around the turn, maintained a slim advantage past the furlong grounds, kept on
valiantly but was out nodded in the final yards. OUR LEGAL TENDER broke slowly, regrouped and raced off the pace while three deep leaving the far turn,
edged up past the five sixteenths then steadied off heels nearing the lane, shifted out to be four to five wide in upper stretch and closed strongly. ORANGE
JUICE had speed between foes then eased back off rivals in the opening furlong, appeared to take an awkward stride past the half, came out and gained
between runners near the quarter pole, angled out a bit and closed steadily. KINDA FONDA WANDA drafted back early, was under coaxing off the rail mid
turn, swung out seven to eight wide in upper stretch, straightened and finished well. PUMP IT UP dropped back off the early pace, was under asking three
wide in upper stretch but lacked a solid run. IN THE END had speed four wide outside foes, vied three deep nearing the turn, chased the top pair past the
five sixteenths, drifted out a bit and weakened. DESTIN'S RAINBOW bore in at the break and bumped with a foe, sent up soon after the steadied, chased
around the turn then gave way. K'S STORM READY , bumped and pinched back at the break, saved ground into the lane, checked when in close near mid
stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
IRISH MAXIMA sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and readily pulled away through the stretch under a brisk hand ride. SHEILAHS
WARCLOUD saved ground around the turn, swung outside in upper stretch and had a sllight rally. BEACHFRONT BREEZE , in the two path chasing the
winner around the turn, remained on her left lead and weakened. BOOTSY'S MERLOT , outrun, was well off the inner rail on the turn and lugged in near the
eighth pole. EMM ESS EH chased the pace racing in the three path around the turn and faltered in upper stretch. VELVET VIXEN , wide on the turn, was
not a factor. FOXY CURL broke slowly and trailed.

FUTURE IS NOW quickly went clear then dropped in to secure the rail, set the pace under a light hold while being shadowed by a rival, responded to firm
asking and opened up leaving the three sixteenths, kept on under solid encouragement past the sixteenth marker then was taken in hand for the final yards.
MISS SAKAMOTO chased to the inside of a rival, angled three to four wide entering the lane, straightened and continued on willingly to gain the place.
WINKED , brushed at the break, edged up soon after and tracked the winner from her outside, could not quicken with that one in upper stretch, stayed on to
pursue to the sixteenth pole and faded. CUT FROM CLASS broke a bit slowly, was sent up between runners and gained a stalking spot heading to the turn,
saved ground with pursuit past the five sixteenths, angled out leaving mid stretch and continued with effort. BITTY BOSS rated off the pace inside, remained
in hand mid turn, swung out for the drive, altered back in advancing past the sixteenth pole and gained. BETCHA BY GOLLY was checked between runners
soon after the break, dropped back, swung seven to eight wide in upper stretch and finished with interest. TRITONE GAL was shuffled back into the turn,
angled out and lacked a serious run. GIFT OF GAB saved ground mid turn and came up empty. LILLY SIMONE , off the pace while saving ground, came
out for the drive but failed to rally. ALLA BREVE , brushed at the break, altered outside BETCHA BY GOLLY when that one checked, raced two to three
wide around the turn and failed to menace. KILLY START , four wide with early pursuit, failed to kick on in upper stretch and faded. BRZINA dropped in for
the run around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
INTREPID DAYDREAM , a forward factor in the two path around the turn, chased the pace, secured command in upper stretch, drifted in near the eighth
pole, was under brisk urging and lasted. DECO STRONG raced in the two path around the turn, worked between horses in upper stretch, moved to the
inner rail near the sixteenth pole and rallied. MOODY WOMAN lacked speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. BENEATH
THE STARS set the pace along the inner rail, was no match for the winner in the stretch, angled out near the eighth pole and gave way. MAMA G'S WISH
lacked speed off the rail down the backstretch, swung four wide leaving the turn and lacked the necessary rally. SWEET GRACIE saved ground on the turn,
chased the pace, angled out turning for home and gave way. BOURBON WILDCAT gave way. FIRST TO ACT broke slowly, trailed and was eased late.

Footnotes
WITTY steadied when in a bit tight at the break, regrouped and rated four wide off the dueling leaders, commenced a run leaving the three sixteenths,
circled five wide advancing in the lane, bumped with an inner rival leaving the three sixteenths, straightened and sustained under solid asks, moved to near
even terms outside SKY'S NOT FALLING leaving the sixteenth pole, dueled, gained a slim advantage late and held firm. SKY'S NOT FALLING came off the
inside and edged up between foes leaving the far turn, took closer order nearing the lane, eased out then was jostled between runners leaving the three
sixteenths, regrouped to bid between foes approaching the sixteenth marker, dueled gamely inside the winner from there and just missed. MATTA dueled
outside COMMANDING GENERAL while under some rating, poked a head in front nearing the lane, clung to a slim advantage past the furlong grounds,
failed to contain outside threats leaving the sixteenth marker and gave way grudgingly. B DETERMINED , inside early while off the pace, came off the rail
mid turn, shifted further out in the drive and found his best too late. PRINCE PERE showed speed between foes, tracked to the inside of a rival mid turn,
bumped with an outer rival when attempting to work out for room leaving the three sixteenths, lacked some room near the sixteenth pole, shifted out and
churned on. R B'S THE BOSS had speed inside, eased back off the leaders nearing the turn, remained inside for the drive but failed to generate the needed
run. COMMANDING GENERAL was hard sent between foes and gained the early lead, dropped in and sparred with MATTA, stayed on well to about the
sixteenth marker then weakened. SHOWTIME CAT , three deep stalking the early pace, shifted four wide while getting closer into the stretch, bumped and
steadied between rivals departing the three sixteenths and weakened. BOSS MAN J J bobbled inward at the break and was off slowly, lost ground
throughout and failed to make a serious recovery. GOLDEN G , fractious in the gate, steadied between rivals nearing the turn, dropped back and came up
empty.

DOLLARIZATION , close up leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was caught behind horses entering the stretch, angled to the three path in
upper stretch, swept to command in mid stretch and drew out under brisk urging. SIR ALFRED JAMES trailed to the stretch, swung to the five path in upper
stretch and rallied mildly. STAGE LEFT , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, was floated to the four path by the winner in upper stretch and
weakened. WONDRWHERECRAIGIS prompted the pace outside JAXON TRAVELER, bid for the lead in upper stretch and gave way the final furlong.
JAXON TRAVELER set a pressured pace along the inner rail and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
FULL COUNT FELICIA drifted out slightly at the break, straightened and took command, set a rated pace just off the inside while handling some outside
pressure, edged away some soon into the backstretch and dictated, eagerly widened leaving the three eighths, was put to stout asking leaving the three
sixteenths and opened up a commanding lead, remained under strong encouragement past the sixteenth pole then was geared down late. WILLAKIA was
lightly steadied at the break, stalked while saving ground, eased out and moved up between runners nearing the quarter pole, gave futile chase from there
and held down the place. CREATIVE CAIRO , in range three wide, circled four wide with pursuit into the stretch but lacked a final punch. EIGHT DANZAS ,
off the pace and off the inside, made a mild run between rivals in mid stretch then flattened out. EIDIKOS (GB) drifted in at the break, steadied back from
between runners heading to the first turn, saved ground through the backstretch run, failed to kick on past the three eighths then angled out to no avail in
upper stretch. MILAGROSA SURENA (ARG) broke a step slow, was quite keen when engaging the winner from her outside nearing the wire the first time,
settled better past the five eighths, shifted in to pursue, stayed in touch to upper stretch then gave way. MY THOUGHTS was rated back from between foes
early, dropped well off the pace, came six wide for the drive and failed to respond.

APPLE PICKER , well off the disputed pace down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, swung to the four path entering the stretch, swept to command
in mid stretch, was under energetic urging and drew away. TAPPIN JOSIE lacked speed, raced off the rail on the turn, swung to the five path in upper
stretch and rallied mildly. LATE FROST , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and weakened late. OUR LIBERTY
BELLE , not an early factor, raced along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the four path straightening out for the drive and passed tired rivals. TALK TO
THE JUDGE hugged the inner rail while disputing the pace and gradually weakened through the stretch. MS. BUCCHERO disputed the pace between
horses and gave way in upper stretch. BLIND SPOT lacked speed, circled the turn three wide, dropped back and was eased.

Footnotes
HIGHESTDISTINCTION , unhurried early, angled out to race three to four wide through the backstretch run, gathered momentum leaving the three eighths,
ranged up under pressure into to lane, drifted in slightly under right handed urging and bumped with KING VEGA (GB) near the three sixteenths,
straightened away and wrested command leaving mid stretch then eagerly widened through the final sixteenth while kept to task. KING VEGA (GB) cleared
nearing the wire the first time, dropped in and set a rated pace in about the two path, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and soundly bumped with the winner,
dueled inside that one leaving mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. SMOKIN' T , three wide stalking the pace, was pushed along past the five sixteenths,
failed to go on entering the lane and faded. HE'SPUREGOLD stalked the pace while saving ground, was under coaxing into the far turn, shifted out four
wide while pursuing into the stretch but failed to kick on.

Footnotes
GILDA'S GIRL , patiently rated inside horses down the backstretch, began to advance leaving the turn, bumped with GATHER THE FACTS when going to
the three path entering the stretch, swept to command in upper stretch and held sway under steady handling. OPINIONATED , unhurried down the
backstretch, worked between horses through the stretch and rallied. STAGE CALL , steadied in close quarters leaving the starting gate, swung to the six
path in upper stretch and rallied nicely. MILLROSE hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace and weakened the final furlong. TRES MARIA'S DREAM lacked
speed, raced near the inner rail to mid stretch, steadied lacking room near the eighth pole and had insufficient time to recover. LEM ME DRINK raced in mid
pack down the backstretch, was four deep on the far turn, got bumped by GATHER THE FACTS when that one came out after bumping with the winner at
the head of the lane then flattened out. GATHER THE FACTS , a forward factor along the inner rail down the backstretch, eased out entering the far turn,
bumped with the winner turning for home and weakened. KELLY'S PARTY GIRL was not a factor. SPOILS OF WAR , three wide both turns, gave way. NO
SHARING , four wide the far turn, was not a factor. FORGOTTEN GIFT disputed the pace two wide and gave way. TWO SPOT chased the pace down the
backstretch and faltered.
