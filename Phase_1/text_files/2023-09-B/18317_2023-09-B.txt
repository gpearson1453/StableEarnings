Footnotes
QUIET MADDELENA broke sharp for lead at the start, was patiently reined back shifting outside down the back straight, began to reel in the early speed
midway on the turn, took control between foes in the two path straightening out for the drive and determinedly held through the stretch for the win. SOCIAL
DRINKER was allowed to settle outside trailing in the beginning, began picking up runners three wide circling horses at the three furlong pole, loomed the
only threat turning for home but could not get by a game winner down the stretch. WAKE UP MAGGIE was in the second flight on the rail tracking the front
duo, shuffled back at the half losing some positioning into the turn, rallied four wide, ran four wide outside horses on the turn keeping pace and shifted
widest to the five path for for the drive showing determination and was gaining steadily in the late stages to be involved at the wire in the win photo.
GORMLEY GIRL watched the front two outside in the tracking second flight, took closer order into the turn, was roused with five sixteenths to go with
runners on each side but was losing ground and position, rebid showing late interest at the sixteenth pole and got up passing tired runners nearing the wire
for a minor share. CEDAR VALLEY broke in and was a step slow to begin, trailed the field at the half mile marker inside, improved on the fence gaining
throughout the turn to be in range at the top of the lane behind the leaders but could not find more and stalled late between foes with 70 yards from the
finish. J M R BOLD VISION was coaxed after the start to clear to the lead by the half, opened up of the field inside entering the turn, was clinging to the lead
surrounded outside by runners at the quarter pole and gave way on the fence in deep stretch.

Footnotes
KATCHY NAME took control on the rail into the first turn, dictated terms down the backside under a tight hold, comfortably opened up midway on the far
turn, drew off in mid stretch and cruised home for the late for the win. ABSOLUTE JEWEL stalked in the two path in the beginning, travelled close to the
back outside foes at the half, rallied four wide around horses three furlongs from the wire, extended stride making a sharp move into contention at the
quarter pole and chased the loose on the lead winner down the lane clearly second best in the end. TEXT ME UP tracked on the rail in the early going,
settled near the back of the pack inside at the half, was on hold when the field bunched up with seven sixteenths to go, began to close in running between
rivals midway on the far turn and showed energy to finish up capturing third money late. A GAL FOR T J sat behind the frontrunner into the first turn, had a
good spot on the rail watching the trio contest down the backside, began to inch closer on the fence entering the turn, lost momentum inside with three
eighths to run and regrouped mildly up the rail down the stretch for a minor role in the end. PHIL IN ECHO was brushed outside at the start, trailed into the
first turn, made an early move four deep outside foes at the half, chased in vain the winner throughout the far turn, could not sustain the run and tired in
deep stretch. FORESTERS PRINCESS prompted four wide into the first turn, continued to force the issue three deep down the backstretch, was asked for
more trying to maintain position into the far turn and emptied out between horses in upper stretch. SILENT BUT VIOLENT was brushed slightly inside at the
break, pressed between runners down the backside for the lead, could not quicken with others in the two path in tight between foes with three furlongs to go
and gave way at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
GRADEVOLE was unhurried to trail down the backstretch, began to lengthen stride circling around runners three wide at the three furlong pole, pounced
outside at the quarter pole to be the threat turning for home and stubbornly wore down the leader in the shadow of the wire for the victory. ECHO SEVEN
contested outside for the lead down the back straight, raced greenly outside briefly getting out midpoint on the turn, regrouped between horses to have a
narrow advantage straightening out to the wire and was outfinished by the winner while on the wrong lead through the stretch. FEATHERWEIGHT had a
good spot alone tracking the front duo at the half, was in tight attempting to burst between foes midway on the turn and determinedly chased behind the
leaders down the stretch never giving in and was gaining slowly when crossing the lead. LADY BOO stalked near the rear in this compact field down the
backside, made little headway on rivals throughout the turn, could not get involved down the lane but finished up with intent to not be beaten all that much in
the end. WORKING HOLIDAY pressed on the rail down the backstretch, battled gamely throughout the turn inside maintaining a slim advantage, was
collared outside at the quarter pole by runners and retreated on the fence running down the lane.

Footnotes
I'M A BOURBON GIRL bumped with a rival at the start, raced outside off the pace, was ridden from the three-eighths going four to five wide on the turn,
fanned widest to be ten deep coming into upper stretch, just got up after a long and sustained drive. CHERRY GARDENS broke inwardly bumping a rival
but recovered to track from mid-pack inside, moved out two wide late on the turn, came into upper stretch two to three deep, bid and took a narrow lead a
sixteenth out, just failed to last. HURRICANE GIZMO bumped with a rival at the start, raced mid-pack three to four wide, swung eight deep turning for home
then shifted in, rallied between rivals but was too late. SHAMELESS AFFAIR tracked the pace in behind, made a bid inside taking the lead about the top of
the stretch, led till the sixteenth pole and was outfinished but kept on gamely. TRILLING SONG was bumped and forced in at the start, raced well back at
the rear, saved ground advancing on the turn, lacked room on the rail at the furlong marker, altered out past that point but was too late. MUCHO
MISSTIQUE was fractious in the gate, bumped sideways at the start, moved up on the turn in behind runners shifting out then in then back out against past
the quarter pole till the top of the stretch, found room wider on the course, ran on. I'M PHANTOM got away alertly, settled in to stalk the pace, moved out
from two to four wide coming past the quarter pole, came out seven wide by the top of the stretch, lacked the needed late kick. SMILES FOR DAVID stalked
from outside four to five wide through the turn, floated nine wide into upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. BEYOND REASON bumped a rival at the
start, raced about mid-division in behind and off the inside three to four wide through the turn, came out eight deep turning for home, was blocked in late
stretch. MOET MONET was coaxed to the front and clear, set the pace racing off the rail, gave way in the stretch. SANDY GRACE was bumped into a rival
at the start, raced outside at the back, was never a threat.

COTTON attended the pace from outside going three to four wide on the turn and taking the lead and moving clear past the five-sixteenths, held safe under
steady handling. MALIBU EDGE settled outside runners off the leader, went four to five wide, was no match but secured the place. MACLEAN'S POSSE
tracked in behind settling in hand, moved out at the five-sixteenths and was four wide leaving the turn and in range, got the nod for show. PRICELESS WILL
shifted outside a foe five wide early on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch, missed show honors. READY FOR A FIGHT chased from between
runners toward the back into the turn, dropped back early on that bend, came out six wide for the drive, ran on. BOSTON TEA PARTY pressed the pace
from between runners, weakened. SUGAR RAY broke a step slowly then was rushed inside to the lead, set a pressured pace, gave way.

Footnotes
VEERY hopped mildly at the start, took control to clear to the inside at the half, was unchallenged setting the fractions throughout the turn and drew away
impressively when roused right handed in mid stretch for the comfortable win. HATMAKER HOLIDAY tracked behind the winner down the backside, waited
on the fence keeping a close eye on the pacesetter throughout the turn, angled out three wide posing the only threat at the top of the stretch but the winner
had something in reserve, was repelled at the furlong marker and ran through to the wire easily besting the rest. CEFALO stalked close to the back of the
pack inside rivals down the back straight, began to pick up horses three wide midway on the turn, swung out widest in the five path turning for home and
closed in willingly on others to be a distant third at the wire. AMERICAN GAMBLE travelled in midpack on the outside in the early stages, was urged three
wide with three eighths remaining to take closer being in the mix four wide at the top of the lane and could not find more evening out in the final furlong
holding for a small share in the end. ANTIGONE broke with the field but was void of early speed trailing, shifted outside to catch up to the pack by the half,
could not make any progress on the turn and finished up on the rail passing tired runners down the stretch. HARD TO CAPTURE prompted the frontrunning
winner three deep down the backstretch, continued to chase into the turn, was roused trying to maintain position with quickening rivals on each side at the
quarter pole, offered little response and weakened inside in the final furlong. BILLYJANE settled in midfield on the inside down the backstretch, was hard
ridden with five sixteenths to go on the rail making no impression on the turn and had little to show on the fence down the stretch.

Footnotes
SOUPER RIVER settled in last rating kindly outside down the back straight, moved easily around runners four wide commencing at the three eighths pole,
swung outside in the five path making a bid for the lead and cruised home late going away from horses in the final furlong. BOXER BRIEF prompted three
deep down the backside, made an early move to pressure the loose leader three furlongs from the finish, poked his head in front momentarily between foes
straightening out for the drive but could not find more to hold off the winner in deep stretch. MIGHT BEE SPEEDY was nudged on chasing the frontrunner at
the half trying to maintain position, could not match strides with the outside rallying foe at the three eights marker, gamely fought on the inside throughout
the turn and determinedly battled to the wire closing late for third in a gutsy effort never giving in. STYLISH GENT took this field down the backstretch, set
the pace running on the turn, was collared outside at the quarter pole, offered little resistance and faded in mid stretch while still holding for a minor share at
the wire. THREE SONNY SIDEUP settled in the two path with rivals in each side tracking in midfield, could not get involved on the turn seeing the field at
the quarter pole and showed some late interest to pass weary foes down the lane. JUSTIN'S WAY travelled in between runners three deep in the third flight
down the backside, had little run to offer around the bend and could not be a presence in the drive to the finish. GUS'S GAMBLE was on the rail in the third
flight tracking down the backside, could not keep up with others running on the fence through the turn and stopped inside in mid stretch.

Footnotes
RIFLING emerged with a slim lead four furlongs from the finish, was pressured outside setting the pace on the turn, put away the early speed foe at the
quarter pole, braced for the new challenger outside in upper stretch and gamely prevailed on the fence inching away at the wire. TIPSY MOON had a good
position tracking behind the engaging foursome with a half remaining, took up the running four wide with five sixteenths to go, bid for the front in the four
path briefly leading with a quarter to run, battled to the wire bobbing heads with the winner in mid stretch but could not find a little extra late and settled for
second best in the end. MISS BIKINI broke inwards slightly brushing rival on the break, stalked between horses near the back down the backstretch, waited
to move at the quarter pole behind a wall of runners, shifted outside in the seven path for the drive and put in a late rally to close in to capture third. ITS A
BIRDIE was in hand early trailing the field down the backside, still could see the pack co-trailing on the outside at the quarter pole and closed with a rush in
the final furlong just missing out for third money in the end. ONANDONANDON pressed inside for the lead at the half mile marker, could not hold inside
position with three furlongs to go when in tight quarters to be mildly steadied on the fence, recovered by the quarter pole under a hard ride to be in the hunt
for a share at the top of the stretch but faded late losing a couple of placings at the finish. INFINITE PASSION settled in midfield four deep outside of
runners down the back straight, improved running four wide midway on the turn, was in with a chance for a piece of the prize in the six path turning for home
and tapered off late nearing the wire. SMART BIRD forced the issue outside four deep with a half mile to go, pressed outside on the turn, leveled out
between foes straightening out for the drive and gave way in deep stretch. NORTHERN PASSAGE was forwardly placed early on, then became shuffled
back between foes at the half, kept pace running with horses on each side in midpack through the turn and finished up with intent running on willingly to the
wire. GOLDEN TRAIN travelled in the middle of this large field on the rail down the backside, could not find another gear running one paced throughout the
turn and could not get involved driving to the wire. GOLD FORESTER stalked in the third flight three deep outside runners, put in a brief run three wide
around horses at the three furlong marker to be in the mix for a share in the four path straightening for home and weakened in mid stretch with foes on each
side. HEKLA'S AURA was situated on the rail close to the rear in the early stages, was asked three wide with three furlongs from home, made little impact,
angled outside six wide for the drive but could never reach contention. TENPENNY NAIL broke out brushing rival at the start, stalked inside near the back of
the field down the backstretch,, could not get interested on the turn co-trailing on the inside and was not a factor in the stretch drive to the finish. FOREST
MAIDEN travelled in the middle of the pack on the rail in the beginning, saved ground but made no progress throughout the turn and offered little finish on
the fence for the drive. CELTIC REVIVAL was part of the early pace scenario down the backside, could not keep up to others quickening stride at the
quarter pole and backed away in upper stretch.
