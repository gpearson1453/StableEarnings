Footnotes
COWAN came out at the break and made contact with Jungle Beast, raced in the five path the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the seven
sixteenths pole and took aim in the three path nearing the quarter, dug in determinedly leaving the turn and edged out ALPHA CHI RHO through the final
sixteenth. The latter rated close in the three path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and took the lead three wide approaching the quarter,
raced briefly clear midway on the far turn but was met leaving the turn and dueled gamely to mid-stretch before reluctantly ceding. O'CONNER SUNSET
rounded the first turn in the three path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and dug in to hold third.
JUNGLE BEAST was bumped leaving the gate then saved ground on the opening turn, eased out into the backstretch, gave chase approaching the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. LIKEABLE set the early pace inside, was met
approaching the nine sixteenths pole and dueled at mostly even terms from that point, but dropped back past the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the
far turn. ICING rated close two deep on the first turn and moved to even terms past the nine sixteenths pole, but dropped back at the quarter pole and faded
at the rail on the far turn. MARTINKELLY was not a factor.

Footnotes
MOONLIT SHADOW raced with the pace two deep through the front stretch, took the nod leaving the nine sixteenths pole and dueled Full Moon Lover at
mostly even terms from that point, contested the far turn between horses and dug in determinedly to edge out LUCYLOU WHO through the stretch. The
latter stalked from the three path the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, drew to even terms three wide midway on the far
turn and dug in gamely to the finish. CHANGE THE WORLD saved early ground then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the
rail on the far turn, eased outward into the lane and finished well to take third later yards. FULL MOON LOVER raced with the early pace, was met leaving
the nine sixteenths pole and gave close chase from that point, contested even terms at the rail on the far turn but weakened inside the eighth pole. LUCKY
BLONDE raced off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased outward leaving the
turn and showed little further. SENECA ROCKS rounded the opening turn about the four path and showed little response through the backstretch.
JAMESTOWN ROAD saved ground on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.

I'M THE MONEY MAN tapered in and stalked the early pace two deep, took the nod into the backstretch and kept the edge over Bop Zapper from the half
mile pole, cleared that one past the five sixteenths, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, moved clear past the eighth pole and held on well with
steady handling. SUMMONING DENIS raced off the rail on the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths
pole, drew to even terms two deep past the quarter but dropped back leaving the eighth pole and had to settle for second best. O'RIGSBY saved ground
well off the pace on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and finished evenly to take third inside
the sixteenth pole. CIDERHOUSE WAY settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the
far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. SCARE DEM raced in the three path the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase past the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and showed little more. CHASENJOHNATHAN rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase
approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and weakened in the lane. LIEUTENANT BROWN hopped at the break and
raced well back. BOP ZAPPER took the early lead and moved to the inside to show the way, was met approaching the half mile pole and gave chase
through the backstretch but faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
MY BUDDY DUANE checked off the heels of Aldarighttricks midway on the opening turn then altered course and took over two deep at the three eighths
pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to late stretch. JUST CALL ME AL settled off the rail on the opening
turn then gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn but had to settle for second best. GREATANDGOOD rounded
the first turn in the three path, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path then flattened into the lane. LORD
CLANCY saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole and improved in the four path on the far turn, but showed little further.
JUST MURPHY settled two deep on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened in the
stretch. ALDARIGHTTRICKS closed to the lead at the three quarter pole while tapering inward, moved to the rail midway on the opening turn, was met at
the three eighths, dropped back from the five sixteenths pole and gave way at the rail into the far turn.
