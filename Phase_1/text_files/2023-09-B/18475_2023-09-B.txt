MIKE OPERATOR sped to the front in the two path, dueled inside DR. TROUTMAN up the backstretch, inched ahead on the far turn, shook free at the top
of the stretch and remained clear under urging. DIVINE FEMININE traveled along the inside into the first turn then moved into the two path, saved ground at
the back around the far turn, moved to within range of the winner entering the final furlong but finished evenly late. MONGOLIAN KINGDOM settled in the
two path, traveled outside a rival to the far turn, angled out and came four wide into the stretch and was along for the show. WARRENS CANDY MAN
pressed from inside early then chased the top pair up the backstretch, rounded the far turn two then three wide and weakened. DR. TROUTMAN chased
three wide early, went up to duel three deep then outside MIKE OPERATOR on the backstretch, stayed alongside through the far turn while moving further
off the rail, lost touch with the winner four wide into the drive and weakened.

ULTRA POWER bumped leaving the gate, chased briefly then went up to duel from inside, shook free from TAPALO midstretch and drew away. NESSO'S
LASTHARRAH broke inward, went up to duel for command then ceded command, stalked the top pair three wide into the turn, came out and entered the
lane six wide, finished willingly down the lane and bested the others. MIRACLE MARK broke in and bumped rival, was prominent early between rivals then
got put in tight and steadied at the five-eighths pole, went four wide into the turn, moved out to the five path briefly then angled inward and exited the bend
three wide, summoned a mild rally but could not get by NESSO'S LASTHARRAH for second. TAPALO dueled for command from outside, fought five wide
into the stretch and weakened down the lane. POTENTIAL SPAM got brushed at the start, saved ground through the turn off the pace, moved off the fence
in the drive and failed to menace. SIR LOOKING GLASS had to take up between foes early, trailed three wide into the turn, spun four wide into the lane,
eased through the stretch and walked off.

BETTY'S SONG sprinted clear quickly, led two then three wide through the turn, remained under confident handling to the three-sixteenths pole, then was
coaxed along lightly and drew off easily. WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ sat off the pace, ridden along two then three wide on the turn, steered out in the stretch
run, put in a mild rally and gained the place. HOLLYWOOD RUMOR chased off the rail, two wide around the turn, was no match for the winner in the lane
and got outkicked for second. MISS COMMANDER chased three deep into the turn, three to four wide around the bend, drifted out in the lane and
weakened. OCEAN OF LIES chased along the rail, saved ground to the stretch and faded out of contention. HAMMETT trailed five wide around the bend
and was not a factor.

Footnotes
COWBOY MIKE dueled three wide around the first turn, cleared leaving the backstretch, led three wide into the stretch, asked right handed past the eighth
pole and was ridden out to the wire. BUCK OWENS chased four deep on the clubhouse turn, went two wide into the far turn, angled out and came five wide
into the stretch, kept on through the lane and bested the others. WINE AND WHISKY stalked between rivals, got bumped and put in tight, having to check
past the three-quarter pole, chased three wide into the lane, churned on down the stretch and got edged for second. JERRY JEFF WALKER raced up close
four wide, came in to bother rivals past the three-quarter pole, rounded the far turn three then four wide and weakened. GALOPING CAT dueled for
command from inside, chased the winner leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and faded. LUKA GRAZIE stalked along the rail, drifted
out and bumped rival past the three-quarter pole, chased between then two wide on the far turn and weakened. STAR PROSPECT tracked three deep
around the first turn, got bumped, crowded and checked past the three-quarter pole, remained off the rail and spun four wide into the lane and came up
empty. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT BETWEEN SEVERAL RIVALS EARLY ON THE BACKSTRETCH.
FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH LUKA GRAZIE AND JERRY JEFF WALKER BOTHERED WINE AND WHISKY
AND STAR PROSPECT PAST THE THREE-QUARTER POLE, THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION.
