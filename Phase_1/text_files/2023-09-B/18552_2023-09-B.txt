HUMOR SENSE stumbled at the start, stalked the pace three to two wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to gain a short lead by the quarter pole, then
drew clear leaving the turn and remained clear to the wire, mild drive. ONE VIOLENT AFFAIR was bumped at the start, allowed to settle towards the inside,
three wide by the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane and finished willingly to be clearly second best. BEST WORST IDEA tracked the early pace four
wide, made a three wide bid on the turn but flattened out. ADAYINSPAIN set the pace on the inside and was headed on the turn and weakened. DIXIE
LARK was reserved early and failed to respond, dull effort.

BODACIOUS BREN was away alertly to vie for the lead on the inside and in the two path, then made a bid on the turn to gain a short lead, then shook clear
leaving the turn and remained clear to the wire to prove best, driving. FANCY WARRIOR was well placed on the inside, made a bid on the inside bearing
the quarter pole, then was in tight leaving the turn, moved off the inside by the furlong marker and ran on but could not get to the winner, second best. CIVIL
NOTION was allowed to settle early towards the inside, swung out five wide leaving the turn and was along for the show award. CLOUDY BAY was off a
step slow, moved up four wide to stalk the pace, made a three wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the lane. BALI MOON vied for the lead three wide
and weakened.

TOUGH ENOUGH pressed the pace three wide, made a three wide bid in hand on the turn to duel for command by the quarter pole, then kicked away
leaving the turn and was kept to left handed crop in the furlong grounds to prove much the best. ALLIE'S HALO tracked the pace from the inside, eased off
the inside by the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane and finished willingly, second best. I LOVE MARIA was off a step slow, saved ground on the
turn, shifted off the inside leaving the turn and finished well, bested rest. STEPH'S TOP NICK chased the pace, between rivals on the turn, swung out four
wide leaving the turn and had no rally. SEA IMAGE was off very slow, then was far back early, then passed the tiring rivals. IRISH EMPRESS tracked the
early pace in between rivals and weakened. LOVE ME OR DON'T set a pressured pace on the inside and faltered. SPUN IN A MILLION stalked the pace
four wide and stopped. BELIEVE IN LOV chased the pace on the outside, made a mild bid on the outside on the turn but went bad by the quarter pole and
was pulled up, vanned off.

AMERICAN WAR HERO was settled early, ridden along three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane, was trying to lug in while closing under left
handed crop, then was up late under strong handling to prove best. PRADO ROAD prompted the early pace and made a three wide bid off the turn to take
over nearing the furlong marker, then was clear but was caught late to just miss. EDDIE FELSON was off a step slow, raced four wide entering the turn,
dropped to be two wide on the turn, then swung out five wide leaving the turn and rallied well to gain the show award. HEAVY EQUIPMENT set a pressured
pace on the inside, made a bid on the turn but faded in the lane losing the show award late. PAPPY'S REVENGE was off a step slow, then chased the pace
on the inside and faded in the drive. SANDERSON chased the early pace and weakened, dull effort. CALI HEAT hustled up to press the pace between
rivals and then weakened.

Footnotes
ZIPPER ZAPPER was well rated early on the inside, made a two wide bid on the turn to take over and draw clear, then drew out leaving the turn and
remained clear to the wire to prove much the best, driving. MELINA'S DREAM was reserved early towards the inside, came four wide into the lane and
finished well, second best. ROARING RIVER chased the pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the far turn but flattened out. ROYAL COUP was off a
step slow, then was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn and had no rally. SPEAKERIT was keen early and opened up on the first turn to set the
pace , then was headed on the turn and gave way. SUNNY SAINT stumbled at the start, then was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide
and tired. LORD DARNLEY was settled back three wide and had no response.
