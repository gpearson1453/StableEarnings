Footnotes
MISS WILD took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and tapered to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths
pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, was met into the lane but dug in determinedly to hold on. MARKETABILITY rounded the opening turn
about the three path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced two deep on the far turn, met the winner at even terms entering the
stretch and dueled gamely to the finish. LIGHTFOOT MISS saved early ground, picked up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the
four path on the far turn then dueled through the stretch to take third the final strides. HIT A HOMER HONEY raced inside on the first turn, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased outward into the lane and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch.
WOODSONG'S CASTLE rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and
was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. SO RED THE ROSE saved ground on the first turn, gave chase passing the half mile pole, rounded the far
turn off the rail and weakened in the lane. LIFE IN FLASH showed little response. UPSY DAISY DO showed little response. PRETTY SPECTACULAR was
not a factor.

Footnotes
ROCKY DICE settled in the three and four paths into the first turn, gave chase passing the nine sixteenths pole and steadily improved from that point,
rounded the far turn in the three path, dug in for the lead later yards and raced clear under the wire. ELVIRUS took over at the three quarter pole and angled
to the rail in to the first turn, came under pressure past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and dug in leaving the turn, but was met, and
relented in later yards. TOUGH TO TAME settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the
far turn, eased outward leaving the turn and dug in to take third under the wire. MYSTIFIED rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened later yards. LOKOYA ROAD saved ground on the first turn, gave chase approaching
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened stride nearing mid-stretch. LADDIE LIAM rounded the opening turn in the four path,
gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and showed little more. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE rounded the first turn in the
three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path on the far turn. ATTENTIVE was not a factor after saving early

RUNNING FREE gave chase and took the nod three wide leaving the quarter pole, raced clear midway on the turn, was steadily handled to late stretch then
taken in hand nearing the wire. GARY DOING BIZ gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn, eased out leaving the turn and dug in to clear second
later yards while gaining on the winner. AT THE HALF gave distant early chase, rounded the turn off the rail and finished well to take third later yards.
THUNDER PUNCH chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn at the rail then flattened the final sixteenth. QUEEN CASHMERE chased the early
pace inside then eased outward through the stretch while passing rivals. ONE TOUGH ROSE chased, raced in the four path on the turn and showed little in
the lane. ALWAYS SOMETHING dueled to a slim lead past the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, was met toward the quarter pole and weakened
leaving the turn. GRANDIOSELY pressured the pace and raced at even terms between horses approaching the quarter pole, but weakened leaving the turn.

NEVER COMPROMISE settled off the rail on the first turn, bid from the seven sixteenths pole and closed to the front in the three path approaching the head
of the lane, dueled clear toward mid-stretch and was kept alert the final sixteenth. THEWITCHISGONE stalked off the rail, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole and dueled to a brief lead three wide at the quarter pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, was met into the lane and flattened the final sixteenth.
GOLDEN APPEAL rounded the first turn in the three path then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced in
the five path on the far turn and came along to take third later yards. BLUE N GOLD rounded the opening turn about the three path, gave chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and showed little further. NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE raced in the four path the first turn, picked up
the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the three path and flattened in the lane. MISSIONSNINETYNINE rated a slim
lead inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, was met at the quarter, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened. RUN TO
DAYLIGHT showed little response through the backstretch. AUBURN MILL stalked inside, challenged toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the
far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
GREY BOUQUET became a bit fractious in the post parade then set a pressured pace and drew clear toward the five sixteenths pole, contested the turn at
the rail and dug in determinedly to eke out the nod over the game stretch challenge of KARMA BUS, who gave chase through the backstretch, contested at
a close disadvantage in the three path on the turn and dueled gamely to the finish. CALYPSO JOHN gave chase inside, entered the turn at the rail, was
eased to the three path through the turn and dueled in the stretch for third. ESPRESSO chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail and
was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. DIMELO PAPI pressured the early pace, dropped back toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at the
rail and flattened in the lane. ARYA CHARMING chased through the backstretch, raced close off the rail on the turn then flattened in the lane. MAGICAL
SURPRISE gave chase through the backstretch and flattened in the three path on the turn. THEIRREGISTRDIMNOT gave chased and rounded the turn off
the rail. DON'T GET CAUGHTUP was not a factor. GOLDEN ASSET gave chase and rounded the turn about the four path.

Footnotes
KING KONTIE took the lead leaving the chute and rated the early pace, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the turn,
dug in under steady stretch handling but was met at even terms under the wire. JUBAWITHATWIST chased, raced off the rail on the turn and dug in under
steady handling to reach the co-winner under the wire. RAN OUT OF TRAINER lacked early speed but steadily improved, raced at the rail on the turn and
finished evenly to take third later yards. GRANDY chased, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. TWO
BRONZE STARS gave close early chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail and flattened in the lane. KRISTINACHRYSALIS gave chase, raced at the
rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. POWERED BY LOVE gave chase and rounded the turn in the three and four paths. LOVE IS WICKED was not
a factor. DORADO chased outside, rounded the turn about the five path and weakened.

Footnotes
BIG DADDY D R ducked out leaving the gate and made contact with Got Floffy then gave chase, raced close in the three path on the turn, drifted leaving
the turn but dug in under steady handling and dueled for the nod later yards. MAGICAL EXPRESS contested the pace at mostly even terms, traversed the
turn two deep and dug in determinedly to edge out PROTA inside the sixteenth pole but was outfinished in later yards. The latter contested the pace at
mostly even terms, raced at the rail through the turn and dug in from the head of the lane, but reluctantly ceded later yards. GRAND FIBER gave chase
inside, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY was forced out leaving the gate then gave chase, raced at the rail
on the turn, angled to the six path toward the head of the lane and finished well. ZIGGY MON veered out leaving the gate then gave chase, raced at the rail
on the turn and showed little in the lane. WIZARD OF ODDS gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn and flattened in the lane. INDIANA RED
bobbled leaving the gate and never factored. GOT FLOFFY was bumped leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch and weakened in the five
path on the turn.
