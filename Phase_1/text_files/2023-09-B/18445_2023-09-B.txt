FAST EH was quickest to the turn, turned back a challenge from SS PINEAPPLE, and drove clear. SS PINEAPPLE vied between foes for the early lead,
pressed FAST EH into the final turn but lacked the rally needed. J. CRUZ lacked early speed and bid belatedly. TIMBERS MOON vied outside, and
flattened out. TRUST ELLA lacked bid. BIG BOSS chased outside and tired. THREE DAY BENDER broke slow and trailed throughout.

SMART CAT set a pressured pace inside of CAROSWAY, disposed of rival and kicked clear when asked. AMEER brushed leaving, chased the pacesetters,
and lacked a kick that was needed. REAL JUSTICE saved ground early then chased three wide leaving the backstretch, and passed tiring rival late.
CAROSWAY pressed the early pace, was unable to move on with the eventual winner, and faded. BODYMOOR HEATH raced at the back of the pack while
four wide, and was outrun.

Footnotes
DARE MIGHTY THINGS attended the early pace while three to four wide then gained an advantage along the rail, and held after a long drive. GRANDMA
DEE fanned four wide into the first turn, dueled into the stretch, and was out-finished. E PAY ALL THE WAY sent for outside speed, drove three wide into
the stretch, and closed well with energy. EL PASO brushed into the turn and weakened inside. EDDY BEAR lacked early speed, raced wide, and offered a
mild late bid. DERMOT'S DILEMMA lacked a bid. SUNNY WAY vied between rivals, lost position into the turn, and yielded.

SMILIN EVIE contested the early pace, gained the lead into the backstretch, opened up nearing the far turn, saw margins diminish late stretch and held
under a safe cushion. WILD ARCH unhurried early, gained closer order steadily through the far turn, closed determinedly but ran out of ground finishing
second best. SUDDENLY MISTY raced in the second flight, chased wide into the stretch, and passed tiring foe. EDGE OF OKOTOKS contended the early
pace, was unable to move on with the eventual winner, and faded inside. TALA outrun throughout.

CASHLINGS saved ground from a rail position, set sights on dueling leaders, angled out to the four path and got up just in time. LIL ZAPPER sent for speed
crossing over quickly to the rail, took pressure through the far turn inside of GODGUNSNCOUNTRY, dueled determinedly into the stretch, and was narrowly
denied. GODGUNSNCOUNTRY lacked a clear path leaving, raced wide through the opening turn, moved up while four wide to challenge the front, was
headed into the lane, and was bested after a long hard drive. AGENT C settled inside early, chased leaving the backstretch, and lacked room late.
OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR prompted the pace into the backstretch, and had nothing left in reserve late. SNAP COUNT lagged early and showed a mild
interest late. SPOT ON DUDE raced five to six wide through the first turn, gave chase leaving the backstretch, and flattened out. HIGH FLYIN TIGER
fanned three wide leaving the front side, and faded gradually along the rail. TRICKY SPEEDSTER was rated well off the pace, and was outrun.

READYTOTAPNSING fanned four wide leaving the opening turn, contested the lead entering the stretch, and edged away. SAXON SAGA contended the
early pace from the rail, responded to outside challengers in the final turn, and was outkicked. WALKTHELINE prompted the early pace between rivals,
pressed from the three path in the backstretch, and lacked the rally needed in the drive, just holding on for show. WAR GIANT tracked four wide into the
opening turn, gave chased in the far turn, closed gradually, and just missed. BACKSTREET BOBBY raced three wide leaving the first turn, lost position in
the backstretch, and finished up evenly. DOC COPE hustled away and dropped back through the backstretch. NORTHERN JEWEL failed to threaten. BON
PRIX fractious before the break resulting in a slow start, and trailed throughout. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Board of Stewards conducted an inquiry into
the start of the race involving BON PRIX, no change was made as it was determined that BON PRIX did receive a fair start.
