paths, closed steadily leaving the turn and got up in the final yards. MAKINLIMMARGARITAS rated a short lead off the rail, came under pressure nearing
the five sixteenths pole, extended her lead at the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady handling leaving the turn, but was caught in the final yards. EX
RATED rounded the opening turn in the three path, left the turn outside and gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn,
angled to the rail entering the stretch and finished well. DIVA ROSE came through the first turn in the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, was shut off entering the stretch, was eased out past the eighth pole and improved position. TRUE FLIRT

Footnotes
TENNIS TAP steadied leaving the gate then saved ground, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn, took over
then lugged in past the sixteenth pole and drew clear later yards. JACKYSINTHECASTLE saved ground close to the pace on the first turn, picked up the
chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn, was forced out then crowded past the eighth pole, recovered stride and got up
for second leaving the sixteenth pole. ELLIES AT WINDSOR stalked two deep on the first turn then took the nod past the half mile pole, came under
pressure toward the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn, drifted into the stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. APPEALING ROAD settled off
the rail on the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, eased out leaving the turn and passed some rivals.
WAGER WORTHY stalked from the three path on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then weakened into the far turn. BLUE
MOUNTAIN became a bit edgy in the gate, took the lead at the rail and rated the pace, was met past the half mile pole, gave chase from that point but
weakened at the rail on the far turn. SARAH'S WARRIOR became anxious in the gate, raced in the three path the first turn and showed little response
through the backstretch. The Stewards reviewed then rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Tennis Tap for alleged interference leaving the far turn,
lodged by the rider of Jackysinthecastle.

Footnotes
A LITTLE BIT CRAZY stalked from the four path the first turn and took the nod passing the half mile pole, came under pressure leaving the seven
sixteenths, rounded the far turn near the rail and was steadily handled to hold on. MIDNIGHT REGRET settled close in the four path the first turn, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and finished evenly at the outside girth of the winner. HIGHWAY QUEEN
rounded the opening turn in the three path, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and ran evenly in the stretch. HOVEL
saved early ground racing well off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and improved position. IRISH SAMURAI rounded the first
turn in the five path, gave chase from the three eighths pole but flattened in the five path on the far turn. SEEMS TO WHISPER raced with the pace inside,
gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and weakened in the lane. STOPWATCHSONNY rated close inside on the
opening turn then faded through the backstretch. SURCHARGE raced with the early pace two deep then faded after a half mile.

SMOKIN LADY bobbled leaving the gate then stalked two deep, challenged past the three eighths pole, took over two deep at the five sixteenths, dug in
under steady stretch handling and held on well. DENALI D'ORO rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and
raced in the four path on the far turn, closed for second later yards and finished well. PRINCESS HALO stalked from the four path the opening turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path on the far turn but flattened stride later yards. DEREKA'S BLUFF settled off the rail on
the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and ran evenly in the stretch. OUR GREAT NOTION moved to the
inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met passing the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn and
weakened in the lane. ODINA rounded the first turn about the four path and bid only mildly leaving the seven sixteenths pole. SNEAKY LYNK raced off the
rail on the first turn, showed little response through the backstretch and came through the far turn about the five path. HOOK THE CHAIN and
PETTYFORURTHOUGHTS saved ground.

Footnotes
GAMMA SQUEEZE took the lead while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, contested the
edge nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to eke out the advantage over BON BUENO, who settled in the three path the first turn and
started a four wide bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced close two deep on the far turn and continued to pressure the winner through the stretch.
RAGTIME RICHES saved ground on the first turn then eased out entering the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the
three path on the far turn and ran evenly to mid-stretch before flattening stride. SURF CITY GOLD rated close inside, gave chase from the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little further. ZALFIERRO settled off the rail on the first turn, started a three wide bid nearing the
three eighths pole but faded into the far turn. MR. COWBOY BRADLEY tapered in and stalked the pace two deep, challenged approaching the three eighths
pole but weakened past the five sixteenths. SEIZE THE BREEZE saved ground racing well back.

Footnotes
FEARNOUGHT stalked two deep then challenged into the backstretch, contested at a close disadvantage through the far turn but dug in undeterred to take
the nod in the final strides. MISSIONSNINETYNINE was bumped then jostled at the start but took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and rated the
pace, kept the edge over Fearnought leaving the half mile pole and contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling
leaving the turn but reluctantly ceded the nod in the final strides. SHAMELESS RISK came in and made contact with Missionsninetynine leaving the gate
and rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced close three wide on the far turn but was outfinished in the duel
through the stretch. RIVER CROSROAD RVF was forced out entering the first turn then moved to the inside into the backstretch, gave chase from the three
eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane. RUN TO DAYLIGHT rated close inside on the first turn, picked up the chase past the
seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. KAYLEE'S SPITFIRE came out and made contact with Missionsninetynine leaving the gate
then drifted into the first turn and was no factor racing wide.

Footnotes
RIVERVIEW STEVIE stalked two deep then bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead three wide midway on the far turn and was kept alert to
maintain the edge over RIDE THE RAPIDS, who stalked from the three path the first turn and gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, drew close at
the rail toward the head of the lane but reluctantly ceded the final sixteenth. MY SISTER PAM raced off the rail on the first turn then eased out into the
backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, was in range in the four path on the far turn but flattened stride into the lane. WICKED
WISDOM saved ground on the first turn, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn then flattened in the lane.
WEST VIRGINIA PAM rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened near the rail on the far turn.
BROADWAY PEGGY moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met and dropped back from
between horses toward the head of the lane and weakened. WISHING FOR SPRING entered the first turn in the six path, left the turn outside and gave
chase from the three eighths pole then flattened at the rail on the far turn. LILY'S LEAD was not a factor. WICKED SAUCY drifted into the first turn, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole then faded through the far turn.
