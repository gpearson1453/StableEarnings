Footnotes
COURT RULER (IRE) jumped well tracking the pace along the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under urging three furlongs from home, dug in
under a drive rallying to collar the leader a sixteenth from home, then inched away to the finish kept to task. GLOBAL FREEDOM (GB) pulled on the bit early
on under restraint before settling in hand showing the way along the inside, jumped late at fence four, remained patiently handled until confronted a furlong
from home and was set down in response, dug in under threat getting collared with a sixteenth remaining and ran on to preserve the place honors. ZOOM
ZOOM ZOE (IRE) tracked the pace just off the inside from mid pack, jumped well to maintain position, got roused at the head of the stretch and kept on to
secure the show honors. PRAYER HOPE saved ground just off the pace, came under urging after the final flight through the final turn and weakened in the
flat. BRIANBAKESCOOKIES saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, jumped late at fence two and at fence seven losing some position at both jumps, came
under urging after the final fence and weakened. ANTICIPATING tracked the pace along the inside jumping late at the first flight and then well at the
following seven fences, came under a drive after clearing the final fence through the final turn and made no headway. FEARSOME (GB) chased just off the
inside without mishap, came under urging after the final fence, offered little response, tired and was eased through the final furlong to the wire.

Footnotes
STRIKE THAT angled in while going to the front, controlled the action while inside through the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole,
extended the advantage under a strong hand ride in upper stretch, was put to a left-handed whip at the furlong marker, had the rider put the stick away at
the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. GUN IT was slow into stride and spotted the front over two lengths, moved up on the outside
with five furlongs to run, stalked the winner while four then three wide on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, pursued the winner under a strong
hand ride in upper stretch, was given one crack of a right-handed whip nearing the furlong marker then shied out when switched to a left-handed whip, was
corrected by the rider with a hard tug of the left rein, fought gamely with DINAR for the place and narrowly earned that position while no match for the
winner. DINAR bumped lightly with a rival at the start, was taken in hand early then hard held while narrowly avoiding hitting the rail entering the main-track,
raced off the pace under restraint, drafted inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed
whip while chasing in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with the runner-up for the place to the wire and just
missed that position while clear for the show. TIZ HE THE ONE stumbled at the start then bumped lightly with a foe, spotted the front a couple of lengths,
moved out early then settled off the pace, came under urging around the nine-sixteenths, went three then four wide on the turn, was roused for more at the
five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under a right-handed whip, continued on his inside lead under a right-handed whip until near the furlong marker then
was switched to a left-handed whip, swapped to the proper lead while just outside the wayward GUN IT shortly thereafter and weakened.
RELEASETHETHUNDER was taken in hand then rated off the pace, raced between horses into the turn then came under urging in the two path, moved to
the three path under a ride at the five-sixteenths and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DARING DISGUISE one of the quickest out of the starting gate despite breaking slightly to the outside, remained forwardly placed, prompted the pace from
path two, came under some hand urging after falling back during the run around the bend, challenged in earnest spinning into the lane, hitched up to the
FLUENT IN SARCASM once again, vied with vigour with that foe beginning from deep into the furlong grounds, proved best then edged away in the final
seventy yards. FLUENT IN SARCASM emerged from a tight pack at the break with a clear advantage, cut over to the inside, eventually taking up residence
along the outer rim of the inside route, inched away from the top one for a spell during the trip on the turn, settled into upper stretch and was given his cue,
left the eighth pole fully engaged with DARING DISGUISE, relinquished but would go on to do battle until well inside the sixteenth marker, narrowly saved
second. INSPECTOR HENNING tracked the top twosome from the pocket, was under a drive cutting the corner in to the stretch, angled to the outside with
approximately a sixteenth to go, kicked into its best stride, fell short of snagging the place. MONEY IN THE BANK had the rider take hold with ongoing light
contact involving a couple of others going on near by, tucked along the hedge by the conclusion of the backstretch, stayed on it, fanned out into path six
from upper to midstretch, rallied with late foot en route for the final significant slice of the purse. VICTORY BUILT spotted along the hedge in short order,
swung out four wide into the stretch, rallied mildly. SHANDIAN sat well reserved in path two after brushing with SNAPPY CAT in the shadow of the starting
gate, commenced the stretch slightly wider, lacked the needed response. HAY LAD forwardly placed three wide, got sent out five wide for the drive, gave
way. SNAPPY CAT made light contact with SHANDIAN at the start, took up the chase from the two path on the turn, failed to make its presence felt.

SCANNO became rank under a vigorous hold in the two path on the first turn then dropped back, was reserved towards the rear, went three wide for most of
the far turn, shifted five wide while roused outside the quarter-pole, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed fast under a strong hand ride to get the lead
outside the furlong marker, led under a right-handed whip into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. BREAK BEAT was hustled from the
start, disputed the pace on the inside while inside of a foe, came under coaxing with a half-mile to run, vied inside under urging on the far turn, was put to
the whip at the five-sixteenths, fought on gamely along the hedge in the stretch but missed while able to get the place. DIGITAL SOFTWARE saved ground
on the first turn, was rated off the pace under tight restraint, drafted in the two path on the far turn, waited behind horses from the quarter-pole to the
three-sixteenths, had a very brief opening close faster then he could accelerate through it and continued behind horses, altered to the outside under a
left-handed whip into the final furlong and finished with good energy but was too late while able to get the show. GUNMAN went three wide on the first turn,
was rated while tracking the leading duo, came under urging in the three path on the far turn, made an outside bid at the five-sixteenths then was asked for
more, came under a right-handed whip in upper stretch, battled between horses into the final furlong and was out-kicked. UNION COLONEL went around
the first turn in the three path, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole then came under
the whip in upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong then tired. TIZ THE JOURNEY was last to commence, went around the first turn in the
two path, settled at the rear of the field, was roused while inside early on the far turn then shifted three wide at the five-sixteenths, was put to the whip at that
point, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. FREEDOM FORCE was taken back early, went four wide early on the first turn, raced
outside under restraint without cover, went four wide on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, chased into upper stretch and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
SINGLE VERSE off the inside throughout, stalked the pace two to three wide, flashed interest as the half was being completed, maintained the momentum
spinning into the lane, challenging in earnest three wide, narrowly struck the front end by the eighth pole, edged away from a pesky SHESASUPERFREAK
then held on gamely to preserve the decision. BUSTIN SCONES underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, swung out four wide for the drive, had a good
finish down the center of the strip to be along for the place. SHESASUPERFREAK established the top shortly after the field had been sent off and running,
got set up from just off the rail, carved out the pace for the most part loosely-pressed until the final jumps of the run around the bend, shifted towards path
two when asked for meet the bid being mustered up by SINGLE VERSE at the top of the lane, reluctantly got headed, forged on ahead with good courage,
saw the pilot lose the whip in midlane, weakened late into the show slot. KINKY SOX two wide entering the turn, got sent out five wide exiting it, made some
headway in the last eighth to earn the last major check. SARATOGA BEAUTY eyed the pace from the pocket, cut the corner with sufficient room with which
to launch a rally of her own, wasn't up to the task at hand. FIGHT ON LUCY saved ground for nearly a half, got let out a short distance from the quarter
pole, tipped into the two path at the head of the stretch, lacked the necessary response.

of the far turn under his own power, got set down continuing three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, edged away under a drive,
saw some of that margin cut into while safely in front to the wire. TACKLE tracked the pace just off the inside from mid pack, tucked inside at the
seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the place honors.
SCUTTLEBUZZ got bumped after the start by TRUE PALACE who was away in a bit of a tangle, raced three wide through the opening bend before chasing
three wide fro mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. NEURO three
wide through the first turn, chased two to three wide until tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside for home and ran on for the last major share. JADE'S DREAM two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, got coaxed along at the
five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE tracked the pace along
the inside through the first turn before advancing into the backstretch to take over command with five and a half furlongs to run, showed the way in hand
inside down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole under challenge to the outside, took the inside route
into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong from home, then weakened in the late going. VOLIERO three wide through the first turn,
chased three wide from just off the pace, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home offering a mild bid, couldn't sustain the move
and weakened in the late stages. MUNDACIOUS just off the inside just off the pace, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. SANDRO THE GREAT got carried out five wide into upper
stretch when SOUTH AFRICA spun four wide into that bend along his inside, raced four to five wide through the turn until tucked to the inside near the rear
of the field down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, cut the corner into upper stretch and made no impact. A VOW OF BEAUTY four wide
through the first turn, chased four paths off the hedge until tucked to the two path into the far turn placed to coaxing, swung three to four wide for home and
offered no rally. SOUTH AFRICA floated four wide into first turn carrying SANDRO THE GREAT five wide, raced four wide through the first turn before
chasing three to four wide down the backstretch through to upper stretch and made no impact. TRUE PALACE broke out brushing the off side stall at the

two to three wide into upper stretch and trailed.

THOUGHTFULLY away without apparent mishap, made her way into path two by the conclusion of the backstretch, got mildly shuffled on the turn, drafting
behind AVA'S GRACE, was cued angling to the outside prior to spinning into the stretch, straightened away four wide at the head of the stretch and went
after the ones to catch in earnest, out-fought a pair of opponents to her left between the three-sixteenths pole and the eighth pole to take over, kicked clear.
MAKE MISCHIEF broke to the outside, got corrected but not before bumping lightly with her next stall neighbor, assumed a prominent position, prompted
AVA'S GRACE while being rated well rated three wide, got asked for more turning into the lane, vied from between rivals for a sixteenth, beginning from the
vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, saw the winner cement herself to the front end, stayed on second. AVA'S GRACE established the top after the field had
been sent off and running, showed the way towards path two, tailed by the second place finisher, was turned loose at the quarter pole, came under pressure
from the top twosome soon afterwards, gave in, kept going well enough to hold for the show. LILAC LACE guided over to the rail by midway on the
backstretch, tracked the pace while continuing along the inside, for the most part without benefit of cover, was being roused cutting the corner into the
stretch, idled behind the front runners taking up the chase from along a usable path, came up empty when it widened with a furlong to go and backed away.
LUCIFERS LAIR at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, pursued the pace three to four wide on the turn, as the widest of all, got driven out
towards path five entering the stretch, venturing onward as the widest of all, failed to make any headway, then after being switched over to much lighter
handling, was allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
GRINGOTTS five paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit from mid pack, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, drifted in from the three-sixteenths to the eighth pole taking command inside that station when
corrected, then edged away under a drive to prevail. MEBS WEB lunged through the stall door just as the latch was sprung, chased just off the pace from
just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs out, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in between foes
from the three-sixteenths to inside the eighth pole, then ran on to secure the place honors. LOVE ME TOMORROW five paths off the inside early on,
advanced to take over command six furlongs out and crossed to the two path with five furlongs remaining showing the way on a lone lead, tucked inside into
the turn and had MIA BEA STAR advance outside and was under pressure from that rival from the three-eighths to the top of the stretch when taking the
inside route into upper stretch, dug in shaking away to the eighth pole, got collared inside that station and weakened in the late stages. MIA BEA STAR
bobbled at the start, chased four then three wide in closest aim of the leader before tucking to the two path through the turn advancing to press the front
from the outside from the three-eighths to the quarter pole under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, got shaken off nearing
the eighth pole and weakened. CRICK bobbled at the break, chased three wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn under coaxing
from the seven-sixteenths, continued five wide for home, offered up a mild bid to the furlong grounds then flattened out through the final eighth.
AGGRAVATION coaxed from the start, chased four wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. DEEPLY ANALYTICAL bobbled at the start, recovered to lead briefly before being displaced by LOVE ME TOMORROW six furlongs from home,
chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. PEERLESS three then two
wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs out, angled three to four wide at the top of the stretch and tired.
