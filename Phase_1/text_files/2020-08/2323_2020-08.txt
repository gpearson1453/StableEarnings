Footnotes
ENTRY TO HEAVEN was a tad slow off the mark, quickly recovered to move up three wide into a stalking position into the turn, stayed three wide to loom
up as they turned for home, fell back in upper stretch but came again in the final sixteenth, driving past the leader in the final strides. AIM FOR THE SKY led
quickly, kept a length or so advantage around the turn, opened a bigger lead down the stretch but failed to hold off the winner's charge, a solid second best.
READY SOUL broke out at the start but quickly recovered to track the leader inside, awaiting room throughout but a clear path never appeared, seemingly
having run but not being able to use it, holding the show when the top two separated themselves nearing the wire. CHECKERBOARD FLOOR stalked his
stablemate throughout, stayed in contention in between rivals down the stretch, jumping on and off his wrong lead while battling on for a minor award.
SHENNAN (IRE) settled in midpack, was on hold behind rivals before swinging out two to five wide late turn, came into the six path turning for home and
looked set for a run but hung in the final seventy yards. BATTLE OF YORKTOWN was off the pace, roused by his rider around the turn, angled out in upper
stretch in behind runners and shifted out again by the sixteenth pole but by then the race was over, never getting his chance to kick it in. THY KINGDOM
was crowded by a rival to his inside at the start and fell off the pace, trailed the field midway on the turn and passed a outfinished a couple late, never a
threat. MACADE was off the pace and two to three wide on the turn, never reaching contention in the stretch. MORE CHANCES trailed the field early before
advancing three to six wide on the turn, was in the eight path turning for home but tired and dropped back down the lane.

TOO LEGIT showed brief speed along with several rivals, forced the pace into the turn, dogged the leader, challenged upper stretch, drove clear and held
sway under steady pressure. TRIGGER'S BAY raced in mid pack, chased three then two-wide on the turn, cut to the rail in the stretch and finished gamely.
TOOK A WRONG TURN had early speed, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive.
COMMANDER TOM moved up the rail to duel on the main track, gained the lead and set a pressured pace, was headed a furlong out and gave way. PINK
GELATO, in range early, was hustled from the rail on the turn then finished evenly. ROYAL BOURBON settled off the pace, chased hard three and
four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. SUIGU STAR, outrun early, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn but was never in
contention. IMA SILENT FORCE hopped at the outset, raced in mid pack, chased from the rail on the turn but failed to menace. CUMPLEANOS also had
brief speed, dropped back late turn and lacked a rally.

held sway under a hand ride. BAY OF RUM, in range, raced along the rail and two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished determinedly
between foes. BIG LEAGUE stalked the pace, came two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, closed gamely but lost the place position late.
CONSTANTINO stalked the pace from the rail, angled out in the stretch then evened out in the late stages. BEN LOMOND settled in mid pack, saved
ground on the turn, lost his path several times in the stretch then rallied late. SLIP KID settled off the pace, closed four-wide late turn then chased through
the stretch. DISTINCT PASSION settled in mid pack, was taken back a bit early turn and was in between foes then was spotted behind traffic through the
stretch. KITCHEN FIRE moved clear quickly, set a reserved pace, was headed in the final furlong and retreated. AURORA D'ORO, in range, came
three-wide through the turn then flattened out in the stretch.

AMNESTY, off slowly, stalked the pace, was blocked along the rail at the top of the stretch, slipped inside the leader when the window presented itself and
moved clear then held sway under a hand ride. VICTOR'S DESTINY was pinched back at the start and settled at the back of the pack, raced three to
five-wide through the turn, came out at the top of the stretch then rallied gamely.. MC CULLEY settled at the rear, came four to six-wide through the turn,
lost his path and was checked at the top of the stretch then rallied gamely. RADIO NOWHERE dueled along the rail, was headed upper stretch and chased
in vain. SEAMUS dueled, backed away approaching the turn, took a three-wide run at the leaders late turn, was prominent in the stretch but evened out in
the late stages. CAPTURE THE MUSIC, off slowly, raced from the back of the pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch
and evened out late. CHESTERMERE dueled two-wide, gave way upper stretch and offered no further response.A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
INCIDENT AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH CONCERNING VICTOR'S DESTINY AND MCCULLEY RESULTED IN VICTOR'S DESTINY BEING

Footnotes
TRANQUILITY BASE stalked the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn, was involved in repeated sharp bumps in upper stretch between himself
and MAKE IT RAIN, rallied when clear and took command with a strong bid in the late stages. ANIMAL KRACKERS broke outward then settled in range,
chased four-wide leaving the turn, was lugging in badly and repeatedly came in and bumped MAKE IT RAIN, battled for the lead when clear and was in
hand late. VALUABLE PILLOW dueled two-wide, was bumped by TRANQUILITY BASE upper stretch and was banged about by that one and ANIMAL
KRACKERS in the late stages and gave way. THE NEWFIE EXPRESS raced in mid pack, came four-wide through the turn then rallied gamely from the
outside. SOCIETY MISFIT settled in mid pack, came three then two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, encountered serious traffic and was
careful not to get into the war then evened out late. G PRINCE OF SILVER dueled from the rail, gained a short lead on the turn, was engaged late turn,
yielded mid stretch and faded. GIVE ME AN EYE broke outward and bumped MAKE IT RAIN, settled well off the pace, was hustled angling from the rail to
three-wide late turn but failed to menace. MAKE IT RAIN was bumped at the start but gained position in striking range, came three and four-wide through
the turn, chased into the stretch where he was bumped sharply and repeatedly by ANIMAL KRACKERS and with TRANQUILITY BASE, then evened out in
mid stretch. ANOTHER BREEZE dueled briefly then stalked the pace from the rail, was eased upper stretch, crossed the wire and walked off. THERE WAS
A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE BUMPING IN THE STRETCH. THE TRAINER OF VALUABLE PILLOW LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST
TRANQUILITY AND ANIMAL KRACKERS FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. THE JOCKEY OF MAKE IT RAIN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINST TRANQUILITY BASE AND ANIMAL KRACKERS FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED ANIMAL KRACKERS AND PLACED HIM EIGHTH.
