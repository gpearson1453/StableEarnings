Footnotes
TARAFIRMA was hustled to the front at once, saved ground around the turn and was under intermittent urging through the lane. POLISHED GAL chased
two wide between rivals and lacked the needed rally. WOLFBLADE was slow early, steadied along the rail while trying to rally midway on the turn, stayed
along the rail into the final furlong, angled out and closed well. PARANOIA wasn't far back outside early, raced three wide around the turn and weakened.
LULU ISLAND had early position inside, was brushed nearing the turn then weakened in the lane. JERSEY LIFE came in, brushed LULU ISLAND while not
far back between rivals nearing the turn, bore out entering the turn, angled in sharply in front of WOLFBLADE midway on the turn then tired in the lane.
HURRICANE PATRICIA was no factor. HILL VALLEY was outrun.

Footnotes
KISS MY NOTE angled to the outside while not far back midway on the backstretch, rallied four wide around the final turn then ran clear from the outside
through late stretch. KENDAMA was caught four wide while unhurried around the first turn, raced two wide around the final turn and closed willingly outside.
TACHYON was steadied in tight repeatedly through much of the opening six furlongs, lacked room between horses nearing the stretch, edged out in the
drive and finished willingly. PRIZED MERRY took command soon after the break, stayed along the rail while making the way for over three-quarters and
continued with good courage once displaced. JAG had position three wide, moved to a short lead nearing the stretch then gave way late. O K GAME ON
stayed inside, lacked room approaching the lane, remained close into the final furlong then weakened. HE'S ZIPPIN ON BY pressed two wide outside the
early leader for over six furlongs then weakened. FEDERAL DOMINANCE was no factor. IYWAAN was caught in tight along the rail around the first turn and
tired. JONATHANTOQUICK was outrun.

GOLIGHTLY rallied the rail around the final turn, came out for the drive and drew clear. ZANDORA made a two wide run around the final turn, took over
from between rivals in early stretch then was little match. CASE DISMISSED lagged then made a strong late run along the rail. MISS FORESTER improved
position between rivals into the stretch then lacked a further response. MISTRESS AT SEA moved two wide to a clear lead before a quarter, angled to the
rail then tired in the lane. SPRING AWAY was no factor. SIX PACK GAL was finished early. GIA ALEXA stopped and was eased up.
