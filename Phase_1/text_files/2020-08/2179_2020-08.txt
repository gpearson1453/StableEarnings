Footnotes
RAINING SUNSHINE settled off the leading trio early, advanced four wide midway on the turn, took over outside MON PETIT CHOU at the top of the
stretch, moved away under a mild drive, and coasted in the last sixteenth of a mile. SHANG'S SISTER saved ground outrun to the stretch, moved out three
wide and was up inside DEM A WONDER for second. DEM A WONDER broke in a tangle, raced five wide around the turn, rallied mildly on her left lead and
was edged for the place. MON PETIT CHOU was bumped lightly by TURN IT ON at the start, vied outside BATTLE CRY and NAVAL WAVE early, got the
best of that battle but was no match for the winner at the head of the lane, and weakened giving up larger shares late. GLITTER BAY had the two-path on
the turn, and made no impact. BATTLE CRY vied inside rivals for three furlongs, and tired. TURN IT ON broke out bumping MON PETIT CHOU lightly, and
was outrun three wide. NAVAL WAVE contested the pace between horses, and faltered leaving the turn.

Footnotes
SUBTLE JOY sped clear early in the two-path, moved inside showing the way up the backstretch, got headed by WONDER BLONDY after six furlongs, dug
in shoulder to shoulder through a long drive and edged away late. WONDER BLONDY was bumped by DONNAMEUP at the start, went along unhurried
early, began moving three wide after completing a half-mile, poked a head in front outside SUBTLE JOY midway on the far turn, battled the rest of the way
and yielded late. CALLMESENORITA came three wide off the far turn with the dueling leaders in sight, and could not reach them with an even finish.
CAMELLIA GAL chased three wide early, came under a ride leaving the half-mile pole, and tired. DONNAMEUP broke out bumping WONDER BLONDY,
saved ground on the first turn, moved out three wide approaching the stretch and dropped well back. V K LEGACY was finished after six furlongs.

Footnotes
TAKECHARGE MIRELLA stayed close early, closed in outside SHALL RETURN slowly but surely around the turn, wrested command through mid stretch
and drove clear. SHALL RETURN sped clear shortly before completing a quarter-mile, saw a good portion of her lead whittled away around the turn, could
not match strides with the winner entering the last furlong and remained clear of the rest. SALSA RITA raced three wide around the turn, and could not
seriously menace with an even finish. NOWITNA RIVER was outsprinted in the two-path for a half-mile, moved inside for the drive and gained mildly for the
last major share. BABY ICE tired inside after a half. CITIBIKE was hustled along to stay close early between horses, and gave way before reaching the
stretch. SI TE VAS hit the left side of the gate to get away slowest, and trailed three wide.

Footnotes
DANCE D'ORO took control after the start, rated along slightly off the rail, dug in gamely when challenged in deep stretch and was held together for the
score under strong handling. ESTILO TALENTOSO moved up leaving the chute, found herself hemmed in past the quarter-pole and into upper stretch,
finally was able to maneuver outside the leader past the eighth-pole, gained gradually and did not have enough. HEIRESSINDY prompted the pace outside
DANCE D'ORO, came under a ride three furlongs out, kept ESTILO TALENTOSO boxed in from the quarter-pole to the furlong grounds, and weakened
from there. DON'T GET KHOZY was put to pressure midway on the turn four wide, and lacked the needed bid.

Footnotes
SINGINGINTHEJOHN was off awkwardly behind the field, moved up early in the two-path, began picking it up midway on the turn being guided five wide,
caught WESLEY OWEN from outside approaching the eighth-pole and moved away under pressure. OROSCOPO raced forwardly three then two wide for a
half-mile, shifted out a bit and went clear late for second while never a threat to the winner. WESLEY OWEN bumped with POZNAN after the start, grabbed
the early lead inside, shook off GRAY BULLET into the turn, moved off the inside in upper stretch, and weakened through the late stages staying on his left
lead. POZNAN bumped with WESLEY OWEN after the start, improved position four wide around the turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch.
DRACARYS FIRE raced three wide and posed no threat. AUGER became highly unsettled by kickback up the backstretch, and had no rally. TEN MILES
HIGH brushed with FIRST IN LINE after the start, and faded early four wide. GRAY BULLET bumped with GROOMSMAN at the start, chased outside
WESLEY OWEN to the turn, and faded steadily after a half. FIRST IN LINE leaned out brushing TEN MILES HIGH after the start, and was always outrun.
WILD WINE loaded reluctantly without the rider, and showed little. GROOMSMAN bumped with GRAY BULLET at the start, and was far back throughout.
CROCODILE BITE was sent hard from the gate to no avail, and was eased up when hopelessly beaten.

GLORY OF FLORIDA tracked outside the early leaders, took over confidently from TAP THE MOJO after six furlongs, and drove clear. FIFTH TITLE
advanced three wide on the turn, and was along for the place without menacing the winner. TAP THE MOJO vied outside JUST THE FACTS early, was
under a drive and unable to fend off GLORY OF FLORIDA five-sixteenths out, and weakened through the lane on his left lead. JUST THE FACTS contested
the pace inside TAP THE MOJO for a half-mile, gave way around the turn, and continued along on his left lead. NEW YORK STYLE was finished early, and
eased up at the top of the lane. This race was hand timed.

CHARGE ACCOUNT was outrun early, moved up around the turn four wide, drifted out rallying on the far outside, and wore down PANAREA through the
last sixteenth of a mile. PANAREA went along with a loose shadow roll flapping around early, had it fall off as she began moving four wide leaving the
backstretch, took over outside REITERATE turning for home and pulled clear, but could not withstand the winner late. WORDS OF DEVINE was a step slow
and lacked room behind NAPA RULES and PANAREA after the start, advanced around the turn in the two-path, finished up one-paced and just got the
show. MS BIG SPRING tracked outside the early leaders, weakened after a half-mile, and drifted out through the lane. NAPA RULES broke outward, vied
outside REITERATE early, weakened late on the turn, and drifted out in the stretch. REITERATE set a pressured pace inside, yielded to PANAREA turning
for home, and faded on the fence. BLESSED BEAST was finished early inside. HARTLING trailed throughout near the three-path.

Footnotes
VINNIE VAN GO vied outside ROYAL DUKE early, faced outside pressure from KYLE and UNPUBLISHED around the turn as well, shook clear after a
half-mile under a drive, and was kept busy shown the whip and hand urged late. NACHO PAPA broke in bumping HONOLULU EXPRESS after the start,
raced three then two wide outsprinted around the turn, and finished willingly. ROYAL DUKE was sent from the gate to duel inside VINNIE VAN GO, yielded
five-sixteenths out dropping back, came back on rallying back into second through upper stretch, but lost that spot in the closing yards. UNCAPTURED
KING bumped with HONOLULU EXPRESS at the start, lagged well back early inside, moved out four wide around the turn, went back in through upper
stretch and rallied mildly for the last major share. KYLE pressed the early pace outside, challenged three wide between horses on the turn, and faded
through the stretch. UNPUBLISHED ranged up to join the leaders four wide on the turn, but could not sustain the bid and tired. MASERATI MAN moved in
from the four-path midway on the turn, and was finished after a half. HONOLULU EXPRESS bumped with UNCAPTURED KING at the start, got bumped by
NACHO PAPA a stride later, and retired early.

Footnotes
COOL ARROW hugged the rail inching up closer to the leaders on the turn, shot through to seize command inside RUNNING FOR RIZ at the top of the
stretch, and drew off under a drive. GARTER AND TIE hit the left side of the gate at the start, was under a full drive outside the front flight past the
five-sixteenths, lost ground coming off the turn, and came back on widest through the late stages to get second. ROYAL SQUEEZE chased outside
RUNNING FOR RIZ early, challenged in the three-path between horses on the turn, and weakened in the last eighth of a mile. MI TRES POR CIENTO
(CHI) was slow into stride, saved ground throughout, and lacked the needed response. RUNNING FOR RIZ sped clear after the start and staked out the
two-path, faced pressure from both flanks after a half-mile, and folded up. ART G IS BACK was two wide and finished after a half.

STORM THE BRIDGE stayed in range early, got put to pressure three wide late on the turn, caught DISTURBIN BOURBON from outside while drifting out
near the sixteenth-pole, and held YES FOR LESS safe to the finish. YES FOR LESS broke out brushing with SMASH, lagged well back for a half-mile,
swung widest for the drive and finished well too late. MOON PISTOL got bumped by STARSHIP TAXI at the start, was outrun to the stretch three wide, and
finished willingly between horses. STARSHIP TAXI broke out bumping MOON PISTOL, advanced mildly four wide after a half-mile, and ran on evenly
between horses. DISTURBIN BOURBON came out several paths after the start, was corrected and chased after BROADWAY PETE, took over from outside
at the top of the stretch, pulled clear with a furlong remaining, but was overrun the last sixteenth of a mile. POPPY'S DESTINY shifted out five wide in range
late on the turn, and lacked a solid response. SUNDOWN KID bumped with SMASH after the start, settled in the middle of the field saving ground early, put
in a mild run in the two-path coming off the turn, but flattened out past the eighth-pole. STEADILY broke slowly and trailed inside early, angled wide into the
