Footnotes
KISSABLE U pressed the pace of SHELBY R. while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths pole, vied with that foe and drew off
through the final sixteenth. SHELBY R. set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by the winner with three furlongs to run, vied, but
could not match strides with that rival late. FULL SPEED AHEAD broke out, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in
approaching the stretch and finished with good late energy. URBAN DIVA pressed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way. MISS VANJIE NATION
lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to menace. THECHAMPISFLORING broke out, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide
through the turn and was not a factor.

DRAGON LADY was away in good order to press the pace of CLONGIFFEN from between foes, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
vied with CALPSO QUEEN and drew off through the final furlong. I C FIRE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, could not
gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. CALYPSO QUEEN raced four-wide through the first turn, press the pace while
racing four-wide, moved in tandem with the winner to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with that rival and gave way through the final furlong.
WAIT AND SEE settled off the leaders early, steadied nearing the thirteen-sixteenths pole, moved three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
AUNTIE CHIANTI was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. CLONGIFFEN broke sharply
to set a pressured pace from off the rail and weakened after going three-quarters. JOHNNIE GUITAR lacked early foot, saved ground through the second
turn and did not menace.

Footnotes
LICORICE DROP POPS lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew off. TIGER ON YOUR SIX set
a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole but could not hold his stable-mate safe in the drive. PAMPER ME
NOW was fractious at the gate, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, reached a contending position but failed
to gain late. SLEET AFLEET chased the leaders while racing three-wide and lacked the needed closing response. ALIANTE was forwardly placed from the
inside, drifted nearing the quarter and failed to gain in the drive. TRIPLE G hopped at the start, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
turn and weakened. ROB'S GOT GAME was away in good order to press the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.

Footnotes
LADY CAMPBELL dueled for the lead with PORT LIONS while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths pole and was ridden out
to the wire to be kept to task. LINCHPINS JEWEL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in
the drive but held on to save the place. NATIONAL HEROINE bobbled at the start then was allowed to settle, raced five-wide through the turn and finished
with a steady rally. LINCHPINS WAKE was off a step slow, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the sixteenth pole and
finished evenly. PEACEABLE KINGDOM was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and gave way. DATCAT raced off the pacesetters
early, moved six-wide through the turn and weakened. PORT LIONS was away in good order to dispute the pace from the inside and weakened after going
a half.

JUDICIAL was hustled along to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear.
CHEROKEE LOUISE lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, offered a bid in tandem with the winner in
mid-stretch but could not match strides with that rival late. TIGER MOM settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in
mid-stretch and finished willingly. SIERRA SUNRISE lagged early, saved ground through the turn and finished with good late energy. PERFECT PROMISE
sprinted clear before going a quarter, raced three-wide while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. PRE MO DIAMOND chased the
leaders while racing five-wide and weakened after going a half. TIMBERLAKE GAGE was forwardly placed early then fanned seven-wide and weakened
after going three furlongs.

PREACHINATDINNER raced four-wide through the first turn while unhurried, moved three-wide through the second turn, responded through the final
sixteenth and was up late. COLEINATOR was bumped at the start, opened a clear lead soon after, responded when challenged by RI' PIN SNAP nearing
the half and gave way grudgingly to the winner late. MOLAF checked soon after the start, raced just off the leaders from the inside, moved up for a striking
position into the stretch, raced in tight quarters nearing the sixteenth pole and could not get by the winner. RIGGSKI was bumped at the break then
forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed closing response. MAE BELLE PASSE was never far back, raced
five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. STANLEY RYDER settled of the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn,
angled out further into the stretch and failed to menace. SILVER ATTACHE raced four-wide through the first turn, lagged early, raced three-wide through the
second turn and did not reach contention. PEGASUS CHAMP broke sharply then lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a
factor. RI' PIN SNAP chased the pace of COLENATOR while racing three-wide, offered a bid nearing the half and weakened soon after.

Footnotes
WINDRIBBON was away in good order to dispute the early fractions with FUZZY DOLPHIN, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear lead
with a furlong to run and held off the closing LA WAUN by a diminishing margin. LA WAUN was off slow, pulled to contend, raced just off the leaders under
restraint, moved three-wide through the turn, rallied when set down for the drive and just missed. GRINDER SPARKSAGLO lacked early foot, raced
five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good late energy. FUZZY DOLPHIN dueled for the lead from the inside with
the winner and gave way to that rival after going a half. SKY CONFIDENTIAL lagged early, raced off the rail through the turn and finished with some late
run. BULLET DRILL settled just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. HOLLYWOOD AS USUAL chased the
leaders from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
FIERY CAUSE broke sharply to duel for the lead with CATE'S GOLD from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and drew off with complete
authority. SHE'S AN EAGLE broke awkwardly and was bumped, raced just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive but could not gain
on the winner late. BELL OF RAINIER settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, drifted out further into the stretch and was up for the
show. GLAMSQUAD lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. CATE'S GOLD was away in good order to dispute
the early fractions with the winner and weakened after going a half. SADIE SUE was bumped at the break then forwardly placed, moved five-wide through
the turn and gradually weakened. PORTRAY UR VISION was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
MAIKA settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.
