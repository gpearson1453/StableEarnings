Footnotes
MY MARC ANDRE stalked the early leader, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. EBORACUM
was in touch, a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. FLAMBORO JEWEL set the pace but was headed
mid turn and had nothing left. MADSAM was off the pace, showed little and was never a threat. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON EBORACUM
AGAINST MY MARC ANDRE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE EARLY RUN LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

GIANTBALLS OF FIRE was unhurried early, gained ground on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch drew clear. QUEEN'SPLATE
NOLAN had no speed and was a factor on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. STONEAWAY was up
close and had a slim lead on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch gave way. SOUL N' SPIRIT was in mid pack, saved ground on the
far turn and was up for a share. TIZ TAP TANGO was well back, trailed the field on the far turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. CONQUER THE
BREEZE was in touch and roused on the far turn but was no real threat. UPLIFTING SPIRIT was hustled early but headed on the far turn and came up
empty. ALTER EGO was in range early, lost ground on the far turn, pulled up in mid stretch and walked off. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON
QUEEN'SPLATE NOLAN AGAINST GIANTBALLS OF FIRE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE GOING INTO THE FIRST TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

OMI'S BOY set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and widened under light handling through the stretch. LEWNSKYSWILDAFFAIR tracked the early
leader, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. STREET CAT SAM was off the pace and moved up
on the turn but leveled off through the stretch. POOL PLAYA stalked the leaders from the outside and was roused on the turn but from the five path at the
top of the stretch had no response. HOLYSNAPENEYEBALLS was unhurried early and raced evenly on the turn but failed to fire. WATCH THIS was in
touch early but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

Footnotes
YALLHAVEANICEDAY dueled early, had the lead on the turn and with mild pressure through the stretch held sway. SUMMER RETREAT was away alertly,
a factor on the turn and held place. TREBEK was in touch and had a good position on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more.
SOPHISTICATION was well back, closed gap on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch gained gradually. HIDDEN ARTIFACT was in range
but chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. MILWAUKEE MAGIC had no speed and saved ground on the turn but had
no impact. MARCUS dwelt at the start and showed nothing while outrun.

Footnotes
MUSICAL FLIGHT set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. CICIBONNE was off the pace,
moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. MADAME BOVERY stalked the early leader and was a
factor on the turn but needed more. TRICKERATION was away alertly and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no
response. CALM IT had no speed and showed little in a dull effort. TARAVILA was hustled early but trailed the field on the turn and dropped back through
the stretch.
