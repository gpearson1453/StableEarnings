to take command near the eighth pole, dug in under a drive under challenge from a pair and held gamely to prevail coming out very slightly and leaning on
SOMEBODY steps from the wire. SOMEBODY coaxed from the gate, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside
through the turn placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through
the final furlong in tandem with LATER CAT to his outside, ran on between foes, got leaned on in the final jumps and was staved off at the end. LATER CAT

three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to threaten in concert with the aforementioned foe through the final furlong,
ran on to the finish but was ultimately rebuffed to the line. STRONG ONE got bumped twice at the start by INTERNET OF THINGS and bumped with
INVEST after the second bump, prompted the leader from the outside in the two path, got briefly carried three wide before tucking back to the two path into
the turn under a firm hold and advanced to take over command seven-sixteenths from home, remained on hold until near the quarter pole, cut the corner
into upper stretch under urging, briefly gave the slip to BEBE BANKER straightened away, dug in and got collared nearing the eighth pole and weakened
through to the finish. CALL THE CAT coaxed from the gate, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path briefly half
a mile from home, went three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home and offered no rally. INTERNET
OF THINGS broke out at the start under coaxing and bumped STRONG ONE twice, vied briefly with rivals before establishing sole command in hand along
the inside under some pressure from STRONG ONE to the outside, floated briefly to the two path carrying his main prompter three wide into the turn, came
under coaxing displaced from the front at the seven-sixteenths, faded urged along through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.
INDIGO YANKEE six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn and was put to coaxing three furlongs out, continued four
wide for home and tired. INVEST got bumped at the start by STRONG ONE due to pressure from INTERNET OF THINGS and was taken in hand when
squeezed mildly out, chased four to five paths off the inside until put to coaxing and darted to the inside near the half mile pole, chased just off the inside
through the turn coaxed along, continued from the two path into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
PUBLIC SECTOR (GB) exchanged bumps with a rival at the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled comfortably on his own while in the back half
of the field, was roused with three furlongs to run, went three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied outside under a strong hand ride,
closed fast to get the lead inside the furlong marker, kicked clear as the rider looked behind him and opted against using the whip into the final sixteenth and
proved much the best under a hand ride to the wire. SCARLETT SKY was rated on the inside, came off the rail midway through the far turn, was asked at
the five-sixteenths, shifted three wide outside the quarter-pole, chased behind foes into upper stretch, dropped in for room into the final furlong and finished
with good courage to just get the place. JIMMY P hesitated at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a bit over two lengths, moved in at the rear, saved
ground on the first turn, moved out of last under urging at the five-eighths, was ridden along against the rail on the final turn, angled out in upper stretch and
also finished with good courage but just missed the place while able to get the show. SEIZING THE DREAM was hustled from the outside post, moved in
while showing speed, raced in the two to three path on the first turn, disputed the pace on the outside, vied between horses in the two path on the far turn,
was asked at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under the whip, battled between foes under a drive into the final furlong, lost the lead shortly
thereafter and weakened. POLINESIA was taken under tight restraint early, became rank under a vigorous hold in the three path on the first turn, was rated
just off the pace, came under urging while three wide for most of the far turn then moved to four wide outside the quarter-pole, was driven into upper stretch,
chased into the final furlong, came between horses into the final sixteenth and lacked the needed kick. ROCK SUGAR showed early speed, contested the
pace on the inside, was asked while inside of two foes at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, battled into the final furlong and gave
way. RIP IT was keen under restraint in the four path on the first turn, pulled his way forward under tight restraint early on the backstretch, prompted outside
under a snug hold, drew even with the leaders in the three path on the final turn, was given his cue around the five-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the
final furlong and tired. DREAMING OF GERRY exchanged bumps with an opponent at the start, went two to three wide under tight restraint on the first turn,
was rated under a hold, came under urging late on the backstretch, went four wide for most of the far turn then was carried five wide while dropping back
outside the quarter-pole and capitulated. THE KUKRI went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the back, was urged along in the two path on
the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and was no factor.

Footnotes
LUSITANO got put to an abbreviated ride after stumbling badly at the break, remained stationed along the inside route in pursuit of the front runners, was
switched over to a drive coming up to the five-sixteenths pole, angled out four wide into the stretch for the best of racing room, began to chip away at the
deficit as the run leading up to and then through the furlong grounds was being completed, maintained the momentum springing from the eighth pole as
CHATEAU was alternating between the rail and path two, reacting to whichever side the whip was being applied, rolled by with confidence in the final
seventy yards. CHATEAU established the top in short order, sailed along on an open lead from just off the rail, drew out to lead by his largest margin as the
half was being reeled off, got cued up in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, wandered back and forth between the rail and two path during the
ensuing sixteenth shying whenever stick work was being utilized, proved powerless getting overhauled in the final stages, had enough left though to salvage
second. MAD MUNNYS stepped onto the turn from path three, was still there exiting it, mustered up a mild response to grab the show award. REED KAN
travelled two to three wide on the turn, was more the former entering the stretch, inched up, missed third. SKYLER'S SCRAMJET took up position in
midpack on the backstretch, departed it from path two, came under stronger handling by the five-sixteenths marker, commenced the stretch one path farther
off the rail, lacked the necessary response. HAWAIIAN NOISES sent over to the rail at the half mile pole, cut the corner driving, was never heard from.
BITUMEN three wide at the top of the turn, was spotted in path four at the top of the lane, failed to contend.

Footnotes
FARRAGUT bobbled at the start and came under hustling establishing the front to show the way in hand just off the inside through swift splits, tucked inside
through the turn and came under pressure from a pair responding under an off sided stick placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper
stretch, dug in under challenge and was headed a furlong out, fought on inside a pair coming again to take command seventy yards from home, then held
on from a late surging rival. SARATOGA PAL bobbled at the start recovering outwards into AMERICAN PIPER, chased three to four wide briefly before
tucking to the two path near the half mile pole, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung two to three wide for home, got on track inside the
eighth pole and kicked on belatedly surging late on a trio of embattled rivals to just get up for the place honors in the very last jump to the wire. PAPA LUKE
broke out at the start bumping QUICK RETURN, raced four wide in closest aim of the leader before tucking to the two path and advancing on that rival in
tandem with QUICK RETURN to his outside, prompted the front between foes from the midway point on the bend, spun just off the inside for home set down
for the drive, dug in under a drive between foes and took over narrow command a furlong from home, got collared with seventy yards from the finish when
weakening in the late stages. QUICK RETURN bumped at the start by PAPA LUKE who broke outwards, chased five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide and advanced through the turn to pressure the top pair through the bend coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun
three wide for home, dug in latched on the top pair through the stretch and could not go by, then weakened in the late going. ECCOCI QUA five to six paths
off the inside down the backstretch, chased three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went five wide into upper stretch and offered
no response. AMERICAN PIPER bumped at the start by SARATOGA PAL who recovered outwards from a bobble, chased six paths off the inside down the
backstretch before angling to the inside into the turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths and came under an off sided stick, cut the corner into upper
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
FEVOLA brushed with a rival at the start then was hustled, showed speed then stalked the leading duo on the outside, engaged those foes in the four path
on the turn, moved clear at the quarter-pole, responded well when put to a left-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths, continued under the whip until just
inside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed while put under a hand ride from that point to the wire. NO LIME brushed with a foe at the start, bumped with
LARCENY leaving the chute, settled off the pace, was urged along while moving from the inside to the two path early on the turn, shifted three wide under a
drive late on that bend, swung five wide into the stretch under a left-handed whip, gained on the outside, drifted in outside the furlong marker, was guided
out under continued left-hand urging outside the sixteenth-pole, lugged in behind the winner late and was held together to the wire while well clear for the
place. LARCENY bumped with NO LIME leaving the chute, moved up to contest the pace on the inside, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back under
a drive in upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. BEACH FRONT lost his footing at the start, raced well back on the outside, was urged
along while dropping from three to two wide on the turn, came out some under a drive into upper stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and lacked
the needed response. BRAZEN was corrected with a tug of the left rein at the start, angled in while showing good speed, contested the pace on the outside
of a foe, vied in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and faded. MANDATORY PAYOUT
bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, settled well back in the field, was urged along in the two path on the turn and was no factor.
ONESHOTATFOREVER settled off the early pace, came under urging with five furlongs to run, went three to four wide on the turn and retreated. IT'S A
RISK bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was urged along while moving from three to five wide on the turn and failed to respond. RIDOLFO
was urged along on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, went four then three wide on the turn and faltered. ZELENKA bobbled while losing
his footing at the start, angled in near the five-eighths, saved ground on the turn and showed little. KING OF AMERICAN acted-up just as the gate opened,
had the jock step off into the side pontoon and came out riderless then was eventually walked off after being caught by an outrider. Following a stewards'
inquiry into the start, no change was made.

Footnotes
CALIBRATE hand urged after springing from the starting,gained a narrow lead after the first panel had been rattled off, got guided over to the inside route,
led the way by a slim margin, facing pressure from a pair of opponents positioned in paths two and three respectively, ventured onward under the same
set-up for the opening half, got set down spinning into the stretch, with the runner up having arrived boldly on the scene at that juncture, dug in with good
determination to fend off all comers, left the eighth pole finally freed of any outside pressure, kicked away smartly displaying good energy. ENGRAVE turned
sideways after making contact with OFFICIATING in the shadow of the starting gate, took the aforementioned foe for an abbreviated ride before settling into
stride, inched his way to the outside approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, was mainly in the four path in pursuit of the front runners, flashed
interest when switched over to a brisk hand ride leaving the five-sixteenths pole, challenged as the widest of four front runners on fairly even terms with
others stepping onto the head of the stretch, got staved off by the winner during the next furlong, saw the top one draw off afterwards, stayed on to secure
second. UNITEDANDRESOLUTE cut over in the two path by the top of the backstretch, vied from between rivals from the five and a half to midlane,
weakened in the final furlong, saved the show. RESTORED ORDER the early leader, got headed by the winner shortly after entering the backstretch, took
up residence in the three path, vied as the widest of three all the way to the end of the bend, was turned loose for the drive, kept up its pursuit in earnest for
a few additional jumps before backing away. SWILL clipped from behind by OFFICIATING shortly after the start, made it over to the rail after recovering
from the incident, tracked the pace from midpack, got cued up for the drive, was worked into path four, attaining the goal by the furlong marker, made no
impact. DONEGAL BAY strung out three wide on the turn, lacked the necessary stretch response. OFFICIATING came in slightly at the start, made solid
contact with the second place finisher before getting forced towards SWILL afterwards, stumbled after clipping the heels of the last-named opponent, saw
the pilot resort to a light hand ride, moved over to the inside, loped along far behind the others teamed up with SOUTHERN PASSAGE, bobbled coming up
to the half mile pole, raced along the inside route during the run around the bend, was under a firm hold swinging about three wide into the stretch,
responded with gusto when switched over to a brisk hand ride in midstretch, made much headway, then catching many an eye while doing so, won the
gallop out basically under his own power. HIGH KNUCKLES guided onto the rail at the half mile pole, tipped out two wide for the drive, had no offering.
SOUTHERN PASSAGE shied leftward in an awkward manner, was then one-paced two until the head of the stretch without ever having made its presence
felt. INDOCTRINATE took up the chase two wide on the turn, gave way.

Footnotes
MO READY tracked the pace along the inside through the first turn before tipping to the two path down the backstretch leading the main flight in behind a
spurting away leader, remained patiently handled into the far turn and took closer order on the front through the bend coming under coaxing nearing the
quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to duel with DANFUSI through the stretch taking narrow command a sixteenth out, then
inched away to the finish kept to task. DANFUSI established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, then spurted away once down the
backstretch to a commanding lead while only picking up the pace slightly, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole as the field took closer order, spun
just off the inside for home, dug in under lone threat and knocked heads from the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker when displaced narrowly from
command, then got shaken off in the late stages while along second best when clear for the place honors. ALBIE tracked the pace along the inside from mid
pack early on, advanced to be just off the pace into the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, bid swinging just off the inside into upper stretch
and kept on to secure the show honors. JIMMY JAZZ stumbled at the start, raced just off the inside into the first turn before wandering three to four wide
midway on that bend, chased three wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide for home and weakened
in the late stages. STEELERSFANFORLIFE two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. SIMPLY tracked the pace just off the inside, tucked inside at the three-eighths, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to go, cut the corner into
upper stretch and offered no response. KID D'ORO three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide from near the rear, got coaxed along at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. BOURBON BAY just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, got taken hold of and
steadied just off the inside three furlongs from home into the far turn, came under coaxing along the inside at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside
into upper stretch and weakened. OUR TROUBADOUR had his head cocked to the near side wrestling with the assistant starter when the latch was sprung,
hit the near side stall at the start getting away to a tangled beginning and conceded five to six lengths to the front, raced just off the inside through the
opening bend at the tail of the field, tipped three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch
and offered no response. JO'S BOLD CAT lunged at the break, raced two then three wide through the first turn, chased three then four wide from near the
rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start
focusing on OUR TROUBADOUR. After review, OUR TROUBADOUR was declared a non starter.

wide into the stretch, moved out behind horses under a left-handed whip around the furlong marker, shifted further out while gaining in the vicinity of the

while able to get the place. NO WORD was taken under tight restraint early, raced between horses in the two path through the first turn, was rated off the
pace, saved ground on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, chased along the hedge into the final furlong, made a bid near the sixteenth-pole
and missed while just able to get the show. COLONEL LIAM was restless in the gate, bumped hard with rivals at the start then was pinched back, went

taken in hand early then tucked into the two path entering the first turn, was rated off the pace, came under urging while three wide on the far turn, chased
under the whip in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. GET SMOKIN had his head turned at the start then leapt in the air and was off a couple of lengths

inside to the two path on the far turn, came under a right-handed whip in upper stretch, led into the final furlong then was headed, dropped back into the final

Footnotes
SWISS SKYDIVER kept abreast of CRYSTAL BALL as the twosome made their way towards the clubhouse bend, was firmly held accompanying that
opponent two to three wide, moved when ready at the midway point of the far turn, wresting away the advantage even with the nemesis having been asked
for more run by this juncture, extended the margin unasked the remainder of the way to the quarter pole, arrived at the three-sixteenths pole and saw the
rider switch over to stronger handling, best described as being ridden out, opened up a commanding lead by the beginning of the final furlong, was still in
possession of a healthy one prior to being wrapped up for the final seventy yards. BONNY SOUTH put to a snug hold after springing from the gate, glided
over to the rail, contently tracked the pace towards the back of the pack, was asked to pick up interest angling to the outside at the quarter pole, completed
the maneuver approximately three wide, overhauled HARVEY'S LIL GOIL, then cut into the deficit late on the geared down winner. HARVEY'S LIL GOIL
recovered in short order after stumbling at the start, chased the pace three wide, scurried into contention with a sustained run around the second bend,
turned into the lane, couldn't keep pace with the top one over the course of the next furlong, flattened out late and lost out on place honors. ENVOUTANTE
took up residence in the pocket after the field had been sent on its way, was rated along staying within striking distance of the front runners, idled behind the
weakening former pacesetter during the final stages of the run around the far turn, slipped to the outside in time to get sterred four wide into the stretch, got
outfinished. CRYSTAL BALL under some encouragement establishing the top, was just off the rail showing the way, pressed by the confidently-ridden
SWISS SKYDIVER to her outside, came under a ride after departing the backstretch, got swallowed up nonetheless about a furlong later, stepped into the
lane and backed away. SPICE IS NICE remained in path two after the start, was between rivals until the general area of the three-eighths pole, required
some hand urging to keep pace travelling on the backstretch, was then more feverishly ridden after stepping onto turn two, fell back, was allowed to fade
away in the final furlong. FIRE CORAL strung out three wide, was under some urging by midway on the backstretch, retreated after leaving the half mile
pole, was put to milder urging by midstretch and allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
NEW YORK'S FINEST bobbled at the break and broke on top despite it coming under hustling to briefly tussle with CALL ME HARRY before taking sole
command tucking to the two path safely in front of that rival, remained patiently handled until nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home
roused for the drive, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. MAXWELL ESQUIRE got off to an awkward start and
conceded two lengths to the front, tracked the pace just off the inside from the tail of the field, tucked inside at the five-sixteenths, angled out three wide into
upper stretch, got paused briefly in behind ROYAL ASSET straightened away and altered to the two path under coaxing at the three-sixteenths, got paused
once more off the heels of SHIRAZ while next to CALL ME HARRY and altered inside skimming the hedge a furlong out before bursting through a seam to
rally with late energy along the inside latching on the aforementioned foe as that rival hit the finish. SHIRAZ coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside
from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors by a bob of the head
on the wire. BUSTIN SHOUT three to four wide in pursuit, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild bid. CALL ME HARRY coaxed from the gate, couldn't out hustle the eventual winner and conceded the front to chase two then three wide
in closest aim, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, weakened in the late stages. ROYAL ASSET broke in at the start
bumping QIAN B C in tandem with VALMONT and pinched that foe back, chased three then two wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide
into upper stretch and offered no response. VALMONT broke out at the start bumping and pinching back QIAN B C in concert with ROYAL ASSET, chased
three wide coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no headway. QIAN B C broke in brushing the near side stall,
then got bumped and pinched back between foes who each broke his way and was forced to be briefly taken in hand conceding two to three lengths to the
front, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along near the quarter pole, angled five wide at the head
of the stretch and offered no kick.

moved up to make a bid with five furlongs to run, took the lead outside the half-mile pole, vied inside on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole,
came under a left-handed whip in upper stretch, battled into the final furlong and gave way. GOLCONDA bumped with a rival at the start then dropped back,
brushed with a foe into the first turn, went four wide on that bend, settled at the rear, moved in near the half-mile pole, saved ground while roused on the far
turn, swung three wide into the stretch under the whip and failed to rally. PERFECT BANKER went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the
pace under a hold, lost the lead outside the half-mile pole then dropped back a bit, steadied strongly from the three-eighths to the five-sixteenths, saved
ground into the stretch and came up empty.
