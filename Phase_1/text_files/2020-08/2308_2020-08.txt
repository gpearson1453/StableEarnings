Footnotes
AFLEET DIVA set a pressured pace, moved clear at the quarter pole, powered away under right and left-handed urging and coasted in late. TAKE HER
TEMP stalked off the rail, angled in on the turn, saved ground into the lane, produced a mild rally along the fence and bested the rest. BEST LADY off slow
and broke in, trailed the field from the inside, came out leaving the bend and edged rival for third. VANNA stalked the pace in the early going, angled five
wide leaving the bend, brushed by PRETTY SAYLEE past the eighth pole and got edged for the show. GRIGORO veered out leaving the gate, chased off
the inside, came four wide into the stretch and never threatened. WARREN'S MEMORABLE had early speed from the inside, chased the leader into the
turn, was hard to ride throwing her head through the bend, angled out in the stretch and lacked further response. SMOOTH RITHMS stumbled at the start
but recovered quickly to press the pace outside the leader then between foes on the turn, chased two to three wide into the stretch and weakened. PRETTY
SAYLEE up close outside a pair of rivals, chased four wide into the lane, lugged out and brushed VANNA inside the eighth pole and tired.

Footnotes
HEYWOODS BEACH tucked inside stalking the pace, saved ground into the stretch, tipped out, surged outside the leader and nailed TRIPOLI at the wire.
TRIPOLI took command from the inside and controlled the pace, showed the way into the stretch, led through the drive and was caught on the line.
EKKLESIA contested the pace early then stalked outside TRIPOLI, chased between runners into the stretch and kept on willingly to hold the show.
MECKLENBURG (IRE) off slow to begin, pulled early to the nine-sixteenths then again past the half-mile marker, angled out into the stretch and finished
willingly. EASTERN OCEAN up close between rivals early then dropped back into stalking position, entered the stretch three deep and flattened. RACE
HOME lost footing and off a bit slow to begin, went three wide into the first turn, settled off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and had little left for the
drive. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
EASY GRADER stalked outside a rival, angled out into and upper stretch, closed and edged rival in time under a drive. COME ON KAT pressed the pace
outside, three deep on the turn, closed in and took over at the sixteenth pole but was edged at the wire. COALINGA HILLS in range from the outside,
chased four wide into the lane, closed from the outside but could not match the top pair. MAMA'S KID in range of the speed early, snuck through from the
inside and gained command on the turn, vied with a pair of rivals around the bend, moved clear at the three-sixteenths, fought back when challenged in the
drive but yielded in the late stages. WINSINFASHION settled inside, saved ground into the lane, lacked room and checked mid-stretch and kept on to the
wire. SPEEDY GIGI set the pace off the inside while under pressure, lost the lead and vied between foes around the bend, lost contact with the leader into
the stretch and weakened. INCREDIBLY LUCKY tracked five wide through the turn and was always outrun. MIZ TIANJIN stumbled leaving the gate, trailed
three wide into the lane and was never a factor. THE STEWARDS RULED THAT WINSINFASHION TRIED TO MOVE THROUGH THE INSIDE WITHOUT
SUFFICIENT CLEARANCE AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
SUPER GAME sped clear take control, dictated the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, inched away in upper stretch and held well
under right-handed encouragement. MISS EVER READY stalked outside a rival, three wide into the drive, finished well and edged WARRENS CANDY
GIRL for the place honors. WARRENS CANDY GIRL mid-pack in the early going while outside a rival, moved out four wide, rallied outside MISS EVER
READY and was outkicked for second. PAWNEE off a bit slow at the start, traveled near the back of the pack, angled out on the second turn and exited the
final turn three wide, summoned a mild rally and attained a minor award. LUXURY LINER stalked the leader a bit off the rail to the stretch and flattened in
the drive. COMPLETE CONTROL went three wide into the first turn then angled in around that bend, saved ground off the pace, split foes in the lane and
improved position. WHERE'S FRANKIE fractious in the gate, traveled mid-pack inside a rival, raced two wide then moved into the three path in the lane and
lacked a response to urging. BIG DRESS tracked inside and weakened in the drive. BIG MOON off slow leaving the gate, saved ground into the lane and
was always outrun. HAND TIMED.

CLAIM OF PASSION stalked along the fence, angled three wide leaving the second turn, rallied under right then left-handed encouragement and inhaled
ANTITHETITCAL to prove best. ANTITHETICAL broke in and bumped rival, went to the front and set a pressure pace, shook free approaching the turn, led
through the drive but could not stave off the winner. ROOKIE MISTAKE settled off the inside, steadied briefly at the three-quarter marker, traveled three
deep on the backstretch, came four to five wide into the lane and gained the show. TEJON pressed outside and faltered in the lane. HANDSOME CAT four
wide around the first turn, chased four deep on the backstretch, moved out and came six wide into the lane and weakened. KING EDDIE bumped leaving
the gate, chased between on the first turn then tugged his way near the front three deep, lost ground around the far turn and chased four wide into the lane
and tired. WILD BEAN stumbled badly at the start, angled in early, steadied off heels at the three-quarter pole, angled out on the second turn, exited that
bend three wide and had little left for the drive. NO NAME FRED traveled outside a rival, pulled early, chased between to the far turn then raced a bit off the
rail, eased in the stretch and across the wire having bled and walked off following the race.

HAMMERING LEMON sped to the front and took control of the rail, showed the way clear into the stretch, put to a drive at the eighth pole and held off the
runner-up. TROPICAL TERROR unhurried in the early stages, moved forward to mid-pack on the backstretch, raced three wide into the stretch, took aim at
the leader, surged late and just missed. TABLE FOR TEN stalked inside, cut the corner into the stretch, chased inside through the lane and held the show.
CARMELITA'S MAN settled off the rail, moved into the two path on the first turn, steered toward the inside, saved ground into the stretch, moved off the rail
and finished willingly. LUVLUV fractious in the gate, stalked outside a rival then off the rail, exited final turn three wide, showed a mild response but needed
to find more in deep stretch. GAMBINI trailed early, advanced up the backstretch, came four wide into the lane and flattened. KALINE tracked inside, off the
rail into the far turn, three wide entering the drive, angled out and lacked a rally. COUNT ALEXEI fractious in the gate, bumped at the start while off alertly,
raced up close while three wide and outside a rival, went three deep into the far turn, two wide into the lane and weakened. ME MACHO forwardly placed a
bit off the rail, chased between runners into the far turn, angled out but lacked room and steadied in upper stretch and faded after. KINGOFJESTERS
fractious in the gate, broke in and bumped rival, raced near the inside, two wide into the stretch and never made an impact. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SHEZA GIRLY GIRL chased three wide into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, angled outside the leader in the stretch, ranged up and
gained command past the eighth pole and drove clear. MISS FRAULEIN had good early speed and set the pace in the two path, inched away around the
turn, challenged from the outside approaching the furlong marker, lost command shortly after and held the place. MORNING ADDICTION in range early
while outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch, brushed with WITH THIS VOW at the eighth pole and held the show. WITH THIS VOW tracked five
wide into the turn, four wide leaving the bend, brushed with MORNING ADDICTION near the eighth pole and lacked a bid. TROUVILLE lacked early speed,
chased inside then moved out to enter the stretch three wide and failed to rally. MUCHO MACHO WOMAN chased in the two path then a bit off the rail into
the drive and tired. MALIBU CAT off the pace in the early going, two wide into the turn, came out and left the turn five wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
DO NOT SWIPE LEFT set the pace with pressure to the inside then dueled with JACK COOL for command, cleared rival past the three-eighths and showed
the way into the stretch, responded when challenged through the final furlong and gamely prevailed. LEPRINO stalked the pace to the turn, took aim four
wide into the stretch, ranged up alongside DO NOT SWIPE LEFT with a sixteenth to go but could not find the final punch to get by. NEXT REVOLT stalked
the top pair up the backstretch from off the rail, raced five wide around the turn, showed a mild response in the drive and while unable to make an impact on
the top pair finished a clear third. PRINCE RICKY well placed just off the speed in the early going, went three to four wide around the turn and weakened in
the lane. AMMOLITE broke in, drifted out early and was corrected quickly, continued to race a bit green up the backstretch, angled four wide then got
steered out further in upper stretch and kept on willingly. BIGFOOT CITY mid-pack early, went four wide into the lane and never rallied. FOUR O'FIVE
angled to the inside early, saved ground around the turn, lacked room behind rivals and angled out at the eighth pole then improved position in the late
stages. QAABIL bumped twice at the start, raced between foes then outside a rival, traveled three then four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. JAY
BOY forced in by rival leaving the gate, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch and was always outrun. JACK COOL pressed the pace early then moved up to
duel for command, dropped back on the turn and tired in the stretch. HUNGARIAN STORM tracked two wide around the turn and weakened. VEINSTRIKE
broke in and bumped with rival twice leaving the gate, eased around the turn and into the stretch, eventually crossed the wire and walked off.
