LOOK OUT JAYCE Tracked along the two path, challenged at the furlong marker, battled and drove clear. UNION BANKS Hopped at the start, rushed up
the backstretch along the two path, drifted out at the three-eighths pole carrying BE LIKE BOSTON four wide, took the three path into the lane and outran
the latter for the place. BE LIKE BOSTON Ducked out at the start bumping with CROSSEYED CAT, was forced four wide into the turn by UNION BANKS,
lodged a bid outside and finished with interest. J'S WARRIOR Broke sharply, set the pace off the rail, was hooked and faded. LEGION STORM Unhurried
along the rail and failed to threaten. BUC'S INVESTMINT Well placed, was forced wide by UNION BANKS into the turn, checked, five wide into the lane and
weakened. CROSSEYED CAT Jostled at the start, three path on the turn, was not a factor. AIR QUALITY Jostled at the start, saved ground on the turn, was
outrun.
