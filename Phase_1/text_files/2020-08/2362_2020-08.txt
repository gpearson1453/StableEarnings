Footnotes
KING OF THE COURT broke readily, disputed the pace between foes on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, turned back the challenge of TAPIZARS
SECRET nearing upper stretch, then continued with a sustained effort to just edge KELLER'S GOLD in the closing stages under firm right handed
encouragement.. The latter was guided to the rail while being urged to terms with the pacesetter prompting the pace, pressed the issue into upper stretch to
strike the front between calls but proved only second best. TAPIZARS SECRET gained terms attending the pace three deep racing through the backstretch,
pressed the issue through the turn but weakened racing into the lane. CAVE RUN tracked off the first flight along the inside, shifted out racing into the lane
but offered no rally. ROCKNROLL ROCKET tracked off the first flight from out of striking distance outside a rival racing to the turn and had no rally.

Footnotes
SILVER MAKER hopped at the start, quickly recovered to track just off the first flight along the inside while pulling a bit racing into the backstretch, conceded
some ground to the leaders continuing under patient handling while switching out nearing the far turn, gradually drew into striking distance racing into upper
stretch, shifted four wide nearing the furlong marker gathering momentum and wrested the advantage from MISCHIEVOUS MO in time while shifting
inwards under right handed pressure making light contact nearing the wire. The latter gained a forward placing three deep stalking just off the leaders under
light rating in the opening half, was urged to press the issue in that path on the far turn, edged forward to gain a clear advantage racing into upper stretch,
but was collared nearing the wire while exchanging some light contact. ROCKTHEPULPIT broke outwards bumping LITTLE INSTIGATOR, was quickly
righted, then urged along the inside disputing the pace inside a rival into the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes through the far turn and gave way
in the drive. SEMI CHARMED DAY, urged between foes forcing the pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue through the far turn and gave way into
upper stretch. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY broke inwards bumping LITTLE INSTIGATOR, was collected to track off the second flight off the inside racing to the
backstretch but offered no rally. LITTLE INSTIGATOR, bumped, then squeezed between rivals at the start, settled last while shifting to the outside racing to
the backstretch and never menaced thereafter.

Footnotes
ABOVE BOARD broke readily, sped to the lead while shifting to the three path racing into the backstretch, widened his advantage after a half, held sway on
a comfortable advantage through the far turn remaining well off the rail and was kept to pressure to prove clearly best. BOXER BOY was rated along the
inside tracking off the first flight in early stages, switched outside foes entering the backstretch, then gradually drew into contention in the closing stages
while angling four wide midstretch to just edge a rival for the place honors on the wire. SPIRIT MISSION, forwardly placed three deep racing to the first turn,
was eased off the leaders to track between foes from well out of striking distance to the far turn, angled in nearing the lane to gain position just off the inside
in late stages and just missed for second. CABIN JOHN, in touch prompting the pacesetter into the first turn, lost some ground to that foe racing into the
backstretch, continued in pursuit to upper stretch but emptied out late. BLUE JEANS N BEER broke slowly, was held up while shifting out early and never
gained contention. OH BROTHER JACK was a brief factor four wide pursuing the leaders through the first turn but emptied out early.

Footnotes
LILA'S LUCKY LADY broke readily, took up a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter between rivals under light rating to the backstretch, pressed
the issue on the far turn, took over racing into upper stretch and kicked clear under energetic handling. COME ON SWEET PEA angled in tracking off the
first flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting out three wide racing into the far turn, was roused to close the gap on the winner
entering the lane but proved only second best. ROSIE'S FLOWER'S, urged to the lead outside foes racing into the first turn, angled inside once gaining the
advantage entering the backstretch while pulling against firm rating, dictated the pace in hand for a half, was prompted to resist the eventual winner's bid
racing through the far turn and gave way into the lane. HELEN'SPHOTOFLASH settled along the inside in early stages, saved ground to the lane and
passed only tiring rivals. TRENDY NEVE, unprepared for the start, broke slowly, was urged to a contending position three deep racing to the backstretch
and emptied out racing into the far turn. DUSTY PRINCESS settled last to the backstretch and failed to menace.

I'M AN EIGHT, reluctant to load, broke sharply, was urged to the lead while angling inside racing into the first turn to dictate the pace on a narrow
advantage, turned back the challenge of CANDY WOMPUS racing through the far turn and shook clear in the lane under steady pressure. The latter broke
outwards making light contact with NORTHERN BRILLIANCE, was prompted to a forward placing attending a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, pressed
the issue on the far turn to upper stretch, shifted out entering the lane and couldn't match the winner late. IRISH MAJOR tracked the leaders inside foes in
second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out entering the far turn while being prompted to advance and edged a rival for a share in late stages. KELA
BREW tracked the pace between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to make brief progress three deep nearing the far turn,
angled inwards while losing ground to the top pair and faded in the drive. NORCO settled last in early stages and passed only tiring rivals. BORN FORCE,
caught four wide racing into the first turn tracking just off the second flight, offered no rally. NORTHERNBRILLIANCE, bumped, then shuffled back out of
close quarters at the start, shifted out three wide racing into the first turn while prompted to a position just off the second flight, gave way early.

Footnotes
SUMMER REVOLUTION broke readily to gain terms with the leaders three deep prompting the pace, pressed the issue outside a rival racing into the turn,
edged forward leaving the midway point of the bend and steadily widened his advantage to prove best under hand urging. GUSKA MON SHOES, urged
between foes pressing the pace into the turn, proved no match after a half but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. BIG SPORT tracked off
the first flight while angling to the inside, saved ground to the lane but had no closing bid while edging a rival for a share. CREATIVE ART broke slowly,
switched off the inside in early stages to make brief progress between, angled four wide into the lane and flattened out late. MINES MADE UP, urged to
dispute the pace inside foes from the outset, gave way into the turn. TENTWELVEFOURTEEN tracked the leaders five wide in early stages and steadily
faded into the turn. WATER PATROL, reserved last in the opening stages, trailed the field to the lane.

Footnotes
PLANE TALK broke readily, was hustled to gain the advantage racing a bit off the rail, went clear into the turn while shifting to the three path and widened
the advantage under pressure. DEFLATER hopped at the start, was urged along the inside pursuing the leaders into the turn, shifted off the inside racing
into the lane and prevailed for the place honors in the closing stages. RUN AWAY BETT settled between foes in the second flight, dropped out last on the
backstretch, saved ground on the turn to the lane and continued well enough inside foes to gain a share. GEAUXCRO broke sharply, prompted the pace
three wide through the backstretch into the turn and gave way into the lane. MISTER NOT FUNNY tracked off the first flight four wide racing into the turn
and steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
BLAME BISHOP was urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, forged clear into the far turn,
drifted while going a bit erratically in the closing stages but proved clearly best under pressure. GONE CRUISING tracked off the first flight inside rivals to
the backstretch, shifted out to split foes just off the racing into the lane and bested the others. GOTTA LIL CAPTAIN tracked off the first flight three wide
between foes, shifted four wide racing into the lane and improved position. RUN AWAY FLASH switched out five wide racing through the first turn,
continued widest to the lane and had no rally. YOU GOT THE LOOK angled inwards while being urged between foes prompting the pace in the opening
half, gave way on the far turn. PURPLE MONSTER, forwardly placed three wide stalking the pacesetter, couldn't close ground on the leader on the far turn,
bobbled nearing midstretch and was gathered up late. CLARK AND ADDISON, caught wide early, proved no threat. DIRECT IMPACT raced four wide
between foes to the backstretch and faded early.
