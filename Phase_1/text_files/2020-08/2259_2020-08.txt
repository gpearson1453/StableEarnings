Footnotes
METADATA dwelt briefly giving his rival a four length head start, closed to mid pack, circled four and five-wide on the far turn, had command at the top of
the stretch and held sway under a hand ride. BREAD CRUMBS raced in mid pack, closed three and four-wide on the far turn and finished with a determined
drive. JORDANS WAY settled in mid pack, chased angling from the rail to four-wide late turn, tipped out further at the top of the stretch then finished
willingly. I HAVE HOPE stalked the pace, bid late turn, led briefly but was headed by METADATA at the top of the stretch but lacked a closing response. TIZ
TAP TANGO settled off the pace, enjoyed a rail trip, was hustled late backstretch and turn but was never in contention. MARITIME MAGIC led quickly, drew
off a bit and set a reserved pace, was headed late turn and tired. PEACE OUT MAN settled in mid pack, chased four and five-wide on the far turn but lacked
a closing response. MIJO raced in mid pack, was hustled on the backstretch, came two and three-wide through the far turn then flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
CAROLINA GRACE stalked the pacesetters, closed up and forced the issue moving from the rail to the second path late turn, challenged just into the final
furlong and prevailed under a drive. FINEST JEWEL stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn then finished all out in the stretch and
was gaining late. STORMY VISION, bumped at the start, dueled two-wide, was headed at the top of the stretch, rebid a furlong out but was outkicked.
VINYASA raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. BENEVIDA stalked the pace, closed into the far
turn, forced the pace then was all out through the stretch. TWICK was pinched back at the start and settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn
then closed gamely between horses. SARARENDA dueled from the rail, stole the lead at the top of the stretch, was headed in the final furlong and gave
way. CLEARLY SEEN bobbled at the start and bumped STORMY VISION, rode the rail throughout and finished gamely in vain. DANCE ALONG DEDE
broke outward and settled off the pace, closed from the rail to three-wide on the far turn then evened out in the late stages.

Footnotes
NATIVE PRINCE took back after unable to get the lead into the first turn, settled nicely along the rail behind the two pacesetters, angled out at the quarter
pole to blew past the leader at the three sixteenths, had a clear lead and held safe despite a diminishing margin late. MEYER off the pace early, followed the
winner up the rail on the far turn, came off the rail turning for home to get by a faltering speedster, then ducked back inside the winner in late stretch but
couldn't get closer in the final strides, second best. LION'S GOLDENHEART off the pace early, waited for room on hold around the far turn, came inside in
upper stretch before shifting out to the five path by the sixteenth pole and proceeded to close well late for the show. SELF INFLICTED off the pace early and
two to three wide on the turns, trailed midway on the far turn and finally got into high gear in the final seventy yards, closing as well as the show horse with
good energy late. MATINEE was off the pace and four to two wide around the first turn, circled up three to four wide on the far turn, fanned into the five path
turning for home and was still closing on end, but not as briskly as earlier. FREE SPEECH sprinted clear early, shook off a pace challenger by midway on
the far turn, was collared by the turn for home and retreated in the final furlong. LAKESIDE PARK broke a step slow and settled in mid pack while four to two
wide around the first turn, moved up menacingly late on the far turn but had no response down the lane, faltering in the final furlong. HARD N'SWEET broke
sluggishly before rushing up three wide to challenge into the first turn, stalked and pressed the front runner until midway on the far turn, backing through the
field from that point.

gained control, was all out to hold but failed to stave off the winner. HELLO FRIENDS bumped with ROLLING SLOAN leaving the gate, stalked the pace
three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the late stages. GLAMOUROUS GIRL, in range, chased three-wide late turn then
finished under a determined drive. SEAMIALAUGH stalked the pace,raced two and three-wide on the turn, reached for the lead a furlong out but failed to
get up and evened out. OHEAVENS moved up to lead on the backstretch, set a pressured pace, shook clear upper stretch but was headed mid stretch and
evened out. ELEANOR POWELL broke outward and settled off the pace, closed angling inward from three-wide to the rail on the turn, launched an all out
drive and showed a good late effort. HASN'T HIT ME YET broke sideways and settled off the pace, closed two to four-wide gaining mid pack on the turn,
finished widest and failed to menace. CLASSY MISTRESS raced from off the pace, came two to four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but did
not threaten. QUEEN LICIA stalked the pace, came four and five-wide through the turn then tired in the stretch. ALITTLEIRISHLUCK, in mid pack early,
