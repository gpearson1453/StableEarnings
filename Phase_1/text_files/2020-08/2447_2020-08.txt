Footnotes
BUSTER DOUGLAS (BRZ) had good speed, dueled inside of ROMAN RUSH and off the rail to the stretch then pushed clear to mid stretch and held driving.
CATS BLAME chased the leaders two wide to the stretch then finished well without threatening the winner. ROMAN RUSH hustled to duel outside the
winner and three wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch then could not save the place. STRETCH RUN had no speed, raced two then three wide
to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. MY LUCKY MARK chased the leaders from the rail to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong.
CANADA refused to break, was walked out and unmounted. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race but determined that CANADA was
given a fair start and no change was warranted.

ILLAPAWNIE stalked the leaders to the turn then inherited the lead while saving ground to the stretch, responded when set down and held under strong
urging. SUGAR CRUSH trailed to the turn, was three wide then swung out for room into the stretch and finished in a rally to get second. LYRICALLY
VIOLENT chased the pace from the rail to the stretch, loomed a threat leaving mid stretch but was outfinished. SWANEE lugged out while showing speed
and brushed with DARLING DEMON, continued to lug out and forced DARLING DEMON out to the seven path into the stretch then finally straightened but
lacked a closing response. SURELY A SMILE was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then could not make an impact in the drive.
DARLING DEMON was outside of SWANEE and brushed by that one nearing the turn then was forced out to the seven path by SWANEE into the stretch
and weakened.

COASTAL STARLITE was outsprinted to the turn, came two wide to the stretch then shifted out for room, rallied when set down, took the lead in deep
stretch then held off a rival late. JENPIRESTRIKESBACK had no speed, saved ground to the stretch then finished in rally along the rail.
GALWALKSINTOABAR stalked the pace to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch then was outfinished.
REMEMBER TO SMILE had no speed, was four wide into the turn but drifted out six wide into the stretch and was not a threat. HAMMY TIME got
outsprinted also to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. SIMPLY PERFECT hustled to contest the pace two wide to the
stretch then weakened. CIRCULODEGANADORAS was outside of SIMPLY PERFECT while battling that one three wide to the stretch then gave way.

LOVE OF ART (IRE) pressed the pace to the half mile pole, moved alongside the favorite on the second turn then inched away to mid stretch and held on
stubbornly. LEONILLA stalked the leaders to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then finished willingly but too late. MISS INDEFATIGABLE set the
pace for a half, dueled the winner inside on the second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch and lost the place late. IRISH AFFAIR was allowed to settle to the
second turn then saved ground to no avail. BARBELLO (NZ) had no speed, tried to rally three deep on the second turn but came up empty in the drive.
VONHRA had no speed and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SHE'S SO PRETTY was unhurried to the half, bid three wide on the second turn then shifted in, found plenty of room inside, rallied in the final furlong and
caught LULUMARU late. LULUMARU attended the pace two wide to the second turn, responded to the stretch, drifted out in the final furlong and was
collared late. AROUSE N GO was settled to the half, raced two wide to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch then got outfinished. FAMILY TRIPS
stalked the leaders three wide to the half, was fanned four wide on the second turn, tried to respond in the drive but came up empty. SWEET CHAYANE
lagged to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch then shifted out and showed some late interest. CHARLIE'S BELLE had no speed and saved
ground to no avail. ANNA LEE ENCORE flashed speed outside rivals to attend the pace three wide, stayed on determinedly for six furlongs but was tiring in
the final furlong. LA GUAPA VELOS stalked the pace to the half, bid two wide on the second turn but was outrun to the stretch and gave way.
