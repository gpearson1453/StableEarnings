Footnotes
GET THEM JUSTIN forwardly placed from the outset, pressed three wide into the turn, dueled midway on the bend until entering the stretch when kicking
clear, slowly increased advantage under steady handling. MY BLARNEY STONE fell back steadily along the inside into the turn, continued to save ground
through the bend, steered out once straightened for home, finished willingly to be clear for the place. RUN AWAY SON broke in to bother FIRE WATCH at
the start, raced back off the pace and the inside, four wide out of the turn, staged a mild rally to be along for the show, no match for the top two. FIRE
WATCH bothered at the start to be last away, void of speed, five wide exiting the turn, displayed some mild late interest to improved position slightly. MAIL
MAN JOHNNY moved up along the inside to narrowly set the early pace, dueled through the turn inside the winner, chased that one past the furlong marker
then faltered to lose a couple of positions late. D'FESTIVE CAT broke sharp, pressed the issue early from between rivals, pursued the dueling leaders
through the turn then gave way in the drive. HESACALENDARBOY broke back, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
GENTRIFIED five wide into the first turn when within striking distance, pressed the issue three wide in the run up the backstretch, hooked up with the runner
up for a lengthy stretch duel, proved narrowly best while fully extended in a determined effort. MAGIC VOW pressed the soft pace off the inside, vied
between horses late in the second turn, dueled the length inside the winner, outkicked by that rival late, well clear for the place. HIDEAWAY HERO allowed
to settled while toward the inside, two path into the lane, roused, along for the show while drifting in a bit past the furlong marker, not a threat to the top two.
TRAPPER PEAK broke well, narrowly set a soft pace along the inside, could not match the top two in the drive, caught late for the show. SPIRIT OF
CALEDON failed to menace. BOSTON BOB back off the early pace, moved a bit closer the middle half, tired in the drive. WABASH CANNONBALL in mid
pack for five furlongs, came four wide when roused into the lane, had little left for the drive. HAWKS PEAK lacked speed in trailing, came five wide out of the
final turn, failed to muster a rally.

Footnotes
ARCTIC ROSE vied three wide out of the chute, fell back off the issue a bit in the run up the backstretch, rebid four wide far turn, once again contested the
issue in the three path into the lane, put the other speed away inside the furlong marker to edge clear, held the runner up safe late under steady handling.
SHAE'S DAY void of early foot, moved out, came four wide into the lane, rallied while remaining well out in the strip, slowly getting to the winner late. PAPA
BRO showed the way out of the chute closest to the inside, continued to narrowly set the pace into the turn, vied into the lane, began to weaken nearing the
furlong marker, drifted out slightly when clear of SLITHER, finished well in front of that rival for the show. SLITHER with the pace out of the chute between
horses and inside the winner, continued to force the issue into and through the turn remaining between horses, began to weaken when straightened for
home, steadied slightly as PAPA BRO was drifting out nearing the furlong grounds, continued to weaken in the late going. IMDUSTY last to leave, void of
speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. PRAY IDE SING within striking distance early, moved briefly closer while between horses and
three wide early in the turn, began to fade late in the bend. EATORBEEATEN settled off the pace, tired in the drive. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY
THE RIDER OF SLITHER AGAINST PAPA BRO FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE APPROACHING MIDSTRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO
STAND.

Footnotes
MY PAL TORRES stalked the leader from the outside, advanced on that rival in the three path turning for home, outside bid, took over, drew off under
steady hand ride to win ridden out. BAYOU BODE off a bit slow, back off the pace, dropped inside turn, closer along the rail entering the stretch, could do
little with the winner the final furlong, edged clear for the place. DIXIE BEAT in the second flight while off the rail, followed the winner into the stretch in the
three path, also proved no match for that one, outkicked for the place while holding the show late. SO SORRY RUSTON settled off the pace well out in the
strip, four wide into the stretch, went evenly to the wire. DOMINANTE lacked speed, came five wide out of the turn, lacked a significant closing response to
also finish up evenly. HANDSOME HARVE void of speed in trailing early, four wide exiting the turn, also was not dangerous in the run to the wire. JADE
STAR was finished early. BLACK JUSTICE away well, sprinted well clear out of the chute, continued to show the way through the turn, gave way when
headed by the winner entering the stretch.

Footnotes
FIRST METAL COUNT broke on top, cleared to the inside before the turn, set all the pace, drew off through the lane while feeling the whip only once to win
ridden out. FLASHBURN back off the early pace well out in the strip, remained five wide through the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive with
too much to do, clearly second best. DR. GELP chased the winner throughout off the inside, could do nothing with that rival in the drive nor contain the
runner up, saved the show. LIGHTNING HARBOUR went one paced throughout while racing four wide. ONE SMOOTH KATCH within striking distance in
the early going, came up empty for the drive. FOOLING JAY lacked early foot well wide, five out to six wide through the turn, improved slightly in the drive
without posing a serious threat. BLUE RIDGE SPICE broke back, moved up while six wide through the turn, flattened out in the drive. ADIEU GALAXY
made little impact in remaining back. BALD FACE LOGIC off a step slow, raced a bit greenly early, remained back in never threatening. TAY TAYS PICK in
mid pack early, backed up in the drive. BLACK HILLS BANDIT also in the main body early, gave way in the turn, pulled up in upper stretch in apparent
distress, vanned off.

Footnotes
JACI'S ROYALTY unhurried early while saving ground onto the main course, moved outside, advanced four wide into contention far turn, took over, clear
approaching the furlong grounds, dug in late between foes to gain the nod. SANDBAGGER AL broke well, allowed to settle in the second flight while saving
ground, moved out around a tiring foe late in the final turn when moving closer, dropped back inside when straightened for home, late bid inside the winner,
missed. CALCULATE lacked early foot, began a steady advance after a half, steered out in some traffic turning for home, came on the outside for the drive,
set down, finished willingly while too late and widest of the first group at the wire. WHATAFIND lacked early foot, enjoyed a good trip along the inside
through the final turn, improved, no threat to the top three. SAVING ARGUMENT away in good order, with the early pace along the inside, a bit rank onto
the backstretch, larger lead in the far turn, could not last when confronted entering the stretch. EGOMANIAC last to leave, void of speed, picked off a couple
of tiring rivals while never a threat. SILAO with the early pace while between rivals, carried out a bit by SAVING ARGUMENT exiting the first turn, gave way
after five furlongs. LA CLEVER with the pace outside, also carried a bit by SAVING ARGUMENT onto the backstretch, stopped after five furlongs and
finished well back. HALF MILE SPLIT UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
RHETT'S RACER within striking distance for a half inside, shifted out for the drive, set down, finished with good late energy to win going away. ROSE
RUNNER broke on top, dueled early along the inside, garnered a larger advantage through the turn, clear into the lane while moving off the inside, proved
no match for the winner late, held sway for the place. SHE'S A FAIR CATCH lacked early foot inside, advanced while continuing to save ground into the
stretch, rail bid late for the place, outfinished for that position, well clear of the others. ABLE CATCH prompted the while three wide up the backstretch,
raced closest to the runner up turning for home, had little left for the stretch run. MADISON'S PLACE broke well, dueled up front outside the runner up early,
began to gradually weaken entering the turn. SANDY'S WAGER lacked early foot, improved position off the inside without posing a serious threat. FICKLE
FLASH settled in mid pack early, had nothing left for the drive. OUR LADY'S PRAYER last to leave, remained always back in showing little.
UNMENTIONABLE was finished early.

Footnotes
BRING ME A CHECK broke alertly, showed the way into the first turn, continued to set the pace through some lively fractions in the run up the backstretch
and into the far turn, responded when challenged turning for home, found more in the drive to be clear again late. MIDNIGHT PATRIOT within striking
distance off the inside, asked along far turn, challenged the winner from the outside entering the stretch, could not match strides with that rival the final
furlong, remained clear for the place. DREWPOWER last to leave, lacked early speed, advanced into a striking position while being asked three wide in the
final turn, could do little more with the top two late, clear of the rest. OH MY ACHING ARCH went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response.
SILENT FORCE forwardly placed for five furlongs, had little lefrt for the drive. HE'S A LUCKY MAN broke near the rear and remained back in failing to
threaten. SHAR'S TREASURE chased the winner for a half off the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
PHAT AND FAST broke back, moved up steadily into a forward position before a quarter inside, traffic late in the turn, slipped through rail, inside bid, proved
best in a solid effort. TEN BROWNIES settled off the pace and the inside, also some in some traffic turning for home, switched out nearing the furlong
marker, finished willingly to be clear for the place. CAEUS IN PASADENA with the pace from the start, continued to vie into the lane, allowed the winner the
inside when straightened for home, could not match that one late or the runner up, narrowly saved the show. WHISKEY'S GONE within striking distance
early just off the inside, lost some position through the turn, four wide into the lane, improved position with some belated interest. HALOS PRAYER in the
second flight early outside after being last away, four wide middle move into a contending position turning for home, flattened out the final furlong. GRAND
OMEGA settled off the pace and the inside, moved slightly closer when fanned six wide into the lane, flattened out the final furlong. FIRE MAKERS STAR
void of speed for a half, passed tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. BAND BOSS pressed the issue for a half outside then gave way in the drive.
FLASH DANCERLUCK remained always back. LITTLE RED KID void of speed, came six wide out of the turn, failed to rally. SMOKIN' TRUTH mid pack for
a half, was five wide out of the turn, pulled up the final furlong, vanned off.
