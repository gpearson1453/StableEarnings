WILLY TELL HIM vied inside a rival going on or just off the fence, headed midway on the turn, regained command in upper stretch, held sway while being
kept to task despite drifting out a bit near the wire. SIDNEY'S HOPE pressed outside the winner, went two to three wide on the turn, drifted out a bit in the
stretch under left-handed urging but kept on well. SUPER SWISS settled, went two to three wide outside a rival on the turn, was gaining inside late.
CRUMAN TAPOTE chased from outside going four wide on the turn then weakened. FEARLESS ALEX lacked early speed, raced off the inside in the three
to four path through the turn, ran on mildly but belatedly. SMART SPREE tracked inside on or just off the rail, dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
HUMDINGER settled between the second flight off the leading group going two to three wide on the first turn then moving out a bit entering the run up the
backstretch, edged a little closer into the far turn moving from three deep to the two path midway on that bend, came out again in upper stretch, struck the
lead inside the final seventy yards and drove past. SPEED BUMP tracked the leading pair inside on the first turn, switched out early up the backstretch
commenced a bid between foes past the seven-sixteenths and taking the lead at the three-eighths, edged clear late on the far turn and into upper stretch
but was collared late. PROSSER'S KITTEN raced outside the second flight early going four wide on the first turn and a bit wider up the backstretch,
continued outside four wide on the far turn, could not kick on with the top pair but captured show honors. SUTAH WHO hesitated at the start spotting the
field a couple lengths, was allowed to settle racing just off the fence, began to advance on the far turn initially from the rail and moving out three deep
coming nearer the three-sixteenths, went wider still into upper stretch and gained position. GOOD FOR NOW attended the pace from outside going three
wide early, continued in pursuit three wide on the far turn then weakened. DIAMANTE APPEAL was urged forward at the break, set the tempo from the two
path, shifted in entering the backstretch, began to weaken leaving the backstretch and continued to drop back tired. SPECIALYKINDACRAZY was inside
the second flight, came out a bit up the backstretch, began to drop back in the two path heading to the far turn, was eased through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
REBOUNDER prompted from between runners, went three then two wide on the turn taking a narrow lead, held under steady handling. JIM EDD WHO
stalked from outside, went four then three wide on the turn, drifted out in upper- to mid-stretch but kept on well late. DECK HUMOR switched outside a rival
entering the turn, went two wide then moved back nearer the rail on that bend, made a mild bid at the head of the lane but lacked the needed late kick.
OFFENSIVE settled between runners early, moved three then four wide on the turn, ran on evenly. F S POSITRACK had brief speed inside runners but off
the rail, moved to the rail entering the turn, dropped back and weakened. DINOS DA DADDY was a bit awkward away from the gates, went four wide on the
turn and failed to threaten.
