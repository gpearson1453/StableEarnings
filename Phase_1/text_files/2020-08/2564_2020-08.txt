Footnotes
VOODOO VALLEY stalked three to four wide, was under pressure into the lane, kept on grinding under right handed encouragement, seized command
about a sixteenth from home and drew clear. CHUCK'S DREAM cleared early, set the pace two to three wide into the lane, failed to contain the winner
nearing the sixteenth marker, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. JUST CHILL OUT rated between foes, edged up nearing the lane, shifted in and
kept on with some effort. PISTOLEIRO saved ground, was under pressure pursuing into the lane, eased out and faded. ROCKIN RON , three deep leaving
the half mile marker, was under a ride nearing the lane and came up empty. STUCCO saved ground while off the pace, came under a solid ride past the half
mile marker but failed to respond. IRISH CROSSING , four wide outside rivals, took a bad step mid turn, pulled up lame and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BLUE SKY VENEZUELA rated forwardly while three wide, took closer order four wide into the lane, responded when put to solid asking, closed under right
handed rousing to take over a sixteenth from home, kicked clear and was taken in hand the final strides. GREASEDLIGHTNING rated three wide early on,
edged closer while in the clear past the three eighths, shifted five wide into the lane and churned on willingly to gain the place. BARBSGRAY LION pulled
her way clear soon after the start, set the pace two wide into the lane, ceded command a sixteenth out and faded. GROUP TEXT flashed speed inside,
dropped back leaving the far turn then came back slightly in the final furlong. LADY ROZINA edged up between runners after a furlong and gained a stalking
spot, was under pressure into the lane and weakened. KUPURI broke a step slow, was hustled along off the rail leaving the far turn, came four wide for the
drive but failed to make an impact. CASH REGISTER was checked off heels nearing the four and a half furlong marker and dropped back.

Footnotes
TEAM EFFORT got engaged in a duel outside PARDON THE PUN soon after the break, shook clear of that one leaving the three sixteenths then was fully
extended to prevail. TOE CURLIN' KISS lacked speed, dropped in nearing the turn, came under pressure into the lane, angled out advancing past the
quarter pole, checked off heels nearing mid stretch, regrouped to advance between rivals and finished gamely to steadily gain. LYNCHBURG rated off the
dueling leaders about three wide, dropped back a bit while under strong urging nearing the five sixteenths, found a bit more to edge closer near mid stretch
but failed to seriously follow through. PARDON THE PUN dueled to the inside of the winner, shifted out when that one cleared then faded. NOBLE WEED ,
three to four wide, was under asking nearing the lane and gave way.

PROPER ATTIRE showed a solid burst of speed and cleared soon after the break, dropped in and set a rated pace, opened up after being set down nearing
the lane and was kept to solid handling to deep stretch. BETCHA BY GOLLY chased two to three wide and held well to be clear of the rest. DARE TO
PROMISE saved ground chasing the winner, eased out and kept on with effort. GREEN EYES stumbled in behind leaving the gate and was away slowly,
rated well back while about three wide, shifted further out for the drive, responded to pressure and finished with interest. NICOLAR gave three wide pursuit,
made a mild run mid turn then faded in the final furlong. STOP TALKING , between foes near the half mile marker, raced three wide in the clear past the five
sixteenths, angled in and lacked a bid. STAR OF SHANGHAI stumbled badly at the break, settled well back, raced three wide in upper stretch and failed to
make a serious recovery. SONG OF HONOR , urged along while saving ground, gave way.

COCONUT CAKE , three to four wide, ranged up into the lane, bid outside a pair of rivals in mid stretch, emerged in a head to head battle outside BREAK
CURFEW through the final seventy yards, kept on under right handed rousing and got the bob. BREAK CURFEW bobbled at the break, recovered to show
speed then chase the leader, moved up under pressure and challenged between runners with a furlong remaining, gained a slim lead under left handed
asking approaching the sixteenth pole, went nose to nose with the winner in the final yards and just missed. FIFTEEN ROYALS had speed outside foes then
went clear, dropped in to set the pace, was taken on by the top two nearing mid stretch, fought on then gave way grudgingly in the final yards. A GIRL
NAMED JAC , off the early pace, moved up four wide between runners nearing the lane but lacked a solid finish. CAROLINA ICE saved ground pursuing
into the stretch and came up empty. MARY'S JEWEL , between rivals early, lost ground four to five wide around the turn but never got on track. BEACON
OF TRUTH had speed then rated back off the leader, stalked three wide, was under pressure past the five sixteenths then faded. ADABEL failed to menace
while saving ground. TAP THAT CAT broke slowly and was outrun.

Footnotes
TOUGHEST 'OMBRE rated inside foes while well in touch of the leader, eased out for room and moved between rivals mid turn, edged up to take aim on
the LUCKY RAMSEY into the lane, was guided further out past the quarter pole, kept on doggedly under a drive, moved alongside past the sixteenth pole,
forged ahead late and was edging away. LUCKY RAMSEY settled off the rail, angled out leaving the far turn, rolled up four wide and took command past the
three eighths, kicked clear approaching the lane, wandered outward under a drive past the furlong grounds, dug in when collared then gave way grudgingly
in the final fifty yards. COLONEL JUAN , three to four wide, bid past the half mile marker, sparred briefly and to the inside of LUCKY RAMSEY mid turn,
shifted in to chase into the lane and faded. DIVINE INTERVENTIO , towards the inside and under some rating, steadied briefly nearing the three eighths,
swung wide and offered a mild kick. THREETHEHARDWAY , three wide early, angled out and made a four wide mid move, chased to upper stretch but
came up empty. YOWZA YOWZA YOWZA settled off the pace, raced three wide into the lane but lacked a bid. MOONLIGHT SHADOW lagged back,
swung wide for the drive and failed to generate a solid run. ONCE MORE EH sped clear, set the pace towards the inside, ceded past the half mile then tired
approaching the lane. RIVER DEEP gave early chase three wide and faltered. ACROSS THE AISLE prompted the pace two wide, moved to a slim lead
leaving the far turn, had little left past the three eighths and retreated.
