Footnotes
TRUENO stalked the pace dueling through the far turn to upper stretch extending abreast foe drawing clear late. TANTALIZING hustled clear set the pace
being hooked on the far turn dueling in upper stretch ceding on the inside rival late. EL DUQUE raced evenly off the pace as best of others. STUDY HABITS
was always outrun. MINERS VICTORY offered little. TITERE took a bad step near the seven sixteenths pole being eased from there.
