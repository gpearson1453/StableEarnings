Footnotes
WANDERING KITTEN chased the pace near the inside for a half, drifted out to the five path entering the stretch, closed with a burst of speed in the final
sixteenth of a mild and got up in the final strides. SOUTHERN SPIRIT away alertly, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and just missed hanging on.
RISKY GUY allowed to settle, began to rally on the turn in the five then six paths, drifted out through the stretch past mid track despite strong right handed
whipping and was steadily gaining ground late. JOE CAIN unhurried early, swung wide and closed with a burst of speed past mid track. Z J WINS trailed
into the stretch then closed with a rush in the four path. ARATHORN with the second flight between horses two wide, failed to respond. SUPER FLEET with
the second flight three wide, was through after a half. HENNESSY FIRE saved ground and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. LEAP BABY LEAP had brief
speed. MASCHERATO close up in the six path into the turn, swung wide and gave way in the stretech.

Footnotes
EOWYN'S PARADISE well placed, responded readily when set down on the turn, rallied in the five path to make the lead at the top of the stretch and drew
clear under strong handling. AUNT PEG was tight at the start, unhurried, swung wide and closed fast in the middle of the racetrack and got up for second.
PLUS SIZE VALUE never far back, finished with good courage in the six path. SAMTASTIK vied for the lead through the turn, inched closed nearing the top
of the stretch then leveled off. MISS LEGS dueled for the lead along the inside into the turn, had speed into the stretch then faded. IMPAZIBLE MINK
dueled for the early lead two wide, took charge on the turn, set the pace to the top of the stretch then gave way. GUN THING drifted out at the start and was
outrun. HALIE'S ARCH had speed into the turn then wilted.

Footnotes
LUV LYES broke i front, set all the pace while cleverly rated and widened through the stretch to win in hand. DROP DEAD GORGEOUS never far back,
advanced three wide before the far turn, chased the winner the balance of the trip and just held on for second in the three path. MRS. ROBINSON stalked
the pace from the four path into the stretch, dropped inside and finished determinedly just missing second. JUSTICEINACTION failed to menace. SOUTH
BEACH GIRL had brief speed. CHOLMONDELEY pressed the pace two wide despite her saddle slipping on the clubhouse turn, kept pressure into the far
turn and dropped out of it. NATALIA'S TEMPLE offered little and was eased to the wire.

going away. SHE'S CRAFTY was bumped at the start, allowed to settle, swung wide and rallied for second. LEXY ANNA away alertly, set a pressured pace
along the rail into the stretch then weakened in the final furlong. KIST was bumped at the start then failed to menace. PINK HALDER was antsy in the gate,
broke poorly and was. TRUE LIGHT bore out at the start causing a chain reaction of bumping to her outside, prompted the pace into the stretch then
stopped and jogged to the wire.

Footnotes
BRILLIANTBENNY unhurried early, ducked in when struck with a right handed whip in upper stretch, angled out to the five path, closed fast and got up in
the final strides. C K'S LUCKY DUCK sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set all the pace, drifted out to the five path late and just missed hanging
on. MACADOOOO KID stalked the pace into the turn, advanced near the inside, checked when forced in by the winner before the furlong marker then
finished evenly. SEASONS END broke slowly and was never involved. MADDIE SON was no factor. CHILLINLIKAVILLIN chased the pace down the
backstretch and was through early. HAPPY TAKEOVER was outrun. CLASSIC VOLUME broke without a jockey and was declared a non starter. THE
STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF MACADOOOO KID LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE
WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH, AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED BRILLIANTBENNY AND PLACED HIM
THIRD, AND ALSO DECLARED CLASSIC VOLUME A NON-STARTER.
