Footnotes
HARPER'S GEM bumped at the start, stalked leaders in the three path on the backside, entered turn three wide, entered stretch in the five path, responded
strong to riders urging and surged at the wire to just get up. TIME N MONEY bumped at the start by inside and outside rivals, cleared to the rail approaching
turn, drifted into the stretch and entered stretch in the three path, gamely battled to wire to just miss by getting nailed at the wire. EVENING REWARD
bumped at the start, chased rival two wide along the backside, entered stretch in the four path and rallied well to just miss along the inside. P TOWN TITAN
reserved to the back of the field early, entered turn off the rail in the two path, coaxed for run on the turn, passed tired rival early in the stretch and lacked
enough kick to make any other headway. BONMONT chased leader along the inside on the backstretch, got in tight early in the turn and had to briefly
steady and lost ground, tired early in the stretch and hand ridden to wire.
