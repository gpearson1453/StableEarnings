RUDIE CAN'T FAIL vied inside for the early lead, took pressure through the turn inside of CLOVER BAR, widened at the top of the stretch and was kept to
task. COOL BREEZE hesitated at the start, gained closer order through the turn, rallied belatedly outside to earn place honors. CLOVER BAR hustled three
wide, prompted the pace through the turn but was unable to sustain the bid that was needed then flattened through the stretch and and caught late. IT'S NO
HOLIDAY away well, dropped back approaching the turn and passed tiring rival. HUNTERS PRIDE vied four wide in the opening stages and came up empty
for the drive. **STEWARD'S INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving COOL BREEZE but after review of the
Stewards there was no change made as it was deemed that COOL BREEZE received a fair start.

Footnotes
TEMPLE OF ZOOM broke sharply then led the field through the turn, responded willingly to challenge from WEALLDOIT, drew clear at the top of the stretch
and was kept to light handling while never under any threat. OLD DOUBLE DIAMOND hurried early, sat in range while three wide through the turn, came
under a drive into the stretch, gained ground late but was no threat to the winner. CUVEE TEE trailed the field entering the lane, uncoiled a rail bid into the
stretch drive and missed. SAFFRIANO chased mid pack while three wide, swung out at the top of the lane and passed tiring. WEALLDOIT hustled to the
turn then moved up to challenge the leader at the three eighths pole, was unable to sustain the bid that was required and gave way. BODEMONSTER
angled quickly towards the rail, lugged out mid turn, came under a drive at the three sixteenth pole then steadied between rivals at the top of the stretch and
yielded.

STOCKWATCHER vied three wide entering the backstretch, held a short advantage to the far turn, was under pressure at the head of the lane, responded
gamely to challenge from MY SAMURAI WARRIOR and held firmly to the wire. MY SAMURAI WARRIOR fanned five wide leaving the chute, prompted
outside, drove three wide into the lane, moved up to engage STOCKWATCHER under steady handling but was unable to get by. METRO DREAMER
lagged early, took closer order leaving the backstretch, hustled up three to four wide in the final turn and flattened. THE HYBRID attended the pace while
three to four wide, dropped back through the final turn, came on again in the stretch but failed to threaten. CAPITALISM pressed the pace inside, moved up
to contest the lead approaching the three eighths pole but was unable to move on with the eventual winner and faded. OIL CHANGE tracked outside and
retired early.

Footnotes
CITY OF PEARLS saved ground while showing the way, responded to looming threat from COPPER FOX at the top of the stretch and held sway. COPPER
FOX sat in striking position while four wide, loomed boldly at the head of the lane then was gaining late but was unable to erode the winners margins in time.
FLORIST stalked the pace from just off the rail, moved up into closer position leaving the backstretch and rallied through the drive to secure show. WHOOP
IT UP unhurried early, chased outside under urging but was unable to improve position through the stretch. SAMURAI GIRL lagged early and showed little
interest. DAZZLING CHIC lost irons early and was unable to recover.

Footnotes
PIPERS JOY saved along the rail, gained closer order at the quarter pole, rallied along the fence and was up in time, driving. ASTARTOBE sat in striking
position just off the pacesetters, bid four wide at the top of the lane, gained a short lead into the stretch drive but failed to hold the winner safe in the late
stages. SCREAMIN SUE angled in entering the turn, rallied steadily while three wide to earn show. ENTITLED STAR trailed the field early, rallied inside into
the stretch but missed for placing. RUBORIS vied inside for the early lead the took pressure through the turn, was unable to sustain the bid that was needed
for the drive and faded. DURA'S HALO lagged early, drifted through the stretch and failed to threaten. POP'S LITTLE GIRL prompted the early pace while
three wide and wilted abruptly early stretch.

RYANWATER sent for speed while three wide into the opening turn, sat just off the pace, gained the lead at at the five sixteenth marker, responded to
looming threat from PROVOCATIVE PRINCE and drove clear. PROVOCATIVE PRINCE tracked inside, raced in traffic at the top of the lane, drove between
rivals at the three sixteenth pole moving up alongside RYANWATER but could not get by. TANNIN allowed to settled four wide off the pacesetters, began
bid in the final turn the rallied into the stretch then flattened out finishing best of the others. ROLL THE STONE hustled four wide into the backstretch, settled
outside in range, chased the leaders into the stretch and faded gradually. KENTUCKY ROLL set a pressured pace inside, was overtaken in the final turn
and gave way. HEAD HONCHO chased throughout and failed to menace. SETTING THE TONE failed to reach contention. DEVILS COMMAND raced in
tight quarters mid way through the opening turn, gave way then was eased and walked off.

SOMETHING ABOUT ME sat in striking position while three wide through the backstretch, roused at the top of the lane, gained the lead outside and won
driving. CHICOUT D'TIGER under a snug hold early, took closer order leaving the far turn, swung out then was put to a drive, rallied steadily outside and
held sway for place. BONITA RAPIDS raced wide through the backstretch then went four wide into the far turn, gained closer order under encouragement,
angled inward approaching the stretch under a steady rally and just missed out for place. TEXAS ALLEY KAT quickly went to the front, showed the way to
the final turn and had little left in reserve for the drive. ROADSIDE KISSES trailed inside, advanced along the rail through the final turn and passed tiring
late. LYLA LORRAINE saved ground mid pack while four wide, dropped back and mild bid. PARCAM COWGIRL tracked outside and had no response when
asked. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY showed little.

SOCRATES hustled away to secure a position just off the rail, angled out sharply through a seam at the head of the lane, rallied determinedly outside and
nipped leader at the wire. COZY CAPER sent for outside speed then was quickest to the turn, was under attack at the top of the lane, stayed on evenly
through the stretch and was caught late. SHADY BIZ broke slow, closed the gap along the rail, found running room inside into the stretch, uncoiled a late
rally and just missed. OSO BRAVE lost ground into the far turn, circled the field into the lane, rallied steadily outside and flattened late stretch. FROST
CANYON lacked early speed and bid belatedly outside. EASTER HALO lost ground inside leaving the backstretch, launched an all out bid into the lane and
stopped. GROOMED vied inside from the four path, chased into the stretch and yielded. HE'S SMOAKIN failed to reach contention. HOLY OR NOT raced
wide into the opening turn and lacked a closing response. DOUBLE RANSOME fanned four wide leaving the backstretch, swung out into the lane and gave
way. TEEWISTED showed some early speed outside then fanned three wide in the turn and faltered.
