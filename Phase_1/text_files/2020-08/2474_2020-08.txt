Footnotes
BOATSWAIN stalked the pace into the stretch, responded readily when set down, surged rapidly three wide to make the lead in upper stretch then widened
the balance of the trip to win as much the best while in hand. UNCLE KEVIN was bumped at the start, never far back, rallied behind the winner into the
stretch, was bumped again a furlong out and finished well clear for second. JAMAICAN MAGIC dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, drifted out
bumping the runner up at the furlong marker then weakened. ARCHIPELAGO bore in at the start bumping UNCLE KEVIN, contested the lead along the rail
into the stretch then gave way late. SANDLOT SAM trailed.

CIRCLE WILL RUN chased the pace into the far turn, responded readily when set down, split rivals two wide past the quarter pole, made the lead in upper
stretch, brushed then widened under right handed urging to win as much the best. ANSWER QUIETLY stalked the pace into the far turn, rallied three wide
to gain a narrow lead near the quarter pole, brushed with the winner at the top of the stretch then was no match while clear for second. SWEET CHELSEA
settled inside, shifted out to the six path and had a mild rally through the stretch. MOBIL SONG allowed to settle, swung wide and passed tiring rivals in the
eight. SHACK'S HAREM sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace for six furlongs then weakened. PALI'S REWARD bore out at the start
bumping a rival and was outrun. HIGH CUPPER was no factor. SEEKING A JEWEL was bumped at the start and through after half.

STAR MABEE prompted the pace two and three wide into the stretch, drifted to the middle of the racetrack, dug in to make the lead a furlong out and drew
clear under brisk handling. FORTUNATE GINA sprinted up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace until mid stretch then was
no match for the winner. MISS MISCHIEVOUS vied for the lead between horses two wide, drifted to the five path in the stretch then went evenly. SHEZA
FINE JUSTICE lacked room along the rail down the backstretch while chasing the early pace and faded in the stretch. G'S SHIP LOAD angled outside soon
after the start, moved up four wide on the turn then came up. NATURAL BLING trailed down the backstretch, advanced on the turn in the four path then
weakened.

Footnotes
BLU HAWAII stalked the pace into the far turn, surged two wide to challenge the lead, battled along the inside the length of the stretch while drifting out and
proved best under right handed urging. PLUS SIZE VALUE allowed to settle, circled rivals rapidly three wide to make the lead on the far turn, battled with
the winner until deep stretch and finished well clear for second. EVEN IF void of early speed, rallied belatedly out near the middle of the racetrack through
the stretch. GUN THING was no factor. BETTER VIBES pressed the pace two wide for a half, made the lead then faltered on the far turn. OPEN CHECK
BOOK made the lead along the inside soon after the start, set the pace for a half, stopped abruptly, pulled up on the second turn and was walked off. CINS
BOSS stumbled badly unseating her rider and losing her bridle at the start. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW TOOK
NO ACTION.
