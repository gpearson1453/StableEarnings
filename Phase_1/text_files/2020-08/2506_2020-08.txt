SNAP DECISION tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled, jumped well to maintain position, was in briefly tight after jump six, advanced to be
just outside the leader after the final flight, took over command at the head of the stretch, got given some rein when asked a furlong from home, and drew
away handily to prevail comfortably on the wire. FAMILY TREE (GB) saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, jumped well to maintain position, came under
coaxing at the final flight, kept on through to the finish to secure the place honors while never threatening the winner. GALWAY KID (IRE) tracked the pace
just off the inside from just off the pace, jumped well to maintain position, took over command after the final flight, showed the way through the last turn, got
displaced from command at the head of the stretch and was roused in response, dug in under a drive weakening in the late stages, got nipped for the place
honors while clear for the show. ZANZI WIN (FR) three wide in pursuit from mid pack initially, advanced to be in closest aim of the spurting away leader at
fence four, then dropped back to near the rear, came under coaxing after the final fence and improved position for the last major share. CITY DREAMER
(IRE) saved ground near the rear, came under coaxing after the final fence, offered up a mild bid then weakened in the final furlong. DUC DE MERAN (FR)
established the front and spurted away just off the inside, bobbled at both fence five and fence seven, came under coaxing after flights eight briefly and nine,
yielded the front just after fence nine and tired. FAST CAR just off the inside near the rear of the field, jumped well, lost ground on the main flight after fence
eight and nine and failed to quicken, got eased along to the finish completing the course well behind under his own power. BELISARIUS (IRE) forwardly
placed just off the inside, completed the first three fences without incident, went off stride after fence three and was put to a protective hold and backed out
through the field appearing to have his right hind leg locked up, steadily got geared down to a walk, once again put weight back on his right hind leg walking
a bit gingerly as the rider pulled him up and dismounted, then was subsequently vanned off.

STIMULUS CHECK broke a half-step slow, established a good position in third, saved ground on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, gained into
upper stretch, angled out inside the three-sixteenths, rallied outside under a right-handed whip, closed well to get the lead just inside the furlong marker then
drew away under steady urging. JILL'S A HOT MESS lost her footing slightly at the start but came away quickly, pressed the pace on the outside then in the
three path on the turn, was roused inside the five-sixteenths, took the advantage under a right-handed whip in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed whip
at the furlong marker, lost the lead to the winner shortly thereafter and proved no match while well clear for the place. SIESTA KEW broke very alertly, set
the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage while put to the whip in
upper stretch, dropped back inside the furlong marker and tired while clearly best of the rest. GRAY LOLLIPOPS was hustled from the start then ridden
along off the pace, dropped back while three wide on the turn and failed to respond. RUBY STILETTO broke a bit slow, moved out early then was ridden
along towards the rear, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. SASSY BELLE dropped back under strong urging on
the outside, fell well behind the rest of the field, floated very wide late on the turn and was pulled up then walked off.

Footnotes
INGRASSIA took up residence in the two path after suffering through a series of light bumps shortly after the start, sat well reserved keeping watch on the
front runners, quickened getting maneuvered into the three path leaving the three-eighths pole, swung into the lane and was given her cue, began the final
furlong as the main challenger to STUNNING PRINCESS, chipped away at the deficit stride by stride, proved relentless to the end, wearing down the
stubborn second place finisher in the shadow of the finish line. STUNNING PRINCESS the only member of this sextet unscathed after the start, assumed a
forward position, was well held stalking the leader from path two, hitched up to that rival as three-quarters was being rattled off, was coming up to the
three-sixteenths marker when turned loose, emerged a sixteenth later as the leader but with the runner up bearing down hard to the outside, saw that foe
whittle away at advantage steadfastly, was determined to the wire but wound up denied. REINA DEL SOL brushed with another several strides into the
contest, worked out a tuck into the pocket approaching the conclusion of the homestretch, tracked MO NORMAL without making her presence felt in a
meaningful manner, got angled four wide into the stretch, straightened away and secured the show. MO NORMAL lightly bumped a few times in the region
of her hind quarters, established the top, cut over to the inside route, carved out the pace being rated along, attended by STUNNING PRINCESS out in the
two path, felt an uptick in pressure after departing the backstretch, got roused when tested in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, relinquished then
steadily weakened. PUMA PUNKU went inward after bobbling right after the field had been sent off and running, got squeezed shortly afterwards, took up
the chase from path two, was called upon for more as the third fraction was being finalized, made into the lane, lacked the needed response. TINDER DATE
checked getting squeezed a little beyond the gate, was affected the most of everyone involved in the bumping incident, got guided over to the hedge,
remained stationed on it in pursuit of the pace, cut the corner under a drive, had no rally.

MAJID established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside through the first turn and then two to three wide down the backstretch and
through the far turn, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, drifted out under a near sided stick while edging clear to the finish. STREET TRUST
along the inside through the opening bend, chased just off the inside down the backstretch until tipped three wide at the half mile pole looking to engage the
leader from the outside, came under coaxing four wide at the five-sixteenths, cornered three to four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one
while running on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest. CURLIN GREY chased two to three wide under urging from the seven-sixteenths, angled
four wide for home and tired, then got pulled up quickly after the finish. HOFFENHEIM coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide, came under urging
five wide at the seven-sixteenths, got eased spinning five wide into upper stretch and jogged home through the stretch to the finish coming to a walk near
the wire, then walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
ABIDING STAR was hustled to the lead, showed the way while inside to the two path with company to his outside, was asked under threat inside the
five-sixteenths, came under a right-handed whip approaching the furlong marker, shook clear under a drive in upper stretch, responded well in the final
furlong and held under strong urging. FINANCIAL SYSTEM was taken under a tight hold on the initial straightaway, went around the first turn in the four
path under stout restraint, was rated outside on the backstretch, went three then four wide while let out on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole,
came five wide into the stretch then was carried out near the three-sixteenths, moved into second inside the furlong marker, switched back to his inside lead
late and came home evenly while able to get the place. WILLING TO SPEED was taken in hand early, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was
reserved off the pace, went two then three wide while asked on the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and finished with good energy for the show.
ZERO GRAVITY angled in towards the rear, tossed his head while keen into the first turn, traveled around that bend in the two path, was reserved in the
back half of the field, went around the far turn in the two path while put to urging, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick.
MCERIN conceded the lead to the winner early then moved out some while placed under restraint, went three wide on the first turn, was rated in third
position, came under urging with three furlongs to run, chased three then four wide on the far turn, drifted out under a left-handed whip in upper stretch,
switched to a right-handed whip around the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. GO POKE THE BEAR stood in the gate and was off slow,
dropped well behind while very sluggish early, rounded the first turn in the three path, settled at the rear, was urged along while three then four wide on the
far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. GOLDEN DECISION was reserved on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, saved
ground into the stretch and failed to rally. ANOTHER raced inside early on the first turn then moved to the two path, stalked outside on the backstretch,
turned up the pressure on the leader in the three path on the far turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and capitulated.

IN FRONT dove over to the hedge after the start, got rated tracking the front runners, was on hold awaiting options as three-quarters was being completed,
stayed put on the inside route entering upper stretch and was given her cue, flashed interest and closed the gap, got checked off the heels of PURE WOW
lacking optimal clearance with approximately a sixteenth to go, had the aforementioned rival shift towards the outer border of the inside route in the heat of
the battle a few strides later, skimmed the hedge slipping by soon afterwards, forged to the front in the final seventy yards then edged away from a stubborn
JOYOUS TIMES. JOYOUS TIMES slid into the pocket after the field had been sent off and running, was well rated staying within striking distance of the
leader, spun into the stretch, got asked for more making her way into the two path right around the the three-sixteenths pole, clawed her way towards the
one to catch, saw the winner take over in the final stages, gamely procured the place. PURE WOW taken hold of after breaking slightly to the outside,
worked her way to the front end, got guided over to the inside shortly after entering the clubhouse bend, carved out the pace, well rated and with KITTEN
BY THE SEA in accompaniment from the outside, got asked for her best coming up to the three-sixteenths pole, inched out a bit under siege a furlong down
the road, opening up the inside corridor wide enough long enough for IN FRONT to launch what proved to be her decisive move, yielded, and weakened
into the show slot. KELLEYCANRUN sat reserved in the two path, tipped into path three at the five-sixteenths pole, swung out yet one more stepping into
the stretch, flattened out in the final furlong. RIVENDELL inside both turns, travelled in path two for a spell along the backstretch, angled out four wide for
the drive, made no impact. BALON ROSE strung out three wide on the first turn, underwent a two wide pursuit, came three wide into the stretch, briefly
steadied behind a weakening KITTEN BY THE SEA in upper stretch, failed to fire appreciably. KITTEN BY THE SEA prompted the pace two wide until the
three-sixteenths pole, folded. BAREEQA two wide early, went three wide onto the backstretch, was back into path two for the beginning of the run around
the second bend, fanned out five wide from upper to midstretch, had no offering and wound up the trailer throughout.

Footnotes
TOBYS HEART broke a step slow, was hard held towards the back, went three wide early on the turn, shifted five wide while asked at the five-sixteenths,
rallied outside into upper stretch, took the lead under a right-handed whip just inside the furlong marker and proved best under strong handling. JOY'S
ROCKET was hustled to the lead and set the pace, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed
whip in upper stretch, drifted out outside the furlong marker, was headed by the winner inside the furlong marker and outfinished in the final sixteenth while
clear for the place. AMANZI YIMPILO (IRE) tracked the pace on the outside, went two to three wide on the turn, was given her cue at the quarter-pole,
drifted out under a left-handed whip in upper stretch, battled with the top two into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked
while able to hold the show. MISCHIEVOUS DREAM was rated on the outside while given some cover behind a foe, went three to four wide on the turn,
chased behind foes into upper stretch, moved out behind those rivals while still on her inside lead into the final furlong, switched to the proper lead shortly
thereafter and weakened. QUINOA TIFAH settled off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was roused inside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. SWEET SOUPER SWEET broke a half-step slow, settled towards the back under some urging,
saved ground on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HARA stumbled at the start but
recovered quickly, was well placed just off the pace on the inside, saved ground on the turn, was asked given her cue at the five-sixteenths, chased inside
into upper stretch and came up empty then was vanned off after the race and reported to have bled. SASSY HANNAH was off slow then came inward while
spotting the front many lengths, settled at the rear, was asked while four wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
BIG AL'S GAL responded to a light hand ride after the start to establish the top, showed the way thereafter on a loosely-contested advantage for the initial
three-quarters riding the hedge, got put to a drive for the drive home, held well, felt the presence of the runner up leaving the sixteenth pole, dug in to
preserve the decision. EIGHTY SEVEN NORTH saved ground for six furlongs, swung out four wide into the late, kicked in around the sixteenth pole,
flashing good energy garnering second. LITTLE RED BUTTON three wide entering the clubhouse bend, managed to tuck into path two by the midway point
on it, stalked the winner from the outside, got roused heading home, failed to dent into the margin, stayed for the show. GO ZAPPEM took the inside route
during the opening phases, was in path two travelling on the second bend, went into the lane, mustered up the mildest of rallies. BROVIA pursued the pace
towards the fwo path on the turn, was one farther off the inside and in between rivals racing on turn two, arrived into the stretch, flattened out in the last
eighth. TORNADO CROSSING underwent a two wide for nearly six furlongs, got steered out in the direction of path five from upper to midstretch, narrowed
in but without mich impact. SANDRA'S MINE secured the pocket at the top of the first turn, kept watch on the front runners, got asked for more right around
the quarter pole, lacked a solid closing punch. WOMEN NOT EASY sighted three wide and rank on the bit while appearing keen on the opening bend,
tipped out to be the widest of all on the backstretch, middle-moved itself into contention, departed the backstretch from path four, commenced the stretch
slightly wider, backed away. SWEET BREEZE raced four to three wide on the first turn, was more the latter travelling on the next one, inched over to the
hedge in time to cut the corner into the lane although with seemingly little left, readily retreated. DEVILS RENDEZVOUS hung out in the three path on each
bend, failed to menace.
