RACINGINTHESTREET set the pace racing with a clear lead, responded when roused and held well under urging through the lane. SNOW FORECAST
chased the winner from the outset, rallied outside entering the stretch, dug in gamely and held on to earn the place spot. MY SISTER'S KEEPER chased
between rivals, raced between foes into the lane, rallied outside and missed for second. LADY MAGICA raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the turn
and finished evenly. RITHM BOX raced off the pace, had an inside trip and lacked a rally. SANITY chased close up three wide, chased outside a rival on the
turn and weakened in the lane. MAGIC HATTER raced off the pace and did not factor. LOLANITA raced off the pace, off the rail, came three wide into the
lane and tired.
