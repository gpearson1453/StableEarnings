FLUSHED tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid three wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain and drew off late.
STARS AND GOLD sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then was no match for the winner late
and held the place. DIALED IN ON ALICE never far back, gained a striking position down the backstretch, held position on the two path through the turn, bid
outside the leader into the lane and flattened out. CHOCOLATE TWIST ran evenly. SHAENA BUE passed a tiring rival. PRATT well placed outside, faded
after a half.

Footnotes
DOUBLE RAINBOW allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady gain and drove clear
late. GIANT'S VOICE mid pack, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, shook clear, then was no
match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. POINTMAN allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into
the lane and edged up for the show. AVAST MATEY tracked the pace back, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch
and weakened the final furlong. MUSICALITY pulled to a long lead quickly, then stopped through the second turn. VIZCAINO fractious in the gate, hit the
gate at the start and was no factor. STARRY MESSENGER well placed and inside, clipped heels mid way of the turn and lost the rider, walked off. A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE, RESULTED IN NO CHANGE.

ZOYSIA well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, shook clear quickly, then
drew off and was kept to the task. KELLY BE KRUSIN never far back, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, then
could not threaten the winner and held the place safe. SHOMETHESISTERS allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the
lane and did not have enough late. RUN LAUGHING broke through the starting gate pre-start, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid on that
path into the lane and flattened out. NO LIMIT BABE mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and weakened in
the drive. MORALITY CLAUSE ran evenly. GEN Z improved position. PRETTY CHARLEE broke through the gate pre-start, sprinted to a clear lead quickly,
then faded after a half. URIAH'S LEGACY reluctant to load, was never involved.
