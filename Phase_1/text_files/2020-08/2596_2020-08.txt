Footnotes
HICKORY DICKORYDOC hopped at the break, quickly recovered to stalk the leader while racing along the inside down the backstretch, gained command
nearing the far turn, dug in late while four wide and prevailed under all out pressure. CELESTIAL CHEETAH was allowed to settle in the early stages,
moved up five wide through the stretch drive and just missed in a game effort. MAGNIFICENT MAGS was unhurried early, moved up four wide into the
upper stretch and showed good late interest. TAKINGTIMEOFF set all the pace from the outside and weakened through the stretch. PLANE DRUNK stalked
the early pace, raced towards the inside throughout and had no response. LADY CARMELA dropped back early, saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
SILVER EDGE pressed the pace, raced towards the inside throughout, came on again deep stretch to prevail in a determined run under strong
encouragement. MR. VECCHIO stalked the early pace, moved up four wide at the quarter pole, led nearing the sixteenth pole and missed in a game effort.
CALL FITZROY stalked the pace while racing between rivals, raced three deep in the drive and had not enough late. PURRS AGAIN stalked the early pace,
raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. NOBLE KING dropped back early, moved up six wide at the eighth pole and had not
enough. NOBODYKNOWSNOTHIN was unhurried early, raced five deep into the lane and had no rally. MAGIC WIZARD settled off the early pace, raced
towards the inside and had no response. CURRY'S MOUNTAIN was along while racing along the inside to show good speed and tired. FLASH IS BACK
dropped back soon after the start and failed to menace.

Footnotes
COMMANDER'S INTENT stalked the pace, moved up four wide through the lane and finished well to get up under strong urging. TRAVELIN GAMBLER set
all the pace, raced three wide through the stretch drive and couldn't hold off the winner late to be second best. SMART WARRIOR was unhurried early,
moved up between rivals in the stretch, raced five wide nearing the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire. EXCHANGE FEVER stalked the early pace,
raced six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough late. GIANT VIKING settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside and had no rally.
COWBOY GANDHI dropped back early, raced five deep into the lane and never was a factor. THE MASON FACTOR raced up close early and failed to
sustain a bid. STERLING CANYON failed to have a response.

PLATINUM PAYNTER set all the pace and drew off the final stages to be well clear under an energetic hand ride. CAR LADY was unhurried early, moved
up four wide at the quarter pole but was no match for the winner in the drive. OLIVE'S BUMPA stalked the pace while racing along the inside down the
backstretch, raced five wide at the eighth pole and had no late closing bid. FILLY RIDE tracked the leader while racing two wide and tired. SO WHO'S
BACK stalked the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and tired. CAILIN ALAINN settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside around the far
turn through the stretch and failed to have a response.

Footnotes
SEANY P was allowed to settle early, moved up six wide through the stretch and finished well to get up under strong handling. GRAVEL ROAD vied for the
lead while racing along the inside and kept on to the wire. SKOL FACTOR stalked the pace, raced in the four path through the lane and finished willingly to
the wire. FORT FORTITUDE stalked the pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and weakened a bit late. SPLICETHEMAINBRACE was hustled along
from the inside to press the pace and weakened in the drive. PERFECT COVER was slow early, saved ground and never was a factor.
SINGANOTHERSONG was fanned seven wide into the upper stretch and had no rally.
