step slowly, rushed up to a clear lead, dueled in the lane, came again in a good effort, but lacked the needed kick. MAMMOTH mid pack, saved ground on
the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and closed well for the show. BOARDWALK BOB allowed to settle, saved ground through the
turn, came through inside into the stretch and edged up for a share. LAUGHINAGAIN no factor, widest. PITON tracked the pace, saved ground through the
turn, came through inside and faded.

IMPERIAL KING sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. NICE
ACE broke in at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, then could not match strides and held the place safe.
CHANNEL FURY steadied after the start, was well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch
and missed the plc. SUMMERFEST allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide into the stretch, then drifted in and got up
for a share. DRUNKEN LOVE rated inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then weakened in the late going.
BROOKLYN LAW improved position. KICK IT CHARLIE well placed, steadily lost ground. CHAINSAW AL was no factor.

Footnotes
GO HIPPO GO never far back, looped up four wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up late. CORTEGE
tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and
edged up late. ORCHESTRAL stalked the pace on the outside, gained a short lead through the second turn, then weakened late and held the show. C THE
KING allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and got up for a share. ECHOES OF THUNDER
allowed to settle, looped three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. TIGER PAW mid pack, looped up three and
four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and flattened out. BEING THERE mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened in the drive. GIANT'S VOICE well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that
path into the lane and faded the final furlong. TIZ TITUS was never involved. INMYFATHERSIMAGE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on
when challenged, then had no rally.
