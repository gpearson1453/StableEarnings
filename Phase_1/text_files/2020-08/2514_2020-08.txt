Footnotes
GAZING stalked the pace of TELSA while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin into the stretch and held
SEMI SWEET at bay late. SEMI SWEET was pushed out at the start then was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive,
finished willingly but could not get to the winner late. LITTLE DANCER showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and finished with
good late energy. TESLA broke out, set a pressured pace from off the rail, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. CHOTEAU was void of early
speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not menace. SHOE GAME broke sharply to press the pace of TELSA while racing three-wide and
weakened after going three-quarters.

Footnotes
ZIPPIN SEVENZ was bumped at the start, pressed the pace of TAKE YOUR SWINGS while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
quarter and drew off through the lane. LIBERTY'S FINALE broke inward, pressed the pace from the inside, steadied nearing the three-eighths pole, angled
out approaching the stretch and failed to gain on the winner in the drive. SLEW'S LEGACY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through
the turn and lacked the needed late response. TAKE YOUR SWINGS was bumped at the break, set a pressured pace from off the rail and gave way after
going a half. GREY POINT broke in, raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. SHADY DRIFTER lacked early
foot, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention. MISTER FIRE lagged throughout.

Footnotes
NORSKI was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, drifted through the lane while rallying and was up in the closing
yards. FREESTONE was bumped at the break then raced just off the leaders, moved four-wide through the turn, was carried out by the winner through the
lane and just missed. THE METAL MAN broke sharply to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run but could not
resist the top pair late. R B EYE raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with good energy.
ALWAYS WORKING was bumped at the break, pressed the pace while racing three-wide, was carried out nearing the quarter, angled in and did not
menace. SHAMISEN showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MOJAVE was void of early foot, raced five-wide
through the turn and did not offer a bid. LIVE A GOOD LIFE lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
SHEZ A GRINDER raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, reached the fore inside the eighth pole and edged
away late. SASSY EDIE lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter, reached the leaders with a furlong to
run but could not match strides with the winner late. GOLD SUPPLY stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take a slight edge into the
stretch, drifted in with a furlong to run and gave way. SALTY LITTLE LASS was bumped at the start then was reserved just off the leaders early, angled out
into the stretch, steadied nearing the eighth pole and lost best chance. COASTAL REIGN disputed the pace with HARDSENSE from the inside and gave
way through the final furlong. SOPHIE'S DREAM was bumped at the start, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, drifted in nearing
the eighth pole and finished evenly. STORMY MIST was off slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to menace. HARDSENSE was
away in good order to duel for the lead while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. EARLY MORN broke out, raced off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. THE RIDER OF SASSY EDIE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST GOLD SUPPLY CONCERNING
THE STEADYING OF HIS MOUNT IN MID-STRETCH AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS CONCLUDED GOLD SUPPLY DRIFTED
IN AND CAUSED THE INFRACTION AND WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH.

Footnotes
STYLE DADDY broke in the air, raced unhurried early, advanced four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew off.
CATS GULCH settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished willingly. EMPIRE RULER was
off a step slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. ROYAL BAR was off a
step slow, rushed to contend, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and failed to gain late. INTELICRYPT was bumped at the start, set a pressured
pace from off the rail and gave way through the final sixteenth. REGAZZE CAT lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to menace.
DAYTONA BEACH was bumped at the start, disputed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. ROB'S GOT GAME settled off the
leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. FAIR ADVANTAGE showed brief speed and weakened.
