Footnotes
AGOG set the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and widened down the lane under a brisk drive. ARTIE'S ROSE stalked the pace early from the
inside, fanned into the lane while bumping and carrying TAKEAWAY out and had no gain on the winner in the final stages. TAKEAWAY tracked the pace
early on, was bumped and carried out by ARTIE'S ROSE into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. EUROPA was slow and came out at the start,
trailed the field early on, was in the eight path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. PROFIT'S CAUSE chased the pace
early, was in the seven path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. The rider of TAKEAWAY claimed an objection against the rider of ARTIE'S
ROSE for interference entering the lane but after review by the stewards the claim was disallowed.

Footnotes
MEISTER brushed the gate at the start, advanced along the rail into the turn to stalk from the pocket at the five sixteenths pole shifted three wide turning for
home to bet outside of the leaders, awkwardly switched leads passing the furlong pole, but sustained his rally to prevail between horses. ORB OF THE
BORO vied for the lead along the inside of LOOKIN FOR LOKI, shook loose of that foe turning for home and drew clear in upper stretch, but tired in the final
furlong and was bested by an outer rival approaching the wire, then dead heated for place. SMILEY SOBOTKA tracked from midpack two wide, shifted four
wide in upper stretch, rallied while on his left lead to produce a late three wide bid, but failed to catch the leader and dead heated for place. LOOKIN FOR
LOKI vied for the lead outside of ORB OF THE BORO, but failed to keep pace with that foe at the three sixteenths pole, and tired. BUFFALO SHUFFLE
stalked the pace three wide, but failed to keep pace with the leaders passing the five sixteenths pole, lost position between horses under a hold, then kept
on to regain fifth through the lane. BUSINESS MODEL tracked from midpack three wide, advanced four wide around the turn before shifting five wide
turning for home, but flattened out. CHIEF RON was off slowly, saved ground while far off of the pace around the turn, and failed to factor. SNOWBLIND
tracked far off of the pace two wide, rallied inot the turn before shifting to the four path, then the seven path turning for home, but failed to menace. BEAT
DUKE was off slowly and was never involved. HONORARIAN raced off of the pace four wide and was done early.

Footnotes
UNAPOLOGETIC ME stalked two wide, vied for the lead two wide around the far turn, dug in turning for home to hold an advantage inside of GINNY B while
her inner counterpart tired, then gamely fended off that foe through the lane and held tenaciously. GINNY B advanced from far off of the pace two to three
wide down the backstretch to be in range of the leaders into the far turn, split foes passing the five sixteenths pole before producing a three wide bid for the
lead turning for home, but was outdueled by her inner rival through the lane. SKYVALUE stalked along the inside, and then from the pocket around the far
turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch, but lacked a kick to make a bid outside of the dueling leaders, and chased those rivals home. NOBLE ALMA tracked
from midpack in the three to four path around the turns, but was outmoved by an inner rival approaching the quarter pole, then kept on through the lane
between horses for a minor reward. SILLY NOTION saved ground far off of the pace around the turn before shifting two wide turning for home, but failed to
get involved. CLAUDIA JEAN (IRE) set the pace along the inside, but was headed at the quarter pole, and weakened thereafter. TOOTSIE advanced four
wide down the backstretch to be in range of the leaders into the far turn, but flattened out five wide passing the five sixteenths pole, and weakened. MIS
ELAIN E US saved ground off of the pace, but was steadied along the inside at the furlong pole while weakening.
