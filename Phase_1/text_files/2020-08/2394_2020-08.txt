Footnotes
IRANISTAN went to the front, jumped extremely while well rated setting the clear pace, was headed by the runner-up into upper stretch, fought back gamely
to regain the lead inside the furlong marker and prevailed under a strong left-handed whip. MUST SEE THE DOC (GB) tracked the pace on the outside
while jumping well, turned up the pressure on the final turn, took a narrow advantage into upper stretch, lost the lead back to the winner inside the furlong
marker, fought under a strong hand ride to the wire and missed while well clear for the place then was vanned off after being walked onto the ambulance
after the gallop out. MACCABEE was hard held while jumping well, moved out leaving the first turn, raced outside under restraint, was asked in three path
on the final turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response but was well clear for the show. NEW MEMBER (IRE) was
taken under a strong hold, dropped to the inside after a half-mile then was rated on the inside, saved ground through the final turn, was asked at the top of
the stretch and came up empty. CRACKER FACTORY (GB) was a bit hesitant coming to fence one, saved ground while reserved towards the rear, was put
in tight against the inside marker coming to the final fence then dropped back and failed to respond. MUTASAAWY jumped well while off the pace and also
failed to respond. ELUCIDATION (IRE) raced on the outside while jumping okay, drifted out into the stretch for the final time and faltered. NO WUNDER
(GB) was reserved towards the rear, hit fence eight and never reached contention. SHOW COURT (IRE) struggled over fence four, raced near the rear, was
taken up after struggling badly over fence eight and was no factor.

Footnotes
NUTSIE got pulled away from troubled rivals at the start, saw the pilot resort to brisk encouragement afterwards and got going, out-muscled MALIBU LUNA
by bumping its way into the three path in time for the commencement of the run around the bend, was confidently ridden pressing the issue as the widest of
three until the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, got let out a notch in preparation for the stretch run springing from that station, challenged in earnest a
furlong down the road, forged to the lead by the beginning of the final furlong, gradually increased the margin, kept to urging to the end. MALIBU LUNA one
of two unscathed at the start, attained a forward position, got induced into taking the four path for entrance onto the turn after undergoing some contact with
the winner, sat poised keeping watch on the three front runner contending for the lead, swung four wide into the lane and was given her cue, displayed
willingness even though failing to cut into the deficit, completed the last few jumps in hand once the verdict no longer seemed in doubt. LUTESCOOT N
BOOGIE bumped with SAFE CONDUCT after bobbling inward at the start, recovered, disputed the pace from path two in between rivals on the turn, settled
onto the top of the lane and was turned loose, did battle for another furlong then weakened. SAFE CONDUCT was forced in for several jumps after suffering
contact with an incoming LUTESCOOT N BOOGIE, went on to take up the chase two wide in midpack, commenced the stretch slightly wider, made no
headway during the ensuing furlong, lugged in at intervals thereafter, leading the rider to counteract this tendency by applying pressure on the opposite side.
BUSTIN SHUFFLE secured the top after stumbling badly at the start, cut over to the inside route, vied as the innermost of three from the half mile pole to
upper stretch, folded. BOSS BEAR steadied after the break to avoid becoming part of a bumping incident, saved ground until the quarter pole, angled out
five wide from upper to midstretch, came up empty. COMMAND CENTRAL two wide stepping onto the turn, was sent out five wide into the lane, had no rally
while trailing almost throughout.

Footnotes
XANTHIQUE away well, attended the leader to the outside in the two path under reserve applying pressure through her presence without being pressed to
do so, remained patiently handled through the turn and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused straightened away, rallied to take
command a furlong from home, then inched away being flashed the stick to the off side to the finish to prevail. OLENDON (FR) briefly inside after the start,
tipped to the two path down the backstretch and tracked the pace from mid pack until tucked back inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under light coaxing
nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, was in behind a pair of rivals tepidly handled until roused near the eighth pole, tipped three wide
inside that station nudging ORIGINATOR lightly to the four path and improved position for the place honors while making no headway on the winner.
ORIGINATOR three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got set down continuing three wide for home, dug in under a drive and was nudged lightly to the
four path inside the eighth pole by the aforementioned foe, then kept on to secure the show honors. KITTEN'S COVERGIRL established the front and
showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits under some pressure from the presence of XANTHIQUE to the outside, cut the corner into
upper stretch, got let out at the three-sixteenths under challenge, yielded the front a furlong from home and weakened in the late stages. TURF WAR three
wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled four wide into upper stretch and came up empty. LOST TICKET
two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along five-sixteenths out, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
HEIRLOOM KITTEN was hustled to the front, went around the first turn in the two path, showed the way through moderate fractions, vied inside to the two
path on the far turn, was asked to pick it up late on that bend, responded well when put to a right-handed whip at the top of the stretch, drew off into the final
furlong and proved much the best under steady urging. FIRST RATE was restless in the gate then sent hard from the start, rounded the first turn in the two
path, settled at the rear down the backstretch, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, came between horses into the far turn, was ridden along in the
three path on that bend, came under the whip outside the quarter-pole, dropped to the two path into the stretch and finished willingly for the place. BLOOD
MOON had two shoes repaired in the paddock, was hustled from the start, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace, came
under urging with a half-mile to run, chased inside early on the far turn then moved to the two path, turned into the stretch under the whip and weakened
while clear for the show. GRIT AND GLORY went four then three wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, came under encouragement while four
wide on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. BOBBYFROMTHEPALM broke a step slow, went two then three
wide under restraint on the first turn, was reserved on the outside at the rear, moved out inside the three-quarter pole then advanced midway down the
backstretch, was asked near the half-mile pole, vied three wide under urging on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch under the whip and capitulated.
NAUGHTY PRINCE went three then two wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path while between horses coming to
the three-eighths pole, dropped back passing the five-sixteenths and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
ROBIN SPARKLES retained the advantage after breaking on top, got guided over to the inside route, showed the way, prompted by NEW YORK
SUPREME out in the two path, stepped into the lane with none having latched on yet, responded when asked for more right around the three-sixteenths
pole, scampering away to lead by its largest margin with a furlong to go, maintained that healthy advantage, kept to some encouragement to the wire.
BONUS BABY along the outside on the backstretch, slid over to the hedge after leaving the half mile pole, vacated the premises and swung four wide into
the lane, straightened away, proved no match securing second. DREAM CHASING worked out a tuck onto the inside at the top of the turn, tracked the front
runners within striking distance, was roused spinning into the two path for entrance into the stretch, got outfinished. SHE SO NAUGHTY sighted pulling on
the bit getting maneuvered over to the inside on the backstretch, ventured onward along it, continuing to fight the bit at times, stepped into the lane, was
worked into path five in the final furlong, showed enough stretch run to earn the last major check. PRAIRIE TALES struck the right side of the starting gate,
settled along the inside by the conclusion of the backstretch, tipped out two wide at the head of the stretch, made no impact. NEW YORK SUPREME
disputed the pace from path two, fighting the rider until a short distance from the end of the bend, shifted into path three when set down entering the stretch,
gave way. FRENCHIE FROU FROU sluggish at the start, went on to ride the hedge to no avail. SMOKIN HOT KISS two wide at the top of the turn, was
closer to the inside at the top of the lane, never made its presence felt. VINDA MACHINE travelled two to three wide on the turn, failed to menace. BIG RED
GIRL three wide onto the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wider, had no offering.

Footnotes
MISS MARISSA coaxed from the gate to the front, showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits, came under light coaxing near the
quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home roused for the stretch drive, edged away under a drive to prevail in Bill Daly fashion. RISKY MANDATE
tracked the pace just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. FOXTAIL coaxed from the gate, raced three wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide placed to
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. INDY UNION saved ground at the tail of the field, grew detached midway down
the backstretch, tipped three wide through the far turn getting put to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and made no
headway. OFF TOPIC three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into
upper stretch, never got involved and was eased through the final eighth.

Footnotes
IT'S A GAMBLE was off slow and spotted the front just over two lengths, raced at the rear under urging, moved closer while saving ground on the turn, was
roused while cutting the corner against the hedge into the stretch, pursued the runner-up along the hedge into the final furlong then tipped out, displayed a
huge burst of acceleration into the final sixteenth and closed with a rush to get up under excellent handling. THIN WHITE DUKE was sent hard to the lead,
set the pace in the two path, responded well when asked at the top of the stretch, was put to a right-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths, remained clear
under the whip into the final sixteenth but was denied while well clear for the place. I'M BLAMING YOU brushed with foes on both sides at the start and was
off a step slow, raced on the outside while hard ridden near the back, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch under the whip,
remained on his inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed kick while just up for the show. DANZIGWITHTHESTARS moved in while off the pace,
angled towards the rail late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was roused behind horses into upper stretch, came under the whip
around the furlong marker and weakened then lost the show. STRONG DESIRE settled off the pace, was roused while three to four wide on the turn, came
five wide into the stretch under the whip, remained on his inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed response. CHARGEMYDINNER brushed with a foe
at the start, moved in while off the pace, drafted near the inside on the turn, tipped out while asked at the top of the stretch, chased the winner into the final
furlong and tired. CHULAINN was urged along on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, altered out from behind horses inside the
three-sixteenths, shifted further out inside the furlong marker and failed to rally. BUSTIN BIEBER brushed with a foe just after the start while sent hard,
chased the pace, went around the turn in the three path, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated. TOM'S CHOICE broke in and hit the gate then
brushed with a rival, chased the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the four path and came up empty. DAGGERBOARD brushed with a
rival at the start, angled in towards the rear, went around most of the turn in the two path, shifted four wide inside the five-sixteenths, moved out in upper
stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BRAY away last, sat reserved two wide for the opening six furlongs, swung into action by getting fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, kicked
into his best, tussled with the runner up in the final seventy yards and gamely got the job done. MANDATE pursued the pace from path two during the initial
stages, travelled three wide on the far turn, angled towards path four heading home, chipped away at the deficit, struck the front with approximately a
sixteenth to go, did battle with the winner shortly afterwards, was determined to the end but wound up denied. OPERATIVE rode the hedge around the
clubhouse bend, slipped to the outside and went on to prompt the pace on turn two towards path two, was approximately three wide challenging in earnest
coming into the stretch, out-fought some stubborn rivals to emerge at the eighth pole possessing a slim lead, relinquished to heavy pressure a sixteenth or
so later, stayed on for the show. MITZRAYIM put to a firm hold, cut over to the inside route after establishing control, ventured towards the three path
leading the way on the backstretch though before moving back to the inside at the half mile pole, came under siege stepping onto the top of the lane,
relinquished deep into the furlong grounds and weakened. THE SINNER IS YOU took up the chase at or near the inside route for over three-quarters, was
wedged between rivals putting in his best shot from upper to midstretch, got staved off. QUIET OUT EAST rode the hedge, was being roused inching up on
the second bend, cut the corner into the lane tightly placed on the inside route, flattened out.

Footnotes
NEWLY MINTED bobbled slightly at the break, raced four paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the turn coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four then three wide straightened away into upper stretch, took over command straightened away, came in
under an off sided stick to the rail inching away to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat placed to a near sided stick and came out forcing
RATAJKOWSKI to steady a sixteenth from home, then held on from a closing trio to prevail. MRS. ORB struck the off side stall at the start, chased six paths
off the inside down the backstretch at the tail of the field, tucked three to four wide put to coaxing at the half mile pole, advanced through the turn and went
five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining through the final furlong but ultimately missed at the end. FOREVER CHANGED
bobbled at the break recovering inwards fortunate that RATAJKOWSKI was away a beat slow, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a mild bid to just get the head bob on the wire for the show
honors. COLLEGEVILLE GIRL chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, got coaxed along three
furlongs from home, went three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. RATAJKOWSKI broke a beat slow and altered out as FOREVER
CHANGED took over her lane recovering inwards from a bobble, raced five paths off the inside just off the leader, tucked three wide through the turn and
advanced mildly outside the top pair coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five then four wide into upper stretch straightened away, dug in
under a drive chasing the leader home from the two path through to the finish steadily whittling away when forced to a pronounced steady at the sixteenth
marker breaking all momentum as NEWLY MINTED came out under a near sided stick at that station just as she was being latched onto, and could not
recover to the finish. CARRERA CAT established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked closer to the rail through the turn and
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under challenge for the initial time, spun just off the inside for home, yielded the front straightened away and tired.
There was a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the incident at the sixteenth marker before the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
DATA ANALYTICS went to the front while pulling under tight restraint, showed the way in the two path through solid fractions, responded well when asked
at the quarter-pole, extended the advantage into the final furlong and proved best under a solid hand ride while being flagged with the whip. DANCING KIKI
settled on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch and narrowly earned the place while no match for the
winner. VIVAZANO broke out and bumped with a rival, was taken under a tight hold approaching the first turn, went around that bend in the two path, was
rated just off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased into the final furlong, came out some late and was out-kicked
then lost the place while narrowly able to get the show. PURE BODE was reluctant to load, went around the first turn in the three path, stalked the pace on
the outside, was asked while three wide on the far turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and tired then just lost the show. MASTEROF THE
TUNES was bumped on both sides at the start then taken up while shut-off, moved in while placed under a tight hold early, rounded the first turn in the two
path under tight restraint, was reserved towards the rear, moved closer late on the backstretch then steadied along the hedge under tight restraint at the
three-eighths, continued under a tight hold through the far turn, was asked while cutting the corner into the stretch then chased behind foes, moved to the
two path then waited while boxed in from the eighth-pole to just before the wire and lost all chance. TWO CENT TOOTSIE bumped with a rival at the start,
went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, went four wide on the far turn, was given her cue inside the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive into
the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. CHOCOLATE COOKIE broke in at the start then bumped with a rival, shied out while inside of a foe nearing the
first turn then was asked to keep her mind on business by the rider, raced inside to the two path on that bend, settled well off the pace, departed the
backstretch tightly between horses, went two to three wide on the far turn then spun four wide into the stretch, was driven between horses into the final
furlong and failed to threaten. PORTOFINA broke a bit awkwardly, went three wide on the first turn, settled in the back half of the field, started the far turn in
the three path then moved to five wide under urging and failed to rally. SAINTE MERE EGLISE went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was
roused while three to four wide on the far turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond. FAVORITE IMPULSE was off slow then came
inward while leaving the gate, saved ground on the first turn, settled last but one, started the far turn in the three path, shifted five then six wide under urging
near the five-sixteenths and was no factor. TABULA RASA broke a step slow, went two to three wide on the turns, came out into upper stretch and showed
little. LEMONCELLA was hard held while rank into the first turn, went around that bend in the three path, was rated off the pace, came under urging in the
two path on the far turn and faltered.
