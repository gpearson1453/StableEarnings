raced in mid pack, chased three to five-wide on the turn, rallied willingly and was up late for place. UNCLE HOWARD dueled along the rail, yielded a furlong
out and chased to the end, giving up the place late. STEEL WOOL, bumped at the start, raced in striking range, closed four-wide late turn but evened out in
the late stages. JOIN THE CLUB was off slowly and settled in mid pack, came two to four-wide through the turn then finished with some interest.
SLIPSHOD, away slowly and well back early, was hustled along the rail and two-wide on the turn then tendered a mild rally. TRINITY THUNDAH stalked the
pace from the rail but flattened out in the final 16th. CEPELINAS broke outward and bumped STEEL WOOL, raced in range three-wide, chased two-wide
late turn but evened out in the final furlong. HENRYTHEEIGHTH stalked the pace, dropped back late turn and lacked a rally.

through the turn then rallied gamely between foes. SILENT JET raced in mid pack, came three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished
gamely. MAS CHIKILIN stalked the pace, raced two-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. WHERE'S ANTHONY stalked the pace, but was

Footnotes
JOY'S ROCKET had speed, set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch and was kept to business for the win. ROAD TO ROMANCE stalked
the pace, chased hard three-wide late turn and finished all out. ROTARY was steadied in tight quarters just out and settled off the pace, closed two to
four-wide through the turn then rallied willingly. EMMELINE lost her path at the outset, settled in mid pack, was hustled on the backstretch and turn then
finished evenly. ROCKET RELOAD broke outward, forced the pace, chased into the stretch but flattened out in the final 16th. QUEEN RHONDA got off
slowly and settled well back, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, cut to the rail at the top of the stretch but never reached contention.
SILENT MAMBA was in range early, dropped back along the rail on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
IVYLEA bumped with BOSCOBEL at the start, raced in mid pack, closed angling from two to five-wide through the far turn, bid a furlong out and drove clear.
YASINIA, bumped by MISS EVANGELINE at the start, in turn bumped GIANT SONET then settled in mid pack, chased three to six-wide on the far turn and
rallied gamely. CALL HER JOEY got away slowly, raced in mid pack, bid into the far turn, edged clear late turn but was caught a furlong out and chased to
the end. SWEET SHADES, off slowly, raced in mid pack, closed two and three-wide on the far turn then chased gamely through the stretch. BOSCOBEL
bumped with IVYLEA at the outset and settled off the pace, raced along the rail and two-wide through the final turn, failed to menace but closed with some
interest. MISS EVANGELINE bumped YASINIA leaving the gate, stalked the pace, bid into the far turn, was headed late turn and evened out in the final
furlong. DEARFUTUREHUSBAND had speed, was joined then headed at the 1st turn, stalked, bid into the far turn, dueled, was headed late turn and had no
closing response. GIANT SONET, bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail on the turn but never reached contention. FIVE
SPARROWS raced off the pace, saved ground but was never in contention. BEAT THE RUSH, away slowly and off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the
far turn but lacked a rally. AUDITION took command on the first turn, set the pace, was caught near the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
LEA RO was in the scramble for the early lead before taking back and stalking the early duelers, advanced two to four wide into contention turning for home,
bid an eighth out and collared the front runner at the sixteenth pole, holding a closer safe in the final yards. MARIPOSA BELLE broke out at the start and
dropped in from the three path into the first turn to the rail, rallied nicely but had to check off heels while still inside on the far turn, angled out when room
finally developed turning for home and closed resolutely in the final eighth. A LITTLE VOODOO was rank while four to three wide challenging for the front
around the first turn, dueled with a rival down the backside, headed that one as they turned for home but lost the lead by the sixteenth pole, tiring in the final
stages. BUTTERED TOAST was allowed to fall back early, angled out down the backstretch and circled widest (five wide) on the far turn, closing well on the
outside down the stretch to best the balance. SAMANTHA'S JOY was three wide throughout and in mid pack, stayed in contention to late on the far turn and
seemed to fall back in upper stretch, but re-rallied in the final eighth. BORN TO BE GOOD battled between rivals in the early going, dropped back to chase
the duelers, stayed in contention until the eighth pole but wilted from there to the wire. SING YOUR LIFE was in mid pack along the rail and in range into the
stretch but had no late kick. BLAZING BOURBON was inside three rivals for the lead early, dueled with the eventual third place finisher down the
backstretch and around the far turn, dropping back in the stretch. QUEEN ANDHER COURT was off the pace early, rallied between foes on the far turn but
could not sustain her bid in the stretch. HIDDEN STARLET was steadied at the start and fell off the pace, rallying mildly into the far turn but never in it.
STARDUST KITTEN broke sluggishly and trailed the field most of the way.

FORESTER'S TURN dueled from the rail, drove clear mid stretch and held under steady pressure. FORESTER'S FORTUNE stalked the pace from the rail,
came out and bumped ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS at the top of the stretch then finished under a determined drive. ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS stalked the pace
two and three-wide, was bumped at the top of the stretch, angled out a bit and chased to the end. CELEBRATORY dueled two-wide, was headed mid
stretch and gave way grudgingly. LAST AMERICAN EXIT settled well off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn, tipped out upper stretch and rallied
belatedly. BARILKO raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but had no closing response.

Footnotes
OLLIEMYBOY, away slowly, settled off the pace, closed three and four-wide on the far turn, challenged in the final furlong, gained command and finished
under a hand ride. BELICHICK, off slowly, closed four then three-wide on the far turn, dueled into the stretch but was passed in the final furlong but held
place. RED STORM RISEN had speed, dueled, wore down one rival, was quickly engaged by another and when passed by the winner was outfinished for
place. HOLYFIELD, in range, was hustled on the far turn then closed gamely through the stretch. AWESOME WOK N ROLL was steadied at the start,
settled off the pace, angled six-wide late on the far turn then rallied outside. MALIBU EDGE settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn,
chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. GREEK GEEK was hustled in range on the backstretch, came three and four-wide through
the turn but evened out in the final 16th. LION KINGDOM raced in mid pack, was hustled two to five-wide on the far turn but failed to menace. STRIKE THE
TOP settled off the pace, was hustled hard three to five-wide on the far turn then evened out in the final 16th. FIFTH SEASON, in mid pack early, saved
ground on the far turn but lacked a closing response. MALAHINI settled in mid pack, enjoyed a rail trip on the turns, chased two-wide into the stretch but
lacked a closing response. U S ARMY CORPS led quickly, dueled from the first turn, gave way late on the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
ARTISTICO settled off the pace while on hold early, rallied into traffic on the far turn and had to await room for a quarter mile, angled rail to three wide
turning for home and found a seam by the three sixteenths pole, drawing off in the final sixteenth. THEREGOESJOJO was crowded at the start and rated off
the pace while two to three wide on the first turn, came with a four to five run around the second turn and fanned out to the eight path turning for home,
outkicked by the winner but clearly second best while widest down the lane. PEACE OF EKATI settled in mid pack, rallied four wide on the far turn to have
dead aim on the leaders in upper stretch, bid at the three sixteenths pole but was outkicked by the top pair, settling for the show spot. ENGLISH CLASSIC
settled into a nice tracking trip behind the two front runners, angled into the three path to take them on turning for home and had a brief lead in upper stretch
but was outkicked to the wire by the top trio. BURNING MAN off the pace early, moved up menacingly inside behind the front runners as the field turned for
home and got a split in upper stretch but was outrun in the final furlong. ENGLISH ILLUSION was pinched back at the start and two to three wide around the
first turn while off the pace, advanced three to four wide from the rear of the field while being asked, followed the place finisher into the stretch in the seven
path but could not match that one's energy, passing a few tired foes in the final eighth. CAMP CREEK off the pace and three to four wide on the first turn,
near the rear while under restraint down the backstretch, advanced down the inside in the stretch but levelled off in the final furlong.
MAMBOINTHEFOREST was off the pace and two to four wide around the first turn, rallied along the rail on the second turn and down the lane to pass a few
stragglers without threatening. HUNGARY broke in impeding two rivals at the start, sped quickly to the front, stayed on the engine but well off the rail down
the backside, was headed by a pace buddy late on the far turn and faded in the final furlong. TALLESTOFTHETALL settled in mid pack along the inside,
was asked for best midway on the far turn but had no response. ITSTARTSWITHADRINK raced in mid pack, stayed in range three wide until midway non
the far turn when backing up through rivals commenced. COLEYVILLE stalked the early leader until bidding around the far turn, had a brief lead as they
turned for home but faded out of it, noticeably dropping back in the final furlong. SHANGASSAH trailed throughout.
