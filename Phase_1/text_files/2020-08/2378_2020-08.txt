Footnotes
ABOGADA was off the pace, moved to contend on the far turn, was roused mid turn and ran down the leader to clear off in the final furlong. MISS VICKI got
to the lead on the first turn, led under mild restraint, was caught by the winner at the eighth pole but ran on to hold second. FLASHY PATCH chased outside
and lost position in upper stretch. HONEST GINGER was last early, had some rallly on the turn to improve position, and gained mildly late. HAUTE
PROSPECT reared, hit the gate at the start with the rider losing both irons, ran very wide on the track while staying even, and managed to pass a fader late.
TICKET TO RICHES chased inside, was left behind on the turn, faded and was passed by a horse with a rider that lost his irons..

Footnotes
DOLLY DEAR bumped a horse at the start, chased a solo leader, rallied outside to engage that one on the turn, got by to lead at the three sixteenths pole
and kept on well to hold sway late. GRADUATEWITHHONORS bumped a foe at the start, raced up close, went in the four path on the turn and had good
energy late for second while unable to impact the winner. OHIO SILVER was wide on the backstretch, went five wide on the turn and had good run to the
sixteenth pole before evening out. STORMY JUSTICE needed more on the turn, but managed to keep fourth. ADVENTURE LAND led comfortably, vied
with the winner from the turn to upper stretch and flattened out at the eighth pole. HEAVENLY MINE had an awkward start, veered several gate positions
inside, was left behind and posed no threat. HIGHLY VISIBLE was not involved.

LA COYOTA pressed the pace outside a horse to the turn, was taken on again inside by another foe to deep stretch, got the lead and evened out late but
managed to stay on for the win. PROMISED FAME moved up on the turn to pressure the leader from outside, dueled to late stretch but evened out and
settled for place. BACKSEAT PROMISES was bounced between horses at the starrt, raced at the rear of a tight field, rallied in the three path on the turn,
angled to the rail in the stretch, loomed late but could only gain slowly past the sixteenth pole. TEMPLEMENT raced midpack in a bunched group, drifted out
and got floated out down the stretch and lost position late. SWEET CARLI bumped a foe at the start and needed more on the turn. JIMA'S GOLD had a
pressured run between horses but was shuffled back on the turn and had no recovery.

HYGH I. Q. was off slow, rushed to turn, stayed game in the stretch run to reel in leader at the wire in a good effort. MIGHTY ANGEL rushed to the lead,
cleared off into the stretch under heavy urging to get to wire but was reeled in late. FRANK THE TANK lunged at the start and lost best chance, swung
widest past the quarter pole and finished with a late rush to garner the show spot. NEW YORK ONE saved ground throughout with no late bid in the stretch
run. INSOFAR quick start outside, stayed close outside with no late kick when needed. KISSIN ALEX never a factor. HARBOR BOY never far back off rail to
quarter pole with nothing left into the stretch run and stopped.

Footnotes
SUCCOTASH was mid pack, quickly closed a gap toward the leader on the turn, tussled with that one and took over at the eighth pole. BISCAYNE BAY
bumped a horse at the start, tracked just off the leader, took over on the turn, was fought by the winner from mid turn to the eighth pole and ended up
second best. TICKET OUT broke inward and lost a step at the start, waited off the pace, gave chase on the turn and advanced steadily down the stretch for
third. POWER BANKER raced in front off the rail, lost the lead mid turn, lost touch with the top two runners but stayed even down the lane giving up third
late. LOVELY LADY LINDA was bounced between horses at the start, raced mid pack and remained even throughout. SUNSHINE SEEKER was bumped at
the start, lost a step, went very wide on the backstretch and very wide in the stretch, posing no threat. KAYLEE'S HOPE was not a threat. NANA ROZE was
not a factor. VAQUERITA was up close off the rail for the first quarter and dropped back on the turn.
