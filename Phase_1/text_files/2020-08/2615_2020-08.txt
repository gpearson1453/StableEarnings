Footnotes
LOVE AND LEMONS dueled from the inside for the early margin, battled through the turn, shook loose entering the drive, opened a clear margin at the
eighth pole and held sway. IMAJIMMYCREED stalked the early pace from the outside, advanced through the turn, responded when asked but could not
reach the winner. PROPHETESS WISDOM dueled from between foes early, remained engaged through the turn but could not keep pace in the drive. MISS
PAR T chased the early pace from the inside, made a bid but was too late. SEASIDE SURPRISE dueled from the outside and tired in the drive. PALEEZE
was never close. WISE WOMAN was never a factor.

Footnotes
VITA stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the second turn, responded when sat down for the drive and steadily drew clear. I
DONT KNOW EITHER outrun early, advanced inside through the second turn, remained along the rail for the drive, lacked room at the eighth pole, angled
outside and just missed the place. BAD GAL RIRI unhurried early from the inside, steadily advanced through the second turn, responded entering the drive,
gained a clear margin at the eighth pole but could not last. LADY KING broke awkward from between foes, chased the early pace up the backstretch,
advanced outside through the second turn, responded and rallied but too late. GLITTER TIME dueled from the inside early, chased the pace up the
backstretch but came up empty in the drive. DEVASTATING BEAUTY forced the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn,
responded entering the drive but could not sustain the effort. X MINUS ONE dueled from the outside early, gained a clear margin up the backstretch,
remained clear through the second turn then tired in the drive. SHEZAONE was never a factor. SIDE SWING forced the early pace and faded. ULTIMATE
CHALLENGE was finished after going a half.

Footnotes
MILA'S GOLD stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn,
responded when sat down for the drive and inched clear late. WILDABOUT AUDREY dueled from between foes for the early margin, remained engaged up
the backstretch, gained a clear margin through the second turn, drifted out mid stretch bothering DUEPEG at the eighth pole then lasted for the place. After
a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey's Objection WILDABOUT AUDREY was disqualified for interference at the eighth pole. DUEPEG chased the early pace from
the outside, inched closer entering the second turn, held a striking position entering the drive, was steadied at the eighth pole when WILDABOUT AUDREY
drifted out and held the show. TOODALOO TO YOU outrun early, advanced inside through the second turn, responded but was too late. LEBKUCHEN
chased the early pace outside but had nothing for the drive. OUR AMEN was never a factor. CUSTOM CUT dueled from the inside and faded. LOVE
BOUND forced the early pace outside and gave way.

Footnotes
KATAMA BAY dueled from between foes early, remained engaged through the turn, shook loose entering the drive and was well clear while never roused.
RICH ICON forced the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the drive, responded along the rail and was up for the place. FAVORITE SON
dueled from the outside early, battled through the turn but could not keep pace in the drive. SUPER INTENSE chased the early pace outside, advanced
through the turn but could only hold position. CHAN MAN went evenly. SILKY'S DANCE reared at the start and could only improve position. COCO AMOD
was no factor. LOOK HAPPY was no threat. CARTERJAMESLOVE had a steady fade. PREACHER was no menace. Half mile split time unavailable due to
a timer malfunction.
