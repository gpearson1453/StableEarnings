Footnotes
ILIKEROLLIN pressed the pace, took a narrow lead by the five-sixteenths going three wide on the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch but quickly
reasserted himself, dug in to hold sway over MICKEYS GOLD, who pursued the pace from outside, went five wide on the turn, engaged the leader at the top
of the stretch but was unable to kick on with that one while clearly second best. WHISKEY LAUGH CAT exchanged a bump at the start, chased from
between foes, went four wide on the turn, had no extra for the drive and was best of the rest. MR. MCFEELY set the pace with outside pressure, went on or
just off the rail on the turn, came up empty. CLABBERS WIN tracked off the leaders inside, saved ground on the turn, came out entering upper stretch then
again in mid-stretch. FARMER FRED R F trailed early while well removed from the inside, went in the five path on the turn, was carried out in mid-stretch.
MOJAZZ exchanged a bump at the start, chased from between foes for the opening quarter after some urging, dropped back three wide on the turn, was
pulled up in upper stretch and vanned off.

Footnotes
LAYCOCK BAY pressed from outside going three then moving clear and coming in a bit on the turn, drifted out leaving that bend and extending the
advantage then drifted again near the sixteenth pole but was clear and held safe. DAJUDGE settled outside a rival just off the leaders, went in the four path
on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch, could make no headway on the top one but was second best. KARAOKE CAT broke outwardly, tracked along
the inside, went in the two path on the turn, came out four deep into the stretch, kept on to get show honors over BUBBA NIGHTLINGER, who was bumped
after the start, switched out heading up the backstretch, went four to five wide and outside on the turn, was six wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed
late kick. WILL TELL vied inside the winner going from the two path to the rail on the turn and steadily weakened. I B EZ was forced out after the break and
bumped a rival, settled well back, went in the two then three path on the turn, came out five to six deep turning for home and made no bids. SHE THINKS IM
HOT raced outside, went three to four wide on the turn, floated seven deep into upper stretch, was not a threat.

Footnotes
COMIC HOT TODDY dueled outside a rival, went three then two wide on the turn, was in command by the quarter and shaken up soon thereafter,
responded and drew away. ATILL I CHIME broke a half-step slowly and was brushed at the break, recovered to stalk the leading pair from outside, went
four then three wide on the turn within striking distance, lugged in a bit in upper stretch, proved no match for the winner but second best. BULLY BABY
dueled inside the winner entering the turn just off the fence and moving a bit nearer it on that bend, could not keep pace despite asking past the quarter
pole, weakened a bit in the lane. FILL THE BILL broke outwardly and bumped a rival, tracked along the rail but was in tight quarters past the three-eighths
and dropped back a bit, shifted out four wide coming past the quarter pole, drifted out a bit in mid-stretch and ran on. SPEEDY WILDCAT bobbled and
steadied slightly at the start, altered inside a rival about the nine-sixteenths pole, tracked in behind off the fence to the turn entering the bend three wide,
was floated six wide past the quarter pole and ran on. INDIAN FIREBLOSSOM brushed the outer rival at the start, angled in after clearing the gap, went in
the two to three path on the turn and got up to share a minor placing. THE PACESETTER was away slowly and bumped at the start, lacked early speed
racing just off the rail through the turn, angled four wide turning into upper stretch and failed to threaten. OUR SOARING ANGEL chased briefly from
outside, dropped back five to six wide on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
TESTING THE WATERS settled in behind the leaders, switched off the rail to advance between rivals two wide past the quarter pole and take command,
was clear into upper stretch and kept to the task to hold sway. BATTLEFIELDMARSHAL shifted in from the four path to be three deep early on the turn then
again to follow the winner two wide out of that bend before coming out in upper stretch, could make no headway but held the place. DRIFTERS CHOICE
went three to five wide on the turn and gained mildly. NEW YORK PROUD switched out heading up the backstretch, went five to six wide on the turn,
altered inside the aforementioned foe at the head of the lane and evened out. KABULL shifted in leaving the backstretch, made a mild bid along the rail near
the quarter pole then flattened out. PALICE REVENGE stalked early then bid four wide and outside foes to take a narrow lead midway on the turn before
flattening out. WILD DANCER sped clear early racing well off the rail, moved in to the three path into the turn, dropped back from between rivals and tired.

Footnotes
DELBERT TOO switched out coming past the half-mile marker, went three to four wide on the turn, asked for run at the three-sixteenths, fanned six wide
outside of rivals into upper stretch, struck the lead past the furlong marker, was clear at the sixteenth and held from DIGGER'S GOLD, who settled into
stride, angled in at the three-eighths, went in the two path saving some ground through the turn before coming out in upper stretch, was gaining but too late.
CHEESE TRAY tracked inside, went mostly on the rail and then just off it on the turn before angling out leaving the bend, was five wide and between foes
when taken hold of briefly in upper stretch, shifted outside the winner and ran on. JORNALERO dueled inside a rival but off the fence before moving to the
rail early on the turn, lugged out leaving that bend at the head of the stretch, weakened thereafter. PUB went four to five wide on the turn and ran evenly.
SMOOTH BLUES stumbled badly at the start, raced on or just off the rail up the backstretch and on the turn, failed to threaten. AISLE RUNNER dueled
outside, was in a bit tight at the furlong marker between runners and gave way. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.
