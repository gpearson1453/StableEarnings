Footnotes
MISS B stalked two wide outside the early leader, moved to the front approaching the lane and held stubbornly after a long drive. CHIKARA settled, began a
run four wide into the far turn, drew even outside the winner in early stretch but wasn't enough. MY ROYAL ROCKET was unhurried inside, steadied nearing
the stretch while in tight three wide between rivals, closed between foes in midstretch and gained the show. FORMULA lagged early, circled into the stretch
and finished willingly outside. HEFFINGTON bobbled slightly leaving the gate, settled between rivals, raced three wide into the far turn, swung wide into the
stretch and improved position. SAILSINTHESUNSET raced three wide within striking distance to the stretch then tired. MS MEER angled to the inside with
the early lead, remained in command past the quarter pole then tired. FIERA PRADO was caught in tight between rivals for most of the final turn then
flattened out. RUN BALLERINA began to advance the rail on the backstretch, lacked room around the final turn then faded in the drive.

Footnotes
SHAHARAZAD was fractious in the gate, pressed in hand outside the early leader, moved two wide to the front early on the turn, drew out before six
furlongs and widened under urging. GOODNIGHTLOVING broke slowly, raced two wide between rivals around the turn and lacked a closing response.
LONE STAR LADY was slow early, edged out on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch with a run but failed to gain to the end and finished in a dead
heat for third. DARPA made the early pace along the rail while inside the winner, weakened in the lane and finished even for the show. TEN COUNT OUT
fell back from between rivals shortly after the break, raced wide into the stretch and passed tired ones. DUSTWHIRL WONDER stayed along the rail while
with the early pace, fell back nearing the turn and continued to fade. M AND M GIRL was fractious in the gate, broke slowly, advanced outside early, raced
three wide around the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
INSURRECTION settled, advanced two wide between horses around the turn, was bumped repeatedly while vying between horses through the lane, was
bumped into DISAPPROVAL in midstretch and prevailed. DISAPPROVAL came out three wide on the turn while moving, vied outside the winner into the
stretch, was bumped by that one while vying for command in midstretch and wasn't enough. PURE SPECULATION broke slowly, moved quickly in hand to
a clear lead, angled to the rail into the turn, drifted out into the winner while holding a short lead nearing the final sixteenth then tired. YOU SHOULD TALK
found best stride too late. MIDKNIGHTWAR rallied the rail around the turn while inside the winner, bore out under left hand whip, bumped that one
repeatedly through the lane, was taken up when squeezed between horses nearing the final sixteenth and faded. An objection by the rider of
MIDKNIGHTWAR against the winner was not allowed. CHARLIE'S SCHILLER chased early, was checked sharply two wide between horses nearing the
quarter pole then faded. BLAISING GUITAR was outrun. There was a stewards' inquiry into the events on the turn but the results stood.

Footnotes
WAPI settled inside, came out three wide while rallying around the final turn, took over from the outside in midstretch then drove clear. IN THE RED opened
a short lead soon after the break, edged clear along the inside before a half, remained clear into the final furlong, drifted out some and gave way.
QUICKPAY advanced along the rail into tight quarters nearing the end of the backstretch, lacked room around the final turn, angled out then back in to get
clear in early stretch but lacked the needed closing response. WEEKEND FUN pressed two wide outside the early leader for over three-quarters then tired.
R C KISS steadied in tight along the inside nearing the first turn, remained along the rail and flattened out in the lane. MARIA ELENA Y. G broke slowly,
stayed outside while unhurried, raced wide around the final turn and failed to matter. QUICK TRIP wasn't far back two wide on the outside early then tired.
NELLIE DEE steadied between rivals nearing the first turn then was outrun. QUEEN OF SHANGHAI raced two wide between rivals and stopped.

Footnotes
IMA DISCREET LADY stayed along the rail while in control and held stubbornly. CORLUNA settled, raced two wide between rivals around the final turn then
closed a gap through late stretch. SHES OUR FASTEST chased the pace, gave her best two wide between rivals around the final turn and weakened.
EMPRESSIVE REWARD wasn't far back early, saved ground around the final turn, continued inside through the lane but lacked the needed rally. JEWEL
STREET had early position three wide on the outside, moved closer on the final turn then lacked a further response. GEE SHE SPARKLES improved
position three wide around the final turn then flattened out. HERBS LOVE was slow early, raced the three path around the final turn and failed to menace.
VEILAZIG was outrun in the two path. GLITTER BRIGHT was outrun. STORM TRAFFIC was wide around the final turn while outrun.

Footnotes
REDATORY was rated along the rail while just behind the leaders, edged out three wide between horses for room while rallying into the stretch, bid into the
final furlong and was narrowly best. KENAI BOB pressed two wide outside the early leader, moved to a short lead midway on the final turn and gave way
grudgingly. SUNLIT SONG was unhurried inside, made a run two wide between horses into the stretch, gave his best in midstretch then flattened out.
MOOJAB JR was slow early, made a run around the final turn but couldn't gain through the lane. LETHAL MOVE was slow early, came out four wide on the
final turn and gained too late. RIGHT LANE LUKASZ stayed inside, moved closer into the stretch then flattened out. HE'S A SUITOR had early position
outside the winner, edged out four wide nearing the stretch and lacked a closing. BUBBA BLING was no factor. GOLD PILOT was outrun. TRUMPS
REVENGE took command soon after the break, showed the way for about three-quarters then stopped. Fractional times unavailable due to a teletimer
malfunction.
