Footnotes
PAPA MAMBO threw her head at the start while breaking slowly, was quickly collected, then angled in to split rivals just off the inside to bid for the lead
nearest the rail approaching the three furlong marker, skirmished for command through the turn, then edged forward racing through the lane while being
kept to firm right handed pressure. BRECHIN'S COMMAND broke readily to gain terms with a rival on the pace, was eased off that foe racing through the
backstretch tracking just off the first flight, shifted out four wide on the turn while being prompted to advance, then continued willingly in that path to close the
gap late while edging rivals narrowly for the place honors. COUNCIL RULES was urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail in the opening stages, dueled for
command between foes through the turn to upper stretch and weakened in late stages. SAUCY AT MIDNIGHT tracked off the first flight nearest the rail in
the opening stages, was held up avoiding tight quarters approaching the bend, saved ground to the lane and continued with interest to regain some position
while outkicked for a share. BONNET was rated outside foes in the opening stages, shifted out five wide while being prompted to advance after the opening
furlong, pressed the pace three wide between foes into the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
GOTHAM CITY QUEEN stumbled at the start, was quickly righted while being urged to a forward placing, made a steady advance on the pacesetter racing
into the bend, took over entering the lane and widened under pressure. HADDY UP broke sharply, set the pace on a clear margin along the inside racing
into the turn, proved no match when confronted by the winner nearing upper stretch but was best of the others. ORTS DREAM, a bit outpaced despite some
pressure in early stages, gradually drew into contention while shifting out four wide racing into the lane and continued with some late interest to prevail for a
share. SWEET AS CANBE angled to the rail in early stages, tracking just off the off leaders, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick.
GREY WAVE settled out of striking distance near the inside racing to the turn, shifted out three wide entering the lane while racing in close quarters but
offered no rally. BINDING TIME, urged to a forward placing three wide tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance, shifted inwards nearing the lane
and gave out in the closing stages.

Footnotes
HEIGHTEN, caught five wide in the opening stages tracking off the first flight, angled inwards nearing the turn advancing on the leaders, split rivals three
wide leaving the midway point of the turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch while being prompted to challenge, drifted to the six path in the closing
stages but kicked away to a clear advantage under right handed pressure, then was observed to be bleeding from the mouth when returning to be
unsaddled. FACING NORTH broke readily, pressed the pace between foes from the outset into the turn, dueled past midstretch but couldn't contain the
winner while narrowly prevailing for the place honors. LILFEATHEREDINDIAN, off a step slowly, was urged inside rivals pressing the pace through the
backstretch into the turn, shifted out entering upper stretch and weakened late. TRIPLE MALT settled last near the inside racing to the turn, swung out four
wide entering the lane and made some belated progress between foes to the close the gap. PARTY LIGHTS tracked just off the first flight four wide in the
opening stages, angled to the rail racing through the turn while drawing into striking distance, lodged a brief bid inside rivals when presented an opening
upper stretch but flattened out late. SWEET SASSAFRASSY joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, drifted out racing through the turn and soon
gave way.

ANGELINA'S HEAVEN broke readily, was urged inside foes disputing the pace into the first turn, sprinted clear along the rail into the backstretch, held sway
on a clear margin and maintained a safe advantage to the end under firm handling. SHE MIGHT TELL was rated off the first flight while angling inside racing
into the first turn, steadily gained position inside foes into the far turn, shifted out racing through the stretch and proved best of the others. VIVA FOREVER,
caught four wide racing into the first turn tracking just off the second flight, was prompted to advance outside foes into the far turn and continued with
interest to gain some position. FAIRLY HONEST, urged between foes into the first turn tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, continued between
rivals to the far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. FLATOUTCOUNTRY tracked the pacesetter three wide between foes to the backstretch and came
up empty racing through the far turn. MIZZEN AIR reared at the start losing her rider. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN

Footnotes
IRISH HALO, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide on the far turn and produced a steady late response to wrest the
advantage in time. TEMPLES MON CHERI was rated outside foes in second flight, swung out five wide racing into the lane and prevailed for second.
TURQUOISE TRAIL, forwardly placed between foes stalking the pacesetter, moved to take over racing into upper stretch but proved no match for the
winner. DO YOU BILEVE was rated off the first flight to the backstretch, was held up when caught in tight quarters between foes midway through the far
turn, angled inside foes entering the lane and finished evenly late. MUWAAN MAT, urged to terms with the first flight into the first turn, bore out midway
through that bend, was righted to make brief pursuit of the leaders four wide to the far turn and gave way. TIMBER LADY settled along the inside early, was
prompted to advance along the rail on the far turn, steadied out of tight quarters nearing upper stretch and had no further response. AVIE'S PARADISE,
urged to the lead inside foes, set the pace on a narrow margin racing into the far turn and gave way into the lane. BRAHMS IS WHO, urged to a forward
placing three wide, pressed the pace between foes to the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
WESTA WAVERLY broke readily, was urged to the lead three deep in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage outside WELL PRO
through the turn, shifted out entering the lane while being roused to resist that rival and edged forward late under firm encouragement. The latter was urged
inside foes prompting the pace in the opening stages, pressed the winner along the rail into the stretch but proved only second best. PASSTHECAT broke
sharply, pursued the leaders racing a bit off the rail into the turn and finished evenly late while prevailing for a share. OWEN'S PLEASURE, shuffled a bit in
early stages, switched outside foes racing into the turn while being prompted to advance, was carried out five wide by a rival who was drifting out markedly
nearing the lane but continued with an effort to improve position. SHAKELAS DESTINY was settled along the inside, then held up avoiding close quarters
with a half mile to go, switched out splitting rivals on the turn to gain some position into the lane but had no closing bid. MINNESOTA NICE made brief
pursuit of the leaders four wide into the turn and gave way into the lane. C D THUNDER tracked the leaders outside foes in the opening stages, bore out
markedly racing through the turn impeding a rival and proved no threat. CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE angled to the inside early and soon retreated.

HOTASAPISTOL, forwardly placed tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance to the backstretch, angled to the rail midway through the far turn
gradually drawing into striking distance, came through inside foes to wrest command and edged forward to prevail while fully extended. RUSH HOUR
TRAFFIC, bumped at the start, was urged along the rail prompting the pacesetter into the first turn, conceded the lead entering the backstretch to track just
off that rival, shifted to the three path while being urged to challenge racing into upper stretch and continued grudgingly between foes to the end while failing
to contain the winner. RENTAL POOL, held up in early stages, switched out to gain three wide between foes on the backstretch, swung out four wide
nearing the lane and lacked the needed final kick while prevailing for a share. DEFEND THE ROSE broke in bumping RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC, was urged
forcing the pace outside that foe racing into the first turn, went clear into the backstretch, held sway on a clear margin to upper stretch but faltered
midstretch. IMMINENT THREAT angled to the inside early tracking the leaders out of striking distance, saved ground throughout and gained some position
in an even effort. DREAMING OF BLUE settled last early, swung outside foes nearing the lane but made no impression. MADISONIAN settled outside foes
racing to the backstretch and dropped out early. STYLIN N PROFILIN angled in to track the leaders between foes but faded early. THE RACE WAS HAND
TIMED.

Footnotes
NORTHERN PLAYBOY was rated along the inside as part of the second flight, was prompted to make a steady advance along the rail racing into the far
turn, drove through inside the pacesetter racing into upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. LOVE MY BOSS, reserved off the second
flight in the opening half, steadily gained position along the inside racing into the far turn, switched just outside the eventual winner midway through the far
turn, was steadied out of tight quarters while exchanging contact with several rivals entering upper stretch but was righted in time to prevail for the place
honors. PUBLIC SAFETY, urged between foes prompting the pace into the first turn, tracked off the pacesetter into the backstretch, was urged to advance
three deep lodging a brief bid nearing upper stretch, was bumped entering the lane and came up empty late. BIG FALCON ROCKET, urged along the rail
pressing into the first turn pace, shifted out after a half and gave way racing into the lane. DEVIL VISION settled between foes in early stages and improved
position along the inside while no real threat. LIL' NINJA made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide to the backstretch and emptied out early. WHERE'D
THE DAY GO, reserved three, then four wide between foes to the backstretch, proved no threat. MYNAMEIS PRINCE, caught five wide through the first
turn to the backstretch, proved no threat. WEEKEND RIDE drifted out while being prompted to lead racing into the first turn, was urged clear into the
backstretch, set the pace through the far turn, emptied out nearing upper stretch while shifting out bumping PUBLIC SAFETY and abruptly gave way.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE TRAINER OF LOVE MY BOSS LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN
UPPER STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

DROP OF GOLDEN SUN went readily to the lead racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin a bit off the rail to the far turn, then held
sway through the lane under firm right handed pressure. HOT SHOT KID tracked the pacesetter outside rivals as part of the second flight to the backstretch,
couldn't close the gap on the winner racing into the lane but edged a rival for second in late stages. CINCO STAR tracked just off the pacesetter along the
inside to the backstretch, lodged a brief bid nearing the lane but faded in late stages. DAME PLATA, in touch between foes in the second flight early, was
rated off the second flight while angling inside on the backstretch, swung out racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. FIREMAN OSCAR
was rated just off the second flight racing four wide to the backstretch but faded early.

READY TO RUNAWAY broke readily, angled inwards racing to the first turn dictating the pace on a narrow advantage under rating, held sway to the far
turn, turned back a challenge from CLICKBAIT racing into upper stretch, went clear under some hand prompting and was wrapped up late while drawing
away. The latter was pulling a bit stalking the pacesetter between foes in the second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to lodge a brief bid racing
through the far turn but proved no match for the winner in the last quarter. PINUP GIRL settled along the inside dropping well off the leaders, saved ground
to the lane and continued to make some progress to gain a share. FIRSTMATE, firmly rated along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter to the
backstretch, swung out nearing upper stretch but offered no rally. HONEY'S SOX APPEAL tracked off the second flight three wide to the backstretch, was
prompted to make some brief progress after a half but came up empty nearing the lane.
