WATCH HER STRUT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, shook clear from a rival into the second turn and held under steady pressure. COME ON
CITY (GER) steadied slightly on heels from the gate, saved ground through the turns, angled out into the stretch to split foes four wide, then made a steadsy
gain and closed the gap on the winner late. UJJAYI broke out at the start, rated close up inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of
rivals into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. VIOLET BLUE allowed to settle, looped two and three wide through the second turn, angled in
and came through inside into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. MARMALADE broke out at the start, ran evenly to the lane, then
weakened in the drive. REDEEM MY HEART stalked the pace outside and faded the final furlong.

BEEST mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and closed well for the place. SENNEBEC SUMMER chased
the pace, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, then could not match strides with that one,
weakened and held the show. I'LL GETTHEWHISKEY bumped at the start, was allowed to settle three wide, then passed a tiring rival for a share.

pressure. HEARTY PARTY allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, angled out and closed well for the
place. LOOKIN PERFECT allowed to settle, gained position three and four wide through thge turn, bid four wide into the lane and got up for the show.
COUNTRY THUNDER mid pack, saved ground through the turn on the two path, bid on that path, angled out for clear racing room and had a mild gain. GO
GIRL GONE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then weakened the final furlong. OUR GIRL SNICK
mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out and weakened. RAGAZZA VELOCE evenly for half, had no
rally inside. GOLDEN ACES was never involved. CONTROLLINGTHEGOLD stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn,
angled in and came through inside, then faded in the drive.
