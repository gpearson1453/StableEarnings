in the final stages. DISCOVERED tracked the pace early on, moved closer and dueled along the far turn, was in the three path into the lane, continued to
battled down the lane but was no match for the winner in the final eighth and held place at the wire. CLEAR FOR ACTION set the pace from the outset, was
put under a duel along the far turn and continued down the lane, faltered late in the drive and missed place in the final stages. LADDIE BOY chased the
pace early, was in the four path into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the stretch run. RANSACK chased the pace early, was off the rail into
the lane while making a bid but faded down the lane. JOCKER JUSTICE stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the

Footnotes
CRAZY BEAUTIFUL was bumped at the start and raced back early on, began to move along the turn, came out and bumped XTREMA twice nearing the
lane, was in the four path into the lane then wandered to the inside down the lane, drove past the leaders from the inside and drew away late while geared
down in the final stages. MANIA stalked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane, took over once in the stretch, inched clear near the eighth pole
but was no match for the winner in the final stages. FABRICATE raced back early on, was in the seven path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but did
not have enough for place in the final stages. XTREMA chased the pace early, was bumped twice by CRAZY BEAUTIFUL entering the lane, made a bid in
the stretch but weakened late in the drive. HIPNOTIZADA stalked the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but hung in
the late stages. WHOLEBODEMEISTER tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the stretch run. PUYE TIMING was
through after a half. LACEY BOSS bobbled at the start and was no threat. SEGURO set the pace for a half then folded up. YOGURT was never a factor.
MACI'S JAMMING was never involved. TOURRISTA broke out at the start and was done early. The rider of XTREMA claimed an objection against the rider
of CRAZY BEAUTIFUL for inteference nearing and into the stretch but after review by the stewards the claim was disallowed.

Footnotes
LADY KATE set the pace early on while being pressured from the outside, was in the three path into the lane then drew away late in the stretch under a
steady drive. NEW ROO pressed the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane, no match for the winner in the stretch and held place in the final
stages. ISTAN COUNCIL chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane while making a bid and did not have enough for place in the final stages.
GRANDARIA raced back early on, was in the seven path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. CLUB CAR chased the pace early, was in the six
path into the lane while making a bid but leveled off late in the stretch drive. STREET BAND was steadied into the first turn, raced back early on, was in the
four path into the lane and empty in the stretch drive. WITH DIGNITY was never a threat. DIVINE QUEEN chased the pace early, was off the rail into the
lane and faded down the lane. LADY APPLE raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane and empty late in the stretch run. RED DANE (ITY)
was never a factor. TIMELESS CURLS was through after a half.

but was no match for the winner in the stretch and was second best. NECKER ISLAND raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane while making
a bid but was no match for the top two in the stretch run. ROWDY YATES chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and moved up in the
stretch drive. SHARED SENSE trailed the field early on, was in the eight path into the lane and improved position in the stretch. DEAN MARTINI stalked the
