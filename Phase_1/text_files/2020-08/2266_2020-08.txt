Footnotes
GRAND TRIBUTE outrun early, advanced along the inside late in the turn, shifted out for the drive, engaged the leader when approaching the furlong
grounds, wore that rival down to edge clear under steady handling. BOURBON REVENGE dueled up front out of the chute, alternated up front in the run up
the backstretch closet to the inside, continued to duel turn, put that rival away turning for home, briefly clear, responded when the winner challenged soon
after, could not match strides late, clearly second best. LONE STAR CLASS tried to get out just after the start through the chute, moved out, came five wide
into the lane, rallied to be well clear of the others, no threat to the op two. HOPE FOR CHANGE set or forced the pace in the two path for five furlongs then
weakened in the drive. ZIPPIT ZIPPY closest to the dueling leaders off the inside, also had little left for the drive. TOO TUFF TO CRY broke in, raced behind
the pace, in some traffic entering the stretch while four wide, came up empty for the run to the wire. STARVICTORY settled off the pace, backed up through
the stretch. FRANKIE'S BONES bothered, checked up at the start, fell far back while very wide, never close. THREE QUARTER SPLIT UNAVAILABLE
DUEL TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MAY HOUR broke with the leaders, raced forwardly early, steadied in tight quarters with just over a half mile remaining, fell back, came three wide out of the
turn, shifted out slightly, set down, kicked down the leader under steady handling. AW SHUCKS in the second flight early while three wide, advanced on the
leaders late in the turn, took over into the stretch, lugged in to put PURE VALOR in tight the final furlong, proved no match for the winner late, narrowly held
the second place position at the wire. PRE HEAT broke with the field, came out to bother the winner with just over four furlongs remaining, tracked the pace
three wide through the turn, moderate late interest to narrowly miss the second place position at the wire. HUFFS TAZ A BOO settled in the main body while
out in the strip, four wide into the lane, set down for the drive, managed some mild late interest to improve a bit in the drive, no real threat to the winner.
PURE VALOR broke back, was used a bit to move up and contest the pace, dueled into the turn, offered brief resistance to AW SHUCKS then could not
keep up with that one nearing midstretch, steadied when put in tight by that same rival the final furlong to lose a couple of positions. TALKOTHTOWN void
of early foot, made little impact in the drive. CHASIN GRACIE broke alertly, set the early pace, dueled into and through much of the turn closest to the
inside, gave way in the drive. LUCKY TAYLOR was never involved. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN AND A
CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF PURE VALOR AGAINST AW SHUCKS FOR INTERFERENCE THE FINAL FURLONG, THE LATTER WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FIFTH.

no threat to the winner. G KATE away in good order just behind the winner, chased that one into and through the turn, continued closest to that same rival
past the furlong marker, caught late for the place. MISS JAMIE broke in to help tighten up the runner up, moved out while off the early pace, three wide
through the turn, struck a good nearing the midway point on the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. RUN LAUGHING

Footnotes
DOUBLE COOL broke back, lacked speed through the first turn, began a steady advance before a half, collared the leader from the outside turning for
home, dueled the next eighth of a mile then edged clear. EL HOMBRE forwardly placed from the start, took over three wide after a half, dueled with the
winner inside that one upper stretch, could not match strides with that rival late, clearly second best. CLASSIC GREELEY settled off the pace while four
wide through the first turn, moved in, behind some traffic turning for home, split foes, up for the show, no threat to the top pair. STRIKING STAR chased the
early leader, fell back the middle half mile, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. DREWTEMPO broke out, bumped foe start, raced
back, moved closer into the lane, flattened out in the drive. HERE COMES HOMER settled off the pace and the inside, came four wide into the stretch,
failed to rally. VIVINSKY sprinted clear soon after the start, faltered when headed by the winner after a half. MY CLASSIC BOWTIE pulled early when off the
pace, came up empty when called on for the drive. COOL INDIVIDUAL bumped at the start, fell far back, pulled up far turn, vanned off.

Footnotes
IDE B A WINNER broke outward to slightly bother an outer foe but alertly, dueled out of the chute and up the backstretch off the inside, shook that foe into
the turn, shrugged off a tepid bid turning for home from the runner up, steadily widened advantage under a hand ride to win ridden out. GOING JAPANESE
forwardly placed behind the dueling leaders up the backstretch, crept a bit closer to the winner on the outside late in the turn, proved no match in the drive,
clearly second best. TENCENTSUPERHOOP broke back, moved up, raced in mid pack off the inside, came five wide out of the turn, rallied for the show, no
threat to the top two. MY HARVEY chased the early duel, moved out a bit to be four wide out of the turn, went evenly through the lane to lose the show
latee. GALLOPING BOOTS void of early foot, came five wide into the stretch, improved position without posing a serious threat. CLASSIC EMMETT off a bit
slow, lacked speed, four wide entering the stretch, improved upper stretch then flattened out a bit in the final furlong. RUNCIMAN settled off the pace while
racing outside, failed to rally. CLEVER PRINCE broke in the air, raced back early, improved a bit in the turn then tired in the drive. PENNIES LIL MAN
dueled early inside the winner, gave way after a half. BREAKING RIVERS bothered a bit to be off slowly, was never close. BLUE RIDGE BODI broke back,
moved up a bit early, stopped in the turn to finish far back.

VALENTINES DAY second flight early inside, steadied late in the first turn when in traffic, settled off the pace the middle half under confident handling,
remained within striking distance far turn, steered out for the drive, engaged the leaders from the outside past the furlong marker, edged clear then held the
runner up safe late. BLESSED ANNA fell back off the early pace, asked along far turn, angled out to be four wide into the straight, finished willingly to be
slowly getting to the winner late. MY LITTLE ROSY forwardly placed while racing off the inside, continued to stalk up the backstretch and into the far turn,
challenged three wide into the lane, lugged in when putting a head in front nearing midstretch, could not contain the top two late, saved the show. LIZZ A
BEE last away, trailed while saving ground, continued inside into the lane, improved up the rail without posing a serious threat. SEVEN JEWELS away in
good order, dueled up front in the two path, continued to vie into the lane, weakened final furlong. MAJESTIC EDGE broke alertly, forced for set the pace
along the inside until a furlong remained and gave way. QUEEN GIGI was finished after a half.

Footnotes
FLASHY IMAGE five wide into the first turn when with the main body, raced in the second flight while remaining outside up the backstretch, ranged up to
challenge outside the leader into the stretch, dueled past the furlong marker then wore that rival down under firm handling. TIZONA pressed the leader early
from the outside, took over after a half to be clear late in the final turn, responded when the winner came alongside shortly thereafter, dueled past the
furlong marker and proved stubborn to the end, well clear of the others. DONWELL in mid pack while off the inside, four wide when beginning to move a bit
closer second turn, chased the top two past the furlong marker, proved no match for that pair, held the show late. SON OF A SAINT lacked speed, began to
advance just before a half, continued to improve through some traffic into the stretch, slowly gaining for the show late while also not a threat to the top two.
SONG N A CAT settled off the pace and the inside, moved a bit closer in some traffic late in the final turn, came up empty when clear for the drive. LUCKY
ANDY forwardly placed while saving ground, tired in the drive. CHAOSMOS pulled while behind the pace along the inside through the first turn, moved out,
came five wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. SUPER FACTOR lacked early foot, was never a threat. VALYRIAN broke alertly, showed the way
first turn after angling toward the inside, continued to narrowly show the way until headed by the runner up after a half and began to weaken. ARTIST BY
THE SEA off a step slow, was never close.

Footnotes
TREYS MIDNITE MOON bothered slightly at the start, moved up to settle in the main body three wide, continued in the three path, advanced from between
horses turning for home, late surge to take control in the waning strides and edge clear at the wire. KING OF CANDY never far back off the inside, stalked
the pace in the run up the backstretch, took over far turn, clear into the stretch, could not contain the winner late while holding sway for the place. IM A
COWBOY TOO in the second flight while off the inside, continued to race in a forward position up the backstretch, remained in striking position entering the
stretch but lacked a closing punch. INDEPENDENT WORKER lacked early foot, began to move closer while four wide in the second turn, lost some ground
to the top three turning for home, not enough late to earn the show. PEACOCK KITTEN void of early foot outside, was five wide turning for home, displayed
a mild amount of late interest to improve slightly, not a serious threat. MAKE ME SMILE raced within striking distance much of the way in the second flight,
came up empty for the stretch run. REMEMBERMIS devoid of early foot, continued back, displayed a modest amount of late energy to improve position by
passing mostly tiring rivals. GREAT fell well back off the pace after the start, made little impact in the drive. PAPA'S BOY forwardly placed early along the
inside, began to falter far turn. GALAXY BUILDER remained always back. MISTAKE PRESENT was finished after a half. SIR TRUEBADOUR broke in but
alertly, set the pace for over a half, gave way when headed by the winner, continued to falter through the stretch.

Footnotes
SASSY CAMILLE broke in good order, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, headed in the turn, fell back a bit further when straightened for home,
battled back the final furlong while remaining along the inside to prevail in game fashion. AWISHFORGREELEY prompted the issue early outside, ranged
up to challenge three wide late in the turn, showed the way past the furlong marker, outkicked in the late going, well clear of the others. JERRY'S LEGACY
pressed the winner up the backstretch off the inside, put a head in front turn, vied between foes upper stretch, weakened the final furlong, enough left to
save the show. EMERY'S DREAM settled off the pace, evenly paced through the turn and into the lane, lacked a serious late response while slowly gaining
for the show spot. DIGNITYTO INFINITY in a bit tight start, lacked speed, came five wide out of the turn, improved slightly, not a serious threat. EYE ON
THE LADIES broke out to tighten up outer foes, six wide turning for home, remained always back. LUCKY LILY BE within striking distance for three
furlongs, tired. JEWEL OF THE SKY broke through the gate prior to the start, reloaded in good order, broke with the field while outward, mid pack, tired in
the drive. GLADS LOVE CAT mid pack for three eighths, backed up through the stretch. BLUE SUEDE RANSOM in tight at the break to be last away,
trailed throughout.
