BLUES RAPPER was unhurried to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch then shifted widest for the drive, rallied determinedly and was along in time.
SWIFT CHANNEL stalked the pace to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, dueled the favorite through the final furlong, could not stall the winner
but got the better of MATSON for second. MATSON was outrun for a half mile, got fanned four wide while rallying on the second turn, pushed up to engage
SWIFT CHANNEL for the lead in mid stretch, could not shake off that one then was passed by the winner and hung late to miss the place. GOLD N GRAND
was outsprinted to the second turn, saved ground while closing the gap to the stretch then flattened in the final furlong. MULZOFF had good speed, set the
pace from the rail for six furlongs but was overtaken in upper stretch and tired. BOISTEROUS RASCAL pressed MULZOFF to the second turn in the two
path then was outrun to the stretch and gave way.

PRINCE. The latter was in hand to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, inched away to mid stretch then resisted until very late. DAVE'S GIFT pressed the
leader early, offered a bid between and two wide on the turn then got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. WONDER OF AUTISM leaned in and brushed

Footnotes
HOLD ME CLOSE showed the best speed, set the pace to the second turn, was two wide and turned back INSANIAMANIA to the stretch then dug in
determinedly to hold. PREMIER LEAGUE broke a bit slow, had no speed, settled to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, was bothered briefly by
INTRINSIC VALUE in upper stretch then was responding but lugged in sharply leaving the furlong marker and settled for second. INSANIAMANIA chased
the pace to the second turn, made a run at the winner three wide but was turned away, outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. INTRINSIC VALUE settled
mid pack to the half, was two wide on the second turn, lugged out in upper stretch and came up empty. ROYALLY BIG had no speed, raced off the rail on
the second turn but lacked a closing response. CHASE CHEETO was chasing to the half then saved ground while being outrun and gave way.

TWO BEARS tracked the pace to the turn, came two wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and wore down REAL KEEPER for the win. REAL KEEPER
contested the pace from the rail to the stretch, inched away to mid stretch then could not stall the winner. CIMARRON was outsprinted to the turn, got
fanned four wide to the stretch and finished in a good rally. AND COUNTING tracked the leaders to the turn, made a run three wide to loom a threat to the
stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. BE LIFTED UP got outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch but came up empty
in the drive. PRORIKA was hustled along to contest the pace, raced two wide to the stretch but tired in the final furlong. SEIZE THE CHANCE was very
green on the backstretch then bore out seven wide on the turn and was not a factor.

NEVER FOR MONEY chased the pace to the turn, came two wide to the stretch, was caught behind NO COVER CHARGE to mid stretch, got steered out
nicely to rally between rivals and caught CAROLINA MIA late. CAROLINA MIA pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, rallied to get to terms in mid
stretch, took a short lead to the sixteenth marker then could not stall the winner. DRAW ME chased the pace to the turn, was three wide to the stretch then
was gaining slightly late. NO COVER CHARGE set the pace from the rail to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then was overtaken and weakened.
POPULAR APPEAL had no speed, raced two wide on the turn and lacked a closing bid. SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE was rank down the backstretch, raced three
then four wide to the stretch and could not make an impact. STRADARI stalked the leaders from the rail to the stretch then lacked the needed late response.
