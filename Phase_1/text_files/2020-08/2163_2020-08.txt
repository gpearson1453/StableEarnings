GENERAL TONE dueled from the inside early, gained a clear margin through the turn, widen the effort at the eighth pole and was well clear while under
steady urging. CAVIAR COOL stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded but was no match while clearly
second best. ADMIRAL BROWN dueled from the outside early, chased the pace through the turn, held a forward position for the drive and just lasted for the
show. GRAN RED forced the early pace outside, responded but just missed the show. ZENS SECRET vied early from the outside then tired. IKON WHO
went evenly. MOSCA was no factor. E PORTO was no threat. BLUSHING DREAMER was squeezed at the start and no factor.
