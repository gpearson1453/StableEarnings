Footnotes
JUSTICE IN VEGAS broke outwards, tracked the trio of dueling leaders from the four path around the turn, inched closer to produce a four wide bid for the
lead turning for home, then kicked clear of inner foes passing the sixteenth pole while staying in the middle part of the track. D'ARK FLATTER chased the
leaders along the inside early on before making a three wide bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, vied around the bend before forging an advantage at
the quarter pole, but was outfinished by a wider oncharging rival at the sixteenth pole before prevailing over inner foes for place. LITTLE MASON was urged
along to vie for the lead two wide early on, remained under coaxing while vying between horses around the turn, dug in through the lane for place, but was
bested by his outer foe for that position inside the final sixteenth. CHIEF RED BULL broke sharp, vied along the inside of a pair of rivals around the turn, but
gave way in the final furlong. BROTHER DOC was outrun. Due to a timer malfunction, no times are available and the final time was Hand-Timed. Race was
hand timed

Footnotes
KATIE'S DAY set the pace inside of ROCK OUT while staying a path off of the inner railing, dueled inside of that foe passing the five sixteenths pole, was
headed by that rival in upper stretch, but fought back gamely, and repelled her outer counterpart passing the sixteenth pole to give rider Fernando De La
Cruz his 2,000th career win. ROCK OUT prompted the pace setter from outside of her flank while in the three path, inched closer to duel for the lead at the
five sixteenths pole, sustained the duel through midstrech, but was repelled by her inner counterpart passing the sixteenth pole. TIZ THIRSTY stalked the
leaders while racing along the inner rail through the turn, but was no match for those rivals, failed to produce a bid while shifting a path or two off of the
inside, but was clearly third best. CRIMSON LUCK trailed, took the turn in the four path, and failed to make an impact while passing tired rivals. MY
GUATEMALAN GIRL raced off of the pace in the two path around the turn, and failed to factor. DATA LADY raced off of the pace two wide in the three path,
weakened in the latter part of the turn, and was outrun.

DILETTANTE dueled for the lead inside of a trio of rivals down the backstretch, shifted to the two path into the turn after an outer foe failed to keep pace,
continued to vie inside of a pair of foes, forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, then edged clear in upper stretch and drew off while shifting out
under driving pressure. ACE DESTROYER dueled for the lead three wide and between horses early on, then two wide but still in the three path through the
turn, continued to vie outside of the leader turning for home, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, then held place while shifting out through
the lane. TREETOP FLYER trailed early on, took the turn in the five path, then improved without menacing. ELZABE'S ON BOARD dueled for the lead four
wide early on, then three wide while still in the four path around the turn, but failed to keep pace with his inner foes at the quarter pole, then was outfinished
for minor rewards. TALE OF FAME dueled for the lead two wide and between horses early on, but failed to keep pace with those rivals at the half mile pole,
dropped back to trail the field at the five sixteenths pole, then kept on through the lane in the three path, but failed to re-achieve minor rewards.

RISKY BEHAVIOR dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, responded when asked passing the three sixteenths pole and drew clear from those rivals,
then widened while shifting ground outwards under vigorous hand urging. TAP N SWAY dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but proved no
match for her inner foe passing the three sixteenths pole, then kept on to prove second best. MAJESTIC CLIMB vied for the lead three wide, but failed to
keep pace with her inner foes approaching the three sixteenths pole, then held show through the lane. SISTER'S GHOST took a bad step approaching the
half mile pole, recovered to stalk the trio of leaders in the four path around the turn, inched closer turning for home, but failed to produce a bid before lugging
in passing the furlong pole, then hung and failed to achieve show. BEACH BAR chased from midpack, saved ground through the turn, and finished evenly.
FLAT OUT PRETTY raced far off of the pace tow wide, and never got involved. PURE AIR HAVANA saved ground far off the pace, and failed to factor.
SURE BABY was off awkwardly and a length or two slowly, raced far off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and did not get involved.

SECOND EXCHANGE was taken back at the start, trailed the field in the three path, followed the move of three bidding foes into the far turn, tracked that
trio from the five path around the far turn, then rallied on her left lead and produced a bid at the furlong pole, and drove past inner foes at the sixteenth pole.
HITCHED settled off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leaders into the backstretch before being forced to make a three to two
wide bid between horses into the far turn, vied inside of a pair of foes while staying in the two path around the far turn, dug in to hold an advantage through
midstretch, but was outfinished in the final furlong. MAGNIFICENTREVENGE settled off of the pace in the four path around the first turn, advanced to
stalking position into the backstretch, was forced to make a four wide bid at the seven sixteenths pole as ARTFUL MEMORIES forced her hand, vied two
wide in the three path and between horses around the far turn, but tired in the late stages and was outfinished between rivals in the final furlong. TOUCH OF
BLESSING was bumped by an outer foe at the start, saved ground in midpack around the first turn, then passed tired foes in the three to four path into and
around the far turn, then stayed on along the rail through the lane to pass a tired foe without threatening the leaders. ARTFUL MEMORIES was brushed by
horses on both side after the start, raced far off of the pace two wide before rallying five wide approaching the half mile pole, vied three wide while in the four
path around the far turn, but weakened passing the quarter pole. GO GERTIE GO set the pace along the inside, lost the lead at the half mile pole, then
weakened into the far turn and was eased thereafter. PISANTE' CAT broke in and bumped a foe a the start, prompted the pace two wide in three path while
keen around the first turn, cleared an inner foe at the half mile pole, but was swamped by multiple foes into the far turn, and was eased thereafter.

closer turning for home, shifting inwards in upper stretch to produce a bid inside of the drifting leader, and drove past that foe at the furlong pole. SWEET N
WICKED stalked outside of the pace setter in the four path, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but drifted out while forging an advantage turning for
home, got headed by an inner rallying rival at the furlong pole, then kept on bu failed to rebid. MONKEY MIND raced off of the pace in the five to three path
around the turns, and passed tired foes in the five path through the lane. VIOLATION held a loose lead in the three path down the backstretch, but was
tested by SWEET N WICKED around the far turn turn, was headed at the quarter pole, and weakened. STROLLIN THE BAYOU was forwardly placed in the
two path, but failed to keep pace with the leader passing the five sixteenths pole, and weakened on her left lead through the lane. POUR GIRL tracked from

Footnotes
MR. QUALITY was forwardly placed in the four to three path around the turns, bid for the lead two wide at the quarter pole, dueled for the lead while being
herded out by his inner counterpart in upper stretch, then edged clear passing the sixteenth pole. I WILL STAND vied for the lead along the inside while a
path off of the inner rail, stalked into the backstretch, but was driven to keep pace with the leader passing the five sixteenths pole, failed to do so, but shifted
to the four path in midstretch and kept on to pass a tiring foe for place. HARD TO BE GOOD set the pace in the three path around the first turn, cleared and
shifted down to the two path into the backstretch, held a margin before being tested by MR QUALITY turning for home, drifted out while digging in to hold an
advantage, but was bested at the sixteenth pole, and tired. WAGON BOSS tracked from midpack in the three to four path around the turns, but failed to
make a bid and only produce a mild gain through the lane. UPHOLD saved ground from midpack, shifted two wide and between horses into the far turn, but
failed to rally and weakened turning for home. CALIFORNIA SWING raced far off of the pace, took the five path around the far turn, and failed to factor.
ANIMUS trailed the field in the two path and never got involved.

Footnotes
MAX EXPRESS was brushed by an inner foe at the start, raced far off of the pace two wide, commenced a rally in the three path passing the five sixteenths
pole, sustained his rally to split the leaders passing the furlong pole, then quickly cleared and won going away. NATES HEARTTHROB prompted the pace
setter two wide and in the three path, but came under a drive passing the three furlong pole, produced a bid for the lead between horses as
REDSKIESATNIGHT ranged up alongside, vied in upper stretch before drifting out and bumping that aforementioned foe approaching the furlong pole, then
was no match for an inner surging foe at that marker, but repelled his outer counterpart for place. REDSKIESATNIGHT broke inward, took back to midpack
after being floated wide into the first turn, advanced in the four path to stalking position down the backstretch, chased the leaders three wide around the far
turn before bidding for the lead turning for home, but was bumped by his inner rival at the furlong pole, flattened out, and was repelled by that foe foe place.
NUTTY TRAIN broke out, raced far off of the pace in the four to five path around the first turn advanced down the backstretch to midpack, then stayed on
through the lane, but did not have enough to make a bid. RAINY DAY DREAMIN stalked along the inside, came under a drive passing the half mile pole, but
weakened into the far turn, then refound stride in midstretch and kept on late. EXPRESSED hopped inwards and shied at the start, saved ground far off of
the pace and passed tired foes. EMPIRE'S SCORE raced off of the pace two wide around the turns, and failed to factor. HE'S A WARRIOR set the pace
along the inside, but was headed at the three sixteenths pole, and stopped through the lane. GUN HILL tracked from midpack two wide, but weakened at
the half mile pole, and was done early. THE STORY BEGINS was bumped at the start and outrun throughout. Due to a timer malfunction, the three-quarter
fraction was omitted. Race was hand timed.

Footnotes
ARCH ABILITY stalked four wide, bid for the lead four wide at the five sixteenths pole, forged a lead in upper stretch, dueled with his inner game rival
through midstretch, then was brushed by that foe at the sixteenth pole, and cleared off late. DEACON dueled for the lead inside a pair of foes, shifted
outwards turning for home as an outer foe weakened, dug in gamely inside of ARCH ABILITY in upper stretch, battled courageously, but drifted out and
brushed his counterpart at the sixteenth pole, and was bested thereafter. JOHNSTOWN JOHNNY was off a step slowly, raced far off of the pace in the three
to four path around the turns, then split foe at the furlong marker to edge show at the sixteenth pole. RUN LIKE REV vied for the lead three wide, but
weakened between horses turning for home. BRODYTHEOXMAN trailed around the turn, then passed tired foes through the lane and failed to factor. BOO
REID dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with those rivals passing the five sixteenths pole, steadied in tight quarters
at the quarter pole as his inner foe shifted outwards, then subsequently weakened. EAST CODE tracked from off of the pace in the five path off of the turn,
but failed to produce a bid before being outmoved by an inner foe in midstretch, then weakened.
