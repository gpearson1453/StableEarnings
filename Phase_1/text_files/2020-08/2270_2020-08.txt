Footnotes
POLISHED GAL hugged the inner rail stalking the pace to mid turn, swung three wide approaching the stretch, gained the lead outside
GOTTAFLATHAVEHER in mid stretch and was drawing clear late. GOTTAFLATHAVEHER prompted the pace outside NIGHTMARE around the turn,
gained a short lead in upper stretch and continued gamely. SACRED LADY circled the turn three deep, was fanned four wide turning for home and lacked
the necessary late effort. NIGHTMARE , angled to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, set the pace around the turn and weakened in the drive.
MISSIMARD was no factor.

Footnotes
JACK STRAIGHT stalked inside, came under a ride mid turn, eased out into the lane then advanced between rivals, closed in under a drive to take
command outside LION LORD with a little less than a sixteenth to go, kept on and fended off CAUSE HE'S WESTERN. CAUSE HE'S WESTERN , taken to
rated, raced between foes nearing the turn, tracked mid turn, shifted out five wide for the drive, ranged up outside the winner in deep stretch but just could
not get past. LION LORD quickly went clear, set the pace towards the inside, took pressure from the three eighths to the quarter pole, spurted back away
leaving the thre sixteenths then gave way grudgingly. SMOKIN HOT FACTOR bobbled at the break, recovered and saved ground off the pace, eased out in
deep stretch and kept giving effort. COLONEL SHARP prompted the pace two wide, bid to engage LION LORD leaving the far turn, sparred outside that one
to the quarter pole, drifted out entering the lane and weakened near mid stretch. UMMU UMMU UMMU chased three deep, shifted widest for the drive and
faded.

AWESOME PAL prompted the pace outside MS. HAITI, overtook that one approaching the eighth pole and drove clear. RAN CHAR , rated behind horses
down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, angled off the rail near the eighth pole and rallied between horses. THUNDERINTHEVALLEY broke
sluggishly, advanced outside horses to reach a striking position in mid stretch and flattened out. MS. HAITI sprinted to the early lead, angled to the inner rail
mid way down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, remained on the lead in upper stretch then gradually weakened in the drive. WHOA BLACK
BETTY lacked speed, raced in the two path mid way on the turn, swung to the five path in mid stretch and offered a mild gain outside foes. ANY MINUTE
NOW bore out leaving the starting gate, chased the pace while three deep around the turn and weakened in the drive. BROADWAY TROUPER gave way
on the turn. BOTTLE COURAGE , kept wide on the turn, trailed.

Footnotes
HOT N SPICY LOVE was rated back soon after the break and settled nicely while well off the pace, moved in hand three wide past the three eighths, swung
six wide for a clear run into the lane, responded when put urging, forged clear in mid stretch and widened while under some hand encouragement. ITGOT
GRANDMA prompted the pace three wide, bid between take over after a half mile, handled outside pressure into the lane and briefly shook clear, could not
resist the winner heading to mid stretch but stayed on well to save the place. CAMPARI broke slowly, lagged well off the pace, swung very wide for the
drive, closed belatedly and nabbed the show at the wire. SIDEWALK PROPHET was floated out a bit leaving the chute, was guided down and stalked in
about the four path, bid between foes near the half mile pole, forced the pace outside ITGOT GRANDMA into the lane, pursued past the furlong grounds
then gave way grudgingly. MONKEY'S MEDAL lacked speed, raced four wide into the lane, shifted in late and offered a mild kick. STOLEN LOVE lost
ground five wide outside rivals while stalking the pace, came under a ride mid turn, stayed in touch to about the three sixteenths then faded.
IWISHIWASPECIAL stumbled at the break then checked while also a bit rank, regrouped and quickly gained while racing in the clear past the half mile pole,
had aim on the leaders mid turn, altered out some near the three sixteenths then gave way. GREEK GOD sped clear early and set the pace towards the
inside, was overwhelmed heading to the three eighths, faltered and was eased in the drive.

Footnotes
COMMANDING GENERAL hugged the inner rail around the turn, angled out turning for home, led near the sixteenth pole and prevailed under brisk urging.
CHAUFFEUR , two wide between horses on the turn, floated out in upper stretch and had a mild rally. MIRACLE BOBBIE , quickly clear, angled to the rail
mid way down the backstretch, set the pace to the sixteenth pole then gave way. MORE TWIRL saved ground around the turn, was well placed near the rail
turning for home, came up empty and his rider dropped his whip in upper stretch. JOLLY SWAGMAN , no factor, raced along the inner rail in the stretch.
PERFECT KIND , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
TAPPIN CAT rated back off the leaders leaving the five eighths pole, chased the dueling trio past the five sixteenths, came five wide for the drive, closed
determinedly under right handed rousing and just got up. FORT FORTITUDE vied three deep under a light hold, came under pressure heading to the
quarter pole, kicked clear under a drive nearing mid stretch, wandered outward from some left handed, dug in when confronted, dueled late but just failed to
hold. FOLLOW THE DOG moved up between rivals in the opening sixteenth, dueled from the far turn to upper stretch then faded very late. ALLTHEWAY
TO CAIRO leaned in at the break, was quickly corrected and accelerated to contention inside foes, battled into the lane, stayed willingly past the furlong
grounds then weakened late.

BOURBON STREET , right to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, drew off and was ridden out. SEVEN ON THE ROCKS , rated inside horses into the
turn, eased out to the three path leaving the bend, failed to menace the winner and was best of the others. KELLI'S SMILE hugged the inner rail around the
turn, remained inside foes in the stretch and gave way. GOLAZO , two wide on the turn, chased the winner and gave way. KICKSTARTER , pinched back
leaving the starting gate, swung to the six path turning for home and passed a pair of tired rivals. LORDHAVEMERCY , swung wide in upper stretch, gave
way. GOLDEN SURGE saved ground on the turn while outrun.
