Footnotes
Following an hour delay to the post time due to a tote malfunction and a further two minute drag, OUR DESTINY coaxed from the gate, knocked heads
briefly with STRIKING CAUSEWAY before establishing sole command to show the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole,
cut the corner into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under increasing threat late and held on to prevail. STRIKING
CAUSEWAY coaxed from the gate, knocked heads with the aforementioned foe before being shaken off, chased in closest aim just off the inside coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, closed in through the final eighth as the leader began to weaken and was repelled to
the finish. ADVANCED STRATEGY chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home, offered up a mild bid.
SILVER TOKEN chased three to four wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing two to three wide at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for
home and was outkicked. THE GOLDEN DOOR two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, closed in through the final sixteenth while making no headway position wise. FAST GORDON two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three
furlongs from home, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
ASHIHAM bumped with foes on both sides at the start, dropped well behind on the initial straightaway under urging, lagged at the rear while ridden along,
went three then four wide on the far turn, passed the five-sixteenths under a right-handed whip, gained five wide into the stretch, switched to a left-handed
whip inside the three-sixteenths, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed fast to get the lead into the final sixteenth then drifted in while moving clear late
and prevailed in a very long drive. OBSESSED bumped with a rival at the start then was sent hard to the lead, set the pace in the two path, was asked
under threat outside the five-sixteenths, came under the whip inside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage while dropping to the rail into the stretch, fought
on well under a drive in the lane and narrowly earned the place. THE ANGRY MAN went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was
given his cue leaving the backstretch, gained in the three path on the far turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, took the lead under a right-handed whip
while dropping to the two path into the stretch, shied out just inside the three-sixteenths after switched to a left-handed whip, went back to a right-handed
whip shortly thereafter, fought outside of the runner-up into the final furlong, drifted in closer to that foe under continued right-hand urging outside the
sixteenth-pole and was overtaken by the winner then just missed the place but was clear for the show. LUCKY ASSET came out in front but had the rider
break against his mouth and dropped back while throwing his head high, went four then three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, came under
urging before the half-mile pole, advanced four wide on the far turn, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths, was put to a right-handed whip outside the
quarter-pole, switched to a left-handed whip while battling on even terms for the lead outside the furlong marker, dropped back into the final sixteenth and
weakened. TENDERFOOT bumped with an opponent at the start, was rated inside on the first turn, settled into a comfortably stride down the backstretch
while well positioned, was asked along the rail midway through the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then came under the whip and had nothing
left. MAKE MOTIME went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch
under the whip and came up empty.

Footnotes
GOLDEN PAL shot of the gate with blazing speed, cut over towards the inside, was rated along showing the way, spaced at a slight distance from off the
hedge, was lightly hand ridden three wide into the stretch, got switched over a light drive at the three-sixteenths pole, kicked well clear before being geared
down in the final seventy yards. FAUCI stalked the winner from the two path, angled four wide into the stretch, proved no match while staying on well for the
place. SKY'S NOT FALLING pursued the front runners from the three path, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, lacked the necessary stretch
response. SUNNY ISLE BEACH taken hold of after coming out with his initial step, narrowly avoided contact with its likewise wayward next stall neighbor,
tracked the front runners from the inside route, tipped out into the two path two coming onto the head of stretch, had no closing punch. KENTUCKY KNIGHT
underwent a ground-saving journey and faltered. BAYTOWN BEAR away the tardiest after caught leaning in at the break, got going after an abbreviated
brisk hand ride, brought up the back of the pack riding the hedge, was moved out into the two path, had no offering, saw the pilot resort to a light hand and
was allowed to fade away in the final furlong.

wide after turning into the stretch, rallied outside while still on his inside lead, switched to the proper lead under a right-handed whip approaching the furlong
marker, took the lead while switched to a left-handed whip nearing the sixteenth-pole, fought with the runner-up to the wire and gamely prevailed under
strong handling. PROPENSITY bumped with a rival at the start, was rated off the pace under restraint, drafted inside on the turn, was asked in the two path
at the three-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong, made a bid between horses outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with the winner to the wire and just
missed while able to get the place. UNPRECEDENTED broke a half-step slow, moved up then stalked the pace on the outside of the leader, vied two to
three wide on the turn, was bumped at the five-sixteenths and forced lightly into another foe, came under urging at the quarter-pole, battled outside of the
pacesetter in upper stretch, was put to the whip outside the furlong marker, fought with multiple foes into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to
get the show. DUBAI BOBBY broke out and bumped with a foe then was hustled to the lead, set the pace under some pressure to his outside, vied inside to
the two path on the turn, came out and bumped UNPRECEDENTED at the five-sixteenths then was put to a right-handed whip, battled under a drive into the
final sixteenth and was out-kicked. MORE LIKE IT broke a half-step slow, was rated off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, found room while

DUOPOLY established the top in short order, led the competition taking the inside route on the clubhouse bend, ventured into the two path showing the way
on the backstretch, made its way back towards the inside in time for the run around the far turn, settled in at the three-sixteenths pole when finally called
upon for more, lost no discernible real estate during the ensuing furlong, shifted back into being two wide on her own accord with approximately a sixteenth
to go, dug in well to stay sufficiently in the clear. LASHARA (GB) away without apparent mishap, played some follow-the-equine, deftly alternating between
the hedge and two path en route to drafting behind the winner until the end of the second bend, angled out then out-muscled PRINCESA CAROLINE for
path two in the general area of the three-sixteenths marker, tipped one wider before safely through the furlong grounds, got staved off but managed to save
second. EYE OF A SOLDIER underwent a ground-saving journey, saw the runner up vacate the inside route coming up to the top of the lane, had good
clearance with which to launch a rally of her own cutting the corner into the lane, was given her cue, failed to make up any appreciable ground. PRINCESA
CAROLINE secured a forward position along the long straightaway leading up to the clubhouse turn, sputtered towards path three late on the first turn but
was for the most part in two path travelling on it, stalked the winner from the outside on the backstretch, increased her presence after three-quarters had
been reeled off, got turned loose entering the stretch, lost position to the runner up after some contact between them right around the three-sixteenths pole,
began the last eighth in the neighborhood of path four, backed away. PASSION FACTOR bobbled in the shadow of the starting gate, sat reserved two wide
until the conclusion of the backstretch, raced taking the three path on the far turn, got maneuvered into path five from upper to midstretch, made no impact.
MIRABELL MEI got going after undergoing some hand encouragement at the start, took up the chase from path two, checked off the heels of PRINCESA
CAROLINE on the first turn, stepped into the stretch, and gave way. TARANTA (IRE) proceeded along one-paced saving ground for the opening six
furlongs and a bit beyond, got sent out into path five early in the drive, had no rally.

the final furlong to the finish in game fashion and just got the head on the wire to prevail. SOLITARY GEM chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a
mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive getting on track nearing the final
sixteenth and finished with a rush just missing at the end while splitting the stretch duelers on the line. JUMP FOR JOY coaxed from the gate, dueled three
then two wide with LADY BY CHOICE to her inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung two to three wide into upper stretch seizing command
and shaking off her main pace rival, dug in confronted by the eventual winner, knocked heads with her from the three-sixteenths through to the finish getting
narrowly headed inside the final sixteenth and fought on gamely, then got nailed for the place honors in the very last jump to the wire while clear of the rest
for the show. DOVEY LOVEY five to six paths off the inside early on, tucked three to four wide five furlongs from home, then went to the two path into the
turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, offered up a mild bid swinging four to five wide into upper stretch, couldn't sustain the momentum in the
final furlong flattening out in the late stages. FLAT AWESOME JENNY hustled from the gate, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. I'LL TAKE THE CAKE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. LADY BY CHOICE coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with JUMP FOR JOY to
her outside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn and continued to knock heads through the bend coming under coaxing five-sixteenths out,
took the inside route into upper stretch under threat, yielded the front straightened away and folded.

Footnotes
NOBLE EMOTION broke out at the start, moved in while going to the front, showed the way in the two path, was guided around the turn with a little extra
left-rein pressure, came under a right-handed whip after straightening for the drive, responded well under a continued right-handed whip in the final furlong
and held under steady urging. FREEWHEELER settled comfortably off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was roused coming to the five-sixteenths,
turned into the stretch under a right-handed whip, shifted five wide at the three-sixteenths, pursued the winner under a continued right-handed whip and
finished willingly while second best. VETERANS BEACH was rated just off the pace under a snug hold, drafted inside under stout restraint early on the turn,
was asked inside the five-sixteenths, cut the corner along the hedge into the stretch, chased under the whip into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick
while just able to get the show. CRACK SHOT broke out and brushed the gate, tracked the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, was asked late
on that bend, came four wide into the stretch, chased under a right-handed whip while still on his inside lead, dropped back into the final furlong, swapped to
the proper lead outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened. BEACHSIDE settled towards the rear on the outside, dropped from the three path to the two path
under coaxing on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came under the whip in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. ADIOS AMIGOS
was urged along at the rear of the field, went two then three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. VENTUS
bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, moved out near the half-mile pole, was urged along while four wide on the turn, dropped back into
upper stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
KILKEA well rated in path two keeping watch on the front runners for the opening three-quarters, slipped to the outside after the third fraction had been
finalized, challenged in earnest spinning three wide into the lane, inched her way up to the one to catch during the ensuing furlong, got driven to the lead
about a sixteenth later and edged away. KEPT WAITING attained a prominent position, was patiently ridden stalking KAZ'S PRINCESS from path two,
moved when ready as the twosome arrived at the three-eighths pole, extended the lead the remainder of the journey to the end of the second bend, pilot
continuing to hold something in reserve, was called upon for more getting put to the test by the winner in upper stretch, held out on the front until the general
area of the sixteenth pole, had enough left afterwards to salvage second. GAELIC GOLD unhurried travelling in the two path, got guided into the third one at
the five-sixteenths pole, came under a ride spinning into the stretch, mustered up a mild response to secure the show. MICROMILLION rode the hedge, was
let out a notch angling out from the five-sixteenths marker, commenced the stretch from path two, improved, but all done without making an impact. PLINK
FREUD cut over to the inside after the field had been sent off and running, rated unkindly for a good portion of the initial half by fighting the pilot hard on the
bit in addition to having the rider tap the brakes at intervals, saved ground on turn two, going about somewhat more professionally, cut the corner into the
lane, flattened out in the last eighth. DANCING SLIPPERS rode the hedge for six furlongs, swung out three wide entering the stretch, had no closing punch.
EXCITED FEELING bobbled slightly taking an awkward first step, took up the chase three wide on both turns, wandered out into path six during the first
stages of the stretch run, lacked a response. KAZ'S PRINCESS reluctant to load, broke forwardly placed, established the top and was guided over to the
inside, showed the way appearing keen during the opening phases, had no answer when challenged by the second place finisher midpoint turn two, steadily
retreated after yielding.
