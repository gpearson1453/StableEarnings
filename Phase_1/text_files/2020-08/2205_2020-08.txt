SOCIAL CIRCLE seized command going into the initial turn, edged clear leaving the far turn and held sway in the stretch. SATTERSFIELD reserved, lodged
a three wide bid on the far turn, was angled in for the stretch run and rallied. SPARKLE O MINE chased the pacesetter and came up empty in the stretch.
CLOSE TO ME was outpaced while three wide and made no bid. IRISH MUSIC saved ground and did not factor. NAPILI had an awkward start and was
outrun.
