Footnotes
MOLESLEY raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside in the run down the backstretch and
through the final turn, turned back a determined QUAGMIRE in deep stretch and inched clear late. QUAGMIRE away alertly and pressed the leader two
wide entering the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of MOLESLEY in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to match
strides with that rival in deep stretch, but proved clearly second best. TITUS COMMAND settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering
the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly one out from the rail in the drive to prove best of the rest. CASH
HIT lagged well off the early pace racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, and
finished three wide in the drive. RED HOT RIO unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed
closing response when called upon. KODEE'S HONOUR away well and stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
DEVIL OF A DEAL away alertly and pressed the pace one out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch
and through the final turn, and inched clear late to prove best. STONERIDGE AMBER broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the
first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the inside
in the drive, but was unable to match strides with the winner in the late going. BAKZONE stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from
the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and found her best stride late while finishing three out from the rail to get up for the show in the final strides.
HEART OF TEXAS tracked the leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished three
wide in the drive and just failed to hold the show position. LIZZIES GIRL away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground along
the inside, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the stretch drive. ALAFAIR unhurried early while trailing the
field into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied inside entering the final turn, but was unable to mount a late bid.

Footnotes
SYNERGY settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, continued from the outside in the run down the
backstretch, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, collared the pacesetter entering the lane, and drew clear late. PORTER GENT away well and
raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch, maintained his advantage into the
final turn, was overtaken soon after entering the lane, but battled gamey to prove second best. YO ZACKLY away alertly and tracked the leader through the
stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained that tracking trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside through the final
turn, and finished willingly two wide in the drive in a solid effort. CAPILANO CANYON broke sharply and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time
while under snug restraint at the rail, lost a bit of ground while continuing to save ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside
through the final turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, and finished three out from the rail in the drive while unable to mount a late bid. SLEW'S BAK
unhurried early while dropping back to trail, continued to trail the field into the final turn, commenced his bid five wide through the turn, and closed four wide
in the drive while passing tiring rivals. HOME RUN GUY stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, rallied two
wide entering the final turn, but weakened in the late stages. CASCADE BILLY stalked the leader into the lane the first time while racing one out from the
rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon.

BABYLON WILL FALL broke sharply and tracked the leaders through the second turn while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering
the final turn, assumed command soon after entering the lane, and inched clear late. OUREVELADY settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail
through the stretch the first time, raced two out from the rail in the run to the final turn, rallied one out from the rail entering the turn, and closed three wide in
the drive while gaining ground late. MORI GIRL away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, dictated the pace in
the run down the backside and into the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, but finished willingly two wide in the drive to hold on for a share.
BAMBOO ELEVEN settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the second turn, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and
finished three wide in the drive. COMMERCIAL APPEAL settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time,
checked when put in tight quarters midway down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, shifted four wide in mid stretch, but was
unable to mount a serious late bid. SEVEN CHANCES away well and pressed the pace one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, chased the
pacesetter two wide in the run down the backside, but faded over the final furlong. FOURTOWIN tracked the leaders through the lane the first time while
saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. FAST BID (IRE) stalked the leaders three out
from the rail through the stretch the first time, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

SIMPLY GOLDEN unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied smartly four wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly four out from the rail
to get up in time. SOME GOLD away alertly and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace in the run down
the backside and through the final turn, was unable to fend off the late surge by SIMPLY GOLDEN, but finished well to just hold the place. BOOKIE broke
sharply and stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed
with a rush from along the rail in deep stretch to just miss the place. SUNDAY DANCER tracked the leader from along the rail through the stretch the first
time, continued to save ground in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive.
KINDERGARTENGRADER settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the rail through the final turn, but was unable to mount a
serious late bid. BUCK tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was
outfinished in the late stages. KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN away well and stalked the leader through the lane the first time while racing two out from the rail,
rallied three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to mount a late bid while finishing four wide in the drive. RANDOM ACT was off a step slow and
lagged well back entering the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, was always well back and failed to make an impact. HEREVERYWISH
settled off the early pace while racing three wide through the stretch the first time, began to advance three out from the rail upon entering the backstretch,
rallied two wide into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.
