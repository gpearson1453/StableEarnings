Footnotes
FENDER BENDER broke slowly,then stumbled when appearing to clip heels just after the start, was settled into stride dropping well off the leaders,
gathered momentum splitting rivals nearing upper stretch, shifted three wide entering the lane and continued with a steady late response to wrest the
advantage in time under firm left handed pressure. CORRANA EN LIMEN broke readily, was urged along between rivals pursuing the pacesetter into the
bend, steadily closed the gap on the leader racing past midstretch and prevailed for the place honors. EPIC DRAMA, urged to the lead along the rail, set the
pace on a clear margin into the turn, resisted several challengers in late stages but yielded to the top pair late. ONOMATOPOEIA, bumped lightly at the
start, angled to the inside early tracking off the first flight, saved ground to upper stretch and continued willingly between rivals late. FAYETTE WARRIOR
tracked the leaders four wide racing to the turn and faded into the stretch. AT IT EARLY broke outwards bumping a rival, was collected to track the leaders
three deep between foes racing into the turn and gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
ANGELINA'S HEAVEN tracked the pacesetter from out of striking distance outside a rival to the first turn, continued off the inside while commencing a
steady advance nearing the far turn, moved to terms with the leader on her own courage racing into upper stretch and went clear when roused through the
closing stages. CATTY KRYS angled in sharply racing to the first turn shutting off SAPPHIRE JUBILEE, continued tracking the pacesetter as part of the
second flight, conceded some position nearing the second bend, saved ground through the far turn gathering momentum, shifted three wide racing through
upper stretch while being urged to challenge but proved no match while prevailing for the place honors. MORNING REPORT, rated between rivals off the
second flight in the opening stages, altered course avoiding traffic racing into the first turn, tracked the leaders three wide into the lane, then shifted inwards
entering the lane gaining position between foes to the end. SILVERA tracked the leaders three wide off the second flight in early stages, was fanned four
wide into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. CASHMERE BLISS broke sharply, sprinted clear of the field into the first turn, held sway on a
commanding margin into the second bend, set the pace to upper stretch and gave out once headed midstretch. SAPPHIRE JUBILEE, caught in tight
quarters in the opening stages racing nearest the rail, was steadied when appearing to clip heels behind CATTY KRYS racing into the first turn and trailed
thereafter.

ARCADIA CALLS broke readily to race on terms with the leaders, was eased off the pace racing nearest the rail through the backstretch, shifted out four
wide entering the turn while being prompted to advance, steadily gained on the leaders in that path to challenge nearing midstretch, then gained the
advantage in the closing stages under firm handling and right handed pressure. TRAPALANDA joined the pace outside foes racing in the four path in the
opening quarter, pressed the issue three wide through the turn to upper stretch to gain a narrow advantage, resisted the winner's challenge to late stages
but proved only second best. CHATTERMAN, reserved in early stages, raced five wide into the turn and continued with interest to narrowly prevail for a
share nearing the wire. SERMON BY THE SEA, urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, weakened nearing midstretch.
LEAGUE OF SHADOWS, urged inside foes disputing the pace racing into the turn, gave way in late stages.

GOPHER GOLD angled to the rail in the opening stages tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance under light rating, shifted out three wide
racing into upper stretch while advancing to challenge, was bumped leaving midstretch by BIG FALCON ROCKET but edged forward of that rival under firm
right handed pressure to prevail. The latter sprinted to the lead, held sway on a clear margin to upper stretch, shifted out leaving midstretch bumping the
eventual winner and contested the issue to the end while proving only second best. OVERLY LUCKY was rated off the second flight along the inside, came
through inside foes racing into upper stretch to challenge inside the top pair but lacked the needed final kick. IMA HARLEY TOO was rated off the second
flight three wide to the backstretch, was fanned five wide into the lane and gained some position in an even effort. TALENT AND TRICKS tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight racing to the far turn, was shuffled a bit nearing upper stretch, shifted four wide in the closing stages but lacked the
needed late bid. BYE BYE BENNIE shuffled out of tight quarters just after the start, settled off the second flight, was caught four wide racing into the far turn
and offered no rally. TEKELA'S GLORY settled last to the backstretch and was caught wide throughout while proving no threat. SON OF SO, urged to a
forward placing three wide tracking just off the pacesetter to the far turn, emptied out nearing upper stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF BIG
FALCON ROCKET LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS
DISALLOWED.

GO AWAY was settled last to the backstretch, gathered momentum along the inside nearing upper stretch, shifted out to split rivals to bid inside the leaders
leaving midstretch and narrowly prevailed under brisk left handed pressure. ALWAYS, unhurried along the inside tracking off the first flight to the
backstretch, steadily advanced while shifting out three wide racing into upper stretch, moved to challenge for command midstretch but was just outkicked.
JERRYS PRIDENJOY broke sharply, was urged to forward placing prompting a rival's pace, moved to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, gained
the advantage between calls late, then grudgingly resisted the top pair to the end. CENTRAL PARK shifted out three wide early tracking the first flight from
out of striking distance and came up empty racing into the far turn. UNLEASH THE BEAST, urged to the lead along the inside racing into the first turn,
dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and gave out once headed racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
MY HEART SINGS tracked the pace outside foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, angled four wide racing into the lane steadily drawing into
striking distance and narrowly prevailed in time under firm handling. TRISH THE DISH was settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch,
angled to the inside after a half, saved ground through the far turn, steadily gathered momentum while angling out five wide in the closing stages and moved
to close the gap while edging a rival for the place honors. DEFEND THE ROSE broke sharply to set the pace along the rail into the first turn, conceded the
lead to her entrymate racing into the backstretch, switched outside the leader racing into the far turn while advancing to challenge in upper stretch, gained
the advantage between calls late but couldn't sustain her momentum. DELIA O'HARA tracked the leaders between rivals in second flight to the far turn,
angled to the rail entering the stretch while being urged to advance inside foes but lacked the needed late kick. RENTAL POOL, urged to terms forcing an
entrymate's pace racing to the backstretch, moved clear while angling to the inside, held sway into upper stretch but proved empty leaving midstretch. LADY
HIDEAWAY tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight to the far turn and came up empty nearing the lane. DREAMING BIZ settled near the inside as
part of the last flight early, angled out racing into the lane but offered no rally. IMMINENT THREAT was settled outside foes in the last flight, was fanned six
wide into the lane and dropped out.

SON OF POSEIDON, forwardly placed along the inside racing into the first turn, tracked just off the leader along the rail under light rating to the far turn,
switched outside that foe to gain the advantage racing into upper stretch and just held FLANAGAN under pressure. The latter was reserved while angling to
the inside racing to the backstretch, continued unhurried to the second bend, swung out six wide racing into upper stretch and was going well late.
MARSHALL HILL settled outside foes in the last flight early, angled to the rail midway through the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn to upper
stretch to advance inside foes late but was outkicked by the top pair. DRAMA IN DANUBE, caught five wide between foes racing through the first turn to the
backstretch racing as part of the second flight, then continued in that path through the far turn to the lane to gain some position in an even effort.
BEERMASTER sprinted to the lead racing to the first turn a bit off the rail, set the pace to upper stretch and faltered in upper stretch. ROYAL EDITION
angled inwards to track off the first flight near the inside racing to the far turn but offered no rally. COOL EDGE, urged to a forward placing three wide
between foes tracking the pacesetter in second flight, was prompted to lodge a brief bid in that path nearing the lane but came up empty midstretch. MICA
BAY, caught four wide between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, emptied out into upper stretch. POVERTY FLATS, caught in tight quarters,
then steadied at the start, never gained contention. SIERRA HOTEL, caught six wide racing through the first turn while prompted to position in second flight,
dropped out early.

Footnotes
SKIPPY'S STRIKE broke readily to gain a forward placing three deep, shifted inwards on the first turn to stalk just off the first flight under light rating to the
second bend, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch making solid contact with YEAH YEAH but continued with a steady late response to prevail
under firm handling. AUBEY RIDGE, bumped at the start, was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground through
the far turn, came through along the rail to challenge for command nearing midstretch but was outkicked. YEAH YEAH shifted out three wide tracking off the
second flight, was prompted to advance while shifting out four wide nearing upper stretch, was bumped by the eventual winner entering the lane and
couldn't match that rival's kick. KID FROSTIE settled last to the backstretch, angled out six wide in upper stretch and made some belated progress.
ANTARCTIC tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, was fanned five wide into the lane but made no impression. PINE GROVE ROAD,
forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter in the opening half, pressed the issue on the far turn into upper stretch and gave out late. OFF THE MEDS was
settled outside foes dropping well off the second flight and failed to menace thereafter. TOWARDS THE LIGHT, restless in the gate before the start, was
urged to gain a clear advantage along the inside racing to the backstretch, dueled for command into the far turn and gave way into the lane. ALOHLOUYA
swerved out at the start bumping AUBEY RIDGE, was settled along the inside early and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
MOST AMUSING angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival, went clear racing into upper stretch and was kept to firm right handed encouragement.
MAY WE ALL, off a step slowly, quickly recovered to track just off the first flight racing to the turn, shifted out entering the lane and proved best of the others.
DYNA CAT, urged along the inside disputing the pace inside the eventual winner, gave way into the lane. GATITO was rated along the inside through the
backstretch, shifted out four wide in the lane but made no impact. BLUE ECLIPSE settled last to the turn and proved no threat. LOGAN'S HEROE tracked
off the first flight outside a rival in the opening quarter and emptied out racing into the turn.
