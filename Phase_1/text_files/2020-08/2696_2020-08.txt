Footnotes
MISSISSIPPI MUSIC set the pace from off the rail, went in the two to three path on the turn, opened up turning for home, held under steady left-handed
pressure. SARGE raced outside off the leaders, went four to five wide on the turn before shifting in three deep late on that bend, ran on belatedly. SMOOTH
BLUES stalked the pace, was three to four wide on the turn, drifted a bit in the stretch and had no extra. LINCOLN COUNTY KID broke outwardly and
steadied at the start, lacked speed despite encouragement, ran in the two path on the turn and passed a tired rival. MR. MCFEELY chased from inside,
tired.

BLACKBERRY LISA bumped the outer rival at the start, attended the pace from outside then between rivals going four deep on the turn, took charge past
the three-sixteenths, drew off under vigorous hand urging. WAGES pressed the pace from inside, saved ground on the turn but floated out a path leaving
that bend, proved no match for the winner but was second best. MEGAN'S REVENGE contended between rivals, went two wide on the turn floating out a
further path into upper stretch, had no extra for the drive. WHAT A SURPRISE switched out moving past the gap, made a bid five wide on the turn but could
not sustain the effort. ROLLWITHTHEMUSIC was bumped and steadied at the start, raced just off the leaders five to six wide on the turn and failed to
threaten.

Footnotes
LADY SUNSET sped clear soon after the start to dictate terms, went in the two path on the turn, extended the advantage slightly into upper stretch, was
wearying late but held safe. WE OUTTA HERE stalked from well off the inside, went three to four wide on the turn, gained the place. THOUGHT
I'DMISSYOU shifted in up the backstretch, went three then two wide on the turn, lost second in late stretch. FEISTY HALO was two wide into the turn
outside a rival, cleared that one and moved in a bit on that bend, offered no extra late. SPEED BUMP raced outside rivals early, dropped back a bit going
four to five wide on the turn, needed more. TOWER WAGON was bumped at the break, raced inside into the turn then switched outside a rival on that bend,
failed to rally. DIAMANTE APPEAL bumped a rival at the start, switched off the fence at the half-mile marker, fanned six wide late on the turn and was
unable to menace.

Footnotes
PACIFIC OCEAN shifted in early to be about three wide into the turn, went two to three deep on that bend, struck the lead by the top of the stretch, quickly
moved clear and held safe with little late urging. NEW YORK PROUD settled off the leaders just removed from the fence, came out a path midway on the
turn then further still turning into upper stretch to be five wide, urged along but was only second best while chasing the winner home. BAYERN TO BE WILD
settled at the rear unhurriedly, began to move out on the turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch, gained steadily but was not enough. BLAZING
THUNDER was outside rivals five abreast into the turn, shifted in on that bend four then three wide coming out, ran on in the lane to improve position.
TRUCKSTOP AFFAIR was between foes heading up the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn, failed to rally. YUUUGE PARTY set the pace
initially with moderate pressure then in the clear into the turn going in the two path through that bend, was overtaken at the top of the stretch then gave way.
SUN TREADER was urged at the break but devoid of speed, moved to the rail about the seven-sixteenths, gradually moved out on the turn to be four wide
by the three-sixteenths, ran on to pass tired rivals. WILD DANCER chased the pace from outside, shifted in entering the turn, came up empty. NAVAJO
RUG hesitated at the start, moved up a bit early in the three path into the turn, shifted in on that bend, dropped back and tired.

SHARPSHOOTINGEORGE settled into stride well back of the leaders in the two to three path on the first turn, moved out four wide leaving that bend,
began to advance outside rivals four then five wide on the far turn, lugged in a bit in upper- to mid-stretch having taken over the lead, held from TRUST N
PRAYER, who raced far back early and outside a rival two to three wide, given some encouragement up the backstretch and advanced while moving out
from two to four wide on the far turn, was in a bit tight between foes in mid-stretch and kept on to narrowly miss. RIO CUTIE switched outside the pacesetter
into the first turn going in about the two then three path on that bend, continued the chase up the backstretch racing off the inside, advanced three wide on
the far turn, had a brief lead about the top of the stretch but was outkicked. TRACTOR MAN was urged at the break and responded to speed clear dictating
terms in the two to three path, began to weaken on the far turn and gave way in the stretch. ATTILA'S FLAG raced outside in the four path through the early
going, moved in up the backstretch going three then two deep on the far turn and to the rail by upper stretch while advancing but could not sustain the effort
and flattened out. GATLING GOLD shifted in early going in the two path into the first turn, moved nearer the rail up the backstretch chasing the leading pair,
weakened
thereafter.
