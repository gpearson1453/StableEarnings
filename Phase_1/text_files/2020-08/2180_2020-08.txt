Footnotes
KINDERGARTENGRADER broke sharply and stalked the leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid from along the inside when
the rail opened up entering the final turn, assumed command entering the lane and inched clear in the drive. WE GOT IT COVERED away well and tracked
the dueling leader one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the
drive while drifting in late to prove clearly second best. UPTOWN FUNKY CAT rushed up from along the rail to vie for the lead entering the first turn, set a
pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, drifted off the rail entering he final turn and raced to the outside of
KINDERGARTENGRADER through the turn, was unable to match stride with that rival entering the lane, and finished two wide in the drive to hold the show
position. ACTION WANTED settled off the early leaders while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn,
angled towards the rail leaving the turn, and finished from along the inside in the stretch drive. KEEPINGTHEDREAM stumbled in the opening strides before
trailing the field into the backstretch, was always well back and never a factor. DON'TCRYFORSINDI away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the
rail entering the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of UPTOWN FUNKY CAT in the run to the final turn, but began to weaken entering the turn, and
had nothing to offer late.

LUCKY ENDING away well, and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, forced the issue two wide into the
backstretch, took a narrow advantage into the final turn, and held gamely over a determined REPRIMAND. REPRIMAND broke sharply and raced to the
lead through the first turn while racing one out from the rail, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, battled through the
final turn from the inside of LUCKY ENDING, and just missed while battling gamely from along the rail in the solid effort. HE'S GOT EGO settled well off the
early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide
in the drive while laying in late. CAUSIN' HAVOC settled well off the early pace while racing two wide into the stretch the first time, trailed the field in the run
to the final turn, rallied one out from the rail through the turn, and finished two wide in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. VOLO VELOCE
away alertly and stalked the leader two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch and into
the final turn, but was outfinished late. SMART DEAL rushed up from along the rail through the first turn, before easing into a tracking trip, struggled to
maintain his position in the run to the final turn, and faded in the late stages.

PORTER GENT away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressed pace from along the inside in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, took a narrow lead into the stretch and inched clear late. CASCADE BILLY broke sharply and dueled for the lead from
between rivals entering the first turn, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and while unable to
match strides with PORTER GENT late, finished gamely to prove second best. BAKTURA away alertly and pressed the leaders three wide into the
backstretch, struggled to keep pace with the top pair approaching the final turn, rallied two out from the rail through the turn, and finished evenly in the drive
from just off the rail. EL NOBLE stalked the contacted early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied from along the rail
through the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. ERLICH stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch
while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. TORINO GRAND was
squeezed at the start from between rivals and trailed the field into the first turn while saving ground along the inside, rallied from along the inside entering
the final turn, but needed more when called upon.

DAKATI tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide from between rivals through the final turn, and
closed tenaciously one out from the rail in the drive to prevail. CHEF lagged well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three out from the rail in the drive to just miss. QUAGMIRE away alertly and stalked
the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive in an
even effort. JAY LOST CONTROL broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, battled for the lead from along the rail
through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly in deep stretch. SEA CADET settled off the early pacesetters while racing one out from the rail, rallied two
wide entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive while unable to threaten. RED HOT RIO lagged well off the early pace while racing one out
from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact. TITUS COMMAND away well and stalked the
leader from along the rail entering the backstretch, struggled to keep up while saving ground at the rail entering the final turn, and weakened over the final
furlong.

backstretch and assumed command approaching the final turn, repelled a challenge from SPOKANE'S GEM leaving the final turn, and drew clear late.

entering the lane, but was no match for the winner late while proving clearly second best. BOWCHICKAWOWWOW lagged well off the early pace while
saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail in traffic entering the final turn, and found his best stride late while racing two
out from the rail. KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced his bid from along the rail
approaching the final turn, checked when in tight quarters entering the turn, and then finished with late interest two wide in the drive. SOME GOLD away
alertly and raced to a clear lead entering the backstretch, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken approaching the final turn, and
faded in the late stages. I KISSED IVY settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon. RANDOM ACT settled off the early pacesetters while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied three

UNDER PAR away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, and held off a late charge by HERE'S HANNAH to prevail. HERE'S HANNAH broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while
saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, tipped off the rail soon after entering the stretch and closed with a rush. SUNBURST
away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the
drive to prove best of the rest. WARRIOR'S PROMISE settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along
the inside entering the final turn, and found her best stride late while finishing three wide in the drive. NOTIS THE JEWELL unhurried early while dropping
back to trail, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
ACE DEUCE tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, quickly assumed command with a brisk move midway down
the backstretch, maintained a clear lead through the final turn, and widened his advantage late under confident handling. TRUPON ONLINE away well and
was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground entering the stretch the first time, rallied two wide entering the final turn, was never a threat to
the winner but proved easily second best. NEVERADOUBT away alertly and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail
through the stretch the first time, rallied three wide entering the final turn, was unable to sustain his bid late, but proved best of the rest. ACT UP settled off
the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished three wide in
the drive without threatening. PAYTON'S BEST broke sharply and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through
the second turn and into the backstretch, was quickly overtaken midway down the backside, and weakened over the final furlong.
