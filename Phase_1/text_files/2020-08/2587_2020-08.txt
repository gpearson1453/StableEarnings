narrow lead into the stretch and was outfinished. ALEUTIAN HARBOUR reserved, moved out five wide for the stretch and exhibited good late energy.
QUANA DUDE outpaced early, was swung four wide for the stretch run and finished willingly. DRASTIC chased while three wide, advanced on the turn and
came up empty in the stretch. MR. SCISSORS was forwardly placed and dropped back leaving the turn. KINGS RIDGE was void of speed. BIG MONEY
