TWO BY TWO, off a bit awkwardly, recovered quickly to stalk just off the first flight under light rating to the backstretch, continued under patient handling
into the second bend, shifted four wide nearing upper stretch while being urged to challenge for command then wrested a clear advantage racing through
the stretch under energetic handling. FRANK THE MAYOR, in touch with the first flight between rivals attending the pace in the opening half, pressed the
issue into upper stretch, couldn't match the winner entering upper stretch but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. J P WARRIOR, a bit
washy in the post parade, settled last racing well off the leaders, gradually gained position nearing the lane to split rivals just off the inside entering upper
stretch and continued well enough to earn a share. DINNER AT CRUMPIES joined the pace three deep in early stages, pressed the issue on the far turn to
upper stretch and gave way. GRAPHYTE, urged along the rail disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch.

PRINCE RAMA broke sharply, set the pace along the rail racing to the turn, went clear midway through the turn to open a commanding advantage entering
the lane and widened the margin under mild hand urging. HEAVENLY GAZEBO, urged to a forward placing three wide tracking just off the pacesetter racing
to the turn, couldn't maintain striking distance nearing the lane but edged a rival for second in late stages. GABRIEL'S LEGEND, a step slow into stride,
angled to the rail tracking just off the leaders, made brief progress to gain second racing into upper stretch but flattened out late. VIVO hesitated at the start
losing contact with the field, settled into stride, then shifted out racing into the lane to pas some tiring rivals late. SR. BOM BON was urged between foes
prompting the pacesetter racing through the backstretch but gave way early. STAY MY FAYVORITE tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening
quarter but retreated early.

OVERLY LUCKY, off a step slowly, shifted out four wide in early stages while coming under pressure to advance nearing the turn, steadily gained on the
leaders in that path racing into upper stretch, then shifted inwards under pressure but prevailed in time under firm handling. WARRIOR BOSS, restless in
the gate before the start, switched out three wide early while being prompted in pursuit of the leaders between foes into the turn, angled to the rail racing
past the quarter mile marker to bid for command inside rivals but was just outkicked. FINN COUNTRY settled last outside a rival racing to the turn, angled to
the rail nearing midstretch and found his best stride late. HENRY O'HENRY broke sharply, set the pace on a clear margin racing off the rail to the lane but
faltered nearing midstretch. RASMUS angled inwards while being urged to prompt the pacesetter racing to the turn, then to upper stretch and gave way.
DERBYS MONEYMAKER tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn and failed to menace.

MISS PERFECTA bobbled slightly at the start, was righted to gain a forward placing racing to the first turn, moved to terms with the leader attending the
pace through the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn into the lane in a prolonged drive but edged forward in time under firm handling. MR. BENZ
tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the lane and continued with interest to close the gap while
edging a rival for the place honors on the wire. MASKED sped to the lead along the rail setting the pace to the backstretch on a narrow margin, dueled for
command inside the eventual winner through the far turn to late stages in a grudging effort and weakened nearing the wire. CHATTERMAN tracked off the
first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch gaining some position but lacked the needed late kick. BROKEN KEY
tracked off the second flight three wide racing to the backstretch, was fanned four wide into the lane but came up empty in the drive. RED CORVETTE, off
slowly, was settled last and failed to menace thereafter.

FITZPATRICK joined the pace five wide early, shifted inwards racing into the turn pressing the issue three deep, edged forward to a clear advantage in
upper stretch, drifted out late making light contact with RUNAWAY READY but held that rival on a slim margin to prevail under strong handling. The latter
vied for command between foes from the outset to the turn, was eased off the pace when caught in close quarters racing into the bend, split foes nearing
the lane while shifting outside the pacesetter advancing on that rival, was brushed by that foe nearing the wire and just missed. KID'S INHERITANCE, urged
four wide between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch, angled inwards racing into the turn disputing the issue inside the eventual winner and
weakened racing into the lane. ROYALLY DECORATED tracked off the first flight six wide in early stages, made some progress four wide through the turn
to upper stretch but was outkicked in the drive. DARLA'S BIG BOY, urged along the rail pressing the pace in the opening quarter, was eased back avoiding
tight quarters racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. READS LANDING vied for command three wide between
foes in the opening stages, was taken up avoiding tight quarters racing into the turn and lacked a closing bid. FIFTHTOWNFLUSH was settled last early and
never gained contention. HISMUDDAWASAMUDDA tracked just off the first flight four wide between foes in early stages and steadily faded into the turn.

HUSH Y'ALL tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing through the backstretch to the turn, shifted out five wide nearing the lane advancing on the
leaders, then was prompted to wrest the advantage in the closing stages to go clear under firm right handed pressure. CSILLA was rated off the second
flight tracking between foes, angled to the rail nearing the turn, steadily drew into contention inside foes entering upper stretch, altered course twice leaving
midstretch but angled to the rail in time to prevail for the place honors. ARNOLD'S PATSY was rated just off the first flight while angling inside in the opening
stages, shifted out four wide to bid between foes racing into upper stretch, was held up avoiding tight quarters entering the lane, then altered out five wide in
the closing stages while being urged to regain some position late. SIDASTA, urged to the lead along the inside, disputed the issue on a narrow advantage
racing into the bend, edged clear into upper stretch but faltered nearing midstretch. SLINGSHOT MISTRESS joined the pace three wide in the opening
stages, pressed the issue into the turn, was carried out by POKEGAMA in upper stretch while shifting into the path of ARNOLD'S PATSY and soon gave
way. POKEGAMA, bumped at the start, was righted while switching outside the pacesetter to join the pace between foes, pressed the issue to upper
stretch, then drifted out under left handed pressure and quickly came up empty. TAKE ALETTER MARIA settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the
turn and failed to menace. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF ARNOLD'S PATSY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

MINNESOTA MIRACLE, forwardly placed along the inside stalking the pacesetter under light reserve, shifted out three wide on the far turn steadily
advancing to challenge, then took charge racing into the stretch to go clear under pressure. TYLER'S TEK, reserved out of striking distance while shifting
out three wide racing to the backstretch, conceded some position while angling back to the rail nearing the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch and found
his best stride along the rail in the closing stages to gain the place honors in time. EXECUTIVE DECREE, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter
racing to the backstretch, advanced to press the issue nearing the far turn, gained the advantage entering the second bend but proved no match when
confronted by the winner. SWEEPING EDGE, reserved well off the leaders while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out while making a
mild gain between foes racing through upper stretch, then angled out making hard contact with GREAT SKY in the final furlong while edging that rival for a
placing. GREAT SKY was settled between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while shifting out three deep nearing the lane, then was
bumped soundly while being forced out in the closing stages. OUTRUN THE POSSE sprinted to the lead while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a
narrow margin to the far turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. SCATTERED CASH reared at the start, settled well off the second flight and never
gained contention. MESA SKYLINE settled outside foes racing to the first turn and dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF GREAT
SKY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SWEEPING EDGE FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS
DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
BABY GORDITA broke sharply, was hustled setting the pace between foes to the turn, held sway on a clear margin into the lane and widened late under
firm urging while his rider flashed a left handed whip. COWGIRL COURT, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn,
continued in pursuit in that path to upper stretch but proved only second best. MARLEY BE GOOD tracked just off the second flight between rivals and
made an effort to improve position into the lane. ADDY PADDY was settled last to the turn and passed between tiring rivals late. CATSONG tracked off the
second flight outside foes to the turn and faded into upper stretch. GIVE EM SHADE, urged to a forward placing along the inside prompting the leader, gave
way nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
GAME DAY DECISION, urged to terms with the pacesetter three deep between foes in the opening stages disputing the pace inside that rival, shifted to the
rail dueling for command through the turn and edged clear in late stages under right handed pressure. HATTIES JEWEL tracked off the first flight along the
inside, saved ground to upper stretch and edged rivals for the place honors late. AZARUK tracked off the first flight outside foes in early stages, gained a
position three deep stalking the leaders racing into the turn, was roused to challenge in that path entering the lane but had no final kick. MASTERFUL
STRIDE, caught four wide tracking off the leaders from just out of striking distance racing to the turn, continued evenly in that path to late stages. AT IT
EARLY broke sharply, angled in forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the turn and gave way nearing midstretch. LUCKYNSUCCESSFUL was rated off
the first flight between foes in early stages and faded into the lane. AQUAMARINE switched outside foes early while dropping off the second flight, raced
wide to the lane and proved no threat.
