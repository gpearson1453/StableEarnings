Footnotes
BATTLE POINT RED was off a step slow, rushed to contend, chased the pace of ALL ABOUT TIME while racing three-wide, angled out into the stretch,
reached that foe with a furlong to run and edged away. DECKLOAD was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not
reach the winner in the drive but finished with good energy. I WORK FOR CARROTS settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn,
angled out further into the stretch and finished with a late rally. MIDNIGHT IN MAUI lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with some
late run. ALL ABOUT TIME was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, drifted out into the stretch and gave way to the winner through
the final furlong. TIZ BRILLIANT lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
DAFFODIL SWEET was off a step slow, dueled for the lead with FOR YOU ONLY from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker
and was ridden out to be kept to task. FOR YOU ONLY disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive
but clearly second best. WINDY POINT settled just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. PEARL
DRAGON lagged early, saved ground and did not reach contention. ON PURPOSE was away alertly to press the pace of the winner while racing four-wide
and weakened after going three furlongs.

IS THIS IT sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, increased her advantage through the back-stretch, drifted in from right
handed sticking nearing the three-sixteenths pole and held late. DRAGON LADY was off slow, raced unhurried early, advanced four-wide through the
second turn, could not reach the winner but was gaining on that rival late. SHOE PHONE settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the
drive and finished evenly late. SAN JUAN STORM showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and weakened. ON YOUR TOES broke
sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters.

Footnotes
MEAN SHARON sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. TRIBAL BID was off
slow then allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, lacked racing room in mid-stretch and finished well when clear. XIMENA'S HONOR was
reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, could not gain on the winner but held well for the show. JACOMINA chased the
leaders while racing four-wide throughout and stayed on well in the drive. LIBERTY FLIES was bumped at the start, chased the leaders while racing
five-wide and gave way after going three furlongs. COASTAL MIST lacked early speed, lugged out through the turn and did not menace. COWGIRL
KINGDOM was bumped at the break, dropped far back early and lagged throughout.

Footnotes
AUTUMN ARRIVES was away alertly to duel for the lead with SHE OWNS PAYNT while racing three-wide, vied with that rival through a vigorous drive and
held that rival late. SHE OWNS THE PAYNT was bumped at the break, disputed the pace with the winner from the inside, vied with that foe for a prolonged
drive and just missed. JACANA showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and was up for the show. YOU GO
GIRL was bumped at the break, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and failed to gain in the drive. SUDDENLY WINNING lacked early foot, raced
five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. LA PRINCIPESSA settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally.
CASTIELA BLAZE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GUARDINGTHEMONEY settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and finished with a late
surge to be up in time. PURE PURSUIT was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin into the stretch but could
not resist the winner late. HARNERSBACH broke sharply to press the pace while racing four-wide, stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly. NO
HARBOR IN SIGHT broke sharply then raced just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and again nearing the
sixteenth pole and finished evenly late. REDROCK TRAIL hopped at the start and was bumped, showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn
and did not threaten. MEGATRON RULER broke awkwardly and was bumped, showed brief speed and weakened. PARTY FOR ONE lacked early foot,
raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the lane and finished with good energy. JUDICIAL broke sharply to chase the leaders while
racing four-wide and failed to gain late. SECRET PARANOIA settled off the leaders from the inside, raced in tight quarters in mid-stretch and finished
willingly when clear. MIKA THE MISTRESS was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. SIERRA SUNRISE lacked early
foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and was not a factor. STARACROSSTHEWATER was away in
good order to chase the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.

Footnotes
INTELICRYPT was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear lead nearing the five-sixteenths pole, remained in control
through mid-stretch but was fully extended to hold off the late charge of TADEO to prevail by a diminishing margin. TADEO broke sharply to press the pace
of the winner while racing three-wide, angled out further in mid-stretch, rallied late and just missed. DYF was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced
off the rail through the turn and finished with good late energy. STYLE DADDY settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished
with some late run. SLEET AFLEET raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. ALIANTE was bumped at the
break, raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and did not offer a bid. ZIPPIN WINE was bumped at the
start, lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane and did not reach contention. FRONT ROW FRIENDS was bumped at
the break, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not menace. ROB'S GOT GAME was bumped at the start and steadied, raced off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
UNMACHABLE lagged early, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the lane, responded to steady urging and wore down GOLD CRUSHER in the
closing strides. GOLD CRUSHER broke in, stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, opened a clear
margin nearing the three-sixteenths pole, remained in control through mid-stretch but could not hold the winner safe late. MUNCEY was bumped at the start,
raced just off the leader from off the rail, angled out into the stretch and finished willingly. WILSON TO LOCKETT lacked early speed, raced five-wide
through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with some late run. TIG broke awkwardly, disputed the pace from the inside for a half and
weakened. MOSQUITO FLEET was bumped at the break, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.
VROYSKY was bumped at the start, dueled for the lead while racing four-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.

pressured pace for a half and weakened. BULLET EXPRESS was bumped at the break then forwardly placed, moved five-wide through the turn and failed
to rally. ROYAL BAR pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, gained a brief lead and weakened. LIL'
CHIEFTAIN broke outwardly, raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. DUDLEY STUDLEY pressed the pace from

Footnotes
BLUE CHIP BETTY was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and held off the
closing BELLE OF RAINIER to prevail. BELL OF RAINIER was off a step slow, lagged early, raced six-wide through the turn, finished full of run and just
missed. SHE'S AN EAGLE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished willingly. SHE
GOT AWAY tracked the pace of ATHLEISURE from the inside, angled out into the stretch and finished with good courage. ATHLEISURE sprinted clear
before going a quarter, raced off the rail while setting the pace, drifted in to hit rail nearing the three-sixteenths pole and gave way late. MAIKA lacked early
foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SATURNCLOUD raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually
weakened. ST. SOMEWHERE showed brief speed, steadied nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and weakened thereafter.
