Footnotes
CROOKED FINGER RAY stalked the paced between rivals then three wide leaving the bend, bumped by ZERO DOWN in upper stretch, closed outside the
leader and got up in time. LIL RICHARDS BELLO chased three deep then moved up to duel with TOUGH TO BREAK around the bend and into the stretch,
took a short lead in upper stretch, held command through the final furlong, shifted out late and impeded rival inside the sixteenth pole and was nailed at the
wire. TOUGH TO BREAK sped clear to take control, dueled around the turn, relinquished command in the lane but fought back inside and yielded
grudgingly late. ARICKAREE off slow to begin, tracked off the inside then three deep into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and finished willingly.
ZERO DOWN traveled near the inside to the lane, angled out and bumped in upper stretch, looked to rally between late but got impeded and checked inside
the sixteenth pole. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED LIL RICHARDS BELLO FROM SECOND TO LAST FOR SHIFTING OUT
AND CAUSING ZERO DOWN TO CHECK IN THE FINAL SIXTEENTH, COSTING HIM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
ALTHEA GIBSON vied three deep then moved clear and angled to the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and held well in the late stages. ALL STAR HEAT
saved ground along the fence, steered outside the leader, rallied but was too late. LAVA LANE bumped and steadied early, went three deep around the
turn, angled in upper stretch, lacked room behind horses near the eighth pole, angled to the fence and finished well inside. ELGOFRANCO vied for
command between foes early then stalked a bit off the rail into the turn, angled out into the lane and kept on. SCREAM AND SHOUT stumbled leaving the
gate, chased from the outside, angled into the two path nearing the turn, went two to three wide around the bend and weakened. SPANISH CHANNEL
steadied between rivals early then steadied briefly again at the seventh-sixteenths pole, angled four wide on the turn and improved position. STARSHIP
LEIA off a bit slow and steadied at the start, took the turn three wide then angled inward inside in the stretch and passed tired rivals. CAPITAL HEAT drifted
in and bumped rival early, chased outside a rival then four wide into the lane and weakened. BACK TO THE RIVER entered the turn three wide, angled five
wide around the bend and also weakened. SLEW'S SCREEN STAR vied for command briefly then chased inside a rival, came in tight quarters and steadied
around the bend and faded out in the stretch.

Footnotes
IMPRESSION bumped both sides leaving the gate, stalked inside, went up to challenge nearing the far turn, put in tight entering the bend but slipped
through a slim opening, headed rival approaching the quarter pole, took command and drew off under hand urging. CONCUR set the pace under pressure
early then moved clear, inched away under restraint into the backstretch, pressured into the far turn from the inside, resisted around the turn, proved no
match for IMPRESSION but held the place. LITTLE NO WAY broke in and bumped at the start, chased three then two wide on the first turn, moved out into
the backstretch then moved back inside, angled four wide around the far turn and lacked a serious bid. LEAD STAR stalked outside a rival then off the rail,
exited the final turn four wide and had little left for the stretch. UNLEASH THE TIGER bumped leaving the gate, moved out into the first turn, remained off
the rail to the stretch and never threatened. THE CREEP pressed from the outside early then chased the leader up the backstretch, dropped back two wide
on the far turn and was eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
DANCING DANA floated out at the start, stalked four deep, angled in and ranged up alongside the leader at the quarter pole, quickly cleared leaving the
bend, inched away and remained clear under a drive. RUTHIES RACER unhurried in the beginning, raced a bit off the rail then angled four wide around the
bend, drifted in at the sixteenth pole and finished well to earn the place. BIG MOON asked early, advanced off the rail, raced three or four wide into the
stretch, floated in by the runner-up at the sixteenth pole and whittle the gap on the winner late. BIG DRESS bumped at the start, saved ground into the lane,
tipped out in upper stretch then moved out further mid-stretch and weakened. SMOOTH RITHMS away quickly and crossed over to the inside, set the pace
to the turn, headed at the quarter pole and offered no resistance, tipped out in the lane and weakened in the final furlong. TAKE HER TEMP broke in and
bumped rival at the start, chased from the inside and weakened. VANNA chased outside a rival, bumped at the seven-sixteenths pole, went two wide into
the stretch and also weakened. LEMON ICE took the turn three wide and was never a factor. BROKEN SHACKLES broke out, stalked the leader three
deep, bumped with rival at the seven-sixteenths pole, raced between foes around the turn, dropped back into the lane and was eased in the drive.

Footnotes
TOO MUCH HEAVEN had early speed then dropped back to stalk outside the leader, bid outside into the far turn, took over at the quarter pole, put away
inside rival then dueled with COLOMBIAN GOLD through the final furlong and held gamely. COLOMBIAN GOLD tracked off the inside, closed in leaving the
backstretch, bid three deep around the bend, drew up on even terms in the stretch, fought to the wire but could not get by. LAVENDER (IRE) settled outside
a rival, came four wide into the stretch, finished with a late rally and earned the show. MARIAH GIRL (ARG) chased three wide to the lane and finished
evenly. A THOUSAND DREAMS stalked near the inside, moved out into the two path and lacked a bid in the stretch. INVINCIBELLA (GB) showed early
speed and moved to the inside, set the pace up the backstretch, met challenger around the far turn, lost command at the quarter pole and weakened in the
drive. Y NOT SIZZLE stalked a bit off the rail, shifted in and caused DANCEFORMUNNY to clip heels past the three-eighths pole, saved ground into the
stretch, looked to rally but lacked room throughout the final furlong. DANCEFORMUNNY tracked near the fence, clipped heels past the three-eighths pole,
tipped out into the stretch, found traffic in the lane, angled out a bit and could not advance. RED BUNTING (IRE) bumped from the outside at the start,
traveled near the back of the pack, saved ground into the lane and was never a factor. LADY NOGUEZ bumped at the start, steered to the inside then
moved a bit off the rail, came three wide into the stretch and was always outrun. SUNRISER broke in and bumped at the start then checked nearing the first
turn, raced near the back of the field and never threatened. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED Y NOT SIZZLE FROM SEVENTH TO
EIGHTH FOR SHIFTING IN AND CAUSING DANCEFORMUNNY TO CLIP HEELS PAST THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE, COSTING HER A CHANCE AT A
BETTER PLACING. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
BOUNTY OF GOLD had good early speed, set the pace with WISHFUL to the outside, dueled with that rival around the turn and through the stretch and
held gamely. WISHFUL prompted the pace from outside, dueled around the turn and into the stretch, battled through the final furlong but lacked the needed
late punch. DORITA'S LEMON tracked along the inside, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, steered out further in the lane and got up for the
show. BELLA RENELLA traveled three deep around the turn, four wide leaving the bend, came out upper stretch and lost the show. PAIGE RUNNER in
range early between rivals, chased three wide into the lane and never produced a bid. SHERILINDA flashed early speed then dropped back to chase the
top pair, traveled a bid off the rail into the lane and weakened. ZILLINDA raced between foes then two wide into the stretch and never made an impact.
POCO SUENOS dropped back early, went three deep into and around the turn, exited the bend four wide and never threatened.

Footnotes
SCARTO tucked inside, settled off the pace, steadied on the second turn, remained inside to the stretch, angled out and split foes at the eighth pole, surged
clear and held safely in hand late. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM unhurried in the beginning, saved ground along the inside, angled out in the stretch and closed
for fast for second. TRIPOLI tracked down along the inside, angled out entering the lane, bid four deep with a furlong to go but was outkicked by the top
pair. EKKLESIA chased a bit off the rail, bid three deep at the eighth pole and flattened in the late stages. I'M LEAVING YOU chased outside early then
moved clear and angled to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch and led into the stretch, headed at the eighth pole and gave way. LAST
OPPORTUNITY (IRE) tracked the pace off the inside then outside a rival, angled four wide on the second turn, came back in some leaving the bend and
failed to rally. MECKLENBURG (IRE) steadied leaving the chute, went four deep into the first turn, advanced off the rail then went three deep on the
backstretch, came three wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. BRONN stalked outside a rival then between foes, dropped back on the second
turn and tired. HAMMERING LEMON chased three wide and between foes then outside a rival, bobbled and steadied past the quarter pole and was eased
in the lane. GREAT POWER settled early, lacked room then clipped heels and fell past the quarter pole and was vanned off following the race.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT GREAT POWER CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS WHEN LACKING SUFFICIENT
CLEARANCE BEHIND RIVALS WHEN CLIPPING HEELS AND FALLING PAST THE QUARTER POLE AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE
ORDER OF FINISH.HAND TIMED

APACHE PASS settled off the pace near the fence, moved outside and took aim at the leader around the turn, gained control then drifted inward in upper
stretch, cleared and widened through the final furlong. SUEZAAANA took control early, set the pace to the turn, challenged leaving the bend, steadied when
APACHE PASS came over in upper stretch and stayed on for the place. INTO VICTORY tracked a bit off the rail on the turn, angled out in the stretch and
showed a mild response to earn the show. WINE AT SUNSET stalked off the inside and lacked response in the lane. EVENING SONNET broke out and
bumped rival, raced near the back of the field, traveled two wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. ENCHANTING MOON bumped at the start, settled off
the rail then between rivals, angled to the inside on the turn and tired in the lane. MAGICAL SMILE stumbled badly at the start, in a bit tight and steadied at
the seven-sixteenths marker, saved ground into the lane and was never a factor. FOXY CARMELA raced off the pace, went three wide into the lane and
weakened. BIG GAME PLAN traveled four deep into the turn, exited the bend four wide and also weakened. MOREAVINO broke out, chased five deep into
the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and came up empty.
