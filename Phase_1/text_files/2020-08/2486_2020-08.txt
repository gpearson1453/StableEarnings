Footnotes
FLORENCIA settled inside, squeezed through to the front on the final turn and drew away while kept to her task. LADY JOANNA broke alertly and stalked
the leaders outside, continued well but was no match for the winner. TWO GRACES dropped far behind, advanced inside then flattened out. OUR CLAIRE
BEAR vied along the rail for five furlongs and faltered. DON'TTOUCHMYSTUFF chased wide and weakened steadily. DRIVER'S LICENSE forced the
leader outside and stopped abruptly. BETTER BEGIN fanned five wide on the first turn, stopped while losing contact with her field..

Footnotes
BADUKE didn't break sharply, raced wide, looped the field on the turn, drifted out through stretch, took the lead near sixteenth pole and held on. WATCH
YOUR WORDS, three wide in top flight, also drifted out through stretch and was outfinished. KID MAC COOL, between foes, fell back slightly after a quarter
mile, found an opening between foes racing into stretch, took the lead, drifted out and battled gamely. SMART RAGS vied for command two wide and then
faded. FREE FOR NOTHING failed to menace. MAIMO vied for command four wide, dropped back, suffered an injury to his left front and was vanned off.
HOWBOUTDEMPATS broke slowly and never threatened. INCENSED, fractious in the gate, set pace in three path, stopped and was being eased.

PENANCE settled outside, bid inside on the final turn, led into the stretch and drew off under moderate urging. BIG RED SEVEN raced just off the pace four
wide, continued well but was no match for the winner. MARNESIA BIG GIRL prompted the leaders three wide , bid clear on the final turn then proved empty.
PRETTY COOL CAT was urged close up outside for half a mile and faded. DESCARADO forced the pace inside then steadily faltered. SHE MAKES ME
SMILE hustled to the lead in the two path then inside, stopped in the stretch. CHORITE broke very slowly, chased inside and was no factor. FLIPPITY FLOP
dropped back early, lost contact with her field and was eased in the stretch.

GOTTA GET AWAY three wide early then went between foes, took the lead on the final turn. STAYNSIDETHECIRCLE saved ground, fell back after a half
mile, angled out into stretch and finished fast. IMMUNITY broke slowly, saved ground, moved out and finished evenly. TRILOGY came in leaving the gate,
set the pace in the four path then faded. STORMY JUSTIN broke slowly, was hustled up and stalked three wide before tiring. MARTINI KID raced wide
while just off the pace then gave way. QUALITY ASSET showed little and then pulled up lame and was vanned off. FLAT BILL broke slowly and never
threatened. AMERICAN COUGAR was finished after a half mile.

FRANK N DUCKY dueled outside throughout and wore down the leader in the late stages in a determined effort. KIDNAPPED fractious in the gate prior to
the start, vied inside winner throughout but was outfinished late in a game try. DO IT MY WAY chased very wide early, angled inside on the turn then came
up empty. CALL ME G Q hustled close up three wide then began fading on the turn. DOCTOR DOOM broke sluggishly and climbed early, raced greenly
much of the trip while no factor. REIGNING CHAMPION dropped back after the start and was far back throughout. GRANDPA DOMINICK lacked speed
saving ground and was never in contention.

Footnotes
LIKE A PRO didn't break sharply, was two wide while outrun early, waited for racing on the turn, swung out very wide and was up in the final stride. MUCHA
MUCHACHA set the pace in the three path, drew away on the turn, had a long lead with a furlong to run, drifted out under steady pressure and was nailed
on the wire. SMOKIN PRINCESS, in the four path, swung wide into stretch, lugged in mid stretch, was straightened and gained show. GO METRO GIRL
broke slowest, raced on the rail while outrun early, split foes on the turn and then closed well inside. ANGEL RAPHAEL raced just off the rail, drifted out
leaving the turn, was in tight quarters in deep stretch and steadied final strides. TIZ A SHARPIE prompted the early pace three wide, gave way leaving the
turn. SWEET MAGIC MOMENT, in three path, dropped back to last and then passed faders. ALLEGRETTO, jostled leaving the gate, raced very wide then
lugged in. FUSI, three wide and just off the pace, tired. STAY SALTY racing inside second flight, had nothing left.

Footnotes
MADAM MEENA stalked the leader outside, took over after a half mile and drew away under moderate pressure. PROMISED STORM saved ground,
awaited room on the turn, swung wide and closed well. CAPITAL Q raced close up between rivals early and continued willingly. ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE
dropped back in the two path and lacked a solid rally. PHILADELPHIA BELLE hustled to the front inside, was collared into the far turn and faded. TIZ
GRACIE urged just off the pace wide down the backstretch and tired. DISCO DEJA VU lacked speed outside and was never a factor. JAFFLE rushed to
contention inside early then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
DOUGIE, three wide, quickly shook loose on the far turn, opened a huge lead with a furlong to run, began to shorten stride deep stretch but had more than
enough to be clear. HAPPYASCANB, never far back, eased out leaving the turn and was gaining. LITTLE LATER broke slowly, angled out very wide into
stretch and was no threat. TICKED ALL DABOXES, very wide throughout, never threatened. GALLIC WAR saved ground dueling for the early lead then
tired. RICKIE'S MELODY raced wide and dropped back steadily. ODDS ARE, very wide and not far back early, faltered. THIN SPACES showed nothing.
FIELD OFFICER, very wide, failed to be a factor. JUST EXPLODED broke slowly and didn't threaten. DREAM'N DEMON bobbled leaving the gate, chased
to the top of the stretch, gave way suddenly, was pulled up bleeding profusely from the nostrils and vanned off.
