placed along the rail on the turn, eased out some into the lane, drifted in after that bothering PIPPI and then faded. PIPPI Checked at the start, saved
ground, checked again when ASTARTE GOLD made it tight at the three-sixteenths pole and then failed to fire. LASAGNA Well placed along the three path
into the turn, continued on that path into the lane and tired. SHOPPIN FOR GOLD Saved ground, was always outrun.

ground, responded, split foes and finished well. SHOOK EM UP Two path on the turn and failed to gain. BRIAN'S LAST SONG Four wide into the turn, five
wide out of it and tired. PLAYBOY JOHNNY Tracked inside and tired. NEW STONES Three path into the turn, five wide out of it and failed to take part.
