NAMORITA was outrun to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch, checked behind rivals in mid stretch then found room, rallied determinedly and
edged away driving. GO SMILEY GO hustled to contest the pace, saved ground to the stretch, responded when set down, could not stall the winner but got
the nod for second. JUST CLASSY tracked the leaders to the turn, rallied three wide to be a factor to mid stretch then was outkicked late and just missed
second. POINT HOPE (IRE) trailed to the turn, was three wide then swung out five wide into the stretch and was making a mild bid late. LASTING LIGHT
got outsprinted to the turn, was fanned four wide and rallied to loom a threat to mid stretch then finished evenly late. BRILLIANT BIRD tracked the leaders
two wide to the stretch but could not make an impact in the drive. PRINCESS ASHLYN was used to show speed and dueled two wide to the stretch then got
oukicked to mid stretch and weakened.
