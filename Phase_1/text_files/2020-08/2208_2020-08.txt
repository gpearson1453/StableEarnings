DOCS HOLIDAY broke on the lead took command from the outset drew clear while not being asked and had plenty left at the wire. MAIUS chased the
speed while off the rail never mounted a serious bid as the winner drew clear but was clearly second best. ROCKIN O raced three wide on the turn but could
not make up ground. UZI raced along the inside and did not mount a serious rally. CRUZ'N OLLIE raced along the inside and passed a tired foe in the
stretch. MR. B. G.'S CREED raced along the inside and moved into second between calls up the backstretch and then tired on the turn.

Footnotes
WILLIAM CROTTY showed the best early speed from the gates to take the lead while just off the rail was challenged on the second turn but drew off in the
lane while not being asked to win easily. MINER'S NOTION made a move to get to the leader on the second turn in the two path but could not match strides
with that one through the lane while drifting out. PARLAY PONTI had a perfect ground saving trip and came along the inside while horses fanned five wide
turning for home and was up for third while not a serious threat to the top pair. SHAWNEE KID raced four wide nearly the entire mile and could not make up
ground. CHEAP O CHARLIE raced in the two path much of the race and never mounted a bid. HOT BLOODED SONG raced three wide the entire mile and
had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
PEARL OFTHE HARBOR was away in good order then settled along the outside while four wide came into contention turning for home and closed with a
rush as the leaders tired in the final yards to get up for the win. FANCY STOCKINGS was on the lead on the rail opened a clear lead in the stretch but tired
in the final yards. PRETTY TWISTED came into contention three wide on the turn was closest to the lead at the stretch call but could not go by and was
outfinished. WILLINLILVILLIAN was well off the pace and last on the turn came between foes in the drive and finished with interest. FOXY TWIST was well
off the pace on the inside and made a nice bid through the stretch. FOXY GIRL raced along the inside just behind the pace but faded in the stretch.
SPIRITA showed good early speed in the two path but then steadily faded. ATTITUDE AJUSTMENT raced mid pack while well off the rail and tired in the
stretch. SUN MAIDEN stumbled at the start to trail and was always well back after that. LATESUMMERAFFAIR raced mid pack for the first quarter and then
weakened. SPIRITA raced as AIM HAPPY.

GALLIFREY showed good speed in the two path took the lead in the stretch but could not hold off the winner in the final sixteenth. IMA FINAL DE BUY
showed the best early speed along the rail but tired in the stretch while easily holding third. TIZ YOUR WAY steadied after the start to fall well back came
through along the inside and finished with interest. GOVENESS SHEILA had an inside trip on the turn but lacked the needed rally in the stretch. FFURGIE
raced four wide on the turn and could not make up the needed ground. ANALYZE HER STYLE raced in the two path and lacked the needed rally.
IRREPLACEABLE was forwardly placed while four wide early and faded in the stretch. CHARMING ANGEL raced along the inside while well back and was
never a threat. TEA AT NOON raced well off the rail the entire race and was eased in the stretch and walked off.
