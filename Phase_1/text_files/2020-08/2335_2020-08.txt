raced in the three path through the drive and weakened a bit in the final stages. QUINN MURPHY settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside and
had not enough in the drive. GIOBLAST stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide in the stretch and weakened. BARBESS dropped back early,
raced evenly and had no rally. LEATHER AND LACE was slow early, saved ground and never was a factor. DAUGHTEROFDEFENCE pressed the early
leader and gave way. JUST LEAVE dropped back early and failed to respond. KARATE HOTTIE took up in the early stages, stalked the pace and tired

VISUAL MAGIC pressed the early pace, raced three wide through the lane and finished determined to prevail under all out pressure. DULCE RIDE stalked
the pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire. NAUTICAL GEM set all the pace, raced along the inside throughout and
weakened a bit in the final stages. TEXAS RAIN settled off the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch, angled six wide deep stretch and had not
enough. HI SKOOL SWEETHART dropped back early, raced along the inside and had no response. LOOKIN SHARP was slow early and never threatened.
LAGOON FALLS lacked speed and failed to have a response.
