ITASCA tracked behind the leader, was urged in the three path on the turn, led into the stretch and widened. DANCE AN IRISH JIG settled near the lead
inside, chased the winner from the rail into the stretch and was up and down late while still holding second. FAT ACCOUNT came from off the pace to rally
on the turn under urging, got up to the winner but was turned back and flattened out late missing show. REPAIR THE WORLD angled outside while off the
pace on the backsretch, lost touch with the group on the turn and passed tired horses in the stretch. RELMBUNKUS SYR went four wide on the first turn,
was under urging outside on the backstretch, stayed wiithin range to the stretch and faltered. TIZ DEJA BLUE veered in at the start, led to the far turn and
dropped out, galloping past the wire. JR'S DAY broke slow, failed to respond and galloped past the wire.

Footnotes
HOOSIER GOLD CASE sat a perfect trip today between horses, rallied three wide into the stretch, went clear through the final furlong with a good showing.
ANNOULA pressed leader throughout but had to settle for place while no match for the winner. FASHION FRAME loped on the lead to far turn overtaken
out of far turn and weakened for the show spot trough the drive. ON THE COME raced outside while evenly throughout with no late kick when needed.
SHE'S FLASHY never a factor. TRACK MAGIC raced close up early on but dropped far back quickly while in a gallop past wire.

Footnotes
RANSOM THE BULL raced mid pack early, angled out for room entering the turn, rallied in the three path, led in the stretch and cleared off in trhe final
furlong. CALBOYZEKE steadied shortly after the start, raced behind a tight field, lacked room in back of horses down the stretch, split horses late and
battled two foes to the wire, gaining the place. THIS MAN CAN was off the pace from inside, lost position on the turn, then grinded out a bid down the
stretch, getting nipped for show at the wire. GRIND LINE was behind a compact field, made a quick move on the turn four wide, got close to a minor award
but ran out of gas very late. SIR LEONIDAS was last to the stretch and improved positon. KASAMOUNT vied to the turn, stayed involved to the eighth pole
and tired. ROLLIN ON TEQUILA vied to late stretch and faded.

Footnotes
FIRST SONG went straight to the lead inside, spurted forward to repel a challenger on the backstretch, got clear on the turn and stayed game to the wire.
WHAT A RUMOR was bumped, then bobbled at the start, got up outside the winner on the backstrech, was turned back by that one but continued chasing
the winner down the stretch, re-rallying to gain some ground but second best. TAP THE TOWN stayed off the pace,, went in the six path on the turn, came
widest down the stretch and gained posiiton late. TIDE RISING was bumped at the start, chased on the turn in the three path to get closer but faded down
the stretch. YOU'RE MY BOY BLUE bumped a horse at the start, sat behind the leaders, took the rail on the turn under urging but lacked the needed rallly.
IS SHE QUICK broke outward, bumped a foe and was not a threat.

MARKET SUCCESS bumped a horse at the start, steadily advanced to the turn, raillied, came into the stretch widest of all and readily passed by foes for
the win. IBELIEVEINMIRACLES sat behind the leaders, vied briefly between horses for the lead on the turn, held the front entering the stretch, was passed
by the winner but gamely held second. TAPJEN was reluctant to load, bumped at the start, chased the pace from third, loomed boldly while three wide at
the top of the stretch but lacked the needed rally and leveled out late. ADVENTURE LAND showed to the front, vied on the rail in the turn and faltered at the
eighth pole. GRADUATEWITHHONORS raced inside mid pack and held posiiton from the turn to the wire. KAYLEE'S HOPE was bounced between horses
at the start, angled down inside shortly after the start and posed no threat.

Footnotes
LORAN HOLIDAY (ARG) sat behind the leader early, moved up alongside that one in hand, took the lead into the far turn, came five wide into the stretch
and widened under a hand ride. SOUR PEACH bumped a horse at the start, needed more while inside on the far turn, angled out in the stretch and
re-rallied to get the place spot. MOMENTA KAT was inside on the first turn, stayed off the pace to the far turn, moved up in the four path, gained second,
chased the winner, and while no match for that one, leveled out to lose the place spot late. AIKEN FOR GOLD went to the four path on the first turn, gave
chase and stayed close to the stretch and faltered. TWELVE MONARCHS raced behind the leaders and dropped back on the far turn, though improving
position in the stretch. KATIE THE CUTIE was the early speed inside and dropped away on the turn after losing the lead to the winner. GRAMS FUTURE
was well back and not a threet.

Footnotes
HYDRA'S HOPE no speed to the turn with a steady rally three wide to the turn, kept going and ran away under good handling to the wire. LEGEND BOUND
never far back in good position, came with a four wide run for place on wire. FANCY KELLY had a slow start, rushed between horses, chased leader to the
turn, put a head in at the front past the quarter pole but just lost a head bob for place on the wire with a good effort. SWING MUSIC pinched back a bit start,
converged at the half and flattened out. in the stretch run. MAYBETHEDAY no speed from inside and only passed tired ones in the stretch run. TIZ STELLA
up close to half, dropped back, came wide into stretch with no gain. PATTI GO GIRL battled from outside to turn with nothing left and dropped back.
MIDNIGHT STROLLYNN broke sharp to the lead but swallowed up by the field at the half and dropped back in the stretch.
