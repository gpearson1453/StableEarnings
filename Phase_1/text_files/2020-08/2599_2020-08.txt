Footnotes
SNELL FLICKA showed speed and set the pace, had the lead on the turn and from the three path through the stretch held sway. TRULY HONOURED was
in range, a factor on the turn and had a bid from the four path through the stretch but was no match for the winner. BLONDILIKESTODANCE was in touch
and roused from the inside on the turn but needed more. MEET YOU AT HOME settled off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the five path at the
top of the stretch was no real threat. WEDDING RING was hustled early and raced evenly on the turn but dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
FASHION FLIRT stalked the leaders, raced evenly on the turn and with a bid at the top of the stretch drew clear. TWIRLING WIND was away alertly and
had a slim lead on the turn but failed to hold. MISS TEA BLONDE was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn, angled out through the stretch and was up
for show. SAVOIA showed speed from the outside and forced the pace from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was
all out. MISS VERRAZANO was in range and a factor from the three path on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch flattened out.

Footnotes
HILLTOP HARMONY was hustled early, took command on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. KATE'S WHISTLE
was unhurried early, hustled along on the turn and finished well. SEA MY MOVES was away alertly, a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of
the stretch held show. CAPTURE YOUR HEART was in range and roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch evened out. HUSH
BUFFY was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. GET SAUCY was off the pace and showed
nothing in a dull effort. SHAMRUCKUS reared at the start, showed little and had no impact. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START LEFT THE
RESULTS AS POSTED.

Footnotes
KLASSY DELIGHT set the pace, had the lead on the far turn and with mild pressure through the stretch prevailed. CICIBONNE had no speed, moved up on
the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. VINPEARL VALENTINE stalked the early leader and was a factor on the far turn
but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. MARVEL was in range and raced evenly on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the
stretch had no late kick. EINSTEIN'S BABE was in tight on the first turn and had a good position on the far turn while all out. HOPE GARDEN was off the
pace and gained ground on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. RING IN SILENCE settled off the pace, trailed on
the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch had no rally. GABBY'S BALLERINA was well back and closed the gap on the far turn but was not a
factor. BEA COURAGEOUS was in touch early but lost ground on the far turn and was empty. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY FOR THE RUN INTO THE FIRST
TURN RESULTED IN KLASSY DELIGHT BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FIFTH FOR INTERFERING WITH EINSTEIN'S BABE.
