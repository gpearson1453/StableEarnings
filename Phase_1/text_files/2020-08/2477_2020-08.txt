QUEEN OF CORONA stalked, gained good ground at the top of the turn, grabbed the lead in the stretch and widened in the final furlong. ROBOTRON was
bumped at the start, waited, got closer on the turn and steadily advanced to pass foes that had leveled out and took second late. LIL POM POM chased the
leader from second position, battled that foe down the stretch and leveled out to settle for show. ROSEBUD'S TIGER broke sharply, led clear,, took the turn
from off the rail, dueled a foe down the stretch and gave way late. I'M EXTRAORDINARY bumped a horse at the start, chased from near the back, raced off
the rail on the turn and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
PETE MARWICK took the four path on the first turn, stayed last until the quarter pole, was shaken for run, came wide into the stretch and moved best past
the sixteenth to get by several foes. AULD CUP raced inside off the raill and off the pace, angled out in upper stretch, closed enough to take the lead after
the 1/16 pole but was nailed at the wiire by a faster moving winner. JUNKET was sandwiched at the start, stayed back to the turn, swung wide entering the
stretch and closed late to get the show spot. FLAT OUT FAST tracked in third, got passed by a horse on the turn and remained fourth to the wire.
CONGRUITY bumped a horse at the start, took the front and gave way at the sixteenth pole. LIZZY'S LURE bumped at the start, pursued a foe from

Footnotes
K FOR KATHY tracked the pace from out in the center of the backstretch, took on the leader from turn to late stretch and got clear at the sixteenth pole.
TEJATE raced as inside speed off the rail, was challenged on the turn by the winner and vied to the final furlong before yielding. READY SET GO raced off
the rail, angled outside nearing the turn in the four path, went wider into the stretch and gained some grouind in deep stretch but too late for place. PAIG'S
SONG attended the pace from the rail and faded from inside down the lane. CRYPTO'S TWIN MILL was well back, came very wide into the stretch and
improved position. AFLAXENDREAM was away last and had mild run on the turn. FLEETWOOD GRADUATE prompted the pace from inside, steadied
entering the turn, dropped back to mid pack and faded in the stretch. IMPARTIAL STORM pushed the pace for a quarter and steadily faded.
