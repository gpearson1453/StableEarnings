TWICE SMITTEN broke readily to prompt the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, took over nearing upper stretch, kicked away under firm hand urging
and widened the margin the margin. SOME WOULD SAY, urged along the inside disputing the pace inside a rival while gaining a narrow advantage, proved
no match for that foe nearing upper stretch but bested the others. MYSTIC COURT tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn, came
under pressure early but offered no closing bid. LOYAL AND TRUE stalked just off the first flight in the three path racing into the turn and gave way entering
upper stretch.

Footnotes
IMA HARLEY TOO tracked off the first flight between rivals from out of striking distance to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the far turn commencing a
steady four wide advance and produced a sustained response to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. SIERRA HOTEL, urged inside rivals
disputing the lead into the first turn, went clear racing into the backstretch, dictated the pace to the far turn, turned back a rival's challenge racing into upper
stretch, then shifted out in the closing stages while being roused to resist but couldn't fend off the winner. MORE THAN A. P., in touch with the leaders three
wide early, conceded some ground to the pacesetter into the backstretch, was urged to bid three deep between foes nearing upper stretch, couldn't match
the top pair in the drive but edged a rival for a share on the wire. TALENT AND TRICKS tracked off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane
but had no closing bid. GOLDEN SCEPTOR, in touch with the pacesetter between foes in the opening stages, stalked that rival racing to the far turn to
lodge a brief bid but proved empty in the drive. WHERE'S OLIVER was rated outside foes in second flight to the backstretch, angled in entering the far turn
but had no rally. LISTEN TO ROSE trailed throughout. The seven furlong fraction is HAND TIMED.

FUNNY FLOWERS broke readily, was urged to dictate the pace while angling to the rail racing into the first turn, opening a clear margin on the backstretch,
turned back the challenge of GOING RUNNING TOO racing through upper stretch and went clear under firm right handed pressure. The latter raced in
touch with the pacesetter in the opening stages, conceded some ground to stalk that rival to the far turn, was urged to bid for command between foes
nearing upper stretch but couldn't match the winner late. BAILDON bobbled at the start, switched outside the leaders racing to the first turn to track those
rivals from just out of striking distance, advanced three wide racing into the far turn to lodge a bid outside the top pair but soon flattened out. QUEEN
ISABELLA tracked off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. PEYTONS SKY DANCER trailed
throughout.

BORN FORCE was prompted to advance to advance on the leaders three wide racing through the first turn to gain the advantage, shifted to the rail to
dictate the pace on a narrow advantage, held sway to the third bend, dueled inside a rival nearing the lane, was headed racing into upper stretch but shifted
off the rail disputing the issue past midstretch to narrowly prevail under strong handling. WHERE'S JORDAN tracked off the second flight outside foes in the
opening six furlongs, advanced on the leaders while being fanned four wide into the lane and produced his best stride late to gain the place honors. TEDDY
TIME settled while angling inside early, saved ground throughout and found his best stride in the closing stages to advance along the rail to challenge inside
the top pair nearing the wire. NORCO, urged inside rivals prompting the pace in the opening mile, faded in late stages. BUYMEABOND tracked off the first
flight in the opening half mile, split foes to gain terms with the pacesetter with five furlongs to go, pressed the issue on the third bend into upper stretch but
came up empty late. REAL LUTE, shuffled out of close quarters at the start, settled off the second flight, angled four wide racing into the lane but made no
impact. BOXER BOY tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the third bend and gave way nearing the lane. CLASSY INDIVIDUAL, in touch between
foes prompting the pace in the opening half mile, steadily faded on the third turn.

Footnotes
SUMMER REVOLUTION tracked the leaders along the inside through the backstretch, advanced along the rail racing through the turn, took over racing into
upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. SPEEDING KID tracked the leaders outside foes racing three deep into the turn, angled inwards
entering upper stretch and edged a rival for second in late stages. ASTRONAUT OSCAR, forwardly placed three wide stalking the leaders, moved to press
the issue in that path racing into the turn to gain the advantage after a half, shifted out to the four path entering the lane and lacked the needed late kick.
DROP THE GLOVES, urged between foes prompting the pace into the turn, gave way after a half. AWESOME EMMIT settled off the leaders in early
stages, altered course to the outside avoiding a stricken foe nearing upper stretch, angled back to the rail entering the lane but lacked a late bid. FENDER
BENDER dropped out last in early stages and failed to menace. TRAPALANDA hopped at the start, was urged along the rail disputing the pace racing into
the turn, was taken up leaving the quarter mile marker when suffering an injury and was vanned off the course following the race.

AFTER RED SUN, urged disputing the pace inside rivals into the first turn, continued to dispute the issue gaining a narrow advantage racing into upper
stretch, shifted out nearing midstretch while being roused to repel a challenge from BEE BIT and held the advantage to the end under strong handling. The
latter angled to the inside tracking off the first flight into the backstretch, gained along the inside on the far turn, shifted out entering the lane to bid between
foes, was caught in close quarters midstretch but continued with a steady effort to gain the place honors. TRISH THE DISH settled between foes in the last
flight early, advanced four wide on the far turn into the lane and continued willingly to edge rivals for a share on the wire. GINGER ROSE, reserved in early
stages while angling to the inside, saved ground throughout and continued with an effort to improve position. SMOKIN HOT MOMMA, forwardly placed three
deep racing just off the leaders, moved to press the issue on the far turn into the lane and flattened out leaving midstretch. FIRST HUNTER, urged
prompting a rival's pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way into the stretch. MORNING REPORT, caught four wide between foes racing into the first
turn, dropped out early. FRIENDLY AND KIND, caught five wide into the first turn, tracked outside foes in second flight through the backstretch, was fanned
five wide into the lane and came up empty in the drive. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF BEE BIT LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED. The seven furlong fraction is HAND TIMED.

FIFTYSHADESOGRAYCE, urged disputing the pace inside foes from the outset into the turn, shifted off the rail racing into upper stretch and continued in
an extended skirmish to gamely hold the challenge of RAGING GOLD DIGGER through late stages under firm handling. The latter was settled along the
inside racing through the backstretch, advanced with a sharp move along the rail racing into upper stretch bidding for command inside the winner, pressed
the issue to late stages but proved only second best. VERY BOISTEROUS was settled outside foes racing to the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch
and continued well enough to gain a share. FASHION ROSE tracked off the first flight outside rivals, was prompted to advance four wide into upper stretch
but had no late kick. PAPA'S ISLA DOLL, forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, was eased back to track off the first flight between foes
racing into the turn but lacked a closing response. FLAN tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch to
lodge a brief bid three deep between foes entering the lane but quickly came up empty. XYLINA'S ART angled inwards in early stages to force the pace
outside the eventual winner racing into the turn and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
L' CRISTABAL angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, moved to challenge for command inside the leader racing into the far
turn, dueled inside foes to upper stretch and was driven forward under brisk pressure. DRAMA IN DANUBE, prompted to a forward placing three deep
racing to the backstretch, continued in that path into the far turn while advancing to press the issue, couldn't match the winner in the drive but edged rivals
for the place honors. FLANAGAN tracked off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, raced in
close quarters entering the lane but continued with interest to improve position. BEERMASTER, urged to the lead along the inside racing into the
backstretch, shifted off the rail after a half, dueled for command between foes on the far turn into the lane and weakened late. BRANDY CHASER broke
readily, tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the far turn, angled four wide racing into upper stretch but had no final kick. THEMANLOOK settled
well off the leaders while angling inside racing to the backstretch, gained some position inside foes into the lane but failed to seriously menace.
BIGDADDY'SFLYINGHI tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half and offered no rally. RY'S REVENGE proved no factor. COURTING
MOONLIGHT trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WORN A BIT, in touch with the leaders while angling inside racing into the turn was urged to press the issue along the rail into upper stretch, dueled to late
stages and shifted out nearing the wire brushing a rival while narrowly prevailing under strong handling. BOBBY BOOTS, urged between foes disputing the
pace, dueled for command on the turn , dispatched a rival racing into the lane, then pressed the issue outside the eventual winner to late stages but was just
outfinished while being brushed nearing the wire. J J'S WILDCAT tracked just off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and
continued with interest inside foes to prevail for a share. YESTERYEAR joined the pace three wide racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue in that
path on the turn to upper stretch and gave way. R DEJA VOO dropped back early. WILD HERCULES settled along the inside, was outdistanced leaving
midstretch but walked off under his own power.
