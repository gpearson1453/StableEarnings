CALCULATING broke outward, tracked the pace while three wide, shifted out at approaching the three sixteenth pole, drifted inward under right handed
encouragement then ranged up outside of the leader and was along in time. TROOPER JENNY sat in striking position from the two path, inherited the lead
at the three furlong marker and was caught late in the stretch. FLASHY SISTER sat just off the pace while four to five wide in the early stages and offered a
mild rally through the stretch. SOPHIA SAID WHAT settled in three wide striking position, fanned three wide into the far turn and had no response when
called upon. TOM'S LAST TRIBUTE sprinted clear in the opening stages, was unable to sustain the bid that was needed and tired early. OOPS BUSTED
settled outside and retreated early.

MUSIC AT WORK tracked the leader inside, moved up alongside SOMEONE ELSE at the half marker then gained the lead willingly, responded to looming
threat into the lane, drew clear and was kept to task. PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE under strong restraint entering the backstretch, then settled outside just off
the leader, chased the leader three wide into the lane but was no match for the winner. FLAT AS A PANCAKE last away, gained closer order leaving the
backstretch, chased three wide in the final turn then uncoiled a late bid into the stretch but was in vain. INQUISITIVE CAT sat just off the pace from the two
path, raced in close quarters around the half marker, dropped back and tired. SOMEONE ELSE showed the way into the backstretch under a strong hold,
was over taken at the half marker and stopped.

the quarter pole, closed outside and was up in time. OUR DANDY'S BOY settled early then ranged up two wide into the lane, angled to the rail at the top of
the stretch and was edged out late. FROBISHER BAY chased from the three to four path and lacked a closing response. DRAYMAGIC vied for the early

SHE LIKES TO PARTY quickly took over the early lead, maintained her advantage while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear when asked and
continued to draw off to an easy victory. COUNT ON IT sat five wide in striking range, improved position into the stretch while never threatening the winner.
SHAKEITTOTHELEFT trailed the field, launched a bid into the stretch shifting outside and passed tiring rival late. BELLS AND WHISTLES broke sharply
then contended the early pace from the two path, dropped back leaving the backstretch, chased under encouragement into the stretch and then gave way
late. FINDERS KEEPERS tracked inside, uncoiled a bid into the lane and came up empty in the drive.

DANCING WILLIE broke sharply then was out sprinted to the turn, moved up alongside WEDGE POND to challenge the lead, dueled into the lane and
pulled clear late. WEDGE POND quickest to the turn, responded to challenge from DANCING WILLIE, matched strides into the stretch and gave way
grudgingly deep stretch. OLD DOUBLE DIAMOND raced in second flight outside of SAFFRIANO, rallied through the stretch and got up for third in the final
strides. SAFFRIANO raced two wide through the turn, rallied into the stretch and kept on evenly. LADY BENGEL chased throughout inside. GRANDMA JO
never reached contention. LORD STANLEY outrun throughout. DANA SMILES offered little.

REGAL CANDY trailed the field through the backstretch, raced wide into the final turn, set sights on RISING REVOLUTION into the stretch and ran down
the leader. RISING REVOLUTION hustled away, sat just off the pace in the three path, inherited the lead at the five sixteenth pole then was showing signs
of tiring at the top of the stretch, kept on under steady urging and was caught. LIA'S ON TUNE sped clear away from the gate, was overtaken and faded
gradually inside. YORKTOWN stumbled leaving the gate, chased from the two path and was done early. AUSTIN CALLING broke slow then was hustled
into contention, dropped back wilting abruptly and was eased.

ROYAL STATUS quickly went to the front then dueled outside of KENTUCKY ROLL through the turn, drifted outward leaving the final turn, rallied outside
under encouragement and pulled clear late. KENTUCKY ROLL prompted the pace from the rail, moved up alongside ROYAL STATUS at the three eighths
marker to engage the leader, match strides into the lane then gained a short advantage with furlong left and was out finished. NO COLLUSION sat just off
the pace in the three path, chased the leaders into the final turn, launched an outside bid but was unable to improve position through the drive. LIL OL
FLATTER reared at the start then trailed the field through the backstretch, advanced inside through the far turn, lodged a bid into the lane and flattened out.
BABS DELIGHT raced wide into the far turn then uncoiled a late bid but was in vain. KISS ME CAPE settled four wide mid pack, chased approaching the
quarter pole and yielded. MARACOCA'S DREAM outrun throughout.

SMILEY went five wide into the opening turn, chased outside through the backstretch, advanced quickly outside through the far turn, ranged up four wide at
the quarter pole, rallied determinedly inside under steady urging and inched up. IMPERIAL WOOD carried out mid way through the opening turn, took closer
order leaving the backstretch, circled into the lane then dueled into the stretch outside of SMILEY and was out finished. GUNN WITH THE WIND saved
ground from the two path, gained closer order under coaxing, was gaining late and missed. MARIA'S MAGIC raced in closest pursuit of the speed duel and
passed tiring late. LUCKY LAST NIGHT vied for the early lead, dueled outside of LEGS ARE DIAMOND through the backstretch, disposed of rival at the half
marker then showed the way into the final turn, was overtaken entering the stretch and gave way inside. ALL PRADO away slow, chased along the rail
through the backstretch and offered a mild rally into the stretch. FLANDERLAND chased in second flight along the rail and retired early. ARCTIC REIGN
drifted out carrying IMPERIAL WOOD wide into the first turn and never reached contention. LEGS ARE DIAMOND vied inside of LUCKY LAST NIGHT,
match strides through the backstretch, was unable to move on with rival and faltered into the stretch.
