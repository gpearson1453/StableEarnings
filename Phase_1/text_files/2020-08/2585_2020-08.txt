Footnotes
UNCAPTURED RUBY bobbled at the break and was bumped, quickly recovered, stalked the leaders, moved up on the turn, rallied outside of DRIVE IN
entering the stretch, dug in gamely and wore down that rival to prevail. DRIVE IN dueled two wide for the early lead, briefly shook free on the turn, dug in
gamely in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly. RISEN CHANGE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane and rallied
late on the rail. TRUE PROSPERITY raced off the pace inside, then came four wide into the lane, bid and weakened. MOON OVER VICTORIA dueled
inside for the lead, then chased and gave way.

Footnotes
GILDED LADY set the pace racing with a clear lead, drifted out in front MIND OF GOLD at the furlong marker, then drifted out badly through the final
sixteenth bothering the runner up. TRAPPED N MY MIND raced off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane, rallied outside,
was bothered and carried out very wide through the final sixteenth and steadied at the wire. MIND OF GOLD was bumped at the start, chased three wide,
made a bid at the quarter pole, angled in behind GILDED LADY at the furlong marker, then rallied inside. MISS PHILLY DILLY was off a step slow, raced off
the pace inside and had no rally. AWESOMENEWYEAR chased inside, chased on the turn and tired. WICKED JANE was bumped at the start and outrun.
BAD PAY chased between rivals and faded. There was a Stewards' Inquiry, an Objection by the trainer and jockey of TRAPPED N MY MIND, along with an
Objection by the rider of MIND OF GOLD, all against GILDED LADY. After reviewing the video, the stewards disqualified GILDED LADY and placed her
second for interference in the stretch run.
