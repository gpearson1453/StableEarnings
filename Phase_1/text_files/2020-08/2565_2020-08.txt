Footnotes
SECRET OF WAR quickly took command of the race and opened up on backside, stayed along the rail into the turn and improved position, entered stretch
and opened up an even bigger lead and easily won under light urging. DIOSA tracked leader in the two path off the rail on the backside, entered turn along
the rail and into the stretch, being well clear of third place rival, rider kept her to her task finishing a clear second. SOPRESCIOUS settled off the pace along
the rail on the backside, continued along the rail through the turn and into the stretch, kept to her task in stretch and secured third. FOR MY BROTHER
settled off the pace in between rivals, entered turn two wide, coaxed for run on the turn making small progress, entered stretch in the three path, and lacked
needed response to make meaningful ground in the lane. IN IT FOR LIFE settled three wide off the pace early, entered turn three wide angled in during the
turn, entered stretch in the two path, lacked needed bid in the lane when asked. MISS SWISS stalked leader off the rail in the three path early, entered turn
in the two path, entered stretch in the three path, asked for run and came up empty.
