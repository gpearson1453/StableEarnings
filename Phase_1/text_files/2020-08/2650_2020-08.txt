SUCH GREAT HEIGHTS dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, drew clear in upper stretch under mild urging, and widened while being ridden out to
the wire. ABBY'S DESTINY stalked the leading trio of duelers four wide, produced a bid for place in midstretch while the leader kicked away, then edged
place passing the sixteenth pole to prove second best. TWISTED EMOTIONS dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace
with her inner counterpart in upper stretch, then got outfinished for place by ABBY'S DESTINY passing the sixteenth pole. HER GOLD MINE raced off of the
pace in the five path around the turn, and failed to factor. HONEST GAL dueled for the lead three wide, but failed to keep pace with her inner rivals at the
five sixteenths pole, then weakened through the lane. KOJO'S QUEEN was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
VULCAN stalked the loose leader three to two wide down the backstretch, inched forward and bid for the lead in hand at the five sixteenths pole, forged a
lead passing the quarter pole, then drew off in upper stretch under driving pressure. MISCHIEVIOUSBUD cleared early on, but was challenged by VULCAN
at the five sixteenths pole, proved no match for that foe passing the quarter pole, then tired, but held place. ASTROMAN saved ground in midpack before
shifting two wide turning for home, then stayed on mildly but did not have enough to catch the tiring pace setter for place. LOOKIN AT JUSTICE saved
ground while trailing, tipped two wide at the five sixteenths pole, then three wide turning for home, but lacked a rally. ROCKIN ALL NIGHT raced off of the
pace three to four wide, and was no factor. AIRWAR chased from midpack two wide and between horses, but weakened approaching the five sixteenths
pole, was eased through the lane, and was done early.

CIELO AZUL tracked from midpack two wide into the first turn, but got rank and shifted outside of the leaders to the four path at the seven eighths pole,
tracked down the backstretch before making a four wide bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, then dueled outside of a pair of foes through the lane
under a long drive, and cleared off late. DANANG vied for the lead two wide while a bit keen around the first turn, forged a lead while meeting bids from
mulitple foes into the far turn, was headed by both of those foes approaching the quarter pole, dug in and fought on gamely through the lane, but was
bested by the widest of the trio in the final stages while prevailing for place. FLYING SAMURAI stalked three wide, bid three wide and between horses at the
five sixteenths pole, forged a lead at the quarter pole, but failed to kick away from rivals, dueled between horses through the lane, but yielded in the final
sixteenth. WARRIOR'S REMARK was caught in the five path while far off of the pace around the first turn, and never got involved. CONSIDER had a slow
start, then failed to factor. FOREVER A CHAMP vied for the lead along the inside, but weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole. SUNSIGN was
outrun.

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN HUMOR vied for the lead inside of a trio of foes around the first turn, then held an advantage from a pair of foes around the far turn before
surging clear in upper stretch, quickly opened up, then was geared down through the final sixteenth. BLOODY MARY MORNIN prompted the pace four wide
around the first turn, then three wide around the far turn, but was no match for her inner most foe turning for home, but kept on through the lane and
prevailed in the duel foe place. QUEENOFCATNIPHILL vied two wide between horses around both turns, but proved no match for her inner counterpart in
upper stretch, then lost the duel for place with her outer counterpart in the late stages. BLACK NOVA raced far off of the pace two wide around the first turn,
but took the far turn in the four path and failed to factor. PANTERITA was off slowly, raced far off of the pace along the inside around the first turn and two
wide around the far turn, but failed to factor. KALALOU prompted the pace three wide and between horses around the first turn, took back to stalk the trio of
foes into the backstretch, but came under a drive passing the nine sixteenths pole, weakened into the far turn, and was eased through the late stages. Due
to a timer malfunction, the half mile time was omitted.

TO FAT TO FISH tracked from midpack in the four path, progressed into the far turn to make a four wide bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, forged a
lead turning for home, hung on her left lead in upper stretch causing her to lug in a few paths while drawing off, but switched leads and the furlong pole and
was kept to task to the wire. STARGAZER LILY stalked the leaders in the three path, inched forward to make a three wide bid for the lead at the seven
sixteenths pole, led between horses at the five sixteenths pole, but was headed and proved no match in upper stretch, then held place through the lane.
JULIPS HOLD tracked the pace two wide, advanced mildly in the three to four path around the far turn, but leveled off in upper stretch, and finished up
evenly. TOUCH OF BLESSING was off slowly and forced outwards a bit, trailed the field while saving ground around the turns, shifted two wide in upper
stretch, and passed tired foes for a minor reward. WHO WANTS WHAT pressed the pace setter two wide, bid for the lead between horses at the seven
sixteenths pole, vied inside of a pair of foes around the far turn, but weakened approaching the quarter pole. LADY DA DA broke outwards, raced far off of
the pace in the five path into the first turn, tucked down to the three path around that bend, but got keen when running up behind rivals into the backstretch,
then failed to factor thereafter. JOKINGLY set the pace along the inside, but was challenged by a trio of foes at the seven sixteenths pole and was quickly
headed, then weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole. MYA stalked along the inside, but was shuffled behind the tiring JOKINGLY at the five
sixteenths pole, shifted to the three then four path turning for home, and failed to make an impact.

HAPPY SONRISA tracked from off of the pace along the inside around the first turn, then two wide around the far turn, but was blocked behind foes
approaching the quarter pole, took up passing that marker, then shifted four wide turning for home, rallied to produce a bid at the furlong pole, edged an
advantage at the sixteenth pole, and cleared off. ANGEL FACE tracked from midpack along the inside, advanced in hand to stalk from the pocket around
the far turn, shfited three wide to be outside of the leaders turning for home, produce a bid and forged a lead approaching the furlong pole, but was
challenged by HAPPY SONRISA at that marker, then got bested by that foe passing the sixteenth pole. STACK SHACK stalked the pace two wide around
the first turn, then four wide and outside of foes around the far turn, but was floated to the six path turning for home by multiple rivals, failed to keep pace
with those foes in upper stretch, then stayed on for a minor reward. MISS HATTIE was off slowly and trailed the field, rallied along the rail around the far turn
to be behind the leaders in upper stretch, but was blocked behind those foes allowing others to get first run, searched for racing room before splitting foes
two wide at the furlong pole, but was outfinished for minor rewards. ATALANTA BELLE vied for the lead along the inside before taking back to stalk into the
backstretch, shifted two wide at the half mile pole, inched closer around that bend to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, forged a narrow advantage in upper
stretch, but was swallowed by foes at the furlong pole. MACHITA raced far off of the pace, took the far turn in the three to four path, waited behind traffic
turning for home, then shifted out and passed tired foes. OMI TEN shifted for the two to the five path into the backstretch while in midpack, then failed to
factor. GRACEFUL CHOICE set the pace two wide around the first turn before clearing an inner foe into the backstretch, held an advantage around the far
turn, but was headed turning for home, then weakened on her left lead. MAVALOUS MAVALOUS stalked the pace two to three wide, but was floated to the
five path turning for home, and weakened. SO FAVORITA was off slowly, raced far off of the pace two wide, and never got involved. Due to a timer
malfunction, the three quarter mile time was omitted

Footnotes
A. P. PRINCESS pressed the pace setter two wide, vied between horses around the turn, drifted to the three path passing the quarter pole, but sustained
the duel in upper stretch, battled gamely outside of her counterpart through the lane, and prevailed via a head-bob at the wire. JEANNIE'S BEEPBEEP set
the pace along the inside, dug in inside of A. P. PRINCESS turning for home, shifted outwards while dueling gamely through the lane, but lost the head-bob
on the wire. MY GOOD GIRL stalked three wide, inched forward into the turn and vied for the lead outside of a pair of foes around the bend, but was floated
to the four path passing the quarter pole, and failed to keep pace with those foes in upper stretch, then prevailed over an inner foe for show. KAY BEE GEE
brushed the gate, then pulled between horses early on to achieve inside stalking position, but failed to produce a bid in upper stretch, chased the leaders
home, and got outfinished for show. LUNA FORTIS raced off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and failed to menace. OBSOLETE saved ground,
but was outrun. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the late stretch run between the first two finishers, but the result of the photo rendered the issue
moot.

Footnotes
MOONSHINE JUSTICE cleared the field into the far turn, held a loose lead down the backstretch and under confident handling around the far turn, then was
coaxed in upper stretch, widened before being driven at the furlong pole, and held sway through the late stages. INDOCUMENTADO was bumped between
horses at the start, was caught four wide off of the pace around the first turn, then rallied along the inside around the far turn, shifted three wide turning for
home, but failed to catch the loose leader, then held place from an inner oncharging rival. PRADO'S PLAYBOY saved ground around the far turn, and rallied
inside of foes, but did not have enough to achieve place. DOUBLE ADVANTAGE tracked from midpack two to four wide around the turns, but got outmoved
by an inner foe turning for home, then kept through the lane for a minor reward. BAKER'S MAN trailed the field along the inside, took the far turn in the four
to five path, then passed tired foes through the lane. FIVE STAR COLONEL stalked the pace along the inside, engaged the loose leader two wide into the
far turn, but weakened in upper stretch. KITKAT KITTEN pulled from midpack to stalking position four to three wide around the first turn, but weakened into
the far turn. RICH KINGDOM saved ground off of the pace and never got involved. HIGHLINE BRIDGE tracked from midpack three wide, but was done
early.
