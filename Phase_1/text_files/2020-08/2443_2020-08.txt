SHOTTHRUTHEHEART tracked the pacesetter along the rail, was given cue at the three sixteenth pole then shifted out and won driving. BOUND TO BE
SMART hustled to the lead, drew clear through the turn, saw advantage diminish approaching the stretch, was under heavy urging through the drive then
was rundown in the final sixteenth and just held. LIGHT FAST FEET race in closest pursuit, responded to encouragement into the stretch, drifted out slightly
in the final furlong and missed. IMACLASSICMEN angled out entering the far turn, rallied into the stretch outside and weakened. AWESOME GIGI saved
ground inside in the opening stages and lacked a serious bid. ARIZONA GRAND lacked a clear path leaving and was outrun. GABBY hustled away and was
done early.

Footnotes
SLEWMACH sat outside in the middle of the pack, angled towards the rail entering the far turn, shifted out to the two path at the top of the lane then begin
bid and gradually wore down his rival in the stretch to get up for the win. MISTER MACHO MAN vied inside entering the backstretch, overtook the lead at
the four furlong marker, showed the way into the lane and was caught late. TIZTHUNDERINOW tracked from the four path, lodged a bid at the three
sixteenth pole and held show. TRIPLE LIVE steadied leaving the chute, raced outside through the backstretch, gained closer order through the turn and
gained ground outside. SUNNY'S BEST last away, advanced inside leaving the final turn and evened out. ADRIEN'S AURORA chased four wide through
the backstretch and came up empty for the drive. HERE COMES BARNEY contested the early pace and tired.** JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection
lodged by the rider of TRIPLE LIVE against the rider of MISTER MACHO MAN alleging interference leaving the chute was not allowed after review by the
Stewards.

Footnotes
DAD'S LEGACY broke alertly then was allowed to settle off the pacesetters from the four path, lost ground entering the far turn, chased gamely into the lane
then gained quickly at the top of the stretch and nipped the leader at the wire. COMMON KNOWLEDGE sat in striking position while three wide, ranged up
outside of SIRE MIEZIE into the lane, kept on under a drive then wrested the lead late stretch but was nipped at the wire. SIR MIEZIE sped to the front
under a snug hold, responded gamely to challenge from COMMON KNOWLEDGE into the lane, kept on gamely inside and weakened in the final yards.
BANG ON sat mid pack while five wide, shuffled back into the far turn and rallied mildly through the drive. CREATIVE LETTERS settled outside, chased
leaving the final turn and failed to threaten. IGNITE THE MOON last away and failed to recover from the start. EL DORADO STORM tracked inside,
dropped back leaving the backstretch and faded. **TRAINER OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the Trainer of BANG ON against the rider of DAD'S
LEGACY alleging interference in the far turn. After review of the Stewards the objection was disallowed as a tiring EL DORADO STORM carried out DAD'S
LEGACY causing him to bump BANG ON in the far turn. There was no change to the order of finish.

Footnotes
SARAHS ELEGANCE sat a the back of the pack racing five wide through the backstretch, circled the field into the lane, responded gamely when asked at
the top of the stretch and drove clear. SPANISH DIVA came away near then leaders, settled in the two path, launched bid into the stretch and was up in
time for place honors. PRINCESS PONTI hurried away then sat in striking position, went in pursuit of the lead, rallied between rivals into the stretch drive,
lost whip at the sixteenth pole and was bested late. CLASSIC TARTAN sprinted clear, showed the way through the final turn, was challenged by PRINCESS
PONTI and lacked the rally needed inside. BYRE DECREE hustled inside in the early stages, chased from the rail into the lane and came up empty for the
drive. SECRET PROPOSAL never far back outside, fanned four wide at the quarter pole and yielded into the stretch. METERS MEMORY never reached
contention. DANS LA ROSE was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
RUCK quickest to the rail into the opening turn, took pressure inside of KIWITAHI through the backstretch, disposed of rival in the far turn, responded to
looming threat from DOUBLE BEAR into the stretch and held under steady pressure through the drive. DOUBLE BEAR fanned three wide entering the first
turn, sat in striking distance of the pacesetters while four wide through the backstretch, took closer order at the three eighths marker then went in pursuit of
the leader, was gaining late but was unable to reach the winner. WHERE'S THE GOLD angled in entering the opening turn while four wide, chased four
wide outside of TIMELESS TALES into the lane, rallied determinedly outside and inched up for show honors. TIMELESS TALES trailed the field, saved
ground into the far turn along the rail, swung out three wide inside of WHERE'S THE GOLD, engaged in a duel through the stretch and was narrowly
denied. SMALL VICTORIES broke well then went three wide into the turn, sat mid pack while five wide through the backstretch and uncoiled a late bid in
vain. RAYREADY saved ground from the two path, chased into the lane and failed to threaten in the drive. KIWITAHI shifted out leaving the first turn then
prompted from the three path, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and was roused to no avail.

Footnotes
RAIL HUGGER saved ground along the rail, advanced inside through the far turn under coaxing then lacking running room in traffic, came into the lane two
wide under a drive after finding a seam, kept on tenaciously under a drive outside of REAL GRACE and edged away. REAL GRACE hustled away to secure
a rail position into the first turn, contended the pace inside of ROMAN STEEL through the backstretch, took pressure in the final turn, responded gamely
inside to challenge from RAIL HUGGER and was worn down late. MASKWECIS went four to five wide into the opening turn, sat mid pack outside, was
asked to quicken at the five sixteenth pole, circled into the lane under a drive and rallied determinedly outside of BARE BACK JACK for show honors. BARE
BACK JACK saved ground inside, took closer order through the far turn, raced in traffic into the lane from the rail, responded to steady urging and was
bested late for show. BIG AL'S VISION angled in saving ground through the first turn, trailed the field into the final turn then was taken outside into the lane
and was put to a drive and was kept on mildly outside foes. FLAT OUT LEADER out sprinted to the turn, stalked the pacesetters through the backstretch
while three wide, came four wide into the lane under a drive and lacked the rally that was required. DUNE D'ORO sat mid pack within striking distance,
chased at the five sixteenth pole, raced in traffic at the head of the lane and weakened inside through stretch. RYANWATER trailed the field, gained closer
order through the far turn, lacked running room along the rail at the head of the stretch and flattened. ROMAN STEEL pressured the early pace through the
backstretch and faltered into the stretch. **JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of REAL GRACE against the rider of RAIL HUGGER
alleging interference deep stretch was not allowed after review of the Stewards. No change to the order of finish.

the backstretch, was asked to quicken approaching the quarter pole the circled into the lane, closed gradually under steady urging and just missed. KICKEN

and was caught. SMALL TOWN DUDE allowed to settle inside, shifted out into lane from two path under a drive, lacked running room into the stretch and
rallied belatedly. STEELFORCE trailed the field while three wide, gained closer order under coaxing and closed late outside. AWESOME HIT tracked the
pacesetters from the three path, moved up closer then waited in the far turn, found seam into the lane then lodged a rail bid and weakened inside. VISION
