Footnotes
EXPECT OURS broke alertly, raced in the second flight off the inside, came three wide into the stretch, lugged in when roused, was straightened and
finished with good determination to be up in the waning strides. MOLLYS FLYIN HIGH with the pace up the backstretch three wide and outside, dueled
through the turn, shook off the other speed to be clear by midstretch, could not contain the winner, held sway for the place. SHACKS RIVER off a bit slow to
be last away, moved up a bit while off the pace and the inside, came three wide for the drive, rallied and finished up willingly to be well clear of the others.
REBECCA'S MUSIC vied early between foes, fell back into the turn, went evenly in lacking a late punch. SEEKING THE STARS void of speed, came six
wide out of the turn, showed some belated interest while well out in the course to improve position. NOT ENOUGH BLING broke in, was quickly
straightened to contest the pace inside, dueled through the turn inside the runner up. GRACE'S GAL settled in mid pack early, came up empty for the drive.
OUR STARLET four wide trip, tired in the drive. MY LITTLE GUERA was also finished after three furlongs.

Footnotes
ZYDECO MUSIC unhurried early, in the two path turn when beginning to advance, steered out a bit to be three wide for the drive, long drive, just up while
fully extended. GUILTY CONFESSION dueled early closest to the inside following an alert break, shook off that rival after a quarter, dueled with a second
foe through much of the turn, disposed of that rival to be well clear past the furlong marker, failed to contain the winner late, clearly second best. LA JAZZ in
the second flight early, moved up to challenge the runner up from the outside through most of the turn, could not keep up in the drive, comfortably saved the
show. TOSHITA FOREVER went evenly while saving ground. PARTY TWIST last away, trailed well back, picked off a couple of faltering rivals while never a
threat. NIN TO WIN broke back and never menaced. MORE CLEVER flashed brief speed out of the chute while outside the runner up, stopped before a
half, jogged in far back.

Footnotes
BREEZY BEE outrun early, improved a bit by a half toward the inside, two to three wide in the second turn, took over in upper stretch and drew well clear
under steady handling. MISS DAWN settled off the pace and the inside, rallied three wide out of the final turn, finished willingly to be clearly second best, no
match for the winner. KRAFT'S RATE one paced along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, along for the show late in finishing up evenly, no
match for the top two. THIS IS MY PRAYER closest to the leader early, fell back the middle half mile, improved along the inside into the lane, closest a
furlong out, flattened out to lose some position late. TUPELO HON E four wide through the first turn when well off the pace, continued outside and was four
wide again through the second bend, improved position slightly in the drive without posing a serious threat. SAY YES AGAIN sprinted well clear after the
start, held a long lead in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, headed when straightened for home then faltered. SALUTE ELLE in the second
flight for a half, gave way. OLIVIA'S DUCHESS had nothing left for the drive. CRY LIKE A BABY trailed throughout to be always outrun.

Footnotes
DE BIRD IS DA WORD closest to the dueling leaders, advanced and took over late in the final turn, dueled through the stretch, proved best while closest to
the inside in a determined effort. HONOR MY SPEED steadied just after the start when a bit rank and in some traffic, four wide into the first turn, settled onto
the backstretch, three wide advance second turn, dueled through the stretch outside the winner, outkicked by that one, clearly second best.
SINGINGINTHEWIND in the second group toward the inside, moved closer inside the winner midway on the final turn, shuffled back soon after, went evenly
in the drive to finish up best of the rest. EASTSIDE BOY void of speed off the inside, roused five wide out of the final turn, managed a mild response to
improve position slightly, no real threat. AFLEET ROGER last to leave, moved up to race in the main body, improved slightly into the lane, lacked a further
bid. SEAHAWK WAVE dueled up front along the inside through a lively set of early fractions, shook off the other speed to be clear before a half, offered little
resistance when confronted in the drive, continued weaken in the drive. CLEAR THE NILE fell back to trail after the start, failed to menace. ZARTASTIC was
finished after a half. KISS OF THE WOLF dueled up front for less than four furlongs in the two path and stopped.

Footnotes
BOSTON BIND broke on top, set the pace, bit of a breather in the turn, drew well clear in upper stretch, kept to task the final furlong. ALEX'S TURN also
away in good order, chased the winner up the backstretch off the inside, bit closer late in the turn, fell back upper stretch, slowly getting back to the winner
late, clear of the others. EIGHTS WILD went one paced throughout while four wide, long drive for the show, determined late for that position, no threat to the
top two. CAJUN DUDE second flight off the inside, three wide through the turn, outfinished for the show late. BEAUTY BOY off a step slow, raced back, five
wide exiting the turn, displayed a moderate amount of late interest to improve position. DANCEHALL JACK settled in mid pack, was not dangerous in the
drive while improving slightly. BOOTH ROAD SHINE made little impact. COWBOY CITY remained back in failing to respond when called on in the drive. I'LL
RAISE YOU in the main body for a half, tired in the drive. HALO REDDING broke back and was always outrun. ABSOLUT NEWORLEANS staged a steady
retreat.

Footnotes
EDEN GREY'S KITTEN narrowly set the early pace, dueled closest to the inside the middle half mile and into the stretch, regained the advantage when
finding more nearing the furlong marker and held that advantage to the wire. PEACOCK KITTEN close from the start, dueled into the far turn in the two path,
continued to alternate for the advantage upper stretch, could not match the winner the final furlong, held sway for the place. INVASORS WIND lacked speed
for five furlongs, came three wide when beginning to advance into the straight, finished up willingly to be getting to the top two late. KINGDOM WAY void of
speed, came four wide out of the final turn, improved position with a mild rally, no threat to the top three. BIG BOY DAVE REX in some traffic when with the
main body through the first turn, evenly paced up the backstretch and far turn, lacked a closing response in the drive. LOUISIANA MOON within striking
distance in the early going, faded. GREAT lacked a response in the drive. HE'S AN HONEST MAN tired from early effort. ROSSLARE HARBOUR last
away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE CHASE broke back, raced back off the early pace while between horses through the first turn, closer before a half, saved ground into the
stretch and staged a resolute rally up the rail to prove best. INDIUM dueled early closest to the inside, showed the way into the far turn while remaining
toward the inside, responded when challenged into the stretch, continued to hold a slight advantage past the furlong marker, allowed the winner the inside
late, proved stubborn to the end. BUCK DYNASTY narrowly showed the way early, pressed the runner up from the outside up the backstretch and far turn,
lodged a rebid while between horses into the lane, outfinished in the run to the wire. LIP SERVICE void of speed, raced four wide through the final turn
when advancing, challenged on the outside of the first flight entering the stretch, faltered the final furlong. DON'T SPLIT TENS forwardly placed early, fell
back the middle half, improved a bit in the drive without posing a serious threat. THAT'S D 'CAT broke alertly, fell back off the early pace, lost some
additional position after a half, improved position late by picking off a couple of tiring foes, never a threat. DRY WOOD CREEK four wide in the first turn
when within striking distance, maintained a forward position for a half before beginning to weaken. QUALITY PRODUCTION off a step slow, failed to
menace. RICKY DALE finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
ISLAND HIDEAWAY (GB) unhurried early, moved outside, rallied five wide into the lane, engaged the leader past the furlong marker from the outside,
edged clear. MARYWOOD pressed the leader off the inside, took over and got clear late in the final turn, continued to show the way past the furlong marker,
gave ground grudgingly to the winner, remained clear for the runner up spot. IRISH HUSTLE settled off the pace, saved ground through the final turn,
staged a mild rally up the inside to gain the show. MY LITTLE JEN settled off the pace while along the inside, steered out, came six wide into the stretch,
improved position while widest down the middle of the course. LONE STAR DIVA restless in the gate, off slowly, lagged well behind, continued to trail into
the far turn, improved position through traffic in the drive. RUBY SIOUX settled behind the pace, had little for the drive. FREDA'S SMOOTH AIR within
striking distance for six furlongs, tired in the drive. ROCK THE JUKEBOX took over past the wire the first time, clear before a quarter, set a pressured pace
into the far turn then gave way when headed by the runner up in the final turn. QUIKFAST N AHURRY lacked speed, was five wide out of the final turn
before tiring in the drive.

Footnotes
MOVE IT tracked the pace from along the inside, split foes when moving to challenge approaching midstretch, put a head in front with less than a furlong
remaining, held late while fully extended. SWINGING GALAXY void of speed, came five wide out of the turn, rallied willingly while remaining widest in the
drive, too late for the win, determined for the place. DEWEY'S LITTLE JOE broke back, raced inside, two path turn, roused late in the bend, moved out a bit
for the drive, late bid, not enough while between the top two at the wire. WESTERN STAR within striking distance off the inside, set down for the drive, bit
closer midstretch, hung the final furlong. STUNNING VICTORY last to leave, raced back and four wide into and through the turn, encountered some traffic
midstretch, improved a bit when clear. ELISHER broke alertly, pressed the issue early off the inside, dueled through the turn in the two path, briefly got clear
approaching the furlong marker, gave way. LOUISIANA JAZZ narrowly set the early pace, dueled through the turn while remaining along the rail, gave way
in the drive. GRIP TIGHT void of speed, failed to muster a rally. MISTER settled in mid pack early, tired from those early efforts. INSTAN WIND finished
early, stopped after a half and then jogged across.
