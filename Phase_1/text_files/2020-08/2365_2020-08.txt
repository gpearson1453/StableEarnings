Footnotes
BUCKLEY BAY was away alertly to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with complete authority. PLAYOFF BOUND was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, gained a striking position approaching the stretch, could not match strides with
his stable-mate but finished well to save the place. ROCKANDAHARDPLACE raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into
the lane and finished with a steady bid. SHIFTY DANCER broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going
three-quarters. MISSED THE BOAT raced five-wide through both turns, showed brief speed and weakened. ROUGH AND READY lacked early foot, raced
off the rail through the second turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
TIGER MOM was reserved just off the leaders early, waited for racing room approaching the stretch, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole, reached
the fore inside the sixteenths marker and was going away late. NATIONAL BROWSER was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with
EMMA'S A BEAST while racing three-wide, dropped off that rival in mid-stretch, could not match strides with the winner but came back to gain the place.
EMMA'S A BEAST broke sharply to dispute the pace with NATIONAL BROWSER from off the rail, edged away from that rival with a furlong to run and gave
way through the final sixteenth. STREETLIGHTROMANCE bobbled at the start then was allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled out in
mid-stretch and finished evenly late. DOUBLESHOTOFHEAVEN chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. TAPTOO settled off
the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. TOMORROW'S MINE lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a
factor.

Footnotes
MALIBU BAY was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with DOC RADKE, responded when challenged by MITCH AND JOHN E nearing the
quarter, vied with that rival and steadily drew clear. MITCH AND JOHN E was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, offered
a bid nearing the quarter, vied with the winner but could not match strides in the drive. LOLLY EXPRESS showed no early speed, raced three-wide through
the turn, reached a contending position into the stretch, failed to gain late but held on to the show. THIS GREAT NATION was forwardly placed early, moved
five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. JAVU lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. VALID
PRINCE raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. DOC RADKE broke inward, disputed the pace from the inside
for three furlongs and weakened.

Footnotes
COASTAL RUN was bumped at the start, sprinted clear before going a quarter, raced three-wide while setting the pace, remained in control through
mid-stretch and was fully extended to hold off STREET SHADOW by a diminishing margin. STREET SHADOW lacked early speed, raced six-wide through
the turn and finished with good energy to just miss. BETHEL RIDGE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out
further into the stretch and finished with a late bid. SCARRAZANO was bumped at the break, raced off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the
drive and finished with a steady bid. MALIBU MISTRESS lacked early foot, raced seven-wide through the turn and showed late interest. OREO'S DREAM
chased the winner while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. LETS DECLARE PEACE chased the leaders while racing five-wide for a
half and weakened. LOVE ON THE FLY showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

JOHN'S ON POINT was hustled along to set a pressured pace, opened a clear lead nearing the quarter, drifted out slightly into the lane and held safely to
the wire. TRUTH TO POWER raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with a steady bid.
KOWBOYKABIN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, drifted in to bump rival in
mid-stretch and finished willingly when straightened away. TWILIGHT RIDER lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in
mid-stretch and finished evenly. FRANKS FIX IT chased the leaders while racing five-wide, was pushed into rival in mid-stretch and gave way. COASTAL
JAZZ pressed the pace while racing four-wide, was bumped with a furlong to run and gave way. HOUSE OF LORDS was bumped at the break, showed no
early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. STEAL HOME settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and
weakened. ADJUDGED was bumped at the start, pulled up after the opening quarter and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
CONCERNING THE BUMPING INCIDENT IN MID-STRETCH BETWEEN KOWBOYKABIN, FRANKS FIX IT AND COASTAL JAZZ AND AFTER
REVIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
LICORICE DROP POPS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn to gain command nearing the quarter and quickly drew
off. TRUE REGARDS was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside, could not stay with the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly
second best. MOLAF lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with a steady bid. COLT FIFTY SEVEN
was bumped at the start, chased the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. ROUGH RIDE
pressed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. PEGASUS CHAMP was allowed to settle early, moved three-wide through
the turn and failed to menace. RIGGSKI settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. STANLEY RYDER raced
off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. PRINCE OF LUCK was bumped at the break, lacked early foot,
raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. RI' PIN SNAP hopped at the start, lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a
bid. SILVER SERVICE broke out to bump rival, pressed the pace from the inside for three furlongs and weakened.

Footnotes
THE PRESS settled off the leaders early, advanced five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew clear. WHEEL RALLY
tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch, gained command into the lane, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run but
could not resist the winner from over the top. WINE AT NINE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing
the three-sixteenths pole and failed to gain late. VICENTE'S SHADOW broke out, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further in
mid-stretch and finished evenly. GRINDER SPARKSAGLO was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late
response. TUMAC MOUNTAIN lagged early, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CAPITAL EXPENSE sprinted clear at once, raced off the
rail while setting the pace and weakened after going a half.

three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. THE SUPPLY PROGRAM was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide

Footnotes
BABY ROCKS stalked the dueling leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a quarter to run and drew off with complete authority.
BESOS FOR LILY broke inward then was hustled along to duel for the lead from the inside, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to hold
the place. I C FIRE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. CHANTE raced off the pacesetters early, saved
ground through the turn and failed to rally. SONGBIRD EYDIE was away in good order to dispute the pace while racing three-wide, angled out into the
stretch and weakened. WAIT AND SEE raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and
failed to menace. CALYPSO QUEEN raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. PULPIT LINE lacked early
foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. AUNTIE CHIANTI showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not
menace.
