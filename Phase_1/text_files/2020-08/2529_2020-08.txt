HIGH RISK STRATEGY unhurried to far turn, put to a drive, responded well and cleared off under good handling. KITCHI good speed to the front, could not
contain winner and battled back for place spot. ACCOUSTICAL good position throughout, rallied in the stretch but missed place on the wire. MOON
LAUNCH chased leader to quarter pole and weakened back from there. ESCALERA never factored. INDEPENDENT INDY raced erratic entire first turn with
a steady fade.

KATE'S GOLDEN DUDE raced just off the pace to the turn, rallied four wide for the lead, hooked a foe in a stretch battle and got up late for the win. SAY IT
AIN'T SO chased three wide on the turn, got into a long stretch duel for the lead and was outgamed at the wire, settling for place. SMOLTZ prompted the
pace from outside, stayed close to the eighth pole and faltered, though holding show. ST. RONANS raced well back tll the stretch, made a steady gain in
upper stretch and evened out late. WARRIOR'S DREAM was off a step slow, stayed back throughout and improved position in the stretch. NORTH
ELKHORN was urged at the start, raced in front and off the rail, dropped back on the turn and was empty in late stretch.

HAMPTON SPRING was mid pack to the turn, made a quick advance in the four path while there, led in upper stretch and drew off under some urging mid
stretch. PRINCESS ATHENA was bumped hard at the start, raced unhurried at the rear, moved up at the top of the turn, advanced down the stretch and
quickened in deep stretch for the place. BLOOD CURDLING broke outward and bumped a foe hard at the start, gradually advanced to the front to take on
the leader at the top of the stretch, was no match for that one and outfinished for second late, setlling for the show spot. BAILESTON LASSIE was the
speed inside to the stretch and faltered late. PAR FORE SUM was off slow, within range for a quarter and faded. HOWIZEE was reserved early from the
outside and close up, then dropped back to mid pack and ended up very wide near the outside rail of the stretch and faded.

ENTICING SHAQ bumped hard at the start, chased to turn, took over into stretch and sprinted away as much the best today in impressive fashion. CALEB
CAN DAB good position to stretch, could not keep up with winner while best of the rest. TORNADO KID no speed to stretch, split horses late for the show
spot. R UNCLE WILLIE no speed to the stretch, swung widest with a run to move up late while no real threat. ROAD OF DIAMONDS no speed to the turn
from rail, angled out stretch with no late gain in the final furlong. SONNYS CIGAR slammed at the start, raced up outside to the turn but shortened stride
badly in the stretch run. BOASTFUL DENIAL never a menace. JACK SPARROW was through early and dropped back readily. LIL BIT KROME chased to
quarter pole but retreated and, stopped to a walk thereafter.
