Footnotes
LIZZIE'S LAST rated a short early lead but was met at the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased
slightly outward leaving the turn and dug in under steady encouragement to get up at the wire. PAINT IT GREEN stalked the early pace two deep then took
over nearing the seven sixteenths pole, dueled clear into the far turn, came under steady encouragement leaving the turn but was nipped under the wire.
WALKNTHEPLANK settled off the pace about the three path, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path and
raced evenly through most of the stretch. QUICK ENERGY rated just off the pace off the rail the first turn, started a three wide bid toward the three eighths
pole, raced in the three path of the far turn but flattened stride down the lane. RUNNING PRAYERS saved ground off the early pace, showed little response
through the backstretch and raced at the rail on the far turn. HATTA DOUBLE saved ground.

Footnotes
HOW IS SHE steadied from tight quarters near the rail early on and angled out to settle off the pace, raced outside into the backstretch, bid toward the
seven sixteenths pole to take over four wide approaching the five sixteenths, drew off on the far turn and was steadily handled to late stretch before being
taken into hand. BUFF N was forced in early and boxed at the rail the opening turn then settled off the pace, started a bid into the far turn and took over
second inside the eighth pole. SING FROSTY settled off the earlier pace in the three and four paths then stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase
from the seven sixteenths pole, drifted a bit leaving the far turn then flattened stride. SHOOFLY PIE was crowded a bit soon after the start and raced well
back from early contention, started to pick up momentum nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the seven path and passed some rivals
widest. SPOOKY MOON came in early and settled off the pace in the three and four paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far
turn. KIM'S DIAMOND stalked the early pace from the three path, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole then faded on the far turn. BELLA
FEMMINA angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole, was caught toward the five sixteenths then faded at
the rail on the far turn.

BROTHER CORBIN rounded the opening turn about the five path and settled outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole,
raced five wide on the far turn and took the lead toward the top of the lane then dug in determinedly to hold on. RIGHTEOUS MAN entered the first turn in
the six path, though moved to the inside midway on the turn, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced three wide on the far turn, angled five wide
into the lane and dug in to take second later yards while gaining on the winner. THE SEVEN FIVE settled off the pace in the three and four paths then
dueled to the lead three wide nearing the three eighths pole, dug in at even terms from that point and remained a close factor to the finish. FEISTY AND
SASSY stalked the pace off the rail into the backstretch then challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, dueled between horses from that point but
dropped back toward the head of the lane and flattened stride the final furlong. FANCY CASTLE angled to the inside to rate the pace and was met at even
terms from the three eighths pole, dueled nearest the rail from there but dropped back into the far turn and flattened out past the eighth pole. HARBOUR
TOWN became fractious at the gate and ran loose when all the other horses were loaded. After leaving the gate, he accelerated toward contention but
faded leaving the first turn, was not encouraged down the backstretch and was eased into the lane and walked off. The stewards posted the inquiry before
making this race official, In addition, this race was hand timed.

Footnotes
PEACEFUL CHILD stalked the pace from the three path the first turn then took over nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced clear toward the three eighths,
was hand urged away on the far turn then steadily encouraged down the lane. KATALIMA raced in the four path the first turn and was well off the pace into
the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole then dug in through the lane to take second later yards. SECRET CASTLE ducked outward to make
contact with Thislillimeofmine leaving the gate then settled close inside the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but flattened
stride from mid-stretch. GATTOLOTTACHARM was bumped at the break and rounded the opening turn in the four path, bid nearing the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little more. C V'S CAMPFIRE saved ground off the pace, showed little response through the
backstretch then angled out from the mid point of the far turn and entered the stretch five wide, then passed some rivals. NAVY SWORD showed little
response past the half mile pole. THISLILLIMEOFMINE was bumped outward and into Gattolottacharm leaving the gate then rated a short lead inside, gave
up the lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole but continued chase through most of the backstretch before fading toward the far turn.

HYPOTHESIS gave chase toward mid track and rounded the turn about the five path, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and edged clear in later yards. BENNY
CHANG was hustled to the lead and set a pressured pace inside, gave up the lead mid-stretch and ceded later yards. MAJESTIC SEAS settled off the pace
then bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through most of the turn in the four path but angled to the six path into the lane and got up for third the final
yards. SIR MAJESTY pressured the pace but dropped back into the lane and flattened stride the final furlong. SCYTHE gave chase and raced at the rail on
the turn then finished evenly. DESTRUCTION chased the pace and rounded the turn near the rail then flattened stride the final sixteenth. GRANDPA LOUIE
dropped well back. TRUE CROSSING gave early chase toward the outside then rounded the turn in the four path. MAKEMIE PARK steadied leaving the
chute then never factored.

Footnotes
DEPUTY BEE was rushed to contention along the rail and, consequently, boxed in the first turn, drew to even terms nearing the three eighths pole, took the
nod into the far turn and raced clear midway on the turn then widened under steady handling. CRYPTOSONDE saved ground into the opening turn then
eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and settled for second under steady urging. MR. SNAP
angled to the inside to rate the pace, was met toward the three eighths pole and ceded the nod into the far turn, then dropped back midway on the turn,
drifted into the stretch and flattened stride. THREE CHOPT PUNCH raced well back saving early ground then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn about the three path and finished evenly. DIXIE'S CROSSING saved ground off the pace then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, raced between horses on the far turn and showed little more. FORKS OF IVY saved ground off the pace and showed little response through the
backstretch. LOVIE'S BITER angled in to stalk the early pace then gave way after the opening half mile. PAP'S LEGACY raced off the early pace outside,
picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole then weakened near the rail on the far turn. FIGHTING CHANCE checked from between horses nearing the
end of the first turn, raced outside into the backstretch and was not a factor. Due to a timer malfunction the race was hand timed.
