Footnotes
SACRED MOUNTAIN was never far back after an alert break, came out three wide on the turn while moving, took over just before five furlongs and held
stubbornly. DREAMING OF LOVE set or forced the pace along the inside and continued with good courage once displaced. DONTMESAWITHSISTER was
bumped leaving the gate, advanced four wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. CLASSY SOLUTION wasn't far back in the two path to the stretch
then weakened. STONE SCULPTOR wasn't far back inside early then tired. SENOR RICCI slow to load, broke in the air, came out, bumped
DONTMESAWITHSISTER, took turns on the front into the stretch while two wide then tired. LIFE MASTER JIM couldn't keep up.

INTERESTING LEGACY showed speed from the outset, dueled three wide, moved clear before a half then held on. BENEVOLENT PRINCE wasn't far back
early, raced the four path around the turn and gained steadily. CHEESE ON broke in the air, ducked in leaving the gate, stayed out from the rail around the
turn and couldn't gain through the lane. ZEUS ODIN was hustled inside to duel, came off the rail entering the stretch and weakened. OVERLEVERAGED
dueled two wide between rivals for about three furlongs then tired. MR. TOP FLEET bobbled slightly while breaking slowly then trailed.

two wide between horses into the far turn and gained to the end. MAIN COOL CAT wasn't far back outside early, raced three wide around the final turn and
lacked the needed closing. AGAINST THE ODDS stopped inside. TACTICAL PLAN moved outside the winner on the backstretch and was finished after six
