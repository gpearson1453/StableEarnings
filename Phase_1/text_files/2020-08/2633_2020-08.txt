Footnotes
UNRULY JULIE brushed at the break traveled evenly to the far turn firing along the inside near the quarter pole surging clear in upper stretch holding sway
in the two path. ZURLIN veered in at the break, lagging to the half responded on the far turn rallying from the rail into upper stretch chasing the new leader
home a game second best. MATZO BELLA well placed was roused to bid three deep on the far turn being overpowered from the inside in upper stretch
going evenly the final eighth in the four path. OLGA AGAIN well back early lost ground to upper stretch picking up tired ones there in the seven path.
MILLBANK MAGIC slow early saved ground to upper stretch finishing evenly along the rail. EXCEBLADES played no factor. DELICATE CHRISTY was
never involved. JOT hustled along pressured the pace to the far turn wearing out at the quarter pole. CHEERFUL CHIMES broke sharply working hard to
keep a head in front to the far turn wilting abruptly outside the quarter pole.

KEY CHEYNE hustled to the early lead set the pace being shadowed on soft splits to upper stretch digging in to turn back foe outside the eighth pole
winning clear. LIGHTNING FLASH moved on pace shadowing rival on pedestrian splits to upper stretch extending abreast foe for the drive being turned
away late. MAJOR RIDGE raced evenly making no headway to the far turn holding as best of others down the lane. ZA WOODMAN saved ground to the far
turn angling out near the quarter pole posing no menace. RED ALE folded up on the far turn. Due to a timer malfunction the quarter split was unavailable.
