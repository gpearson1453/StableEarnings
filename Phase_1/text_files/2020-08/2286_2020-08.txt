Footnotes
ANDIAMO GIACOMO broke on top, pressed the leader in the two path onto the main track, challenged that rival and took over from between foes late in the
bend, headed into the stretch by two rivals, long drive, regained the advantage inside the furlong marker and proved best in determined fashion. MR LEO in
the second flight while racing outside, advanced three wide late in the turn, challenged entering the stretch, vied past the furlong marker while widest of the
first flight, outkicked the final sixteenth. RARE STRAIN forwardly placed off the inside, challenged along the the winner late in the turn while outside that
one, showed the way into and through upper stretch, weakened from between the top two late. BUBBA SMACK off a step slow, fell far back, displayed
some late interest to improved position, not a threat to the top three. THE ROCKS CRY OUT away in good order, showed the way out of the chute,
continued to set the pace up the backstretch and into the turn, gave way when headed late in the bend, drifted out drive while continuing to fade. RAGING
MOON settled well off the early pace, had nothing for the drive. ESCAPE THE GALAXY broke back and was finished early.

Footnotes
KRIS T. settled off the early pace three wide, chased the leader up the backstretch, began to advance on that one through the second turn, collared her
past the furlong marker and drove clear. CHARZEE BABY moved up the inside to be clear in the first turn, set a lively set of fractions while maintaining a
large advantage the middle half mile, offered brief resistance to the winner when that one came alongside approaching the furlong marker, proved no match
late, clearly second best. BERNADETTES VISION went one paced throughout racing off the inside to finish up best of the rest. COSTA SUGAR lacked
early foot, continued back up the backstretch, four wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. ROSECOLOREDGLASSES chased the runner up early, beat a
steady retreat after a half. YANKEE'S FANNY was always outrun while racing well wide. CHARMIN DIXIE off a step slow, bore out into the first turn when
well back, eventually pulled up before four furlongs, walked back.

GET DIRECTIONS broke on top, clear out of the chute, continued to lead by daylight through the turn, extended that advantage upper stretch and was kept
task in the run to the wire. SLINGSHOTSLEW chased the winner throughout, could do little with that rival in the drive, fully extended to hold the place. LA
JAZZ back early, moved closer to the second flight out of the turn, continued to advance on the runner up as was slowly getting to that one late. CRIDER
CHASE went one paced throughout to come up empty for the drive. PEEKER DANCE off a step slow, moved out and up to the middle of the pack, four wide
turning for home, tired through the lane. BE A BANDIT raced in the main body early, steadily faded before a half, well beaten. LARK'S GOLDDIGGER
trailed early, never close, jogged accross. CAST YOUR CROWN fell further and further back after the start, showed little, jogged in.

Footnotes
CHIEF ENVOY forwardly placed in the early going between rivals, fell back to race in the second flight after a furlong, moved out and came four wide when
moving back toward the front, engaged the leader from the outside past the furlong marker and wore down that rival under firm handling. REDDY TO BET
closest to the two leaders in the run up the backstretch, moved closer three wide entering the stretch, put a head in front nearing midstretch, responded
when the winner challenged from the outside soon after then gave grudgingly to that rival in the run to the wire, well clear of the others. SET HUT broke
alertly from along the inside, dueled into and through the turn, could not match strides with the top two the final furlong, comfortably saved the show. I RATE
FIRST dueled up front in the two path, gave way in the drive. HOT TEN last away, trailed throughout to be always outrun.

Footnotes
BREEZIN BYE YOU unhurried early inside, moved closer along the rail into the turn, waited midway on the bend, moved out three wide for room, split foes
into the lane, vied closest to the inside past the furlong marker, edged clear. FLASH ANNIE in the main body for a half outside, advanced into a challenging
position while four wide late in the turn, vied through upper stretch, could not match the winner late, edged clear for the place. TOSHITA FOREVER lacked
early foot, moved closer late on the backstretch, moved out to be five wide when continuing to move closer while outside the runner up turning for home,
vied with that rival and the winner while widest of the first flight past the furlong marker, flattened out a bit, far clear of the others. GO MY JULIET raced in
mid pack early off the inside, five out to six wide late in the turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a late kick. STREETTALKINHOTTIE in the flight
early, fell back in the turn, behind some traffic late in the bend, improved a bit into the stretch inside of several foes, lacked a serious bid. NONCHALANTLY
last away, void of early foot, improved position while four wide into the stretch, not a serious threat. MY PAL CHARLENE broke back, lacked speed, passed
tiring rivals while also not posing a serious threat. CAUSEWAYCAT veered out at the start to carry out FAYOLA, was straightened and moved up out of the
chute to duel up the backstretch, gave way from between rivals into the lane, continued to fade in the run to the wire. FLASH MEDIA in the second flight for
a half, gave way turning for home. MARY'S WISH broke sharp, helped set the pace for five furlongs then stopped in the drive. FAYOLA forced out sharply at
the break, remained back, trailed home to be always outrun.

Footnotes
STEPHANIES JEWEL dueled into the first turn closest to the inside, showed the way onto the backstretch, garnered a slightly larger advantage the middle
half, asked along when confronted by a pair of rivals late in that final bend, dug in through the late to hold sway to the wire while drifting in a bit late.
PLATINUM QUEEN came out a bit soon after the start to help put MIDNIGHTONTHEBAYOU and MOONRISE KINGDOM in tight, raced off the pace while
saving some ground, continued inside second turn, moved closer and lodged a mild bid inside the winner nearing midstretch, could do nothing more with
that rival the final furlong, held the place late. MIDNIGHTONTHEBAYOU in tight at the start then bumped repeatedly with MOONRISE KINGDOM past the
wire the first time, moved out to be three wide into the first turn, rank through that bend, continued to race forwardly up the backstretch, challenged three
wide turning for home, flattened out the final furlong, clear of the rest. STREAMER broke in at the start to tighten up a couple of inner rivals, continued lean
in to help keep MIDNIGHTONTHEBAYOU and MOONRISE KINGDOME in tight resulting in those two exchanging bumps, settled off the pace, lacked a
closing response to finish up evenly. REBECCA'S MUSIC dueled early outside the winner, continued to pursue that one up the backstretch, lodged a brief
bid between horses late in the final turn, faltered in the drive. MOONRISE KINGDOM in tight at the start, was jostled early and forced to steady, fell back
and remained there in failing to threaten. START OF ACTION raced back and off the pace, had nothing for the drive.

MISS NITAP away well, forwardly placed early inside, moved out, continued to track the leaders into and through upper stretch, late surge to be up late on
the outside. AUDACIOUS GIRL broke sharply, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, headed into the stretch,
regained the advantage just inside the furlong marker, led late, nipped in the final strides. SENORITA TSUNAMI broke with the field, moved up to race
closest to the leader late backstretch, dueled through the turn in the two path, put a head in front turning for home, weakened the final furlong, narrowly
lasted for the show. BODE RAE a bit fractious while loading, bumped then shuffled and steadied to spot the field a couple of lengths, raced unhurried while
saving ground turn, rallied up the rail to finish willingly and narrowly miss the show. LEFT OF THE DIAL lacked speed out in the strip, swung out further to
be six wide turning for home, picked off a couple of rivals down the middle of the strip to improve position slightly. ABIGAIL G broke out, bumped BODE
RAE at the start, raced back off the pace and lacked a rally. ITS MADISONS DOLL in the second flight while outside, tired while four wide into the lane.
HOT WINE in mid pack early while outside, also faded while four wide exiting the turn.

TACTICAL PRIORITY bothered,, broke back and steadied, saved ground off the pace, steered out to be three wide turning for home, kicked down leader,
edging clear. FATS chased the leader up the backstretch, engaged that rival to duel through the turn, put that rival away past the furlong marker, led late,
could not contain the winner, held the place. AW ITE broke out to bother TACTICAL PRIORITY, lacked speed inside, steered steadily to the outside,
finished up willingly to be closing the gap on the top two late. VICTORY TRIP broke sharp, sprinted clear soon after, dueled through the turn closest to the
inside, weakened the final furlong. D'ROCKETMAN broke back, trailed early, improved position into the lane, flattened out in the drive. PICKETT forwardly
placed early, faded. MR MAKEITHAPPEN off the pace outside, raced four wide through the turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
BOSTON BIND close from the start outside, cleared in the turn, drew out through the lane while being kept to task. SPENDAHOLIC dueled up front inside
the winner early, chased that one through the turn, proved no match in the drive, comfortably saved the place. ICE CRUSH broke back, lacked speed while
out in the strip, four out to five wide turn, displayed some late energy to be up for the show. CAT ON THE ROOF away in good order, chased the top two,
caught late for the show. DERBY DOG settled off the pace and the inside, came four wide out of the turn, went evenly through the stretch. FLAT OUT LOVE
fell back to trail into the turn, some traffic 3/8, made little impact in the drive. GREELEY CAN WIN last to leave, was never a threat. BRAZOSWILDCAT
raced in mid pack early, steadily faded.
