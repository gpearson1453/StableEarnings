Footnotes
DISCREET RANDY well placed from the outside early, chased the pace up the backstretch, inched closer entering the second turn, responded when sat
down for the drive, dueled with FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN through the drive and was just up the final stride. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN dueled from the
inside early, battled up the backstretch, shook loose entering the second turn, was engaged by the winner entering the drive and was outnodded. VALIANT
DEFENDER unhurried early from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn, responded but
could only hold the show. ONE HITTER forced the early pace outside, remained forward but came up empty in the drive. FLAMIN FIRE pressed the early
pace inside but had nothing for the drive. THREE DAY WEEKEND was no factor. SAY WHEN was no threat. AWE PATRIOT was no menace. HOLY
SPIRIT was never close. LANEBURG dueled from the outside and gave way.
