Footnotes
RAISON D'ETAT GIRL set the pace along the rail, repulsed bids around the far turn, drew clear in upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging and
held clear. NOSTALGIA stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide near the quarter pole and rallied mildly to gain the place. COLD HEARTED
WENCH settled off the pace while saving ground, bid inside in upper stretch, switched back to the left lead and flattened out late. ZOYSIA pressed the pace
two wide between foes and came up empty in the drive. BIG ANNIE raced off the pace four wide, made a middle move outside down the backstretch and
tired in the lane. WILDCAT chased the pace four wide and faded around the far turn. TEMPLE GARDEN had brief speed three wide.

FEELING MISCHIEF set the pace along the rail, drew off in upper stretch and widened while ridden out. BRAVO REGINA prompted the pace three wide,
was no match for the winner but stayed on well enough to be clear second. PALMGIRL lacked early speed, raced two wide and was along for the show.
INDIAN HEART was outsprinted early, saved ground and passed tiring rivals. STONEHARBOR BLONDE was reluctant to load, chased the pace four wide
and faded. SOME NIGHTS pressed the winner two wide between rivals and tired in the lane. JESLYN had the blinkers fly off early, chased inside and
retreated.

Footnotes
LYNCHBURG settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced between foes around the turn, tipped further out in upper stretch, closed between foes
and was up in the final strides. ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN was in range two wide, rallied inside of foes, took the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and led until the
final strides. DREAMING OF CARATS stalked the pace two wide, bid between foes in midstretch and was outkicked. FLANK SPEED pressed the pace two
wide, was floated out a bit in upper stretch and was one-paced through the final furlong. SNOW JOB was bit reluctant to load, set a pressured pace inside,
drifted out in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong. MATSUDA was pinched back at the break, raced two wide and never threatened.
TEMPTING MOMENT played no factor while racing four wide. THE FRANCHISE chased the pace three wide and faded in the lane. PERCOLATE was
outrun inside. JIMMY LEGS was outrun while racing three wide. AUBURN MILL had brief speed inside. SITTIN FROSTY bolted around the turn, was eased

and rallied belatedly. PASS IT ON settled off the pace two wide, swung five wide in upper stretch and rallied mildly. LINEA VERDE set the pace along the

finished evenly to maintain the place. JIM'S BRONZE STAR broke outwardly, raced off the pace four wide, rallied outside and was up for the show in the
final strides. JUNE ANN (IRE) tracked the pace two wide, tipped three wide in upper stretch was outfinished for the show. CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE raced two
wide and never threatened. BY THE BOOK was in range inside, was shut off nearing the five-sixteenths pole, checked and lacked a further bid. LIMON
VOLADOR was shut off at the start, raced well back three wide and never factored. NANIE'S TREASURE chased the pace two wide, came in near the
five-sixteenths pole and tired. SHYLA GIRL had only brief speed inside. RUNFASTBABY was outrun inside. LORETTAS COMITMENT was off a bit slow,

Footnotes
HYPNOTIST had early speed inside, settled back in the clear when BACK CHARGE was intent on the lead around the first turn, edged closer two wide
around the far turn, steadily gained through the lane and was up in the final strides. BACK CHARGE cleared off two wide around the first turn, set the pace
along the rail from there and led until the final strides. YES MEANS NO saved ground off the pace, angled three wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally.
GOTTAWAY saved ground off the pace, lacked a serious rally and improved position. DRILL BIT hit the starting gate and was off well behind the field, raced
two wide and failed to menace. BEYOND THE STARS played no factor while racing two and three wide. GALWAY EMPIRE was outrun while racing two
wide. NIT PICK chased the pace two wide and retreated around the far turn. REACHNFORASIXPACK was in range three wide and stopped nearing the
lane.
