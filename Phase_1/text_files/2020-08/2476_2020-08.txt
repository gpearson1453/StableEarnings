outside bid on the final turn, was turned back in mid turn, gave best stretch. MAS MISCHIEF steadied between horses early, dropped back, was advancing
inside late on the final turn when GOLD BUYER came in and took his path, regrouped and passed that tired rival. GOLD BUYER tracked leader outside,
pressed briefly three-wide into final turn, drifted in in late turn, bothered rival, faded.
