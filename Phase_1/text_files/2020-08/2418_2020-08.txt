Footnotes
SHANGHAI KEELY was up close early, quickly took command along the backstretch, opened up and drew off as an easy winner. SHE'S MY GEM was
outrun early, went five wide into the turn, was no match and finished second best. ORNAMENTAL IRON pressed the early pace, raced along the inside into
the turn, was eased back and was along for the show position. WHOLEHEARTED was taken back early, went six wide and flattened out. LAKE TIME was
void of any early speed, advanced from between rivals and offered no rally. TRUE CASTLE raced in mid pack early, went four wide into the turn and
weakened. BLUE MOONRISE tracked the early pace, went five wide into the turn and was empty. SUPER HUMOR set a pressured early pace and was
finished early. PERFORMANCE REVIEW was never a factor.
