Footnotes
NOBLE EGYPTIAN broke sharply while appearing to just pop the gate, sped away to a clear advantage racing a bit off the rail to the backstretch, turned
back a challenge on the far turn and held sway to the end under firm right handed pressure. A P IS LOOSE shied inwards at the start bumping PRIMO
TOUCH soundly, was collected to track the leaders outside a rival to the backstretch, angled inside after a half, saved ground to upper stretch and continued
with interest to secure the place honors late. DOMIKATE, forced inwards by PRIMO TOUCH, then held up at the start, was settled last to the backstretch,
swung out five wide racing into the lane and continued with interest to gain a share. CLEAR THE MINE was rated along the inside tracking just off the first
flight, was prompted to bid for command along the rail racing into the far turn but soon flattened out. PRIMO TOUCH, bumped at the start and forced into a
rival, switched out three wide while being urged to a forward placing racing into the first turn, made brief pursuit of the pacesetter to the second bend but
quickly came up empty. SKIPPY'S STRIKE angled in sharply at the break, was urged to prompt the pace between foes into the backstretch, then gave way
into the far turn.

Footnotes
FAYETTE WARRIOR, bumped at the start by PEACOCK COWBOY while forced into TRUE WEST, was quickly righted, then urged between foes prompting
the pace in the opening stages, angled to the rail disputing the issue nearing the turn, shook clear racing through the bend and held sway on a narrow
advantage to the end under energetic handling. GUSKA MON SHOES tracked just off the first flight outside foes in the opening stages, was prompted to
advance three wide racing into the turn to loom briefly outside the winner but proved no match in the closing stages. AT IT EARLY broke outwards bumping
TRUE WEST, was righted, then urged along the rail prompting the pace in the opening stages, lost some ground to the eventual winner racing into the turn
but continued evenly along the inside to late stages. NORTHERNBRILLIANCE settled off the second flight racing through the backstretch, shifted out
nearing the lane and improved position between foes. TRUE WEST, bumped from both sides, then shuffled back at the start, switched out five wide early
but failed to menace. PEACOCK COWBOY broke inwards bumping a rival, was righted to press the pace between foes to the turn but soon gave way.

Footnotes
SHE'S FIRE AND ICE, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace, took over after a half and held sway to the end under firm handling. HEY KITTEN was
rated off the second flight along the inside, switched outside foes entering the far turn and continued three deep into the lane to prevail for the place honors.
GOLDEN TAP tracked off the second flight outside foes to the first turn, steadily gained on the leader four wide after a half, was urged to lodge a brief bid
but flattened out entering the lane. STARFEST, reserved near the inside, swung out four wide racing into the lane and improved position. DRANE FAME
tracked off the first flight along the inside, was shuffled back avoiding traffic entering the far turn, then shifted off the inside nearing the lane and continued
evenly between foes. TAKE ALETTER MARIA, urged to dispute the pace along the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily faded into the far turn. EXTRA
CHROME settled outside a rival to the backstretch and never gained contention. WESTERN ATTIRE tracked off the first flight between foes to the
backstretch, angled inside racing into the far turn and emptied out into the lane. CATERINA IANO tracked the leaders three wide in second flight early,
made brief progress between foes racing into the far turn and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
GOLD AND SKOL swerved out at the start, was quickly collected to track just outside the leaders racing to the turn, advanced four wide nearing upper
stretch to challenge for command, then wrested the advantage racing through the stretch to edge forward under brisk handling. AZUSA ST. tracked just off
the first flight in the opening stages, was prompted to bid for command three wide between foes nearing upper stretch, briefly resisted the winner's bid but
proved no match late. EMMETT CAT, urged inside foes prompting the pace, conceded some position when racing in close quarters nearing the turn, saved
ground to upper stretch and edged a rival for a share. SAMMY'S NUGGET tracked off the first flight along the inside through the backstretch, swung out four
wide nearing upper stretch but had no rally. FIERCE HE BE settled off the inside racing to the turn and failed to menace. TWISTED MAGIC, urged between
foes pressing the pace through the backstretch, gained a brief lead entering the turn but faltered nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
KID FROSTIE, reserved while angling inside in early stages, saved ground to upper stretch gathering momentum, shifted out to split foes three wide in
upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail under right handed pressure. GREAT BLAKE, prompted to a forward placing along the
rail, was rated stalking just off the first flight into the backstretch, shifted out three deep racing into the lane to challenge for command, gained the advantage
between calls late but couldn't contain the winner. AUBEY RIDGE, urged between rivals, then along the inside disputing the pace into the backstretch,
dueled through the far turn, edged forward racing into upper stretch and resisted the top pair to late stages. ALL UNDER CONTROL was rated along the
inside, saved ground gathering momentum nearing the lane, then was caught in close quarters racing through the stretch while just outkicked. ANTARCTIC
tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight, continued evenly four wide into the lane. HEAT FLASH settled off the second flight racing to the
backstretch, swung out five wide nearing the lane but had no closing bid. DISCREET TIGER, urged forcing the pace outside foes to the first turn, dueled for
command to the far turn and gave way. ROCKNROLL ROCKET tracked the pace inside foes in second flight but faded early. SCOOTER'S BOY settled last
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JUST BLAZE off a bit slowly, tracked the leaders between foes in the opening furlong, angled to the rail making sharp progress nearing the bend, steadily
advanced to challenge inside the leaders leaving midstretch and came through inside GEAUXCRO to edge that foe under strong handling. The latter was
urged along the inside disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, shifted off the rail dueling for command to late stages and just missed. GIANT
GAMBLE broke sharply, forced the pace between foes, then outside a rival into upper stretch and weakened late. BURGAMEISTER, off a step behind the
leaders, was caught four. then five wide into the turn advancing as part of the second flight, was fanned six wide into upper stretch but continued with
interest to improve position. BUCKYS PICK tracked off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane and continued with an even effort. SAVED
BY ZERO tracked off the first flight three deep between foes, angled out four, then five wide racing into the lane but had no late bid. SHO POKE, urged
three wide between foes prompting the pace to the turn, gave way nearing the lane. SERENGETI CAT was off slowly and failed to menace. EPIC DRAMA,
urged four wide pursuing the leaders in the opening quarter, gave way racing into the turn.

Footnotes
TABIA ducked at the start bumping TENACIOUS MOON, was quickly righted while dropping out last, pulled his way between foes to gain a position just off
the pacesetter racing into the turn, shifted three wide entering the lane to challenge, wrested the advantage while shifting inwards leaving midstretch, then
drifted out under brisk left handed pressure in the closing stages to bump GATITO nearing the wire while just prevailing for the win. The latter raced in touch
with the leaders nearest the rail while exchanging some light contact in the opening quarter, continued under patient handling while conceding some position
to the leaders racing into the turn, shifted out three wide racing into the stretch while advancing to challenge, was getting to the leader late but lost
momentum when bumped soundly by that foe nearing the wire. TENACIOUS MOON, bumped at the start, was quickly righted, then urged between foes
prompting the pace while exchanging some contact in the opening quarter, dueled inside a rival into the turn, lost some ground to that foe racing into the
lane, then shifted out while finishing evenly late to prevail for a share. AQUAMARINE, urged four wide between foes forcing the pace racing through the
backstretch, continued in that path to the lane and had no final response. DYNA CAT, urged three wide between rivals forcing the pace on a narrow
advantage, shifted inwards nearing the lane while moving to gain a clear advantage between calls but gave out nearing midstretch. THIRTY SECONDS
OUT, caught five wide in early stages stalking just off the first flight, emptied out racing into the turn. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF GATITO
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF TABIA WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER
REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED TABIA FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM SECOND.

Footnotes
HANALEI SUN, urged along the rail disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the first turn, went clear into the backstretch, held sway on a comfortable
margin into the lane and was kept to firm hand urging. BISCOTTINI, caught four wide racing into the first turn tracking just off the second flight, was
prompted to advance three deep nearing the stretch and continued willingly to close the gap late. GREATEST GAL, forwardly placed three wide between
foes racing to the backstretch, continued evenly in late stages. SHAY'S GLORY, urged between foes prompting the pacesetter into the first turn, tracked
that foe inside foes through the backstretch and faded nearing the lane. DIGGER HEELS IN, off a bit awkwardly, tracked off the second flight outside a rival
to the backstretch but offered no rally. OAKLIE GAL was rated off the second flight along the inside to the far turn and steadily faded.
