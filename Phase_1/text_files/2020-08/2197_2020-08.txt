Footnotes
JOLLY GHAALY rated between rivals, took over when let out into the second bend, drew clear then lengthened command with little asking through the
stretch. LEFT COAST DREAMS gradually advanced between horses to take over second two wide on the second turn, drifted out midstretch, lugged in with
a sixteenth left but held second. VENKMAN forwardly placed from inside, angled out some on the second bend, came three wide into the lane, gained third
approaching the eighth pole then could only pull away from the rest. JACK N JOHN settled inside, gradually picked up his pace on the backstretch, swung
four wide entering the stretch and passed between tired ones. AMERICAN SUCCESS was an early factor from outside but began to fade after a half mile.
UNCLE PAPPY displayed early speed from inside but began to tire before finishing six furlongs.

Footnotes
BABA LOU without early speed while outside, advanced three wide on the turn, fanned to path six for room into the lane, rallied, lugged in the final seventy
yards but edged ahead in time. EL RAYO D'SHERGAR shared the lead from outside, moved in beside AGAVE KID on the bend, edged ahead entering the
stretch, was briefly clear inside the last furlong but did not have enough left in the waning yards. LINE OF DENHAMS well back early, commenced his bid
along the rail on the turn, surged the last two furlongs but was too late. AHEADOFTHEGAME forwardly placed just off or along the rail, angled out four wide
for the stretch run and found best stride too late. WAVE'NDUMONI prominent from outside, threatened three wide on the bend, fanned out to path five
entering the lane, lost his path briefly to BABA LOU with seventy yards left but lacked the extra needed in the waning yards. AGAVE KID disputed the pace
from inside, came off the rail some into the stretch and gradually wore down the last eighth. A BOLD RYDE pressed the pace between the leaders on the
backstretch, did not keep up two wide on the turn, swung out for the drive, angled out further midstretch and continued to give way. BONNIE DANCES
stayed off the inside and showed little. YO HO HO backed up from inside entering the bend, angled to the outside, came widest into the stretch and had little
left. COUNTRY RODEO rank at the break, was checked and always outrun. The rider of WAVE'NDUMONI lodged an objection alleging interference from
BABA LOU deep stretch. After their review. the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
JAGUAR RIDGE rated on the front end from inside, was roused leaving the second bend, moved clear and held off JUSTENUFFTUFF. The latter was kept
close just off the inside, fanned three wide for the stretch run, took over second, gradually drifted out under left-handed urging inside the last furlong, was
straightened in the waning yards but came up short. TABADDOL gradually retreated while toward the outside the first six furlongs, lost ground four to six
wide through the second turn then passed outside weakening rivals to gain third late. MUSIAL progressed from inside to threaten on the second bend,
fanned four wide into the lane and could not sustain his bid. WORKINGFORALIVING pressed JAGUAR RIDGE from just outside from the early going but
flattened out for the drive. BAD MOON chased from well off the inside, angled in on the second turn, advanced to midstretch then leveled off. WILDWOOD'S
AFLEET stayed off the inside and showed little. K STREET in contention while toward the outside on the backstretch, angled in to be just off the inside on
the second turn then gave way the final two furlongs.

MIZ BLUE broke inward, quickly sprinted clear, was roused upper stretch, widened command and continued to draw away under a drive the last furlong. I
LUV THIS BAR raced closest to MIZ BLUE while staying just off the inside, was no match for the latter in the lane, began to wear down inside the final
furlong but lasted for the place. CATANIA reared up at the break, leaving the gate well behind the rest, advanced from inside on the turn, swung out three
wide for the stretch run, took over third then could only just hold her position late. PALAGO chased from off the inside, was three wide on the turn, fanned
out to path five for the stretch run and showed a willingness to run the last eighth. WEST GLACIER crowded briefly at the start, failed to menace in a wide
trip. MARYS LAST SONG unruly in the gate, also broke inward, was a contender from inside on the backstretch, angled out on the bend and steadily gave
way. There was a stewards' inquiry into CANTANIA'S start but no action taken after their review.

Footnotes
ABSTRACT PAYNTER kept close between horses, commenced his bid four wide on the bend and edged ahead outside rivals inside the last sixteenth. LEE
LA DEW prominent between rivals from the beginning, advanced three wide on the bend, battled for the lead through the lane but did not have enough left
in the waning yards. BEE ATTACK showed first, shared the lead outside CHILLY RED ACCOUNT, took over on the turn, was challenged from outside in the
stretch, fought gamely but lacked the extra needed the final sixteenth. DONNER PASS was steadied back from crowding shortly after leaving the chute,
progressed two wide on the turn, loomed a serious threat along the rail in the stretch but could not sustain his bid inside the last eighth. AUNDREYA'S BOY
in contention from outside on the backstretch, did not keep up three wide on the bend, fanned out some for the drive, closed the gap upper stretch but
leveled off in the late going. BOB'S BRASS DANCER forwardly placed from outside, was five wide through the turn and also wore down the final furlong.
KEY VOYAGE fractious in the gate, moved toward the outside midway on the backstretch and failed to have a stretch bid. CHILLY RED ACCOUNT
displayed early speed from inside but began to fade before finishing three furlongs. SPANISH COYOTE stayed well off the inside until deep stretch and
showed little.

GONEGHOST broke in stride, showed the way in hand from inside, was roused into the lane, lengthened command, all out the last furlong and kept
FASCILITATOR at bay. FASCILITATOR settled inside on the backstretch, commenced his bid into the turn, gained a clear path just off the inside at the top
of the stretch, gradually closed the gap, was too late but clearly second best. DIAMOND MAXIMUS chased from outside, gained a striking position three
wide on the bend, fanned out further for the stretch run then could only make up minor ground the last eighth. YOU'RE KILLIN ME failed to menace in a
ground-saving trip. HALO HUNTER pressed GONEGHOST from just outside for a half mile then gave way for the drive.

RUDY'S BOY rated just off the inside, progressed on the turn, fanned outside HIGH HERO for the stretch run, took over inside the last eighth and drew off
under a drive. HIGH HERO broke alertly, was soon sharing the lead from outside, moved clear on the turn, was put to a drive upper stretch, no match for
RUDY'S BOY inside the final furlong but moved clear for second. DATA BREACH was sent to dispute the pace from inside, did not keep up on the bend,
still threatened with a furlong to go but flattened out instead. GALAHAD KID hesitated then made a small leap from the gate, chased from inside, angled out
on the turn, came six wide into the lane, moved out further upper stretch, steadily advanced and narrowly missed third. FAIRWAY LANE chased from
outside on the backstretch, progressed widest on the turn, was six wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. INTONATION prominent
