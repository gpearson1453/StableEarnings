BLAISING GUITAR well placed from the outside, advanced through the turn, responded entering the drive, gained a clear margin and was well clear late
while lightly roused. DISAPPROVAL dueled from the inside early, dropped back entering the turn, altered outside for the drive but was no match for the
winner while clearly second best. COMBAT COMMAND chased the early pace inside, dropped back entering the turn, responded when asked and rallied
late for the show. ALMA DERBY dueled from the inside early, remained forward for the drive but could not keep pace. KING ZIPPY was never a factor.
LUVMEWHENIMGONE was no threat. CACHITO flashed early speed and tired.

Footnotes
FOOLISH STEVE stalked the early pace from the inside, inched forward up the backstretch, advanced inside entering the second turn, altered outside for
the drive, responded when asked and was just up the final stride. BIG BOBBY BROWN dueled from the inside early, battled up the backstretch, remained
engaged through the second turn, gained a clear margin at the eighth pole but was caught late. MUCH CLASS dueled from the outside early, battled up the
backstretch, remained engaged through the second turn, remained forward but could not keep pace. SHARPENDUP forced the early pace outside but came
up empty in the drive. JAILHOUSE KITTEN was off a step slow and no factor. HE'S AN HONEST MAN was no threat. GRAY PHANTOM was never close.

Footnotes
TENPINS TEMPO stalked the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, altered outside for the drive, responded when asked and was just
up the final stride. NUN OF OURS dueled from the outside early, remained engaged through the turn, gained a clear margin at the eighth pole but was
caught the final stride. SWIFTOWN MISS chased the early pace from the inside, advanced through the turn, responded and rallied late for the show.
WILDCAT SPRINGS could only improve position. DR LIZ dueled from the inside and tired in the drive. MISS BITTERS was no factor. BOSTON CADILLAC
chased the early pace inside and tired.
