Footnotes
MYSTIC NILE settled in mid pack, closed two-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch, launched a determined drive and swept by the pacesetter in the
late stages. ROSEBUD'S HOPE took command along the rail early on the clubhouse turn, drew away and set a reserved pace, was hustled through the
stretch but failed to stay in the late stages although much the best of the rest. DESERT POEM was herded a bit outward leaving the gate, settled off the
pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn then finished gamely in vain. SILENT RESPECT settled in mid pack, raced three-wide
through the clubhouse turn, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished widest and did not menace. ALKELINE
raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail then two-wide on the far turn but was never in contention. CANADIAN MAGIC broke outward then raced in mid
pack, came four-wide through the first turn, chased three-wide on the far turn but was not a threat. SPARKLE SAMMY showed brief speed from the gate,
was headed early on the first turn, stalked the new leader, began to give way on the far turn and was eased at the top of the stretch, crossed the wire and
walked off.

came three then two-wide through the turn, forced out NOT A HOUSE FRAU a bit at the top of the stretch, chased, saw her path diminishing a bit and

Footnotes
HE'S MEANT TO BE dueled, was headed briefly on the backstretch but rebid early turn, battled to the top of the stretch and gained control, drove clear and
was all out to hold. ROBUSTO raced in mid pack, closed two to four-wide on the turn, launched a strong rally from the outside and just missed. BEL BIMBO
stalked the pace, moved from the rail to two-wide late turn, came back to the fence a furlong out and finished gamely. VICTOR'S WAY stalked the pace,
chased hard three-wide late turn, was hustled into the stretch but evened out late. EL CHAIRMAN raced in mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide late
turn, had a clear path at the top of the stretch and finished under a determined drive. LYRICAL NOTE was steadied when LEGAL GUMP came out and
bothered him at the start, settled off the pace, was hustled hard two to four-wide on the turn then rallied belatedly. MACHO T moved up and dueled from the
rail, briefly held a narrow advantage mid backstretch but was engaged early turn, battled to the top of the stretch, was quickly headed and faded between
foes. LEGAL GUMP broke outward and was steadied, settled off the pace, rode the rail on the turn, was roused approaching the stretch but had no
response once he straightened away for the drive.

raced in mid pack, stalked angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished with a determined drive. WIDE AWAKE forced
the early pace, dueled from mid backstretch, led into the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch and finished all out. ROOKIE GIRL raced in mid pack,
was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then rallied gamely. ALITTLEIRISHLUCK, pinched back early, settled off the pace, was hustled
two-wide to the rail on the turn but was never contentious. PLAY IT SMART showed speed, was engaged mid backstretch, dueled to the turn, was headed
and backed away then offered no response in the stretch.

LAPOCHKA forced the pace, chased two-wide on the far turn, kept the pressure on the leader, drew even in the late stages and prevailed under a drive.
BODE'S MAKER got off a step slowly, led early on the clubhouse turn, set a pressured pace, quickened late on the far turn, was collared in deep stretch
and was out nodded at the wire. NIGHT WATCHMAN broke inward and bumped MOON MAGIC, settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail late on the
far turn then finished gamely in vain. FEDERAL LAW hit the gate leaving and settled off the pace, closed on the backstretch, was hustled two-wide on the
far turn but evened out in the late stages. MOON MAGIC, bumped inward at the start, pressed the pace, chased two and three-wide on the far turn but failed
to menace. ROCKET PLAN raced in mid pack, came three and four-wide through the far turn then lacked a closing response. RED BO shied inward away
from MOON MAGIC at the start, settled off the pace, had a rail trip but lacked a closing response.

RECONFIGURE raced in mid pack, came through the turn two-wide and angling towards the rail, moved off the wood a furlong out, dug in, passed the
leader mid stretch and drove clear. SALIERI drew clear and set the early pace, drew away and had a comfortable lead but was passed a 16th out and held
the place. SUMERIAN BELL settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide and from the rail on the turn then closed gamely in the stretch. ALICIA'S KID raced
in mid pack, closed four-wide late turn then chased determinedly through the stretch. SWEET YARE N DIRA raced in mid pack along the rail, chased into
the stretch but evened out in the late stages. HITTERS PARK settled in mid pack, came three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished
evenly. KITCHEN FIRE showed brief speed then stalked the pace through very fast fractions, backed away late turn and lacked a rally.
