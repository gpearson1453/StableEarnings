TEENER pressed in the three path, bid on the turn to draw off and then shortened stride late but held off the closer. WHAT'S THE MOVE was unrushed
early, bid at the three-eighths pole, was blocked on the turn and in the stretch, and, when free, rallied to just miss. UNFORESEEN bid between foes at the
three-eighths pole, then offered a mild late bid. R U MIZZEN ME and CANDY BIZZNESS raced evenly. LANTORNA passd tired foes. LADY O'PRADO
stalked in the four path but faded on the far turn. LEFTATTHEALTAR led inside to the far turn.

Footnotes
KATIE GIRL tracked the trio of duelers from midpack in the three path, rallied four wide turning for home, sustained her advance inside the final furlong, and
drove past the leader passing the sixteenth pole. FRENCH VANILLA vied for the lead three wide, forged a lead from an inner foe in upper stretch, drew
clear, but was bested by an outer oncharging rival passing the sixteenth pole. ITSALLABOUTYOULOU saved ground around the turn while far off of the
pace, and rallied mildly along the rail through the lane. C J'S EMPIRE tracked from midpack in the four to five path, then kept on willingly through the lane
for a minor reward. WALLAWALLABINGBANG set the pace inside of a pair of rivals, held a lead turning for home, but was headed by FRENCH VANILLA in
upper stretch, then gave way passing the furlong pole. DYNASTY OF GOODS vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with
those foes passing the quarter pole, and subsequently weakened. SNAPASELFIE saved ground, but was outrun. MABEETHISTIME showed little.

YESTERDAYS KISSES was forwardly placed, bid for the lead into the turn and dueled with her inner foe turning for home and through midstretch, inched
away at the sixteenth pole, and just held LITTLE MAEMI's late charge at bay. LITTLE MAEMI raced far off of the pace along the inside, left the rail to pass a
tiring foe around the turn, cut the corner turning for home to pass multiple foes along the inside, rallied through the lane before shifting three wide
approaching the sixteenth pole, sustained her bid in the late stages, but missed. NATTY NORA cleared early on, dueled for the lead inside of
YESTERDAY'S KISSES after that foe bid into the turn, dug in while hanging on her left lead through midstretch, but gave way passing the sixteenth pole.
GLOWED was off awkwardly, raced off of the pace in the three path before shifting to the five path in upper stretch, and offered a mild and belated rally for a
minor reward. SALTED REVENGE tracked from midpack three wide, but lacked a kick to make a bid, and failed to threaten. READY TO MONBA tracked
from midpack in the four path, but hung on her left lead through the lane, and failed to menace. ELITE ATTRACTION was forwardly placed along the inside,
but failed to keep pace with the leaders passing the five sixteenths pole, and subsequently weakened. QUITE A MOONGLOW never involved. PRINCESS
LENNY was no factor. DOWNDELANE saved ground in midpack, but weakened.

ROGUE TOO advanced from midpack four to three wide around the far turn to produce a bid turning for home, inched a narrow advantage in upper stretch,
but sustained the duel until kicking away from his inner game foe in the final sixteenth. MONKEY MIND stalked in the three path before making a two wide
bid for the lead into the turn, forged a lead at the quarter pole, but was headed in upper stretch by ROGUE TOO, dug in gamely inside of that foe through
the lane while hanging on his left lead, but gave way in the final sixteenth. SEEDS OF TIME advanced four wide and between horses through the far turn,
and kept on through the lane to secure show. JORDAN'S KITTEN rallied five wide around the far turn to produce a bid outside of the leader in upper stretch,
but flattened out in midstretch, failed to keep pace with the leaders passing the furlong pole, then was eased by the rider in the final stages, which cost him
any chance for fourth. BARTON HALL shifted from the two path to the four path turning for home, but failed to threaten. MAD GRACE saved ground around
the first turn while far off of the pace, but failed to sustain a four to five wide rally around the far turn, and made no impact. NATIVE LION stalked along the
inside, but was shuffled behind a tiring foe into the far turn, recovered position around that bend, but weakened in upper stretch. TIZ TAKEN BACK trailed
and was never involved. TROPHY DOLL (IRE) dueled for the lead inside of a foe, but weakened turning for home, and stopped. NO CACHA NA (CHI)
dueled for the lead outside of a rival, but weakened into the far turn, and wilted.
