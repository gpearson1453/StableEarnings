Footnotes
BABY SHAMU set a pressured early pace, went four wide into the turn, met the bid of HENNESSY'S SQUIRT in mid stretch, shook clear, opened up and
proved best for the win. HENNESSY'S SQUIRT pressed the early pace, from the inside, was eased back off the pace into the turn, re-rallied along the
inside, made a bid on the winner in mid stretch, couldn't sustain the run and was second best. GUY IN THE SKY stalked the early pace from between rivals,
checked into the turn and was along for the show position. POP QUIZ was taken back early, circled nine wide through the turn and finished with a mild rally.
C D POLDARC was void of any early speed, went five wide into the turn and finished belatedly. SPINNING BLACK outrun early, went seven wide into the
turn and weakened. PULPITS PHANTOM was unhurried early, went five wide into the turn and offered no late rally. FRANKS DEHERE raced in mid pack
early, went six wide into the turn and flattened out. DIXIELAND COWBOY was allowed to settle early from the inside and faded. FLY WITH PRIDE tracked
the early pace, raced between rivals into the turn and tired.
