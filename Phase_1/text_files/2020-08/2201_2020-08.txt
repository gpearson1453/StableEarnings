Footnotes
END ZONE stalked in hand outside the early leader, moved two wide to a short lead approaching the lane, quickly ran clear in early stretch when the rider
dropped his right rein for a few strides then widened under a hand ride. TAPALIST was content to lag inside, swung out leaving the turn and was clearly
second best while no threat to the winner. STARZIP ducked out sharply leaving the gate, raced three wide within striking distance into the turn then stopped
in the lane. UNCLE PAT swung wide into the stretch and outfinished tired ones. CRAZY LEGS HIRSCH broke slowly, was hustled inside early then
stopped. CASCADE KING chased between horses into the turn then stopped in the lane. HECOULDGOALLTHEWAY took over from along the rail before
going a furlong, remained in command inside the winner until nearing the quarter pole and had nothing left for the drive.

Footnotes
BETTER BIZ settled inside, edged out for room nearing the end of the backstretch, was sent closer three wide under whip on the final turn, slowly wore
down AMAZING RIDE through the lane and took over late. AMAZING RIDE was caught four wide into the first turn while rated with the early leaders, moved
two wide to command early on the far turn, drew clear under urging in early stretch but couldn't last. LEMON ROSES made the early pace two wide
between rivals, faded through the final quarter and finished in a dead heat for third. GO TWEET stayed out from the inside while unhurried, improved
position around the final turn, flattened out in the lane and finished even for the show. CAGED BEAR wasn't far back early and was finished after five
furlongs. MOON DATE dueled along the rail for just over a half then stopped. QUEEN OF SHANGHAI went in the air in the gate at the break, stumbled
leaving there and raced far back. KRAZY VIVI stopped and was eased up while never close.

Footnotes
SENOR BLAIR broke slowly, was caught in tight along the rail nearing the end of the backstretch, remained in tight into the turn, responded once clear
approaching the lane, ran clear in early stretch and remained under urging. GHOSTLY WHO was steadied in tight between horses nearing the end of the
backstretch and the turn, edged out into the three path for room entering the stretch, moved closer in midstretch then flattened out. KATS SECOND SILVER
dueled two wide between horses into the stretch then couldn't stay with the top two. FIFTEEN LOVE BACK made a four wide run on the turn to gain a
striking position into the stretch but flattened out. R FAST LIFE was slow early, raced four wide around the turn and outlasted tired ones.
ALLIDOISDREAMOFYOU dueled along the rail into the stretch then stopped. DONTBEFOOLISH was hustled early to be close to the front and was finished
after a half. KANSAS CITY ZIP showed speed three wide for over a half then stopped.

Footnotes
MATROOH was prominent along the rail, moved to a clear lead on the backstretch, widened into the final furlong then held. SEDUCTIVE U S A was
unhurried, rallied the rail into the far turn, angled out for the drive and closed a gap too late. YOUVESAIDITALL trailed into the stretch then made a belated
run between horses. LAWLESS WEST made the early pace two wide outside the winner, continued to chase that one into the far turn then tired. MIDAS
CAT raced the three path and failed to matter. BO TEE bumped with VIEW MAGIC after the break, raced three wide in the second flight and tired. BOSTON
HUMOR faded inside. VIEW MAGIC bumped with BO TEE after the break, raced two wide and tired. VAPORMAN pulled up after a half and was vanned off.
