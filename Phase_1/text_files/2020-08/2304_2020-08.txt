stalked the early pace, went three wide into the turn, angled to the inside and finished second best. OUR LAST ROSE tracked the early pace, went seven
wide into the turn and flattened out. PRINCESS JADA chased the early pace from the inside and tired. LADY BLACK JACK was unhurried early, went four
wide into the turn and finished belatedly. SAMURAI'S GARDEN forced the early pace, was carried out wide into the turn and tired. MOMS FAVORITE was
outrun early, raced between rivals and offered no late rally. IT'S ABOUT ALEX was void of any early speed, went far wide into the turn and never fired.
