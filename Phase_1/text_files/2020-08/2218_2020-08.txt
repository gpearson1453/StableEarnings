Footnotes
PORTABELLA MOON stalked the early pace from the inside, inched forward up the backstretch, responded along the rail entering the drive and drew clear
late. LINE OF FAITH up close early from the outside, inched closer entering the second turn, dueled through the drive but could not match strides. SOCO
UNBRIDLED dueled from the inside early, gained a clear margin up the backstretch, remained forward for the drive but could only hold position. BUGGELS
GIRL outrun early, advanced outside through the second turn, responded but was too late. GRAYZ MIRACLE dueled from the outside early and tired.
PALAIS chased the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, angled outside, drifted seven wide through the drive and was no
threat late. FRESH RISK was no threat. FAST DRAW LADY was steadied early and no factor. REBORN was finished after going a half.

through the second turn, gained a clear margin deep stretch then was all out to last. THE LUMBER GAL chased the early pace from the outside, inched
forward entering the second turn, responded when sat down for the drive but just missed. SEE WHAT'S WHAT well placed from the outside, advanced
through the second turn, responded to pressure but was outfinished for the place. GRACE OF DAVID broke sharp from the inside, gained a clear early
margin, remained clear up the backstretch but had nothing for the drive. KOOL AID GIRL was no factor. TRUE ALLEGIANCE forced the early pace outside
and tired. QUICK POINT was never close. DORA MAAR bobbled at the start, chased the early pace inside and gave way.
