Footnotes
YOUR AWESOME BOSS set a clear pace inside then widened in the stretch while pulling away handily near the middle of the course. TOO MUCH
JOHNNIE steadied after the opening quarter trying to move inside the winner, saved ground and was no match late. MOUNTAIN TREE stalked the winner
outside then drifted out retreating. PROUDMIAMICITIZEN was urged close up to the far turn then gave way readily. JUMP SHOT raced close up wide down
the backstretch and proved empty. GAME CHANGER dropped back early and lost contact with his field. The stewards posted an inquiry into the incident on
the backstretch and the rider of TOO MUCH JOHNNIE claimed foul against the winner for interference after a quarter mile but the result was allowed to
stand.

Footnotes
LIAR SIDE CHAT split foes rounding the first turn and then moved to the rail, lost the lead on the final turn, fought back, gamely through the stretch and got
the nod. BIG RAY, bumped with BIG RAY leaving the gate, was outside early then moved to the rail, angled out through the stretch and just missed. ESOR
stumbled and came in at start, dueled outside, his rider lost his whip near the furlong grounds, ESOR ducked in, then was straightened away and battled
gamely to the wire. JAMA DILLON, who unseated his rider in the post parade, came in at the start bumping POSITIVE IMPACT into PREFONTAINE, was
five path while never far back and lacked a strong closing kick. LT. COLUMBO steadied after the start, raced just off the rail and was no factor. POSITIVE
IMPACT, was bumped leaving the gate then raced very wide. SANTO also unseated his rider and ran off a short distance prestart, saved ground and was
no factor. PREFONTAINE, bumped leaving the gate, showed nothing. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF LT. COLUMBO AGAINST ESOR FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE GATE WAS QUICKLY DISMISSED.

Footnotes
IRISH MEADOW saved ground early, angled out advancing on the turn, split foes in mid-stretch and quickly moved clear. MR. ROUNDTREE severely
bothered at the start, raced in traffic down the backstretch, rallied and led briefly but was outfinished. POLAR BEAR PETE prompted the pace outside, was
carried out at the top of the stretch and finished willingly. OUR STORMIN NORMAN broke slowest, rushed up inside and proved empty in the stretch.
ALFATEI was bumped about badly at the start, dropped far back and was no factor. SPACEMAN chased outside to the stretch and weakened. SON OF
DARKNESS set the pace under a firm rating hold, bore out into the stretch and faded. ATLANTIC CHILL chased within striking range and began faltering on
the turn. FEAR NONE was bumped and placed in tight at the start then trailed throughout. Claims of foul against the first three finishers by the rider of
ALFATEI for interference at the start were dismissed.

edged away then held on. GRIT'N'GRIND was off the rail, tried to split foes near the quarter pole but was forced to angle in to secure racing room and
closed well. BOB'S MY UNCLE, just off the rail while unhurried, angle out into stretch and was steadied slightly racing between rivals near mid stretch when
LATE BREAKING NEWS drifted out. ARMAMENT saved ground while well placed and came up empty. LATE BREAKING NEWS set the pace in three path,
drifted out near mid stretch and faded. GRASSHOPPIN, very wide, failed to menace. DEVINE DENTAL, two wide and just off the pace, had little left. WE B

LITTLE MAZZY stalked the pace three wide, took over after the half, was headed in mid-stretch then came again while drifting out through the final furlong.
ROAN MOUNTAIN settled behind the leaders near the inside, angled out on the turn, led in the stretch but just missed. SPARTAK dropped well behind,
advanced very wide then flattened out late. RATED SPECIAL outrun early inside, bid then was blocked into the far turn and had little further response.
INDIRECTLY ducked out at the break, was urged close up four wide then faded. CITY GUY alternated for the lead under a rating hold then stopped in the
stretch. ANOTHER SMARTY led briefly along the rail then bore out badly while retreating.

Footnotes
YES IT'S ROO saved ground to the final turn, raced and rallied four wide into stretch, was fanned wider and got the nod. IRISH CORK broke right hitting the
side of the gate as the field was dispatched twenty five minutes past scheduled post time, raced outside winner early, angled to the rail entering stretch and
finished well. RISQUE REBEL set the pace in the four path, was clear final turn and stretch, drifted out and weakened. OVER SENSUAL was three wide
and never far back, challenged and weakened. POWERFUL VENEZUELA, between rivals and just off the pace, faded. AWE MUN saved ground and tired.

Footnotes
FORTHELUVOFBOURBON bid strongly to the front midway on the turn, quickly extended his advantage and was geared down through the final furlong.
INTER MIAMI led outside early, bid on the rail turn, was no match for the winner but held on for the place. SIR BACK IN BLACK settled at the back of the
pack, split rivals rallying on the turn and closed well. ROOKIE SALSA hustled wide on the turn then came up empty in the stretch. MR PHIL dropped well
behind and was never in contention. MANOLITO dropped back outside, raced very wide and gave way. ROMANOFF was urged close up inside and steadily
weakened.

THOMAS KNIGHT, racing in the three path chasing, eased out through the stretch, took the lead leaving furlong grounds and drew off driving. FLYING
ROCKET saved ground and was just up for place. SUNRISE SATURDAY, wide, fell back on the turn, came again but had no late kick. DREAMY MARTINI
bobbled leaving the gate and raced very wide. TRUE WISDOM ran as fast and as far as he could then had nothing left. KID MAC COOL, well placed
between foes, tired. MR. ROMANCE broke slowly and showed nothing. ADULATION, outside winner early, stopped.
