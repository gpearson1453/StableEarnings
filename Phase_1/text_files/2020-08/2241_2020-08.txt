half-mile to run, stalked in the two path on the far turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, took the lead while put to a left-handed whip into upper stretch, lost
the advantage to the runner-up briefly at the sixteenth-pole, fought back to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. SNEADS broke out and hit
the gate then bumped with a foe, came in and brushed with another foe shortly thereafter, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, rallied
four wide under urging on the far turn, came under a right-handed whip outside the quarter-pole, gained under a drive into upper stretch, made a bid outside
of the winner while switched to a left-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths, took a narrow and relatively brief advantage at the sixteenth-pole but was
denied while well clear for the place. MINE THE COIN went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn, turned into
the stretch under the whip, pursued the winner into the final furlong and tired while clear for the show. SOUL FIGHT brushed with a foe after the start, raced
inside to the two path on the first turn, was rated off the pace, lost position some while shuffled back a bit behind a stopping THE JOKE'S ON YOU from the
half-mile pole into the far turn, was roused at that juncture, raced inside to the two path through the bend, came under the whip after turning into the stretch
and failed to rally. ICY DUDE was bumped at the start then forced out and taken up while pinched back, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the
rear, was urged along midway down the backstretch, raced inside to the two path early on the far turn, shifted three wide inside the five-sixteenths, came
four wide into the stretch then moved out under a left-handed whip and failed to threaten. MACHO BOY broke out and bumped with a foe then was hustled
to the front, came under restraint while inside on the first turn, set the pace in hand, was let out on the far turn then roused under threat coming to the
five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, dropped back under the whip into the final furlong and gave way. KING OF AMERICAN
was restless in the gate, went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear on the outside, was ridden along while four wide on the far turn, turned
into the stretch under a drive then drifted out around the three-sixteenths and failed to respond. THE JOKE'S ON YOU was fractious in the gate but came
away well, rounded the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back under urging late on the backstretch and faltered then was
eased in the stretch but was jogged across the wire to achieve participation money then was walked off.

MORE GRAYTFUL in with his initial step, made light contact with LUNA'S IN CHARGE, moved up to contest the pace as the widest of three for a brief
period on the backstretch, left the half mile pole engaged with INSIDE INFO in a one on one contest leading by a slim margin, got roused spinning in the
lane, emerged at the eighth pole in possession of its largest advantage, saw ts fellow in-the-money finishes chip away at the deficit beginning a furlong later,
proved best in a tight three-way photo. LUNA'S IN CHARGE displayed no lasting ill effects after brushing with the winner in the shadow of the starting gate,
departed the backstretch from path two, swung out four wide for the drive, closed in willingly in the final sixteenth pole, missed. THREE JOKERS hustled
from the gate, vied from the rail as the innermost of three for a portion of the journey on the backstretch, got eased coming up to the end of the backstretch
then fell back even farther even though the pace hadn't quickened, was set down to strong handing once again, this occurring at the five-sixteenths pole,
went into the lane, was gradually worked into the three path, kicked into his best in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, finished with a flourish belatedly, came
up short. INSIDE INFO momentarily between rivals disputing the pace on the backstretch, cleared over to the rail after THREE JOKERS at the top of the
turn, dueled with the winner thereafter, got called upon approaching the quarter pole, was shaken off, flattened out. THREE OUTLAWS three wide onto the
turn, got sent out four wide exiting it, never made its presence felt.

Footnotes
NONNA MADELINE coaxed from the gate, bumped lightly and leaned on GOLDEN AWARD into the first turn, dueled two to three wide in hand to the
outside of that rival down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and taking a slight advantage near the quarter
pole, spun just off the inside for home and was bumped lightly inside by her main rival before straightening away, dug in under a drive steadily shaking off
the challenge to inch away to the finish kept to task. GOLDEN AWARD coaxed from the gate, established the front and was bumped and leaned on briefly
into the first turn by the aforementioned foe, dueled in hand to the inside of that rival through the bend and down the backstretch, continued to knock heads
through the far turn and came under coaxing near the quarter pole, got headed for command narrowly near the quarter pole and bumped and briefly leaned
on her rival returning the favor that she did into the first turn, dug in under a drive straightened away getting steadily shaken off and was along well clear of
the rest to be second best. BELLERA two to three wide through the first turn, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide
through the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened while along for the show honors. ALWAYS
SHOPPING bobbled at the break, raced just off the inside through the first turn before going four to five paths off the rail down the backstretch, chased four
wide through the far turn under a ride from three furlongs out, continued four wide for home and tired. BOSSY BRIDE lunged at the start getting away last,
saved ground through the first turn before chasing three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung just
off the inside into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
ROSSA VELOCE chased the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead before the
five-sixteenths, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came under a left-handed whip once straightened for the drive, was bumped in the hindquarters by the
runner-up in the process, battled inside that foe under a drive, switched to a right-handed whip at the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging.
SUMMER BREW broke a step slow, moved out while chasing under urging, went four wide on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, came in and
bumped with the winner after turning into the stretch, was put to a right-handed whip while drifting about a bit outside the furlong marker, switched to a
left-handed whip inside that marker, fought outside of the winner to the wire and missed while able to get the place. NO MO' SPENDING showed speed on
the inside of foes then chased the pace, moved out leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, shifted four wide into the stretch under a
drive, remained on her inside lead while pursuing the top two under a right-handed whip into the final furlong, drifted in after being switched to a left-handed
whip outside the sixteenth-pole, moved back out late and finished willingly to safely secure the show. ROSEY'S PEACH was hustled from the start then
urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came under the whip after turning into the stretch and failed to rally. BIG TIME LADY showed good
speed and set the pace, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead to the winner before the five-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and gave
way. MASHNEE GIRL settled off the early pace while carried in some then came under urging a furlong from the start, went two to three wide on the turn,
was hesitantly ridden behind a rival into upper stretch then forced in outside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. MINERVA DOUBLEPLAY settled on
the outside, was roused while four wide on the turn, came under the whip inside the five-sixteenths, drifted in outside the furlong marker and failed to
respond. FASTELLE had her head turned just before the start then was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, raced well back under some urging, went
three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. LIL THIRSTY broke in and was off slow, spotted the front a couple of
lengths, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn and trailed.

Footnotes
CONTROL GROUP rated along prompting the pace from the two path, was still being confidently ridden taking over the advantage as three-quarters was
being completed, kicked away from the others, was settling in at the three-sixteenths pole when called upon for more, began the final furlong leading by his
biggest margin, shifted out a bit late from some stick work but held sway. TWISTED TOM kept watch on the winner from the pocket, swung to the outside
late on the far turn, got driven three wide into the lane, narrowed in en route to procuring the place. DOUPS POINT took up the chase from the two path
during the opening phases, was slightly wider on the second bend, came under the whip by the five-sixteenths marker, fanned out into path five from upper
to midstretch, proved no match. HIT IT ONCE MORE established the top shortly after the field had been released,went onto the inside route at the top of the
clubhouse bend, carved out the pace, attended by CONTROL GROUP out in the two path, gave in when challenged at the three-eighths pole, steadily
backed away down the stretch. PLAYWRIGHT travelled about the first turn towards the two path, pursued the front runners under a hand ride on the
backstretch, was asked for more cutting over to the rail at the half mile pole, tipped back into path two at the head of the stretch, had no response.
DURKIN'S CALL hit the gate after breaking to the outside, brought up the back of the pack, raced three wide until the conclusion of the backstretch, tucked
one path nearer the rail on turn two, got sent out four wide for the drive, failed to fire and wound up trailing throughout.

Footnotes
LOVE ON THE RUN four then three wide in pursuit, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, rallied to take command near the sixteenth pole and
inched clear in the late going to prevail. HEAVENLY SIS chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper
stretch and kicked on belatedly for the place honors. BLACK MAGIC WOMAN coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand from the three path, tucked
inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive safe to the eighth pole but
under growing threat and was collared a sixteenth from home, then weakened in the late stages. HARLEM HEIGHTS broke out a step at the start and was
corrected, chased three wide down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into
upper stretch and was steadied straightened away with no rival directly in front and not in particularly tight quarters inside of SOFT N LOVELY who did come
inwards slightly but not significantly, then got tepidly handled through to the finish and wrapped up inside the final sixteenth. SOFT N LOVELY coaxed from
the gate, chased four paths off the inside early on before tucking to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and weakened. APURATE stumbled at the start, chased four to five wide until tucked three wide through the turn placed to
coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. SUPERBLOODWOLFMOON four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, came under a long drive at the seven-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
INTREPID HEART was rated inside on the first turn, settled down the backstretch, was roused in the two path early on the far turn, shifted four wide
approaching the five-sixteenths then was put to the whip, moved out under a left-handed whip in upper stretch then was switched to a right-handed whip,
rallied on the outside, switched to a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole, closed well to make a bid into the final sixteenth and got up under strong
handling. WINSTON'S CHANCE was taken under a tight hold early, raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, took the
advantage with a half-mile to run, moved clear while three then two wide on the far turn, was put to a left-handed whip while three wide into the stretch,
dueled inside of GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS into the final sixteenth, brushed twice with that opponent and narrowly bested that foe for the place but was
overtaken by the winner. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS was hustled from the start then taken in hand into the first turn, raced three wide under stout restraint on
that bend then was reserved off the pace, advanced five then four wide under urging on the far turn, made a bid under a right-handed whip outside the
quarter-pole, switched to a left-handed whip at the top of the stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up, brushed twice with that foe in the final sixteenth and
just missed the place while well clear for the show. PROMPT went three then two wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, saved ground under urging early
on the far turn, angled four wide coming to the five-sixteenths then five wide shortly thereafter, was driven into upper stretch and failed to threaten. SUPER
DUDE went four wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace on the outside, was asked leaving the backstretch, chased four then three wide on the turn,
dropped back into the stretch and capitulated. DUNPH went to the front, set the pace on the inside, lost the lead with a half-mile to run, dropped back
outside the three-eighths and stopped then was eased in the stretch but walked off. HAN SENSE had the rider take a few peaks downward on the initial
straightaway then was pulled up on the first turn but walked off.

Footnotes
FOXTAIL lightly hand urged establishing the top, cut over to the inside during the early stages of the run around the clubhouse bend, rated kind showing the
way on a loosely-contested lead, fleetingly felt an uptick in pressure as three-quarters was being reeled off, got set down heading for the quarter pole,
scampered away from upper to midstretch, was still well in control when geared down for the final seventy yards. ESPRESSO SHOT bobbled to the right
springing from the starting gate, was checked brushing with KREESIE, got guided over to the rail, steadied at intervals while appearing keen during the
journey on the backstretch, was being urged along cutting the corner into the stretch, proved no match en route for second. TRAIPSING sighted along the
rail heading for the end of the homestretch, got spotted into the two path after FOXTAIL was itself maneuvered onto the inside route, tepidly pressed the
issue, but for a few jumps at the midway point of the far turn, stepped into the lane and readily backed away. KREESIE made light contact with EXPRESSO
SHOT after bobbling at the start, pursued the pace three wide until the end of the second bend, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, had no
response.

Footnotes
HERWAZE broke out a step at the start and was corrected, raced two to three wide through the first turn before chasing two to three wide down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, floated out five wide into upper stretch, took over
the front and drifted out slightly and was corrected under an off sided stick while drawing clear to the finish kept to task. BEYOND BROWN established the
front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide
into upper stretch under threat and yielded the front, then weakened in the stretch while well clear of the rest for the place honors. ADORABLE MAYA two to
three wide through the first turn, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. SOPHIE FATALE hustled from the gate, chased along the inside,
grew detached down the backstretch at the tail of the field, got placed to a protective hold into the far turn and was eased up to jog along to the finish under
her own power well behind the rest, then was walked off.
