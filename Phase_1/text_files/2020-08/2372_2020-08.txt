Footnotes
PHARAOH'S CITY eased back after the start and trailed down the backstretch, bid wide in the stretch, offered a late surge under confident handling to get
up in time. NIKO STRONG set a clear pace off the inside, widened in the stretch but was caught late. INKY DINKY DO forced the pace inside then went
evenly through the stretch. FIFTY urged close up between rivals down the backstretch, moved inside in the stretch. DON'T MAKE IT EASY advanced very
wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. BRIO MAN hustled close up three wide to the stretch then weakened. UNDER THE GRAYDAR dropped
back losing ground and was never in contention. TOMATER GATOR reserved wide just off the leaders and proved empty in the stretch. CHELIOS lacked
speed outside and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT BOUNTY, with renewed interest for her new connections, was bumped leaving the starting gate, raced along the rail early, eased out on the final
turn and split foes into stretch, took the lead, drifted out and won under strong handling. CARAMEL CREAM was also bumped leaving the gate, raced
between rivals early, was left with the rail on the far turn, swung out near stretch and was gaining. CAT GIUMARELLO, outside and just off the pace, angled
in through the drive and closed too late. GALILEO'S AFFAIR, between foes, failed to menace. SILVER EXCESS set the pace inside to near stretch but had
little left. ROSE OF DUBLIN saved ground and tired. DOUBLE THE BET came in leaving the gate bumping MIDNIGHT BOUNTY into CARAMEL CREAM,
raced wide and was outrun.

showed little. CURLIN'S KNIGHT, lapped on winner early, tired badly. SURFER BOY GEORGE just off the rail and just off the pace, stopped.

UNCLE TONY P inside early, angled out the turn, moved very wide into the stretch then edged clear following a long stretch battle. E T'S NIGHT RANGER
prompted the pace outside, led at the quarter pole but could not hold off the winner. SPLITZVILLE dropped back early, rallied inside on the turn and closed
well too late. SAVAGE raced close up inside, angled wide into the stretch, loomed a threat but was outfinished. TOMASCO hustled to the front inside, was
put to the whip on the turn but faded. LOVINISEASY lacked speed outside, made a brief bid into the far turn but was no factor. IMPOSSEBULL trailed early
then passed a fading opponent. ALMOST IRISH chased wide and gave way readily.

left. BEARING SECRETS, outside, failed to menace. CREATIVE PRINCESS saved ground and tired. MIJA BELLA showed little.

in the two path then proved empty in the stretch. KAREN'S GEM raced just off the leaders outside and began fading on the turn. LORDEN'S LOVE hustled

DOCTORSOFMISCHIEF, two wide early, moved out wider into stretch, took the lead leaving sixteenth pole and was all out to hang on. NTH DEGREE
raced widest, rallied outside winner through stretch and just missed. I'M THE TALENT set the early pace just off the rail, moved out entering the stretch and
faded. NIGHTLIFE, two wide, took the lead on the turn and faded late. THE CIRCLE GAME, racing in the four path, tired. MY QUEEN MICHELLE was
between rivals, had only brief speed. FISH TO FRY, very fractious in the gate, was finished early.

Footnotes
INFURIATED quickly took control, widened under urging on the final turn and in the stretch and was taken in hand late. HARPERS FIRST RIDE dropped far
behind, rallied wide closing the gap while no threat. DEAL DRIVEN pursued the winner outside to the stretch then proved empty. RUBY BLEU advanced in
the two path before half a mile then faltered. SEMI EXCITED broke poorly while ducking in, raced well behind and lacked a solid bid. SENIOR
INVESTMENT saved ground in mid-pack and gave way readily. FOREST FIRE chased very wide for half a mile and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
NAP LAJOIE took the lead at once, set the pace in the three path, extended mid stretch and won driving. FINGLAS was very wide early, gradually made his
way to the rail and gained place. SIGHT LINE raced between foes chasing then lacked a strong finish. PRINTER just off the rail and just off the pace, took
up chase but then faded. NOBLE KENT was left with the rail on the backstretch, moved out on the far turn and faded. MARQ ONE raced wide and failed to
menace. HIS ROYAL MAJESTY between rivals early, was left with the rail and failed to menace. METAPHORICAL, three wide prompting the early pace,
tired. REIGNING WARRIOR was very wide and showed little. BANKER'S ISLAND was never a serious threat. WATCH MY DUST was always far back.
GINNER had only brief speed.
