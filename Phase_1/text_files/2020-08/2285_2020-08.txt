was in the three path into the lane and was no match for the winner late in the stretch run. NAUGHTY NELLIE tracked the pace early, was on the inside into
the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. PRINCESS LEA chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane while making a bid but flattened
out late in the stretch. BLUEGRASS BELLE chased the pace early, was in the six path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. MISS EAU DE VIE
was never a threat. POETS PRINCESS was a bit slow from the gate and no factor thereafter. MPEMBA was never a factor. ENDOWMENT stalked the pace
early on, was in the three path into the lane while making a bid but went wrong late in the stretch run and was vanned off after the race.

Footnotes
LUCKY BETTY came in at the start, stalked the pace early on, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch, drove past the leader and cleared
the field in the final stages. HIS GLORY tracked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane, took over and inched clear in the stretch but yielded
late in the drive. WILDLIFE was bothered at the start and trailed the field early on, was in the six path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining in
the late stages. FRENCH EMPIRE chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive.
JULIA'S READY chased the pace early on, swung into the six path entering the lane, made a bid in the stretch, came in near the eighth pole and leveled off
late in the drive. WEXX stalked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane with no late bid in the stretch run. A. P. PRINCESS set the pace early, was off
the rail into the lane and gave way down the lane. BARONESS VONTRAPPE was cut off by JULIA'S READY near the eighth pole, clipped her heels and
lost the rider. The stewards had an inquiry into the stretch run and after review no action was taken into the final order.

Footnotes
EXTRA ATTENTION trailed the field early on, was in the five path into the lane, rallied in the stretch, made a bid four wide near the eighth pole, edged clear
and was geared down in the final stages. IRREPRESSIBLE chased the pace early, made a three wide bid near the quarter pole, was in the four path into
the lane, inched clear in the stretch but was no match for the winner in the final stages. SEA GARDEN was bumped at the start, vied for the lead early on
four wide then continued to vie two wide, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. CHEWY CHEWY GOOD vied for the lead early
on while between horses, was on the inside into the lane and faltered late in the stretch drive. FREE CAUSE improved position. MUNNINGS SOUL was
through after a half. HAPPY TUNE came out at the start, had early speed then folded up. THOMASVILLE had brief speed then retreated.
