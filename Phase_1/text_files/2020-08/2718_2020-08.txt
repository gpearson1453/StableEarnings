Footnotes
TEMPLES MON CHERI broke readily to gain terms with the first flight four wide in the opening sixteenth, pressed the pace three deep racing into the turn,
shifted inwards despite some left handed pressure racing past midstretch crossing into the path of ROSES FOR DOUG but edged forward under firm
handling. PRINCESA DEL SOL sprinted to the lead in the opening stages while angling to the rail, dueled for command along the inside into the turn past
midstretch but proved only second best. ROSES FOR DOUG, urged between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, was caught in
tight quarters leaving midstretch and weakened late. TOP SHELF SARA, off a step slowly, tracked off the second flight along the inside, shifted out racing
into the lane and displayed some late interest. FOR SARAS SAKE, a bit outpaced early, never menaced. SURELY A LEGEND switched out tracking off the
first flight to the turn but faded early. DATA QUICK, held up to track just off the first flight in early stages, gave way racing into the turn.

Footnotes
PRETTI TA KELA broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage outside a rival racing into the bend, was headed nearing upper stretch but
continued with a game effort to turn back a challenge from MIDNIGHT CURRENT in late stages to prevail under steady handling. The latter was bumped
while being forced in sharply at the start, shifted well off the inside collecting her stride, split foes on the turn advancing on the leaders, moved to challenge
three deep racing into upper stretch but proved only second best. RUNAWAY A. TRAIN, urged pressing the pace along the rail into the turn, struck the front
nearing upper stretch but weakened in late stages. DRAKE'S SPIKED ICE broke inwards bumping MIDNIGHT CURRENT soundly at the start, was settled
along the inside, then saved ground to the lane while making an effort to improve position. STEPPIN ON OUT tracked just off the leaders between foes in
early stages but steadily faded into the stretch. DIGGS WON made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide to the turn but dropped out early.

Footnotes
TENSPEED broke readily, was urged to a forward placing along the rail, conceded the lead to stalk a rival's pace while switching out into the backstretch,
was urged to wrest the advantage from between foes racing into the lane and went clear under brisk handling. IRISH MAJOR settled while angling inside
early, continued unhurried to the far turn, switched off the inside racing into upper stretch gathering momentum, then angled six wide in the closing stages
while prevailing for the place honors. TYLER'S TEK, caught four wide in early stages, shifted in to track between rivals, was prompted to advance in tight
quarters racing into upper stretch, then angled to the inside late while prevailing for a share. LOGAN'S HEROE tracked the leaders inside a rival as part of
the second flight to the far turn, shifted out to bid between foes just off the inside entering the lane but had no late kick. SIDE STREET DAVE tracked the
leaders outside a rival in second flight, shifted three wide while being urged to challenge into the lane but proved empty late. TWO CHANCE tracked the
pace in second flight three deep early, shifted in after a half, was prompted to advance between foes but lacked the needed late kick. CAPTIVE KITTEN
tracked off the second flight three wide early, was prompted to gain position between foes racing into the far turn, swung five wide into the lane but made no
impact. RED CORVETTE angled to the inside tracking off the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch, was urged to advance in close quarters inside
foes but proved empty in the closing stages. GREAT SKY, reserved along the inside, saved ground through the far turn, then was steadied repeatedly into
the stretch while failing to make an impression. MY DISCRETION sprinted to the lead while angling over while gaining a clear advantage, set the pace to the
far turn and gave way abruptly into the lane.

Footnotes
ANGELINA'S HEAVEN, forwardly placed, was rated attending a rival's pace racing into the first turn, edged forward to dictate terms after a half, held sway
into the lane and made the balance of the pace under mild urging. MIZZEN AIR was rated stalking just off the pacesetter in early stages, shifted out three
wide nearing the backstretch while continuing under light reserve, was prompted to advance nearing the lane but proved only second best. SHE MIGHT
TELL, caught in close quarters at the start, was settled between foes in the last flight, shifted three wide racing into the lane gained some position late. VIVA
FOREVER hopped at the start, was caught four wide while being prompted to a position tracking the leaders into the backstretch, angled inwards after a half
and faded into the lane. BREAK AT DAWN settled last early, swung four wide racing into the lane but made no impact. BOLD REY sprinted to the lead while
angling to the rail, was headed on the backstretch, pressed the issue inside the eventual winner to the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
ACCORDING TO ASPEN settled between rivals racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail on the far turn, gained momentum racing into upper stretch,
shifted out to the three path bumping TRENDY NEVE nearing the furlong marker but continued with a steady late response to just collar CARRIAGE
approaching the wire under firm handling. The latter tracked just off the leaders three deep in early stages, continued just out of striking distance to the far
turn, was urged to challenge racing into upper stretch, gained the lead between calls late and just missed. TANTIMA broke in bumping LIL' RED DEVIL, was
righted to track the leaders out of striking distance along the inside, shifted out three wide nearing the lane while being prompted to advance, exchanged
some contact with TRENDY NEVER nearing midstretch and was outkicked by the top pair. SOME SAY SO, forwardly placed stalking a rival's pace, moved
to press the issue racing into the far turn, gained a brief lead nearing the stretch but gave out nearing the sixteenth marker. TWO BE ROYAL settled along
the inside, saved ground throughout but lacked a rally. TRENDY NEVE was prompted to a position tracking the leaders along the inside as part of the
second flight, shifted out nearing the lane, was bumped soundly from both sides nearing midstretch and quickly gave way. ROSIE'S FLOWER'S, urged to
the lead along the inside, set the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and gave way. LIL' RED DEVIL, bumped at the start, never gained contention.
SHE B GLAMOROUS dropped back early.

MS KELA TIME broke inwards clipping GOLDEN GOPHER in the opening stages, angled to the rail tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance
through the backstretch, was prompted to bid for command along the rail on the far turn, then wrested the advantage and went clear into the lane under firm
encouragement. CHARMING FURY was rated along the inside tracking off the second flight to the far turn, gained position inside foes into upper stretch,
shifted out entering the lane but couldn't menace the winner. GOLDEN GOPHER, bumped at the start, clipped heels just after the start, was collected to
track off the second flight outside foes, was prompted to advance while being fanned four wide into the lane but lacked the needed final kick. MARLEY BE
GOOD broke slowly, settled near the inside, made some brief progress between foes but had no late bid. RIVER SWAN, urged to a forward placing tracking
just off the leader, made a brief, three wide bid racing into the far turn but came up empty into the lane. PILOTS STAR, bumped, then squeezed between
foes at the start, never gained contention. DROP O' CHOCOLATE, urged to the lead racing to the backstretch while off the rail, set the pace to the far turn
and gave way once headed by the winner.

ASTOUNDING, bumped at the start, angled to the inside taking up a position tracking off the first flight, steadily advanced on the leaders while shifting out
three wide on the far turn, moved to challenge for command nearing upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. SCATTERED CASH angled to
the inside early tracking off the second flight, saved ground through the far turn, angled out four wide racing through the lane and prevailed for the place
honors. EXECUTIVE DECREE, urged three deep between foes pressing the pace into the first turn, dueled for command between foes into the far turn and
gave way racing into upper stretch. BIG SPORT, urged five wide between foes into the first turn, was held up nearing the backstretch to track off the second
flight, was prompted to advance four wide between foes into the far turn, angled five wide entering the lane and continued with an effort to improve position.
MAY WE ALL settled last racing to the backstretch, swung out to the five path nearing upper stretch, then angled back to the inside racing through the lane
while passing some tiring foes. OUTRUN THE POSSE, urged between foes pressing the pace into the first turn, was eased off the pace to track the leaders
along the inside racing to the far turn but lacked a closing response. LIBERTARIAN, urged along the rail pressing the pace inside foes from the outset to the
far turn, gave way nearing the lane. CANDY WOMPUS, urged to join the pace six wide racing into the first turn, continued five wide to the second bend and
steadily faded. BLUE BOMBER, urged four wide between foes pressing the pace to the backstretch, retreated nearing the far turn.

Footnotes
SLEWS HYMN, forwardly placed between rivals stalking the pacesetter to the turn, was urged to advance nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage
leaving the sixteenth marker and went clear under firm encouragement. HONDO LANE was rated just off the first flight in early stages, angled inside near
the half mile marker, saved ground through the bend while gaining on the pacesetter, shifted out three wide entering the lane and prevailed for the place
honors late. PLANE TALK stumbled at the start, was quickly righted, then urged to a clear advantage racing just off the rail, set the pace through the bend,
dueled for command into the stretch and yielded in late stages. JERRYS PRIDENJOY, urged to a forward placing three deep tracking just off the pacesetter
racing to the turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and finished evenly late. CAVE RUN, slow into stride, was settled last to the turn, shifted out
entering the lane and gained some position while making no real impression. ATTAIN SUCCESS tracked the leaders along the inside as part of the second
flight but faded early.

Footnotes
HURRICAIN HUNTER was rated stalking just off the first flight in the opening half, continued under patient handling into the far turn, shifted three wide
nearing upper stretch and came under stout pressure in the closing stages to wrest the advantage nearing the wire. FLASH FLOOD gained a forward
placing three deep racing just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, pressed the issue in that path into the far turn, gained the advantage nearing upper
stretch, resisted the winner's challenge to late stages but came up second best. MZ JACKIE was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, angled four wide entering the lane and made an effort to improve position. BOOZIN AT BOZOS switched outside the leader early while moving
to terms with that foe attending the pace, prompted the issue between foes, then along the inside on the fa turn and gave way nearing the lane. LEFT OF
CENTER settled along the inside early but never gained contention. ADDED DIAMONDS, urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the
backstretch, dueled for command into the far turn and gave way.
