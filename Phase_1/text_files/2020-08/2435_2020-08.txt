NIIGON'S GLORY gained the lead on the first turn, held well into the stretch, responded and was driven clear. PREACHER TIME led early, was forwardly
placed along the inside after being headed on the first turn and lacked room in the stretch. BIG HEARTED FACTOR chased while three wide and lacked a
rally. BAGPIPES urged along early, settled, lodged a bid on the far turn and flattened out. CANDY MY BOY took no part. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE
RIDER OF PREACHER TIME FILED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF NIIGON'S GLORY CLAIMING FOUL. AFTER REVIEWING
VIDEOTAPED REPLAYS, THE STEWARDS DISMISSED THE OBJECTION AND MADE NO CHANGES.
