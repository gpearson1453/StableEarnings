speed and had a mild gain from the inside on the turn but from the four path through the stretch was no match for the winner. R DANCE HALL settled off the
pace, trailed the field on the turn and was up for show. UNCLE LOU was unhurried early and a factor on the turn but from the six path at the top of the
stretch leveled off. TALE OF RONIN stalked the early leader but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

and was a factor on the far turn but with the lead from the five path at the top of the stretch was caught late. OUR PETUNIA set the pace and had the lead
on the far turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. NARROW ESCAPE was in touch and hustled along on the far turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. GIANT MINE was unhurried early, chased on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch failed
to fire. DECISION DAY had no speed and saved ground on the far turn but was never in contention.

Footnotes
CENAR stalked the leader, had a slim lead on the far turn and fought gamely through the stretch and just lasted. DIVINE AMI was in range and had a mild
gain on the far turn but from the four path through the stretch just missed. MARRIAGE COUNSELOR showed speed from the outside, was headed on the
far turn and vied through the stretch but was outgunned. CORDERO (IRE) was off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and angled out through the stretch
but needed more. I IDOLIZE YOU was in touch but chased on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off.
CHIEFROLL'NTHUNDER had no speed, showed little and was not a factor. TH ORIGINAL SCOTTY was well back, trailed the field on the far turn, pulled up
in mid stretch and walked off.

TOBRUK tracked the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and from the six path through the stretch drew clear. BE THE CHANGE was unhurried early
and moved up on the turn but with the lead from the five path in mid stretch was outfinished. SUMMER RETREAT forced the early pace and had a slim lead
on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. BAKERSFIELD set a pressured pace and dueled from the inside on the turn but
dropped back though the stretch.

a factor on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was second best. SILENT CHARITY stalked the leader and had the lead on the far
turn but failed to hold. ONE FOR NICKI was off the pace, had a mild gain on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was the best of the
rest. RASPBERRY WILD had no speed and saved ground on the far turn but was no real threat. MYSTERY DAY was in range and raced evenly on the far
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. MOON ROVER showed speed and set the pace but was headed on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
JACK BEANSTALK set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn and was kept to task through the stretch. SHANGASSAH was well back, closed the
gap on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for place. SILENCIUM forced the pace, dueled on the turn and from the three path
at the top of the stretch held show. THOR'S THUNDER was in mid pack and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed
more. AWESOME MINER was in range and had a good position on the turn but had no late kick. FAHRENHEIT was in touch and roused on the turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch flattened out. FOREHEAD FRED was off slow and showed little while outrun. DEPUTY OF EGBERT was up
close early but lost ground on the turn and had no impact. CHESTERMERE was off the pace, showed nothing and was never in contention.
