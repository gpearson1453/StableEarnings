Footnotes
AMPERSAND bobbled at the break and traded a bump with EXPLAIN when recovering inwards as that rival recovered outwards from a stumble, crossed
directly to the inside and saved ground in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, rallied
having the leader FOLIAGE come inwards near the three-sixteenths to tighten up the seam on the rail, scraped the paint to the inside of that rival not the
least bit intimidated getting leaned on before trading leans near the eighth pole just before seizing command inside that station, then inched clear to the
finish to prevail. FOLIAGE coaxed from the gate, showed the way lightly coaxed along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through
the turn under pressure from EXPLAIN to the outside, got let out spinning just off the inside for home, shook off her main prompter confronted to the inside
by the aforementioned foe, came in under a near side rein and off side stick to tighten up the seam inside and leaned on her main danger before trading
leans clinging to the lead a furlong out, got headed inside that station and fought on to the finish being shaken off in the late stages while clear of the rest to
be along second best. EXPLAIN stumbled at the start recovering outwards and bumped with AMPERSAND who recovered inwards from a bobble and
conceded only a length to the front placed to coaxing, prompted the leader from the outside two then three wide coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from
home, swung three wide into upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away and weakened while along clear for the show honors. HONORABLE brushed
the off side stall at the start, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing three furlongs out, angled five wide at the head of the stretch and weakened.
CONGRATS FOR GLORY coaxed from the start, chased three then four wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper
stretch, tired, and was not persevered with through the final eighth to the finish.

Footnotes
MACHO JACK bumped with a rival at the start, chased the pace from second, raced in the three path on the turn, floated four wide into the stretch, was put
to a right-handed whip at the three-sixteenths then switched to a left-handed whip in pursuit of the pacesetter outside the furlong marker, gained to make a
bid nearing the sixteenth-pole and got up under good handling. OH MY PAPA was hustled to the lead, showed the way through quick fractions, raced inside
on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, came under a right-handed whip at the top of the stretch, led into the final sixteenth, switched to a left-handed
whip after being headed about seventy yards from the wire and was outfinished but clearly earned the place. AIRTOUCH bumped with a rival at the start
then brushed with another foe, bumped lightly with BEACH FRONT early, was ridden along off the pace, rounded the turn in the five path, turned into the
stretch under a right-handed whip, was switched to a left-handed whip while still on his inside lead inside the eighth-pole, continued on his inside lead in the
final furlong and lacked the needed kick but was clear for the show. BEACH FRONT broke in and bumped with a rival, bumped lightly with two foes early,
was urged along off the pace, dropped from the four path to the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to rally. OUR
AMERICAN STAR was unsettled in the gate then had an extra assistant starter provide help to straighten him just prior to the start, bumped lightly with an
opponent early, was ridden along at the rear on the outside, angled in with a half-mile to run, saved ground on the turn, came three wide into the stretch,
moved out in the drive and failed to threaten. KILMARKNOCK bumped with a rival at the start then brushed with another foe, was urged along in third
position, traveled around the turn in the four path, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to respond.

FAST GETAWAY made contact with MONTAUK DADDY after stumbling at the break, assumed the advantage, set the splits taking the two path, pressed by
a pair of opponents to his outside and while pulling on the left, slid over to the inside route in time for the run around the bend, settled onto the head of the
stretch and was set down, began the last eighth leading by his largest margin, saw its fellow-in-the-money finishers narrow the gap from the sixteenth pole
onward, came out late but managed to hold sway. JAKE ROCKS away to a clean getaway, cut over towards the inside, was the widest of three vying for
control, four wide on the backstretch and then from the three path after entering the turn, saw the winner edge away prior to spinning into the stretch, tagged
up with AMERICAN MANDATE staging a comeback in the last sixteenth, fell short. AMERICAN MANDATE narrowly avoided becoming a participant in a
bumping incident in the shadow of the starting gate, forced the issue three wide early and then later on from path two during the run around the bend, all the
while in between the top twosome, got driven into the stretch, closed in on the top one in a steadfast manner leaving the sixteenth pole, had to settle for the
show. MONTAUK DADDY ping-ponged between its next stall neighbors right after the start, got set up along the inside route, stayed there until the end of
the bend, got roused stepping into the stretch, made no impact during the drive, pulling left. CRYOGENIC bumped twice shortly after the field had been
released, worked out a tuck into the two path coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, fanned out into path four wide from upper to midlane, had no
response.

SUPER DUDE just off the inside through the opening bend, took over command at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under growing and flanking threat from a trio through the final furlong and lasted to the finish being shown the
stick to the off side in the final jumps. CHIEF KNOW IT ALL broke a half a beat slow after lightly tossing his head at the break, tracked the pace along the
inside, tipped to the two path to move around the backing away MAJID three furlongs from home placed to coaxing, swung two to three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive latching on the leader through the final sixteenth to his inside and could not go by getting repelled to the wire. HEAVY ROLLER
three wide through the first turn, chased four wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between
foes and stayed on one paced to the finish unable to go past the leader to the line. HAMMERIN AAMER just off the inside through the first turn, chased
three wide down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the far turn placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cornered three to four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on in the late stages through to the finish but was ultimately rebuffed at the end. MAJID hustled from the gate,
established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside through the first turn before briefly taking to the two path into the backstretch, tucked
inside six furlongs from home, got lightly coaxed along into the far turn before yielding the front readily at the seven-sixteenths, retreated through the far turn
to the tail of the field while placed back in hand, took the inside route into upper stretch and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
NAUTILUS bobbled slightly at the start then was hustled, contested the pace on the outside of a foe under constant urging, vied in the two path on the turn,
turn, came under a right-handed whip at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch between horses, fought gamely under a continued right-handed whip in
the drive, battled with two foes into the final sixteenth then dueled with the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. LIKEABLE
angled out sharply leaving the chute, chased the pace on the outside, advanced four then three wide to make a bid on the turn, turned into the stretch under
the whip, bumped lightly with REPO ROCKS nearing the furlong marker, bumped again with that foe outside the sixteenth-pole, dueled with the winner in
the final sixteenth and just missed while able to get the place. REPO ROCKS bumped lightly with a rival at the start, tracked the pace down the backstretch,
went four wide early on the turn then dropped to the three path, was given his cue outside the five-sixteenths, advanced four wide to make an outside bid in
upper stretch, bumped lightly with LIKEABLE nearing the furlong marker, bumped again with that foe near the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while well
clear for the show. EXCURSION broke a bit slow and spotted the front a couple of lengths, was urged along at the rear, raced in the two path for most of the
turn, dropped to the rail inside the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to threaten. THORN settled on the inside, saved ground
early on the turn, moved to the two path while roused around the five-sixteenths then shifted three wide shortly thereafter, raced just behind the leading
quartet into the stretch, moved out outside the furlong marker and came up empty. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN bobbled at the start but recovered quickly,
disputed the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under a strong hand ride, dropped back in upper
stretch and capitulated. MO MISCHIEF bumped lightly with a rival at the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back while three wide on the
turn and retreated.

CENTRAL EXIT prompted the pace from the two path, challenged in earnest spinning into the stretch, struck the front deep in the furlong grounds then
shook free.. SHENANDOAH RIVER taken hold of after coming in springing from the gate, chased the pace from the two path on the turn, swung out
approximately five wide into the lane, saw the pilot apply strong pressure on the right side countering an inclination for the mount to lug in, did indeed do so
when the whip was sparingly used from the same side, rallied for the place. LOVE ME TOMORROW retained the lead after breaking on top, cut over to the
inside, showed the way, tailed by the winner from the outside, was put to the test by CENTRAL EXIT as the twosome made their way onto the head of the
stretch, relinquished soon afterwards, weakened late into the show slot. FLATTERING EYES took the inside route, got set down in the general area of the
five-sixteenths pole, stepped into the stretch, had no closing punch. HAPPY HILL LIL saved ground for nearly a half, lacked a response after being spotted
into the two path at the top of the lane. VINITA four wide onto the turn, was slightly closer to the rail exiting it, never got involved. OAK CREEK CANYON
checked shying away from an incoming SHENANDOAH RIVER in shadow of the starting gate, rode the rail for the opening half, got sent out four wide from
upper to midstretch, never made her presence felt. SMOKIN HOT KISS raced towards the inside until the end of the bend, tipped out two wide for the drive
to no avail.

KINGMEISTER two to three wide in pursuit, swung three wide into upper stretch and took over command straightened away, got roused at the eighth pole,
continued to draw clear under a hand drive and was geared down in the late stages. PLOT THE DOTS chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home, proved no match for the top one while keeping on clear of the rest to be along second best. CHASE
TRACKER showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front
straightened away and weakened. ARITHMETIC off to an awkward beginning, chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off

Footnotes
SEA FOAM showed early speed, contested the pace in the three path on the first turn, moved clear early on the backstretch, showed the way through quick
fractions, was asked while inside to the two path on the far turn, came under a right-handed whip once straightened for the drive, extended the advantage
into the final furlong, remained clear under a drive into the final sixteenth and lasted under strong urging. LEGIT dropped well behind early, saved ground on
the first turn, lagged at the rear, moved out of last under urging at the nine-sixteenths, was hard ridden on the final turn, angled out four wide late on that
bend, gained under the whip into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, drifted in while closing well at the sixteenth-pole and finished with good
energy but was too late while clear for the place. GROWTH ENGINE broke out then was quickly corrected by the rider, saved ground on the first turn,
settled in fourth position, was asked near the seven-sixteenths, chased inside on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, dropped back under a
drive into the final furlong and weakened while able to get the show. WINSTON'S CHANCE went three wide on the first turn, was carried out some near the
three-quarter pole, settled on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn, was put to the whip inside the five-sixteenths, pursued the winner into upper
stretch and tired. BLEWITT was hustled from the start, disputed the pace while inside on the first turn, dropped back early on the backstretch then moved
out, tracked the winner under urging from that point, came up empty on the far turn and retreated. NOBLE THOUGHT broke a step slow then was in a touch
tight briefly, moved out under urging early, went four wide on the first turn, floated well wide on the backstretch, dropped to the rear at the nine-sixteenths
then fell well behind and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
HALLADAY assumed the advantage shortly after the field had been sent on its way, glided over towards the inside route, was coaxed along showing the
way on a loosely-contested lead, ventured onward under the same scenario for three-quarters, got set down to a drive in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths
pole, began the final furlong with GET STORMY bearing down hard to his outside, dug in gamely to fend off the strong challenger. GOT STORMY tracked
HALLADAY while well rated in the pocket, was still being snug held as the third fraction was being finalized, got cued up tipping to the outside at the
three-sixteenths pole, inched up towards the one to catch, took aim, finished willingly but got staved off by an opponent equal to the task at hand. CASA
CREED took the inside route for the opening six furlongs, angled three wide for the drive home, rallied for the show. EMMAUS (IRE) procured a prominent
position, entered the clubhouse turn three wide, scooted past another and worked out a tuck into path two a few strides later, was patiently ridden stalking
the top one, kept up until the head of the stretch before weakening. RAGING BULL (FR) rode the hedge during the initial stages, got eased to the outside
travelling on the backstretch, departed it from path two, required some hand encouragement to keep pace during the run around the far turn, fanned out into
path five from upper to midstretch, lacked the needed response. WITHOUT PAROLE (GB) reserved travelling from path two in midpack, swung out four
wide for the drive, had no closing punch.. UNI (GB) underwent a two wide pursuit, was sighted under a hand ride on turn two, got sent out into path six for
optimal clearance in the stretch, made no impact. VALID POINT worked out a tuck into the two path shortly after leaving the homestretch, kept an eye on
the top one from there for six furlongs, shifted inward after stepping into the stretch, backed away steadily afterwards. CHEWING GUM quickly spotted
along the hedge after hitting the right side of the gate, went on to save ground to no avail.

Footnotes
LETTERMAN grew rank along the inside under restraint into and through the majority of the first turn before settling to track along the inside down the
backstretch, remained patiently handled through the far turn until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive rallying to take command a sixteenth from home, inched away briefly, came under late threat and dug in to prevail. BATTALION broke a beat slow
brushing the near side stall and came under an off sided stick and hustling when conceding three to four lengths to the front, saved ground at the tail of the
field through through the opening bend and down the backstretch, tipped to the two path through the far turn and bobbled just outside the three-eighths
pole, got put to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch, shied out under a near sided stick straightened away before
being corrected and offered up a good finish to close in stoutly in the late stages latching on the winner as that rival hit the wire. KID CHOCOLATE saved
ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and closed well to secure the show
honors. SCOTTY BROWN a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, got away well and established the front shortly after the break to show the way in hand
along the inside, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole when under pressure for the initial time, cut the corner roused
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive staving off challenges in front until collared a sixteenth from home, then got outfinished in the late stages.
KILRONAN two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up
a bid to the eighth pole, couldn't sustain the move inside that station and flattened out in the late going. CATORAT grew rank under restraint early on into
the first turn just off the inside, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and offered
no response. HOLD MY CALL forwardly placed just off the inside, tracked the leader in closest aim, began an advance on that rival through the far turn
coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole before being set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages.
REVENIO broke in at the start and was corrected before contact could be made with SCOTTY BROWN, raced three wide through the first turn before
chasing three then four wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and tired.
