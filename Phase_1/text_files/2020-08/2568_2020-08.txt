Footnotes
KELA'S TURN carried in at the start, recovered to set the pace and kicked clear in the stretch. SWEET WALKIN' SUGA veered in at the start, chased along
the inside and kept on willingly. CYNDIES CHARM ducked in at the start, was settled while three wide and rallied while four wide in the stretch. SASSY
AIN'T I failed to threaten. GARBO SPEAKS chased while three wide and lacked a rally. SASS N STYLE was void of speed. READY TO GET LOUD stalked
the pace and weakened. ATLANTIS ALANA was always outrun.

POPULAR KID stalked the early pace, dueled on the far turn,, responded to brisk pressure and wore down his chief rival. PINSON grabbed the lead, was
challenged on the far turn, dug in gamely yet missed. BOW AND ARROW saved ground, moved closer in the far turn and stayed on. HOUR CITY never
menaced. DAVIDIC LINE raced forwardly while four wide and faded. COAL TRUTH leapt in the air at the start and proved no factor. ALWAYS A CATCH
was always outrun.

position while three wide, advanced on the turn and stayed on gamely in the stretch. HULEN saved ground, was angled off the rail for the stretch run and
managed a mild rally. SEBASTIAN'S BOY raced forwardly placed along the inside and lacked a rally. GREEDY CREEDY dwelt at the start, advanced on
the turn, went four wide into the stretch and came up empty. EDGE TO EDGE bumped at the start, chased the pacesetter and weakened. STAGE DOOR

Footnotes
STUART HALL reserved early, commenced his bid on the far turn, was swung six wide and rallied. APALACHEE BAY grabbed the early lead, held well into
the stretch and was reeled in late. ONE STOP SHOP saved ground and displayed some mild late interest. TOUCH 'EM UP passed tired ones. BUSTER
BROWN BOY was outpaced while five wide and made no impact. MONDAY CONFESSION chased while three wide and weakened. HOLIDAY MAN
stalked the early pace and retreated.
