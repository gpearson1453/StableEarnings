Footnotes
CHAINMAIL tracked HOLLEE PEACH between horses early, inched up past the three quarter to press outside that leader, was pushed along into the turn to
vie outside that foe around the bend and into the lane, and drove clear past the furlong mark. TANNAH'BLU settled near the rear of the compact field in the
mile chute, raced two wide along the backstretch after KINGSBURY DREAM settled back, was pushed along two wide into the turn, improved in the three
path, loomed three wide approaching the quarter pole, continued to give chase down the lane but was no match for the winner. HOLLEE PEACH soon led,
took pressure from CHAINMAIL to her outside past the three quarters, vied inside that foe around the turn and under a drive into the lane, proved no match
for her past the eighth pole, flattened and could not hold place. KINGSBURY DREAM bobbled in the opening strides but nonetheless tracked the leader
inside down the chute, veered in where the chute met the clubhouse turn but was soon righted by her jockey, settled midfield inside of TANNAH'BLU down
the backstretch, chased while saving ground through the turn, came into the lane in the two path and chased on evenly the rest of the way. ENCHILADA
settled at the rear, was pushed along in the three path on the turn, swung out to the seven path into the lane, took closer order late but ultimately never
threatened. PAULETTE attended the pace three wide for the first half mile, weakened three wide around the turn and was empty in the drive.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE stalked the frontrunner between horses up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, improved position on the
outside down the stretch and pushed to a narrow advantage in the final strides. SUPERMANS CAPE chased the leader on the outside in the early going,
ran in the two path around the turn, moved up to challenge approaching the quarter pole and dueled gamely in the final furlong, but just missed.
IWILLPERSEVERE dropped off the pace in the opening quarter, began to move up on the field passing the three eighths pole, entered the stretch from the
two path and gained ground late. HERE COMES KYLE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two
path, entered the stretch in tight quarters, was blocked again near the eighth pole, bobbled slightly at the sixteenth pole and made a mild gain of ground
from there to the wire. STORMIN EL PRADO bobbled leaving the gate, chased the leader between horses, angled in to save ground around the turn and
finished evenly on the rail. DARK NINJA hopped up leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn,
continued to show the way into the stretch and tired in the final furlong while drifting out slightly. BANK MAN dwelt at the gate, lost six to eight lengths before
he ever got rolling, trailed far behind the field the entire way around the oval and was never a factor. THE HALF MILE TIME AS BEEN OMITTED FROM
THIS CHART DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION. Missing time determined following video review.

Footnotes
GRANDAL broke outward and bumped COCO BRAVADO in the opening strides, was hustled to the lead, set the pace while saving ground through the turn,
was confronted by the tracking flight near the quarter pole, kicked clear into the lane, and found enough under a drive to hold off GRANDMAS FAVORITE in
the final stages. GRANDMAS FAVORITE chased inside of CHARLIECANDO, swung five wide into the lane for a bid, strongly rallied four wide through
midstretch, gained on GRANDAL all the way to the wire but narrowly missed. CHARLIECANDO chased two wide early and in the five path on the turn,
swung six wide into the lane, and ran on outside best of the rest while never threatening the leading pair. LAND MARK DEAL tracked the leading pair inside
of RULE FOLLOWER early, saved ground in range around the turn, chased the leader while driven in upper stretch, but found himself outfinished. RULE
FOLLOWER tracked the leading pair two wide early, pulled into the bend, was taken three wide for a bid on the turn, proved no match four wide into the
lane, and weakened. SUSPIROS settled in second last, was urged while saving ground through the turn, came into the lane under a drive inside, and
passed tiring horses. COCO BRAVADO was bumped by GRANDAL in the opening strides, was sent for pace but outsprinted by that foe, tracked between
horses around the turn, confronted the pacesetter near the quarter mile mark, proved no match for GRANDAL into the stretch, and weakened in the final
furlong. SPECIAL PRYCE was slow into stride inside, trailed in the three to four path on the turn, came under a drive into the lane, and offered no rally.

Footnotes
RIV raced on the inside in the middle of the pack early, navigated the turn from the two path, began his bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and gradually
wore down his rival through the stretch to get up for the win. GORGEOUS GEORGE raced off the pace between horses early, came around the turn in the
two path, angled out at the top of the stretch to find racing room and gained ground steadily on the outside to the wire. DO NOT ENTER led the field up the
backstretch, extended his lead from the two path around the turn, raced gamely down the stretch and was caught in the final sixteenth. SHANGHAI POINT
chased the leader on the inside, saved ground around the turn and raced evenly in the stretch to the wire. NYOMAN trailed the field on the inside through
the opening three eighths of a mile, saved ground around the turn, and improved position in the stretch. CHRISTMAS COOKIE bumped with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, entered the stretch from the four path and made a mild improvement from
there. I AM TOO WILD chased the leader on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three path and faded in the final furlong. LEE'S
LUCK stumbled slightly leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and
made no bid in the stretch.

Footnotes
LAVERNS LASS hopped slightly in the opening strides, stalked the pace through the first turn, overtook TALK NICE on the lead past the eleven sixteenths,
continued on the pace while prompted by BE AUTHENTIC down the backstretch and through the far turn, came into the lane under a drive inside, continued
gamely despite drifting out and making some brushing contact with BE AUTHENTIC, and repelled that foe all the way to the wire. BE AUTHENTIC tracked
the leading pair through the first turn, attended the pace outside of LAVERNS LASS down the backstretch and through the far turn, vied outside of her in the
lane, made brushing contact with that foe down the lane, fought doggedly but could not get past. HOOK HER UP chased midfield inside foes through the far
turn and into the backstretch, raced between horses past the half mile to get around the weakening TALK NICE, tracked the leading pair in the two path on
the turn, was taken out for a rally outside them in midstretch, gained but could not quite reel them in. BROADWAY DUCHESS settled two wide toward the
rear of the main pack, proved hard to handle through the first turn, dropped inside of BELLA LINDA on the backstretch, continued to chase in the three path
on the far turn, rallied three wide into the lane, sustained her bid five wide into the final furlong and continued to gain to the wire. BELLA LINDA settled at the
rear of the main pack inside BROADWAY DUCHESS through the first turn, raced outside of her down the backstretch, was pushed along in the three path
on the far turn and urged two wide into the lane, but could not reel in the leaders and weakened in the final sixteenth. TALK NICE was hustled for early
pace, made the running through the first turn until being headed by LAVERNS LASS near the eleven sixteenths, tracked the leaders inside down the
backstretch, saved ground through the far turn while gradually losing ground on the leaders, and continued to flatten out inside down the lane. EASY EYES
was reluctant to load, settled at the rear through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, joined outside of VICTORY ROSE in the rear pair through the
far turn, but lacked the needed rally in the lane. VICTORY ROSE always raced toward the rear, saved ground through the far turn and into the lane, and
offered no bid. LOGI raced midfield in the five path on the first turn, chased two wide down the backstretch, was pushed along three wide into the far turn,
but weakened three wide around the bend and had no more down the lane.

Footnotes
FOLLOW THE SIGNS was away quickly outside of WARRIORS GEM and ENZOEXPRESS but settled back to track that pair, bid three wide into the turn,
loomed outside the leading pair from the three eighths, came into the lane three wide under a drive, kept on tenaciously under a drive outside of
WARRIORS GEM, wrested the lead inside the sixteenth pole and edged away. WARRIORS GEM disputed the early pace inside of ENZOEXPRESS, shook
clear approaching the half mile marker, was reengaged by that foe to his outside on the turn and disputed the pace again past the three eighths, came into
the lane with a narrow lead over the looming FOLLOW THE SIGNS, went to a drive approaching the furlong pole, kept on gamely but could not hold the
winner off past the sixteenth pole. TETSU chased outside of EASTER MUSIC down the backstretch and through the turn, was urged along behind
WARRIORS GEM into the lane, could not match the leading pair under a drive but kept on a clear best of the rest. ANDREAS raced at the inside of the rear
pair early, trailed into the turn but was pushed along in the three to four path to regain touch outside of Z U SOON, dropped to the inside in upper stretch,
and offered a mild rally under a drive. DEANO grazed the gate and broke inward, settled near the rear early, chased in the two path on the turn, was taken
outside into the lane and put to a drive, and kept on mildly outside foes. Z U SOON came away near the leaders but gradually and continuously lost position
down the backstretch and into the turn, saved ground around the turn toward the rear of the field, and offered mild late interest between horses in the final
furlong. TORNADO BOY raced at the outside of the rear pair early, continued near the rear in the five path on the turn, came three wide into the lane, and
lacked the needed rally. EASTER MUSIC chased inside of TETSU, saved ground through the turn, and flattened out from the quarter pole. ENZOEXPRESS
disputed the pace outside of WARRIORS GEM in the opening furlong, let that foe edge clear approaching the half mile pole, was pushed along to reengage
outside of that same foe past the three eighths, disputed the pace to the half mile pole, but emptied out between horses into the lane.

Footnotes
JEGGYJEGGY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, dug in passing the eighth pole and
gained ground quickly in late stretch to just get up for the win. GREY MASK tracked the leader on the outside early, angled out to find racing room headed
into the turn, launched a bid three wide approaching the quarter pole, took the lead with a furlong to go and raced gamely to the wire, getting caught in the
final stride and just missing the head bob. V MAN raced between horses in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn
from the two path, angled out in upper stretch to find racing room and gained ground in the final furlong. J Z'S LAST TRY raced at the back of the pack on
the outside in the opening stages, came around the turn in the three path and improved position on the outside in the final sixteenth of a mile. HIGH HERO
chased the frontrunner on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, moved up to challenge the leader near the quarter pole, was
in tight quarters entering the stretch, found racing room and then weakened in the final furlong. MAXIMIZER raced between horses at the back of the pack
early, came around the turn in the two path and offered no bid. TIO CHUY led the field up the backstretch and around the turn, saved ground the entire way
around the oval and tired in the final furlong. STRIKING HEIR raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and came up empty in the stretch.
