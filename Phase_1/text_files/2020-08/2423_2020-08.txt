dropped back on the far turn, came again on the inside in the stretch and finished well. DON'T FIGHT was allowed to settle, rallied in the stretch and closed
willing. PRIDE LEADER raced mid pack and went evenly late. PAZ THE WINE prompted the pace until mid stretch and faltered late. HELEN HAYES raced
close up for three quarters, then gave way. ALIN AZUL set the early pace and weakened on the far turn. PURPLE GIRL contended for three quarters, then
dropped back. CHA CHA HEELS had no speed and was eased down the backside and was vanned off.
