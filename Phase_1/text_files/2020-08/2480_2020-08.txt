Footnotes
GO FOR SHERRIE rated on the front end toward the outside, was two wide taking the bend, roused at the top of the lane and shook free inside the last
furlong. YABA DABA DOO prominent from inside, was boxed in upper stretch, got through three wide inside the final eighth and closed the gap late on the
leader as he took over second in the waning yards. INTERNET SUCCESS vied for the lead from inside and gradually wore down inside the last furlong.
SERIOUS TALK pressed from outside, jostled with G G'S SECONDCHANCE from the half mile marker to the seven-sixteenths pole when the latter was
trying to gain a clear path on the backstretch, was three wide through the turn and gradually wore down for the drive. G G'S SECONDCHANCE found
himself boxed in midway on the backstretch, altered out a bit and jostled with SERIOUS TALK to just into the bend, dropped back, moved to the outside,
drifted out entering the lane and upper stretch and had no late bid.

JAM UP rated on the front end between rivals, moved clear when allowed on the turn, was put to a drive midstretch, kept to task to the sixteenth marker and
proved much the best. EQUALLY EVEN settled on the backstretch, began to close the gap along the rail on the bend and took over second inside the final
furlong. WHITE CASHEL never far back, advanced from outside, lost ground four then five wide taking the turn and gained third late. MEETMEINSTLOUIE
displayed early speed from inside, did not stay with JAM UP on the turn, angled outside that one leaving the bend and began to wear down between rivals
the last eighth. SWIFTY CAUSE void of speed from inside, was steadied when her path narrowed into the turn, angled outside, was widest through the bend
and passed tired ones deep stretch. SOUTHERN ATTACK in contention from the early going, was two to four wide through the bend and flattened out for
the drive. COUNTRY JO dwelt then bobbled from the gate and showed little. INNER DELIGHT pressed the early speed from outside but began to tire three
wide before finishing a half mile. PHOENIX ATTACK chased staying off the inside and was empty for the stretch run.

TALES OF WAR in reserve the first half mile, picked up his pace after that, closed the gap under a drive from just off the inside through the second turn,
angled out four wide upper stretch, was all out and got up in the final strides. JOEY B kept close from inside, went for the lead three wide on the second
turn, battled to hold on through the stretch and was narrowly outfinished in a game effort. TOCCETIVE JAC also settled well off the early pace the first half
mile, commenced his bid from inside entering the second bend, floated out some into the lane, altered in for a clear path upper stretch, dueled for the lead
the final furlong, was narrowly outfinished as well but clearly best of the others. GARRISON COMMANDER displayed early speed just off the rail, did not
keep up on the backstretch, was two wide on the second turn, fanned out some entering the lane, altered inside JOEY B upper stretch and flattened out
from between rivals inside the last furlong. DAVKA was prominent early but faded from outside with a half mile to go. JOLLY GHAALY advanced outside
horses to gain the lead on the backstretch, moved to the rail nearing the second bend then gave way with two furlongs left.

Footnotes
GREAT SCAT threw his head up when the gate opened then bobbled leaving his post, advanced without urging from inside to share the lead, moved clear
when asked leaving the turn then gradually opened up through the lane. MUSIAL prominent from outside, angled in on the bend and caught the weakening
PEACOCK MAN for second in the waning yards. PEACOCK MAN displayed early speed from off the rail, was soon challenged from inside, floated out some
entering the stretch and slowly wore down in the late going. STEALIN' SUMMER caught in tight between horses on the backstretch, advanced from inside
on the turn, came off the rail a bit for the stretch run and failed to have a significant response. K STREET broke well but soon dropped back, stayed off the
inside and failed to menace. COUNTRY COOL raced in contention on the backstretch but gave way three wide on the bend. CARTIAC ROAD steadily
faded in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
SHEZAHOTMAMA bumped with COUNTRY ASSETS at the start, advanced from outside to vie for the lead three wide on the turn, retreated some upper
stretch, came again to duel for the lead the final sixteenth and edged ahead in time. DARLIN ROSIE prominent just off the inside, was boxed in on the rail
through the bend, gained a clear path inside the furlong marker, was crowded briefly with a sixteenth left but caught SCARLET POSITION for second near
the wire. SCARLET POSITION shared the early lead from inside, moved clear upper stretch, began to wear down inside the last eighth, drifted out briefly
under left-handed pressure with a sixteenth to go, was straightened and outfinished. COUNTRY ASSETS bumped with GHAALEB'S APPEAL at the start
then was briefly squeezed between rivals, pressed the early pace from between horses, two to four wide taking the turn and found best stride too late deep
stretch. GHAALEB'S APPEAL bumped at the break, contested the pace outside SCARLET POSITION, did not stay with that one upper stretch and ran
evenly the final furlong. R U FORREAL moved to the outside early on, came five wide into the lane and could only make up minor ground late.

Footnotes
MR. LUV MAKER was kept close from inside, rallied along the rail the last furlong and got up nearing the wire. UNCLE PAPPY showed first and set a
pressured pace between horses, gained the rail on the turn, floated out some entering the stretch, was crowded by VIRGA upper stretch as those two battle
for the lead, was slowly getting on despite steady right-handed pressure the final eighth, leaned on VIRGA until the waning yards and was outfinished.
BUDDY BUD hesitated then made a slight lunge from the gate, advanced widest, lost considerable ground four then five wide through the bend and found
best stride too late. VIRGA prominent between horses from the beginning, went for the lead outside UNCLE PAPPY on the turn, lugged in some upper
stretch to crowd UNCLE PAPPY briefly, was straightened, fought on even terms with the latter, was crowded by UNCLE PAPPY as that one gradually
drifted out inside the final eighth, lacked the extra needed in the waning yards and was checked when his path was compromised in the final stride before
the wire. RUDY'S BOY helped press the pace from between horses, did not keep up on the turn, swung out widest leaving the bend and showed a
willingness to run deep stretch. WEILAND pressed from outside on the backstretch, was three then four wide taking the turn then flattened out for the drive.
GREEN MEANS GO failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.
