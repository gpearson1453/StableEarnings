C J'S FLAIR stalked the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. HILLTOP HARMONY forced
the pace and had a slim lead on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. BLU COLLAR ROMANCE was off the pace,
raced evenly on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was the best of the rest. ALERT KITTEN was up close but chased on the turn and
had nothing left. SILLY SIMONE was off slow, lost ground on the turn and was empty.

QUALITY BREW stalked the early leader, was a factor on the far turn and with a bid from the five path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win.
SEAL TEAM TWO showed speed and set the pace, dueled on the far turn but with the lead from the four path in mid stretch was outgunned. LOQUACIOUS
was in touch, hustled along on the far turn and vied from the six path through the stretch but needed more. PRISON PADRE was unhurried early and trailed
the field on the far turn but angled out at the top of the stretch and rallied late. ONE POUND STERLING broke awkwardly and had a slim lead on the far turn
but gave way through the stretch.

NO RING showed speed from the inside, had the lead on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was much the best. HIPPIE CHICK
tracked the leader and was a factor on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. MADAME BOVERY was in
touch and had a good position on the far turn but leveled off. CALM IT was away alertly and raced evenly on the far turn but from the six path at the top of
the stretch was all out. SWEET SOCIETY was unhurried early and showed little while outrun. WIN LOSE OR STRAW was well back, trailed the field on the
far turn, pulled up in mid stretch and walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY GOING INTO THE FIRST TURN LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

Footnotes
MIDNITE SNACKATTAK was in touch, roused from the inside on the turn and with a bid in mid stretch drew clear. OPTIC stalked the early leader and was a
factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. GRIN N' BEAR was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the six
path at the top of the stretch was all out. BIG BAND BENNY was away alertly and had the lead on the turn but from the four path through the stretch had
nothing left. FRONT NINE was hustled early, trailed the field on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was no real threat.

SUMMER RETREAT set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. YALLHAVEANICEDAY
forced the pace, dueled on the turn and was second best in a good effort. PHIL IN THE BLANK was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the five
path at the top of the stretch needed more. MR CHANGUE was unhurried early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch evened out. BEEN WAITING was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. MARRIAGE COUNSELOR had no speed and was
roused on the turn but failed to fire. BALDUR was in touch but chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.
