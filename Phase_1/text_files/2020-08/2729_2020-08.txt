Footnotes
LAWN DART never far back, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, shook clear late and lasted. SOPHIE'S ANGEL
allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and missed. OUR PROMISE allowed to
settle, looped up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and missed the place. TEXAS MUSIC sprinted to a long lead
soon after the start, increased her margin through the turn, then weakened late and held a share. TIZ RED WINE chased the pace, saved ground on the two
path through the turn, bid on that path and weakened in the drive. COZZENE'S CAT showed little. FINDING PERFECTION was no factor.

Footnotes
K'S LITTLE BILL vied for the early lead on the inside, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, shook clear in the lane, then drew off and held under
steady pressure. NOPALITO allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up
for the place late. SAVE THE DRAMA well placed and inside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through inside, weakened late and held
the show. MR. CAT mid pack, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and had a mild gain. SWEET N SILVER allowed to
settle, looped three and four wide through the turn and improved his position in the lane. FEE WAIVER passed tiring rivals. TIZ WICKED set the pace on the
outside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then weakened the final furlong. PERFECT FORESTER allowed to settle, moved up three and four
wide through the turn, bid four wide and had no rally. LITTLE MATT mid pack and outside, faded through the turn. ANTEROS well placed, held position
three wide through the turn, bid on that path and faded the final furlong. LEAVEITALONELARRY was a brief factor, inside.
