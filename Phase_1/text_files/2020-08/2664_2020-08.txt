Footnotes
AMAZING AMERICAN broke alertly, narrowly showed the way into the turn along the inside, shook clear late in the bend, drew out, driving. AMANDAS
LIGHTENING settled off the pace toward the inside, advanced in the two path into the lane, chased the winner past the furlong marker, could do little with
that one to the wire, held sway late for the place. SPECIAL STORM with the pace three wide, closest to the winner turning for home, offered little resistance
to the runner up initially while inside that one mid stretch, coming back for the second spot late while also no match for the winner. CLASSY'S FAST ROY
broke back, lacked speed, roused four wide into the lane, improved slightly while not posing a serious threat. INLIKE FLEN vied up front while between
rivals and outside the winner, shuffled back into the turn, roused mid pack into the lane, went evenly through the stretch. BALD FACE LOGIC last away,
made little impact. CROOKED BANKER broke back, never close, lost contact with the field and jogged in late. THE ROCKS CRY OUT with the pace four
wide into the turn, gave way pulled up, walked in.

Footnotes
CLASSIC GREELEY away well, allowed the pace to go while in hand three wide through the first turn, continued to stalk in the run up the backstretch,
ranged up four wide to challenge turning for home, put a head in front approaching the furlong grounds, drove clear late under steady handling.
SINGINGINTHEWIND moved closer while four wide late in the first turn, pressed the issue from the outside up the backstretch, moved to challenge after a
half, narrowly showed the way through the final turn, vied between horses upper stretch, could not match the winner the final furlong, gained the nod for the
place at the wire while drifting in every so slightly. NINE IS MINE also pressured the leader early, advanced and challenged inside the runner up in the
second turn, appeared to come in slightly to tighten up a tiring JACK'S KISS exiting the final turn, also proved no match for the winner late, lost the nod for
the place spot while in a bit tight along the rail at the wire. JACK'S KISS broke alertly, cleared to the inside into the first turn, continued to show the way up
the backstretch and into the far turn, headed soon after, appeared to be tiring when steadied in tight along the rail into the lane, evenly through the lane
while continuing to lose ground to the winner. EL HOMBRE in some traffic into the first turn, eased out and clipped heels across a rivals heels, advanced to
mid pack before a half, asked along far turn, continued to improve position slightly without posing a threat through the stretch. STRIKING STAR settled off
the pace, came three wide into the stretch, was not dangerous in the drive while remaining out in the strip. DREWTEMPO broke back, lacked speed, failed
to menace. HOPE FOR VALUE last to leave, raced well back in trailing much of the way while far out in the strip, continued well wide into the lane, picked
off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. VIVINSKY forwardly placed off the inside, in some traffic with a half mile remaining, began to
weakened in the second turn, continued to fade stretch. BAND BOSS finished early, giving way when four wide turning for home. FOLLOWING
STEWARDS' INQUIRIES REGARDING THE RUN INTO THE FIRST TURN AND EXITING THE FINAL TURN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

STREAMER broke well, settled off the pace toward the inside, moved out, advanced, took over, drew out, driving. KAITLYN'S COURT in mid pack early,
advanced three wide into the stretch, proved no match for the winner in the run to the wire, held sway for the place late. BABY MAYBE last away, void of
speed, improved inside of some rivals second turn, steered out for the drive, slowly gaining for the place. STEPH'S SPIRIT took command after the start,
well clear after a half, faltered when headed by the winner turning for home. TAYLOR'S WISH lacked speed, improved position without posing a serious
threat. TETHEREDTOTHETRUTH remained back in failing to menace. SHELLEYS A WARRIOR forwardly placed in the early going, began a steady retreat
before a half. WHO DAT GREY chased the issue early, stopped and finished far back.

Footnotes
SOONER SCHOONER broke back, remained void of speed in the run up the backstretch, rallied four wide into the lane, closed with good energy to win
going away. VIVA CAT off a step slow, lagged back early, rallied five wide and outside the winner turning for home, could not keep pace with that rival while
still finishing willingly to be clearly second best. ROSE RUNNER dueled early along the inside, fell back off the other speed through the turn, moved out,
rebid to take the advantage a furlong out, no match for the top two, saved the show late. FRUHL'N AROUND settled off the pace, saved ground through the
turn, continued in even fashion through the lane to improve slightly. MIZ NIGHTCAP dueled up the backstretch off the inside, shook clear briefly late in the
turn, faltered in the final furlong. SILENT TRICK void of speed for a half, saved ground, shifted out midstretch, passed tiring rivals. WARRIORS SPEAK
lacked speed, made little impact. RUBY RED SLIPPERS within striking distance in the second flight early, gave way in the drive. HEATHER DIVINE also
had nothing for the drive. JEWEL OF THE SKY chased the dueling leaders up the backstretch and through the turn, backed up in the drive.

wide into the lane, angled in for the stretch run, finished willingly to be up late for the show. JAZZ MUSIC dueled up front closest to the inside, off the inside
for the drive, weakened through the stretch. INTERACTIF MOMENT in the second flight along the inside, gradually tired in the drive. DISTINCT QUALITY

comfortable advantage through the lane while being kept to pressure. LOOKING FOR BULL settled off the pace while four wide through the first turn,
continued on the outside to be four wide through the second bend, rallied for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. LIAM SKYE chased the dueling
leaders early, advanced to be closest to the winner into and through upper stretch, caught late for the place. REMEMBERMIS lacked speed, three wide
through the final turn, lacked a serious closing kick in the drive. HIDEAWAY HERO back off the early pace, improved gradually the final three furlongs also
was not a serious threat through the stretch. DOUBLE COOL five wide into the first turn, lacked speed, five wide exiting the final bend, picked off a couple of
faltering rivals. PHILLY raced in the second flight for six furlongs, had little left for the stretch run. CAJUN PINATA remained always back. ONEHOLYLION
dueled up front outside the winner for just under four furlongs, stopped far turn.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED HALO broke alertly, clear in the run up the backstretch, headed in the turn, set down for the drive, battled back while remaining inside, fully
extended. CUSTOM KAT settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground into the lane, rallied up the inside to finish willingly and be clear for the place.
BIG COUNT chased the winner early off the inside, engaged that rival and put a head in front entering the stretch, continued to show the way past the
furlong then faltered, narrowly saving the show. CLEVER PRINCE broke out, raced back and outside, four wide into the lane, displayed some mild interest
to improve position. COACH O broke slowly, moved up through traffic to within striking distance the opening quarter, continued to race forwardly through the
turn and into the stretch, had little left late. LONE STAR CLASS broke out, went one paced throughout while four wide most of the way. ZIPPIT ZIPPY
bothered slightly at the start, raced in the main body for a half, lacked a response when called on for the drive. K FOR KOHEN void of speed, made little
impact. TENSAS GOLD off a bit slow, was never a factor. MAY SUN CAN RUN fell back to trail most of the way to be always outrun. SMOKEY GAVIN
steadily faded while racing wide.

Footnotes
MISTY DAY broke back, began a three wide advance in the turn, challenged outside the two early leaders when straightened for home, drove clear late
under steady handling. TENSAS THOUGHT in the second flight inside, moved out, bid, dueled upper stretch, proved no match for the winner late, held
sway for the place. SILVER SQUALL in mid pack off the inside, loomed a threat four wide turning for home, failed to sustain that advance in the drive.
ALOHA BETTY broke alertly, sprinted well clear soon after, showed the way through the turn, dueled closest to the inside upper stretch, weakened final
furlong. GALAXY THIRTYSIX broke back with the winner, lacked speed, five wide through the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing
response. FLEETA BELLE void of speed in trailing most of the way, failed to muster a rally. TIZ THE FAITH main group early, began a steady fade before
three furlongs. HALF MILE SPLIT MISSING DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
VIKING VOYAGE broke on top, set the pace off the inside, well wide into the stretch, not threatened to the wire under a moderate hand ride to win ridden
out. BETTY GETS BETTER chased the winner inside, proved no match in the drive, fully extended to hold the runner up spot late. TRIBUTE GALAXY last
to leave, lacked early foot, came five wide out of the turn, finished willingly to be getting to the runner up. MISSBUDLITELIME chased the winner early
outside the runner up, had little left for the drive. PEACH'S SWAN SONG remained always back in failing to threaten. SPEAK BRILEY settled off the pace
and the inside, had nothing for the drive.
