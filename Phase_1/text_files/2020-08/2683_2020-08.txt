Footnotes
BLUE SUADE GUITAR stalked the pace while racing three wide down the backstretch, took command nearing the far turn and was well clear late under
steady handling. LUNA stalked the pace, raced towards the inside and was no match for the winner. HOLY MOSEY showed good speed from the inside and
lacked a late response through the drive. DISCO PARTY settled off the early pace, saved ground and had no rally. DAH PHILLY raced five wide around the
first turn, dropped back in the early stages, raced six wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. OLA GATITA failed to have a response. SHE MAKES
ME SMILE pressed the early pace and tired readily.

through the lane and had not enough late. MORE THAN MILES showed good early speed, raced five wide into the upper stretch, angled in late and
weakened in the latter stages. EMPTY HOLSTER stalked the pace along the inside, raced four wide through the stretch and had no response. MONSTER

ROLLING PALISADES set all the pace along the inside and held gamely to be clear under strong urging. IN THE LOOP pressed the early pace, dropped
back a bit around the far turn, raced in the five path through the stretch and got up for the place position late. EXTRA MEDIUM stalked the pace, saved
ground down the backstretch into the upper stretch, angled four wide through the drive and had not enough. KEVIN WITTE was allowed to settle off the
going , raced towards the inside and had no response. RATTLESNAKE RIDGE failed to sustain a bid.

handling. MADAME ROUGE showed good early speed while racing two wide down the backstretch, raced four wide nearing the eighth pole, led deep
stretch but couldn't hold off the winner near the wire. RUBY'S RUSH settled off the early pace, raced five wide through the drive and showed good late
interest. TALKS IN HER SLEEP was slow early, raced three deep in the lane and made a mild late gain. TOURBILLON ROSE dropped back early, raced
seven wide into the upper stretch and had no rally. A P GEM pressed the pace from the outside and gave way. SCADS stalked the pace, raced six deep
into the upper stretch and had no response. VICTORY TIME settled off the pace and failed to have a response. KAROL G stalked the pace and faded.
BRASS BERET raced towards the inside throughout and never was a factor.

Footnotes
DEMO DOCTOR showed good early speed, raced just off the inside throughout, built a long lead in the stretch under strong pressure and was in hand late.
YOU ARE AWESOME was allowed to settle early, moved up along the inside nearing the quarter pole, angled five wide through the lane and got up for the
place position late. WICKED FINN tracked the leader while racing along the inside down the backstretch and weakened a bit in the drive. RUSH HENRY
RUSH stalked early and lacked a late response. MUCHACHO MACHO stalked the pace while racing near the inside and weakened. THEDUKE OF
HAZZARD was forced six wide around the first turn, raced four wide in the lane and never was a factor. PIRATE'S PALACE raced five wide around the first
turn and never was a factor. NEVERMINDNINETYONE was slow early and never threatened. HANLEY failed to have a response.
