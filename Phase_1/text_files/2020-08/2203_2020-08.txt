Footnotes
DAMA LEONA slow early advanced on the turn looming from mid track in upper stretch edging clear under a drive. WILD TYPE away alertly set the pace
through the turn, hooked from the outside in mid stretch would cede grudgingly late. GO PLACIDLY slow early gave a mild rally to upper stretch outbidding
the others. MYHEARTSINTHECITY raced evenly to upper stretch lacking a late response there. DAILY FEATURE saved ground racing evenly through the
lane as no menace. DREAM PARK slow early raced wide. TOUGH OLD BIRD chased through the turn tiring in upper stretch. PRECIOUS BETH bumped at
the break raced evenly through the turn giving way in upper stretch.
