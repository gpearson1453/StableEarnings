Footnotes
RUN SOME KOPPY'S stalked the pace, responded to her cue in the stretch and reeled in RANBIR. The latter sprinted clear, held well into the stretch and
shortened stride late. EMMY GOT EVEN chased along the inside and lacked a rally. CANELA CALIENTE passed tired ones. BLONDIES MINE chased the
pacesetter and dropped back on the turn. IRISH MUSIC never menaced. BABY LYLLY was always outrun.
