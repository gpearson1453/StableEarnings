Footnotes
PRINCESS NOOR quickly cleared and controlled the pace near the inside, inched away into the stretch and remained clear while in hand late. FLASH
MAGIC tracked four deep then outside a rival, angled out four to five wide on the turn, took aim at the winner but proved no match while clearly second best.
AVISSE up close just outside of the leader, pressed upon while three wide around the turn, drifted to the inside in the lane and held the show. PEACHTREE
ROAD crossed over and impeded foe SHANGHAI GROOVE early, chased outside a rival then three deep on the turn, in a bit tight between runners at the
three-sixteenths and flattened in the final furlong. FROSTED BLUE stalked along the fence then came off the rail a bit and lacked further response. LADY
MO stumbled at the start, stalked outside a rival, dropped back on the turn, entered the stretch three wide and had little left for the drive. SHANGHAI
GROOVE chased between rivals then checked and clipped heels behind PEACHTREE ROAD, raced wide through the turn and was not persevered with in
the late stages. THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED PEACHTREE ROAD FROM FOURTH TO LAST FOR CROSSING OVER AND CAUSING SHANGHAI
GROOVE TO CHECK AND CLIP HEELS EARLY IN THE RACE.

Footnotes
CHAOS THEORY settled early off the inside, entered the turn two wide then moved out into the three path, steered out further in the drive, rallied outside
the leader and reeled in foe. BAJA SUR stalked the lone leader from the inside through the turn, showed late interest from the inside and edged a pair of
rivals for the place. TOROSAY stalked outside of BAJA SUR to the stretch, angled out in the lane then back inside when MIKES TIZNOW drifted out, kept
on willingly and edged that rival for the show. MIKES TIZNOW sped to the front and moved into the two path, drifted out in the lane and led clear to the
sixteenth pole but faltered late. MESUT trailed the field outside a rival, went two to three wide around the turn, then showed some response to urging and
gained ground late. SPARKY VILLE traveled along the fence into the turn, moved a bit off the rail into the lane and lacked a serious bid. IRISH HEATWAVE
tracked a bit off the rail, angled out into the stretch and never threatened. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HARVEST MOON stalked off the fence, went outside PROVOCATION at the five-sixteenths and angled in around the far turn, bid alongside SECRET
KEEPER into the stretch, dueled through the final furlong and edged clear. SECRET KEEPER sped to the front and angled in on the first turn, set the pace
under pressure to the outside, lost command at the nine-sixteenths then re-gained the advantage at the seven-sixteenths, led through the far turn and met
the bid from HARVEST MOON into the lane, fought with that rival in the drive, drifted out a bit past the eighth pole and got outkicked in deep stretch. PAIGE
ANNE off alertly from the inside, chased a bit off the rail then along the inside and saved ground to the stretch, drifted out in the lane and held the show.
AURELIA GARLAND tracked four wide through both turns and never summoned a bid. PROVOCATION prompted the pace from outside, took over at the
nine-sixteenths marker, lost command at the seven-sixteenths, dropped back around the turn and gave way. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL checked between early,
angled in on the first turn, stayed inside to the lane then came out in upper stretch and never threatened.

furlong but got outfinished. BAM BAM AGAIN tracked outside a rival then off the rail, went three wide into the stretch, bumped with rival at the eighth pole
and kept on willingly for the show. ALL I CAN SAY traveled near the back of the field, split rivals near the seven-sixteenths pole, came out on the turn and
exited the bend five wide, came with a mild late bid and earned a minor award. BABY GRONK chased along the inside, angled out into the two path on the
turn, went between foes and bumped at the eighth pole, then finished evenly in the late stages. TACO WACO chased outside a rival then between foes on
the turn, angled in around the bend, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened. ROGALLO raced mid-pack, angled inward and asked entering the turn,
raced in the two path to the drive and came up empty. SHINNY broke in and bumped rival at the start, raced wide into the turn, angled in traveled three to
four wide into the stretch but proved no menace. SURPRISE FASHION chased inside then came out into the stretch and was never a factor. JU JU GUY
bumped from the outside and stumbled at the start, angled to the inside, moved out on the turn and was always outrun. DOHENY BEACH raced off the
pace and off the inside, moved out and entered the stretch six wide and had little left for the drive. SHANGHAI CURLY raced two wide into the stretch and
never threatened.

Footnotes
RED KING reserved in the earl going, advanced quickly from the outside up the backstretch, challenged four deep at the three-eighths, dueled into the
stretch, drew clear from that inside rival then held the runner-up at bay. UNITED stalked from the inside, moved closer into the far turn, angled out around
that bend, came four wide into the stretch, rallied steadily outside the leader but could not get by. ORIGINAIRE (IRE) unhurried in the beginning, moved
over to the inside to race a bit off the rail then outside a rival, bothered by outside foe at the quarter pole, came out into the stretch and finished with a late
rally. PROUD PEDRO (FR) allowed to settled near the inside, moved out into the three path and further out in the stretch, finished well but lost the show.
OSCAR DOMINGUEZ (IRE) tracked inside, saved ground into the lane, angled out in the drive and showed late interest. ANOTHER MYSTERY tracked a
bit off the rail, moved to the inside, angled three wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. NORTH COUNTY GUY stalked outside the leader then between
foes, chased the top pair up the backstretch then bid three deep into the far turn, gained command then dueled with the winner into the stretch and
weakened in the late stages. WARD 'N JERRY chased outside the leader then pressed the pace, gained command near the five-eighths, vied between foes
into the final turn, lost ground into the stretch and faded. COMBATANT raced off the rail, four wide into the lane and weakened. BIG BUZZ sped to the front,
set the pace under pressure to the outside, lost command at the five-eighths, stayed inside then re-bid at the three-eighths, challenged around the final turn
then tired in the drive. NEW YEAR chased five wide leaving the first turn, angled in the first time through the stretch, remained off the rail and steadied past
the seven-sixteenths pole, traveled five wide into the lane and had little left. HAND TIMED.

TAKE THE ONE O ONE sped clear to take control, inched away into the stretch and drew away under urging. KERSHAW tracked the leader off the inside,
went three wide into the far turn, angled out and came five wide into the stretch and rallied for the place. POTANTICO stumbled at the start, stalked along
the inside, came out into the drive and closed for the show. LOUD MOUTH stalked outside the leader, put to a drive two to three wide around the second
turn and flattened in the drive. EXTRA HOPE pulled into the first turn, raced a bit off the rail then steered out and came four wide into the stretch but failed to
threaten. RESPECT THE HUSTLE allowed to settle off the rail, exited the final turn two to three wide and was never a factor. UNBROKEN STAR pulled on
the fist turn, tracked off the rail, four wide then five wide on the final turn and weakened.

Footnotes
RED LARK (IRE) settled off the rail, angled in nearing the clubhouse turn, traveled a bit off the rail then moved out into the three path, drifted out in the
stretch, reeled in the leader and drew clear. CALIFORNIA KOOK trailed the field near the fence, swung five wide leaving the turn, rallied late and earned the
place. WARREN'S SHOWTIME stalked outside a rival, took over in upper stretch, cleared briefly but could not match the top pair in the final sixteenth.

a mild response. THREE AY EM settled outside a rival then three wide off the fence, came out at the three-sixteenths pole and finished willingly. OSTINI
