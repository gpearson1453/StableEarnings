Footnotes
HOBOKEN HUSTLE hustled along to the turn, went outside, settle down and smartly drew off. PROM THEME had a sluggish start, ran on into turn while
roused to get along for place. ROBOTRON trailed early on, floated wide into stretch, motored along for show. LIL POM POM good position outside to the
stretch, flattened out in the drive. IVY O'DAY went to knock heads on the lead to quarter pole, backed up inside. BUCH OF DAISIES void of any speed from
the gate, passed a couple in the stretch. OLDFASHIONED ANGEL rushed and hustled along to the turn, used up, and dropped back. MOUNT EAGLE
never a real factor.

Footnotes
AUTHENTIC COWTOWN led in hand off the rail, responded to a stiff challenge in the stretch and dug in, refusing to let that foe get by in the final yards.
FOREVER DIAMOND prompted the winner to the far turn, got closer to challenge for the lead, battled stoutly down the stretch but was denied in the final
yards, though close. LETSGETITSEVENTEEN was up close to the far turn, asked to get closer while five wide, moved inside to rally in the stretch and
evened out late. EDGE OF NIGHT raced outside, floated out a horse in upper backstretch, made a mild rally while three wide on the far turn and improved
in the stretch. TING TANG tracked inside, was roused on the far turn, stayed even to deep stretch and lost position while lacking the needed kick. ONE
CRAZY RIDE bounced between horses at the start, rode the rail, angled out a bit on the far turn, dove back inside in the stretch and held position.
ESTRELLA DE DANE trailed but improved position in the stretch. BETCHAIWILL raced off the pace, was floated out in upper backstretch and posed no
threat.

Footnotes
SEA ADMIRAL sprinted clear on the lead, well handled throughout and held sway to the wire. MUCHO MACHO BETS shuffled back to the wire first time
around, rallied along steadily and cut the margin late. DETERMINATOR dueled and with pace to deep stretch but leveled off in the late.going. MURRY
SPUR loped along on the rail to far turn, floated out for the drive with a mild late gain. CREATIVE COURAGE raced evenly with no response when called
upon. JUNKET failed to menace. AQUADINI perfect position to far turn, out of gas, faded. MARK MY WAY rushed outside first turn, with pace to far turn but
used up and came up empty. SPRING SOLO was through early and dropped back readily. ESCALERA lost best chance at the start and never close.
FRED'S COUNTRY BOY never a contender.

Footnotes
PERSONALLY waited, rolled past foes on the turn five wide, was bumped in the stretch and wore down the leader to get the win. BIZBY raced mid pack,
cruised past a lone leader on the far turn, maintained an advantage down the stretch, bumped a horse late and was worn down to settle for place in he final
stages. ANNMARIA was off slow, raced at the rail early, angled out on the turn, bumped between horses and steadied down the stretch, then held position
late. DEAR THEODOSIA stayed back and closed well while off the rail down the lane. REAL LATE raced inside mid pack, shifted out very wide on the turn
while moving up and improved position in the stretch. TINGSTHATMAKESENSE chased a clear leader, had the rail in the stretch but came up empty. TOO
SHORT came within range of the leaders in the stretch but faded in the final furlong. FIVE O'CLOCK was no threat. BLUEJEANLADY couldn't keep pace on
the turn. MISS EMMA'S SONG chased in the second flight, came wide into the stretch, crossed the wire but was vanned off. SHE'S EDGY sped clear early,
faltered inside on the turn and tired down the lane. An objection lodged by the rider of ANNMARIA against BIZBY alledging interference in the stretch was
upheld by the stewards and BIZBY was disqualified from second to third, while ANNMARIA was placed second. An objection lodged by the rider of BIZBY
against PERSONALLY alledging interference in the stretch was disallowed by the stewards.
