Footnotes
EXACTA broke out, early pace, fell back, moved out, went back after the leader when straightened for home, outside bid, edged clear. SPELLBINDING
pressed outside, briefly clear after a half, dueled upper stretch and past the furlong marker, could not match the winner late, well clear of the others. MISS
CHARLIE SIOUX settled in mid pack, came three wide into the lane, rallied for the show, no threat to the top two.l. GATOR PROUD lacked early foot, rallied
three wide into the lane, improved position while not a serious threat. SEVEN COME ELEVEN four wide into the first turn, settled off the pace, had little left
for the drive. LABRUNA raced in mid pack, four wide into the stretch, lacked a closing kick. BIRDCATMOUSE pinched back at the start, four wide into the
first turn, failed to menace. GO MY JULIET five wide into the first turn when lacking speed, remained back while also wide through the second turn. BE A
BANDIT forwardly placed in the early going, began to fade after a half. PADIOLI was also finished early.

Footnotes
HALF OURS N STORMY with the pace form the start in the two path, disposed of the other speed turning for home, roused, kicked strongly and well clear,
kept to task. KING BAYOU settled off the pace and the inside, came five wide into the stretch, some late interest to be up for the place, no match for the
winner. GOLDEN PALACE within striking distance, in the three path turning for home, set down for the drive, lacked a closing punch, nipped late for the
place. RIVER KING lacked early foot, came in the three path while under a right handed stick into the lane, shifted out a bit for the drive, improved slightly
while never dangerous. NINE SHOTS pressed the issue three wide for a half then faltered in the drive. ROSES N' RUBIES void of speed, raced outside,
four wide into the lane, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. BIG BOSS MAN flashed brief speed inside the winner and
stopped. TIGER ROAD was never involved.

Footnotes
GOTTA GO stalked the pace off the inside, advanced and engaged the leader into the stretch, dueled past the furlong marker and wore that same foe down
under steady handling. INDEPENDENT WORKER moved up after the start to show the way in to the first turn along the inside, continued to set the pace the
middle half, responded when the winner came alongside entering the straight, gave ground grudgingly to that rival until late, held sway for the place in the
waning strides. TREYS MIDNITE MOON settled off the pace and the inside, between foes when beginning to advance turning for home, roused, closing the
gap on the top two late. PINCH ASSAULT last away, raced back, improved slightly without posing a threat to the top three. KING OF THE TESTO pressed
the issue early, began to steadily fade after a half. CARBONATED had little left for the drive. FRACTIONAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HOG WILD broke alertly, cleared to the inside to show the way into the first turn, vied into the lane while remaining closest to the inside, shook off those
rivals when straightened for home and kicked well clear. GO ORTEGO GO forwardly placed out of the gate, pressed three wide and between rivals through
the turn, could do little with the winner in the drive, edged clear for the place. JAYS RIVERWRANGLER off a step slow, raced back, asked along midway on
the turn, four wide into the lane, continued with a mild advance to be along for the show. MAIL MAN JOHNNY pressed the issue early, chased the winner
while toward the inside into and through upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong to close a couple of positions. DAVES FRIEND DEWEY remained back
in failing to menace. IMA SUNNY SONG broke back and failed to threaten. BREGMAN off a bit slow, was never close. GOOD TIMES ROLLIN prompted the
issue for a quarter outside, four out to five wide late in the turn, tired in the drive. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL TIME IS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SALT LIFE ANGEL broke alertly, showed the way out of the chute, clear into the turn, maintained daylight into the stretch and was not threatened to the wire
under continued steady handling. CABO SUNSET moved up after the start to be closest to the winner early, continued to pursue that one through the turn,
proved no match in the drive, lasted for the place. CLASSY BIRDETTE in mid pack for a half toward the inside, roused from between rivals turning for home,
closed with some interest to be getting to the runner up late. MISSGREELEY'SSONG forwardly placed while racing along the inside, saved ground to no
avail in lacking a closing response. NITRA lacked early foot toward the rail, asked along, angled out four wide turning for home, improved position down the
middle of the strip without posing a serious threat. SHEZA MEAN BROAD void of early foot, continued to lag early in the turn, saved ground into the lane to
improve position, flattened out a bit in the final furlong. SUDDEN AFLEET within striking distance outside, raced four wide through the turn, tired in the drive.
BELINDA was finished early. SUNDIAL STAR off a step slow, raced back, was five wide out of the turn, lacked a rally. REASON TO WALTZ broke back and
was always outrun. MYLIE IDEL forwardly placed in the early going, steadily retreated three wide.

Footnotes
SOCIAL MISFIT forwardly placed toward the inside, collared leader, drove well clear. BLAME THE THIEF outrun in the early going, came four wide into the
stretch, rallied well out in the strip, up late for the place, no threat to the winner. LITTLE TOE broke alertly, set the pace inside, offered little resistance to the
winner when that one took over turning for home, chased that rival past the furlong marker, caught late for the 2nd spot. KING PTOLEMY settled off the
pace, went evenly throughout in lacking a closing response. RANDY PAUL void of speed for a half, improved into the stretch, failed to sustain that advance
the final furlong. B RASEN broke a step slow and failed to menace. LUCKY ANDY chased the leader for five furlongs, faltered. CHAOSMOS forwardly
placed outside, tired while five wide exiting the final turn. DUTCHMAN trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
GUILTY LADY in the second flight while racing inside, encountered some traffic late in the final turn, steered out three wide entering the stretch, set down,
finished with good energy to collar the leader late and win going away. INCOMING WIRE broke on top, sprinted well clear soon after, maintained a large
advantage onto the backstretch, shook off one pursuer when straightened for home, clear again past the furlong marker, no match for the winner late,
clearly best of the others. GOTTABEGOLDEN allowed to settle off the pace and the inside, within striking distance into the far turn, went evenly through the
lane in lacking a closing punch. MIGHTY PEGASUS void of speed, came four wide into the stretch, lugged in a bit past the furlong marker, was
straightened, improved position late. ZOLA went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. CATCAKE also turned in an even effort while racing
off the inside. LUCKY LINZ chased the runner up early, went after that one and challenged into the far turn, raced on even terms through that bend then
faltered in the drive. ROMAN JEWELS off slowly, was racing back when carried very wide into the first turn, remained back. GRILLIN void of early foot, bore
out badly into the first turn carrying ROMAN JEWELS very wide, remained far back throughout.

Footnotes
SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE broke on top, showed the way into the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch, drew out through the lane while
being kept to task. POWER JET settled early off the pace, asked along in the second turn, steered three wide for the drive, finished willingly to be clearly
second best. BOLD THIRST forwardly placed off the rail, moved closest to the winner before a half, chased that one into and through the final turn, proved
no match for that one in the drive or the runner up, comfortably saved the show. SILVER KING last away, devoid of speed for five furlongs, improved
position slightly while never dangerous. STANDING MAN closest to the winner early, had nothing left for the drive. ATLANTIC RULER was finished early.

Footnotes
SAPONI lacked early foot, moved out, came six wide out of the turn when commencing his rally, closed with good resolve to be up in time. COACH O'SHEA
broke alertly, set the early pace toward the inside, got clear along the rail through the turn, extended that advantage through upper stretch, could not contain
the winner in the final strides. REACH THE CIRCLE settled off the pace while outside, rallied five wide and inside the winner turning for home, could not
match that one late but still finished willingly to be getting to the runner up. GEM OF CARLOS pressed the runner up early off the inside, chased that same
rival through the turn and into the lane, drifted out badly past the furlong marker to lose position, finished up evenly. WHATAFIND trailed early toward the
inside, continued to save ground turn, improved into the lane and was making some progress late up the rail. LA CLEVER in the second flight inside,
checked up in tight quarters along the rail late backstretch, quickly recovered to improve a bit into the lane then flattened out in the late going. PILLAGE DA
VILLAGE broke in a tangle, remained always back in failing to threaten. RHETT N' SCARLETT forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch, tired from
those early efforts. MUSADA in the second flight for three furlongs, backed up in the drive.
