D'TATWAY tracked the early pace, went six wide through the turn, took control in late stretch and edged clear. OUR IRIS ROSE set a pressured pace,
raced off the rail, couldn't sustain the run and finished second best. SELECTION PARK was unhurried early, raced between rivals and was evenly late. TAP
INTO BEAUTY was allowed to settle, went four wide into the turn and offered no late rally. CASA BONITA was void of any early speed, went five wide into
the turn and never fired. CATCHY RYTHM raced in mid pack early, raced between rivals and faded. SUPER HUMOR was up close early, went three wide
and weakened. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
