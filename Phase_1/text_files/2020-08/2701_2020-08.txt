SOLO RING saved ground while setting pace, took pressure into the final turn inside of ROMAN STEEL and edged away at the top of the stretch. WYE
CROSS sat mid pack from just off the rail, shifted out to the four path, drifted inward at the top of the stretch and was up in time for place. ROMAN STEEL
broke out leaving, sat in striking range from the four path, moved up alongside SOLO RING to challenge the lead, lacked the rally needed into the stretch
and was edged out late. TRADER LYNN trailed the field early then was asked to quicken entering the lane and lacked the kick needed. FLAT OUT LEADER
broke inward, raced from the back of the pack and lacked a serious bid into the stretch. WILSMAN prompted the pace, race in close quarters entering the
far turn, lodged a bid into lane and gave way. HERE COMES BARNEY squeezed out leaving then hustled into contention and faded.

GONE LONG GONE bumped away from the gate, inched forward through the far turn, coaxed outside into the lane, rallied determinedly outside and wore
down leader. PRINCESS PONTI broke inward then chased two wide into the far turn, was headed into the lane, responded to challenge from GONE LONG
GONE and was worn down late. SPANISH DIVA reared way from the gate, gained closer order through the turn and closed steadily late. AMBER RIDGE
sprinted to the turn and had nothing left in reserve late. SMOKE N' CHROME broke outward bumping outside rival, sat in striking distance then dropped
back and tired. WHO DAT SCHRAM was outrun throughout. DANS LA ROSE stumbled at the break and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
EL DORADO STORM sent for speed inside, gained advantage over CHICKALETTY through the turn, responded to looming threat from the fore mentioned
and stayed clear under pressure. CHICKALETTY out sprinted to the turn, moved up menacingly at the head of the stretch but was unable to stall the winner.
IGNITE THE MOON hustled inside, closed gap but was no threat to the leaders. GOLDSHAFT chased outside then was two wide through the turn and
offered a late mild rally. LORD STANLEY lacked running room approaching the opening turn then swung out and showed a mild interest late.
IMACLASSICMEN away slow, chased the leaders into the turn and gave way with a furlong and a half remaining. ELECTRIC FEEL offered little. **Delay of
race due to a loose horse on post parade and equipment adjustment for GOLDSHAFT.

Footnotes
DENSE FOG contested the early pace leaving the chute, led the field into the far turn while saving ground, was given cue at the quarter pole then led clear
into the drive under handling. BACKSTREET BOBBY sat just off the pace from the four path, was asked to quicken approaching the quarter pole, drifted
inward under right handed encouragement, floated by RUCK and kept on for second. RUCK showed good early speed, tracked the pace inside, was coaxed
through the final turn inside of BACKSTREET BOBBY, lacked running room inside at the top of the stretch then angled out and flattened out. OUR
DANDY'S BOY raced in seconded flight while four wide, raced in close quarters into the far turn and bid belatedly. A. F. INDY never far back then was
brushed leaving the backstretch inside then was roused into the lane but was unable to improve contention. ANELLO never reached contention. RAINY
BAY allowed to settle in range and retired early.

VISION QUEST sped to the front and set the pace clear from the two path, responded to challenge from SMILEY at the head of the lane and won driving.
TRIPLE LIVE saved ground mid pack, advanced inside under encouragement through the final turn, closed gradually but was no threat to the winner.
BARLEY BOY settled outside in second flight, took closer order leaving the far turn, took aim three wide into the lane and kept on for show. SMALL TOWN
DUDE raced at the back of the pack, gained closer order then angled out at the three sixteenth pole and bid late stretch. SMILEY hurried along rail into
stalking position, steadied at the seven sixteenth pole, gained a slim advantage briefly inside and gave way. POOR RUBEN trailed the field then chased
leaving the backstretch and lacked a closing response. TUXEDO MASK went wide through the backstretch and never reached contention. KICKEN WEST
G. chased three wide in the early stages and came up empty in drive.

checked inside, angled out and won driving. EVERYTHING'S QUIET quickly went to the front under a strong hold, refused to let outside rival have the
advantage leaving the backstretch, responded to challenge into entering the lane then weakened inside late and held on second. PENNY A POINT chased
along the rail, swung out into the lane, hung early stretch then closed late and missed. SPECIAL BRANDY settled outside early, took closer order
approaching the quarter pole and summoned a mild rally. EMMA JEAN TOO trailed the field and offered a mild late bid. GEM OF INCEPTION raced from
second flight while four wide and lacked a serious bid. INSTANT WYN outrun throughout. SESAME pressed the early pace while five wide into the
backstretch, was unable to keep pace with the field into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
LUCKY LAST NIGHT sat in striking distance outside, inched closer under a snug hold, fanned four wide leaving the backstretch, overtook the leader into the
stretch and won driving. ARCTIC REIGN set a pressured pace from the three path, was overtaken with a furlong remaining and held second. GUNN WITH
THE WIND sat in range outside, rallied steadily through the drive and missed. IMPERIAL WOOD advanced outside in the far turn, was brushed at the
quarter pole and lacked the rally needed. MARIA'S MAGIC prompted the early pace from a rail position, dropped back leaving the final turn, re-bid into the
stretch and flattened out. LOOKIN FOR MADDIE lagged early, chased, swung out into the lane, drifted inward and passed tiring. LEGS ARE DIAMOND
pressed the pace while three wide and retired early. FLANDERLAND sat mid pack and offered little. FORMAL TUX tracked inside early, lost ground inside
leaving the backstretch and retreated. DIAVAL lacked early foot and failed to recover from the start.
