Footnotes
FLORALA AL was difficult to load, bumped with ATTU ISLAND at the start, vied outside several opponents early, cleared off into the turn staying well out in
the track, widened the advantage after three furlongs and was kept busy to the finish. CON PERMISO moved out four or five wide near the quarter-pole,
and finished well outside to clearly best the remainder. COMPETITIVE HERO hit the left side of the gate and was slow to begin, was strung out five wide
into the turn just off the leaders, and ran on without a bid to wind up a distant third. PUGIN vied three wide between rivals early, and weakened before
reaching the stretch. VALEROSO stumbled at the start, moved in trailing early on the turn, stayed inside and improved past tired horses. ROYAL MEETING
contested the early pace inside several foes, and gave way after three-eighths of a mile. MASTER Q argued the early pace between horses, and faded
steadily through the lane. HIGHLY NOTED moved out four wide around the turn, and could not reach contention. ATTU ISLAND bumped with FLORALA AL
at the start, showed early speed between horses, checked sharply past the half-mile pole, and dropped far back after three furlongs. The first quarter-mile of
this race was hand timed.

Footnotes
LIV AND LET LIV was a step slow at the start, ran up behind the leaders and steadied lacking room on the rail past the half-mile pole, gained clearance
advancing after three furlongs, moved out and took over from WORLD GONE WILD readily at the top of the stretch, went clear staying on her left lead, and
had enough to hang on inside rivals. SILVER PACKAGE stayed close early inside, moved out three wide looming a threat past the quarter-pole, lugged in
through upper stretch, straightened out and was getting to the winner late. RACE DAY SPEED broke out while coming away alertly, raced three wide
around the turn in range, ran on outside the leaders and was gradually closing in near the finish. TABERNACLE was no factor four wide. WORLD GONE
WILD sped clear early a bit off the rail, moved inside on the turn, and gave way readily when challenged by the eventual winner. CRYSTAL SKY was ridden
along after a quarter-mile, and had no response. NAG NAG NAG showed brief speed, but faltered soon after completing the first quarter.

FRANCO'S TEAM steadied slightly between horses at the start, ranged up confidently four wide outside the leaders approaching the stretch, took over
outside AWESOME ENOUGH past the eighth-pole, and was fully stretched to best that foe while remaining on his left lead. AWESOME ENOUGH was
crowded by FELON and pushed into WHISKEY BENT at the start, moved through along the rail joining the front flight five-sixteenths out, reached a short
lead in mid stretch, and fought back gamely after being overtaken. FELON broke out causing crowding, sped clear slightly off the rail, yielded to challengers
from both flanks in upper stretch, moved outside and ran on with good courage. SOUPER SHENANIGAN gave chase three wide between horses on the
turn, and weakened through the lane on his left lead. WHISKEY BENT got pushed out by AWESOME ENOUGH at the start, showed brief speed, and gave
way around the turn.

Footnotes
DONA CAMILE came away in good order and pressed CLARIST from outside, took over midway on the turn, widened the lead into the stretch under a
drive, and was taken in hand the last sixteenth of a mile. MIRANDA SOFIA raced three wide around the turn, moved into second after completing a
half-mile, and was best of the others while unable to menace the top one. SURPRISE ARRIVAL became edgy in the gate dislodging the rider before the
start, made no headway under a drive on the turn, and did enough to get up for the show on her left lead. ASTROMELIA broke on top but was wrangled
back, raced three then four wide continuing to lose ground to the leaders on the turn, and ran on one-paced for a share. G T'S BLUE SQUALL was
forwardly placed early inside, and faded through the drive. CLARIST set the early pace inside, got overhauled by the winner before completing three
furlongs, and retreated. WELLINGTONS ROSE was at the rear midway up the backstretch when she stumbled sharply, struck the rail and unseated the
rider, and was escorted off after being apprehended. NENITA threw her head to the left and refused at the break, and was ponied off. THERE WERE
STEWARDS INQUIRIES INTO THE START AND THE RUN UP THE BACKSTRETCH BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
AMADORA went along keyed up through the opening stages inside, moved around a retreating LOVIELEE settling down a bit up the backstretch, stayed
close hugging the rail on the far turn, came out to go after CENTSLESS DRAMA in midstretch and drove well clear. CENTSLESS DRAMA took control soon
after the start, rated along setting an even pace to the stretch, could not handle AMADORA leaving the furlong grounds, and saved the place. DANCE TILL
DAWN settled in the middle of the field for six furlongs, came three wide off the far turn, and rallied mildly to just get up outside for the show.
EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE prompted the pace outside CENTSLESS DRAMA from the outset, and lacked the needed late bid. SWEET STORY was outrun
early, advanced along the inside after six furlongs, but flattened out into the lane. NIGHT WATCH broke slowly, got floated out five wide into the backstretch
outside BAREBACK FUN, and never menaced. BAREBACK FUN checked inside shortly after the start, was keyed up and checked again midway on the
first turn, got taken out four wide floating out NIGHT WATCH into the backstretch, took closer order outside rivals after a half-mile, dropped back four wide
around the far turn, and drifted out being eased up late. LOVIELEE showed brief speed inside before retiring, swerved out to avoid a fallen rival approaching
the stretch, and was eased up. RUN DEVIL broke out, raced in midpack early, lunged awkwardly, struck the rail and unseated the rider past the
quarter-pole, and was escorted off after being apprehended. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT APPROACHING THE STRETCH
BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

TIZ ENOUGH pressed the early pace outside KATAMA MOONLIGHT and CONGRATSROSY, dropped off the leaders into the turn, continued outside
coming back on approaching the stretch, caught CONGRATSROSY from outside entering the final furlong and drove clear. CONGRATSROSY vied
between rivals early, gained the upper hand outside KATAMA MOONLIGHT in upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner past the eighth-pole
and settled for second best. TRANSGRESSION trailed in the two-path early, moved out for the drive and rallied belatedly. KATAMA MOONLIGHT vied
inside CONGRATSROSY for five furlongs, and gave way on the rail. PUPPET MASTER was finished early inside. SCAMPER ALONG retired after a
half-mile.

Footnotes
FRENCH QUARTER pressed NORTHERN from outside, poked a head in front past the quarter-pole, edged away leaving the furlong grounds, and was all
out to preserve the decision. CAJUN FIRECRACKER bumped with DR HARLAN after the start, raced three wide around the turn, rallied gamely outside the
winner late, then pulled up in distress and was vanned off. GAME BOY BENNY raced in the two-path on the turn, was in tight quarters on the rail battling
with NORTHERN late, and gamely got the show. NORTHERN set a pressured pace inside, got headed by the winner approaching the stretch, weakened in
the two-path and lost the show late. DR HARLAN bumped with CAJUN FIRECRACKER after the start, and was no factor two wide. PARTICULARITY was
outsprinted early, came three wide off the turn and made no impact. DARK AGES brushed the right side of the gate coming out, lacked room behind
FRENCH QUARTER and NORTHERN just after that, and was outrun four wide. WILD WIGGLIN JACK faded inside after three furlongs.

Footnotes
CORY GAL sprinted clear after the start, got shaken up for more in the two-path turning for home, wandered out until finally switching leads coming to the
sixteenth-pole, and had enough to hold on. BACCARAT FASHION was slow to begin after getting bumped by GREATER PLAN, advanced steadily three
wide midway on the turn, came a path wider into the stretch and rallied to be clearly second best. MY SARASOTA STAR was hemmed in behind the
pacesetter and inside OVER GATORS entering the turn, gained clearance between those two with aim approaching the top of the lane, but faded through
the final furlong. LAVI was outsprinted in the two-path for a half-mile, moved inside and was one-paced through the drive. WE THE CLOUDS was outrun
early inside, and made no headway on the far outside in the stretch. GREATER PLAN became edgy in the gate prior to the start, broke out bumping
BACCARAT FASHION, and was no factor other than that. OVER GATORS got bumped by ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA at the start, chased COZY GAL from
outside for a half, and faltered. ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA broke out into the hind end of OVER GATORS and steadied, dropped far back three wide around
the turn, and jogged in.

Footnotes
IMA COALMAN was unhurried early, moved to contention four wide after six furlongs, took over from outside with a sixteenth to go, and pulled clear.
POWER (BRZ) set the pace inside, got collared in deep stretch, and held well to stay clear of the others. ESTILO PELIGROSO moved up between horses
on the turn, was boxed in along the rail behind the leaders in upper stretch, had some room late but could not muster the needed final response. SWEET
GIANT broke out, prompted the pace for six furlongs, loomed in the three-path turning for home, but faded through the late stages. BELLAMY'S TREASURE
bumped with MOUNTAIN BREEZE at the start, raced wide, and made no headway through the lane on the far outside. MOUNTAIN BREEZE bumped with
BELLAMY'S TREASURE at the start, moved up three wide around the turn, and flattened out after six furlongs. IAMBUTTER was never prominent. GUN OF
GLORY showed some speed to the turn, and tired in the two-path. PERFECT ENOUGH saved ground into the turn, had the rider drop the whip a
quarter-mile out, and had no response. KING ANDRES shifted out five wide on the turn, and could not reach contention. FIRST SALVO broke slowly,
moved up inside entering the main track, and faded steadily after a half-mile. This race was hand timed.
