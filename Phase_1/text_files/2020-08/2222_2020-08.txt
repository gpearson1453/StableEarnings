STELLAR TRICK battled for the lead two wide into the stretch, gave up a narrow advantage, dug in determinedly through the final stages and got back up in
time. YURUBI contested the lead along the inside, led at the furlong marker and just missed hanging on despite a game effort. HASTY LADY vied for the
lead three wide and finished with good courage. SHYLA went evenly. MEET ME HALF WAY steadied when in tight along the rail shortly after the start then
failed to menace. FANCY PANTS reared at the start and trailed throughout. THE RIDER OF MEET ME HALF WAY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST
THE RIDER OF SHYLA FOR INTERFERENCE SOON AFTER THE START. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF
FINISH.

FOREST CHATTER broke in front, gave up the advantage soon thereafter, chased the pace while patiently handled, responded readily in the three path to
make the lead at the top of the lane then finished full of run to win going away under a strong hand ride. PRAIRIE CHIEF stalked the pace into the stretch,
had a mild late rally in the four path and finished clear for second. MADEYE sprinted up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, set the pace to the
top of the stretch then weakened. WILKO FREEWAY moved up three wide on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. REBEL ROAD well placed, had no
rally. GOT GRIT trailed.
