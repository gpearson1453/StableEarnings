Footnotes
SIMPLY RAVISHING forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, began to drift briefly near the three-eighths and had the rider apply a
stiff near side rein correction tucking back to be just off the inside, angled two to three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, took over command
straightened away and inched away under a drive kept to task. MRS FRANKEL (IRE) broke out a step at the start coming together with UYUNI who broke in
a step, grew a bit rank under restraint along the inside into the first turn before settling better once in hand, tracked the pace along the inside from in range,
came under lightly coaxed at the seven-sixteenths, tipped out with five-sixteenths to go to swing three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive shying
outwards near the sixteenth marker from a near sided stick and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. UYUNI broke in a step at the start
bumping lightly with MRS FRANKEL who broke out a step, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the
corner into upper stretch under challenge, got collared straightened away for home, dug in under a drive keeping on to the finish well clear of the rest for the
show honors. DELAWARE DESTINY three wide through the first turn, came inwards slightly appearing to want to lean on a rival and was taken under a hold
and corrected, grew rank six and a half furlongs from home before settling three wide down the backstretch in the clear, tucked two to three wide through
the far turn coming under light coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. BLEND broke in a step at the start
following UYUNI who did the same to her inside, tracked the pace from mid pack just off the inside, came under coaxing near the three-eighths tipped three
to four wide through the far turn, cornered four wide for home and tired. FEELING PRETTY brushed the near side stall at the start, tracked the pace along
the inside from near the rear, came under coaxing two to three wide at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
WALKOFF went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, ranged up in the two path early on the far turn, took the lead just inside the
three-eighths pole, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed whip in upper stretch, drifted out inside the furlong marker
with two foes in hot pursuit then switched to a left-handed whip, took a straight course from that point to the wire and held under strong urging. CURLIN
GREY went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along inside a foe while three wide on the far turn, came under a right-handed
whip at the five-sixteenths, was driven hard into upper stretch, switched to a left-handed whip at the three-sixteenths, chased inside of SHADOW RIDER
while behind the winner into the final furlong then dropped in and narrowly earned the place. SHADOW RIDER went four wide early on the first turn then
dropped to the two path, settled outside on the backstretch, was asked just inside the seven-sixteenths, went four wide under urging on the far turn, came
under a right-handed whip outside the quarter-pole, chased outside in the stretch and just missed the place while clear for the show. MILLS was taken in
hand while inside early on the first turn then moved to the two path, settled in third position down the backstretch, raced inside early on the far turn, was
roused outside the five-sixteenths then moved to the two path before being put to the whip, angled five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed
response. EDEN RIDGE was urged along early, saved ground on the first turn, lagged at the rear under some urging, went two then three wide on the far
turn, came under the whip in upper stretch and failed to threaten. HOROSCOPE was hustled to the lead, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first
turn, was well rated while setting an uncontested pace on an easy lead, came under urging while challenged by the winner outside the three-eighths then
lost the advantage just inside that marker, dropped back into the stretch and gave way. REAL DAN broke out and hit the gate but broke with the field, was
taken in hand behind a foe approaching the first turn, raced inside to the two path on that bend, settled into stride down the backstretch, was urged along in
mostly the two path on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
MR. ALEC away in good order, quickly established control, got set up along the inside route, proved able to be rated carving out the pace, accompanied by
TIDE OF THE SEA one path farther off the rail, remained on hold even as the aforementioned foe was asked to pick it up himself late on the third bend,
struck the three-sixteenths pole and only then was called upon for more, steadily extended the winning margin under good handling. TIDE OF THE SEA
attended the winner from the two path, got roused heading home, proved no match. BLUEGRASS PARKWAY made it over to the rail shortly after the start,
remained on it well rated, tipped into path two coming up to the last turn, came under stronger handling a furlong later, stepped into the lane, got outfinished.
AFRICAN HERITAGE spotted along the rail on the first turn, inched its way into path two proceeding along the stretch for the first time, ventured onward two
wide until the quarter pole, took a three wide stroll entering the stretch, secured the final significant slice of the purse despite being only lightly urged.
CHANNEL ISLAND failed to fire after undergoing a trip covering ground between the inside route and the two path. SHORE MAGIC saved ground to no
avail.

came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. BIELEFELD chased three to four
wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on for the last major share. J P'S SONG dueled from the two path with

IAN GLASS broke very alertly then was taken in hand while in front early, showed the way while well rated near the inside, responded well when asked
coming to the quarter-pole then was put to a right-handed whip into the stretch, extended the advantage into the final furlong, switched to a left-handed whip
near the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. MEGACITY was asked some leaving the gate then taken under a strong hold nearing the first turn,
saved ground on that bend, was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the rail on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, moved off the rail
then was put to a left-handed whip in upper stretch, swapped back to his inside lead while switched to a right-handed whip at the furlong marker, went back
to a left-handed whip while pursuing the winner into the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the place. BAD GUY was asked leaving the gate, saved
ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused with three furlongs to run, went three then four wide under urging on the far turn, came under a
right-handed whip at the five-sixteenths, was driven hard into upper stretch and lacked the needed response while just able to get the show. CORAL
LEGACY saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear of the field, raced inside on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, turned into the
stretch in the two path while under the whip and just missed the show. WAR FILM broke out and a bit awkwardly while last to commence, rounded the first
turn in the two path, settled on the outside, started the far turn in the two path then shifted four wide while roused, dropped back to three wide outside the
quarter-pole, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to rally. UNLEVERAGED brushed with a foe at the start, traveled around the first turn in the
two path, stalked the pace on the outside, raced in the two path on the far turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive into upper stretch and
came up empty. IMPAZIBLE ODDS was washy during the warm-up, brushed with a rival at the start, was taken under a tight hold early, went around the
first turn in the two path, was reserved under restraint on the outside, came under urging in the three path on the far turn, floated six wide into the stretch
and had nothing left. (Rail at 18 Feet)

Footnotes
LADY LILLY With the majority being urged along in varying degrees springing from the starting, LADY LILLY established the top, gradually made her way
over to the rail, getting there by the conclusion of the backstretch, showed the way, hand urged and facing pressure from a pair of opponents parked out in
two and three respectively, was the first of that threesome to get set down, this occurring just shy of the quarter pole, kicked away to her largest advantage
during the ensuing furlong, came under heavy pressure soon afterwards, dug in with determination to preserve the decision. MO DEAN along the outside
early, slid onto the inside route, at the half mile pole, becoming the fourth in line along it, abandoned it in order to steer by a tiring rival a furlong later,
remained towards the two path the rest of the way to the quarter pole, swung out wider and wider after having stepped into the stretch until in the
neighborhood of path seven by midlane, had a good finish down the outside of the strip, missed. SPUN D'ETAT secured the pocket after the field had been
sent on its way, kept watch as the front runners went at it during the run around the bend, was let out a notch going by the five-sixteenths marker, made it
into the stretch, inched her way into the two path, attaining the goal deep into the furlong grounds, narrowed in on the one to catch, came up short. MALIBU
LUNA took up position in midpack racing along the backstretch, departed it from the three path, got sent out five wide for the drive, made little headway in
the final furlong. BEAUTIFUL FAREWELL chased the pace from path two in midpack, angled four wide into the stretch, idled behind a wall of equines,
tipped out wider, procuring racing clearance at the start of the last eighth, saw the pilot resort to a vigorous ride, failed to respond appreciably, completed the
final stages somewhat geared down. MALIBU CURL travelled two to three wide on the turn, got maneuvered into the eight path during the first half of the
stretch run, appeared to mainly improve position thereafter. RIGHT TO FREEDOM stationed in the two path, disputed the pace from between rivals from the
half mile pole to upper stretch, gave way,. MY ALLURING LADY lost her footing after coming in with her initial step, got going and attained a prominent
position, contended for the lead as the outermost of three from path three from the top of the bend until approaching the furlong grounds, got pinched in the
general area of the eighth pole while in the first stages of backing away. MISS MORGANTOWN fractious onto the track, left the post parade and her pony,
then went on her way to a long gallop, proceeded to break tardily, began to climb several jumps later in addition to reaching out greenly, tucked along the
rail, rode it to the quarter pole, was moved into the two path at the head of the stretch, never made her presence felt. NEEDACARCALLLOUIE faded off a
ground-saving journey.

came under a vigorous hand ride, the rider keeping his whip under his right forearm and inched away to the finish to prevail. DOWSE'S BEACH coaxed from
the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the
place honors. KITTEN'S CAT three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn, got let out spinning two to three wide for home and
ran on to secure the show honors. DUNCASTLE coaxed from the gate, showed the way lightly coaxed along the inside, cut the corner into upper stretch
under threat, dug in and was headed a furlong out, weakened in the late stages. FIELD OF COURAGE chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung two to three wide for home and improved position by tired foes. DISCRETIONARY MARQ hustled from the start, chased four wide until
tucked to the two path through the turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and made no late headway. BANANA THIEF

Footnotes
FORT WORTH was coaxed along on the outside, came under stronger encouragement in the four path on the turn, gained into the stretch, took the lead at
the three-sixteenths, inched away under a left-handed whip into the final furlong then drifted out a couple paths, remained under the whip to the
sixteenth-pole then was placed under a solid hand ride before being eased up in the final five strides while best. GANDY DANCING bumped with a rival at
the start, settled off the early pace, was taken under tight restraint midway down the backstretch then became rank under a vigorous hold, leveled back out
some inside the half-mile pole, came between horses at the seven-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, swung five
wide into the stretch, made an outside bid under a strong hand ride at the three-sixteenths, was put to a right-handed whip nearing the furlong marker and
was outfinished but held the place. HARRIS BAY broke out then bumped with a rival then was carried in and taken up at the rear, settled at the back, moved
in near the nine-sixteenths, went three wide for most of the turn while guided with a bit of extra left rein pressure, swung six wide into the stretch under the
whip, moved into a good striking position on the outside under a drive into the final furlong but flattened out and settled for the show. LEAP TO GLORY
bumped with a rival at the start then came inward, stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive, pursued the winner into the final furlong and tired. QUINTARELLI was urged along on the inside, dropped back along the rail on the turn, moved to the
two path inside the five-sixteenths then was put to the whip outside the quarter-pole, came three wide into the stretch under a drive and capitulated.
WUSHU WARRIOR bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, raced between horses in the two path into the turn, was roused while dropping
closer to the rail at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the whip and came up empty. MIDNIGHT WHISKEY bumped with a rival at the start,
was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and failed to respond. RIKEN was hustled to the lead and set the pace, vied inside on the turn,
was asked at the five-sixteenths, came under the whip after straightening for the drive, lost the advantage to the winner at the three-sixteenths and faded.
MOONACHIE bobbled very awkwardly at the start, was immediately wrapped up and pulled up out of the race then subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
MORETTI took up residence in the three path after the start, was well reserved, as were all the others, as the field filed their way across the finish line the
first time, got let out a notch leaving the clubhouse bend, inched up from the crown of the backstretch to its end, got set down springing from the half mile
pole, overhauled EXPERT after going by the three-eighths pole and shifted over into a tight fit in path two, spun into the lane with ROCKETRY looming
boldly, turned back the stiff challenge that followed from the previously- foe and edged clear. YOU'RE TO BLAME well rated talking the inside route all the
way to the half mile pole, got called upon to pick it up at that station, angled four wide spinning into the stretch, was induced by EXPERT to go into the five
path in midstretch, rallied with late foot to get up for the place. ROCKETRY loped along in the two path until the end of the second turn, tipped out and after
briefly riding another's cover, was steered into the path four, was still in it unleashing a menacing run around the last turn, followed MORETTI and moved
closer to the rail right around the five-sixteenths marker, turned into the lane poised to strike, arrived at the three-sixteenths pole and got turned loose, was
staved off by an opponent equal to the task at hand, weakened in the last few strides and lost the place. EXPERT attended AMERICAN TATTOO from path,
moved when ready at the half mile pole, grabbed away the advantage and slid over to the rail, was himself overhauled a short distance down the road, got
driven three wide into the lane, shied out into path four weakening in midlane, had no trouble salvaging the last major check. AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG)
glided over to the rail with the advantage shortly after stepping onto the first of three turns, showed the way, well rated and with an equally well-rated
EXPERT in accompaniment from the outside, got displaced by that one in the general area of the half mile pole, retreated to the back of the pack, then was
taken hold of and allowed to fade away down the lane.

Footnotes
BUONA FINA came under coaxing to be forwardly placed between foes in the two path into the opening bend, then eased off as DOUBLE ADVANTAGE
was intent on the front, chased three then two wide, advanced on the leader and took over command placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner
into upper stretch, drifted out straightened away under threat, dug in to repel the challenge holding sway in the battle of attrition gamely to the wire. HEIGHT
three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home, drifted out straightened
away and dug in fighting on to the finish latched on the aforementioned foe but could not go by while clear of the rest for the place honors. KICKIN' KIRBY
chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three wide for home, tipped out as HEIGHT drifted in front, dug in under a drive
and weakened in the late stages while clear for the show honors. TACTICIAN broke out a step at the start and was taken off BUONA FINA, chased just off
the inside until tipped three to four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered four wide for home and weakened. BUBBA
CHUCK two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. DOUBLE
ADVANTAGE coaxed from the start, raced three wide into the first turn taking over command and tucking to the two path, showed the way in hand just off
the inside, came under pressure into the far turn and was placed to coaxing near the three-eighths, got displaced from the front at that station and was
ridden along through the latter portion of the bend in retreat, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. JOHN WANT REVENGE chased just off the
inside at the tail of the field growing detached from the main body, tucked inside at the half mile pole, was well behind just off the inside into upper stretch
and was eased through to the wire while trailing throughout.
