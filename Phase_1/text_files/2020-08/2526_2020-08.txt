Footnotes
ROCKET RELOAD took over the lead early, set a pressured pace, dueled from the rail late turn, shook clear into the stretch and held sway under a hand
ride. NERO DAVOLA broke sharply but was quickly headed, forced the pace, dueled two-wide late turn, chased into the stretch but was unable to gain on
the leader. SILENT GUROO stalked the pace, rode the rail on the turn and chased through the stretch. MATTHAUS ducked out and was steadied at the
start, settled off the pace, angled from three-wide to the rail past mid turn and finished gamely but to no avail. SOX AND SANDALS settled in mid pack, was
hustled three and four-wide on the turn then failed to menace in the stretch. QUEEN RHONDA raced in mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide through
the turn, chased into the stretch but did not threaten. ERASMO'S GIRL broke outward and settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn but never reached
contention. JILL, bothered by NAUGHTY MABEL leaving the gate, settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then lacked a closing
response. NAUGHTY MABEL broke inward, raced in mid pack, came two and three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch then flattened out in the
final furlong. BURLAP settled off the pace, trailed the field and was never in contention. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER ON NERO DAVOLA
AGAINST ROCKET RELOAD FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
BEN LOMOND nestled in to sit a perfect trip behind the leaders until upper stretch, angled out in upper stretch with the rider having designs to come outside
the dueling front runners, then went to plan B when one of the two in front drifted out, splitting the pair and leading at the sixteenth pole, holding safe while
driving late. KID'S MISCHIEF trailed into the far turn before commencing a solid run, two path to rail in late stretch, but ran out of real estate, closing best of
all but falling short of the winner. TALE OF THE NILE chased the leaders in the two path while outside the winner on the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch
to bid but could only go by the two pacesetters, unable to match the late energy of the top pair. COURT BATTLE stalked the early leader, pressed that rival
on the far turn and assumed command while hard ridden in upper stretch but couldn't sustain it and lost positions in the final sixteenth, game for a minor
award. DOT'S VISION settled in mid pack while three to two wide on the first turn, rallied two to four wide on the far turn and was fanned out widest turning
for home, his rally stalling in the final sixteenth. SHEER FLATTERY was off the pace and along the inside into the far turn, closed up nicely when roused but
seemed to stall in upper stretch, shifted out at the sixteenth pole and became re-invigorated, closing best of the rest late while outside. BLACK SEA (FR)
was in mid pack early along the inside, angled out to the three path turning for home and in range but levelled off in the final sixteenth. TALE OF VIENNA
was hard ridden to the front early, stalked and pressed by a rival all the way, lost the lead by the eighth pole in the stretch, falling back from that point.
SEVENTYSEVEN STONE was herded in at the start and off the pace four to two wide on the first turn, still near the rear three to five wide on the far turn,
never in contention. OUR ZUMA broke in at the start, was three to six wide moving up to stalk on the first turn, drifted out three to six wide while dropping
back on the far turn, very wide at the top of the stretch, wilting in the stretch.

Footnotes
BIG BIG PLANS bumped with MARTINA'S GALS leaving the gate, stalked the pace from the rail, chased two-wide into the stretch, led quickly and drew
away under a hand ride. WELL YOU STARTEDIT dueled on the backstretch, gained a short lead into the turn, set a pressured pace, had command at the
top of the stretch but was headed, then chased gamely and held place. SLASHS RED DIAMOND hopped at the start, raced in mid pack, came along the rail
and two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. GLINDA GOOD WITCH broke inward and settled off the pace, closed angling
from the rail to three-wide late turn and finished under a determined drive. DANCING ZAZINGA, in range early, was hustled two-wide on the turn then
finished evenly. CIGARILLO settled off the pace, came two-wide through the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch but never reached contention.
MARTINA'S GALS, bumped at the start, dueled, forced the pace on the turn, chased into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. DANCING NOTE
raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but lacked a rally. TARA EMPIRE broke outward and settled off the pace, came four to
six-wide through the turn but lacked a closing response. DOWN TO EARTH dueled early, pressed the pace into the turn, was hustled three and four-wide
then flattened out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MIND THE GAP, always in striking range, stalked from late backstretch, saved ground on the turn then chased two-wide into the stretch but was block at the
top of the straightaway, ducked in and quickly took control and widened under a hand ride. ENGLISH CLASSIC set a pressured pace, shook clear upper
stretch, was engaged quickly and was no match but held on for the place position. BUY ME CANDY hit the gate leaving, settled in mid pack, closed
four-wide late turn and was all out through the stretch. INSIDER TRADING stalked the pace, was hustled late on the far turn, launched a determined drive
but evened out in the late stages. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION settled well back early, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn, raced widest through the
stretch then evened out late. SELF INFLICTED raced in mid pack, was blocked at the top of the stretch then flattened out in the final 16th. DEEP FREEZE
forced the pace, came two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, was steadied behind the leader then flattened out after a brief chase. SAMARIAN,
close early, stalked late backstretch, came two and three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and tired. ROCKET PLAN, rated off the pace, was
hustled from the rail and two-wide on the final turn but never reached contention.

Footnotes
SWEET SHADES broke outward and bumped NATURAL HABITAT, stalked the pace, closed late on the far turn, bid upper stretch and drove clear. CALL
HER JOEY got away slowly and let NATURAL HABITAT take a bumping for her and she settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide late on the
far turn the chased gamely through the stretch. CAPABLE stalked early then forced the pace late backstretch, had the lead early turn but yielded in the final
furlong. NATURAL HABITAT bumped with CALL HER JOEY at the outset, stalked the pace, was fanned five-wide entering the clubhouse turn, remained in
striking range, chased four-wide on the far turn then evened out in the stretch. QUEEN ANDHER COURT broke inward and settled off the pace, was hustled
three to five-wide on the far turn and finished all out. PASTEL EMILY was pinched back at the start then was fanned seven-wide entering the first turn,
settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn then evened out in the stretch. WILLED broke outward and settled off the pace, was
hustled moving from two-wide to the rail on the far turn but never reached contention. BOSCOBEL dueled on the clubhouse turn after inheriting the lead
from LAXMI, but the battlers were headed early on the far turn. BOSCOBEL chased to the stretch and tired a 16th out. FRIDAY NIGHT MAGIC dueled, was
headed early on the far turn and backed away. LAXMI broke outward, showed speed, drifted out entering the first turn, stalked the new leaders but faded on
the far turn. MISS EVANGELINE was pinched back at the start, settled in mid pack, raced along the rail and two-wide on the far turn, fell at the top of the
stretch and walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE SPILL INVOLVING MISS EVANGELINE LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED. A CLAIM OF
FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER ON FRIDAY NIGHT MAGIC AGAINST CAPABLE FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE FAR TURN WAS DISALLOWED, AS
WAS A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE TRAINER OF NATURAL HABITAT AGAINST CAPABLE FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE FAR TURN.
