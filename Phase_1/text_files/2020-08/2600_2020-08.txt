Footnotes
DOX FOLLY stalked the leading pace setters from the three path around the first turn, made a three wide bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, then
dueled outside of the inner game pace setter through midstretch before inching clear passing the sixteenth pole. FAITHFUL NEIGHBOR set the pace along
the inside, held an advantage from a pair of foes around the far turn, dug in inside of DOX FOLLY turning for home, dueled gamely inside of that foe through
the lane, but was bested by her at the sixteenth pole. PEGASUS ON THE GO was washed out pre-race, prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep
pace with rivals on both sides passing the quarter pole, then held show through the lane. ROCKY RUSH came under a drive passing the half mile pole to
chase the trio of leaders from the inside into the far turn, but failed sustain her bid and did not threaten. MEMPHISINMAY took the far turn in the four path,
and failed to factor. UNBRIDLED BOILER broke outwards, bumped a foe, and was uncontrollable at the start, then saved ground far off of the pace
throughout and never got involved. Due to a timer malfunction, the quarter mile, half mile, and three-quarter mile times were omitted.

Footnotes
PORTOBELLO'S HERO quickly cleared the field, held a clear margin around the far turn before meeting a challenge from ITS JUST FATE at the quarter
pole, swiftly repelled that foe in upper stretch and drew off, then held under driving pressure. STILL CHIEF stalked along the inside around the turn, shifted
three wide in upper stretch with multiple lengths to find, then sustained a rally on his left lead through the final furlong, but ran out of ground. ITS JUST
FATE chased the loose leader two wide, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but was repelled in upper stretch, and subsequently weakened. CONQUEST
STORMY trailed in the four to six path around the turn, then passed tired foes for a minor reward. PLEASANT SUNRISE hopped a bit at the start, took the
turn in the three to five path while far off of the pace, and failed to factor. OUR BALDY B tracked from midpack four to three wide, but came under a drive at
the seven sixteenths pole, and weakened around the turn. SECRET INTEREST saved ground off of the pace, but was not a factor. Due to a timer
malfunction, no fractional times are available and the final time was Hand-Timed.

Footnotes
SOUL STREIT quickly cleared, held a margin around the far turn, then responded readily when asked in upper stretch, kicked clear, then won under wraps.
CASH FOR GOLD tracked from midpack in the four path around the turn, commenced a rally at the five sixteenths pole, and sustained that bid to get up for
place approaching the wire while proving no match for the leader. TWOBIRDSONESTONE trailed in the four to six path around the turn, and rallied
belatedly for show. CAP DE FUEGO stalked the leader from the two path, but proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, and tired. RAMPAGE stalked
the leader from the three path, but weakened in upper stretch. WICKED SLIDER tracked from midpack in the two path around the turn, and failed to factor.
FLATOUTJUSTICE saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail.

Footnotes
HUNGARIAN PRINCESS commenced a three wide rally from midpack into the turn, produced a bid for the lead approaching the quarter pole, forged an
advantage turning for home, drew off approaching the furlong pole, and was ridden out to the wire. AMAZING GAL stalked two wide, bid for the lead
between horses at the quarter pole as HUNGARIAN PRINCESS rallied along side, but proved no match for that foe approaching the furlong pole, then held
place from the rallying DIAMOND SOLITAIRE at the wire. DIAMOND SOLITAIRE was off a step slowly and trailed the field, rallied in the four to five path
around the turn, then willingly sustained that progress through the lane, but ran out of ground for place. MISS FORT shifted from the five to the three path
into the turn while far off of the pace, then stayed on mildly between tiring foes through the lane for a minor reward. PEARL TIARA hopped at the start and
tracked the pace two wide, then shifted to the four path turning for home, but failed to factor. MISS DEVIOUS advanced four wide to midpack into the turn,
but failed to achieve striking position before weakening on her left lead through the lane. CECILIA'S HOPE cleared early on, but was pressed by a pair of
foes around the turn, was headed turning for home, and gave way in upper stretch. EYE FLIRT stalked along the inside, but weakened at the three furlong
pole and faded thereafter. SHEZA SUNRISE was outrun along the inside and showed little.

Footnotes
CECILE'S CHAPTER was forwardly placed along the inside, glided to the three path approaching the five sixteenths pole to produce a three wide bid for the
lead at the quarter pole, drifted to the five path turning for home, but straightened, kicked clear passing the furlong pole, and was wrapped up approaching
the wire. INCESSANT vied along the inside before dueling for the lead down the backstretch, dug in turning for home as CECILE'S CHAPTER made a bid,
but proved no match for that foe passing the furlong pole, then weakened, but just held place at the wire. GO BIG GREEN saved ground far off the pace
around the first turn, advanced three wide around the far turn, shifted to the five path in midstretch and sustained her rally through the late stages, but
missed place at the wire. YOUENS was off slowly, raced far off of the pace two wide around the first turn, advanced four wide around the far turn, the stayed
on through the lane, but was outfinished for minor rewards. SEAWARD raced off of the pace three wide around the first turn before advancing to midpack
into the far turn, saved ground around that bend, but failed to sustain her progress and failed to menace. PRINCESS DYNASTY set the pace two wide early
on, dueled with her inner foe down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace between horses in upper stretch. PUNCTUAL was a bit crowded at the start,
saved ground far off of the pace around the first turn, commenced a four wide rally passing the nine sixteenths, but flattened out after drifting to the six path
turning for home, then weakened. FIGHTING ZELDA saved ground off of the pace, but was shuffled behind a tiring foe from the three furlong pole to the five
sixteenths pole, shifted three wide turning for home, but lacked a rally. COUGER stalked the pace four to three wide around the first turn, inched closer to
prompt the pace three wide at the half mile pole, but weakened at the three furlong pole and faded. CALL OF LOVE lagged behind the field around both
turns, then passed tired foes through the lane. PRIZED CUPCAKE tracked from midpack two wide, but was shuffled back to far off of the pace into the far
turn, then failed to make an impact. BROOKLYNS A GINGER was forwardly placed three to two wide, but weakened at the seven sixteenths pole, faded
approaching the three furlong pole causing multiple foes to be shuffled back, and was eased through the lane. Due to a timer malfunction, the six furlong
time was omitted.

UNCLE KICK was forwardly placed along the inside, stalked the trio of leaders from right off of the pace around the far turn, tipped to the four path passing
the five sixteenths pole to produce a four wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole, dueled with WHOLELOTACHOCOLATE under along drive through
midstretch, but kicked clear of that foe at the sixteenth pole. WHOLELOTACHOCOLATE broke outwards impeding WEST SIDER, stalked the pace two wide
and between horses, bid for the lead two wide into the far turn, vied between horses around the far turn, dug in gamely in upper stretch as UNCLE KICK
sustained a bid, but was bested by that foe at the sixteenth pole. WEST SIDER shied out at the start, was caught four wide off of the pace around the first
turn, advanced to stalking position down the backstretch before producing a three wide bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, vied outside a pair of rivals
around the far turn, but failed to keep pace between horses in upper stretch. CZECHMIGHT set the pace along the inside, but was headed by a trio of foes
passing the quarter pole, and weakened. COMFORT ME NOW tracked from midpack three wide and between horses, but failed to factor. LIFE ON THE
ROAD had a slow start, trailed throughout, and was outrun.

Footnotes
TIMELESS ROSE was rank through the stretch for the first turn, settled off of the pace along the inside, rallied four wide into and around the far turn, forged
an advantage passing the quarter pole, but drifted in multiple paths straightening into the lane, caused KANFU to steady in upper stretch despite being clear
of that rival, and drew off thereafter. EMILY LANE stalked the pace in the three to two path around the first turns, then cleared an inner rival and stalked
from the pocket around the far turn, but was outmoved by the eventual winner turning for home, shifted two wide in upper stretch while proving no match for
that foe, and stayed on to prove second best. NUTCRACKER BALLET tracked from midpack in the three path, pursued the pace three wide in striking range
down the backstretch, but was outmoved by the eventual winner at the five sixteenths pole, then kept on through the lane to wear down an inner foe for
show. KANFU held a clear margin down the backstretch, but was headed by the surging eventual winner turning for home, steadied as that foe cleared off
and drifted in in upper stretch, then tired through the late stages and was nailed on the wire for show. HAWAIIAN MEMORIES advanced from far off of the
pace in the three path into the turn, steadily shifted to the five path around that bend, but leveled off and failed to achieve a minor reward. TEENER stalked
the pace two wide, but weakened between rivals around the far turn, and was eased through the lane. SAVEDBESTFORLAST was forwardly placed along
the inside, but weakened at the three furlong pole. TWILIGHT MAGIC was bumped after the start, trailed the field by a distance around both turns, then
passed tired foes. WISHED raced off of the pace in the four to five path around the turns, and was not a factor. VIOLANE saved ground from midpack, but
weakened into the far turn, was done early, and eased through the final furlong. Following a Stewards' inquiry into the stretch run of KANFU, TIMELESS
ROSE and EMILY LANE, no action was taken.

MARQUEE THUNDER set the pace along the inside with his ears pricked through the lane for the first turn, held an advantage around both turns before
shaking loose from a pressing foe in upper stretch, then drew off and held under driving pressure. PIP'S BRASSY BOY saved ground off of the pace around
the first turn, steadily advanced two wide down the backstretch, split foes at the quarter pole, forged show while shifting three wide turning for home, then
rallied through the lane to just get up for place at the wire. SIT TIGHT saved ground while stalking the pace, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper
stretch, then kept on to forge place from an outer foe at the furlong pole, but was nailed on the wire for that position. IT'S MANDATORY rushed through the
lane for the first time to stalk the pace three wide, but was floated four wide in upper stretch, then got outfinished for minor rewards. ROUNDER was
forwardly placed two wide and between horses, but weakened into the far turn, refound stride in upper stretch, then came again but failed to achieve a minor
reward. DETECTIVE rallied from far off of the pace inside of foes around the far turn altered course to the six path approaching the furlong, pole, but leveled
off on his left lead. HARD NIGHT prompted the pace setter two wide, but failed to keep pace with that rival in upper stretch, then weakened through the final
furlong. SIGNSOFAWARRIOR tracked from midpack in the three to four path around the turns, but weakened. ATLAS MOON bumped with an inner foe at
the start, got keen in the three path around the first turn while far off of the pace, then took the far turn in the five path, and failed to factor. AWESOME
