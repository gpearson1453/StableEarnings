Footnotes
MONORAIL steadied along keyed up between horses leaving the first turn, moved swiftly to contention four wide on the far turn, outdueled CRYSTAL
COAST taking over and pulling clear past the eighth-pole, then staved off YAFA to the wire. YAFA saved ground close up for six furlongs, maneuvered out
three wide off the far turn, bid late outside MONORAIL but did not have quite enough. CRYSTAL COAST was strung out five wide into the first turn, grabbed
the lead outside PRETZEL and IRIS THE EMPRESS approaching the head of the stretch, fought inside MONORAIL to the furlong grounds and weakened
from there. MARVELOUS MARLENE bumped with ZAP MAMA at the start, saved ground well back early, advanced four wide after six furlongs, but could
not sustain the rally. LOVE IN HER EYES dropped over inside entering the first turn, moved out in upper stretch and lacked a solid response. LAZY
SUMMER DAY hesitated at the start spotting the field two or three lengths, went four then five wide on the far turn at the back, and improved past tired
horses. PRETZEL set the pace inside, and gave way after six furlongs. ZAP MAMA bumped with MARVELOUS MARLENE at the start, and was outrun
three wide. INDY FRONT was finished after a half-mile three wide. MARYMOTHEROF JESUS raced three to four wide, and was outrun. IRIS THE
EMPRESS went four wide chasing after PRETZEL into the first turn, and faltered after six furlongs. AIR CAVALRY was three wide early, and tired before
reaching the stretch.

MORE THAN USUAL took the lead early, rated along slightly off the rail to the stretch, drifted out while well clear entering the final furlong and faced no
dangers. SUPERHIGHWAY chased inside early, came under a ride five-sixteenths out, could not menace the winner but edged clear for the place with an
even finish. EL ZEUS pursued the pacesetter three then two wide, and was outfinished for second while much best of the remainder. RUSSIAN WINE
chased the winner early, and gave way between horses midway on the turn. BELLAS FELLA bumped with JANUARY WON at the start, and was no factor
three wide. COMING UP ROSES tired in the two-path before reaching the stretch. JANUARY WON was urged early and often, and offered nothing. Due to
a timer malfunction all times have been omitted.

JUST KIDDING vied outside PATRICULARITY early, cleared off after a half-mile, responded to pressure widening on DEXTER ROAD through mid stretch,
and coasted in the last 70 yards. DEXTER ROAD tracked three wide, moved up getting closest to JUST KIDDING after five furlongs, and gave futile chase
the rest of the way much best of the others. TAKEDOWN raced two to three wide to the end of the turn, shifted out a bit wider for the drive and had no rally.
PARTICULARITY vied inside JUST KIDDING up the backstretch, could not keep pace into the turn, and tired. SHIDOSHI faded early three wide. CHARGE
CARD saved ground and retired after a half. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, NO TIMES ARE AVAILABLE.

Footnotes
R MAN JOE vied outside DISCREET TUNE and WEEKEND DREAMER early, took over at the top of the stretch kicking away, and drifted out late while
clear. BLOODPROF saved ground into the turn, came two wide rallying into the lane, and finished willingly inside to take the place battle. LASCARI (GB)
was a step slow at the start, shifted out five wide approaching the stretch, and rallied outside just missing second. DON V. stayed in range three then four
wide to the head of the lane, and lacked a solid closing bid. JOE BENJAMIN saved ground on the turn, moved out a bit and gained mildly without
threatening. DISCREET TUNE vied inside rivals early, and was outpaced through the latter part of the turn. PRO QUALITY walked out of the gate four to
five lengths behind the others, and was always outrun. WEEKEND DREAMER argued the early pace between rivals, yielded to the winner turning for home,
and retreated.

Footnotes
MARCELINO moved off the inside to the two-path approaching the quarter-pole, shifted further out rallying through mid stretch, overtook the dueling leaders
from outside 70 yards out, and held off last-ditch bids from both flanks to the wire. GRAN MALBEC saved ground outrun early, moved out through upper
stretch, and finished strongly outside the winner. FAMOUS FACT lagged far back to the stretch, stayed on the rail kicking in past the eighth-pole, finished
strongly but ran out of real estate. BLACK JET was sent hard from the gate, dueled outside STURGEON to deep stretch, and was overrun from both sides.
STURGEON was sent hard from the gate, dueled inside BLACK JET through swift fractions to deep stretch, and was overrun from both sides. FUZZY IRISH
RASCAL settled in the middle of the field early, and made no impact. DIAMOND MINT was well placed off the dueling leaders around the turn, but could not
capitalize and weakened. PURE LUCK was leaning on the right side of the stall at the break, came out two or three lengths behind the next-to-last horse,
was well out of it to the lane, and gained some ground on the far outside. TIZ APPROVED raced three wide to the stretch, and tired. BLAZING DESIRE was
outrun four wide. CHIEF WHITE SOX was through early. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA was always far back.

Footnotes
DAUNTLESS GAL saved ground into the turn with the dueling leaders in view, moved out three wide beginning to pick them up after a half-mile, took over
from outside in upper stretch and drove clear all out. RESTOFTHESTORY dueled outside HIGHLAND MOON from the outset, got the best of that dispute as
the winner rolled by a furlong out, and fought on gamely. VILLAGE QUEEN was outsprinted early, came four wide off the turn, lugged in approaching the
eighth-pole, straightened out and was going well to the finish. HIGHLAND MOON was in a bit tight contesting the early pace inside RESTOFTHESTOORY,
and weakened in upper stretch. TEQUA faded after a half-mile. LOVIN LIVIN broke slowly and was outrun throughout. ALEXANDRA AM I lost her footing
and veered out greenly at the start, raced wide and dropped far back approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
SIR SEAMUS tugged along with a sizeable early lead, got shaken up through upper stretch still well in command, began to labor in deep stretch and just
lasted inside two challengers. TIL THE END was outrun early inside, remained well back after six furlongs in the three-path, moved out wider rallying
through the furlong grounds, and just missed outside rivals. RHYTHMIA was a step slow at the start, raced well back for a half-mile, took closer order
around the far turn three wide, bid between SIR SEAMUS and TIL THE END through the late stages and came up a bit short. HERO OF THE HOUR stayed
in range early, was roused inside midway on the far turn, and lacked a solid closing response. R MERCEDES BOY gave chase outside the winner for six
furlongs, and tired. MONY lagged well back for six furlongs, steadied lacking room on the rail at the top of the stretch, and was empty when clear.
UNLOCKTHEPOTENTIAL was slow to begin, and made no impact. DAKOTA'S DUDE raced in the two-path, and tired after six furlongs.

Footnotes
RODEO RED was forwardly placed from the start between horses, came three wide into the stretch, stayed on task remaining on his left lead, and overtook
NIMBLE BEAST from outside late. SEMPER FI went along covered up behind and between horses in midpack for a half-mile, had the four-path turning for
home, and was just up at the wire for second. NIMBLE BEAST saved ground in striking range to the end of the turn, came out to the two-path taking aim at
CHILL HAZE, wrested command entering the final furlong, but could not hold on. SINISTER broke a step slow and was in the second flight for a half-mile
inside, moved out in the stretch and responded mildly to land a share. TAPI FROST was no factor four then five wide on the turn. EXCALIBUR raced just off
the early leaders outside, and faded through the lane. WINTER AT BASTOGNE was always outrun. CHILL HAZE set the pace inside to the stretch, stayed
on his left lead and shortened stride through the last furlong. TRINNI JOHN faded into the stretch six wide.

Footnotes
LUCKY POLLY chased BLUE MISTRESS from afar through the opening half-mile, closed in from outside around the far turn, stayed on determinedly
through a long drive and got up in the last strides. BLUE MISTRESS broke to the lead, built a sizeable advantage through an even early pace, got roused
outside the quarter-pole as challenges materialized from both flanks, dug in while drifting out and then in through the lane, and just failed to last.
TOURNESOL was allowed to settle early, moved menacingly along the rail around the far turn, had ample room inside through the lane, but hung through
the final stages. R CALLI KIM raced two to three wide in the second flight to the stretch, and gained mildly without threatening. YESTERDAYONCEMORE
(IRE) saved ground for six furlongs, came two or three paths off the rail in upper stretch, and had no rally. FUJAIRAH raced three wide, put in a brief bid
outside the leaders a quarter-mile out, but faded through the drive. BANKRUPTONTHEBEACH broke slowest and was far back for a half, made up some
ground on the far turn three then four wide, angled in through upper stretch and made no headway.

Footnotes
MARKISTAN was never far back, moved to contention three wide after a half-mile, bid between ITSMYLUCKYGIRL and ABARRIO FOREVER through deep
stretch and edged away. ABARRIO FOREVER took closer order after a half, swung four wide with aim at the leaders turning for home, loomed outside late,
but came up second best. ITSMYLUCKYGIRL vied outside MYSTIC COMIN HOME early, disposed of that one and moved in leaving the backstretch, faced
pressure from LUXE DIAMOND around the turn, got the best of that dispute and was confronted by MARKISTAN right after that, drifted out past the furlong
marker and yielded late. SOCIALLY ASTRAY hit the left side of the gate at the start, shifted out five wide in the second flight approaching the lane, and did
enough to pick up a share. LUXE DIAMOND pressed the pace three then two wide around the turn, and gave way in the stretch. LEMONCITA was no factor
three wide. ROSALDA got bumped by GIOIELLI and checked after the start, and was never close. GIOIELLI hit the right side of the gate and bumped
GRAN BRANDY coming out, then got pushed in and was sawed off and checked between the latter and ROSALDA, and was outrun. GRAN BRANDY got
bumped by GIOIELLI at the break, then came in pushing that one into ROSALDA, and was never in contention. MYSTIC COMIN HOME vied early inside
ITSMYLUCKYGIRL, could not match strides into the turn, and faltered through the drive.

Footnotes
GIVEMETWENTY was well situated off the dueling leaders, closed in three wide on the far turn, challenged outside MONFORTE while attempting to lug in
through upper stretch, dueled with the rider tugging hard on the right rein, and edged clear late. MONFORTE stayed well out in the course contesting the
pace with GRACEFUL KITTEN around the first turn, moved in up the backstretch, gained command approaching the quarter-pole, faced a challenge from
GIVEMETWENTY turning for home, fought back through the furlong grounds and gave way grudgingly. NATURAL POWER (IRE) was outrun early inside,
came off cover going out three wide with a mild run on the far turn, and continued on evenly through the last eighth of a mile. KOKOKOMO bumped with
GRACEFUL KITTEN at the start, raced between horses early near the back, entered the stretch in the two-path and improved mildly for a share.
LOOKINTOGETLUCKY steadied slightly along the rail after a quarter-mile, stayed inside and could not gain. GRACEFUL KITTEN bumped with
KOKOKOMO at the start, vied inside MONFORTE to the far turn, and weakened approaching the quarter-pole. EXPRESS PHAROAH raced three wide
early, and was finished soon after completing a half-mile.

Footnotes
HERO UP took command after the start and moved inside, rated along through an even pace for six furlongs, responded to pressure and stayed clear while
drifting out a bit late. BAD BOY E. J. hugged the rail throughout, and rallied with good energy to be clearly second best. VIOLENT FIGHT put in a mild run
three wide on the far turn, and continued on evenly. SENZAZIONE settled in the middle of the field in the two-path for six furlongs, moved out in the stretch
and rallied mildly. BAHAMIAN PARK chased outside HERO UP for six furlongs, had aim into the lane, but weakened. VINCITORE was outrun for six
furlongs, and improved outside through the late stages. STILL SCHEMIN saved ground in range to the stretch, and steadied in a pocket behind BAHAMIAN
PARK a sixteenth out. MIKE IS READY bumped with EL GRAN CACAO at the start, and lagged in the second flight throughout. YADI was outrun early
inside, moved out three wide to the far turn, and remained far back. SON OF GREATNESS had a four-wide trip, and retired after six furlongs. EL GRAN
CACAO bumped with MIKE IS READY at the start, chased four then three wide early, and stopped on the far turn. JUPI'S LIGHTNING was done early, and
eased up in the lane.
