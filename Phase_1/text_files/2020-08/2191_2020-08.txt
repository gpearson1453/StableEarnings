Footnotes
ONE KEY showed the best early speed and was able to get over to the rail opened a good lead in the stretch and held. CRAFTY'S LAST came three wide
entering the stretch was pushed a bit waiter in the lane while mainly staying clear of the trouble and finished well. CADILLAC CHROME came five wide
entering the stretch and was also clear of the trouble towards the inside through the lane. NEPTUNE'S SEAL was along the inside entering the stretch
lugged out bumping into Mighty Oaks Magic and Silis and after a stewards inquiry was disqualified and placed sixth. MIGHTY OAKS MAGIC was along the
inside on the turn came out to the two path entering the stretch and was bumped hard by Neptune's Seal and lost stride. SILIS was up close to the pace and
was forced to check shortly after entering the stretch with the chain reaction of horses bumping and dropped back after that. FINE WITH ME was well off the
pace and lacked the needed rally while clear of trouble. WAR BEAU raced midpack and then faded while clear of the trouble.

Footnotes
HYPER DRIVE raced in the two path on the turn to get into contention took the lead on the turn and drew clear for the win. HE COULD was three wide up
the backstretch and into the turn and then came out six wide entering the stretch and could not make up ground. SUPERSTYLE raced in the two path on the
turn and could not make headway on the top two but was clearly third best. HOWDY KINGKOWBOY showed the best early speed along the inside as part
of a three horse speed duel but gave way on the turn. RUNN'N REBEL raced along the inside on the turn came out for the drive but lacked the needed rally.
SNEAKY MEEK was well off the pace early came mid track through the stretch but could not make up ground. DANNY'S BAD ROY raced four wide on the
turn and faded in the stretch. DORCHEAT ZARB was well back throughout and never a serious threat.
