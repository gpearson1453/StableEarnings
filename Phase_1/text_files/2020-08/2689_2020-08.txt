Footnotes
SEVEN ON THE ROCKS sprinted to the early lead, hugged the inner rail and dug in tenaciously late to prevail. GOLAZO , outside the winner, gamely
chased that one throughout. TAUBER saved ground around the turn, swung to the three path in upper stretch and finished willingly. HOLY SAINT , three
wide chasing the early pace, dropped back on the turn, floated to the four path in upper stretch then showed a late move outside rivals. KICKSTARTER ,
four wide entering the turn, angled in leaving the bend and failed to rally.

Footnotes
HE'S ONE WILD DUDE saved ground within range, took closer order mid turn, angled four wide into the lane and took aim on the dueling leaders, came in
under right handed rousing when going to command near mid stretch, corrected then edged away under a drive. COOP TRIES HARDER was sent clear
early, set the pace towards the rail, was joined around the turn, dueled with SEVEN GEMS into the lane and past the three sixteenths, could not match
strides with the winner nearing the sixteenth marker but held well to be clear of the rest. CLEVER TRIAD broke a bit slowly, moved up between runners mid
turn, shifted out some for the drive and finished with some interest. SEVEN GEMS broke outward, straightened and advanced outside horses heading to the
turn, prompted three wide then moved to engage the leader past the three eighths, dueled into the lane, checked when the winner came in near the furlong
grounds then faded. OAK BLUFFS settled off the pace, angled five wide into the lane but lacked a serious response. MORE ABUNDANCE saved ground
leaving the far turn and failed to make an impact. JAMMER was outrun while four wide into the lane. ALLTHEWAY TO CAIRO flashed speed about three
wide, rated back off the leaders nearing the turn, chased four wide into the lane and gave way. There was a stewards' inquiry into the run in mid stretch.
Also, there was an objection by the rider of SEVEN GEMS against the winner alleging interference in mid stretch. No action was taken.

DEPOSITORY , firmly in hand early on while about four wide, cruised up outside rivals approaching the stretch, moved clear leaving the quarter pole,
responded when set down in mid stretch and widened while kept to task. ROMP dropped far back and was unhurried early on, angled four wide nearing the
lane, leveled off when put to left handed asking leaving the three sixteenths and finished with good energy to gain the place. CYCLO sped to the early lead
while off the inside, rated off HOUSE IMPEACHMENT leaving the six furlong marker, chased two wide, came back to threaten a bit mid turn, pursued into
the lane and kept on trying to the line. FIRE'S FINALE angled out advancing out of the chute, stalked three wide, bid between runners mid turn, forced the
issue under a ride entering the lane then gave way grudgingly in the final seventy yards. TAKE PROFIT , five wide outside the winner nearing the five
eighths, dropped in around the turn and chased while in the clear, came back out for the drive but went evenly late. HOUSE IMPEACHMENT pulled his way
forward and took command towards the inside after a quarter mile, spurted clear soon after, was joined mid turn, held willingly to about the three sixteenths
then faded. ELUSIVE , off the pace while two to three wide, was not a factor. GANDOLFO saved ground, was under a solid drive past the half mile marker
and faltered.

Footnotes
IRISHTOWN , rated behind horses mid way down the backstretch, angled out leaving approaching the turn, circled four deep, floated to the six path entering
the stretch, drifted to the eight path when taking command in mid stretch and was under urging in the drive. LUDICROUS MODE lacked speed, swung to
the six path in mid stretch, remained on his left lead and rallied. DHARMASTER stalked the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, drifted to the five path
turning for home and finished willingly. MAKES MO CENTS , well placed along the inner rail around the turn, failed to rally. ABSALOM accelerated to the
early lead, set the pace near the rail and tired. LECTRIC CHOKE , a forward factor in the two path between horses leaving the turn, weakened through the
stretch. JERICHO MARSH , two wide chasing the pace to the stretch, gave way. MINE TO HOLD was not a factor. FANTASIZE , an early factor in the three
path between horses down the backstretch, gave way.

RAGTIME SUZY broke outward and bumped with LAUREL LADY, corrected and bid to the inside of JUST FOR SPITE to take command five furlongs out,
cleared within herself and set a rated pace off the inside, moved away after being roused past the three sixteenths, was kept alert to about the sixteenth
marker then coasted home. ARBUTUS chased the pace three to four wide into the lane and churned on to be second best. EXPECT TALK , off the pace,
was under pressure off the rail mid turn, circled five wide into the lane and offered a mild response. MAJORIE MUGS saved ground, made a mild run along
the rail near mid stretch then faded. LAUREL LADY , bumped at the break, was not a factor. JUST FOR SPITE sped to the early lead, was headed from the
inside near the five eighths pole, pursued around the turn and weakened.

KARAN'S NOTION bore in bumping ABUELO PAPS leaving the starting gate, advanced three deep leaving the turn, challenged for the lead outside
NAUTICAL NATURE entering the stretch,dueled outside that one and determinedly prevailed. NAUTICAL NATURE challenged for the lead in the two path
between horses mid way on the turn, dueled through the stretch and just missed in a game performance. ABUELO PAPS bumped OUTSIDE THE BOX
when coming in at the start, was bumped and forced in by the winner soon after the break, circled the turn four wide and rallied. PADRINO'S HEART raced
along the inner rail on the turn and failed to rally in an even effort. OUTSIDE THE BOX , bumped leaving the starting gate, was bumped and steadied soon
after that, raced in the three path between horses on the turn and lacked a rally. GRATEFUL BRED accelerated to the early lead, angled in, hugged the
inner rail around the turn and gave way in the drive. JOSEPH , three deep leaving the turn, was outurn. GODLOVESASINNER trailed. An objection by the
rider of ABUELO PAPS against KARAN'S NOTION for alleged interference leaving the starting gate was not allowed.

Footnotes
HANALEI'S HOUDINI , patiently handled tracking towards the inside, eased out and moved between rivals mid turn, dropped back in and bid to take
command into the lane, spurted clear off the rail and kept on under solid encouragement to keep TATTOOED at bay. TATTOOED stalked four wide, ranged
up around the turn, was put to a solid drive past the three sixteenths, kept on gamely but wasn't quite good enough. HARD FOUGHT prompted the pace
outside ATREYU, moved to a slim lead after a half mile, briefly went clear, was surrounded from both sides mid turn, sparred into the lane then gave way in
the final furlong. ATREYU moved to command to the inside of HARD FOUGHT, vied past the half mile pole, was overwhelmed mid turn, faltered and was
eased through the lane.

THATWOULDBEGRAND prompted the early pace, secured command two wide near the three eighths pole, steadily pulled away through the stretch and
was kept to his business in the drive. JUNGLE WARRIOR bore out leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four wide and gained the place.
LORDHAVEMERCY , three wide around the turn, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. GONE HOME sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail
around the turn and gave way approaching the stretch. MOON WATCHER , along the inner rail on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and dropped
back.
