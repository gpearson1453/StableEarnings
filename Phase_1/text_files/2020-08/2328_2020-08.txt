Footnotes
BISCOTTINI, urged through close quarters in the opening stages to gain terms prompting the pacesetter, pressed the issue nearing upper stretch and
edged forward under brisk right handed pressure. AIR WALKER tracked off the first flight along the inside, advanced along the rail into the lane to challenge
inside the eventual winner but proved only second best. ZANSHOES, four wide in the opening stages, dropped off the first flight while angling inwards,
steadily gained position between foes nearing upper stretch, shifted out to bid three deep nearing the furlong marker but was outkicked by the top pair.
MIZONEY exchanged light contact with ESTHER in early stages, was righted to gain a forward placing three deep stalking just outside the first flight racing
into the turn, was fanned four wide nearing midstretch and had no final response. LADY PALOMA, urged along the rail disputing the pace from the outset
into the turn, gave way in late stages. ESTHER exchanged brushes early, was settled well off the first flight between foes and failed to menace thereafter.
STUNNED dropped out early.

Footnotes
CLASSY PAPA, urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, edged clear racing into upper stretch while shifting out under left
handed pressure but maintained a clear margin under firm handling. WHATA PERFECT DAY exchanged bumps with GOLDEN SCEPTOR at the start, was
righted to gain terms with the first flight three deep between foes stalking the leaders into to the backstretch, moved to challenge in that path racing into
upper stretch but couldn't gain terms with the winner while prevailing for the place honors. WANNAPLAYBIGCHIEF, forwardly placed four wide attending
the pace in the opening half, was urged to advance in that path nearing upper stretch but was outkicked for the top pair. BIGDADDY'SFLYINGHI settled
along the inside tracking off the first flight to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, shifted to the five path midstretch and gained some position
while making no real impression. GOLDEN SCEPTOR exchanged bumps with WHATA PERFECT DAY at the start, was quickly collected while angling
inwards to force the pace between foes racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn and emptied out into the lane. TAKINTHENITETRAIN,
shuffled out of tight quarters at the break, never gained contention. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
NEVERBLINK switched outside the leaders in early stages to track off the first flight into the turn, advanced in tandem with a rival to bid for command three
deep between foes nearing upper stretch, edged forward in the closing stages and held FORTNITE DANCE to the end under pressure. The latter broke
awkwardly dropping well off the field, split foes gathering momentum racing into the turn, swung six wide in upper stretch and was going well late. SMELLIN
CANDY tracked just off the first flight outside foes in early stages, advanced to challenge four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a mild bid. MR.
COUGAR settled off the second flight racing in the five path early, shifted out five wide entering the lane while being prompted to advance but lacked the
needed late kick. MAJOR BIZKIT angled to the inside disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, dueled into upper stretch while striking the
front but yielded in late stages. HOLD THAT THOUGHT tracked off the first flight along the inside, altered course avoiding a tiring foe racing into upper
stretch but had no rally. SLEEPY TURTLE angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn and, gave way abruptly into
the lane.

ZOE'S DELIGHT, a bit washy in the post parade, was rated along the inside stalking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide
nearing upper stretch and produced a solid closing response to wrest command and go well clear under mild hand urging. CANDY PRINCE urged inside
rivals dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, dueled for command on the far turn into upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors
while proving no match for the winner. CAPTAIN DRAKE was rated off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was urged to advance three
wide on the far turn challenging for command but lacked the needed final kick. FINN COUNTRY gained terms prompting a rival's pace in the opening half,
pressed the issue between foes on the far turn and gave way leaving midstretch.

Footnotes
VICTIM took up a position tracking the pacesetter from out of striking distance racing three deep between foes into the far turn, shifted out four wide entering
the far turn while being prompted to advance, took over nearing upper stretch while shifting inwards a bit and maintained a safe advantage holding
SUMMER LOVIN to the end under firm left handed pressure. The latter angled to the rail in the opening stages while settling into last, saved ground into the
second bend gathering momentum, switched outside rivals nearing upper stretch to advance four deep, moved to challenge the winner in the last furlong but
was outkicked. GREATEST GAL tracked the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the backstretch, angled out to bid three wide between foes racing through
the far turn, shifted inside disputing the issue inside the eventual winner but weakened late. TRIPLE MALT angled to the inside stalking the pacesetter under
light reserve in the opening half, bid for command along the rail entering the far turn, gained a brief advantage between calls nearing the lane, then shifted
out once headed by the winner while giving way. DRANE FAME, caught four wide dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued in that
path to the far turn but lacked a rally. CHICLE SPARKS urged to the lead while shifting off the inside racing to the first turn, set the pace off the rail into the
far turn and gave out nearing upper stretch.

TANTIMA tracked off the first flight three wide between foes from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, made a steady advance in that path
on the far turn to challenge for command racing into the stretch, drifted out in the closing stages but edged clear under pressure. ADDED DIAMONDS,
urged to the lead outside a rival racing to the backstretch, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the second bend, dueled for command on the far turn,
then between foes through the lane but couldn't contain the winner while edging a rival for the place honors. LEFT OF CENTER broke inwards brushing
NOTE PAD at the break, was prompted to gain a forward placing along the inside prompting the leader, pressed the issue on the far turn into the lane but
was outkicked by the top pair. MS KELA TIME, held up avoiding close quarters in the opening stages, tracked the leaders between foes as part of the
second flight racing to the far turn and continued evenly in late stages. CANTERBURY GOLD, a step slow at the start, was caught four wide racing through
the first turn while prompted to position in second flight, was shuffled back from that position to drop out last nearing the far turn, angled out five wide racing
into the lane but had no closing bid. NOTE PAD, brushed at the start, tracked off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
inside foes racing into the far turn but came up empty nearing upper stretch. TEMPLES MON CHERI settled between foes in the last flight early, angled to
the inside after a half but lacked a rally. FOR SARAS SAKE settled four wide in the last flight racing to the backstretch, continued in that path to the second
bend and emptied out entering the far turn.

COCO LOCO MAMA broke readily to gain terms attending a rival's pace under light restraint, took over under her own courage nearing the lane while
shifting out three deep, then kicked away under some mild urging. WESTERN ATTIRE angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing through
the backstretch, switched out to bid between foes inside the eventual winner but couldn't gain terms with that foe while holding well for the place honors.
OAKLIE GAL broke awkwardly while dropping out last, switched out racing through the backstretch, angled four wide racing into the lane but offered no
rally. LA TORMENTA broke sharply, sped to the lead along the inside and gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
GOTHAM CITY QUEEN, urged three deep between foes disputing the pace in the opening stages, angled to the inside once gaining the advantage, then
forged clear into the stretch and widened late under left handed pressure. HURRICAIN HUNTER tracked the leaders four wide in second flight early,
advanced three wide into the turn to challenge for command nearing the lane, soon proved no match but bested the others. PRINCESA DEL SOL urged
inside the eventual winner prompting the pace into the turn, was rated conceding some position racing into the turn, then gave way into the stretch while
continuing well enough along the rail to prevail for a share. ROSES FOR DOUG tracked off the second flight along the inside, shifted out four wide racing
into the turn while being prompted to advance but offered no rally. BOOZIN AT BOZOS, off slowly, made brief progress pursuing the leader three wide
between foes into the turn but flattened out nearing upper stretch. SWEET ECLIPSE angled in sharply in early stages to track just off the pacesetter
between foes but gave way midway through the turn. SURELY A LEGEND angled to the inside early tracking just off the leaders, was shuffled a bit
avoidingPRINCESA DEL SOL and emptied out early. DATA QUICK, shuffled back, then taken up out of close quarters at the start, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SATELLITE, reserved while angling inwards a bit to track well off the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide gathering momentum
leaving the far turn and produced a stout rally in that path to wrest the advantage in time under brisk left handed pressure. BLUE BOMBER tracked the
leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight in the opening half, steadily drew into range shifting three deep racing into upper stretch, then bid between
foes for command nearing the wire to just miss. OUT OF PATIENCE was rated off the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail nearing the
far turn, saved ground to upper stretch, shifted out to bid between foes in late stages striking the front but was just headed at the wire. HERBIE, urged to a
forward placing three deep racing to the first turn, continued to prompt a rival's pace through the backstretch, pressed the issue entering the far turn, edged
forward to a clear advantage racing into upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum. MONEY BROKER broke outwards bumping SLICK AS ICE, was
righted, then came under firm rating along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, continued inside a rival as part of the second flight,
shifted out entering the lane but had no late response. SLICK AS ICE, bumped, then knocked back at the start, settled last and failed to menace thereafter.
LOGAN'S LEOPARD broke inwards bumping SLICK AS ICE after the start, was righted, then urged to the lead a bit off the inside into the backstretch,
dueled inside a rival into the far turn and gave way nearing upper stretch.
