Footnotes
KLICKITAT went to the front then moved clear early, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way through moderate fractions, controlled the action
while inside on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came out under a strong hand ride into upper stretch, was put to a right-handed whip
approaching the furlong marker then drifted back towards the rail and drew off under steady urging. SELFMADE went three wide on the first turn, settled on
the outside, raced three wide on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under a right-handed whip, switched to a
left-handed whip in pursuit of the winner at the three-sixteenths, drifted out into the final furlong then was switched back to a right-handed whip outside the
sixteenth-pole and safely secured the place. DIANNESIMPAZIBLE went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved at the back of the field, went
three wide on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths then driven four wide into the stretch under the whip, moved out more under a drive around the
three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. SPIRITUAL KING was asked to establish a forward position early, raced inside to
the two path on the first turn, tracked the winner down the backstretch, was asked in the two path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch under a drive
and tired. BROADWAY JOE was taken in hand early then settled on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a mild
hand ride and failed to rally. MR. FIDGET became rank under restraint on the initial straightaway, bumped with foes on both sides into the first turn, rounded
that bend in the three path, was reserved under stout restraint while still keen early on the backstretch, leveled out some before the half-mile pole, was let
out in the two path on the far turn then roused late on that bend, came under the whip in upper stretch and failed to threaten. PETRUS was bumped and
forced five wide into the first turn, continued four to five wide on that bend, was reserved towards the back on the outside, came under urging in the three
path on the far turn, was put to the whip outside the quarter-pole and failed to respond. PARSON was last to commence then urged along early, bumped
with a rival into the first turn, saved ground on that bend, settled towards the back, was urged along while inside on the far turn and also failed to respond.

Footnotes
LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE lightly hand urged out-breaking the competition by about a length, remained forwardly placed, disputed the pace from path two,
with a couple of others within striking distance parked out three and four wide respectively, began to edge away sputtering towards the five path for entrance
into the stretch, extended the advantage, appeared to switch back to the wrong lead in the general area of the sixteenth pole, drifted out a bit but stayed
sufficiently in the clear. COTTON stalked the pace from the three path, got driven three wide into the stretch, rider keeping at the task as the winner crossed
over in front at the head of the stretch, ventured onward, proved no match. BOHEMIAN RUBY pursued the pace hand urged on the backstretch, stepped
onto the turn and saw the pilot resort to a drive shortly afterwards, was worked into the five path from upper to midlane, went on to secure the show. COBRA
KAI stayed stationed along the inside route after the start, was hand ridden travelling on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, lacked the necessary
response. SEVEN SEVEN strung out four wide on the turn, came into the stretch, shifted in one path backing away. SANDOR CLEGANE contended for the
top from the rail until the quarter pole before faltering. Following a claim of foul lodged by the rider of COTTON against the rider of LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE
alleging interference at the quarter pole in addition to a Stewards' Inquiry, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
KEMBA broke very fast and went straight to the front, was well rated while setting an uncontested pace on the inside, responded well when asked outside
the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed whip in upper stretch, swapped back to her inside lead just inside the furlong marker, went back to the proper
lead when switched to a left-handed whip and given one crack at the sixteenth-pole then was held together to the wire while much the best. HOT BUTTON
went around the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, rounded the far turn in the two path, was given her cue near the five-sixteenths,
chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while just able to hold the place. BASELINE DRIVE broke a half-step slow, went
two to three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused while two then three wide on the far turn, came under the whip outside the
quarter-pole, was carried out in upper stretch and finished willingly to just miss the place while clear for the show. HALO CITY settled on the inside, was
asked near the five-sixteenths, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. MISCHIEF REIGNS broke a step slow, went two to three wide
on the first turn, settled outside towards the rear, was roused while inside on the far turn and failed to threaten. CAREFREE HIGHWAY was recalcitrant
behind the gate then reared over and unseated the rider, entered the gate after being deemed fit to run by the state veterinarian, came away in good order,
tucked in nearing the first turn, went two to three wide on that bend, settled outside in third position, was asked while three then four wide on the far turn and
faltered. GOLDEN CELINE broke a step slow, saved ground at the rear, fell well behind late on the backstretch, raced inside under urging on the far turn
and showed little. (Rail at 27 Feet)

Footnotes
HONOR WAY off the inside throughout, departed the backstretch from the two path, was maneuvered into path five from the top of the turn to the
five-sixteenths marker, closing the gap all the while with the pilot atop with a snug grip on the reins, spun into the lane and went on to challenge in earnest in
the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, left the eighth pole in charge, padded the winning margin, kept to some encouragement to the end. FAIR REGIS
sneaked its way into the pocket approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, kept an eye on the front runners well rated until a short distance from the
quarter pole, was under a drive angling into path four in upper stretch, failed to keep pace with the winner, arrived at the finish line in time to salvage
second. SLIMEY took up the chase from the two path, teamed up with the rail-skimming VAST, got switched over to a drive at the five-sixteenths pole
fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, appeared to have good momentum striking the eighth pole, maintained it, fell
short of snagging away the place after completing her energetic rally. KEPT TRUE sparred for the top from path two after making contact with JENNEMILY
in the shadow of the starting gate, kept at it until the head of the stretch before backing away. BRIDLEWOOD CAT sighted pulling a bit on the backstretch,
argued for control from along the inside until around the three-sixteenths pole, faltered. VAST guided over to the rail after brushing into the right side of the
starting gate, was spotted in the two path at the top of the lane, had no response. JENNEMILY bumped at the start, pursued the pace four wide on the turn,
was slightly wider spinning into the stretch, backed away. SKAMANIA sat forwardly placed three wide, got set down leaving the five-sixteenths pole, went
into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ARCHUMYBABY established a good position just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, moved out from behind
rivals in upper stretch then came under a right-handed whip, switched to a left-handed whip inside the furlong marker, rallied outside into the final sixteenth
and got up in the final strides under strong urging. KEEP YOUR DISTANCE disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, was
asked inside the five-sixteenths then shook clear approaching the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed whip at the top of the stretch, dropped to the rail
before the three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed whip inside the furlong marker, remained clear into the final sixteenth, battled determinedly to the wire
but was denied while able to get the place. DARIA'S ANGEL moved out near the five-eighths pole, was well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two path
on the turn, was given his her cue nearing the quarter-pole, came between horses under a drive in upper stretch, chased under the whip into the final
furlong and finished willingly for the show. EXCESS CAPACITY moved out outside the five-eighths pole, settled on the outside, ranged up four wide on the
turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, chased under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. LADY BY CHOICE broke out and bumped with a
rival then was taken up with a snatch of the left rein, spotted the front a few lengths, raced towards the rear under reserve, started the turn in the two path,
moved to three then four wide under urging later on that bend, was driven five wide into the stretch, chased outside under the whip into the final furlong and
lacked the needed response. MO FLASH disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, dropped
back under a drive into upper stretch and tired. BEYOND DISCREET broke a bit slow, was taken in hand early then settled at the rear, fell well behind in the
two path on the turn and was no factor. QUEEN KAHEN broke a bit slow then bumped with a rival, spotted the front a few lengths, settled on the outside,
went five wide on the turn, dropped back while six wide into the stretch and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
GIACOSA taken in hand getting forced inward due to pressure coming from AMOS at the start, tucked into the two path in time for the commencement of
the run around the clubhouse bend, sat well reserved towards the back of the pack during the opening phases, remained on hold forced to draft behind
cover, which included a shifting TATTERAZZI, as three-quarters was being completed, turned into the lane with its path now open for use, said clearance
inadvertently provided by a couple of front runners that had just gone wider themselves,responded when given her cue, bursting upon the scene at the
furlong marker as a bold threat, wrested away the advantage after splitting foes, edged away then ventured onward with good determination to stay in the
clear. SILKY BLUE was rated along prompting the pace from path two, hitched up to FREDDYMO FACTOR as the third fraction was being finalized, settled
in upper stretch before challenging in earnest three wide, fought its way to a slim lead, only to have the top one bearing down hard from the left, relinquished
soon afterwards, momentarily came out with approximately a sixteenth to go, fleetingly interrupting JEN'S BATTLE, held a truer course thereafter after being
corrected en route for the place. JEN'S BATTLE took up chase strung out three wide on both turns, fanned out into path five from upper to midlane for the
best of racing room, felt the presence of SILKY BLUE in a negative manner for about a jump in the general area of the sixteenth pole, saw that one correct
course, rallied for the show. TATTERAZZI pocketed for nearly six furlongs, slipped to the outside as the field was reaching the quarter pole, got ridden three
wide into the lane, put in its best bid during the ensuing furlong before flattening out. AMOS got yanked to the outside after coming in at the start, but not
before inducing a couple of others to move inward themselves, travelled three wide on the first run, was one path closer to the rail on the subsequent one,
got cued up at the five-sixteenths marker, swung four wide into the lane, fizzled out. FREDDYMO FACTOR launched itself to the top with a two wide run,
got guided onto the inside route at the beginning of the backstretch, showed the way, shadowed by the runner up from the outside, came under heavier
pressure from that opponent late on the far turn, succumbed when fully tested soon afterwards and backed away. WILD NORTH appeared unsettled racing
in the two path in between rivals on the clubhouse bend, found refuge on the inside at the half mile pole, angled three wide for the drive, had no rally.
MAGICAL ROMANCE saved ground for three-quarters pole, got moved out three wide entering the stretch to no avail. Following a General Stewards'
Inquiry focusing on the stretch run, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

JACKIE'S WARRIOR brushed the near side stall at the start bobbling slightly while under hustling to the front, crossed to show the way in hand along the
inside through swift splits, took to the two path around the turn coming under pressure from a pair just inside the three-eighths, shook off one rival between
foes nearing the quarter pole and got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch confronted by the runner up, dug in under a drive drawing away
through the stretch to the finish kept to task. THERIDEOFALIFETIME four wide in pursuit just off the leader, came under coaxing half a mile from home,

mile pole, angled four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals in the drive showing interest to the finish. MARKET ALERT brushed the off side stall at
the start, chased four then three wide from mid pack under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. PICKIN' TIME

Footnotes
YELLEN disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear under a right-handed whip while still on her inside lead in
upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead inside the furlong marker then was switched to a left-handed whip and was fully extended to last under strong
urging. JASMINESQUE broke out then brushed twice with a rival, was taken back while crowded against the fence early, moved out nearing the half-mile
pole, went three then four wide on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came five wide into the stretch under the whip, rallied outside in the final
furlong and closed strongly to just miss while narrowly able to get the place. DIPPING IN settled towards the rear, was patiently ridden while inside to the
two path through the turn then roused in upper stretch, angled out inside the furlong marker, closed strongly between horses late and just missed in a
three-way photo while able to get the show. ROMA CARPE bumped with a rival at the start, was well placed while tucked in just off the pace, drafted near
the rail on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased under a drive in the stretch and was outfinished. MICROCAP bumped with a foe at the start,
stalked the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, was given her cue at the quarter-pole, chased outside under a drive in the stretch and was
out-kicked. TILSA broke a half-step slow then brushed with a foe, settled off the pace, was roused near the seven-sixteenths, went two to three wide on the
turn, came under the whip inside the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. MORALITY CLAUSE disputed the pace on the outside of the winner,
vied outside that foe in the two path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and weakened. TESORINA broke a step slow, moved up to
race just off the pace, dropped back on the turn and came up empty. (Rail at 27 Feet)
