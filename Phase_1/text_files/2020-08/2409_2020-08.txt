MINE TO HOLD , a forward factor along the inner rail down the backstretch, dropped back a bit on the turn, swung to the four path entering the stretch,
gained command outside I'VE GOTTA PLAN near the eighth pole and drew clear. I'VE GOTTA PLAN set an easy pace in the two path, was set down in
upper stretch and weakened the final furlong. PARATYCACHACA , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened through the stretch. Due to a
malfunction, there were no fractions and the final time was hand timed.

DIXIE DRAWL , nudged to four wide to contention, dropped in and shadowed KELLI'S SMILE, was scrubbed clear of that one after six furlongs, eagerly
opened up after being put to a drive past the three sixteenths then continued as much the best while ridden out the final seventy yards. GALATIANS tracked
towards the inside, moved between foes nearing the quarter pole and kept on willingly to earn the place. BELLARMINE HALL settled off the pace and was
taken four wide for the backstretch run, edged up three wide leaving the far turn, chased into the lane but was out finished for second. WELLING stalked the
embattled leaders three wide, was under pressure into the far turn, failed to kick on and faded around the final turn. KELLI'S SMILE took over into the first
turn, was joined by the winner past the seven eighths, dueled to the three eighths pole then had little left after six furlongs.

JOSEF IS REAL made all the pace, saved ground around the turn and was under intermittent urging in the drive. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME , three deep
around the turn, moved up to second turning for home, failed to rally and held the place. LASTING IMAGE , two wide on the turn, chased the winner and
weakened inside horses. RIPKEN saved ground on the turn, angled out in mid stretch and offered a mild, late gain. MY BOY PADDY stumbled leaving the
starting gate then trailed.

TOP LINE GROWTH had speed to lead early then was rated back off JOHN JONES leaving the three quarter pole, tracked three wide under confident
handling, moved without much asking and drew alongside mid turn, assumed command into the lane, kicked away after being set down soon after and
proved much the best while steadily hand ridden the final seventy yards. TACO SUPREAM stalked the pace between rivals, emerged as the closest pursuer
past the furlong grounds and held well for second money. TYBALT , bumped at the break, settled off the rail and behind a trio of runners, was put to a
hustling ride after a half mile, circled the turn then swung seven wide for the drive, straightened to make progress past mid stretch but hung late and was out
finished for the place. COMPOUND IT broke awkward and bumped with TYBALT, corrected and stalked three to four wide, was under pressure between
foes past the quarter pole then finished up evenly. JOHN JONES was nudged on and went up to the inside of rivals to take over after about a quarter mile,
spurted clear soon after, set the pace about two wide, was taken on leaving the far turn, dueled to the head of the lane then gave way nearing the furlong
grounds. AWESOME D J moved up along the rail to gain a stalking spot after a half mile, pursued into the stretch then faded.

Footnotes
HOSTILE WITNESS lacked speed, swung to the four path leaving the turn, closed outside horses, led inside the sixteenth pole, drew clear and lugged in
late. BACK CHARGE opened up leaving the backstretch, set the pace near the rail and tired the final sixteenth of a mile. SECURITY BREACH , well placed
in the two path on the turn, failed to rally. SWEET ASTA , bumped and squeezed back leaving the starting gate, chased the pace to the stretch then tired.
CECIL THE LION was not a factor. BLADE O was outrun. FLASHARINO bumped SWEET ASTA when bearing in at the break, faltered, returned sore and
was vanned off.

FAST MASTER came away alertly then was allowed to draft back off the early pace while about four wide, dropped to the rail nearing the half mile marker,
gained inside rivals past the three eighths, angled back out and advanced four wide into the lane, came in slightly under right handed rousing when forging
clear in mid stretch, was soon corrected and widened a bit while kept to task. THUNDER DAY was taken back soon after the break and guided to the rail,
moved up approaching the turn, eased out and gained three wide approaching the stretch, steadied briefly near the furlong grounds, regrouped and kept on
with decent energy while clear of the rest. GONE HOME opened up early, set the pace two wide and increased his advantage past the three eighths, had
his lead dwindle nearing the lane, failed to resist challenges inside the three sixteenths and weakened late. BAMBINO , off the pace, was ridden along two
to three wide nearing the lane but lacked a serious response. MOON WATCHER chased two wide, shifted out some for the drive and came up empty.
IRISH CROSSING gave early pursuit three wide and weakened. MARYLAND BANDIT , four wide, raced in range to the turn then retreated.

Footnotes
GALERIO bid to the inside of BROOKS ROBINSON after a furlong, dueled with that one while in about the two path, shook clear in upper stretch, widened
under a strong drive in mid stretch, wandered outward and was under hand encouragement late. TOMMY SHELBY saved ground, was under a hustling ride
mid turn, stayed inside and leveled off near mid stretch, churned on willingly and earned the place. CRUSH IT , four to five wide, took closer order past the
five sixteenths, shifted in through the final furlong and kept on with effort. WHISKEY AND YOU chased two wide, was under heavy pressure mid turn but
lacked a solid finish. SIR BACK IN BLACK edged up between foes then was lightly steadied near the half mile marker, angled out mid turn, came five wide
for the drive but lacked the needed kick. CAREY TIMES gave hard chase three to four wide, shifted in some near mid stretch and came up empty. BROOKS
ROBINSON had speed three wide, was joined from the inside after a furlong and got engaged in a duel, sparred outside the winner to the head of the lane
then gave way. BULLETS CHILD hesitated at the break then veered out, corrected to be about six wide, remained well wide under some rating, drifted out
into the lane then was eased in the final furlong.

Footnotes
NAUTICAL NATURE broke alertly and was quickly clear, set the pace off the rail, responded to urging in the stretch and drew away.
WILLMAKEYOUHAPPY circled the turn three wide, took aim on the leader in upper stretch and weakened the final furlong. INSIDE RISK saved ground
around the turn, remained near the rail in the stretch and steadily weakened. TIME FLIES BY lacked speed, raced along the inner rail around the turn and
was never a factor. COOL MAN CLETUS raced in the two path between horses on the turn and gave way.
