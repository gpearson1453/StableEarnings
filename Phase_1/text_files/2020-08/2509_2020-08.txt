Footnotes
RIDGE WEST ran just off the pacesetter, vied from the five path on the turn, took command at the eighth pole and won clear. KING LOMAX tracked inside
behind the pace, took the five path on the turn and gamely chased the winner down the stretch, though settling for place. FREEDOM MIKE was the early
speed inside, vied with a foe down the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. FIGHTIN WITH PRIDE was never close, widest in the stretch and improved
position late. VOLUME ON TAP chased closer early, then further back and needed more in the stretch. FOLLOW THE MAGIC was unruly behind the gate,
veered in at the start, saved ground on the turn from well back, and was not a threat.

DANZO was close early, ranged up three wide on the turn, led past the eighth pole and held on to win in a head bob. PULL ME BACK chased, moved closer
on the turn, continued on to catch the winner in deep stretch and just missed at the wire. OLA QUE TAL raced off the pace, quickened on the turn, came
wide into the stretch, drifted out and passed tired foes late. RAF was away last, stayed back to the stretch and improved position in the final furlong. GET
SOME MO showed speed inside, had a clear lead on the turn, was off the rail in the stretch and weakened in the last furlong. CAZMAN chased to the
stretch, gained till the eighth pole and flattened out late. BOOGIE MAN was up close early, lost position on the turn and weakened in deep stretch.
MOODY'S BROTHER pressed the pace from the inside, dropped back on the turn and tired in the stretch.

out a bit from off the rail entering the main track, moved up to press the leader from inside, dropped off the lead on the turn, and kept on for fourth while
lacking the needed rally down the stretch. ENGLISH TOFFE ROSE was never close but improved position in the stretch. ORBIT THE MOON bumped a

Footnotes
SOUTHERN HUMOR raced alongside the early leader in hand, readily took over entering the turn, led clear by mid turn and widened from there under some
urging. KING BING HAWK was urged from the gate, waited, rallied on the turn, gained second but was no match for the winner. C C THE BOSS moved up
from the back on the turn, angled in down the stretch and had a mild rally for show. KAWA was hustled away from the gate, raced just behind the
pacesetters, followed the winner on the turn, could not keep pace and weakened down the stretch. GO UNCLE JOEZ GO was early speed on the inside,
dropped back on the turn and drifted out in the stretch while fading. BIG BAD SHACK was wide on the backstretch, quickened on the turn in the four path,
and faltered in upper stretch.
