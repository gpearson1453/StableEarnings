MEAN ERIKA settled well, advanced between foes on the turn and edged clear in the stretch under a drive. SWEET TATUM dueled early, inched clear on
the turn, proved no match in the stretch and stayed on. FABULOUS GIRL was fractious behind the starting gate, stalked the pace and lost her position on
the turn. SWEET SONG raced forwardly while five wide and offered no response when asked. INDIAN GEM settled well, urged on the turn, was steadied
when short of room at the quarter mile marker and could not menace in the stretch. GRAY SKY MESA veered out at the start and did not factor. EURO ME
chased along the inside and faltered.
