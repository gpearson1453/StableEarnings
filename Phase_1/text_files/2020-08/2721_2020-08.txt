Footnotes
GHAALEB'S SICILIAN rated at the back from well off the rail on the backstretch, was roused four wide on the turn, took over upper stretch and steadily
opened up on the rest while kept to urging. ELIZABETH'S FEVER exchanged bumps with STAR MAGNA at the break, vied for the lead outside
SPONTANEITY, moved ahead on the turn, was clear entering the lane, was no match for GHAALEB'S SICILIAN the last furlong but won her battle to keep
second. STAR MAGNA was bumped then bumped ELIZABETH'S FEVER at the start, found herself boxed in most of the backstretch and in tight quarters
on the turn, got through two wide at the top of the stretch, fought for second but lacked the extra needed in the waning yards. PRECIOUS KOWGIRL
chased from inside, angled out on the bend, came widest into the lane and passed outside tired ones the final furlong. GHOST TRAIN raced in the second
flight from outside, was three wide on the bend, bumped with STAR MAGNA leaving the quarter pole, yielded some entering the lane, altered out for a clear
path upper stretch then ran evenly to the wire. AMERICAN HOLIDAY caught in tight between horses on the backstretch, was shuffled back on the bend and
could only make up minor ground on the second flight deep stretch. SPONTANEITY displayed early speed from inside but began to wear down before
finishing six furlongs.

Footnotes
W W TRAFALGAR shared the early lead from outside, moved ahead three wide on the bend, angled in some when clear entering the lane, was soon
challenged from outside, battled gamely, bumped with AHEADOFTHEGAME nearing the wire and got the nod at the finish. AHEADOFTHEGAME was
bumped solidly shortly after leaving the chute, was kept close toward the outside, four wide on the turn, angled in some entering the lane, engaged W W
TRAFALGAR upper stretch, fought tgo. TAZ ATTACK angled in leaving the chute, bumping AHEADOFTHEGAME, was three to five wide taking the bend,
jostled by LINE OF DENHAMS midstretch then outfinished the latter for the show. LINE OF DENHAMS prominent early, angled out through the turn, came
four wide into the lane, drifted out under left-handed pressure midstretch, jostled briefly with TAZ ATTACK, was corrected, raced with that one to the wire
and had to settle for fourth. EL RAYO D'SHERGAR disputed the pace between rivals on the backstretch but began to slowly yield two wide leaving the turn.
A BOLD RYDE displayed early speed from inside, did not stay with W W TRAFALGAR leaving the bend and flattened out along the rail through the lane.
BOOGY SOKS was widest taking the turn and lacked a serious stretch bid. COUNTRY RODEO was soon well back, urged along but showed little
response.

Footnotes
STUMP was quickly clear, rated through the bend, roused leaving the turn, was kept to a drive to the last sixteenth and proved clearly best. SUMMER
DISCO in the second flight on the backstretch, did not keep up just off the inside on the turn, fanned four wide for the stretch run, was all out and caught
PEACOCK MAN for second in the final strides. PEACOCK MAN advanced from outside to take over second three wide leaving the bend, was no match for
STUMP in the lane, weakened in the late going, was outfinished for second but easily best of the others. MEADOWLEE'S AFLEET raced in the second
flight between rivals on the backstretch, gained the rail on the turn and flattened out the last furlong. INTONATION stayed well off the inside taking the bend
and had little to offer for the drive.

TABADDOL advanced outside to share the lead on the backstretch, was three wide on the second turn, did not stay with UNCLE PADDY leaving that bend,
floated out some entering the stretch, rallied under a drive, gradually angled out to stay clear of UNCLE PADDY inside the last furlong and got up in time.
UNCLE PADDY reluctant to load, broke outward, bumping AMERICAN SUCCESS, waited for room just off the rail, got through two wide with a half mile to
go, had the rail on the second bend, moved clear leaving that turn, his rider lost his whip nearing the furlong marker, UNCLE PADDY steadily drifted out
inside the last eighth and was outfinished. JACK N JOHN was steadied in traffic shortly after the break and settled inside, picked up his pace after a half
mile and found best stride too late in the lane. AMERICAN SUCCESS bumped at the start, displayed early speed from inside, was settled back when his
path was taken leaving the half mile marker, just off the inside taking the second bend, was all out through the stretch and rallied belatedly. LEFT COAST
DREAMS chased from outside, closed the gap some while three wide on the second turn, fanned out into the lane and made up minor ground the last
furlong. RUDY'S BOY disputed the pace between rivals for six furlongs then began to wear down. Due to a timer malfunction, the race was hand timed.

Footnotes
I LUV THIS BAR jostled between rivals leaving the chute, progressed just off the inside to gain the advantage two wide on the bend, was roused in the
stretch, under steady urging the last furlong and kept AWESOME INDRA at bay. AWESOME INDRA was away slowly, advanced from inside, waited for
room on the bend, squeezed through two wide approaching the quarter pole, took the rail upper stretch, moved clear for second, fought to the wire but
lacked the extra needed. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE was hustled along from between rivals, advanced four wide on the turn, floated out some into the stretch
and found best stride too late. CAROLINA BEAST a step slow at the break, was squeezed and steadied back leaving the chute, advanced from inside on
the turn, split rivals three wide leaving the bend, angled out some for a clear path upper stretch then ran evenly the final eighth. WEST GLACIER drifted out
some to jostle briefly with I LUV THIS BAR leaving the chute, was settled at the back, picked up her pace along the rail leaving the turn, came off the rail
some for a clear path into the lane, passed between tired rivals upper stretch then leveled off. GUEST IN MY HEART in contention early, was three to five
wide taking the bend then flattened out for the drive. MARYS LAST SONG was forwardly placed running widest but gave way the last two furlongs. REND
LAKE BABY stumbled at the break, lugged in some to jostle briefly with CAROLINA BEAST, quickly recovered to gain a clear lead, was overtaken from
outside on the turn and faltered the final quarter mile.

Footnotes
DIAMOND MAXIMUS bumped with DURANGO KID leaving the chute, was settled outside, commenced his bid just off the rail on the turn, split rivals leaving
the bend, rallied two wide to split horses again with a sixteenth left and edged ahead in the waning yards. BEEMIE AWARD raced in the second flight just
off the inside, moved clear on the turn, was under a drive in the lane, drifted out as he wore down deep stretch and was outfinished. MIND TRAPPE well
placed inside from the early going, rallied to loom a serious threat with a furlong to go but lacked the extra needed in the late going. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE
prominent from outside on the backstretch, was crowded by SUNNY'S STORM nearing the turn, lost consider ground five wide through the bend and rallied
belatedly deep stretch. SUNNY'S STORM also bumped with DURANGO KID leaving the chute, was boxed in behind the leader on the backstretch, angled
out some trying to gain a clear path nearing the bend and brushed with KHOZAN'S VALENTINE, was four wide taking the turn then weakened for the drive.
MIAS MOONBEAM failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. COUSIN DARIO displayed early speed between rivals but began to tire three wide before
finishing a half mile. DURANGO KID was squeezed and steadied back leaving the chute, recovered to race in contention on the backstretch but faded three
wide into the turn, proved unresponsive upper stretch, was eased the last furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
DAYJUR BEST showed first and was urged clear, had the rail on the turn, drifted out to path three entering the lane, was under a steady drive the last
furlong and held on. FAIRWAY LANE without early speed from outside, lost considerable ground five then six wide through the bend, was closing in on the
weakening leader deep stretch, came up short but caught W W RUSSIAN GOLD for second. W W RUSSIAN GOLD pressed from outside, was bumped
with a half mile to go, took over second three wide leaving the turn, fanned out some for the drive and was also getting to the leader deep stretch.
ABSTRACT PAYNTER chased from just off the inside, altered out three wide for a clear path with two furlongs to go and rallied belatedly from between
horses the final furlong. HOUSE OF CORTEZ was checked when his path was taken by RAMBLINGRUDYRAGS midway on the backstretch, two wide
through the turn and showed a willingness to run the last eighth. CONSPICUOUS BOX chased while toward the outside, moved up to contention four wide
on the bend, fanned out some for the drive and made up minor ground late. RAMBLINGRUDYRAGS boxed in behind the leader early, altered out midway
on the backstretch, bumped W W RUSSIAN GOLD, was two wide on the turn, angled in for a clear path leaving the bend and flattened out in the lane. LT
DAN ATTACK was hustled along from inside to be a factor on the backstretch but gave way on the bend.
