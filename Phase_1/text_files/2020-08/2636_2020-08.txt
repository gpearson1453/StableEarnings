LET'S GO BABY stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, made a steady gain
and drew off late. LOOPY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased her margin down the backstretch, turned back a challenged into the stretch,
shook clear, then was no match for the winner and held the place safe. RIPROARING fractious in the gate, reared and broke awkwardly at the start, looped
up two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and edged up for the show. HER NAME IS STAR ran evenly. VINDICTA allowed

saved ground through the turn, then had no stretch rally. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE, DETERMINED RIPROARING DID

HOLY TRUTH well placed and inside, moved up to gain a short leads through the turn, shook clear in the lane, then lasted under steady pressure.
CATZALIONBYTHETALE mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, made a
steady gain and missed. FRENCH KISS ME never far back, looped to position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out.

Footnotes
OH MY PRECIOUS well placed and inside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, gained a short lead, then
drew off late and was kept to the task. LOOKIN PERFECT allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane,
angled out late and closed well for the place. COUNTRY THUNDER allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch and got up for the show. COZAR'S QUEEN rushed up to set the pace inside, drew off through the turn, then weakened late and held a share.
TORNERO well placed and outside, held position three and four wide through the turn, bid five wide into the lane and weakened late. ACE QUEEN mid
pack, moved up while angling out through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and weakened. CONTROLLINGTHEGOLD mid pack, looped two and
three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and weakened in the drive. GUCCIGUCCIGIRL mid pack, looped four wide through the turn, fanned
widest into the lane and could not gain. MUD CAT fractious in the gate, hopped at the start and was no factor. GO GIRL GONE stalked the pace on the
outside, lost some ground through the turn, then faded in the lane.
