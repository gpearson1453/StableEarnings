Footnotes
PROBABLY GRACE was placed on the lead inside of KENAI COOL, saved ground and set the pace while pressured by that foe, responded when pushed
along past the quarter pole, began to open up in upper stretch, drew away further when driven in midstretch, and held well clear while in hand late. KENAI
COOL pressed the pace outside of PROBABLY GRACE, proved no match for PROBABLY GRACE past the quarter pole, chased on under a drive in the
lane and proved second best. REJOICE AN BE GLAD settled at the inside of the rear pair, was pushed along while saving ground through the turn, rallied
between the rail and MCKINLI'SBABYBLUES into the lane, and chased the top pair without being able to reel them in under a drive in the lane. ANGEL'S
RUN settled two wide in the rear pair, continued two wide around the turn, went to a drive past the three eighths, came three wide into the lane, and chased
under a drive while ultimately no threat to the top three. MCKINLI'SBABYBLUES chased well off the leading pair, was pushed along in the three path on the
turn, came into the lane between horses and came up empty.

Footnotes
OUR THOMAS was away from the gate slowly, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, entered the stretch still in last place and
showed an explosive turn of foot in the final sixteenth of a mile to get up for the win on the outside. ED'S ROCKET pressed the pace on the inside up the
backstretch, dropped back headed into the turn, launched a second bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole, gained ground between horses in
upper stretch, drifted out and bumped mildly with POWER CRY at the sixteenth pole and was caught late. LONG STATION raced in the middle of the pack
on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and improved position from the rail in the stretch. RIV raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began to move up approaching the three eighths pole, entered the stretch in striking position from the three
path and was outkicked in the final furlong. POWER CRY veered out leaving the gate, angled in to lead the field up the backstretch, saved ground while still
showing the way around the turn was bumped slightly near the sixteenth pole when EDS ROCKET drifted into him and weakened in the final furlong.
GORGEOUS GEORGE was forced out slightly by leaving the gate, angled in to race at the back of the pack up the backstretch, raced in the three path
around the turn and offered no bid.

MOM'S RED LIPSTICK hopped at the start and hit the gate as she broke outward, settled at the rear, was shaken up near the three eighths, responded well
with a rally in the five path through the far turn, came four wide into the lane, blew past at the three sixteenths, kicked clear under a drive, and held sway.
MAGICALLY HONORED broke outward and bumped soundly with TITAN'S TREASURE, settled near the rear, took closer order approaching the far turn,
continued in the four path at the rear of a compact field through that bend, swung five wide into the lane, rallied under a drive, and proved second best.
SUMMER DAY tracked the leading pair through the first turn, advanced keenly on the backstretch to track the leader inside of TITAN'S TREASURE,
continued in range while saving ground through the far turn, tried to get through between TIZ SUSAN ANN and the rail into the lane but tossed her head and
took back, came through inside tiring foes near the furlong mark and chased on to the wire. TITAN'S TREASURE broke in and bumped soundly with
MAGICALLY HONORED, was keen to dispute the pace outside of TIZ SUSAN ANN early, took back to track the leader into the first turn, tracked the pace
outside of SUMMER DAY down the backstretch, bid outside of TIZ SUSAN ANN on the far turn, came into the stretch three wide between horses, proved no
match for the winner into the lane and weakened in the final furlong. TIZ SUSAN ANN soon disputed the pace inside of TITAN'S TREASURE, shook clear to
a distinct lead into the clubhouse turn, carried the lead down the backstretch and in the two path on the far turn, was confronted near the quarter pole, went
to a drive but was headed by the winner near the three sixteenths and weakened.

BARRISTER TOM led the field from the two path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, relinquished the lead from the two path
around the far turn, re rallied between horses in the stretch and drew off in the final furlong. DEWY'S HIT saved ground around the first turn, raced off the
pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the second turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground on the
outside in the stretch. THE RIGHT STUFF (GB) fought his rider while saving ground around the first turn, was allowed to move up on the leader entering the
backstretch, dueled for the lead on the inside while still showing signs of rankness, took over the lead from the rail headed into the far turn and weakened in
the final furlong. CITADEL hopped up leaving the gate, trailed the field from the two path around the first turn, was checked hard by his rider entering the
backstretch, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack, improved position mildly while saving ground around the far turn and flattened out in the
stretch. PHRASEOLOGISM raced in the two path at the back of the pack around both turns and up the backstretch, and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
MERLIN'S SONG cleared to lead into the first turn, set the pace down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, drifted out in the lane despite a right
handed crop but kept on well and widened in the final furlong. U S DELTA FORCE bobbled out of the gate, advanced to track two wide through the first turn,
stalked the leader down the backstretch, was pushed along in the three path through the far turn, continued to chase MERLIN'S SONG into the lane but
proved no match in the final furlong. EKATERINOSLAV settled near the rear through the first turn, took closer order to chase three wide down the
backstretch and into the second turn, swung into the lane in the four to vie path under a drive, proved no match for the leading pair but finished best of the
rest. TORNADO BOY was fractious in the gate and taken to the rear early, trailed through the first turn and down the backstretch, took closer order in the
five to six path through the far turn, swung into the lane in the seven path, and chased while proving no threat. VIOLATOR tracked inside of U S DELTA
FORCE while racing rank through the clubhouse turn, settled at the inside of the chasing flight for the backstretch run and into the far turn, was urged along
the inside into the lane but had no rally. MISTER CHARMING chased midpack early, raced between horses in the chasing flight down the backstretch and
into the far turn, began to fade while urged between horses from the five sixteenths, and had no more for the drive.

Footnotes
NORTHERN ALLIANCE saved ground around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, launched a bold bid at the quarter
pole while four wide, and gained ground on the outside to take command. CHLOBEE raced in the two path around the first turn, settled near the pace up the
backstretch, began her bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced in the three path around the second turn and improved position in the stretch.
TROPHY BRIDLE raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack, came around the far turn in the two path,
ran into traffic entering the stretch, swung out to find racing room, and gained ground rapidly in the final furlong. COOK MEMORIES chased the leader while
saving ground through the opening half mile, moved up to challenge from the two path nearing the five sixteenths pole, and weakened while drifting out
slightly in the stretch. REAL DE JALPA saved ground around the first turn, race on the inside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, continued to save
ground around the far turn and was outkicked in the stretch. WILDWOOD SCAT raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the
middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and made no bid. STRAIGHT UP SMARTY was pushed for the lead into the first
turn, led the field from the rail through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch. LITTLE CHICK hit the gate
at the break, was away slowly, trailed far behind the field the entire way around the oval and was never a factor.

Footnotes
WORLD TAX WAR (IRE) settled two wide toward the rear through the first turn, raced two wide in the chasing flight down the backstretch, rallied inside foes
past the half mile mark, switched out and engaged outside of PHARAOH'S KITTEN past the quarter pole, vied two wide in upper stretch, took the lead
approaching the sixteenth pole and edged clear. PHARAOH'S KITTEN was anxious in the gate, made the lead inside into the first turn, disputed the pace
inside foes past the three quarters, edged clear of the pressers past the half mile pole, set the pace in the two path through the far turn, was engaged by
WORLD TAX WAR to his outside past the quarter pole, vied inside that foe but could not keep pace with him in the final sixteenth. KALININGRAD settled
toward the rear inside of WORLD TAX WAR through the first turn, continued at the inside of the chasing flight down the backstretch, came out for a bid in
the five path on the far turn, came into the lane three wide under a drive, and chased on while proving no match for the top two. OFF TO THE BEACH
tracked between horses on the clubhouse turn, advanced past the three quarters to dispute the pace three wide, was outpaced by PHARAOH'S KITTEN
into the far turn, chased three wide around that bend, came into the lane between horses, and was no further threat. Z U NOW trailed after breaking a step
slowly, continued well off the pace in the two path through the far turn, was driven in the three path to the lane, and lacked the needed rally. MAGIC JACK
raced midfield in the opening furlong, pulled hard to join the tracking flight inside of OFF TO THE BEACH into the clubhouse turn, advanced to dispute the
pace between horses past the three quarters, could not keep up with PHARAOH'S KITTEN into the far turn, flattened out between horses from the three
eighths and was empty in the lane. ROCKET RIDE tracked the pace three wide on the clubhouse turn, began to gradually lose ground from near the three
quarters, continued to fade in the four path on the far turn and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
TOUGH STUFF was bumped and squeezed between horses leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, and held off the late closers while drifting out in the stretch. TRAPPE VALLEY tracked the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in
the two path around the turn, began his bid passing the quarter pole, was brushed and forced out mildly near the sixteenth pole when TOUGH STUFF
drifted into his lane, and wore down the margin on the winner through the stretch but couldn't get by. CAN'T HIDE FROM ME was pinched back leaving the
gate, began to move up on the outside headed into the turn, raced in the three path around the turn and improved position on the inside in the stretch.
LIBERAL LUNACY raced on the outside at the back of the pack early, navigated the turn from the three path and gained ground on the outside in late
stretch. RIP IT RYAN trailed the field up the backstretch, began to improve position while saving ground around the turn and was outkicked in the final
furlong. TAKAFUMI (BRZ) raced inside in the early stages, saved ground around the turn, entered the stretch between horses and faded from there. TAK
chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back after a quarter of a mile had been run, raced in the two path around the turn and ran on
again in the stretch to finish evenly. BUSHROD hopped up and then bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced between horses at the
back of the pack early, navigated the turn from the three path and came up empty in the stretch. JACK VAN BERG raced inside in the middle of the pack
through the opening stages, came around the turn in the two path and tired in the stretch. SPEIGHTSONG raced inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and offered no bid.
