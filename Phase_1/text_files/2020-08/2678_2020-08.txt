went four wide into the turn, was no match and finished second best. DELBERT TOO was allowed to settle early, went seven wide and offered a mild rally.
DIGGER'S GOLD was reserved early, went six wide into the turn and finished belatedly. FILL THE BILL raced in mid pack early, went three wide and was
empty late. COMING ABSTRACTION was taken back early, raced between rivals and never fired. IMA SAINT TOO was unhurried and was never a threat.
MISS LUBBOCK tracked the early pace, went five wide and faded. SI CAPITAN MG was no factor. FUEGO Y FURIA was always outrun.

BULLY BABY set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail, opened up and held for the win. AISLE RUNNER pressed the early pace, went four wide into the
turn, was no match late and finished second best. QUATRO was taken back early, loomed eight wide and was evenly late. DAN WHO was outrun early,
went five wide into the turn, angled out and was gaining. PUB was allowed to settle, went six wide and offered no late rally. SILVER PONZI was not far
back, went seven wide and was empty. ONE MARK was unhurried early, raced between rivals and never fired. STORMIN TEXASON was allowed to settle
from the inside and faded. BEALRIGHT GINGER never in contention. STORM TRACK raced in mid pack and retreated.
