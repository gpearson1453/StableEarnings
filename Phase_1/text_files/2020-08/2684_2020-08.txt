the stretch drive. SHE'S FOREVER was bothered early on, set the pace, was overtaken near the quarter pole, raced off the rail into the lane and gave way
in the stretch. RAPID WATER was a bit slow from the gate and trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
QUEENS EMPIRE (IRE) was off slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, searched for racing room in the two to three path around the far turn before cutting
the corner turning for home, then shifted off of the rail again in upper stretch to split the leaders three wide, surged between rivals with a quick blitz at the
sixteenth pole, and won going away. WILSHIRE DIAMOND advanced four wide around the first turn a stalking position, produced a three wide bid for the
lead at the quarter pole, forged an advantage in upper stretch, but drifted outwards while holding that margin at the furlong pole, then was bested by an
inner surging foe. OLD SOT stalked two wide, waited behind the leading group as WILSHIRE DIAMOND kept him hemmed in through the far turn, waited
for room turning for home before shifting for wide in upper stretch, but only produced a mild kick before shifting inside of the drifting aforementioned rival.
FAST RECOVERY saved ground in midpack around the first turn, shifted from the two to the five path turning for home, then stayed on mildly. STOP
MAKING SENSE prompted the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, but was outkicked by outer foes in upper stretch, and tired. SUPERCELL tracked
from off of the pace two to four wide around the turns before shifting six wide turning for home, and failed to factor. JUST GUN IT raced far off of the pace
two to five wide and never got involved. GALILEO'S ROCK broke sharply and set the pace along the inside, but faltered in upper stretch. NOBLE
COMPANION stalked along the inside, but weakened into the far turn, was eased thereafter, and galloped across the wire.
