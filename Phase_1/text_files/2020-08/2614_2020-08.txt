WAR ACT rated off of the pace two wide, rallied while shifting from the four to five path at the quarter pole, then blew past the inner leader at the furlong
pole while under hand urging, and drew off. PAPAJUDGY hopped at the start but recovered and rushed to set the pace along the inside, held an advantage
turning for home, but was headed by WAR ACT passing the furlong pole, and was second best. REELFOOT saved ground off of the pace, trailed turning for
home, shifting to the five path in midstretch, and passed tired foes for a minor reward. NOT NOW RAND stalked three wide and between horses, but
weakened turning for home. BOOM FIVE THOUSAND stalked four wide, but was outmoved by an outer foe turning for home, then weakened after the rider
lost the whip near the three-sixteenths pole. STORMY CACTUSA chased two wide, but failed to keep pace at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
JOE COOL quickly cleared off, opened up on the the field into the turn, then responded when roused in upper stretch, and widened under driving pressure.
BENNY BOO BOO saved ground in midpack into the turn, but was shuffled back behind CAN'T SAY ELLY MAE through the turn to trail the field, shifted to
the three path turning for home for clear racing room, then rallied between foes through the lane under hand urging to prove second best. VOLACIOUS
tracked from midpack two wide, dropped back to be far off of the pace through the turn, then stayed on along the inside of tiring foes for a minor reward.
HENRY RULES broke outwards and was forwardly placed three wide, but proved no match for the clear leader into the turn, held place to the furlong pole,
but weakened through the late stages. ROYAL ICING was off a step slowly, advanced mildly four wide around the turn, but failed to sustain a bid and
flattened out in upper stretch. CAN'T SAY ELLY MAE chased the loose leader two wide, but weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole, and was done
early.

BETTER WATCH OUT trailed early on, advanced past inner rivals into the turn to stalk the pace three wide, inched forward turning for home to vie for the
lead outside of the leader, forged an advantage at the furlong pole, then cleared off late. BETTER CHARGE IT set the pace two wide, dug in to hold an
advantage from BETTER WATCH OUT in upper stretch, but was headed by that foe at the furlong pole, then gave way late. BALANDEEN tracked from off
of the pace two wide, advanced in the four path around the turn, but flattened out in upper stretch. RESTORING HOPE saved ground while trailing around
the turn, shifted two wide at the quarter pole to pass a tiring foe, then failed to menace along the rail through the lane. POLE SETTER pressed the pace
setter from along the inside, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole, and stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
PARKER prompted the pace two wide, inched closer to the clear leader turning for home, blew past the tiring pace setter in upper stretch, drew clear, and
was kept to task to the wire. SUDDEN SHIFT advanced from off of the pace three wide around the turn, then stayed on past the tiring pace setter to prove
second best. GOOSING set the pace and held a clear margin along the inside around the turn, but was no match for PARKER in upper stretch, and
weakened through the lane. PUNKSTER bobbled a bit at the start, saved ground far off of the pace around the turn, and passed tired foes through the lane.
BENNY'S LEGACY chased the pace along the inside, but weakened into and around the turn. HE'S NAUGHTY raced off of the pace along the inside down
the backstretch, but failed to factor. INDY REBEL dwelt at the start and trailed the field down the backstretch, took the turn in the three to four path and
never got involved. Following the race, a Stewards' Inquiry deemed INDY REBEL caused his own trouble at the start.

Footnotes
LISA'S LEGACY raced close up to the pace along the inside, saved ground right behind the leaders around the turn, shifted three wide in midstretch, and
rallied to produce a bid at the sixteenth pole, shifted in a bit from right handed pressure, but then came out multiple paths when corrected, but sustained her
rally to edge an advantage approaching the wire. MISHPOCHA dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, battled gamely through the lane, but was
outfinished by an outer oncharging foe in the final sixteenth while prevailing over her inner game foe for place. GOLDEN VOICE dueled for the lead inside of
a pair of foes around the turn, battled gamely through the lane, but was outfinished in the final sixteenth. SOVEREIGN POWER saved ground in midpack
around the turn, tipped four wide turning for home, then five wide in midstretch, produced a rally, lugged inwards inside the final sixteenth and shied
outwards from an inner rival, then stayed on, but missed place. AMERICAN VIOLET leaned against the gate when it opened, raced far off of the pace two
wide around the turn, then stayed on mildly to cut the gap on the leaders through the lane. SHES MY TREASURE was forwardly placed two wide and
between horses, shifted three wide outside of the leaders turning for home, but lacked a kick before tiring. PLEADTHEFIFTH saved ground far off of the
pace, but to no avail. BE PATIENT had a bit of a slow start, advanced from off of the pace four wide passing the seven sixteenths pole, achieved striking
position into the turn, then weakened when floated five wide turning for home. LINK IN FRONT prompted the pace three wide, but weakened when floated
four wide turning for home, and stopped through the lane. Due to a timer malfunction, the half mile time was omitted.

Footnotes
CHARGAREE stalked three wide, took over from inner foes turning for home and drew clear in upper stretch, but flopped back to her left lead when the rider
switched to right handed pressure at the sixteenth pole, then tired, but held. CUBBIE BEAR set the pace two wide, dueled for the lead outside of a foe at the
half mile pole, forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, but was headed by CHARGAREE at the quarter pole, shifted outside of that foe in upper
stretch, came again as that rival tired in the final sixteenth, but was second best. HOPPESTRY was off slowly, tracked from midpack along the inside, split
foes in upper stretch to produce a show bid inside of NIECE JACKIE DAVIS, and prevailed over that foe for that position. NIECE JACKIE DAVIS chased the
pace four wide in midpack around the turn, and was outdueled by an inner foe for show. QUITE A BABE was never involved. POLARIZING pressed the
pace along the inside before dueling for the lead approaching the half mile pole, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole. RICKI was no factor.

Footnotes
DAAHER STREET took a bump from COMPLEX JUSTICE while in the five path into the first turn, shifted down to the three path while stalking around the
first turn, inched closer three wide between horses to vie for the lead into the backstretch as IT'S THE SUNRISE forced his hand, held an advantage two
wide around the far turn, then kicked clear in upper stretch and won going away. CLEARING WAIVERS hopped at the start, tracked from midpack two wide,
rallied three wide into the far turn to bid for the lead turning for home, but was repelled by the leader in upper stretch, and proved second best. BOAT
WAMPUM trailed along the inside early on, then shifted to the three path turning for home, and improved past tired foes to dead heat for show. IT'S THE
SUNRISE stalked in the six to four path around the first turn before inching forward to vie for the lead four wide into the backstretch, but failed to keep pace
with a pair of inner foes into the far turn, and subsequently tired, then dead heated for show. COMPLEX JUSTICE bumped an outer foe into the first turn
while pulling his way to vie for the lead two wide and between horses, held a narrow advantage inside of a pair of foes at the half mile pole, but was headed
by the eventual winner into the far turn, then weakened at the five sixteenths pole. REED O'PRADO prompted the pace along the inside around the first
turn, took back to stalk into the backstretch, but weakened into the far turn. SQUATTER was done early, and eased.

MILLION DOLLAR RED raced off of the pace in the two path around the first turn, shifted to the four path into the backstretch, advanced into the far turn to
surge past the leaders at the three furlong pole, quickly cleared around the far turn, and held sway under driving pressure through the lane. FEVER
TEMPLE was squeezed back at the start, saved ground far off of the pace along the inside around the first turn, progressed five wide into and around the far
turn, then sustained the bid through the lane while chasing the clear leader home. COMES N THREES saved ground while trailing around the first turn,
advanced inside of rivals to be midpack into the far turn, shifted to the three path turning for home, and rallied between horses to forge show in midstretch.
LEADING THE CHARGE stalked along the inside around the far turn, shifted to the three path inside of MILLION DOLLAR RED down the backstretch, but
was outmoved by that foe into the far turn, shuffled behind tiring pace setters around that bend, then shifted to the four path turning for home, and finished
up evenly. MAJOR SPARKS raced far off of the pace two wide, then four wide, around the turns, and stayed on mildly. VICTOR'S DEAL saved ground far
off of the pace early on, shifted two wide into the backstretch, steadied in tight quarters at the half mile pole, recovered and rallied in the six path around the
far turn, but leveled off through the lane. PROUD N FAMOUS vied for the lead along the inside, but proved no match for the eventual winner into the far
turn, and weakened in upper stretch. THE STORY BEGINS pulled from midpack to make a four wide bid for the lead into the backstretch, but weakened into
the far turn. ALTERNATE NIGHTS raced far off of the pace three wide around the first turn, saved ground around the far turn, but failed to factor. PREPARE
FOR GLORY saved ground in midpack around the first turn, shifted two wide down the backstretch, but weakened into the far turn. PRETTY BOY DAVE
was forwardly placed two wide, but weakened between horses into the far turn. EL BOHEMIO set the pace two wide, but weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
JACKSONS GOLD saved ground far off of the pace around both turns, waited patiently behind rivals turning for home, shifted to the three path in upper
stretch, then to the six path approaching the furlong pole, and produced a solid late kick to get up approaching the wire. KINZEA STONE saved ground far
off of the pace around the first turn, rallied five wide around the far turn to produce a bid inside the furlong pole, but was outfinished by an outer oncharging
rival, and prevailed for place. CHARCOAL dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, drew clear passing the three sixteenths pole, dug in to hold an
advantage while shifting to the two path at the furlong pole, but was outfinished by outer oncharging rivals in the final stages. ARABIAN STORY saved
ground in midpack around the first turn, split tiring foes two wide into the far turn, then shifted back to the rail in midstretch, but failed to produce a bid. REDS
BEST advanced from midpack four wide into the far turn, achieved striking position, but flattened out turning for home, then weakened on his left lead.
PERFECT SEEKER dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch before weakening
between horses through the final furlong. MR SUPERB stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid and weakened in upper stretch. CLASSIC SKY
raced far off of the pace in the three path and never got involved. MOON MISSION rushed after a lack luster beginning to duel for the lead three wide, but
weakened into the far turn. LOUWIT trailed early on, was distanced down the backstretch, and eased thereafter and galloped across the wire.
