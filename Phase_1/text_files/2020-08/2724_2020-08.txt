Footnotes
FROST OR FRIPPERY prompted the pace two wide, took over from his inner counterpart passing the quarter pole, and drew off under vigorous hand urging
through the lane. ZANESVILLE raced off of the pace two wide, then took the far turn in the three to four path before rallying outside of foes through the lane
to get up for place at the wire. BLUE STEEL set the pace along the inside with the eventual winner off his outer flank down the backstretch, but proved no
match for that foe passing the quarter pole, then weakened and was nailed for place on the wire. ESKENDEREYAS DREAM saved ground in midpack
around the first turn, pulled keenly at the three quarter pole, but settled half a furlong later, stalked the leaders before chasing them in the three path around
the far turn, then failed to produce a bid before tiring. WILD ABOUT YOU trailed throughout and was outrun.

Footnotes
G AS IN GEORGE broke outwards and bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace three to two wide, forged an advantage at the five
sixteenths pole before drawing clear in upper stretch, then widened under driving pressure. C J'S I'M BYU raced far off of the pace, shifted two wide turning
for home, rallied and split foes at the sixteenth pole, then surged inside of SHOTGUN JUSTICE to achieve place. SHOTGUN JUSTICE advanced from
midpack under urging to chase the pair of leaders from the three path around the turn, produced a three wide bid for the lead turning for home, but quickly
proved no match for the leader in upper stretch, then kept on but lost place inside the final sixteenth. CHUY chased the pace from the two path while inside
of a foe around the turn, but failed to produce a bid. FHACO was pinched back between horses at the start, trailed the field in the four path around the turn,
and failed to factor. TALK FAST set the pace along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened in upper
stretch. HEZA GLITTER bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased from midpack along the inside, but weakened at the seven sixteenths pole, and was
done early.

HELP ME OUT stalked the pair of dueling leaders from the three path around the turn, swept past those foes passing the quarter pole, then was kept to task
through the lane to hold her margin from her inner game rival. MYERS TIGER pressed the pace setter along the inside, dueled with that foe around the turn,
but was headed by the surging HELP ME OUT at the quarter pole, dug in turning for home while conceding the lead to that foe, then kept on through the
lane` but failed to regain even terms and was second best. FORBIDDEN FRUIT was bumped by an inner foe and stumbled at the start, raced off of the pace
in the four path around the turn, then stayed on through the lane to prevail for show. SANDY'S NEWSGIRL dueled for the lead two wide around the turn, but
weakened between horses passing the quarter pole. GOT SPIRIT shook her head when the gates opened and was away awkwardly , raced off of the pace
along the inside before shifting to the three path in upper stretch, but failed to factor. EXPRESS LADY trailed in the five path around the turn, and was
outrun. FRENCH VANILLA bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace three wide and between horses, but weakened when her blinkers
slipped loose into the turn, then was put back to a drive when trailing turning for home after the blinkers stabilized themselves, but failed to rerally.

DANCE MONEY set the pace along the inside, dueled for the lead inside of ROYAL TO BE around the turn before shaking free from that foe in upper
stretch, drew clear, then held SWEET JUSTICE's late bid at bay under driving pressure. SWEET JUSTICE stalked the pace along the inside, saved ground
before forging place from outer foes at the furlong pole, then sustained a grinding rally outside of the loose leader, bid approaching the wire, but did not have
enough. CORSIDAT tracked from midpack in the three to four path around the turn, then failed to produce a bid while staying on for a mild reward. ALLIE
MAES REVENGE raced far off of the pace in the four path around the turn, then lugged inwards in upper stretch due to hanging on her left lead, but still
produced a mild rally inside of foes to miss show on the wire. ROYAL TO BE was off a step slow, rushed past inner foes to bid for the lead two wide at the
seven sixteenths pole, dueled outside of DANCE MONEY around the turn, but failed to keep pace with that foe while drifting out in upper stretch, then
weakened between horses on her left lead in midstretch. RHAPSODY IN GREY broke inward, trailed, and was outrun.

Footnotes
BEER CAN MAN dueled along the inside of HEART RYTHMS through a moderate pace as they opened up on the rest of the field down the backstretch,
held a narrow margin from that rival turning for home before inching clear passing the furlong pole, then held TRADE DEAL's late surge at bay. TRADE
DEAL stalked the pace two wide multiple lengths off of the dueling leaders, rallied in upper stretch, but drifted out when the rider switched to left handed
pressure inside the furlong pole, straightened and surged late, but ran out of ground. HEART RHYTHM dueled for the lead outside of BEER CAN MAN
through a moderate pace, but failed to keep pace with that foe at the furlong pole, and was outfinished by an outer foe for place. CHICKEN TRUCK raced
far off of the pace along the inside, came into the lane two wide, and finished up evenly without threatening. BAYTOWN JAXX chased along the inside, but
tired through the lane. BAD NEWS was outrun. HOME TEAM took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path
around the turn, and failed to factor before weakening.

VOODOO JUSTICE dueled for the lead three wide early on, cleared off into the turn and shifted inwards, then widened his advantage in upper stretch under
driving pressure before being geared down approaching the wire. TAP THE LINE dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals early on, but took back at the
seven sixteenths pole, stalked the loose leader two wide around the turn, forged place from outer foes approaching the quarter pole, and proved second
best. TIMELESS GLORY tracked from midpack two wide, rallied four wide at the five sixteenths pole to produce a bid for place turning for home, but leveled
off in upper stretch. THE UPS DID IT bumped and stumbled at the start, chased the dueling leaders from along the inside, then saved ground around the
turn and failed to threaten, then was vanned off. A TOUCH OF JUSTICE stumbled at the start, trailed early on, and never got involved. PASSING ON BY
brushed an inner foe at the start, dueled for the lead two wide and between horses early on, but failed to keep pace with those foes passing the half mile
pole. stalked two to three wide into the turn as the leader cleared off, but weakened between horses turning for home. MAMBACITA was bumped between

UNMOORED vied two wide and between horses early on, took back and stalked along the inside around the turn, but was blocked behind the leaders while
shifting to the two path turning for home, waited for racing room before shifting in at the furlong pole, and surged inside of foes to win going away. EQUAL
JUSTICE raced far off of the pace in the three path around the turn before rallying five wide at the quarter pole, shifted four wide turning for home, then
sustained his grind through the lane to achieve place. BOA NOVA (IRE) vied for the lead five wide, stalked three wide around the turn before bidding for the
lead turning for home, was no match for an inner surging foe passing the furlong pole, then was nailed on the wire by an outer foe for place. ROLIN WITH
OLIN vied three wide, dueled two wide around the turn, dug in gamely between horses in upper stretch, but was bested by an inner foe inside the final
furlong, then got nailed by multiple outer foes on the wire for minor rewards. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE saved ground off of the pace around the turn before
coming into the lane in the three path and behind the leaders, stayed blocked behind those foes through the lane before inching too close to BOA NOVA
(IRE) approaching the furlong pole, clipped heels with that foe inside that marker, then was protected by the rider thereafter. SATURDAY TRYST chased
the pace four to two wide, but weakened between horses turning for home. CAPTURE THE GLORY was off slowly and never got involved. BUTTER HUT
broke inwards, then rushed along the inside to duel for the lead, but was headed by multiple foes turning for home, then weakened on her left lead in upper
stretch. Following a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run, no change was made to the original order of finish

to continue to vie in upper stretch, but was bested at the furlong pole, and held place through the late stages. SHADOW OF JUSTICE stalked the pace in
the four path, bid for the lead outside of a pair of foes while still in the four path at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with them in upper stretch.
SPOTLIGHT JUSTICE raced far off of the pace, advanced two wide around the far turn, but failed to menace. TWISTED MIRACLE was outrun. CODE OF

Footnotes
WHY WHY PAUL WHY vied two wide, cleared STURGILL approaching the five furlong pole and held a loose lead down the backstretch. then held that foe's
rebid at bay through the far turn before spurting clear again in upper stretch, and widened under driving pressure. PAINISMYGAIN saved ground around the
turns while off of the pace, and produced a mild rally along the rail to prevail for place passing the sixteenth pole. MY BOY BLUE stalked the pace three
wide around both turns, but proved no match for the leader in upper stretch, then got outfinished by an inner closing rival for place at the sixteenth pole. ALL
REVVED UP trailed in the two to four path around the turns and failed to factor. STURGILL set the pace along the inside into the first turn, pulled in the bit
while being restrained back around that bend, shifted outside of the leader and stalked before rebidding for the lead two wide at the three furlong pole, vied
around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch.
