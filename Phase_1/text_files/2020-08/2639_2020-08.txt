Footnotes
CAMMACK chased while saving ground through the first turn, continued to chased at the middle of a compact field down the backstretch, raced in the
pocket in the two path on the far turn, was pushed along approaching the five sixteenths and willingly split between WHAT'S UP DUDE and the rail, led with
a quarter mile remaining, took command in upper stretch, and held safe despite drifting out. MEMORY BANK tracked the leader inside of CHANGI early,
advanced to prompt inside of WHAT'S UP DUDE into the first turn, switched out behind what foe into the backstretch and reengaged to press the pace to
his outside, attended the pace outside WHAT'S UP DUDE in the four path on the far turn, was pushed along three wide in the leading flight into the lane, did
not match CAMMACK's kick into upper stretch, but kept on earnestly to hold the place. SIR ANTHONY settled at the rear inside of BLUE SKY KOWBOY for
the run through the clubhouse turn, continued in the rear flight between horses on the backstretch, was pushed along into the far turn and began to improve
in the three path, came into the lane two wide behind the leading flight, and rallied between horses in the final furlong. BLUE SKY KOWBOY settled in the
rear pair two wide through the clubhouse turn, continued three wide at the rear down the backstretch, brought up the rear of the compact field in the four
path on the far turn, swung four wide into the lane, rallied under a drive outside horses and narrowly missed the show. CHANGI tracked the leader early,
settled to chase two wide into the clubhouse turn, continued to chase outside of CAMMACK down the backstretch and in the five path on the far turn, came
into the lane four wide, chased all out in the lane, showed interest to the wire but was outkicked between horses. WHAT'S UP DUDE broke sharp and
cleared to the early lead, took some pressure from MEMORY BANK to his inside near the seven furlong mark, inched forward to a clear lead again around
the bend, was reengaged from the outside by MEMORY BANK after that foe switched out into the backstretch, was pushed along to maintain his lead past
the half mile mark, continued to set a pressured pace in the three path on the far turn, got headed at the quarter pole and weakened inside horses down the
lane.

Footnotes
LADY MAGNA pressed the pace on the outside early, moved up to challenge entering the turn, took command from the two path near the quarter pole and
drew away in the stretch. RARE ACTION ATTACK bumped mildly with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the rail up
the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, began a bid passing the five sixteenths pole and gained ground while drifting out in the stretch.
AMAZING ANNIE raced inside off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path, was forced out some in upper
stretch when RARE ACTION ATTACK drifted into her lane and gained ground late. SHARPERTHANME raced outside in the middle of the pack up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and made a mild improvement on the outside in the stretch. I DON'T WANT TO GO bumped with the
horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the final
furlong. DETOUR raced between horses early, pressed the pace headed into the turn, raced in the three path from there and faded in the stretch.
GODSGIFT raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid in the stretch. RANGOON ATTACK
trailed the field the entire way around the oval, and despite saving ground around the turn, was never a factor.

NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) was pushed to the lead inside horses, vied inside of POWER CRY down the backstretch and while saving ground through the
turn, edged clear into the lane, and steadily drew off while being ridden out and shown the crop. WELOVECANDY was sandwiched between POWER CRY
and MONGOL BULL in the opening strides, improved into the turn to chase the leading pair inside of MONGOL BULL, improved position inside horses in
upper stretch, was bumped midstretch by POWER CRY, and kept on under a drive well enough to hold the place. ONE WAY HOME raced two wide near
the rear early, continued at the rear in the three path on the turn, improved outside of tiring horses late but missed the place. MONGOL BULL broke inward
and bumped WELOVECANDY in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch, continued to chase the leading pair two wide on the
turn, began to be pushed along near the three eighths, kept on three wide to midstretch, and emptied out in the final furlong. POWER CRY broke out and
bumped WELOVECANDY, was pushed along to dispute the pace outside of NEVER HAVE I EVER, proved no match for that foe past the quarter pole,
flattened between horses down the stretch, bumped WELOVECANDY midstretch, and continued to weaken. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE
HALF MILE FRACTION IS UNAVAILABLE.

around the turn and opened up from there while being kept to the task. HEY HEY stalked the frontrunners on the outside early, saved ground around the
turn, began a bid at the quarter pole and chased the winner home, never threatening. TINDERELLA chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn, and made mild improvement in late stretch. BIT MONEY bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced off the
pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and gained some ground on the outside in the final sixteenth of a mile.
DANCE trailed well behind the field through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. R MARIE
dueled for the lead on the outside early, raced in the two path around the turn and flattened out in the stretch. COUNTESS ST MICHEL raced in the middle
of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and faded in the stretch. COOK MEMORIES raced off the pace on the

Footnotes
SKY FREAK broke out and bumped LITTLE CHICK in the opening strides, chased well behind the leading pair, was pushed along in the two path on the far
turn and rallied, engaged outside of OF NOTE near the quarter pole, drove clear past the three sixteenths, and held. REJOICE AN BE GLAD leapt slightly
out of the gate, chased at the middle of a stretched-out field, took closer order in the three path on the far turn, swung out into the five to six path into the
lane while under a drive, responded with a rally and was gaining to the wire. ORIENTAL LADY settled toward the rear of a well-strung field early, was
pushed along into the backstretch and took closer order, continued toward the rear while saving ground around the far turn, came into the lane under a drive
and offered a mild rally inside. LITTLE CHICK was bumped by SKY FREAK in the opening strides, soon trailed, took closer order in the five to six path on
the far turn, came into the lane in the six path, and passed outside tiring horses under a drive. OF NOTE disputed the pace two wide to the half mile mark,
cleared into the far turn, was headed by SKY FREAK to her outside near the quarter pole, and weakened past the three sixteenths. RETRO STREET
hopped out of the gate and came away a step slowly, settled second last in a strung-out field through the clubhouse turn, was pushed along three wide past
the three quarters and took closer order, chased under a drive midfield around the far turn while continuing to take closer order, came into the lane three
wide while still under a drive but emptied out in the lane. LADY WARRIOR disputed the pace inside of OF NOTE to the half mile mark, had no response
when asked to keep up, lost ground in the three path around the bend, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, proved empty, and was not persevered with
past the three sixteenths.

HIGH ON SUGAR raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, navigated the second turn from the three path and
gained ground rapidly in late stretch on the outside to just get up in time. RIVER EVANGELIST broke slowly, was immediately angled in to save ground
around the first turn, moved up on the outside in the backstretch, was bumped by GIACALLURE near the five eighths pole, raced in the two path around the
far turn, slipped through on the rail entering the stretch to take the lead, and was caught in the final strides. MCHENRY saved ground around the first turn,
raced at the back of the pack through the next half mile, navigated the far turn from the three path, swung to the outside entering the stretch, and gained
ground rapidly on the outside in late stretch. BIG MONEY MACHINE raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path near the three eighths pole, raced gamely in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final sixteenth of
a mile. YOU SPLIT TENS broke quickly, led the field from the rail around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn
and dueled gamely in upper stretch, giving way in the final sixteenth of a mile. LEMON BLITZ stalked the frontrunners through the opening half mile, saved
ground throughout and finished evenly. HONEST TO GOODNESS saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, improved position
from the two path around the turn, was in tight quarters entering the stretch and was outfinished. GIACALLURE raced at the back of the pack while saving
ground around the first turn, began to move up entering the backstretch, veered out sharply and bumped with RIVER EVANGELIST near the five eighths

Footnotes
RACHELGOTSTEPHEN settled at the rear, raced two wide in the rear flight into the turn, rallied between horses around the bend, sustained her rally
outside of LADY EXPRESS into the lane, continued to improve outside under a drive, ran on five wide in the final furlong, continued on unfazed when
bumped by AMERICAN BIZ inside the sixteenth pole, and got up in the final fifty yards. AMERICAN BIZ tracked the leading pair two wide, took closer order
three wide on the turn, sustained her rally three wide into the lane, led four wide with a sixteenth of a mile remaining, came out past the sixteenth pole and
bumped RACHELGOTSTEVEN but was nonetheless headed by her in the final fifty yards. LADY EXPRESS settled toward the rear inside of MY IDOL early,
chased in the two path on the turn, went to a drive through horses in the lane, altered inside approaching the sixteenth pole, sustained her rally but was
outkicked. KIANA'S LOVE was sent for speed, set the pace while pressured by BOOHOO SUE to her outside, cleared into the turn, led in the two path
around the bend, carried a diminishing lead under a drive in the lane, was headed with a sixteenth of a mile remaining and flattened out. EDISTO ISLAND
tracked the leading pair inside of AMERICAN BIZ, took closer order while pushed along inside horses around the turn, chased on into the lane while still in
range, but weakened inside through the final sixteenth. KENAI COOL settled second last, continued in the rear flight inside of RACHELGOTSTEPHEN into
the turn, raced under a drive while saving ground around the bend, but had no kick in the lane. BOOHOO SUE was sent for speed, pressed outside of
KIANA'S LOVE early, proved no match from the half mile mark, flattened between horses around the bend, came into the lane between horses while still no
match for the new leader, and emptied out. MY IDOL settled toward the rear outside of LADY EXPRESS early, was pushed along three wide into the turn,
continued near the rear four wide around the bend, and offered no bid in the lane. HAL'S MISCHIEF chased midfield early, settled back between horses
toward the rear into the turn, raced three wide past the three eighths, came into the lane under a drive between horses, but proved empty.

on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid between horses in upper stretch and gained ground late while drifting
out some in the final furlong. BOOM BOX was bumped by the horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to race between horses in the middle of the
pack, came around the turn in the two path, angled out at the top of the stretch to find room and gained ground quickly on the outside while drifting in slightly
in the final furlong. CLUB SODA dueled for the lead on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly in the stretch while giving way
