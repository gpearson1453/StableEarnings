Footnotes
HIDDEN STYLE settled nicely off the pace, made a three wide run on the far turn, easily ran by the leader, responded when roused and pulled away under
urging. DOHKO set the pace on the inside racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the far turn, was no match for the winner, then well clear for the
place spot. STORM ALFEET raced two wide off the pace, advanced midway on the turn, rallied on the rail and got up late for third. FEISTY KITTEN was off
a bit slow, raced four wide early, trailed the field, went three wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. SWIFT KID raced off the pace inside, moved up three
wide on the far turn and flattened out in the lane. MASTERIO stalked two wide, lacked a bid and faded. ANALYZEYOURVISION tracked inside, gave way,
was eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
LUCY'S TOWN raced three wide early, settled two wide off the pace, moved up inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail passing the quarter pole, dueled with
BIG BASE in the stretch drive and edged away late for the win. BIG BASE raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied four
wide past the quarter pole, dueled with the winner and came up second best. OCEANO ROSSO raced three wide early, cleared off to set the pace, showed
the way into the far turn, dueled between rivals passing the quarter pole, weakened and earned the show spot. PRINCESS MIKAYAH raced off the pace
inside and failed to threaten. DO WHAT IT TAKES stalked two wide, chased the leaders on the far turn and faded. BLAZING BROOKE tracked inside, bid
two wide on the far turn, dueled between rivals and checked in tight while tiring entering the stretch. BAMBOO GARDEN raced off the pace inside and did
not factor. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the run past the quarter pole, the race was declared official.
