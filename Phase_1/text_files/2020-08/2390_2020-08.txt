LANDING ZONE , up close early, circled the turn three wide, floated to the four path in upper stretch, gained command in mid stretch and drew clear. TIZ
MICHELLE'S WAY lacked speed, circled the turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch and had a slight rally outside foes. PROUD MANDATE saved
ground around the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and failed to rally in an even effort. HALFINTHEWRAPPER sped to the early lead, saved
ground around the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and weakened. RAGING BLAZE , outside chasing the pace, weakened. JUMPING MICHELLE ,
outrun, was eased late.

outside leaving the three eighths, sparred inside the winner into the lane and gave way grudgingly. BIG BOOTS lacked speed while off the rail, came four
wide for the drive, advanced to the inside of a foe near the sixteenth marker and churned on to gain the show. BLUE DANUBE rated stalking the early pace,
had aim off the rail past the five sixteenths, shifted five wide while under pressure into the lane then faded late. PLEASANT LEE vied to the inside of
STRIVE FOR A CURE, eased back off that one nearing the half mile marker, pursued two wide into the stretch but came up empty. FATHER'S LUCK , off
the pace, saved ground into the stretch, moved up a bit past mid stretch then flattened out. SEATTLE RIC , four wide pursuing the leaders, was under
pressure mid turn and gave way. CHASING THE CANDY gave early chase towards the rail, dropped back into the then then was taken wide approaching

STIVA rushed up outside FIRTH to take the lead leaving the backstretch, angled in, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and
dug in tenaciously while kept under encouragement. FIRTH made the early lead, lost the advantage leaving the backstretch, angled out entering the turn,
then gamely chased the winner through the stretch. I LOVE YOU , four deep around the turn, was well placed in upper stretch and flattened out, 2s=d turn.
SO INNOCENT hugged the inner rail around the turn and failed to rally. WILKO LOVESONG was outrun. OUR STAR raced in the two path between horses
on the turn and was outrun. BOOMERANG MISS chased the early pace, was in the three path between horses mid way on the turn then faltered.

Footnotes
BELFOUR broke sharply and disputed the early pace towards the inside, moved clear heading towards the turn, was kept alert with a couple right handed
taps leaving the three eighths, turned away challenges approaching the stretch, spurted away once set down and eagerly widened while kept alert. V. I. P.
CODE rated in range, took closer order two wide nearing the five sixteenths, failed to keep pace past the quarter pole but kept on with some interest to be
clear for the place. MIDNIGHT ACT stalked three to four wide, was under pressure mid turn but lacked a solid response. SOUND OFF lagged early then
was taken wide, advanced three wide outside a pair of rivals mid turn, had aim under pressure into the lane then faded. BOBBY G was rated back from
between runners leaving the chute, saved ground under a ride into the stretch but lacked a bid. ONCE MORE EH vied outside the winner for nearly a half
mile, pursued to mid turn then faltered.

Footnotes
AIR ON FIRE took over soon after the break, set the pace two wide while handling some inside pressure, moved clear into the turn, edged further away past
the five sixteenths, responded when shaken up near the three sixteenths, wandered outward and held sway while steadily hand ridden through the final
seventy yards. CROUCHELLI , brushed at the break, settled off the pace while saving some ground, swung out to be about eight wide in upper stretch,
straightened and closed willingly to gain and earned the place in the final yards. ROYAL CRUSADER was hustled up to contention in the opening furlong
and forced the issue from the rail, gave hard chase to the inside of runners mid way on the turn, came out for room nearing the lane and kept on with effort.
ABSOLVED , four wide, made a mild move between runners mid turn then faded. READY AND RICH , sluggish from the gate, lost ground six wide outside
rivals leaving the far turn, edged up slightly mid turn then gave way through the drive. STONE COURAGEOUS gave hard chase three wide into the turn,
shifted in and came up empty. AIR TOKEN , five wide between rivals leaving the far turn, dropped back after a half mile.

Footnotes
GO AMANDA prompted the pace outside of TENDERNESS, drew alongside mid turn, dueled and poked a head in front while about three wide past the
three sixteenths, continued in a battle to the wire and proved resolute while kept to solid pressure. TENDERNESS took over early, set the pace towards the
rail, dug in when threatened past the five sixteenths, lost command in upper stretch but fought valiantly to the end. ELOQUENT LADY dropped in leaving
the half mile marker and quickly gained on the leaders, tracked under pressure past the five sixteenths, shifted out for the drive but went evenly in the final
furlong. RAGTIME SUZY broke a step slow, edged up four wide in the opening quarter mile to gain a forward spot, continued wide and was put to pressure
mid turn, failed to make an impact into the lane and faded. RIGHT NOTION angled in nearing the half mile pole, chased and gave way. LINEA VERDE gave
early pursuit three wide and faltered.
