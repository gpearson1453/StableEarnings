CRAZY KATER stalked the pace inside around the first turn, bid inside of the pacesetter midway down the backstretch, was forced to check when DEPUTY
BEN came in entering the far turn, angled three wide nearing the quarter pole, bid outside, seized command nearing the eighth pole, drove clear near the
sixteenth marker and held sway. HERCULES HARBOR settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and rallied
widest. HEY GRIFF stalked the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, led in upper stretch but weakened in the final furlong. WHISTLE PLAYER saved
ground off the pace, angled out in midstretch and lacked the needed rally. MORE THAN TEDDY saved ground and never threatened. STUNNING BABY
chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. DEPUTY BEN set the pace along the rail, drifted well off the inside down the backstretch, angled back
in entering the turn, dueled inside to upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
PALIO pressed the pace two wide, drew clear in midstretch and widened under left-handed urging. MY GIRL BLUE saved ground off the pace around the
turn, angled out in the stretch, rallied outside and had the rider lose the whip near the sixteenth pole. CYCLO set a pressured inside the winner and
weakened in the lane. TRIAL BALANCE stalked the pace four wide, bid nearing the lane, continued on the left lead and flattened out. HOUSE
IMPEACHMENT broke slowly, chased the pace four wide and lacked a rally. DAISY'S DOC failed to menace while racing two wide. PAUPING broke slowly,
saved ground and made little impact. POINT OF GRACE broke slowly and was outrun inside.

Footnotes
PRINCESS GRACE stalked the pace three wide, bid two wide into the far turn, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole, drew off in upper stretch,
continued on the left lead, drifted in under left-handed urging and widened as much the best. GOOD ON PAPER settled off the pace along the inside,
advanced down the backstretch, bid between foes around the far turn, was no match for the winner but stayed on to be clearly second best in the lane.
PYTHONESS steadied at the start, raced off the pace two wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, went four wide around the far turn and was along
for the show. LEXOPHILIA saved ground in midpack early, advanced inside down the backstretch, remained in good position inside around the far turn,
tipped out in upper stretch and came up empty. OSAGE TREATY failed to menace while racing two and three wide. ZAWADI saved ground off the pace
early, went three wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. MO MARGARITA dueled two wide around the first turn, vied inside around the far turn and tired
in the lane. EASY'S FINAL ROSE was outrun inside. LADY MAGNOLIA had brief speed inside.

Footnotes
I DREAM OF LOIS set a rated pace along the rail, widened in upper stretch and held firm under a drive. DURVEN settled off the pace along the inside,
advanced two wide between foes around the far turn and finished willingly. GLORY RIDE raced off the pace while saving ground, made progress inside
around most of the far turn, swung four wide leaving the quarter pole and rallied outside. LUV HER BABY BLUES tracked the pace from the rail and lacked
a rally. HALLUCINATION saved ground in midpack, went two wide around the far turn and lacked a closing bid. SECRET TEMPLE never threatened while
racing three and four wide. EYES ON FIRE stalked the pace two wide and tired through the lane. ICY LADY chased the pace three wide and faded after six
furlongs. LEARN STORY (DOM) steadied at the start, saved ground and was outrun.

SHERKALI (IRE) tracked the pace inside, bid two wide approaching the final hurdle, dueled two wide around the far turn, put away the pacesetter leaving
the eighth pole, led to deep stretch but was caught in the final strides in a game try. LEMONADE THURSDAY settled off the pace along the inside, made
progress around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied between foes to gain the show. COMPASS ZONE sprinted clear soon after the start, set
the pace along the inside, dug in inside of SHERKALI from the final hurdle to midstretch and weakened a bit late. ARKADAG was in range inside and came
up empty in the lane. NO MANS LAND failed to menace while racing two wide. MR. HAIRE chased the pace two wide and tired around the far turn. LOVE

Footnotes
GO AS YOU PLEASE stalked from while on the rail, took the lead on the final turn, kicked clear being driven all out. PENITENCE settled covered up,
patiently advanced on the final turn, rallied in the stretch to secure second. FLAMMETTA rated well mid pack, switched to the outside top of the stretch,
closed strongly for third. HIGH SIERRA went unhurried early, finished evenly in the stretch. LEAR AVIA had a snug hold from the start, stalking, dueled on
the final turn, then gave way. JUST A WHIM saved ground and had no finishing rally. OVER TO YOU led for a mile and a half, was overtaken when pace
quickened and faded. CAUSEI'MWONDERFUL went unhurried early, inched closer on the backstretch, then tired. DEMELZA traveled wide and was pulled
up after one mile, walked off.
