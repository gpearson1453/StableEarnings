GOLD CROSS In hand off the rail, slipped inside when the rail when clear into the lane, quickly found the lead and drew off as much the best. EARLY
RETIREMENT Set the pace along the two path on the turns, was hooked into the lane when leaving the rail open and then was clearly not a match for the
winner. GUERRERON Rated four wide up the backstretch, asked four wide into the lane, gained some appearing to have a chance with a furlong remaining
and then hung. CONSTRUCT Tracked along the three path on the turns and tired. WIN BIGLY Lagged back, three path on the turns and failed gain.
FORECASTER Well placed along the three path, two path on the last turn and tired. GUSTY WIND Trailed and tired.
