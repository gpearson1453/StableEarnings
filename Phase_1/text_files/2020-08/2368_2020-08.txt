THIRST TRAP settled well off the lead, rallied in the three path at the three-eighths pole, then drew off in the stretch under mild urging. MESANGE was
unrushed with the winner, bid at the quarter pole but proved best of rest. PRECIOUS ARCH drew off early before yielding in the stretch. OXBOWINDY
stalked inside before giving way, then passed tired ones. BLUNT BRUNETTE and THE MORE I BURN stalked the pace before giving way. ATALANTA
BELLE was clear briefly, then saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
WYMAN set the pace while staying in the two path, shook loose to a clear margin in upper stretch, and held under driving pressure. PRETTY BOY DAVE
chased the pace two wide and between horses, then kept on to produce a bid for the lead in the late stages, but did not have enough to catch the leader.
TOPPING pressed the pace along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, and just held show. CORBIN trailed early on, came
into the lane six wide, and produced a mild rally for a minor reward. RUH ROH RAGGY was forwardly placed along the inside early on, but retreated to
midpack into the turn, then kept on through the lane without threatening the leaders. DON'T MATTER was bumped at the start, raced off of the pace in the
two path around the turn before shifting five wide turning for home, but lacked a kick. DABITONME saved ground around the turn in midpack, but to no avail.
CONRAD IN CHARGE tracked from midpack in the four path, produced a four wide bid for place turning for home, but weakened through the lane. MY MAN
BECKETT chased the pace three wide, but weakened between horses turning for home. HOPPED UP broke out, raced far off of the pace in the six path
around the turn, and failed to factor. KULMER failed to threaten. MICHAELS TARNATION never got involved.

Footnotes
HENDY WOODS was a bit crowded between horses at the start, raced far off of the pace two wide around the first turn, improved down the backstretch and
patiently waited behind the leaders around the far turn, swung to the five path turning for home and produced a rally outside of foes to just get up at the wire.
PRANKED tracked from midpack along the inside, split foes two wide turning for home to be just off of the leader, produced a bid at the furlong pole, but
was outfinished by an outer oncharging rival. EVIL LYN cleared the field into the first turn and quickly established a loose lead, held that margin around the
far turn and through upper stretch, but met challenges from rivals inside the furlong pole, dug in, but was nailed on the wire. DOMINGA saved ground off of
the pace around the first turn, advanced in the four to five path around the far turn, then sustained a mild rally in the six path through the lane. OUTBURST
(GB) advanced four wide around the far turn, bumped a foe turning for home while bidding for place, then flattened out between horses at the furlong pole.
ASK BAILEY took the far turn in the four path, then stayed on through the lane. PASS THE PLATE trailed early on, took the far turn in the five path, and
passed tired foes. DREAMALILDREAMOFU stalked the pace two wide, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. NASTY stalked in the four to three
path around the turns, took a bump from an outer foe turning for home, then weakened between horses. FASHIONABLE LADY was forwardly placed along
the inside, but weakened at the quarter pole. URBAN FAIRYTALE tracked from midpack in the three path around the turns, but weakened. SNEAK PEEK
raced off of the pace in the four to six path around the turns, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
FANCY LIQUOR set the pace along the inside, but was challenged and headed by JUGGERNAUT in upper stretch, fought on gamely through the lane, and
reclaimed the lead inside the final sixteenth. JUGGERNAUT stalked two wide, bid for the lead turning for home and forged a narrow advantage in upper
stretch, but failed to kick away from his inner game counterpart, and was out dueled by that foe to the wire. KINENOS was off multiple lengths slowly, trailed
along the inside around the first turn, produced a rail rally through the far turn to edge show from outer foes at the furlong pole, then shifted to the three path
and was gaining on the leaders in the final stages. PEACE ACHIEVED was bumped at the start, saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, then
improved mildly in the three path between horses around the far turn, produced a bid for show in upper stretch, but was outfinished by an inner foe for that
position. ANDESITE was pinched back at the start, raced far off of the pace along the inside through the first turn before rallying five to four wide around the
far turn, vied for show outside of a pair of foes in upper stretch, but flattened out in midstretch. SUMMER ASSAULT raced far off of the pace two wide, and
failed to factor while passing tired rivals. MO HAWK tracked from midpack two wide around the first turn, chased the leading group three wide around the far
turn, then weakened in upper stretch. BILLY BATTS stalked along the inside, but weakened passing the quarter pole. NEW EAGLE raced far off of the pace
in the four to three path around the first turn, and was done early. RELENTLESS DANCER was forwardly placed three wide, but weakened into the far turn,
and wilted thereafter.

Footnotes
ASTROMAN prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead turning for home, drew off passing the furlong pole, and was kept to task through the late stages.
NEIGHBORLY was bumped between horses at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path around the turn, then rallied through the lane with a good
finish to achieve place in the final sixteenth. SHOTGUN JOE tracked from midpack two to three wide, edged place from the inner tiring pace setter at the
furlong pole, but was outfinished by an inner foe for that position inside the final sixteenth. AZZARO STEEL chased along the inside, but failed to keep pace
with the leaders around the turn, then kept on through the lane to pass a tired foe for a minor reward. NOBODY LISTENS set the pace along the inside, but
was headed by the eventual winner at the quarter pole, yielded to that foe in upper stretch, then weakened on his left lead through the lane. PLAY UP broke
in, chased the pace three to four wide, but weakened while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch. GUARD was never involved. DR. PRADO broke well,
but was quickly outsprinted, came under a drive to keep touch with the field, but failed to do so after a quarter mile, then was eased thereafter in a dull effort.
