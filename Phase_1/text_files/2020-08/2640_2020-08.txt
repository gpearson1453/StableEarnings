at the start and never a factor thereafter. LION LION never close. E Z MAN BAND brief foot, backed up steadily while no factor.

Footnotes
CARLY'S FLIGHT was inside while contending to the stretch and grinded away from foes to gain the win. SHEZA POP STAR had an awkward start, chased
the pace, steadied a bit from behind horses at the top of the turn, dove to the rail in upper stretch and gamely gained ground but could not catch the game
winnner. JUST ZOEY had speed in hand to the stretch, fought briefly for the lead and flattened out at the eighth pole. I'M DA BOSS bumped a horse at the
start, contended to the stretch while up close, angled out and drifted further out late. ALEXIS ROAD WEST was bumped hard between horses, managed to
stalk from the outside just off the leader and faded in late stretch. MYSTIC MAGIC bumped a horse at the start, lost a bit of gournd, stayed at the rear early,
took the six path on the turn and faltered in the stretch.

K FOR KATHY pressed outside the leader, drew away on the turn and had enough to stay clear to the wire. CRYPTONIC CATWALK tracked well off the
leaders, rallied in the three path on the far turn and got by a foe at the sixteenth pole to gain second. LUVYASEEYABYE was bumped at the start, went
inside on the first turn, was unhurried on the backstretch, had some rally on the far turn in the two path, came into the stretch in the six path and ran evenly.
NUTNBUTAROXSTAR was the speed at the rail, could not to stay with the winner on the turn and faded late. TREASURE WILBURNYA took the rear early
and saved ground on the turn to no avail. WHISPER VICTOR was unhurried, pulled up at the eighth pole and was vanned off.

AGAINST THE LINE tracked leader confidently to the quarter pole, roused and ran past outside to clear off. MR ZYDECO good position to far turn, lost
ground and shifted out into the stretch and gained in the late going. CHEAP SHOT raced evenly from off rail throughout with no late gain but gamely held
the show.spot. BRODYTHEOXMAN unhurried early to far turn, made a late run between horses. CHILI NELSON sprinted to the lead, set pace to stretch but
shortened stride while empty in the final furlong. TRAMORE BAY saved ground throughout, came off rail through the stretch with no gain. IRON MIKE never
a factor. GOBARRYBARRY was bothered at the start, made a mild middle move with nothing left from the far turn. SNORING BARTH was bothered at the
start and never a factor.

VERISSIMO tracked the leader from inside early, prompted that one up the backstretch, quickened to vie for the lead with that foe down the stretch and
stayed just clear of two game closers for the win but was vanned off. LET'SCALLITEVEN tracked from third, briefly vied with the leaders on the backstretch,
backed off, chased in earnest on the far turn and gamely battled in the lane to earn the place spot. GONE TOO SOON was an unhurried last, swung very
wide into the stretch and closed gamely and late for third. FUNNEL CAKE led reserved inside, quickened on the turn, vied down the stretch and gave way
past the sixteenth. TWO EAGLES took the four path in the first turn, stayed off the pace and was unable to keep up in the stretch.The fractions were
unavailable due to a timer malfunction but the final time is correct and electronically timed.

Footnotes
GOLDEN STAR LADY was the lone speed, drew off in the stretch and held clear late. SKY FACTOR sat in a good spot, was asked in upper stretch and
made a quick closing move late for the place spot. CHANGE OF CUSTODY chased a clear leader and kept on well down the stretch, only giving up place
late to a game closer. OHIO TIME raced well off the pace, took the turn inside and ran well to gain position down the lane. TAPS ran mid pack, veered out in
the stretch and gained late. CRUZIN COMO was under presure on the turn off the leader and faltered in the stretch. TREAT was toward the rear on the turn
and had some late run down the rail. KISS ME PRADO had an awkward start and was no threat. MISS OREILEY was off the pace and floated out a bit by a
foe on the turn. HOOSIER ARTIST was inside and close early, then backed up before the turn.
