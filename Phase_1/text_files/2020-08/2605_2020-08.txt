SCATSUKU tracked the pace, gained a striking position two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, edged ahead and held.
THE DRAKE set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held the place. HERO'S RETURN stalked the
pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. SIDE TRACKED mid pack, gained position
three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened in the drive. STUNNING BABY mid pack, looped up three and four wide
through the second turn, bid four wide into the stretch and had no rally. MIKEBRAVOZEROTHREE showed little. MONTANA GUY fractious in the gate, was
no factor. MR. MIKE was never involved.

CARAVEL vied for the early lead on the outside, bid outside the leader into the lane, shook clear, then drew off under mild uring. OWLETTE well placed and
outside, gained position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, then could not threaten the winner, while clearly best of the rest.
BUCKY'S DRAMA set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch,then weakened the final furlong and held the show. L. A. STAR
allowed to settle, looped three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and could not gain. FAST SCENE tracked the pace, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and had no rally. TWILA MAE was no factor.

Footnotes
BEN OF THE BUSH tracked the pace well back, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the lane,
shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. ART OF THE DREAM allowed to settle, looped three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into
the lane, then lacked the needed late kick and held the place. BIG RIG mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into
the lane and evened out. MIDNIGHTONBROADWAY sprinted to a long lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then
weakened the final furlong and held a share. NEAT STREET allowed to settle, looped four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and
weakened in the drive. CAN'TTAKEITWITHYOU mid pack, looped to position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path and weakened in the
drive. PRIVATE LAKE was no factor. SWINGSTAGE well placed and inside, steadily lost ground.
