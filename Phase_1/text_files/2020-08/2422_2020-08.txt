SHERILINDA bumped from the outside leaving the gate, showed speed to be up close inside, dropped back a bit and stalked the pace, saved ground
around the turn, rallied up the inside and bested PASITO in deep stretch. PASITO trailed early, entered the turn five wide then went four deep around the
bend, came five wide into the stretch, closed from the outside but was not enough. THUNDER WOMAN vied for the lead five deep then three deep at the
seven-sixteenths, moved clear past the three-eighths marker, showed the way a bit off the rail into the stretch, lost command inside the sixteenth pole and
held on for third. CANADIAN GINGER broke in and bumped rival, vied three deep then along the inside, chased three wide into the stretch, came with a
mild bid outside the leader but evened out in the final furlong. MUSICALLY off alertly from the outside, showed speed six deep then chased the top trio,
raced outside a rival on the turn, left the bend three to four wide and was outkicked in the late stages. SWEET HONOR bobbled and bumped both sides
leaving the gate, had early speed between foes then chased off the inside, went three to four wide around the turn and weakened. LA CROIX vied four deep

Footnotes
ADARE settled off the rail, went four wide through the turn, rallied through the lane, collared CANADIAN PRIDE at the sixteenth pole and drove clear.
CANADIAN PRIDE set the pace being pressured by MIDNIGHT MYSTERY into and around the turn, kicked clear entering the the stretch, headed by the
winner at the sixteenth pole and held the place. SEICHE unhurried in the beginning, angled in on the turn, closed up the inside but lacked room past the
eighth pole, found a clear path and kept on willingly. DISCO BALL lost footing, shifted in and bumped DIRECT LINE at the start, stalked outside the top pair,
took aim three wide leaving the turn but flattened in the final furlong. MIDNIGHT MYSTERY prompted the pace outside the leader into and around the turn,
could not keep pace into the lane and gave way. DIRECT LINE bumped leaving the gate, chased inside then dropped back on the turn, moved off the rail
and tired.

Footnotes
TILTED TOWERS drifted in and bumped ACTING CAT repeatedly in the early going, pressed that rival from the outside, collared foe into the stretch, moved
clear and held sway. MUCH MORE HALO angled in and stalked inside to the lane, angled out upper stretch, split foes and finished well to prove second
best. PORT SAINT JOE settled along the rail, tipped out in the stretch, roused nearing the sixteenth pole and produced a late bid to earn the show honors.
GRAZIANO chased two wide around the turn, angled out at the sixteenth pole and summoned a mild rally. MOST SANDISFACTORY traveled three wide
around the turn, four wide into the stretch, floated out by GRAZIANO with a sixteenth to go and passed tired rivals. CEM SULTAN off slow to begin then
advanced quickly off the rail, chased the top pair around the turn, bid three wide into the lane and weakened in the final furlong. ACTING CAT bumped
repeatedly in the early going, took command and set a pressured pace, fought back inside to the eighth pole then gave way. BIG DADDY RABBIT hopped
slightly to come away slowly, trailed from the inside to the stretch and never threatened. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
RONAMO brushed lightly from the outside leaving the gate, unhurried in the beginning from the inside then moved a bit off the rail, angled three wide
around the far turn, took over upper stretch, kicked clear with a furlong to go and drew off under urging. MONGOLIAN LEGEND stalked outside a rival then
between on the first turn, tracked outside the leader, asked near the five-sixteenths and collared rival at the quarter pole, took command shortly after,
showed the way into the stretch, offered no resistance to RONAMO in the drive and safely held second. NEGOTIATOR stalked near the inside, moved out
into the two path around the far turn and kept on for a clear third. ALVAARO went four wide into the first turn, came in a bit then back out leaving that bend,
chased four wide up the backstretch, moved into the three path around the far turn and weakened. MY JOURNEY broke in and brushed at the start, quickly
took command and steered to the inside, led clear to the far turn, pressured around the turn and relinquished the lead just past the quarter pole and
weakened in the drive. TAKEO bobbled leaving the gate, traveled five wide into the first turn, stayed well off the rail on the backstretch, entered the second
turn five then moved in to the four path and came up empty when called upon. CONVEX away quickly and angled in nearing the first turn, stalked outside
the leader, dropped back on the far turn, eased through the stretch and walked off.

CAISSON pressed the leader from outside, lost contact with HELIOCHROME at the half-mile point, chased two wide into the far turn, bid alongside around
that the turn, challenged through the drive and got up just in time. HELIOCHROME held command with CAISSON to the outside, inched away after a half,
responded when challenged again by CAISSON around the far turn, held the advantage through the final furlong and was edged at the wire. EAGLE IN THE
SKY raced along the inside in range of the pacesetter, steered out into the stretch and finished well for a clear third. PAPALE saved ground into the lane
and bested the rest. EL JOY entered the first turn three wide, raced outside a rival then two wide into the stretch and weakened. ZOFFA pulled in the early
stages, tracked outside a rival on the backstretch, went three wide around the far turn and also weakened. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
C'MON JENNA bumped both sides then checked soon after the start, settled off the rail then moved in, closed in and took aim two wide into the stretch,
ranged up alongside FATHER O'FLAHERTY and proved best late. FATHER O'FLAHERTY off slow to begin then sent from the inside, went up to challenge
the leader, took over near the three-eights, cleared rival around the bend, resisted when challenged from the outside and went gamely to the wire. LEMON
DROP SHOT raced wide throughout and finished well to gain ground on the top pair. BLUE STAR went five wide into the turn, angled into the two path then
was carried out and bumped by rival at the three-sixteenths, straightened out and finished willingly. PAISANO broke out and bumped rival at the start,
chased off the rail, angled out four wide around the turn and weakened in the lane. COZY BEAR broke in and bumped in the beginning, angled in on the
turn then came back out and bumped rival approaching the three-sixteenths and had nothing left for the late stages. ROUSING SLAMMER bumped both
sides at the start, angled in on the turn and lacked a rally. CALL SIGN LUCKY away quickly and sped clear, set the pace early, challenged from the inside,
lost the advantage near the three-eighths, entered the stretch three to four wide and tired. THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED PAISANO FROM FIFTH TO
SEVENTH FOR BREAKING OUT AND CAUSING INTERFERENCE TO ROUSING SLAMMER AT THE START.

Footnotes
UNDENIABLE PROOF set the pace with company to the outside, dueled with HIT THE SEAM around the turn and into the stretch, battled through the final
furlong and held foe at bay. HIT THE SEAM pressed outside, moved closer and dueled into and down the stretch, fought through the late stages but could
not get by. ZIPPER MISCHIEF tracked outside a rival, two wide into the lane, chased the top pair to the wire and held the show. DOC TOMMY stalked the
pace from the inside then a bit off the rail in the stretch and finished well between foes late. FOSTER BOI off a bit slow to begin, saved ground along the
inside, rallied and missed the show. FOOTHILL traveled mid-pack in the early going, moved to the inside then out into the two path, angled out in the lane,
bumped rival in the stretch and lacked a serious bid. DREAMER'S REALITY off a bit slow to begin, dropped back early, raced inside, angled out on the turn,
came out then back inward in the stretch and never threatened. JOHNNY PODRES mid-pack early and outside a rival, raced three wide then angled out in
the stretch, bumped with FOOTHILL and weakened. SCOUTED off slow to begin, raced outside a rival, two or three wide then angled in on the turn and was
never a factor. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
FOREST CARAWAY tracked off the inside, spun four wide into the stretch, closed outside MANDRAGORA SEEKER and drew clear. ILLUMINATION well
placed just off the leader while outside a rival, chased three wide into the lane, lacked needed late punch but held the place. KALYPSO chased inside and
saved ground into the stretch, came off the rail a bit and lacked room behind rival past the eighth pole, angled back to the fence and finished willingly. ISN'T
SHE LOVELY tracked off the rail, split foes on the turn then angled out and finished with a mild late bid. MANDRAGORA SEEKER stumbled leaving but still
away quickest, sped clear and showed the way up the backstretch, moved to the inside and traveled clear in the two path into the stretch, lost command
inside the furlong marker and weakened in deep stretch. PARK AVENUE traveled in the two path then moved out and exited the turn three wide and lacked
rally. I'M ALL THE JEDI lacked early speed, took the turn three wide and was never a factor. DERBY QUEST off slow to begin and always outrun. SHVERE
ARBETER took the turn four then five wide and proved no menace.

Footnotes
PULPIT RIDER off a bit slow at the start, settled a bit off the rail, angled out around the far turn, rallied five wide in the lane and caught SEDAMAR at the
wire. SEDAMAR well placed along the inside, saved ground and cut the corner into the stretch, rallied next to the fence, led late but got caught by the
winner. MUCHO UNUSUAL brushed with CORDIALITY leaving the gate, settled outside a rival, closed in nearing the far turn, bid three deep around the
bend, took command in upper stretch but could not match the top pair late. CORDIALITY bobbled and brushed with MUCHO UNUSUAL in the beginning,
stalked near the inside, moved out and bid between rivals near the quarter pole, challenged in the drive but faltered late. KITTY BOOM BOOM off alertly
from the outside, went for the lead and crossed over near the inside, opened up on the backstretch while off the rail, moved back down to the inside and
raced along the rail into the far turn, showed the way in the two path into the stretch then lost command and weakened in the final furlong. HAND TIMED.

PYRON settled off the rail in the early going, took the turn three wide, bid outside MERALD MAGIC in the drive, took over mid stretch and prevailed.
EMERALD MAGIC shoe repair prior to the start, dueled for the lead outside a rival, moved clear then shifted out at the top of the lane, met another
challenger from the outside, resisted through the lane and finished gamely inside the winner. TOBACCO ROAD settled at the at the rear of the field while off
the rail, steered out leaving the bend and further out at the top of the stretch, showed a mild rally gained the show. LIL SYDNEY tracked outside a rival, went
three wide into the turn, angled five wide around the bend and lost the show. ZIMBA WARRIOR tracked along the inside, saved ground around the turn and
improved position. CAUSE AND EFFECT chased inside then moved out into the two path and lacked a serious bid. PRESS BRIEFING hustled to the front,
dueled into and around the turn, then weakened in the lane. IT'S TIZ TIME traveled two then three wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and never
responded to urging. LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH attended the pace three deep, chased the top pair four wide into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
MITHQAAL sped to the front outside a pair of rivals, cleared into the first turn, set the pace inside, asked in the lane and found more to hold off MR. ROARY
to the wire. MR. ROARY contested the pace from the inside then stalked the leader into the first turn, raced a bit off the rail then two wide into the stretch,
chased the MITHQAAL through the drive then dug in late from the outside but could not get by the winner. MOVE OVER (GB) rank between runners leaving
the chute, settled off the rail, went three wide around the turn, came out in the lane and gained ground deep stretch. PUBILIUS SYRUS bumped with inside
rival leaving the chute, settled near the inside, angled out on the second turn, angled back inside in upper stretch and showed a mild late bid. OCEAN FURY
bumped with rival leaving the chute, stalked from the inside, checked past the three-eighths pole, saved ground to the stretch, angled out in the lane and
weakened. NEVER EASY tracked three deep then four wide into the lane, bothered by inside rival in the stretch and never rallied. CONTAGION chased
between foes to the far turn and never responded to urging. ACKER moved to the inside early trailing the field, saved ground into the stretch then angled out
and proved no menace. THE HUNTED vied between rivals early then stalked outside a rival into the clubhouse turn, came three wide into the stretch and
faded. HAND TIMED.
