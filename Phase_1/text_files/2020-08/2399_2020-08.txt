SHOW SLIDING HOME raced close up in the three path, chased and caught the leader past mid turn and was clear at the three sixteenths. KING CORN
was bumped by a foe at the start, moved outside early, gained on the leader around the turn, loomed large at rhe top of the stretch but could not keep pace
with the winner and nearly lost the place to a fast closer. OFTEN ENOUGH bumped a horse at the start, waited, came widest into the stretch, closed best
and just missed grabbing second. OL' L B had an awkward start, prompted the leader from inside, lacked a rallly on the turn, shifted out for the stretch run
and passed a fader late. REBEL'S REVENGE broke sharply, led to the quarter pole under some pressure, then faded while inside down the lane.

Footnotes
IT'S GAME TIME raced near the back, moved outside for room in late backstretch, took the four path on the far turn and started to advance at the quarter
pole, then rolled past the leaders at tthe eighth pole for the win. SWING WEST attended the pace, pressed the early leader at the top of the turn, fought for
position down the lane but was no match for the winner while holding second. CHILI NELSON was early inside speed, got pressured at the top of the turn
and was battling a foe down the lane as both were passed by a clearing off winner, and then settled for show. SKATINGONTHINICE prompted the lead
outside, backed off on the turn, but had enough to hold fourth down the lane. RUSSIAN TO TAPIT was bumped at the start and improved position while no
menace. BOURBON SHOTTE was unhurried, came widest into the stretch and improved position. PRIME TIME was mid pack and backed up on the far
turn. DARBY DART was mid pack and backed up on the far turn.

WILD ABOUT YOU was unhurried to the far turn, ranged up in the four path, fought a foe for the lead from the top of the turn to the eighth pole and drew
clear the final furlong. TAKE CHARGE D'ORO was a reserved leader to the backstretch, angled out and dropped off the lead in late backstretch, re-rallied to
return to the lead on the far turn, fought the winner to the eighth pole and yielded. PEPPERED took the five path on the first turn, led nearing the far turn,
angled inside, factored to mid stretch and faded. TESTY KITTEN was under some restraint while at the rail early, got closer from inside on the backstretch,
came under a ride on the turn, moved out in the stretch and lacked the needed rally.The fractional times are unavailable due to a timer malfunction, the final
time is hand timed.

Footnotes
CIRCLE AWAY raced in the second flight to the far turn, advanced to circle the field, led in the stretch and held off a foe late. HONDO GUSTO was last
early, came wide on the backstretch, was on the move nearing the turn and charged down the stretch to get the place. TUF INTENSITY took the four path in
the first turn, tracked the leader up the backstretch in the three path, quickened on the turn, led briefly entering the stretch but leveled out in the final furlong.
SOUTHERN CROSS was in the 2nd flight, could not stay with the leaders on the far turn, had some rally and passed a tired foe late to improve position.
GIOVANTE tracked between horses, ran evenly and leveled out in late stretch. UNITED STAND was bumped at the start, took a reserved lead to the turn
and faded. SHATTERPROOF was bumped at the start, involved to the quarter and began to fade.

foes down the stretch and led past the sixteenth pole. ANNMARIA came from behind, moved up on the rail in the turn, had good energy at the inside down
the stretch and was second best. BE A LOVELY DAY was pinched at the start, sped to the lead, battled foes on the turn, vied with the winner in the stretch,
and managed to hold show late. G CODE bumped a foe at the start, chased just behind the pacesetter to the turn, ended up between leaders, ran evenly
down the lane and settled for fourth. MUSIC CITY WOLF was up close, needed more on the turn, found some pace in the stretch and improved postion in

horses at the start, took the turn in the five path, moved up in the stretch and flattened out late. COOKIES CAT bumped between horses at the start, vied for
the lead in the five path on the turn, led briefly, but tired in late stretch.
