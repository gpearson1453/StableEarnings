Footnotes
UNCLE ANDREW was unhurried and well within striking range early, moved off the inside and closed in on the leaders four wide near the quarter-pole, took
over outside VENERATE and BODIE CODY in upper stretch and drew away under a mild drive. TIZ LUNA raced in the second flight two wide for six
furlongs, got switched out in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals to pick up the place. MR TITO'S saved ground outrun to the stretch, moved to the
three-path outside the eighth-pole and offered a mild response. GRAN HOMBRE was five wide into the first turn before moving inward, swung back out four
wide approaching the stretch, and could not menace with an even finish. VENERATE set the pace inside, came under attack after a half-mile, and
weakened through upper stretch. BODIE CODY prompted the early pace, challenged between horses into the far turn, and gave way through the late
stages. HUBBA BUBBA was no factor mostly three wide on the turns. CHAOS KID pressed the pace three wide, and faded after six furlongs. STORM RISK
was outrun throughout. ALL D' HYPE was never prominent.

Footnotes
PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL sped to the front at the start, rated along inside getting a bit of a breather around the turn, responded through the stretch and stayed
clear. SHE TAKES HEART lunged awkwardly at the break, advanced four wide after six furlongs, and could not reach the winner while clearly second best.
LEDECKY came under a ride four wide on the turn, and lacked a solid response. TAKE THE OVER pursued PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL from outside, and faded
after six furlongs. PICASSO MOON tired inside after a half-mile. BELIEVE INDEED tracked outside the leaders up the backstretch, and was empty on the
turn.

Footnotes
WISE TO LISTEN got pushed out into CITY PARK by EXTRA EXTRA at the start, lagged well back to the far turn, advanced approaching the stretch being
guided out to the four-path, overhauled the leaders from outside in deep stretch and drove clear. HARD COUNT prompted the pace outside EXTRA EXTRA,
took over at the top of the stretch, and fought gamely to the finish inside rivals. SUN SQUALL stayed in range early, moved off the inside coming under a
ride midway on the far turn, challenged outside HARD COUNT in upper stretch, and was outkicked between foes past the furlong marker. CITY PARK
hopped at the break and was pushed out by WISE TO LISTEN, raced three to four wide for six furlongs, and finished one-paced outside. RIGGINS saved
ground outrun early, remained well back three wide approaching the stretch, and gained mildly while no late threat. RED SORRELL was never a factor.
EXTRA EXTRA broke out pushing WISE TO LISTEN into CITY PARK, set the pace inside for six furlongs, and folded up into the lane. LUCKY MIKE
dropped far back soon after completing a half-mile, and was eased up through the stretch.

TURN ON THE MAGIC vied inside MAGNOLIA BLVD, put that one away and was joined from outside by ESPRESSO CALIENTE after six furlongs, edged
away from the latter after straightening away for the drive, and held firm to the finish. DARDANELLOS was in the second flight but within range between
horses early, loomed four wide at the top of the lane, shied out and in from the whip and could not reach the top one. FRANK FIRST saved ground to the
stretch, finished evenly and was up inside ESPRESSO CALIENTE for the show. ESPRESSO CALIENTE tracked outside in easy striking distance, bid three
wide with a quarter-mile remaining, but flattened out through upper stretch. NO GETTING OVER ME bumped with MAGNOLIA BLVD at the start, got taken
out widest after that, and faded five wide off the turn. MAGNOLIA BLVD vied for command outside TURN ON THE MAGIC for a bit more than five furlongs,
and gave way.

Footnotes
ZODIAC PRINCESS pressed ITS ABOUT ME from outside for a half-mile, took over into the far turn, shook off a bid from BLAME THE GODS through
upper stretch, and dug in late for the decision. CALENTITA (IRE) advanced after six furlongs while covered up behind horses, altered course outside the
winner in deep stretch and did not have enough. QUEEN FIELD stayed toward the inside throughout, and was up for the show along the fence. BLAME
THE GODS was never far back, loomed a threat three wide a quarter-mile from home, but flattened out through the furlong grounds. MONEY FACTOR
raced two to three wide for six furlongs, and gained mildly outside without threatening. GENERIC MARK ducked out at the start and was off behind the field,
raced three then four wide for six furlongs, and lacked the needed rally. RUN BLONDIE RUN saved ground outrun to the stretch, and could not gain. MISS
MY MACHO advanced three wide on the far turn, and faded in the drive. ITS ABOUT ME set the early pace hounded by the eventual winner, and retreated
around the far turn inside.

three-eighths, caught BIBIANA from outside near the furlong marker and drove clear. LADY ARCHA was outsprinted two then three wide for a half-mile,
rallied willingly and was up for the place while no threat to the winner. BIBIANA bumped with QUEEN ABARRIO after the start, took over outside SOLID AS
A ROCK early on the turn, shifted in drawing clear five-sixteenths out, could not handle KOZY DREAMS through upper stretch, and lost second late. SOLID
AS A ROCK set the early pace under pressure from both flanks, yielded to BIBIANA before completing three-eighths of a mile, and dropped back. QUEEN
ABARRIO got bumped and jostled around between KOZY DREAMS and BIBIANA soon after the start, stopped four wide late on the turn, was pulled up in
the stretch, and walked off.

Footnotes
VITAEMI tucked in nicely behind the leaders for six furlongs, tipped out for the drive, overpowered MEADOW BEAUTY from outside and drew off.
STARSHIP MALLOMAR went along between horses in the two-path early, brushed with CHAMPAGNE BLISS in the process of shifting out for room in
upper stretch, and finished well. MEADOW BEAUTY crossed over and cleared to the early lead, rated along inside through an even pace for six furlongs,
shook off PIECE BY PEACE turning for home, had no answer for the winner past the eighth-pole and weakened. GLORIOUS GAL saved ground on the
turns, moved to the two-path in the stretch and lacked a solid bid. BIG TINA broke slowly, and failed to menace through a four-wide trip. PIECE BY PEACE
pressed the pace outside MEADOW BEAUTY, could not get past that foe on the far turn under a ride, and gave way into the lane. CHAMPAGNE BLISS
stayed in range three wide to the top of the stretch, and brushed with STARSHIP MALLOMAR while weakening in upper stretch. DANGEROUS CURVES
steadied along keyed up through the stretch the first time, got wrangled back through the first turn, fanned widest approaching the stretch and was empty.

Footnotes
SNAP HOOK closed in outside BRASSTOWN approaching the stretch, stayed on task through a long drive, and wore down the leader in the last 50 yards.
BRASSTOWN sped off early, saw a good portion of the lead whittled away after six furlongs, dug in along the rail through a long drive, yielded stubbornly
and salvaged the place. CREA'S BKLYN LAW lagged well back early, reached contention with a four-wide run on the turn, loomed outside through the
stretch but did not have enough. CANDY CRUSHEM raced three wide taking closer order after six furlongs, and was one-paced through the lane. ICONIC
raced three to four wide through the turn, had the rider lose the whip in upper stretch, and could not gain. IL FARAONE dropped far back early inside, and
never fired. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
MYSTICAL MOON led early inside, deferred to AWESOME PARTY on the first turn, tracked outside that rival up the backstretch, rebid and poked a head in
front a quarter-mile out, and drove clear through the stretch. MASON'S SONG moved up four wide ridden along on the far turn, rallied willingly outside and
was clear for second while no real threat to the winner. IM THE CAPTAIN NOW had a ground-saving journey, and finished up evenly for the show. ROCK
THE CAUSEWAY settled in the middle of the field for six furlongs, and lacked a solid late response in the three-path. CRYPTO GOLD was outrun for six
furlongs, came four wide off the far turn and improved on the far outside without threatening. DEVOTED KITTEN was never prominent. UNLIMITED DATA
was forwardly placed to the stretch near the two-path, and tired through the late stages. GRAYDAR'S RESOLVE saved ground to the far turn, moved out
four wide nearing the stretch, and made no headway. DUKE OF MONROE stayed in range for six furlongs, and dropped back approaching the stretch two
wide. BLUESKY KITTEN was always outrun. AWESOME PARTY was three wide into the first turn, cleared outside MYSTICAL MOON for the lead and
moved inside after a quarter-mile, got overhauled after six furlongs, and dropped back inside. MACHIAVELLI saved ground in the second flight early, moved
out three wide advancing after a half-mile, but was finished by upper stretch.
