SLEW'S DA BOSS stalked the contested early pace while saving ground along the inside, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, tipped four wide
entering the lane, and closed determinedly to be up in time. FRANKIE MACHINE away well and pressed the pace two out from the rail entering the
backstretch, continued to force the issue three wide through the final turn, and finished willingly two out from the rail in the drive to hold the place. HIGHWAY
BOSS unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, and closed
with a rush to get up for a share. BOUNDARY BAY broke sharply and dueled for the lead from between rivals in the run down the backstretch and through
the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive. METAL MAGIC away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a
pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, but faded in the late stages. FORT LANGLEY stalked the
dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished
three out from the rail in the drive, but needed more late.

smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished with late interest two wide in the drive to get up for a share. SWEET SIXTEEN away well and
stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while

FOOT SOLDIER broke sharply and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the turn, maintained his advantage into the lane, and held off the late
surge of RICHARD'S COMMAND to prevail. RICHARDS COMMAND ducked in soon after the start and rushed up to chase the leader one out from the rail
entering the turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive to just miss. SOUTHERN LASS away alertly and chased the leader into the turn while
saving ground at the rail, and closed from along the inside in the drive to hold on for a share. BLUEPRINT away well, but lacked the early speed to force the
issue running into the turn while one out from the rail, but finished with late interest two wide in the drive. JERSEY CITY chased the leaders into the turn
while racing one out from the rail, and finished from along the inside in the drive while unable to make a late impact. TUXEDO was off a step slow, and
trailed the field in the run to the turn, and failed to be a factor. CASH IN COMMAND was devoid of the early speed need to contend in the run to the turn,
and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
G M T BABY away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace into the final turn, and closed determinedly
one out from the rail in the drive to hold off a late charge by AMORCITO to prevail. AMORCITO stalked the leaders from along the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive to just miss. CURIOUS
RUMOR broke sharply and pressed the pace one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide through the final
turn, and into the stretch, and closed three wide in the drive in a solid effort. MOUSEY MOUSEY tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two
out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive in an even effort. STEVIE'S SONG tracked the leaders into the
backstretch while racing just out from the rail, raced under snug restraint while one out from the rail in the run to the final turn, and finished four wide in the
drive while being outfinished late. BABYLON WILL FALL unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but failed to
make a serious late impact while finshing three out from the rail in the drive. RAISE A DANCER away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while
racing between rivals, but began to weaken entering the final turn, and had little to offer late.

backstretch, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed with a rush two wide from between rivals in deep stretch to just miss the
place. BABY GRAND away alertly and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and
through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late. STAY ALL NIGHT settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive. ATOMIC HAZE broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch,

HEART OF TEXAS broke sharply and tracked the leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch, tipped three wide to collar the leader entering the
final turn, quickly assumed control and drew clear late as much the best. THE KAT'S BACK stalked the leaders while racing two out from the rail entering
the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. BLUEBERRY HONEY stalked the
leaders from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the stretch drive.
STONERIDGE AMBER away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run to
the final turn, was overtaken soon after entering the turn, and outfinished late. DAY PASS away well and tracked the leaders while racing two out from the
rail entering the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished six wide in the drive while not being persevered with. REIGNS DREAMZ
settled off the early pace while racing two wide entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon.
NANOOK settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and improved her position over the final
furlong without ever threatening. IBROX GIRL unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back, and failed to menace while finishing at the
rail late. ALAFAIR pressed the pace one out from the rail entering the backstretch, forced the issue to the final turn before weakening. GOTTCHA BRAN
DEE settled behind the early speed while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, and faded over the final furlong.
