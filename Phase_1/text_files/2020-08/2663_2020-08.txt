SURGE PRICING was away alertly from the gate and set the early pace, was off the rail into the lane while under pressure but repelled that bid, drifted
about down the lane and cleared the field in the final stages. CHRISTIANS CITY tracked the pace early on, rolled up and made a bid nearing the lane, was
in the three path into the lane but was kept at bay in the stretch run. CHANNELEDSLONGSHOT chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane,
made a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. ICY STREET stalked the pace early, was in the five path into the lane while making a bid but
weakened late in the stretch drive. TWINKLING KNIGHT raced widest into the lane and improved position. BAQUERO FLIES was never a threat. MARKET
