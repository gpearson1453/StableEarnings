Footnotes
DERECHO WARRIOR stalked the early pace from the inside, angled outside entering the turn, responded when asked and inched clear late. ZENS
SECRET chased the early pace from the inside, advanced through the turn, responded when sat down for the drive and rallied late for the place. GO GET
THAT forced the early pace from the outside, dueled through the turn, remained engaged for the drive but could not keep pace. BLUEWATER CAT pressed
the early pace from the outside, made a bid entering the turn but faltered in the drive. SUPER HANDY MAN could only improve position. ALL BIZNESS
chased the early pace and faded. GRAN RED could only pass tired ones. HORACE CHARLES broke sharp from the outside, gained a clear early margin
then faded in the drive. IKON WHO had a steady fade. HOLY SUNRISE forced the early pace and gave way. FAST CHANCE was never close.

Footnotes
GATO AMERICANO dueled from the inside for the early margin, battled up the backstretch, fought through the second turn, remained engaged for the drive,
responded and inched clear late. JOEMO chased the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded along the rail and was
just up for the place. VICTOR LOUNGE (IRE) dueled from the outside early, battled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the drive but could not
keep pace. SECOND GUESS unhurried early from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, responded entering the drive but was too late.
BINDING went evenly. WHOLE LOTTA LUCK could only pass tired ones. STANTON C was no factor. BAD BOY JOHNNY was no threat. BULLET BANDIT
chased the early pace and faded. One mils split time unavailable due to a timer malfunction.
