Footnotes
TAYLOR'S TOURIST broke with the field, asked along early, advanced to vie three wide through the turn, kicked strongly clear in the drive in a solid effort.
GO FIGURE broke alertly, with the early pace inside, continued to vie along the rail through the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly
second best. RUNAWAY HENNY broke back and outward, void of early foot, improved while saving ground into the stretch, proved no match for the top
two, fully extended to narrowly hold the show. BOSTON FLAT OUT one paced after moving out three wide, continued in the three path into the lane, roused,
outkicked for the show spot while also not a threat to the top pair. DEBS PRAYER broke outward, was straightened to race in the second flight outside, four
wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick. CHIEF THE GREAT last to leave, failed to menace. FINNLEYS ENCORE broke on top, set or forced the pace
in the two path, stopped from between the top two turning for home, continued to rapidly back up in the drive, jogged in.

Footnotes
LIL ALLIE DANCER never far back while outside, vied three wide into the lane, dueled into the stretch, put the other speed away inside the furlong grounds
and edged clear, held the runner up safe late. MAGGIE TRUE in mid pack for three furlongs off the inside, came three wide into the stretch, angled out to
midtrack when straightened for home, took over the second spot late while slowly getting to the winner. JUST A BANDIT within striking distance while racing
toward the inside, continued to save ground turn, closest entering the stretch then failed to produce a winning kick late. LOVELY CHARLIE broke alertly,
narrowly set the pace inside, weakened in the drive. BLUSHING BELLA broke back, improved position slightly well off the inside while never dangerous.
HONEST TINA popped stall doors prior to the start, broke back, four wide through the turn, went evenly in the drive in lacking a rally. ALOHA KAI remained
always back. PEGGYS OUEST pressed the pace for a half in the two path, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
TOOBADSOSAD in the second flight up the backstretch while racing outside, four out to five wide in the turn, lugged in nearing midstretch, challenged
outside the two leaders and drove clear. MASTER KEV within striking distance early toward the inside, steered out to be three wide late in the turn,
challenged on the outside turning for home, brushed with TAPPED TO THE MAX with a furlong to run, could not match the winner late, edged clear for the
place spot. TAPPED TO THE MAX with the early pace from the start, dueled in the two path through the turn, between rivals into the lane, brushed with the
runner up a furlong out inside that one, weakened, comfortably saved the show. ADIEU LE CHAT void of any early foot, continued well back in the turn,
swung out a bit awkwardly turning for home, showed some belated interest down the middle of the strip to finish up rather willingly. TOTALLY ACQUITTED
forwardly placed early, fell back in the turn then went evenly in the drive. GRAND PRADO broke toward the front, narrowly showed the way early, dueled
through the turn, faltered in the drive while remaining closest to the inside. EL WARD lacked speed while racing outside, raced five wide through the turn,
improved position slightly without posing a serious threat. HERMS CROWN made little impact in remaining back. B W P SPECIAL had little left for the drive.
ONE TIME GEM in the second flight early, began a steady fade before three furlongs.

Footnotes
SHE'S GONE D'WILD broke with the leaders, vied between horses out of the chute, fell back off the first flight into the turn, briefly waited behind that group
turning for home, split foes three wide into the stretch, powered well clear. MISS UNDERRATED also broke well, with the pace between horses, narrowly
held the advantage turning for home, proved no match for the winner in the final furlong, clear for the place. EZEE ENOUGH with the pace exiting the chute,
vied three wide into and through most of the turn, four wide into the lane, came back to save the show, no threat to the top two. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA
broke alertly, set or forced the pace four five furlongs closest to the inside, faltered in the drive. STAR PRADO bumped with MISS LOVEINSKY at the break,
raced back off the pace, moved outside, floated five wide into the lane, lacked a closing response. MY MADELYNS ON last away, trailed for a half, not a
threat in the drive. MISS LOVEINSKY bumped then steadied at the start, finished early, well back.

RICK void of speed off the inside, advanced three wide in some traffic second turn, split foes when straightened for home, bid inside the winner, outkicked
by that one late, held sway for the place. WOMAN WITH A BOOK devoid of speed for six furlongs, moved to far outside, came seven wide into the lane,
rallied while remaining widest through the straight. PURIM KING hopped at the start to be last away, raced back, also was seven wide turning for home,
improved position in the run to the wire. IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT within striking distance off the inside, advanced when called on for run to challenge four
wide into the stretch, faltered the final furlong. KILLEEN in the second flight, remained in a forward position far turn, came five wide into the lane and also
lacked a closing punch. GO FOR MOONSHINE forwardly placed early, fell back, in some traffic turning for home, came up empty for the stretch run as well.
FLASHING ANGELBABY pressed early, dueled into the far turn in the two path, gave way when the real running began entering the stretch. BIG CANE

Footnotes
RANDY PAUL unhurried for five furlongs, began to advance off the inside far turn, three wide into the lane, engaged the leader soon after, wore that rival
down while fully extended to the wire. LITTLE TOE away in good order, pressed early, dueled in the two path the middle half, disposed of the other speed to
be clear late in the final turn, responded when the winner came alongside in upper stretch, proved stubborn to the end, clear best of the others. SHIP
STALKER settled off the pace inside, closer in some traffic entering the stretch, shifted out for room in upper stretch, dropped back to the inside, finished up
best of the rest. ADONIS CREED chased the dueling leaders while racing off the inside, bit closer entering the stretch, had little left for the drive. FLATTER
THE QUEEN moved up to set the early pace inside, dueled up the backstretch and far turn, gave way midway on the final bend.

Footnotes
OUR PRINCE with the early pace, fell back off the first flight a bit into the turn three wide, in some traffic late in the turn, moved out to be four wide into the
stretch, challenged past the furlong marker while drifting in and lightly bumping CLOSING AMERICA, was straightened and drove well clear. KING BAYOU
in the second flight along the inside, also encountered some traffic late in the final turn, steered out to be four wide for the drive, up for the place when clear,
no threat to the winner. JENNOVODKA lacked speed for a half, four wide exiting the turn, steadied in some traffic past mistretch, steered a bit to the inside
and finished with good determination to earn the show. CLOSING AMERICAN broke sharp,pressed the issue early, vied three wide through the turn,
narrowly showed the way upper stretch, bumped lightly with the winner midstretch, weakened. GOLDEN PALACE broke back, lacked speed early, improved
a bit while two wide through the turn, flattened out a bit in the late going to close a position or two while closest to the inside. SILENT CRY fell back to trail
after the start, came three wide out of the turn, improved position and also flattened out a bit late. TOO MUCH BOURBON in mid pack while outside, five
wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick. SUPERCONDUCTOR settled outside, five wide through the bend, tired in the drive. HIGHLY CENTSABLE
narrowly set the pace while off the inside and between rivals, faltered through the stretch. CASTLEMAN with the pace along the inside, continued to vie
through the turn, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
MISTY DAY outrun in the early going, patiently handled toward the inside late in the turn, got through into the straight, steered out then kicked down the
leader with good late energy. AMEERAH B bothered start, quickly recovered to race with the pace inside, continued to vie along the rail through the turn,
shook off the other speed to be well clear when straightened for home, could not contain the winner, remained comfortably clear of the others. SPIDER
LEGS with the early pace outside, pressed three wide through the turn, weakened gradually in the drive, narrowly saved the show. THE AURELIA FACTOR
in the second flight outside in the run up the backstretch, four wide through the turn, lacked the needed closing response while remaining widest in the drive.
RACIN PRAYER contested the issue up front for three furlongs while between horses and faltered. DISTRACTOR FACTOR broke well, fell back off the
pace, turned in an even effort in lacking a closing response. MINERTIME broke out to bother AMEEREAH B then was finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
HALF HEROINE fell back after breaking with the field, two path into the lane, traffic past the furlong marker, dove inside a sixteenth out for room, split foes
late, up in time. CRYPTO BRAVE lacked speed, came four wide into the lane, moved out a bit further, finished willingly outside to narrowly miss. CAMP
HALO raced in mid pack inside, continued to save ground through the turn, rallied up the rail, late bid, not enough in the final strides. RARE ONE broke out
to bother BLESSED VILLANA, pressed early outside, dueled through the turn in the two path, continued to narrowly show the way past the furlong marker,
gave ground grudgingly to the wire. BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL pressed the issue early inside, vied through the turn, gradually weakened through the stretch
while drifting out. PEACH'S SWAN SONG void of speed, passed tiring rivals while not a threat. PRAY FOR LISA with the early pace off the inside, shuffled
back from between horses into the turn, had little left for the drive. ENOUGH HEART five wide trip through, also failed to menace. BLESSED VILLANA
bothered at the start, lacked speed, raced five wide while still back through the turn, made little impact in the drive. GIDDY UP GEAUX trailed most of the
way while showing little. MAK'S ALARM tired while racing four wide.
