Footnotes
FAITHFUL NEIGHBOR led inside of rivals before drawing off in the stretch under mild urging. ESKENDEREYAS DREAM stalked inside, bid between foes
on the far turn and nabbed the place while no match for the winner. ZANESVILLE stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the quarter pole but couldn't gain
late. GOOD GOOD raced inside, moved out around a foe on the far turn, bid at the quarter pole, then had no late gain. FLAT OUT FAST angled five wide in
the stretch and improved position. MYSTIC TIGER pressed the pace in the three path but had no late bid. HOMEVIEW pressed the pace in the two path for
a half mile and gave way. THE HALF-MILE TIME WAS OMITTED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.

CHOCTAW BINGO stumbled at the start to be four back, recovered well to contest the pace three wide on the tur, then went clear in the stretch under
steady pressure. SHINE DOWN was bumped at the start, had a clear lead, was challenged by the winner and couldn't match strides with that one. WAIT
FOR NAIROBI broke in at the start, stalked in the four path, then had a mild late bid. TANQURETTE pressed in the three path, then faded in the stretch.
LINK IN FRONT raced evenly inside. SHES MY TREASURE stalked inside, angled four wide at the quarter pole, then faded. INCESSANT saved ground,
then faded in the stretch. ROYALANDTOULOUSE was not a factor. NOBLES FEELINGS and LUCKY SHORE were off awkwardly. BROOKLYNS A

Footnotes
CUBBIE BEAR vied early between foes, bid at the three-eighths pole, dueled inside of a rival and drew off under confident handling. PREMIUM PASSION
vied inside, then faded in the stretch. REAL BELLA pressed in the four path early, bid at the half-mile pole for a short lead, dueled outside of the winner but
was no match in the drive. CRAFTY JUSTICE saved ground, then had no late bid. ONE SMART PRINCESS vied early in the three path before fading.
SUNSET VALLEY passed tired rivals. FLAT OUT MINKIE hit the gate, stalked in the three path, then faded in the stretch. CAMBIO was not a factor.

Footnotes
STRONG TIDE tracked from midpack two wide, advanced in the four path around the far turn before coming into the lane five wide, drove past the leaders
approaching the furlong pole, and drew off in the final stages. CASH LOGISTICS raced far off of the pace in the two to three path around both turns, waited
patiently through the far turn before swinging to the five path turning for home to be just behind STRONG TIDE, then chased that foe home to prove second
best. LEADING THE CHARGE stalked along the inside from the pocket, split foes two wide turning for home, but lacked a kick in upper stretch, got
outfinished by outer foes in midstretch, then just held show at the wire. NUTTY TRAIN saved ground around both turns while midpack, shifted three wide at
the furlong pole, and kept on for a minor share. MAJOR SPARKS saved ground while far off of the pace, and improved mildly along the rail through the lane.
TWO LAST WORDS raced far off of the pace in the three path, shifted six wide in midstretch, and failed to factor. MAI TAI'S GEM stalked three to four wide,
but weakened on his left lead through the lane. HERE COMES TREY prompted the pace two wide, but weakened three wide and behind horses turning for
home. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK set the pace along the inside, but was headed in upper stretch, and wilted thereafter.

AZURITA stalked the pace four wide, inched forward three wide around the turn to produce a bid in upper stretch, and drew off approaching the furlong
pole. BIG BLUE EMU dueled for the lead inside of a rival, but proved no match for a wider for in upper stretch, then just held place at the wire. PLAYFUL
JUSTICE saved ground off of the pace, shifted from the three to the five path in midstretch, then produced a mild rally outside of foes, but missed place.
CAKE INA CAN tracked from midpack five to four wide, chased AZURITA into the lane, but awkwardly changed leads in upper stretch and was quickly
outpaced by that foe, then kept on, but was outfinished for a minor reward. BROOKVILLE STORM prompted the pace three wide, but clipped heels at the
seven sixteenths pole, and subsequently weakened. RUSHING TIME dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened in upper stretch, and was eased through
the late stages. MYA played no factor. DANGEROUS GIRL trailed early on and failed to make an impact. ENGLISH RULE was never involved.

Footnotes
NOTHINGBUTFLOWERS cleared inner foes passing the wire for the first time. opened up and managed a loose lead down the backstretch and into the
lane, then tired in the late stages, but lasted to safely hold MINTCHOCOLATECHIP at bay. MINTCHOCOLATECHIP stalked the leader three to two wide
around the first turn, chased that loose foe around the far turn, sustained a grinding advance through the late stages, but only produced a mild gain and did
not have enough to catch the tiring leader. DONTYOUREMEMBER trailed along the inside, shifted to the four path into the far turn, then to the six path
turning for home, and rallied willingly outside of foes for a minor reward. TIMELESS ROSE tracked from midpack in the four path, got a bit keen in the latter
half of the first turn, then tracked three wide around the far turn, but failed to menace while hanging on her left lead through the lane, and got outfinished for
show in the final sixteenth. SHES THE CAUSE was caught five to four wide around the first turn while far off of the pace, came into the five wide, but was
outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch, then stayed on mildly. MISTY EXPRESS stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid, and weakened late.
KANFU tracked from midpack two wide, but steadily faded into the far turn and failed to factor thereafter. VIOLANE lunged inwards at the start, saved
ground while off the pace around both turns, but failed to respond to pressure around the far turn, and was not persisted with inside of foes through the lane.
COPPER NICKEL was forwardly placed three wide, but weakened in upper stretch. FORBIDDEN FRUIT was outrun. Due to a timer malfunction, the seven
furlong time was omitted.

Footnotes
R B BANNER stalked two wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, dueled with his inner game foe through midstretch, then edged an advantage
passing the sixteenth pole. R SOARING LIGHT set the pace along the inside, dug in gamely inside of R B BANNER turning for home, but was bested by
that foe passing the sixteenth pole. STRONG WORDS had a slow start and trailed the field to the turn, rallied five wide turning for home, sustained his bid
and was gaining on the leaders in the late stages, but ran out of ground. IT'S THE SUNRISE tracked from midpack four wide, advanced to striking range
three wide turning for home, and kept on while getting outfinished by an outer foe for show. DOC'S BLUE TIPPER was squeezed between horses at the
start, raced off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four path turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch, then failed to
menace. LUCKY B broke in and caused an inner foe to be squeezed, chased the pace three wide and between horses, but weakened turning for home.
BLUESKIESSMILNATME broke outwards and caused an outer foe to be squeezed, pulled along the inside of foes to a stalking position down the
backstretch, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. HEZA GLITTER was no factor.
