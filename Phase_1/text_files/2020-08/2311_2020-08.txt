Footnotes
DRIFT AWAY had no speed, bid three then four wide to the stretch, responded when set down and closed steadily to be along in time. DR WYSONG had
no speed, raced off the rail to the stretch then eased out and closed with a late surge to get second. AMBER LOUISE pressed the pace two wide to the
stretch, rallied to engage PRINCESS ASHLYN in mid stretch, battled on late but could not stall the winner and was nailed for second. PRINCESS ASHLYN
had the best speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, dueled AMBER LOUISE to deep stretch then was outfinished. BRILLIANT BIRD tracked the
leaders three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. LUCKY ANTARES also was tracking the pace, raced two wide to the stretch
then came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
FLICFLAC was outsprinted to the turn, raced two then three wide then angled out sharply for room in upper stretch, rallied once clear and closed willingly to
prevail. CARTELLATE pressed the pace early, got shuffled back nearing the turn, saved ground to the stretch then finished willingly for the place. OUR
BOLD PRINCE broke off balance, recovered and tracked the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch, dueled to deep stretch then was
outfinished. THISONESFORDAN had good speed, dueled off the rail to the stretch, got overtaken leaving mid stretch and weakened. DARK PROOF had no
speed, raced three then four wide on the turn, shifted out for room into the stretch but lacked the needed late response. CONTINENTAL UNION tracked the
pace three wide to the stretch but got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. THUNDER BOAT had no speed and was not a factor. ARC NATION broke
slow and trailed to the stretch then was not a threat. SHARP WARNING pressed the pace three wide to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
TOP OF THE GAME hustled to the lead, set the pace to the second turn, was inside and turned back UNLAWFUL ACT to the stretch then dug in
determinedly to hold. UNLAWFUL ACT tracked the winner to the half, bid three wide to loom a threat on the second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch then
kept on late. IMPERATOR pressed the winner from the rail to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then was also outrun to mid stretch but
continued on to close the gap. SHOT OF A LIFETIME settled mid pack to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then was also gaining ground late.
LIFELINE was outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. RATE FOR
ME tracked the winner to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch and was also closing some late. SOUTHERN THUNDER trailed to the stretch then
showed mild interest in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BEAR CHUM (AUS) pressed the leader three wide to the stretch, rallied to take over in mid stretch then held off PASSIONATE REWARD stubbornly.
PASSIONATE REWARD was chasing to the turn, came two wide to the stretch then had the inside track in the drive and finished willingly. DADDYSPRIZE
stalked the pace early, was fanned four deep on the turn and had a mild late bid. LYMEBYRD broke a bit slow, trailed to the turn, was two wide to the
stretch and gained some in the late stages. CROSS CREEK had no speed, circled four wide on the turn but could not make an impact in the drive.
BOUNDFORJAMAICA got outsprinted to the turn then saved ground to no avail. SUNSET DRAGUNN hustled to the front, set the pace in the two path to
the stretch then was collared nearing mid stretch and tired. TOUCHED BY AUTISM had no speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PLATE SIDE was outrun early, lugged inward nearing the seven sixteenths and bothered TANNERS PRIDE, raced two wide to the stretch then shifted out
for room, rallied when set down and closed resolutely to prevail. WHOA BUDDY chased the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded in the drive and was
second best. SUNRISE JOURNEY hustled to contest the pace two wide to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then was outfinished late. TINA'S
EXCHANGE had no speed, got fanned four wide to the stretch and finished willingly late. TANNERS PRIDE also had no speed, checked when crowded by
the winner at the seven sixteenths, raced two wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. ARGOSY FLEET got outrun to the turn, raced two
wide to the stretch and closed a gap without threatening. NUTTY SIERRA was chasing the leaders three wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive.
TIM'S BUDDY hustled to dispute the pace inside of SUNRISE JOURNEY, stayed on to mid stretch then tired. POTENTE ALBA was chasing to the turn then
was outrun to the stretch and also tired.
