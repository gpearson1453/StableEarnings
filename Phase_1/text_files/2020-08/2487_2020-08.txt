Footnotes
CAPTAIN MAD JACK tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid four wide into the lane, then drew off and was kept to the
task. CITY STORM well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, then was no match for the winner and
held the place safe. BAYSIDER allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, steadied on heels, angled
out and edged up for the show. COLONEL TALBOT mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and got up for a
share. BANTU sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and faded. DAHOG allowed to
settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path and evened out. THISAINTJUMPSTREET mid pack, saved ground through the turn,
came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. SIGNS OF GREATNESS rated outside, saved ground on the two path through
the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch and faded. TRULY STELLAR ran evenly for a half and had no rally.
