PRIDE OF WILKO well rated emerged a threat on the far turn extending from mid track down the lane needing all to prevail. BONITA SPRINGS stalked the
pace rallying to lead on the far turn digging in near the rail down the stretch proving game to the end. ART THIEF lagging early would rally on the far turn
coming six wide down the stretch vying willingly late. BLUEBERRY SHINE slow early proved no factor. J Z'S DIVA sent clear set the pace through the
backside then weakened on the far turn giving way in upper stretch. Due to a timer malfunction the six furlong split was hand-timed.
