STUCK IN VEGAS well placed from the outside early, inched closer entering the second turn, responded to duel through the drive and was just up the final
yards. SENATOR CON broke sharp from between foes, gained a clear early margin into the first turn, dueled up the backstretch, remained engaged
entering the drive but was outfinished. LUCKY INFERNO stalked the early pace from the outside, dueled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the
drive but was outfinished for the place. RUN ROCKET bumped at the start, chased the early pace inside then came up empty in the drive. CONFEDERATE
YELL was never a factor. HASHTAG SPEED bobbled at the start, broke in bumping with RUN ROCKET, chased the early pace and tired. M V P MOOKIE
flashed early speed and faded.

but had nothing left. BEGGARTHYSTAR was no factor. COLOSSAL STORM had a steady fade. IRONIC was no threat.
