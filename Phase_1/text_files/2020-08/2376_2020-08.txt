Footnotes
WEEKEND AT LAST always within striking distance while saving ground for a half, angled outside the leader, responded with a burst of speed through the
final furlong to make the lead late and won as much the best. BACCARAT away alertly, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner
while clearly second best. BEACH BABE vied for the lead five wide and went evenly. CAUSE OF LOVE inside, angled out for racing room nearing the top of
the stretch, was shut off then passed tiring ones. RACEY WEEKEND bore out at the start, was well back into the stretch, surged two wide through upper
stretch, ran up on heels just past the furlong marker, altered course to the rail then finished evenly. BAINBRIDGE pressed the pace three wide into the
stretch then gave way. JUDY'S PRIDE prompted the pace four wide, drifted out entering the stretch and tired. FOUR SHARPS was outrun. SPEAKING
VOLUMES stumbled inward at the start and was never involved. THE CALICO LADY pressed the pace two wide into the turn then stopped.

FURTHERINSTRUCTION stalked the pace along the inside for a half, shifted out three wide entering the stretch, dug in under a strong hand ride and got up
in time between horses. OBSESSIONSOPTIMIST pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, gained a narrow advantage before the furlong marker, dueled
to the wire and just missed hanging on. EVEN KEELED was bumped at the start, settled with the second flight two wide, drifted to the eight path entering
the stretch then closed willingly. CANDY CLASSIC was hustled from the gate to set a pressured pace until mid stretch then weakened late. LITTLE
BLAKER never far back, offered a bid three wide on the turn then came up empty. WINGS OF FREEDOM bore in at the start bumping EVEN KEELED and
was no factor. TYPOTHETAE pressed the pace three wide into the turn then faltered.

Footnotes
LEISHLANICK away alertly, set all the pace, shook clear on the turn and into the stretch and prevailed under strong handling. MI BELLA was bumped hard
at the start, allowed to settle then closed determinedly along the rail through the stretch. SEE YOU AT THE BAR stalked the pace towards the inside, drifted
out to the five path entering the stretch then came on again late. LIGHTNING MISS was bumped hard, forced into MI BELLA, stumbled at the start then
trailed into the stretch and finished with good courage. YACHT went evenly. SPARKLING JUSTICE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then
weakened. VAL'S DISTINCTION bore in badly bumping rivals hard at the start then no threat. QUALITY H TWO O vied for the lead four then three wide,
inched closer on the turn then got out badly and stopped.
