Footnotes
MARGARITA MUNNDY raced in striking position while three wide, advanced on the far turn and rallied while three wide in the stretch. OUR CLOVER GAL
seized command from the outset, held well into the stretch and was reeled in. REGAN'S WAY chased the pacesetter and stayed on. KYLIES
COLLEGEFUND outrun early, commenced her bid far on the turn, was angled three wide and showed good late energy. TIFFANY'S GAL ducked out at the
start bumping TIZAMISSILE, was outpaced while four wide and could not menace. TIZAMISSILE broke sharply, was slammed into early, stumbled as a
result and did not factor thereafter. TANGALANG retreated.
