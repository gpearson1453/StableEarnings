VENTRILOQUISM was away alertly and dueled on the lead from the rail, shook clear in the stretch and remained clear late under firm handling. MASTER
GUNS dropped to the rail soon after the start, saved all the ground, finished well and was second best. HIDE THE RANSOM vied for the lead with the
winner and held well in the drive. MCCLURE pressed the pace throughout and needed more late. MY BEAU steadied slightly early while between horses
soon after the start and was no threat. A SONG FOR ARCH raced five wide and had no rally. WIN YA WIN flashed brief foot, then gave way.
