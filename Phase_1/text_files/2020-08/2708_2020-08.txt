Footnotes
MONCHICHI pressed leader along the rail on the backstretch, entered turn on leaders flank throughout the turn, took command approaching the eighth pole
and gamely held off closers under steady urging. THICK SMOKE settled towards the back of the pack on the backstretch, made steady progress entering
the turn and through the turn along the inside, made a menacing rally but could not get by leader late. ROBBERYINPROGRESS chased leaders two wide
along the backstretch, entered turn three wide, loomed up to leader at the eight pole, and lacked needed response in the lane finishing a flattening third.
BANJO GIRL off slow, had to steady due to rival coming in while in the chute, entered main track at the rear of the field, made steady progress on the
backstretch and into the turn, finished willingly under steady urging while being a distant fourth. STORMY SUN led outside of rival on the backstretch,
entered turn two wide while being pressed throughout, started to weaken late in the turn and lost lead at the eighth pole, asked for run in the stretch but
continued to weakened in the lane. BLUEGRASS BOOGIE stumbled at the start, quickly recovered and tracked leaders along the rail, entered turn off the
rail and started to lose ground, entered stretch in the three path and lacked needed response and providing no bid.
