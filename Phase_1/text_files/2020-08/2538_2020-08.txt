Footnotes
JEANIE'S ANGEL saved ground just behind the leaders for six furlongs, was guided outside REVVEDUPLIKEADEUCE past the quarter-pole, took
command in upper stretch and drove clear. CACTUS KITTEN was four wide on the first turn, continued widest through the middle stages, moved in a path
advancing near the stretch, and was along outside for second while not a threat to the winner. REVVEDUPLIKEADEUCE crossed over clearing to the early
lead, rated along through an even pace, and yielded through the lane inside. HERCULINA settled in the middle of the field two then three wide for six
furlongs, moved out a bit for the drive and gained mildly on her left lead. MOR BREEZE ran up behind horses and checked sharply on the rail past the
three-eighths, moved to the far outside in the stretch and improved position. BORROWED ANGEL prompted the pace two wide to the far turn, and began to
fade before reaching the stretch. MARICOPA was no factor through a three-wide run on the turns. MARIANNA QUEEN raced toward the inside and was
never prominent. REINA CARIBE lacked room between SASSY GIDGET and HERCULINA and steadied back at the start, and remained in arrears. SASSY
GIDGET chased outside the leaders for a bit more than a half-mile, and dropped far back.

MIGHTY THOMAS sped clear soon after the start, rated along inside to the stretch and widened under a drive. DREAMING THOUSAND broke out giving
FREELANCE a solid bump at the start, raced three wide and finished willingly to best the others. MINDSHIP Q was outsprinted after an alert break, steadied
slightly on the rail past the half-mile marker, came off the inside leaving the turn, and was just up inside NINJA for the show. NINJA chased outside MIGHTY
THOMAS to the stretch, and lost the show minimally urged through the final 50 yards. FREELANCE absorbed a hard bump from DREAMING THOUSAND
at the start and dropped back to trail, and remained outrun four wide. TURPIAL bounced off the left side of the gate at the start, showed brief speed and
faded steadily inside.

Footnotes
R MAN JOE settled off the leading trio and outside REMASTER around the turn, came four wide for the drive, rallied steadily and edged away through the
late stages. CITRUS BURST steadied on the rail past the half-mile pole, moved out to the two-path on the turn, shifted out further in the stretch and finished
strongly just inside the winner. REMASTER (IRE) stayed in range to the stretch, shifted in looking for room behind the leaders a sixteenth out, and was
outkicked for second. GRAN OLD PARR brushed the right side of the gate and was away slowly, moved up three wide around the turn, and continued to
make progress on the far outside late. BAHAMIAN BEAT bumped with U S S COLTON at the start, vied up front inside HENRY'S WORLD and
ALLEGEDLY PERFECT to the stretch, and weakened in the last eighth of a mile. ALLEGEDLY PERFECT contested the pace three wide to the stretch, and
gave way through the last furlong. SURPRISE FACTOR saved ground outrun to the stretch, and was moving well on the rail when stopped cold behind
BAHAMIAN BEAT a sixteenth out. HENRY'S WORLD argued the pace between horses for three furlongs, and checked behind REMASTER while giving
way in deep stretch. MR NAPPY lost his footing and steadied at the start, and was outrun three wide. U S S COLTON bumped with BAHAMIAN BEAT at the
start, and retreated inside around the turn.

Footnotes
GRACE'S DRAMA got brushed by CHIQUI THE GREY at the start, prompted the pace between horses, took over outside NOTHINS FREE coming to the
quarter-pole, drew well clear through mid stretch, drifted out briefly outside the sixteenth-pole and stayed well in command. PAYNTER FEST bobbled at the
start, recovered to track outside the leaders three then four wide, and was clearly second best. CHIQUI THE GRAY broke out brushing GRACE'S DRAMA,
moved off the inside late on the turn, and lacked the needed closing response. DARLINDIVA was no factor two wide. NOTHINS FREE set the pace inside,
relinquished the lead to the winner just before completing six furlongs, and tired. KWAINA tossed her head slightly at the break and came out slow, and was
outrun inside. NYMUE'S TREASURE dropped far back approaching the stretch, and jogged in. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
BRIGHT VENEZUELAN was outrun two wide to the stretch, moved to the four-path rallying through the furlong grounds, and collared DAHLONEGA from
outside late. DAHLONEGA advanced inside around the turn, moved outside past the quarter-pole drawing a bead on ASSAIL, reached the front outside that
one in deep stretch but was overhauled in the closing yards. SWEETLY MAID was outrun to the stretch, kicked in finding her best stride past the furlong
marker, lacked room behind the top two in the final stages and was being gathered up at the wire. SPEED STAR chased between horses early, moved
inside looming a threat on the rail near the eighth-pole, but did not have enough. TAYLOR'S IN ORBIT took a hard bump from NAPA RULES at the break
and dropped well back, went three then four wide around the turn, and gained some ground on the far outside. NAPA RULES broke in bumping TAYLOR'S
IN ORBIT solidly, waited inside near the quarter-pole, made minimal headway once straightened away for the drive, then lacked room inside SPEED STAR
and was put on hold through the last sixteenth of a mile. DISTINCTLY BLUE raced three then four wide around the turn, and lacked a solid response.
ASSAIL set the pace inside, and faltered entering the final furlong. POCKET OF CANDY pressed the pace two then three wide to the top of the stretch, and
gave way.

Footnotes
R PRIVATE JET grabbed the early lead inside, was under a drive by late on the turn with CATCH ON EMOTIONAL breathing down his neck, and
responded to kept that rival at bay through the stretch. CATCH ON EMOTIONAL chased outside the winner from the outset, issued a stern challenge
five-sixteenths out, could not get by and was much best of the others. DOC AMSTER bumped with EXTRA DOUGH early, saved ground into the turn,
moved out three wide near the quarter-pole, and made no headway through the lane. MASCABRONI was a step slow at the break and lacked room behind
EXTRA DOUGH, saved ground outrun to the stretch, angled to the far outside and improved past tired horses. TANK 'EM DOWN failed to menace three
wide. EXTRA DOUGH broke out, bumped with DOC AMSTER early, moved inside around the turn and dropped back. HALO'S DANCE checked along the
rail near the five-eighths pole, and dropped far back. CHAMBERLAIN chased outside R PRIVATE JET early, and was finished before completing a half-mile.

Footnotes
ARCHIVERO vied early inside SLICK STAR, dropped back entering the turn, moved out two wide and rebid through mid stretch, and was along in time.
SLICK STAR cleared off from ARCHIVERO leaving the backstretch and moved inside, led to 70 yards out, and yielded. REAGAN'S HEART broke slowly
and was outrun to the stretch two wide, split horses rallying past the eighth-pole, and gained late outside the top two. MY BROTHERSLEDGE was outrun
three wide to the lane, and gained belatedly on the far outside. KING'S CASTLE saved ground throughout, and finished evenly unable to muster the needed
response. ANOTHER SOFTBALL stayed close three then four wide to the top of the stretch, and lacked a solid bid. FANTASIZING broke a step slow,
lacked room behind STORM THE BRIDGE and SLICK START and steadied back, trailed for nearly three furlongs, and gained mildly outside. STORM THE
BRIDGE raced in midpack two wide early, moved out in the stretch and had no rally. LAWYER DRILL tracked outside the early leaders, and tired after
three-eighths of a mile. TIDE OF THE DESERT checked sharply near the three-eighths, was in the process of being pulled up leaving the quarter-pole,
veered out erratically unseating the rider at the top of the stretch, briefly ran loose before being apprehended, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
SANDYS BLAZE stayed close early on the rail, slipped through to take over inside RICKI TICKI TAFFI at the top of the stretch, and bounded away staying
on his left lead. MASERATI MAN pressed the pace outside RICKI TICKI TAFFI, bumped solidly with that rival in mid stretch, and went clear for the place.
RICKI TICKI TAFFI dashed to the front after the start, came under attack from both sides turning for home, bumped hard with MASERATI MAN just past the
eighth-pole, and gave way. UNCAPTURED KING hit the right side of the gate coming out, then lacked room behind RICKI TICKI TAFFI and steadied back
to last, and posed no late threat on the far outside. GEMO raced three then four wide around the turn, and faded in the stretch. MUKULWITZ saved ground
to no avail.

Footnotes
ALASTOR got clipped from behind by ISLE OF MAN first time through the stretch, rated along establishing an even pace, shook off SULEMAN leaving the
far turn and stayed clear all out. ROBIN TEAM SHOW delayed the start several minutes very difficult to load, checked behind CALL BROS away from the
gate, took up behind a fallen rider first time through the stretch, advanced four wide past the quarter-pole, and rallied gamely outside the winner. SULEMAN
swerved out to avoid a fallen rider first time through the stretch, prompted ALASTOR from outside, had aim turning for home, lugged in a sixteenth out and
had to be handled cautiously behind the winner. CALL BROS broke out in front of ROBIN TEAM SHOW, moved off the inside to the three-path around the
far turn, and finished evenly. SOUTH POINTE DRIVE stumbled at the start, leapt over the fallen rider and took up sharply first time through the stretch,
saved ground and did not threaten. PLENUM was keyed up and steadied inside ALASTOR entering the first turn, went along kept in by the loose horse up
the backstretch, and dropped back after six furlongs. IN HONOR OF ARTIE leapt over the fallen rider and checked inside early, and never reached
contention. BOURBONROX prompted the pace outside ALASTOR, and was finished midway on the far turn. ISLE OF MAN clipped heels behind ALASTOR
and stumbled sharply unseating the rider first time through the stretch, ran loose with the field around the course, was apprehended and ponied off. THERE
WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUN THROUGH THE STRETCH THE FIRST TIME BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.
