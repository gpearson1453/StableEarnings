Footnotes
CELEE'S LAST TE showed the best speed from shortly after the start drew clear at the head of the stretch and won as much the best while kept to task.
BUDDY NINER popped the gate but then steadily faded saved ground along the rail and came through on the inside and was up for second. DONNAS
FINAL WORD chased the speed in the two path but tired in the stretch and held third. LAST CALL LEROY was able to get to the rail up the backstretch
came through on the inside and was able to get a minor share. ROUSING RUBBLE came very wide entering the stretch and could not make up the needed
ground. EVERYDAYISAGOODDAY was well back for much of the race came four wide entering the stretch and passed tired foes. TAZ raced wide on the
turn and was fanned six wide turning for home and could not make up ground. KNOCK ON IT was quickest from the gate but settled along the inside and
faded on the turn.

Footnotes
KAIN'S LADY was well off the pace along the inside up the backstretch and into the turn came out to the two path to challenge for the lead in the stretch and
steadily drew clear. ANGELS ON HIGH came five wide on the turn and was clearly second while never a serious threat to the winner. FLASHIN THE CASH
was last out of the gates but quickly got into stride and made the lead while saving the rail led to the stretch call and then tired late. FAITH IN EXCESS
raced five wide on the turn and made a mild bid for a minor share. GRAY BRIDE came eight wide entering the stretch and could not make up ground.
ULTIMATE INDIAN was quick out of the gates but could not get to the rail and raced in the two path and then backed up on the turn. CITI SHINER raced
four wide in an early speed duel and faded on the turn. SCOTIA QUEEN was quick early in the three path in the four horse speed duel and was the first to
give way.

Footnotes
ALL FOR TRUTH was quickest from the gates and when the horses on the inside did not break well, was able to get to the rail was challenged on the turn
but drew clear through the stretch. HE COULD made a bid in the two path on the turn and through the lane and was up for second while not a threat to the
winner. SOUTHERN MOJO raced in the two path on the turn came a bit wider entering the stretch and could not hold second. CASUALITY raced mid pack
and lacked a winning rally when asked. GET ER DONE was caught four wide the entire race and could not make up ground. SHEPHERD'S PRIDE was
three wide in a speed duel and tired in the stretch. HOT BLOODED SONG raced along the inside while well off the pace and could not make up ground.
ONE KEY lost his footing at the break and trailed throughout.

ROLL OUT showed the best early speed into the first turn to take the rail was challenged every step of the way shook clear in mid stretch and held off the
fast closing S S Tank for the win. S S TANK was along the inside for both turns came out for the drive and was getting to the winner but ran out of ground.
MONTANA JACK was challenging for the lead in the two path until the final yards and tired late. DANDY VAN had a two path trip for the first half then came
four wide on the second turn and could not make up ground. FIVE TITLES was away in good order but was having some difficulty in the first turn while
trying to get out dropped well back and was not a factor. ARCH SEEKER was away in good order then was steadied and eased in the first turn and dropped
well back came again up the backstretch but tired in the lane.

Footnotes
SURF KITTEN showed good speed to get to the rail opened a clear lead into the turn and held the margin while challenged in the lane. CHASIN LUCAS
showed good speed along the inside came out for the drive but could not get to the winner while clearly second best. EXTREME CAUTION raced three wide
on the turn to move into contention could not sustain that bid and dropped back through the stretch. LADYSGOTITALL raced in the two path and never
mounted a rally. I CAME TO PRAISE trailed from the outset and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CRAFTY'S LAST had a two path trip around the turn came into contention at the top of the stretch and pulled clear in the final eighth for the victory. LONE
SHOTGUN RIDER showed the best early speed to carve all the fractions but could not go with the winner late while clearly second best. SILIS broke out
sharply away from the gates and bumped was three wide throughout and could not make up the needed ground. CHEROKEE DYNASTY was pinched back
at the break and forced wide on the turn angled in sharply at the head of the stretch but could not make up the needed ground. MICKEY THE MOOCHER
showed good speed in the two path but began to drop back at the head of the stretch. CALL A COP was pinched back at the start and never mounted a
rally. CADILLAC CHROME had a ground saving trip along the inside and faded in the stretch. NEPTUNE'S SEAL stumbled coming out of the gate and
raced five wide the entire race and was not a factor after those issues. THUNDERUPALLEY was in the back the entire race and never a factor.
