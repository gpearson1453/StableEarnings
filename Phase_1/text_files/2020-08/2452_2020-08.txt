urging. UNCAPTURED RUBY chased the pace, rallied outside into the stretch, dug in gamely and was gaining slowly late. BRIDGE TO BROOKLYN raced
off the pace, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside for third. ODRAMARK chased between rivals, moved up inside, then was steadied at
the three eighths marker, continued inside and weakened. ZIP IT JESS got loose before the start and needed a broken rein fixed, then chased inside and
had no rally. LITTLE NATALIA raced off the pace, between rivals at the quarter pole and did not factor. MOON OVER VICTORIA chased outside, raced
three wide on the turn and faded.

furlong and yielded grudgingly at the end. ZINGER pressed the pace racing outside of ANIMAL TRICK, then chased two wide and weakened. FUN
PROSPECT was outrun early, raced inside on the far turn and lacked a rally. THE GREAT LOUDINI broke through the gate prior, raced off the pace, went
four wide on the far turn and had no rally. NICOLE MUNNINGS pulled and was steadied on the first turn, raced off the pace and gave way.
