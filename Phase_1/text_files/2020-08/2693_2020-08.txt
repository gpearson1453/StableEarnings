Footnotes
XTREME LYRA stalked, forged clear into the stretch when called upon and held well thereafter. D'URBAN PARK chased while three wide, was angled in on
the far turn and rallied along the inside in the stretch. CHUCKMATE settled well, commenced his bid on the far turn and lodged a mild three wide rally in the
stretch. MR MIDTOWN sprinted clear, led into the stretch and gave way when headed. NETELA never menaced. MAMBOCELLO was always outrun.
UNCAIL proved no factor. TOAST TIME showed little.
