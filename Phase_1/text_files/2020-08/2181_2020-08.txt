Footnotes
MR. SCISSORS showed good early speed while racing just off the inside down the backstretch, raced along the inside through the stretch and was well
clear late under strong handling. ROUNDABOUT PATROL stalked the pace while racing between rivals, raced two deep and was no match for the winner.
MOONSHINERBOY stalked the early pace, raced four wide through the lane and had no final winning bid. RANCHERO RIDGE stalked the pace while
saving ground and tired. CATS AIN'T PLAYIN was off a step slow, raced far back early and never threatened. THUNDER BLING dropped back early and
failed to respond.

TOMMYTOSHORT pressed the leader from the outside, took command around the far turn and drew off to be well clear under steady handling. GOLDEN
HEAT stalked the pace, raced three wide in the stretch and was no match for the winner. B JS ARCH was slow in the early stages, raced five deep through
the stretch and showed good late interest. SPORTY FLYER stalked the early pace, moved up four wide at the quarter pole and weakened in the drive.
ICEBIRG LET US stalked the leaders down the backstretch, raced four wide just past the eighth pole and had no late response. MORO COOL settled off
the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. GATO DEL BANCO was unhurried early, raced six deep into the lane never
threatened. THREE DAY WEEKEND dropped back early and failed to respond. SILVER AND ACES showed good early speed to set all the pace and tired
readily.

speed, raced just off the inside throughout, dug in late but couldn't off the winner late to finish second best. SHIRL'S READY was allowed to settle early,

and made a mild late gain. FRED'STWIRLINCANDY pressed the leader from the outside and gave way. CARLOS SIXES stalked the pace, raced three
deep at the eighth pole and had late response. INSTAFAMOUS stalked the pace and weakened while racing along the inside. MISTER STRANGE was
