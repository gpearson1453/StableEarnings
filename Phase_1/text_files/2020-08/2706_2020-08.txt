Footnotes
AERODYNAMIC was well placed tracking the leaders inside, moved out three wide responding readily to go after TOO MUCH WAR around the far turn,
took over outside that rival after six furlongs and kicked clear, then held AGUAS COLORADAS safe to the wire. AGUAS COLORADAS stayed close early,
had aim outside the winner turning for home, finished willingly but did not have enough. MOMENTS TO SAVER was outrun for six furlongs, and finished
with good energy in the two-path. GENERIC MARK advanced around the far turn three wide, shifted out to the four-path at the top of the lane, and flattened
out in the final furlong. MONEY FACTOR was outrun to the stretch, and improved position outside late. FOR KICKS lost position inside entering the far turn,
moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. STRONG GEM moved up three wide after six furlongs, but could not sustain the bid. BLAME
THE GODS raced in the second flight and made no impact. TOO MUCH WAR vied outside PLAY THAT TONE early, cleared inside up the backstretch,
could not handle AERODYNAMIC past the quarter-pole and retreated. PLAY THAT TONE brushed the right side of the gate coming away alertly, vied inside
TOO MUCH WAR around the first turn, let that one go after entering the backstretch, and was finished before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
WILLARD broke inward, was between horses and under a drive chasing WESLEY OWEN after a half-mile, stayed on task and wore that rival down past the
sixteenth-pole. WESLEY OWEN sprinted clear soon after the start, rated along going comfortably in the two-path to the stretch, neglected to change leads
and shortened stride through the late stages while able to save the place. SIGNIFIED stayed close three then four wide around the turn, and finished evenly
outside. COURAGE DE LION bumped hard with OLD MAIN at the break and steadied behind WILLARD, went along bottled up behind horses early, moved
out for the drive and gained mildly for the last major share. NIMBLE BEAST came under a ride inside before completing a half, and faded through the drive.
OLD MAIN bumped solidly with COURAGE DE LION at the start, and was outrun three wide. MATCH RUNNER tired four wide before reaching the stretch.
FERGUS BOGEL was finished early inside.

ACT LIKE ARTIE was unhurried inside for a half-mile, moved up comfortably three wide into the far turn, challenged outside LAKE PARIMA with a
quarter-mile remaining, and drew clear through the late stages. LAKE PARIMA set an even pace inside for six furlongs, fought back when confronted by the
winner turning for home, but yielded a sixteenth out. SMIRKOTCH raced forwardly two wide to the stretch, and could not pick up the leaders with an even
finish. LOVE RANGER saved ground early in the second flight, and could not gain through the stretch on the far outside. DIVINE MARTHA stayed close
inside to the far turn, and lacked a solid response. LA GATA NEGRA broke out at the start, raced two wide early, moved out another path into the far turn,
and had no rally. JEANIE VEE tired two wide after a half. CAPTIVANT was bothered by LA GATA NEGRA at the start and away slowly, and raced wide
throughout at the back.

Footnotes
MARKISTAN rallied up three wide three-sixteenths out, collared SAY ADIOS from outside in upper stretch, and drew away ridden out. SAY ADIOS tracked
outside SOLID AS A ROCK early, took over late on the turn without much trouble, could not stave off MARKISTAN after straightening away for the drive,
and ran on best of the others. SOLID AS A ROCK sprinted clear early inside, lost the advantage to SAY ADIOS after completing three furlongs, and
weakened. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA was no factor three wide. LANGUE LIEE was outrun inside. CHANNELED'S ANGEL went wrong just past the
seven-sixteenths pole, lost the rider near the end of the far turn after an unsuccessful attempt at pulling her up, was apprehended and vanned off.

drew off under pressure. EASY DAY vied early inside ROUGH ENTRY, let that one go after a quarter-mile, rebid between horses five-sixteenths out, was no
match for the winner turning for home, and ran on second best. PRINCE IGOR broke slowly, raced two then three wide around the turn, and was along for
the show with an even finish. NO MORE BUSINESS saved ground outrun to the stretch, and improved mildly on the rail. ROUGH ENTRY vied outside
EASY DAY early, cleared into the turn and moved inside, came under attack from two challengers, and steadied inside EASY DAY in the process of giving

in bumping NICHOLAS ROSE, stumbled badly and veered out, raced four wide and was never close. IMMERSION broke in brushing the left side of the gate
and was off slowly, moved outside and dropped far back before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
ESTILO TALENTOSO set a pressured early pace inside, was put to a drive before completing six furlongs as CRUMB BUN came up to her outside, dug in
through a long drive and prevailed while drifting out steadily the last sixteenth of a mile. CRUMB BUN pressed the pace outside ESTILO TALENTOSO,
dialed up the pressure coming to the quarter-pole, battled the length of the stretch and could not get by while being herded out through the late stages.
BELLA CIAO raced between horses heading into the turn, entered the stretch three wide, and gained mildly winding up in the middle of the track outside the
top two. DON'T GET KHOZY raced three then four wide getting urged along past the three-eighths, and had no solid response. RELUCTANT BRIDE
bobbled slightly at the start and was outrun early, came five wide off the turn and could not reach contention. HELPING LISA D was ridden along inside after
five furlongs, and came up empty.

Footnotes
MARVELOUS MARLENE settled in the middle of the field early, moved out three wide with aim at the leaders after six furlongs, dueled outside TAKE ME
AS I AM while on her left lead and attempting to lug in, and proved best late. TAKE ME AS I AM tracked NYSSA from outside for six furlongs, poked a head
in front at the head of the lane, moved to the rail fighting inside MARVELOUS MARLENE through the stretch, and was stubborn to the finish. WEST SIDE
GIRL saved ground in striking range for six furlongs, moved out in the stretch and gained gradually outside the top two. TAP TAP BIRDIE was four wide
leaving the first turn, stayed in the second flight for six furlongs, and improved for the last major share after some bumping and brushing with CRYSTAL
COAST through the lane. CRYSTAL COAST was never in contention, and came in initiating some brushing and bumping with TAP TAP BIRDIE in the
stretch. NYSSA crossed and cleared to the early lead, showed the way for six furlongs inside, and gave way. STARSHIP NTERPRISE raced in striking
range three wide to the far turn, and tired. LOVE IN HER EYES raced three then four wide on the first turn, and was finished after a half-mile. TEN PIN
ALLY hopped at the start and came out a couple lengths behind the next-to-last horse, and was always outrun. YOUR EYES ONLY showed little inside.

Footnotes
PURECRAZIDUDE stumbled at the start, moved swiftly to contention four wide around the turn, took over outside MACHO D'ORO at the top of the stretch
and pulled away. SCAR was outrun early inside, swung to the far outside leaving the turn, and rallied on his left lead to go clear of the others. TONS OF
GOLD raced between horses midway on the turn, moved out to the four-path near the three-sixteenths pole, and finished evenly. MACHO D'ORO prompted
the pace outside MORE THAN USUAL, took a brief lead past the five-sixteenths, got overhauled from outside by the winner a few strides later, and
weakened. I'M MORE READY was no factor three wide. AWESOME PARTY raced three then four wide on the turn, and gave way after six furlongs. MORE
THAN USUAL set the early pace inside, relinquished command five-sixteenths out, and had nothing left. SHANGHAI MOON retreated around the turn
inside. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
EARTH pressed the pace outside STURGEON from the start, stayed on task through the stretch and wore that foe down in the closing strides. STURGEON
set the pace inside, was clear into the final furlong, but could not hold on. HERO TIGER saved ground into the turn, moved off the inside approaching the
stretch, and finished with good courage outside the top two. MARCELINO moved inside approaching the turn, hugged the rail the rest of the way and was
going well too late. GETTININTOMISCHIEF bumped with CHIEF WHITE SOX at the start, and lacked a solid bid two wide. TENACITY ZIP broke slowly and
was outrun for three furlongs, angled well out in the course in upper stretch and made up ground belatedly. I'M CARDINAL hopped at the break and was off
a step slow, recovered to track the leaders in the clear entering the turn, and came up empty three wide at the head of the lane. SOVEREIGN IMPACT was
no factor four wide. PAPACHO was five wide at the back approaching the stretch, and made no headway. CHIEF WHITE SOX bumped with
GETTININTOMISCHIEF at the start, and was finished early three wide. STAR JUANCHO tossed his head at the start and came out behind the field, and
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MIDTOWN ROSE followed behind the leaders in the two-path early, switched out three wide approaching the quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and
held FOREVER MARTA safe under a drive. FOREVER MARTA was outrun for a half-mile, had the three-path coming off the turn, moved further out and
rallied on her left lead to narrow the gap. CHUTZPAH advanced to loom a threat four wide turning for home, could not go with the winner in upper stretch
and was outfinished for second. LET'S BE HONEST hit the left side of the gate at the start, recovered to chase outside BAHAMIAN GIRL, bid between
horses midway on the turn, but faded through the stretch. BAHAMIAN GIRL set the early pace inside, and faded steadily after a half. FAITH N HOPE was
finished early inside. LIL MISS HOTSHOT tracked outside the early leaders three wide, and tired after a half. ROSYJERSEY moved in to the two-path late
on the turn, and tired into the lane.

Footnotes
MISS LORETTA bumped with CULTIVATION at the start, vied for command inside GITANA and OUR LITTLE DEVIL into the turn, shook clear after
three-eighths of a mile, and was driving to stay well in command. CAMELLIA GAL bumped with CULTIVATION at the start, was well placed behind the
embattled leaders on the turn, came four wide into the lane and finished well. GITANA contested the pace between horses for nearly three furlongs, and ran
on to hold the show. FINA had a ground-saving trip, and gained mildly for the last major share. OUR LITTLE DEVIL vied outside MISS LORETTA and
GITANA to midway on the turn, and faded through the drive. MYSTIC MOON failed to menace three wide. TENERIFE MOON broke slowly and trailed to the
stretch, and went by faders well out in the course. KAYLA'S TUNE broke slowly, and was never involved. WAR GODDESS was outrun three wide.
CULTIVATION bounced off CAMELLIA GAL and MISS LORETTA and checked back at the break, and was always far back. SHINING SILVERSTAR was
outrun throughout.
