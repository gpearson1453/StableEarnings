Footnotes
COBALT BARON stalked two wide outside the early leader, moved to the front just before three-quarters, ran clear in early stretch and was ridden out to the
end. LAW OF THE LAND was shuffled back from between horses nearing the finish line the first time, began a run along the inside after a half, came out
into the three path for room early on the far turn, couldn't gain on the winner and was second best. DULVERTON was caught in tight along the rail around
the first turn,, improved position before a half then faded after six furlongs. AUCHINCRUIVE, reluctant to load, sharply ducked out leaving the gate, lagged

a belated run inside. BRIA AND GIGI was steadied in tight between rivals midway on the backstretch, steadied again behind the leader midway on the turn,
angled in then out entering the stretch and stopped. TIZ TAS TIME was steadied in tight midway on the backstretch, raced the three path around the turn
then stopped. MISS SVENGAIL chased in the three path outside the winner and stopped. COSMOHEART steadied when bearing out into the turn and was
