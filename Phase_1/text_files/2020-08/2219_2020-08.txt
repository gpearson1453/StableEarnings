Footnotes
FLASH ME NOT pressed a short lead through the turn angling out into upper stretch dueling inside of foe hanging on gamely. MS. NINEONESEVEN
chased the pace pressing on the turn, carried out wide in upper stretch dueled abreast foe being denied at the end. CLASSIC ARCH saved ground rallying
in upper stretch bidding gamely late along the rail. TIZ SEEKING A WIN pressed the pace extending on the inside in upper stretch staying on late in the two
path. CHOCOLATE CANDY a step slow through the turn played no factor. LADY PANTHER rushed up to bid four wide on the turn then flattened out in
upper strech. TROPICAL RUNNINGS faded on the turn. MARIE JOELLE was always outrun.
