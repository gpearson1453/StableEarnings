Footnotes
ELREGAL made a wide middle move to the front before half a mile, widened, drifted out in the stretch but lasted. AFLEET MELODY settled close up
outside, went after the winner on the final turn but was outfinished inside that rival. BEST START prompted the pace outside then began faltering on the
final turn. RAILROAD BILL saved ground early, moved wide in the stretch and flattened out. BULLZILLA hustled to the lead inside then stopped after half a
mile. HURACAN dropped back along the inside and was always outrun. BREW DOG lacked speed and weakened steadily. METALLIC TUNE could not
keep up and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
INVITATION ONLY in the three path and just off the pace, waited for racing room near the quarter pole, steadied to avoid heels near mid stretch, changed
course and found and opening between foes and won going away. BIG RAY, very wide throughout, was just up for place. STAY HYDRATED saved ground,
fell back slightly deep stretch but then came back for show. BURN AND TURN, outside, lacked room on the far turn, challenged again in mid stretch and
then was not persevered in the final yards and was outfinished for show. PAT'S GRONK vied for command two wide and weakened slightly in a good effort.
G DADDY, three wide dueling for the lead, drifted in then out brushing winner lightly deep stretch and faded. NAUGHTY FOX failed to menace. ENDUROS
DIAMOND stumbled leaving the gate and was very wide.

PAUL THE WAITER rated wide off the leaders, bid on the final turn then eagerly pulled away in the stretch while kept to his task. LUCK OF THE DRAW

stretch. NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ chased inside early then between rivals and flattened out. ARMAMENT rallied inside before half a mile then had no further
response. AWE MUN dropped back early racing wide and was never a factor. DANCE FOR ORO urged close up three wide to the far turn then gave way.

GELETA saved ground throughout, bid through the final furlong and edged clear late when the pacesetter weakened. DONNYBROOK GIRL quickly took
control, widened in the stretch but shortened stride significantly while drifting out and was nailed late. RAECHEL'S RISK chased wide throughout and
continued willingly to the finish. KIND HUMOR dropped back early then offered some late energy. LAZY MICHELLE stumbled at the start, chased three
wide on the turn and offered a mild bid. TIC TIC TIC BOOM broke a step slowly, raced inside, swung very wide into the stretch. BRAVO REGINA pursued
the loose pacesetter to the stretch then proved empty. RUN LAURA RUN broke sluggishly, raced wide and was never a factor. SPRITE'S LADY chased in
mid-pack then gave way.

DELIGHT stumbled then came out and bumped FINAL PROSPECT, leaving the gate,raced wide and held on well. FINAL PROSPECT was bumped leaving
the gate, raced wide and just off pace then weakened. THE ROBERT raced wide and failed to menace. DIAMOND SETTER, wide, failed to menace.
TERRY'S CHARM saved ground and had only brief speed.

Footnotes
FASTROADAHEAD controlled the fractions, widened on the final turn then remained well clear under a mild drive. NEW YORK ROCK STAR saved ground
while close up, was asked for run near the quarter pole but proved no match for the winner. WOOD BEE pursued the winner outside for three quarters and
faded. LADY LUCY LU broke a step slowly, rushed to contention wide and lacked a rally. KEEPMYEYEONTHEBOYS dropped back early and raced far
beck throughout. PABLO'S DREAM chased outside then along the rail and was never in contention.

Footnotes
EASTPORT didn't break sharply, moved up between foes, angled out through the stretch and was along in time. KADENS COURAGE, between rivals early,
moved inside on the far turn, drifted out while clear in mid stretch and just failed. TOO MUCH JOHNNIE, two wide early, three wide on the turn, drifted out
through stretch and fought tenaciously to wire. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD set the pace in the three path and then faded. SILVERZAR, four wide early, drifted
out near stretch and fell back. JUMP SHOT saved ground and dropped back. PROUDMIAMICITIZEN raced very wide and failed to menace. ANOTHER
SMARTY saved ground and never threatened. RULES prompted the early pace three wide but then was finished leaving the turn. SR.'S THRILL broke
slowly and showed little.
