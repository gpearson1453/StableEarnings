Footnotes
MARYLEE rated a slim early lead inside, was met at even terms leaving the opening turn and came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, dueled
clear approaching the quarter pole then steadily handled to hold on well. KIM'S DIAMOND raced boxed at the rail the first turn then picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole, angled to the five path on the far turn and dug in to take second mid-stretch. BELLA FEMMINA stalked the early pace off the
rail then moved to even terms into the backstretch, challenged toward the three eighths pole, but dropped back approaching the quarter pole and flattened
stride inside the eighth. SPOOKY MOON rated close to the early pace then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn three wide
and weakened. BASKET GIRL settled off the pace and off the rail, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole but was carried to the six path on the far turn
and showed little more. After a late rider change, TIP TOP DIVA raced wide into the first turn, was eased through the backstretch but walked off post race.

Footnotes
DISTORTED SPLENDOR chased the pace and rounded the turn just off the rail, dueled to the front inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear later yards.
ETERNAL HEART came away awkwardly then picked up the chase off the rail, angled to the five path leaving the turn and dug in to take second the final
yards. COLLEGE KID became a bit edgy in the gate then rated the pace toward the inside, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the turn but flattened
stride later yards. THREE BOPS raced off the pace in the three and four paths then angled out from the heels of Carson Castle past the quarter pole, left
the turn in the six path and showed little more. CARSON CASTLE gave chase from the three and four paths then flattened stride leaving the turn.
WINDSOR'S CHAMPION gave chase outside and was forced wide past the quarter pole, angled back to the inside leaving the turn but showed little more.
The stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Three Bops, lodged by the rider of Windsor's Champion, and as a result, disqualified the former to
last place for impeding the progress of the latter past the quarter pole.

Footnotes
START FROM SCRATCH stalked the pace off the rail then challenged into the backstretch, put Frathouse Music away nearing the quarter pole then drew
off under steady handling. CASTLEFINN raced well off the early pace then bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved five wide on the far turn and closed
to take second later yards. SAMADI BLUE rounded the first turn in the three path then bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced four wide on the far turn but
flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE rounded the opening turn in the four path and rated close into the backstretch, picked up
the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced three wide on the far turn then flattened stride. FRATHOUSE MUSIC took over while saving ground into the
first turn and rated the pace, was met at even terms entering the backstretch and dueled from that point, but, dropped back toward the quarter pole and
weakened past the eighth pole. FOURTEEN CARROT raced hemmed in through most of the opening half mile, picked up the chase from the three eighths
pole but weakened near the rail on the far turn. WISPER FREEDOM saved ground off the pace then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
though, faded toward the five sixteenths. ROAD TO DUBAI raced off the pace and off the rail and showed little response through the backstretch.

edge the final yards. INTRACTABLE pressured the pace inside and contested the rail on the turn, took the advantage nearing the head of the lane and held

stretch to duel for third the final strides. UNKISS ME gave chase toward the outside and rounded the turn in the four path then outfinished for third the final
strides. DIMITRI'S ROMANCE gave chase well off the rail and finished evenly. GLORIOUS MYSTERY chased the earlier pace in the four and five paths,

Footnotes
HOMEMADE MOONSHINE broke sharply in to make solid contact with U. S. Millennium then settled off the pace in the four and five paths, bid toward the
seven sixteenths pole and steadily progressed to take the lead two deep nearing the head of the lane, dug in determinedly to fend off Dusky then held on to
best the late arrival of MAN OF CHROME, who settled off the pace and off the rail the opening turn then started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn in the five path, dug in for second in late yards and finished well at the outside girth of the winner. DUSKY stalked the early pace off the
rail and rallied to the lead leaving the three eighths pole, raced clear from the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn near the rail, gave up the lead toward the
head of the lane but continued close to late stretch before reluctantly ceding. U. S. MILLENNIUM was slammed from both sides leaving the gate and settled
off the pace about the four path the opening turn, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path but showed little
more. THISISTHETIMETOWIN angled in to stalk the pace about the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then faded on
the far turn. VILLAGE PRINCE saved some ground while well off the early pace then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
came through the far turn about the six path and passed some rivals. BATTLE ROYALE broke sharply out to make solid contact with U. S. Millennium and
dropped well off the pace, mostly saving ground. SITTIN FROSTY saved early ground. MUSTA NEVER MET U rated the pace inside and came under
pressure while yielding past the three eighths pole, dropped back at the five sixteenths then faded at the rail on the far turn. Per Stewards ruling #51,
Homemade Moonshine has been disqualified from earnings.
