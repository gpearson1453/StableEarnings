Footnotes
IT'S TIMELESS raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, bid three wide on the far turn, led into the stretch and dug in determinedly in the final
furlong to hold off the runner up. INVALUABLE pressed the pace in the two path, then stalked, bid between rivals on the far turn, angled out behind IT'S
TIMELESS entering the stretch, re bid outside of that rival and dug in gamely to the finish. SACRED UNION tracked close up on the inside, chased the
leaders on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and gained mildly for the show spot. ALONG THE WAY set the pace on the inside, dueled inside on
the far turn and weakened. ONETHINGORANOTHER raced three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace and did not factor. ASHIKA was outrun.
GODDESS CAROL chased between rivals and gave way.

TAFFY CANDY was off last, forced to check when in tight on the rail past the five furlong marker, advanced on the turn, made a five wide run passing the
quarter pole, closed willingly outside, ran past the leader under urging, won going away and coasted the final yards. JERSEY JEWEL bobbled at the break
but still showed in front, set the pace racing between rivals early, moved inside on the turn, shook free, dug in late and held on for second. POGI chased
between rivals, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly in the stretch. OHANA EMPIRE chased four wide early, bid two wide on the turn and tired.
AGELESS ARTIST raced in the two path and was steadied at the four and a half furlong marker, then did not factor. BRONX CHERIE chased inside and
faded.

Footnotes
GLAMOROUS THUNDER set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the far turn, responded when roused, dug in gamely between rivals in
the final furlong and held on in a driving finish. MISS BOB raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied outside
and gained late to get the place spot. C'EST MARDI raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far turn and rallied on the rail in the stretch drive.
POSTINO'S IDOL stalked the pacesetter, chased on the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch and closed between rivals in the stretch. PEGGY
O'PRADO raced off the pace, had a ground saving trip and lacked a rally. KISSKISS TELLTELL raced two wide off the pace and failed to respond.
TERPEYE trailed the field, moved up three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. LADY JORDAN broke open the gate prior, settled off the pace and
lugged out badly at the quarter pole, dropping back.
