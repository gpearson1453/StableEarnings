BREED'S HILL Set the pace off the rail, was hooked a furlong out, battled and under pressure held on stubbornly. POLITICAL Unhurried along the two path,
chased into the lane, collared the leader a furlong out, battled and under pressure got the job done. SWEETEST PARTY Broke sluggishly, tracked along the
three path, angled out in the lane and weakened. BLESSED HONOUR Tracked four wide, five wide on the last turn and tired. CHAMPLAIN Broke
sluggishly, four wide after a half mile, took up sharply avoiding the incident at the three-eighths pole and then tired. SUPPORT MISSION Close up early
along the rail, drifted out nearing the three-eighths pole into the path of YOUR TOUCH and then appeared to lose the right iron and pulled up. YOUR
TOUCH Five wide early, dropped down to the two path after a half mile and then was bothered badly by SUPPORT MISSION at the three-eighths pole,
clipped heels with latter and fell. A Stewards inquiry was posted concerning the incident at the three-eighths pole, resulted in no change. Due to a
malfunction of the timer the three-quarter time was hand timed.
