Footnotes
C I M SWEET pulled outside horses to the front, raced clear to the half, was off the rail to the stretch then turned back GAMBLER'S APPEAL in the final
furlong to prevail. GAMBLER'S APPEAL was settled to the half, responded when asked for speed on the second turn, rallied three wide and loomed boldly
to mid stretch but was turned away and settled for the place. SMOKINHOTREDHEAD was outrun to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch and was
making up ground belatedly. CRIMSON CLOUD chased the pace to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late
response. FLORISTA (IRE) had no speed, trailed to the second turn then circled four wide to the stretch but finished evenly late. SKEETER DAVIS was also
chasing to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then weakened. MOSCATO GIRL raced closest to the winner for a half mile then saved ground to
no avail.

Footnotes
STAR OF AFRICA checked away from DIAMETRIC on the first turn, settled to the half, was three wide to the stretch, went after the favorite and closed
strongly to win going away. WITH OPEN EYES set the pace from the rail to the second turn, pushed away to mid stretch but could not stall the winner late.
OVERWHELMING LOVE took up and was forced out to the seven path by HOLY ZAGS on the first turn, settled to the half, raced two wide on the second
turn and was gaining ground late. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU stalked the pace to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch
and weakened. LA GATA ELEGANTE was five wide and avoided the trouble on the first turn, prompted the pace to the half, came three wide to the stretch
but tired in the drive. SURFACE was forced out to the five path by HOLY ZAGS on the first turn, settled to the far turn, raced four wide to the stretch but
weakened in the lane. HOLY ZAGS was rank going into the first turn then took up sharply to avoid DIAMETRIC and bore out, trailed to the far turn and
never had a chance. DIAMETRIC stalked the leader to the first turn then drifted out slightly, clipped heels with WITH OPEN EYES, had the jockey catapult
over the horse's head but expertly managed to maintain a hold, slipped back to the saddle but had lost both irons and was pulled up after a half then walked
off. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident on the first turn but determined that DIAMETRIC caused her own problems and no change was
warranted.

DYNAMITE RIDE was on the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to the stretch, had his rider drop his whip at the three sixteenths pole then
continued on determinedly under strong hand urging. CASH LIMIT was outsprinted to the turn, circled five wide to the stretch and finished in a rally. ASKIN'
FOR TROUBLE stalked the leaders three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. WINE N DIVINE had no speed, was fanned
four wide to the stretch then picked off rivals without threatening. IF I HAD A NICKEL got outrun to the turn, swung out four wide to the stretch then did not
rally. REIGN ON (GB) tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch then weakened. MR. DIPLOMAT had no speed and was not a factor. ZAKAROFF hustled
to duel two wide to the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
BUEN AMIGO never far back to the second turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid stretch and held under steady urging.
GLENROY settled mid pack to the second turn, was fanned four wide while rallying to the stretch and finished willingly for the place. GEM STATE was
outsprinted to the half, saved ground on the second turn then finished in a mild rally. TIZ EMMA was settled for a half mile, got fanned four wide on the
second turn and closed some ground late. FORT YORK attended the pace from the rail for six furlongs, was overtaken by the winner in mid stretch and
weakened late. CURRY NATION had no speed, raced well back to the second turn, was caught four wide to the stretch, eased widest for the drive and was
making up ground belatedly. PEGASUS SPRINT also had no speed, settled for a half mile, was three wide on the second turn but weakened in the drive.
AERIAL DECOY lagged far back to the stretch then finished with a bit of interest. I'M MISTER AMERICA hustled to contest the pace three wide for five
furlongs then tired and stopped in the stretch.
