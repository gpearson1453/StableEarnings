Footnotes
MACHO JACK broke fast and sped clear early, set the pace under some pressure to his outside with the rider poised like a statue in the irons, vied along
the rail on the turn, shook clear outside the quarter-pole then was asked at the top of the stretch, responded well when put to a left-handed whip inside the
three-sixteenths, switched to a right-handed whip while drawing off just inside the furlong marker, widened under the whip until the sixteenth-pole then was
geared down while much the best. CAUSE I SAID SO pressed the pace on the outside, was asked to pick it up in the two path on the turn, lost touch with
the winner coming to the quarter-pole, was put to the whip at the top of the stretch and proved no match while able to safely secure the place. TALESPIN
came out while hustled from the start then had LOVE CODE clip his heels, was urged along towards the rear, departed the backstretch between horses,
went around most of the turn in the two path then dropped to the rail, turned into the stretch under the whip, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and
improved position to get the show. WARFRONT FIGHTER broke a step slow, settled just off the pace, drafted two then three wide on the turn, was roused
while shifting four wide outside the quarter-pole, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. VERIFY was coaxed along while well back on the outside,
went three wide early on the turn, moved to four then five wide late on that bend, turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to threaten. BOSS LIFE
chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and tired. LOVE CODE broke a step slow then
clipped heels and stumbled, recovered to race just off the pace, came under urging leaving the backstretch, chased inside early on the turn, floated three
wide while dropping back late on that bend and had nothing left. UNION CHARM was urged along at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, turned
into the stretch under a drive and showed little.

Footnotes
KEOTA away without apparent mishap, drafted behind the front runners on the backstretch, slid onto the inside route at the top of the turn, got angled four
wide into upper stretch, crept up towards the ones to catch, out-fought a pair of opponents from the eighth pole onward to prove best. OVERHEATED made
it over to the rail coming up to the half mile pole, tracked the pace while pulling on the left, spun into the lane flashing good momentum, sustained it,
launching itself into contention during the ensuing furlong, argued as the innermost of three in the late stages, won the place. BOURBON 'N DITCH was
lightly urged disputing the pace from along the rail, got called upon for the drive, relinquished in midstretch, came out slightly while engaged with at least two
others in the last eighth, weakened into the show slot. JADES GELLY was put to a ride taking up the chase from path two on the turn, commenced the
stretch slightly wider, lacked the needed response. WICKED AMBER failed to menace off a ground-saving trip. GRUDGE sparred for command from path
two, kept up the task in earnest until midstretch, shied out a bit with approximately a sixteenth to go, backed away into last.

under a drive to prevail. OUR AMERICAN STAR three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch,
proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. I SAW IT ALL chased two to three wide, got let out swinging three wide into
upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. NO MORE MIRACLES bobbled at the start, chased along the inside, got roused spinning just off the inside into

Footnotes
GUARDIAN MOON off to an alert beginning remained prominently placed, pressed the issue from the two path, pilot holding the mount in reserve, was
coming up to the three-sixteenths pole when finally turned loose, emerged a sixteenth down the road as the new and undisputed leader, continued onward
with good determination to stay in the clear. HERALD ANGEL brushed with BUSTIN BAY in the shadow of the starting gate, departed the backstretch from
the three path, sat perched within range of the front runners vying for command, settled into the lane and got roused, pursued the winner with willingness
only to prove no match today. CARA'S DREAMER broke approximately a length the slowest, was still the trailer stepping onto the turn, steadily advanced
on the front runners with a sustained three wide run on the turn, fanned out into the five path from upper to midlane, maintained the momentum rallying for
the show. CHASING CARA the widest of several contending for the top during the initial stages,cut over to the rail after having cleared the others, was
lightly hand urged fending off GUARDIAN MOON during the run around the bend, came under a drive spinning into the stretch, proved no match when
challenged by the top one in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, weakened. SHESADIRTYDANCER took the inside route, was sighted having the
pilot apply a snug grip at intervals during the opening phases, was kept on hold waiting options late on the bend, inched her way into the two path prior to
being called upon for more at the three-sixteenths pole, failed to muster up a solid closing punch. NIIJI rode the rail, stepped into the lane then failed to fire
appreciably. LOLLYGAG hustled from the gate, took up position in midpack, travelled four wide on the turn, was about as wide entering the lane, backed
away. GOING GOING GONE two wide entering the turn, was one path farther off the rail exiting it, had no offering. BUSTIN BAY took up the chase from
path two after making light contact with the second place finisher at the start, strolled into the lane appearing to have little left, then while being coaxed, was
allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
LAKE CHICOT coaxed from the gate, had the rider apply a stiff right side rein and took to the path of GESTURE which in turn forced that rival to take to the
inside under coaxing, had the rider sneak a peek back and alter inside placing GESTURE in tight and forcing that foe to steady briefly when obstructed, the
rider looking back once more to the inside before settling finally in hand along the inside showing the way through swift splits uncontested, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside for home, then went clear under a drive to prevail. LA NEGRITA chased just off the inside from just
off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to secure the place honors. GESTURE
hustled from the gate, got taken hold briefly as LAKE CHICOT went on an early obstruction mission being guided out to take the two path, tucked inside
under hustling and was once more hindered as LAKE CHICOT got guided now inside after a peek by her rider and was steadied in tight along the rail with
six and a half furlongs to run, altered back to the two path, the rider of the leader glancing once more for her to no avail before chasing in closest aim of that
rival just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away and weakened.
INTOXICOLOGIST bumped at the start by WICKED TITLE who broke outwards, chased three wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled four wide
into upper stretch and weakened. WICKED TITLE broke out at the start bumping the aforementioned foe, chased along the inside advancing well and with a
surge to be briefly off heels of GESTURE requiring the rider to take hold from the nine-sixteenths to the half mile pole as his charge pulled on the bit, settled
into the turn along the inside, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. BARBARA P chased four
to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. HEARTSTRINGS chased three to four wide under a
ride from midway on the turn, swung four wide for home, tired and was eased through the final furlong. BELLA INVASION coaxed from the gate, chased
three then two wide urged along from the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, folded, and was eased through the final eighth.

Footnotes
HUNGRY KITTEN was unhurried at the rear while racing inside to the two path, had the rider lost his left iron into the final turn, regained the iron in the three
path at the five-sixteenth after the rider reached down to correct it then was roused, swung five wide into the stretch, came under a left-handed whip near
the three-sixteenths, moved out into the final furlong then rallied on the outside, closed strongly into the final sixteenth then switched to a right-handed whip
and got up under impressive handling. ELIADE (FR) was last to commence, raced two to three wide under restraint towards the rear, was roused while
shifting five wide late on the final turn, rallied outside under a left-handed whip while still on her inside lead in upper stretch, took the lead outside the
sixteenth-pole while continuing on her inside lead but was caught while clear for the place. DYNA PASSER was reserved in the two path, came under
urging while four wide on the final turn, rallied to the lead in upper stretch, led under a drive until outside the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear
for the show. PALLAS ATHENE was reserved under a tight hold while three wide, tugged her way closer down the stretch for the first time, continued three
wide while on the outside, was roused on the final turn, chased into the final furlong and weakened. MIGHTY SCARLETT was taken under a tight hold early,
stalked the pace on the outside while racing in the two to three path, was asked with seven-sixteenths to run, chased on the final turn, turned into the stretch
under the whip, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and tired. TASS went to the front, showed the way on an easy lead through glacial
fractions under a snug hold while inside to the two path, was given her cue on the final turn, lost the lead under the whip in upper stretch and gave way.
RED CURLS was reserved on the inside, came under urging on the final turn, moved off the rail around the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under a
drive and failed to rally. TIZAHRA was taken in hand early then reserved on the inside, came under urging while continuing to save ground on the final turn
and failed to respond. (Rail at 18 Feet)

Footnotes
JOLTING JOE away in good order, worked out a tuck into the two path shortly after stepping onto the clubhouse bend, was well rated keeping watch on the
front runners for nearly three-quarters, tipped to the outside in preparation for the drive upon striking the quarter pole, angled three wide and took off in
earnest after the ones to catch, loomed boldly as the outermost of three on near even terms with each other at the beginning of the final furlong, forged to
the front for good a few strides and kicked clear. TURBO DRIVE unhurried in the two path, travelled on the far turn under a hand ride, swung out four wide
into the stretch, clawed its way into contention during the ensuing furlong, failed to sustain the momentum, held late for the place. ZIPALONG was quickly
spotted along the rail after light contact with STUY TOWN BABY at the start, took it until the end of the second bend, fanned out towards path five from
upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, rallied with willingness to garner the show. FRESCO tracked the pace from along the inside route, slipped into
the two path and into traffic turning into the lane, was able to try and launch a rally soon afterwards, failed to fire. DREAM BIGGER bobbled slightly after
lunging at the break, attained a forward position, was rated along prompting the pace, appeared to poke a head down in front as three-quarters was being
completed, got cued up for the drive home, relinquished during the run leading up to and then through the furlong grounds, weakened steadily thereafter.
STUY TOWN BABY grabbed command after brushing with ZIPALONG right after the start, showed the way well held along the rail, attended by DREAM
BIGGER out in the two path, saw the last-mentioned foe take over narrowly as the third fraction was being finalized, stepped into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
KING'S HONOR (IRE) broke out at the start taking over some of the lane of TIKHVIN FLEW who lunged at the start, tracked the pace in closest aim just off
the inside remaining patiently handled until issuing a challenge five-sixteenths from home, swung four wide into upper stretch under urging, took over
command straightened away, dug in under a drive and held safe to prevail. CATORAT broke a half a beat slow, floated out three to four wide into the first
turn before going three wide through that opening bend, raced three to four paths off the rail a bit unsettled in behind cover, went three wide through the far
turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide for home and offered up a mild kick latching on the aforementioned foe as that one hit the
wire. KID CHOCOLATE got checked off the heels of IMPLIED VOLATILITY soon after the start as that rival tucked directly in front, got floated out four wide
into the first turn, settled three wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and kicked
on belatedly to get his nose on the wire for the show honors among a trio. ELUSIVE RULER got floated four wide into the first turn, chased three wide from
just off the pace, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was outfinished in the final jumps.
IMPLIED VOLATILITY coaxed from the gate, pulled early under restraint and tucked to the two path forcing KID CHOCOLATE to be checked in behind,
floated out three wide into the first turn carrying a pair of rivals four and five wide respectively, then settled along the inside into the backstretch in pursuit
from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and was outkicked. REVENIO coaxed from the gate, floated
three wide into the first turn, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
offered no response. TIKHVIN FLEW lunged at the start, got carried out four wide into the first turn as a rival inside got out a bit, settled just off the inside
near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and came up empty. ZELENKA established the front
and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home under challenge to the outside, cornered just off the inside into
upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened. SWORDSMAN got carried out five wide into the first turn outside a pair and then raced
three wide through the remainder of that bend before chasing two to three wide from mid pack, came under a ride with five-sixteenths remaining, went four
wide into upper stretch and tired.
