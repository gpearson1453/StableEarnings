JUST NOD AND SMILE ducked out leaving the gate, gained position outside, raced the four path around the turn, closed outside and was up late. LADY
LYNNE ducked out sharply leaving the gate, was sent to press outside the early leader in the three path, bore out under left hand whip through the lane,
was even with the winner on the front in late stretch but was outfinished. PENSAMIENTO was content to lag, rallied the rail around the turn, angled out
sharply in early stretch and finished fastest outside. ONLY ONE WAY BACK was bumped leaving the gate, moved quickly between horses to gain
command soon after, stayed out from the rail while making the pace into late stretch then faltered. MYHESSEXPRESS ducked into his stablemate leaving
the gate, stayed out from the rail while unhurried early and lacked a closing response. WOLF OF THE NILE wasn't far back along the inside to the stretch
then tired. CANHERUN was no factor.

KELLI'S SMILE came out three wide nearing the stretch then closed a gap from the outside in the final yards. LORD WINSALOT had his head turned to the
inside when the doors opened, broke in the air, lagged inside into the stretch, angled out through midstretch and was up for the show. DREAMING OF
LOVE dueled two wide outside the winner into the stretch then weakened. CLASSY SOLUTION came out into the five path nearing the stretch then
weakened. DONTMESAWITHSISTER settled inside, came out into the four path nearing the stretch then flattened out.

ROSES FROM HEAVEN opened a clear lead from the inside after going a furlong and held after a stiff drive. DON'T MAKE ME BEG wasn't far back in the
three path, vied outside the winner through the lane but wasn't quite enough. WAVERLY SUNSET made a run in the four path on the turn, loomed a threat
outside the top two into the final furlong but weakened. FANCY GAP chased the winner into the turn then stopped. MARY KATE DANAHER hesitated in the
gate, left several lengths behind the field and fell far back early. SONOMA COAST stopped.
