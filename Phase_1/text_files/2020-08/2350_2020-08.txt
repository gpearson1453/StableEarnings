Footnotes
AUTOMATE was forwardly placed along the inside, advanced along the inside into the far turn, tipped out from behind the pair of leaders at the quarter pole,
bid for the lead three wide in upper stretch, forged a narrow advantage under driving pressure at the furlong pole, and held his margin from his inner game
rival through the final stages. WEST SIDER stalked the pace setter two wide while in the three path, inched forward into the far turn to bid for the lead at the
three furlong pole, vied around the far turn with a narrow advantage before meeting AUTOMATE's challenge in upper stretch, was headed by that foe at the
furlong pole, fought on gamely through the late stages, but failed to regain even terms. WILD WEEKEND stalked the pace three wide while in the four path,
but came under a drive into the far turn, failed to keep pace with multiple inner foes around that bend, then kept on mildly through the lane to reclaim a minor
reward. NOT VERY GENTLE saved ground far off of the pace, shifted to the three path to attempt to split horses at the furlong pole, but failed to do so and
made no impact. SUBDUED set the pace under a snug hold along the inside while a path off of the inner rail, met a challenge from WEST SIDER into the
far turn and was headed by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, then weakened in upper stretch. NOD TO PERSIA stumbled at the start and lunged inwards,
then trailed the field throughout and was outrun.

Footnotes
PETION'S PASS quickly cleared, widened her advantage around the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, and held HITCHED'S late rally at bay under
confident handling despite tiring on her left lead. HITCHED chased the loose leader from the three path, sustained a rally after forging place between rivals
in upper stretch, and was gaining on the leader late. GIRLYS GIFT saved ground far off of the pace, cut the corner turning for home and produced a place
bid, but was outfinished by an outer foe for that position. SEMINOLE SISTERS was off slowly and brushed the gate, trailed outside of foes early on, rallied
in the five path around the turn to produce a bid for place turning for home, but flattened out and weakened in upper stretch. GIGABYTE tracked from
midpack in the four path, and was done early. PISANTE' CAT chased the pace setter two wide, but weakened between horses turning for home, and
subsequently stopped.

INDIAN FEATHER vied along the inside early on before taking back to stalk the trio of leaders into the backstretch, shifted outside of those foes, rebid for
the lead four wide around the far turn, forged an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, and held her advantage under a long drive. STAGE FIVE
CREEPER vied for the lead three to two wide between horses while in the three path around both turns, fought on gamely between horses after INDIAN
FEATHER edged a narrow advantage in upper stretch, but did not have enough to regain even terms. CARINA set the pace in the two path and between
horses early on, cleared an inner foe and held an advantage inside a pair of rivals down the backstretch, stayed in the two path around the far turn, but was
headed when inside of a trio of foes turning for home, then kept on and continued to vie through the lane, but failed to regain even terms. LADY
CLEOPATRA vied for the lead four to three wide while in the four path around both turns, but weakened between horses turning for home. GREEDY
AMERICAN was outrun. Due to a timer malfunctions, all internal fractions were omitted, and the final time was hand timed

Footnotes
EXPRESS LADY prompted the pace three wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, brushed with the game inner leader in upper stretch, dueled
courageously through the lane, and prevailed in the final sixteenth. STRONG ILLUSION set the pace two wide and between horses early on, came under a
drive to hold an advantage inside of EXPRESS LADY at the five sixteenths pole, brushed with that foe in upper stretch and dueled gamely through the lane,
but was bested inside the final sixteenth. VALSHEBA vied inside of a pair of foes while under urging down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with
those rivals at the three furlong pole, then held show through the lane. BERTIE THE BEAUTY tracked from midpack two wide in the three path, and
produced a mild grind through the lane without threatening. DE LA CHA CHING trailed the field around the turn, and passed tired rivals without factoring.
QUEEN CHARMAINE saved ground off of the pace and failed to factor. PROPER SHE IS was forwardly placed behind the trio of leaders in the two path,
but weakened into the turn. WINDY'S SPIRIT was outrun along the inside. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE OPENING QUARTER TIME WAS
OMITTED.

Footnotes
BLISSFUL CHANGE pressed the pace setter two wide, took over for that foe approaching the three furlong pole, repelled PHAROAH'S GOLD's bid turning
or home, and drew off through the lane. PHAROAH'S GOLD tracked along the inside around the first turn, shifted three wide into the backstretch to avoid
rivals as the leader backed down the pace, stalked three wide before making a bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole outside of BLISSFUL CHANGE,
but was repelled by that foe turning for home, flattened out while hanging on her left lead, but held place. OVERDRESSED stalked along the inside, but
failed to keep pace with the leader turning for home, and lacked a rally to produce a place bid through through the lane. SILVER MAPLE stumbled badly at
the start and lost all chance, trailed the field early on, rallied along the rail through the far turn, then stayed on mildly through the lane. MARIAH'S GIRL
tracked from midpack four wide around the first turn before being forced five wide into the backstretch, but weakened turning for home. PINCH MINE raced
far off of the pace along the inside, and failed to factor. SLEWPY'S HALO cleared into the first turn, backed down the pace into the backstretch, held an
advantage to the seven sixteenths pole, but weakened into the far turn, and stopped through the lane. SHOWSTOMPER tracked from midpack three to four
wide into the backstretch, but was done early, and showed little.

Footnotes
CHULETA set the pace while staying a path of of the rail, held her margin in upper stretch from an inner bidding foe, drifted out, then inched away passing
the furlong pole. OLIVE U raced close to the pace along the inside, produced a rail bid for the lead in upper stretch, but failed to match strides with the
leader passing the furlong pole, and proved second best. TWO CARROT RANSOM saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the three path while gaining
approaching the furlong pole, and edged show passing the sixteenth pole. DANCE HALL DOLL advanced four wide while in the five path around the turn to
bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch, leveled off, then got outfinished by an inner foe for show.
CATLIKE stalked two wide early on, inched forward three wide while in the four path and between horses around the turn to bid for the lead at the quarter
pole, but flattened out in upper stretch. LADY SPIDUTES had a slow start, trailed along the inside, and was no factor. TOO CROWDED was not a factor.
MY AGAPE prompted the pace two wide while in the three path, but weakened between horses turning for home, stopped, was eased in the final furlong,
pulled up approaching the wire, bled, and was vanned off.

weakened turning for home, but miraculously refound stride passing the furlong pole, and regained place in the final stages. BAKER'S MAN raced far off of
the pace along the inside around the first turn, then two wide around the far turn before swinging to the five path turning for home, and offered a mild kick for
a minor reward. HAWK OF WAR saved ground in midpack before inching forward between horses into the far turn, then stayed on between horses through
the late stages under light urging. IADANZA stalked in the three path, bid for the lead into the far turn, but was repelled in upper stretch, and weakened
through the final furlong. KID SHELLEEN stalked along the inside, but weakened into the far turn. ON THE MUSCLE tracked from midpack in the four path,
came into the lane in striking range, but weakened. PRINCE OF WAR broke inwards, bumped a foe, and was off slowly, then trailed early on, and never
played a factor. CLASSIC SKY was squeezed at the start, raced far off of the pace three wide, and never got involved. HIGHLINE BRIDGE stumbled at the
start, and showed little. Due to a timer malfunction, the six furlong time was omitted

BETSDOWNLETSRIDE bumped with an inner foe at the start, dueled for the lead inside of LONESOME SOUND, was headed by that foe passing the
quarter pole, but dug in gamely in upper stretch and regained the lead at the furlong pole, then held the advantage to the wire. LONESOME SOUND was
bumped by an outer foe at the start, dueled for the lead outside of BETSDOWNLETSRIDE, forged a narrow advantage turning for home, but failed to kick
away from his inner game foe in upper stretch, relinquished the lead back to that foe at the furlong pole, and was denied the victory. CLEAR STEPS stalked
the leading duelers three wide, but lacked a kick to make a bid, and chased those foes through the lane. LOOKIN AT JUSTICE bumped with an outer foe at
the start, trailed along the inside, saved ground around the turn, and produced a mild rail rally while hanging on his left lead, but failed to threaten. CHICKS
FOR FREE bobbled a bit at the start and was off slowly, rallied in the four path around the turn, but flattened out in upper stretch, and weakened. JAMIN'S
JET broke inwards and bumped a foe at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside, but weakened and was done early.

Footnotes
TRAFFIC STOP was bumped on both side at the start, raced far off of the pace two wide, rallied four wide in the five path around the far turn to produce a
bid for the lead turning for home, and drew off passing the furlong pole. GET ALONG set the pace along the inside while staying about a path off of the inner
rail, built a clear lead into the far turn, but met a challenge from TRAFFIC STOP turning for home, proved no match for that foe passing the furlong pole, and
was second best. DARKNSTORMYTIME tracked from midpack in the four path around the first turn, inched forward to stalking position at the five furlong
pole, but was outmoved by a wider foe turning for home, then stayed on through the lane to just achieve show at the wire. HIGLEY O'PRADO stalked along
the inside, but lacked a kick to make a bid, chased the leaders through the lane, then was nailed for show at the wire. SUGAR DOG FOX saved ground far
off of the pace around the first turn, took the far turn in the three to four path before swinging to the six path turning for home, but only produced a mild kick
and failed to threaten. HURRICANE JAKE prompted the pace two wide while in the three path, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart into the far
turn, then weakened between horses turning for home. TAPNGO tracked from midpack in the two path, but weakened and failed to factor. ROUL THE ICE
trailed throughout and was never involved.
