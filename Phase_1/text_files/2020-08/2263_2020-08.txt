Footnotes
IMPOSING CAT sat just off the pace outside, pressed the issue at the three eighths pole, was headed into the stretch then drifted inward under
encouragement and just held under a long drive. METRO DREAMER allowed to settle early, circled in the final turn moving up menacingly outside of
IMPOSING CAT, rallied in the stretch but was unable to get by. THISISMYSTORY hustled from the two path, chased four wide into the lane, was closing
ground late and finished best of the others. PHIL POWER attended the early pace five wide, shuffled back into the first turn and finished evenly. OIL
CHANGE lacked early speed, chased inside and failed to threaten. SCREAMIN SUE broke awkwardly and failed to recover. TROJAN pressed four wide,
was unable to move on with rivals into the lane and retired early. WYATT set a pressured pace from just off the rail, was unable to keep pace with the field
and tired.

Footnotes
LANNY MAC sat just off the pace from the four path, challenge the lead at the top of the lane and drew away through the stretch to an easy victory.
PROVOCATIVE PRINCE hurried away then settled between rivals through the backstretch, swung out and was along for place. ROYAL STATUS broke
alertly to dictate the pace, was challenged by LANNY MAC but was no match into the stretch and held on for show. TANNIN shifted outside in the
backstretch, chased at the quarter pole inside and offered a mild rally late. POCKET DIAL saved ground inside, was asked to quicken leaving the final turn
and came up empty for the drive. HEAD HONCHO trailed the field and chased throughout. NEWSBOY raced wide entering the backstretch and was done
early. SWANKY FRANKIE never reached contention.

Footnotes
MISS MCFAD unhurried early outside, angled in leaving the backstretch, shifted out at the quarter pole, angled in between rivals at the top of the stretch
and won driving. SNEAKY SISTER sat just off the pace from the five path, moved up alongside the leader at the three eighths marker, gained the lead
entering the stretch but was out kicked by the winner. TACTICAL EDGE tracked outside, raced wide leaving the final turn and rallied mildly for show.
CRAFTY ENGAGEMENT away slow, settled inside, swung out into the lane and showed some interest late. SPIN A TALE tracked from the two path,
dropped back through the final turn and flattened out under encouragement. MOE'SANNIE sat mid pack outside and lacked the rally required.
CARRAMIAMINE contested the early pace inside, was overtaken at the entering the stretch and faltered inside. SALSA TANGO set a pressed pace while
pressured by CARRAMIAMINE, was unable to move on with rivals and faded through stretch. LITTLE ROSALYN broke in the air, was distanced by the field.
**STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving LITTLE ROSALYN but made no change as LITTLE
ROSALYN was deemed to have had a fair start.

MASK chased from the four path and rallied mildly into stretch. POOR RUBEN was bumped at the five eighths pole, angled in entering the far turn then
rallied mildly under urging. IMTELLINGYOUMYSON tracked inside and had no response when called upon into the stretch. JOHNNY RUNNER last away,

Footnotes
RAIDER sat in striking position outside, was asked to quicken in the final turn, swept the lead into the lane and won driving. PORT PROTECTION stalked
the pacesetters inside, shifted out into the lane then began to improve position into the stretch, kept on earnestly but was no match for the leader.
SAVEITFORARAINYDAY tracked inside, raced in traffic entering the stretch, shifted out and closed outside. A RING 'N A ROSE vied inside for the early
lead, dueled inside of BLUES ROAR, was under steady urging into the stretch and weakened late. BLUES ROAR contended the early pace racing two to
three wide, engaged in a dueled outside of A RING 'N A ROSE into the far turn and lacked the rally needed in the drive. BROADWAY BONNIE never far
back outside, moved up menacingly into the lane and yielded. EMMA JEAN TOO trailed throughout.

Footnotes
EVER TRUE vied inside for the early lead, inherited the lead at the five sixteenth pole, widened entering the stretch and was ridden out. DARE TO GO
bumped leaving, raced near the back of the pack, took closer order into the final turn, circled into the lane, was gaining outside late but was no match for the
winner and finished clearly second best. SOCRATES reserved off the pacesetters inside, dropped back through the turn and rallied mildly through stretch.
COZY CAPER broke out, contended the early pace, was unable to sustain the bid that was needed and kept on evenly through the stretch under light
handling. FORMAL TUX jostled away, advanced along the rail lacked a serious bid. LUCKY LAST NIGHT sandwiched leaving, chased inside into the lane
and had nothing left in reserved for the drive. OSO BRAVE unhurried early, swung out in the final turn then was steadied in traffic at the top of the lane and
gave way. IMPERIAL SUN broke inward and showed little. EASTER HALO bumped leaving, chased wide in the backstretch, was brushed into the stretch
and yielded. DOUBLE RANSOME allowed to settle off the pacesetters, raced four wide leaving the backstretch, drifted out approaching the stretch and gave
way. DIAVAL broke out into rivals and trailed.
