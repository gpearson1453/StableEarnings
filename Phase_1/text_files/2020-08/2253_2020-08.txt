Footnotes
TUITION PLAN chased the pace from the three path and took the lead leaving the turn, dueled clear mid-stretch then widened under steady
encouragement. MOJO MATTERS settled off the pace inside then bid at the rail leaving the turn, eased outward in the upper stretch then dueled to the
finish to earn the nod for second. ANI WINEHOUSE chased the pace outside and rounded the turn in the five path then missed the nod for second in a long
stretch duel. HEDGE BURNER chased the earlier pace inside, angled four wide leaving the turn but was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. KOOL KEA
pressured the pace off the rail and took the lead past the five sixteenths pole, was caught leaving the turn, dropped back mid-stretch then flattened later
yards. DEVELIN' ROSE was hustled along to set a pressured pace, gave up the lead leaving the five sixteenths pole then weakened into the lane.
COPELANQUIKZIP was initially a starter in this race, however, at the last minute she lodged her head behind the stall gate upright bar and was declared a
non-starter by the stewards, after they conducted an inquiry.

CHARITABLE SPENNY rated a short lead inside then came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, widened the advantage on the far turn and held
well under steady handling. ROCKET ROAD rated off the pace after loading reluctantly, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn
about the three path, dueled for second at the eighth pole and finished well to gain slightly on the winner. PRINCE OF WINDSOR settled off the pace toward
the inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail then dueled through the stretch for third. STEP OUT DANCING raced well
back inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. SUNBRIDLED stalked the pace from the three path and
challenged leaving the three eighths pole, but, dropped back into the far turn and flattened stride. BACOLI raced off the pace about the three path and
showed little response through the backstretch. SILVER CASTLE raced in the four path the opening turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole
then weakened in the three path of the far turn. This race was hand timed.

BRILLIANT IDEAS settled off the early pace toward the inside then bid into the turn, angled to the outside leaving the turn and dug in to get up at the wire.
INDIAN WILDFIRE raced with the early pace and rounded the turn about the four path, dueled to the front mid-stretch but was caught at the wire. MODERN
COWPOKE chased the pace and rounded the turn about the five path then finished evenly. MR. SNAP chased the pace from the inside and raced evenly
down the lane. THE BIG STORM raced with the pace and took the lead nearing the quarter pole, drew clear midway on the turn but was caught mid-stretch
and flattened stride the final sixteenth. STERLING GLADIATOR chased the pace toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn and finished evenly. SHOW
TALENT was outrun while mostly wide. GOTTA NIP saved ground. WINDSOR'S FUN hustled to the lead three wide and between horses, was caught
approaching the quarter pole then weakened toward the rail. GRECIAN ADMIRAL dwelt at the break.

Footnotes
TAMAQUA stalked the earlier pace toward the inside, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and took aim three wide approaching the top of the lane,
dueled to the lead mid-stretch and drew clear later yards. CHESTNUT LIME angled to the inside to rate a short lead, came under pressure toward the three
eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail rounding the far turn, but was caught mid-stretch and relented later yards. CANDY MAN ONE stalked
the pace from the three path then challenged toward the three eighths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage two deep rounding the far turn and raced evenly
down the lane. FEAR THE LATI settled off the pace in the three and four paths, bid approaching the quarter pole and rounded the turn at the rail, angled
four wide toward the head of the lane but flattened stride. RAVIN' MAVEN saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far
turn in the four and five paths but proved empty down the lane. BRO LATTE stalked the pace from the two and three paths then picked up the chase leaving
the three eighths pole, though, faded on the far turn. MASTER YOO saved ground and showed little response. MINI BOLT was sluggish into stride and
never factored. This race was hand timed.
