Footnotes
AMEERAH B away in good order, narrowly set the pace inside, put away the other speed entering the stretch, kicked clear and was not asked her best the
final sixteenth to win ridden out. SIENNA BREEZE dueled outside the winner for a half in the two path, could not keep pace in the drive while drifting out a
bit past the furlong marker, clearly second best. NANCY'S RESCUE settled off the pace and the inside, came four wide out of the turn, along for the show
while not a threat to the top pair. MISS UNDERRATED lacked speed toward the inside, was saving ground late in the turn when in some traffic, continued
along the rail for the drive and finished up evenly. KEEP AMERICA GREAT closest to the dueling leaders four five furlongs, had little left late to lose the
show. EZEE ENOUGH broke back, five wide into the lane, lacked a serious closing response. MARAMA last to leave, failed to menace. RACIN PRAYER
broke sharp, fell back into the second flight, backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
ICE PEAK with the pace from the start, vied between rivals up the backstretch and through the turn, long drive, dug in late to prevail in game fashion. JAIL
HOUSE back off the pace, two path through the turn, steered out a bit when set down upper stretch, slowly getting to the winner late while between horses
at the wire. GOFORTHEWINECOURSE in mid pack while outside the runner up, four wide through the turn, slowly grinding late with that same rival to be
closing the gap on the winner. LEO DEL REO dueled up front closest to the inside, gave ground grudgingly the final furlong. WESTERN DAYS forwardly
placed while racing three wide, lacked a closing punch in the stretch. SHAQ JACK broke back, lacked speed, saved some ground, moved out a bit for the
drive, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat. JENNOVODKA failed to menace while racing outside. REDDING COTEAU in the second
flight early, began a steady fade before a half. TONIGHTS STAR last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
RESILIENT RICK tucked inside soon after the start, saved ground through the first turn, continued to race inside through the second bend, switched out
when straightened for home, engaged the leader inside the furlong grounds and wore that rival down to be up in time. CAJUN CASH dueled early closest to
the inside, fell back off the other speed, rebid turning for home, briefly clear, could not contain the winner, lasted for the place. KILLEEN settled off the pace
and the inside, four out to five wide turning for home, managed a slow gain late while lacking a winning punch in the waning strides. BIG CANE dueled early
in the two path, clear onto the backstretch, opened up a large lead by the half mild mark, weakened when headed entering the stretch. STAR BANJO void of
speed for a half, improved a bit by the third quarter, not dangerous in the drive. PURIM KING last to leave, failed to menace. BUCK DUANE chased the
early speed and had little left for the drive. OVER FUNDED was finished after a half.

Footnotes
SLINGSHOTSLEW broke on top despite bobbling slightly, vied into the turn in the two path, clear into the lane, drew out steadily through the stretch while
being kept to task. RACELYNN in the second flight while racing off the inside, came three wide into the lane, rallied to be clear for the place, no match for
the winner. QUICK HEAT vied early while between rivals and outside the winner, chased that one into and through upper stretch, could not contain the
runner up late, remained clear of the others. MY HEART DOMINUS with the pace four wide early, continued four wide late in the turn, weakened in the
drive. ANNIE'S LUCK bothered and steadied at the start, raced back early, altered course to be five wide into the lane, improved slightly. CLOSINGBELLE
bothered soon after the start and was floated out, continued outside and raced five wide through the turn, angled in steadily through the stretch to improve a
bit, never dangerous. BRIGHTNMORNINGSTAR void of speed, made little impact. HAIRTRIGGER HEART fractious while loading, broke mid pack, moved
up along the rail to briefly contest the pace, shuffled back into the turn, continued to faded. BERNICE D'WILDCAT broke out, mid pack for three furlongs,
gave way in the drive. DIVINE POWER came out early to bother CLOSINGBELLE, was pulled up abruptly early in the turn in apparent distress, vanned off.

Footnotes
FANCY MALLORY with the pace from the start, vied out of the chute closest to the inside, narrowly showed the way into and through the turn, shook clear
when straightened for home, enough left to hold off the runner up. HERO OF GOLD forwardly placed off the inside, three wide turning for home when
moving a bit closer, chased the winner past the furlong marker then was slowly getting to that rival late. RHETT'S RACER bothered slightly at the start,
lacked speed outside, raced four wide through the turn, mounted a minor rally in the drive to be along for the show, no threat to the top pair. THAT'S A
SONG forwardly placed, crept closer three wide to briefly challenge turning for home, hung in the drive. CAUGHT HIS EYE went one paced throughout in
lacking a closing response. MARQUEE MOMENT also turned in an even effort in coming up empty for the drive. ROSECOLOREDGLASSES broke back
and failed to menace. JOLIE GEE lacked speed, five wide out of the turn, not a threat. MY MALLORY'S ON took up at the start, trailed most of the way in
remaining back and six wide into the lane. LUCKY TAYLOR vied up front outside the winner and between horses, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
MIRABEAU away in good order, prompted the pace off the inside, took over in the two path turning for home, drew strongly clear while being kept to
pressure. SQUOX broke back, lacked early foot, moved out and came six wide into the stretch, rallied down the middle of the track to be up late for the
place, no threat to the winner. MAMAS GONE CRAZY broke well then cleared to the inside, showed the way into and through the turn, offered little
resistance to the winner when confronted by that rival entering the stretch, chased that same foe until late when nipped for the place. TECATE TIME lacked
early foot outside, was five wide into the turn, three wide exiting, steadied slightly while angling back out, improved position, not enough late for the show.
TOTALLY GRACE raced within striking distance for three furlongs toward the inside, came up empty for the drive. MISS NITAP lacked speed inside,
continued to save ground into the lane, improved slightly with some mild late interest. CHEME pressured the issue for three furlongs outside the winner, had
little for the drive. WINNING ROMANCE bobbled at the start, remained back in lacking a bid. SENORITA TSUNAMI four out to five wide in the turn when
well off the pace, failed to muster a kick in the drive. MY KIKI void of speed, moved out for the drive, also lacked a closing response. TWIN SISTERS last to
leave, moved up to mid pack turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
BIG BELLA BROWN forwardly placed while racing outside, moved up to duel through the turn and into the stretch, long drive, determined late to prove best.
YES HE CAN showed the way early, dueled through the turn inside the winner, remained on equal terms with that one past the furlong marker, proved
stubborn until the end. COPPER FIDDLE lacked speed, saved ground turn and improved inside of several rivals into the stretch, proved no match for the top
two, edging clear of the others. SIR TRUEBADOUR went one paced throughout off the inside in lacking a closing punch. TIGERBEACH void of speed,
swung five wide into the lane, lacked a significant rally. PURE VALOR off a step slow, moved outside, also came five wide turning into the stretch, remained
back. PREEMPTIVE pressed the issue early, began a steady retreat before three furlongs. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL TIME UNAVAILABLE
DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
CHU CHU'S LEGACY broke sharp, dueled up front up the backstretch and into the turn, came out a bit to float JANETS JAY JAY out turning for home, set
down, drove steadily clear. SCHNELL broke back, lacked speed, moved outside midway on the when being asked along, came five wide into the stretch,
rallied willingly to be in time for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. G'WILDCAT in mid pack early while off the inside, four wide exiting the turn,
rallied inside the runner up, outkicked for that one for the place while between rivals at the wire. JANETS JAY JAY broke out and steadied, was straightened
to advance into a forward position into the turn, ranged up three wide to briefly challenge late in the turn outside the winner, was floated out four wide into
the lane, drifted in, could not keep up, weakened late, caught for the place. JIMMY TWO TIMES forwardly placed out in the strip, three wide and in some
traffic late in the turn, came up empty for the drive. CATINANDSCATIN back off the pace, moved slightly closer in the turn off the inside then went evenly
through the stretch. FOOLISH DREAMS went one paced throughout in lacking a closing resposne. BERNIE SPECIAL dueled up front along the inside, gave
way in the drive. ADIEU LE CHAT remained back throughout. DEPUTY JEB last away, was also never involved while four wide through the turn.

ELLIE D CAJUN in the second flight while toward the inside early, remained behind the lead pack through the turn, asked along and angled out four wide
entering the stretch, closed with good resolve to be up in time. TOGAROCK vied up front three wide, shook clear late in the turn, maintained daylight past
the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, remained clear for the place. MY GIRL EM broke in to bother G G'S WRECKINGBALL, was straightened,
lacked early foot, came three wide and between rivals into the stretch, finished willingly to be closing the gap late, well clear of the others. ARCTIC GUITAR
lacked speed, saved some ground through the turn, shifted out a bit for the drive, improved position without threatening the top three. SOUTHERN GALAXY
forwardly placed while racing off the inside, came up empty when asked for the drive. CLOCKED IN TYME broke a bit slow, raced back early, moved out
and was fanned six wide into the lane, improved position down the middle of the strip. CHEROKEE WILDCAT in the second flight outside the winner, was
floated out by that one to be five wide into the lane, lacked a closing response. K ONE COMET lacked speed, five wide out of the turn, failed to muster a
rally. G G'S WRECKINGBALL bothered at the start, remained back. DOUBLE APPEAL vied early closest to the inside, gave way. SEISMIC vied up front
