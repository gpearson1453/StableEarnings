Footnotes
THEYREMINISCEOVERU stalked the leaders to the turn, rallied three wide to get to terms into the stretch, took the lead in mid stretch and held under
steady urging. SOUL PRODIGY attended the pace from the rail to the stretch, could not stall the winner in mid stretch but dug in to save second.
TAMARANDO'S MINE was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. QUE SERA SIR RALPH had no
speed, saved ground on the turn and also closed some late. MR. ARTISTIC was bumped by both SWEET BAGS and AUTISM SAVANT at the start and
was green to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch but was still acting inexperienced while making a mild run late. AUTISM SAVANT hustled to
contest the pace off the rail to the stretch then got outrun to mid stretch and tired. SWEET BAGS had brief speed only.

AMBER LOUISE chased the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms with ANA LISA in mid stretch but could not shake
that one then prevailed with determination. ANA LISA attended the pace outside of REAL KEEPER, was three wide to the stretch, met the winner's bid in
mid stretch, stayed on stubbornly to deep stretch then was an easy second. JUPITER S. had no speed, saved ground to the stretch but could not threaten
the top two. REAL KEEPER flashed good speed, dueled off the rail to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. HAMMY TIME chased
the leaders to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response. FRUITFULLY had no speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GABO'S MACONDO prompted the pace to the second turn, rallied two wide to the stretch, got to terms nearing mid stretch then dug in late to edge away.
PASSIONATE REWARD set the pace under pressure from the winner to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then was collared but stubbornly held
second. MORE POWER TO HIM was settled to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then could not impact the winner and was too late for second.
MANILA MISCHIEF settled outside of MORE POWER TO HIM to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then lacked the needed late response.
ENGRAM had no speed and was not a factor.

READY FOR A FIGHT stalked the pace to the turn, was two wide to the stretch, got bumped in the rear by KINCAID PARK but responded in the drive and
finished willingly to get the nod. OUR BOLD PRINCE chased the pace to the turn, had to circle five wide to the stretch then closed steadily and just missed.
CIRCUS ACT dueled for the lead from the rail to the stretch, responded when roused, battled on late and just missed while deadheating for second.
ELECTORAL had no speed, was off the rail on the turn then was attempting to rally but was caught behind CIRCUS ACT, had to wait in mid stretch and
finished willingly once clear. WINE AND WHISKY got outsprinted to the turn, was three wide to the stretch then was also caught in traffic outside at the three
sixteenths, waited then finished steadily in the late going. ECOLOGIST had no speed, was fanned four wide to the stretch but did not threaten in the drive.
CARTELLATE chased the pace early, was three then four wide to the stretch, got bumped by KINCAID PARK in upper stretch and weakened in the late
stages. KINCAID PARK attended the pace two wide, was tiring leaving the quarter pole then bumped CARTELLATE and shifted in to bump READY FOR A

ODESSA pressed the pace to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch, rallied to get to terms in mid stretch and edged away driving. LUCKY STEPPER
chased the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then finished willingly for the place. TOTALLY NORMAL was also chasing for a half mile,
raced three wide to the stretch but was outfinished in the late stages. EARLYNTHEMORN hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch,
resisted to mid stretch then tired. BIG MARIA saved ground throughout but lacked a closing response. AMERICAN ROYALTY had no speed, also was
saving ground to the stretch then came up empty. SAPORI GIRL setlted mid pack to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then weakened and was
not persevered with late. PROUD TO SHOYU had no speed and was not a factor. SHAKE IT CALI was always outrun.

winner. CANNONBALL COMIN was bumped by BOLD ROMAN to begin, got outsprinted to the turn, circled five wide to the stretch and closed steadily late.
BOLD ROMAN broke out, bumped CANNONBALL COMIN at the start and took a few strides to regain his balance, had no speed, was four wide to the
stretch then shifted out and came on late in a good effort. SHARON'S FURY attended the pace outside of RUN HEAT, was forced out to the four path on
the turn when that one lugged out, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. DRINK TIL YOU DROP had no speed, swung out to the five path into the
stretch and finished in a mild rally. NEPTUNE'S SPEAR was also chasing the pace, raced three wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. STONE

on the turn and gave way in the drive.
