Footnotes
PASAMONTE MAN was allowed to settle early, made a middle move into the home turn between rivals, took the lead, met the bid of HOLY FRAZIER,
shook that rival and edged clear. HOLY FRAZIER was void of any speed, advanced six wide into the second turn, made a bid on the winner, couldn't
sustain and finished second best. EYE OF THE HUNTER was unhurried early, advanced along the inside into the home turn and was along for third.
BRICKHOUSE set a pressured pace four wide into the second turn and weakened. TAMAIT (FR) was outrun early, circled seven wide into the second turn
and offered no late rally. FORGOTABOUTME pressed the early pace and faded.

Footnotes
YOU LIGHT ME UP tracked the early pace, went six wide into the turn, took control in late stretch and edged clear. YOU BUG ME was allowed to settle
early, raced between rivals into the turn, was no match and finished second best. ROCKY PROSPECT set a pressured pace, went four wide into the turn
and weakened. I'VECOMETOWORSHIP was unhurried early, advanced seven wide and finished belatedly. HE'S A HIT pressed the early pace from off the
rail and tired. PACK TWELVE raced in mid pack, went three wide and tired. DOM WAYNE was outrun early, circled eight wide and never fired. CALEB'S
STORM was never a threat. PIRATE MISCHIEF was never a factor.
