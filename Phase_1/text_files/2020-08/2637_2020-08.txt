Footnotes
FRENCH LIGHT (FR) jumped well towards the rear of the field, went three wide on the final turn, was roused while rallying five wide into the stretch,
accelerated quickly to the front then kicked clear outside the eighth-pole and was completely geared down in the final furlong while much the best. A
SILENT PLAYER (IRE) was reserved near the back on the inside, jumped hesitantly in some traffic over fence seven, hit the top of fence eight, saved
ground through the final turn, found room along the cones in upper stretch then slipped through to make a brief bid and proved no match for his stablemate
while able to get the place. GAYE BREEZE (IRE) jumped well in the middle of the field, was asked on the final turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive
and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. CRITICAL DATA (IRE) was rated in third position on the outside, stumbled landing over fence nine,
was asked near the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response then was vannned off after the race. BRIANBAKESCOOKIES stalked the pace on the
outside, jumped inward over fence three wide, was near the heels of the leader upon landing but maintained stride, drew even around the eighth fence, was
asked on the final turn, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened. TOMGARROW (IRE) set the pace in hand while jumping well, vied inside through
the final turn, was asked for his best into upper stretch and tired. PRAYER HOPE lunged multiple times under restraint for the opening three-sixteenths,
climbed behind horses at the rear through the first turn, was reserved under restraint at the back, jumped awkwardly over fence eight, was roused while
moving out four wide on the final turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BANKERS DAUGHTER prompted the pacesetter from the two path, drew closer to that opponent as the half was being completed, responded when given
her cue in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole to take charge, held late to prevail. IMPAZIBLE DONNA pursued the pace from path three on the turn, was
put to a drive at the five-sixteenths pole, went into the lane, rallied for the place. SNICKET sat reserved two wide for the opening half, fanned out towards
path four from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, mustered up a mild response to claim the show award. BELLA DOMENICA gradually
maneuvered into the pocket on the backstretch, felt the whip by the five-sixteenths marker, moved out into path two at the top of the lane, came up empty.
MUNNINGS MUSE cemented herself to the front end with an abbreviated brisk hand ride, showed the way, with the winner in accompaniment out in path
two, succumbed when put to the test by that opponent a few strides beyond the quarter pole, steadily backed away.

CAP DE CREUS tracked the pace just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
rallying to stack between foes a furlong out, took command a sixteenth from home, knocked heads gamely to the wire to get the nod on the line. SETTING
THE MOOD brushed the off side stall at the start, ranged up shortly after the break to take over command and settled showing the way just off the inside
under rating, tucked inside seven furlongs from home, got flashed the stick to the off side down the backstretch intermittently, came under urging at the
five-sixteenths under challenge, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive clinging to the front under challenge from the field a furlong
out, got collared a sixteenth from home and fought on to the finish but lost the bob at the end. WHATDOESASHARKSAY saved ground at the tail of the field
through the first two turns before tipping out two wide with six furlongs to go and then three wide at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing past the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. QUIET DIGNITY tracked the pace just off the inside in closest aim of the leader,
came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and was heads apart for command swinging three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between foes
from the three-sixteenths to the sixteenth marker, then weakened in the late stages. COILEAN BAWN led early on before being displaced from command by
SETTING THE MOOD midway on the first turn, tracked that rival along the inside patiently handled until placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung
two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going.

Footnotes
DASH TO THE TOP bobbled ever so lightly at the start then bumped lightly with a rival while hustled, established a good position while traveling comfortably
down the backstretch, drafted inside on the turn, was asked while cutting the corner into the stretch, slipped through inside a foe to make a bid inside two
rivals at the three-sixteenths then took the advantage after being put to a left-handed whip, switched to a right-handed whip while inching clear into the final
furlong and drew off under strong urging. BOLD ARTICLE bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along on the outside, chased four wide on the turn,
was asked for more at the five-sixteenths, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch under a right-handed whip, switched to a left-handed
whip outside the eighth-pole, lost touch with the winner into the final furlong, swapped back to a right-handed whip at the sixteenth-pole and safely secured
the place while no match for the winner. KATIES COURAGE was fractious in the gate, bumped lightly with a foe at the start, set the pace under some
pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked for more coming to the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under a right-handed whip,
lost the advantage while still on her inside lead inside the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show.
DRESSY bumped with an opponent at the start, settled just off the pace, tucked into the three path into the turn, shifted five wide while roused at the
five-sixteenths, spun into the stretch under a drive and came up empty. JOQULAR was fractious in the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the
three path early on the turn, dropped back passing the five-sixteenths and tired. WHO KNOWS WHAT dwelt at the start and came out around ten lengths
behind the rest of the field, was ridden along at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, was put to the whip coming to the five-sixteenths, swung six
wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DIPPING IN retained the advantage after out-breaking the competition, cleared onto the inside a few jumps into the run around the clubhouse bend, was
lightly coaxed along, feeling some pressure from rivals positioned in paths two and three, ventured onward under the same scenario for nearly
three-quarters pole, stepped into the lane, was initially being ridden out, got switched over to stronger handling on the verge of entering the furlong grounds,
built up her largest advantage between the eighth pole and the sixteenth marker, availed of some trouble that had just occurred a short distance up the road,
hooked up with HARD WON in a spirited tussle during the final stages, gamely fended that foe off. HARD WON away without apparent mishap, was well
rated within range in path two, raced on the far turn from between rivals, got cued up for the drive home, briefly shied inward and away from GIGGLE
FACTORY, stayed within striking distance of the the winner, tipped back to the outside in midstretch for better racing room, out-muscled GIGGLE
FACTORY for position soon afterwards, clawed her way towards the one to catch, vied with vigour matched up with DIGGING IN starting in deep stretch,
got denied. CHECKSANDBALANCES (IRE) at on near the inside route in pursuit of the front runners until the conclusion of the backstretch, proceeded
along keenly, with the pilot lightly steadying the mount at times to counteract it, got eased towards path two after entering turn two, swung out approximately
five wide into the lane beginning the move after three-quarters had been reeled off, lugged in after a right side shot in the general area of the sixteenth pole,
paused in hand with KARLEY O lurking just off her heels before having the rider go back to work, flashed late foot rallying for the show. GIGGLE FACTORY
secured a forward position on the homestretch, worked out a tuck into the two path at the top of the clubhouse bend, forced the issue from between rivals
until the quarter pole, got set down for the drive, came out a couple of paths after a couple of left side shots in midstretch, met up CHEROKEE SONG,
herself coming in one path after a solitary shot from the opposite, saw the twosome make solid contact in addition to squeezing KITTEN'S ROMANCE and
knocking out any remaining interest in her, was then bullied out of her path by the second place finisher, stayed late to be the fourth to cross the finish line.
CHEROKEE SONG settled into the two path after the field had been sent on its way, got eased one wider shortly after entering the backstretch, was put to a
hard drive after the third fraction had been finalized, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, came in after some right side pressure in
midstretch, bumped soundly with GIGGLE FACTORY, bore co-responsibility causing KITTEN'S ROMANCE, a short distance behind at this juncture, to
check and lose whatever shot she had remaining, made no late headway. KARLEY O spotted the field a two length head start after scraping the side of the
starting gate, was sighted fighting on the bit being worked onto the rail, took it until the end of the second bend, angled four wide for the drive, was in hand
briefly off the heels of CHECKSANDBALANCES in the neighborhood of the sixteenth pole, made no impact. WE FIVE took the inside route, cut the corner
under a drive, gave way. KITTEN'S ROMANCE vied at the outermost of three from path three for over six furlongs, got let out spinning into the lane, fell
back a bit during the early stages of the stretch run, checked getting squeezed in midstretch, never regained any interest. Following a Stewards' Inquiry
focusing on the stretch drive, GIGGLE FACTORY and CHEROKEE SONG were each disqualified and subsequently placed seventh and last respectively for
having causing interference.

Footnotes
JACK AND NOAH (FR) broke alertly and went straight to the front then quickly sped clear, opened up a very sizable advantage under his own power,
rounded the turn in the two path, responded well when set down while still on his inside lead in upper stretch, switched to the proper lead inside the
three-sixteenths, remained well clear into the final sixteenth, swapped back to his inside lead just before being given one crack of a right-handed whip inside
the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under steady handling. COMPETITIVE SAINT was hustled from the start then urged along in the second flight,
saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch under the whip and finished willingly for the place. BUY LAND AND SEE settled off the pace,
went around the turn in the two path, was roused outside the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch and improved position to get the show.
ISLAND COMMISH broke out and bumped with a foe, bumped lightly with OLD CHESTNUT early, settled on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was
roused late on that bend then driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. FLAP JACK settled towards the back, went around the turn in the
two path, was roused outside the quarter-pole and failed to threaten. MAVEN was bumped at the start, settled on the outside in the second flight, was urged
along leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn then was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. OLD CHESTNUT
bumped lightly with rivals early, settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn, moved off the rail late on that bend then swung six wide into the stretch and
was no factor. POWER UP PAYNTER bumped lightly with a foe early, settled on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was given his cue late on that bend
and failed to rally. (Rail at 27 Feet)

Footnotes
SWEET BYE AND BYE rated along attending BLOWOUT from the outside, drew abreast as six furlongs was being completed, settled in at the head of the
stretch and was fed its cue, responded and continue to chip away at the deficit, began the final furlong with very little separating the top twosome, went at it
eye to the eye with nemesis the rest of the way to the wire and gamely got the job done. BLOWOUT (GB) established the top shortly after the field had been
released, got guided onto the inside at the crown of the clubhouse bend, was held in reserve by the pilot leading the way, tailed by the top one, herself a
path farther to the outside, saw that opponent increase her presence as three-quarters was being reeled off, got roused as a fierce fight between them was
ignited, saw SWEET BYE AND BYE forge to the slimmest of leads inside the eighth pole, battled onward only to have to settle for second. CATCH A BID
sat reserved two wide in midpack, swung out into path three for the stretch run, failed to make any headway on the duelers. CLARA PEETERS (GB) cut
over to the rail after making light contact with ATOMIC BLONDE in the shadow of the starting gate, eased to the outside travelling on the backstretch,
departed it from the two path, got sent out four wide into upper stretch, made no impact. ATOMIC BLONDE remained stationed along the inside route after
brushing with CLARA PEETERS right after the start, pulled rankly on the bit for much of the trip on the first turn, ventured onward saving ground tracking the
front runners, cut the corner into the lane, weakened. JOY EPIFORA (ARG) taken hold of after breaking slightly to the outside, went on to save ground for
six furlongs, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, had no punch. MOLTO BELLA brushed at the start, rode the rail
until the end of the bend, tipped out two wide at the top of the lane, lacked a response.

Footnotes
MADAM MACLEAN just off the inside just off the pace, came under light coaxing nearing the quarter pole before being roused tipped three wide into upper
stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong getting bumped by BOMBSHELL as that rival came inwards a furlong out, seized command
knocking heads with that foe at the sixteenth marker, dug in gamely getting carried in in the final steps and prevailed on the wire. BOMBSHELL (IRE)
tracked the pace just off the inside from mid pack, tipped four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued four wide into
upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final eighth coming inwards and bumping the aforementioned foe at the eighth pole, dueled through to
the finish with that rival noses apart for command, carried in her rival near the finish while fighting gamely but was bested at the end. THRILL dueled inside
of AMERICAN GODDESS from the get go coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
clinging to the front until collared inside the eighth pole, kept on to win the battle for the show honors. AMERICAN GODDESS dueled from the two path with
THRILL to her inside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on through to
the finish but was bested for the show honors in the last strides. BASTET chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued just off
the inside for home, dug in under a drive and was outkicked. LET THEM EAT CAKE broke in at the start bumping BALLERINA SHOWGIRL, chased three
wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. ARCH OF FIRE got away a beat slow and lost her lane at the start,
chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered four to five wide
into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the finish passing a pair of rivals to the wire. BALLERINA SHOWGIRL (GB) bumped at the start by LET THEM
EAT CAKE, who broke inwards, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. ADMAA chased along the inside coming under a ride at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and came up empty.
