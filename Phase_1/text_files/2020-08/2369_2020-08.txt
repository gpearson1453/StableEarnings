TAPSOLUTION dueled inside for the lead, continued to duel with COSMIC HALO on the far turn, shook free at the top of the lane, kicked clear and held on
well late, driving. SECULAR STAGNATION raced off the pace with an inside trip, came two wide into the lane, angled out at the eighth pole and finished
well outside. PREFERITO DA BARBI raced three wide early, then stalked two wide, bid three wide on the far turn and was outkicked in the lane.
SOURNOIS raced off the pace, off the rail, moved up three wide on the far turn, came wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. NOT TODAY SATAN
steadied at the start, raced off the pace with an inside trip and rallied mildly on the rail. MAINTAINANCE MATT was reluctant to load, tracked close up
inside, waited briefly for room on the far turn and lacked a bid. METROPOL raced three wide on the first turn, stalked three wide and had no rally. COSMIC
HALO dueled two wide from the outset, dueled on the far turn and weakened in the lane. ICEBIRG LET US raced off the pace between rivals and had no
rally. GLASS EATER had a four wide trip racing off the pace and failed to threaten. BOOKIE'S BLUES raced off the pace, went four wide past the quarter

Footnotes
CARIBBEAN (AUS) pressed the pace from the outset, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled outside of VICE VERSA entering the stretch, put a head in front,
then was all out to prevail in a long stretch drive. VICE VERSA set a pressured pace on the inside, showed the way on the far turn, dueled into the stretch,
dug in gamely along the rail in the final furlong and battled to the end. FRA MAURO raced off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn, was asked to chase
the leaders and lacked a stretch rally. ANOTHRDAYATTHELAKE raced off the pace, inside on the far turn and failed to threaten. CROSSTIME raced inside,
was checked at the seven furlong marker, then stalked the leaders, chased on the far turn and faded. SIXTO was steadied after the start, raced off the pace
two wide and gave way.
