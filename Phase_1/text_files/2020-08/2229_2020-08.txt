Footnotes
COOL ENOUGH set the pace in the two path, drew off in upper stretch and widened while trying to get in a bit under steady left-handed urging.
PRETTYHAPPY tracked the pace three wide in the four path, never threatened the winner and stayed on to be clearly second best. ADMIRAL'S GARNET
pressed the pace outside of the winner and weakened in the drive. RIDE LIKE A GIRL failed to menace while racing two and three wide. FROST WARRIOR
played no factor while racing two and three wide. MELANIE'S PRIDE had only brief speed inside.
