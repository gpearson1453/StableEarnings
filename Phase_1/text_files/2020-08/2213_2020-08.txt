Footnotes
HELEN MAE'S SONG shared the lead just outside KIPPER DOODLE, moved clear inside the final furlong, angled in some, lengthened command and held
the latter at bay under steady handling. KIPPER DOODLE disputed the pace inside rivals, did not stay with HELEN MAE'S SONG inside the last eighth,
altered out quickly then steadily bore out as she closed the gap through the waning yards. MY FOUROONE KPLAN boxed in behind the early speed, angled
out on the bend, came four wide into the stretch, lacked the extra needed in the late going but proved clearly best of the rest. SPONTANEITY was a step
slow at the break then altered in when her path was taken shortly after that, advanced along the rail on the turn then leveled off. BOOHOO SUE in
contention between rivals on the backstretch, fade two wide on the bend. STAR MAGNA raced in the second flight from outside in the early going but also
gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
ITALIAN CHARM waited behind GARRISON COMMANDER on the backstretch, got through two wide on the second bend and took the lead, was clear
leaving that turn, slowly drifted out under a drive in the stretch but held sway. TOCCETIVE JAC settled early, progressed just off the inside on the turn,
fanned four wide for the stretch run, gained second midstretch then could only make up minor ground on the leader in the late going. COOL AMBITION was
hustled from the gate, settled inside on the backstretch, angled out leaving the second turn, waited for room behind TOCCETIVE JAC and GOLDEN
DRILLER upper stretch, gained a clear path with a furlong to go and gained third. GOLDEN DRILLER pressed from outside, went for the lead three wide on
the second bend but gradually wore down for the drive. GARRISON COMMANDER was sent to gain a clear early lead but began to wear down before
finishing six furlongs. DAVKA was a factor from outside for a half mile then began to fade.

HOLD THE SPENDING stalked the early speed from outside, went for the lead three wide on the turn and shook free with a sixteenth left. G CITY
WARRIOR advanced from inside on the bend, swung out to path three for the stretch run and passed between rivals to gain second late. MINING FOR
PEARLS broke outward, soon was vying for the lead from outside, edged ahead two wide on the turn but slowly wore down the last furlong. COUNTRY JO
forwardly placed just off the inside, angled out four wide into the lane, progressed to midstretch then leveled off. SWIFTY CAUSE was steadied when her
path was taken nearing the bend, advanced three wide on the turn, fanned out for the stretch run and improved position without threatening. SOUTHERN
ATTACK chased from outside, two to four wide taking the turn, progressed to midstretch then leveled off. MEETMEINSTLOUIE unruly in the gate, displayed
early speed from inside, was steadied when her path was taken at the half mile marker, angled out shortly after that and steadily faded. PHOENIX ATTACK
was a factor between rivals on the backstretch but gave way two wide on the bend. BARBIELLO contested the pace between horses on the backstretch but
gave way along the rail before finishing a half mile.

JETS A GINNIN was quickly clear, showed the way in hand, was put to a drive the last eighth and proved much the best. SHEZAHOTMAMA broke on top
then veered outward, was settled inside, commenced her bid along the rail on the turn, was all out in the final furlong and caught COUNTRY ASSETS for
second. COUNTRY ASSETS made her bid along the rail on the bend and gained second, angled out some entering the lane, was no match for JETS A
GINNIN and began to wear down through the waning yards. SHOWIT without early speed, was just off the inside on the turn, fanned out some into the
stretch, angled to the outside with a furlong to go and passed tired rivals. BIT MONEY raced in contention just off the rail but began to wear down with two
furlongs left. LONG LEGGED LINDA was an early factor but faded three wide on the bend.

CREAL WONDER bumped with UNCLE PADDY at the break, vied for the lead between horses from the beginning, gained the rail on the turn, floated out
some into the stretch, moved clear, was all out as he began to wear down the final furlong and held on. WILDWOOD SECRET disputed the pace outside
CREAL WONDER, did not stay with that one upper stretch, came again to his weakening rivals through the waning yards but was too late. UNCLE PADDY
bumped with CREAL WONDER at the start, was settled, advanced three wide on the turn, lost ground fanning to path five into the stretch, rallied the final
furlong but came up short. COUP DE VILLE settled outside, picked up his pace along the rail on the bend, made a strong move the last eighth and narrowly
missed third. TAP'S BIG SHOT pressed from inside on the backstretch, angled out through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out.
COMMENDATION broke on top but steadily faded from along the rail.

Footnotes
SHMILY was forced out into TALES OF WAR at the start, vied for the lead outside SIRCORRI, moved clear on the bend and gradually widened command
under a drive in the lane. STORMY PACIFIC was bumped solidly shortly after leaving the chute, stayed close just off the inside, waited for room on the turn,
gained a clear path leaving the quarter pole, battled inside GO FOR SHERRIE for second and held that one at bay. GO FOR SHERRIE angled in trying to
keep a clear path shortly after leaving the chute and bumped solidly with STORMY PACIFIC, was angled back out, progressed three then four wide through
the turn, fought for second in the stretch but did not have enough left. TALES OF WAR was steadied back from crowding at the break, chased from outside,
widest through the bend then passed tired ones in the lane. SIRCORRI broke on top and outward, vied for the lead from inside, did not stay with SHMILY on
the turn, swung outside that one leaving the bend and continued to yield. SERIOUS TALK prominent from inside on the backstretch, angled out through the
bend, was four wide into the stretch and had no late bid. WILLOW RIDGE pressed from outside but began to tire two wide before finishing four furlongs.

YABA DABA DOO was settled between rivals early, advanced three wide on the bend, fanned to path five for room entering the lane, closed well and got up
in time. W W KAN DO vied for the early lead from outside, moved clear approaching the turn, floated out into the stretch, lengthened command but began to
wear down inside the last furlong and was narrowly outfinished in a game effort. MR. LUV MAKER chased from midpack, was just off the rail on the bend,
fanned four wide for the drive, closed well between rivals, was too late but clearly best of the rest. CITY POSITION also settled in midpack on the
backstretch, had the rail on the turn, floated out some into the lane and was also closing the gap deep stretch. GONZO was steadied back from crowding at
the break, settled outside, angled in nearing the bend and rallied belatedly along the rail through the stretch. GREAT GRET well placed inside, did not keep
up leaving the turn, swung out six wide into the stretch and flattened out. COUNTRY COOL void of speed, was just off the inside taking the bend, angled out
widest upper stretch and failed to have a significant bid. WILDWOODSUMMERTIME prominent just off the inside, angled out some nearing the turn for a
clear path, did not keep up three wide on the turn, swung out seven wide for the stretch run, gave way and had to be vanned off after the race.
