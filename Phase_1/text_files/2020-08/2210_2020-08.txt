Footnotes
VALYCOVE was jostled between horses at the start, chased the leader early, dueled a foe on the far turn before dueling with another foe down the stretch,
exchanged bumps as the rider stood up in the irons at the sixteenth pole while herded by inside foe and had a short burst of energy at the end to prevail.
RIKER was unhurried off the rail, moved up nearing the far turn, rallied to split foes on that turn, engaged the winner in a long duel, bumped with that one
down the stretch and led in the final yards before yielding. ORIGINAL INTENT trailed to the stretch and came up the rail for the show. DR. BAGLEY was the
lone speed early, vied with a foe while inside on the turn, and faltered in the final furlong. MANSOOR chased off the lead and lost position down the stretch.
PETE MARWICK was bumped at the start, steadied twice up the backstretch and lost position in the lane.

HE'S THE SOUPERWON bit sluggish from the gate, rushed three wide into first turn, took over after the half and went clear in the final furlong. CHEAP
SHOT between horses first turn while well placed but proved no match for winner in the lane. DR. BASKIN with winner at the half but could not keep up and
faded from inside through the stretch run. LION LION had speed from inside to the half but weakened from that point and faded from down on the rail.
PRESSONREGARDLESS no speed throughout with minor improvement in the stretch run. PRE FLIGHT was never prominent from inside throughout.
SWIFTY SAM never reached a contending position. SMART AND BROKE was always outrun. ADOLFO close between horses into first turn but backed up
quickly thereafter.

Footnotes
CONGRUITY bumped a horse at the start, took the lead off the rail on the first turn and widened down the stretch. PRIMED FOR TALENT tracked in
second, took the two path on the far turn, battled between horses for place down the stretch, briefly lost position but got up under pressure to re-take
second.. CHAMPAGNE PAPI stalked from third while widest on the backstretch, vied for place down the lane but just missed at the wire. RUSHED settled
mid pack early, was shaken up for run inside on the far turn, angled out and bumped a horse in the lane and tired while staying fourth. CROWN TO THE
GOLD tracked up close, was bumped in the stretch and tired at the eighth pole. TERMINAL SPEED raced between horses at the rear and was no threat.
ZANFORCE was unhurried last, moved up on the turn, took the six path into the stretch and faded. WHOLE LOTTA RUN was urged nearing the turn and
lacked a response.

MY GIRL ROCKET unhurried early, rallied far outside from far turn, sustained a four wide bid and cleared off as much the best. PASSALLTHECANDY
tracked leaders to far turn, went after leader off rail out of the turn while no match for the winner. KOJO'S QUEEN perfectly placed to far turn, made a mild
bid past the eighth pole while outfinished in the late going. BUTTER UP KATIE no speed to far turn, launched the widest run passed quarter pole with no
late gain and leveled off.in the stretch MALICED alternated on lead to quarter pole and gave way readily from there. LATINA CANTINA never a contender.
BLUEGRASS JUSTICE good position to the half and gave way, dropped back badly. SHE'S A QUEEN inside to press pace for a half but gave way
suddenly with, no excuse.

Footnotes
HONEST GAL away well while confidently handled to the turn, roused and responded to draw clear smartly in the stretch while geared down final sixteenth.
BIONIC ROSIE pressed outside to turn, took up and chased to no avail while best of the rest. YES I'S A MILLER good position outside to turn, lost ground in
the stretch run and settled for show spot. RHODA'S JEWELL off tardy, raced back to the turn, improved position only late. BEAUTIFUL CREATURE
bothered at the start, inside to turn, angled out into stretch split horses, no late gain. COMPETITIVE QUEEN had a shoe repair in the paddock, sprinted
clear quickly but was headed out of the turn and folded in the stretch run. SHE GOT IT through early from inside and dropped back. NO VA MAS had a
steady fade. MAGNA BELLE was through early dropped back. TUBE SOX ROCK was never a factor. GRAMS REVENGE took a bad step early on, pulled
up in distress and subsequently vanned off.
