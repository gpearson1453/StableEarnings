Footnotes
STAR SUNDAE led in between five horses vying for the lead, entered the turn two wide, passed along the inside by rival at the eighth pole, quickly
reengaged and passed rival, responding well to urging a driving clear of rest of field. LOUDER CALIFORNIA vied for the lead three deep, stayed in pressing
position through the turn three wide, entered stretch in three path, gamely responded to urging and finishing second best. SLIGHTLY stalked the dueling
quintet in the three path, stayed off the rail and three wide in the turn, tipped out into the stretch to the six path, made a good rally under steady urging to get
up for third. YOUR ADORABLE vied inside on the backside, stayed along the rail through the turn, took command at the eighth pole, lacked the need punch
late to make an impact late under steady urging along the rail. UNCHANGED chased leaders four deep on the backstretch, maintained pressing position
into the turn four wide, began to weaken approaching the eighth pole and lacked needed response in the lane. BELLIGERENT chased five deep on
backside, stayed wide entering the turn five wide, entered turn in the five path and understandably lacked needed finish to make an impact late.
