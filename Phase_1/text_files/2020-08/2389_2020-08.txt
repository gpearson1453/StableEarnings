Footnotes
PERFECT JUSTICE quickly established a clear advantage, widened her margin around the turn while in hand, met a meager challenge from SALLY
SOLUTION in upper stretch, but responded when roused approaching the furlong pole, kicked away again from that foe, then was ridden out through the
final sixteenth. SALTY SOLUTION was forwardly placed two wide and outside of the loose leader, inched closer turning for home to offer a bid in upper
stretch while still multiple lengths behind the leader, but failed to match strides with that foe at the furlong pole, then held place between horses in the late
stages. ABBY'S LUCKY HEART tracked along the rail in midpack early on, retreated exiting the backstretch, then steadied inside of foes into the far turn
and trailed the failed at the three furlong pole, but recovered stride around the turn, split foes two wide in upper stretch, then rallied along the inside through
the lane, but failed to catch SALTY SOLUTION for place. CRYPTO CAT trailed early on, advanced in the four to five path around the turn, then offered a
late rally outside of rivals, but missed show. ENGLISH RULE raced off of the pace two wide early on, saved ground around the turn after clearing ABBY'S
LUCKY HEART into the turn, but failed to factor. GARDEN OF EDNA broke flat footed, raced far off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, and
never got involved. KEE SHE chased along the inside, but weakened turning for home. Due to a timer malfunction, the quarter mile time was omitted.

Footnotes
AUNT HATTIE (IRE) was restrained in the early stages to allow others to make the pace, stalked along the inside, got a bit rank from that restraint through
the first turn, waited patiently behind the leaders around the far turn while KYNANCE (IRE) made first run, loomed under a hard hold behind the trio of
leaders turning for home, shifted four wide straightening into the lane, produced a rally via a vigorous hand ride, and got up in the final stages. V J'S BET
broke outwards, prompted the slow pace two wide, bid then dueled for the lead passing the five furlong pole, vied between horses turning for home before
kicking clear of those foes in approaching the furlong pole, but hung on her left lead through the lane, and was worn down in the final sixteenth. KYNANCE
(IRE) got keen due to being restrained off of the pace in the early stages, stalked two wide, made first run around the far turn and bid for the lead outside of
the pair of leaders at the quarter pole, but was repelled by V J's BET approaching the furlong pole, then got outfinished by AUNT HATTIE (IRE) in the final
furlong. AWESOME ONE set a slow pace in hand along the inside, dueled for the lead inside of V J'S BET after that foe bid at the five furlong pole,
continued to vie around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
WANDERING WEST stalked the leading trio of duelers from the four path early on, tucked down to the two path into the turn, loomed behind the leaders at
the five sixteenths pole, split the leaders two wide after. FAST CASH dueled for the lead two wide and between horses early on, drifted out to the three, then
four, path at turning for home after his outer foe weakened, forged a narrow advantage in upper stretch, but was challenged by WANDERING WEST along
his inside quickly thereafter, and got outfinished by that foe through the final furlong. JOHNNY TIZNOW dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but gave
way approaching the furlong pole while hanging on his left lead. GOOD YEGG dueled for the lead three wide, but weakened passing the three furlong pole,
then lugged in on his left lead in upper stretch. COLONEL DOYLE broke in and bumped at the start, trailed the field by a distance, got a bit green at the half
mile pole, and showed little. ART I RICH broke inwards and was off slowly, then was always outrun, and showed little.

Footnotes
NIAGARA CHARLIE set the pace along the inside, dug in to maintain an advantage from multiple bidding turning for home, and held gamely through the
lane. BIG UNION tracked from midpack along the inside while a bit off of the rail around the first turn, advanced on his own power between horses to a three
wide stalking position down the backstretch, produced a three wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but failed to kick away, hung, was repelled by the
leader in midstretch, the prevailed in the place duel via a head bob. TEXAS GANO was forwardly placed two wide, vied between horses turning for home
and into upper stretch, but was fended off by the inner leader, then dueled for place inside of BIG UNION through the late stages, but lost the head bob a
the wire. IN EFFECT took a solid bump from an outer foe at the start, tracked from midpack in the three path around the first turn, advanced in hand while
shifting inwards around the far turn to loom behind the leading trio turning for home, hugged the rail to the three sixteenths pole, shifted four wide at that
marker, but lugged in from right handed pressure at the furlong pole, and failed to produce a bid. FEBRUARY SON broke inwards and solidly bumped a foe
at the start, saved ground far off of the pace along the inside, advanced mildly in the three to five path around the far turn, then stayed on willingly through
the lane while drifting a bit in on his left lead. CANDY MOVER was forwardly placed along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leaders passing the
five sixteenths pole. TIJUANA BRASS broke in and was hard to handle at the start, raced far off of the pace two wide, but was rank and darted to the five
path into the first turn, settled in the two path around that bend, but came under a drive passing the seven sixteenths pole, saved ground while lacking a
response around the far turn, then passed tired foes in the four path in upper stretch. RUN RABBIT was rank early on, saved ground around the first turn in
midpack, but failed to factor. BAYTOWN JAXX stalked four wide, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole. ENRAGED hesitated at the start, then
shied inwards from a rival, raced far off of the pace in the five path around the turns, and never got involved. GOOSE DOWN GREY was outrun, and
showed little.

Footnotes
STORMY CACTUSA broke outwards causing MY NORTHERN STAR to be squeezed at the start, chased the leader five to four wide down the backstretch,
bid for the lead and forged a narrow advantage passing the three furlong pole, dueled two wide as the early leader dug in, but kicked clear from that foe at
the furlong pole, and won going away. VAPOR POINT set the pace in the two path down the backstretch, but was headed by STORMY CACTUSA at the
three furlong pole, dug in and dueled with that foe around the turn and through upper stretch, but proved no match at the furlong pole, then held place
between oncharging rivals at the wire. LOCAL HONEY was off slowly and trailed the field along the inside, shifted off of the rail to the four path passing the
five sixteenths pole to commence a rally, but was fanned seven wide turning for home, but sustained his rally through the lane with good courage, but
missed place. REED O'PRADO chased the pace along the inside, saved ground around the turn, then kept on along the rail through the lane, but was nailed
for show at the wire. CHUY was forwardly placed three to two wide and between horses, but faded. WEBER shifted off of the rail to the three path between
horses into the turn while far off of the pace, and failed to play a factor. BENNETT was forwardly placed two wide and between horses, but steadily faded
into and around the turn before getting shuffled back turning for home, and failed to make an impact. DOC'S BLUE TIPPER was bumped at the start, lied in
range of the leaders six to five wide and outside of rivals, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. MY NORTHERN STAR was sandwiched between
horses at the start, raced far off of the pace in the four path before swinging to the six path between horses turning for home, but failed to produce a rally.
Following a Stewards' Inquiry reviewing the start, no change was made to the original order of finish.

Footnotes
YOU GO BOY prompted the leading duelers three wide, inched forward in hand to bid for the lead passing the five sixteenths pole, had the rider take a look
back approaching the quarter pole, took over and kick clear of rivals in upper stretch with a strong surge, then held sway through the final furlong under
driving pressure. MEROCKETMAN was forwardly placed four wide, bid for the lead four wide at the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace and proved no
match for YOU GO BOY in upper stretch, then held placed while hanging on his left lead through the lane. WING AND WHEEL raced off of the pace in the
three path, advanced in the three to four path turning for home, altered out for clear racing room approaching the furlong pole, quickened and rallied through
the final stages, but missed place at the wire. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER dueled for the lead two wide, but was no match for an oncharging foe turning for
home, and weakened. LOVE THAT SURPRISE bumped an inner foe at the start, was forwardly placed two wide and between horses, but failed to keep
pace with the leaders turning for home. FIVE GRAND was backed out of the gate after being fractious, jogged for the veterinarian before being reloaded,
then raced far back early on, advanced slightly in the five path into the turn, but flattened out turning for home without menacing. SATURDAY TRYST
dueled for the lead along the inside, but weakened turning for home. STILL CHIEF chased the pace along the inside, but weakened at the five sixteenths
pole. CLOSE THE CASE trailed by a distance around the turn, and was no factor. ITS JUST FATE was bumped and crowded between horses at the start,
shifted to the six path into the turn while far off of the pace, and did not play a factor.

Footnotes
BYBEE lied in range of the lead five to four wide and between horses down the backstretch, inched forward to vie outside of a trio of foes a the three furlong
pole, forged a lead turning for home and drew off with a good kick in upper stretch, then was kept to task to the wire. IKEISGREAT pressed the pace two
wide and between horses early on before chasing the pace from the pocket around the turn, shifted four wide and between horses passing the three
sixteenths pole to produce a bid, rallied, but was no match for the leader and proved second best. SAMURAI CAUSE trailed early on, took the turn three
wide and far off of the pace, then swung seven wide turning for home and rallied outside of foes for show. SKY RIDE chased the pace three wide early, but
was outpaced to be far off the pace into the turn, shifted from the two to the six path turning for home to produce a bid, but was outfinished by an outer foe
for minor rewards. CASH NOW prompted the pace three to two wide and between horses around the turn, but failed to keep pace with those foes passing
the quarter pole, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, then got outfinished for minor rewards. HIGH CRUISE was off a step slowly, but advanced four
wide and between horses down the backstretch to bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, vied between horses around the turn, but was no match for his
outer rival in upper stretch, and faded. BENNY was fractious in the gate, saved ground in midpack, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. WILLFRED
tracked from midpack six to five wide and outside of rivals, but weakened at the quarter pole. CATES SWOOSH was reluctant to load, set the pace along
the inside, but was headed at the five sixteenths pole, then weakened while hanging on his lef tlead.

Footnotes
POSEIDON'S PASSION broke a bit inwards, stalked along the inside, saved ground from the pocket around the turn, split the leaders passing the furlong
pole under a hand ride, then drew off in the final sixteenth under driving pressure. GIFT WRAPPED dueled for the lead along the inside of JE SUIS BELLE,
was headed by that foe at the three furlong pole, but held inside position around the turn and reclaimed the lead in upper stretch, but was challenged by
POSEIDON'S PASSION at the furlong pole, proved no match for that foe at the sixteenth pole, then held place. JOYSOME saved ground around the turn
while off of the pace, shifted smoothly to the four path approaching the furlong pole, and rallied through the final stages, but missed place. JE SUIS BELLE
dueled for the lead two wide, held an advantage around the turn, but was repelled by her inner counterpart approaching the furlong pole, and weakened
through the late stages. THE BEAUTY'S TALE was forwardly placed three wide, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but flattened out in upper stretch, and
weakened. CLAUDETTE NONSTOP stalked the pace two wide early on, but was restrained by the rider, dropped back between horses down the
backstretch, was far off of the pace along the inside into the turn, saved ground around the bend before shifting to the five path through upper stretch, then
finished up willingly. DISCERNMENT had a slow start, raced far off of the pace in the four to five path around the turn, and stayed on mildly. FLAT
MEADOW raced four wide and off of the pace early on, advanced to midpack around the turn, but weakened at the furlong pole. CHARGAREE was rank a
few strides out of the gate, trailed the field, took the turn in the five to six path, and did not play a factor. SHE'S NO DRAMA chased the pace three wide
between horses from midpack, but never got involved.

Footnotes
SON OF BATMAN was bumped at the start, set the pace along the inside, drew off to a clear lead into the turn, then held sway through the lane under
driving pressure. OSCAR P Q was outsprinted early, rallied in the three to four path through the latter part of the turn before shifting to the five path in upper
stretch, then flew late to just get up for place. BRAVO EXPRESS stalked along the inside, saved ground and forged place from an outer foe at turning for
home, but only chased the loose leader through the lane, then got nailed on the wire by an oncharging foe for place. YOUNGBLOOD prompted the pace
setter from the outside, vied at the half mile pole, but failed to keep pace and proved no match for that rival at the three furlong pole, then weakened turning
for home. ONE EYED JOHNNY bumped by an inner foe at the start, was forwardly placed three wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with
those foes at the quarter pole, then kept on through the lane. GRAN ROJO was forwardly placed four wide, but weakened at the quarter pole. ALL STAR
JUSTICE reared when the gate opened and was off many lengths behind the field, rallied in the three to four path around the turn, then stayed on past tired
foes through the lane. AMAZING TIZCAT raced off of the pace in the two path around the turn, and failed to menace. G AS IN GEORGE bumped with an
inner foe at the start, took the turn in the two path in midpack, and failed to factor. MIGHTY CONTENDER was squeezed early on, trailed, and never got
involved. PURE EQUINE bumped with an outer foe at the start, pulled along the rail in midpack, but weakened into the turn, and was eased through the
