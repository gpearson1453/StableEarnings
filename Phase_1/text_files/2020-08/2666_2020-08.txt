Footnotes
I GET IT was unhurried early, threaded through with a decisive three-wide run between horses past the quarter-pole, took over outside GOLD COUNTRY in
upper stretch and drew off under a mild drive. KATIESDREAMGIRL broke a step slow then lost her footing a stride out, swung four wide rallying off the far
turn, and was along for the place. GOLD COUNTRY cleared inside with the early lead, rated along through an even tempo, and yielded through the lane.
SMARTY QUEEN bumped with NEW DELHI leaving the first turn, saved ground on the far turn, and lacked the needed rally. LEARNT was outrun early
inside, came three wide into the stretch and passed tired horses. NEW DELHI got bounced around between SMARTY QUEEN and JOYFUL PRAISE as the
first quarter-mile was being completed, stayed in range for six furlongs, and tired. BEAUTIFUL TIZ dropped back inside entering the far turn, and had no
response when called on. SHAKEM prompted the pace outside GOLD COUNTRY for six furlongs, and gave way readily. JOYFUL PRAISE was strung out
five wide into the first turn, bumped with NEW DELHI approaching the backstretch, moved up outside after a half-mile, and retired soon after that.

Footnotes
KICKS ON SIXTY SIX pressed the pace outside ORULA and EL GUAPO, took over after completing three-eighths of a mile, kicked clear into the stretch
and was all out to hold sway. BASTIEN LE BROWN advanced four wide approaching the stretch, and rallied with good energy. ORULA led early, got joined
from both flanks after a quarter-mile, battled between horses around the turn, and ran on for the show inside. FIRSTCADETE raced four then three wide
around the turn, and was one-paced while a bit green through the lane. SILVER DOLLAR CITY got bumped by EL GUAPO and steadied at the start, and
tired after three furlongs. EMIT broke slowly, and was outrun toward the inside. EXIT RIGHT broke slowly, angled wide off the turn, and dropped far back.
EL GUAPO stumbled and bumped into SILVER DOLLAR CITY at the start, was sent through on the rail to poke a head in front of ORULA after a
quarter-mile, vied to near the five-sixteenths pole and stopped.

Footnotes
HARD WEST went up to contest the pace between EL GRAN PICHON and OXSENAL after a quarter-mile, gained the upper hand and edged away in
upper stretch, and was driving to the finish. OXSENAL argued the pace three wide, could not match strides with HARD WEST turning for home, lugged in
through mid stretch and went clear of the others. MAGICAL CAUSE lacked early speed, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and improved on the
far outside staying on his left lead. EL GRAN PICHON bumped with GRAY BULLET after the start, hustled up inside to get the early lead, was under a full
drive inside OXSENAL and HARD WEST by the five-sixteenths, and weakened through the drive. DISCREET DANNY broke in bumping SMARTY J AND B,
and gave way three wide before going a half-mile. GRAY BULLET broke out bumping PACHI, then was pushed in by the latter and squeezed back between
horses, and never reached contention. SMARTY J AND B got bumped by DISCREET DANNY at the start, and was always outrun. PACHI was bumped by
GRAY BULLET at the break, then came in pushing that one into EL GRAN PICHON, and retired early inside.

Footnotes
YOLANDA'S PRIDE saved ground behind the leaders for six furlongs, was guided out three wide getting roused near the top of the stretch, caught MARIES
MELODY from outside past the eighth-pole and moved clear under good handling. MARIES MELODY prompted the pace outside MIJET, took over in upper
stretch, but could not withstand the winner. AFFICIONADO (FR) settled in the two-path for six furlongs, moved out for the drive and was along for the show
without threatening. MIJET grabbed the lead inside with an alert beginning, put down some sharp fractions for six furlongs, and weakened. GALILEOS
BALLERINA was a step slow at the start, and never factored. CHEZ PAREE trailed inside.

Footnotes
RESTOFTHESTORY broke on top despite hitting the left side of the gate, sprinted clear inside, widened around the turn going comfortably, and was hand
urged through the lane. MASTERING BELA chased outside RESTOFTHESTORY throughout, and was clearly second best. NAJWA raced four then three
wide around the turn, and could not gain on his left lead. BLUE SAGE shifted out four wide approaching the lane, and could not gain through the late stages
on his left lead. BEYOND HEAVENLY broke awkwardly, and was never prominent. ALEXANDRA AM I raced three wide, and tired after three-eighths of a
mile. TREES THUNDER hesitated at the start, and was always outrun. PRETTY PRINCESS showed brief speed inside, and dropped far back in the stretch.

Footnotes
SEPTEMBERTEN waited patiently behind the leaders past the five-sixteenths and into upper stretch, came through a tight opening between FREE FLAY
and FIVE OF HEARTS with a furlong remaining, kicked away under a mild drive and was hand urged late. FIVE OF HEARTS broke out bumping NEW
YORK STYLE, vied outside FREE FLAY to the stretch, and dug in to hold the place. ROYAL DUKE broke in putting a hard shoulder into NEW YORK
STYLE, tracked outside the leaders to the lane, and lacked a solid bid in the four-path. FREE FLAY vied inside FIVE OF HEARTS to the stretch, and
weakened through the last eighth of a mile. NEW YORK STYLE got slammed from both sides, bobbled and took up at the break, advanced after a half-mile
three then four wide, but could not sustain the rally. PALIMPSEST saved ground to no avail. CAN'T HAVE ENOUGH was outrun throughout. WITH A BIT
OF LUCK brushed the right side of the gate and veered out sharply coming out behind the others, and was never prominent. OBJECTIONS BY THE RIDER
OF NEW YORK STYLE AGAINST FIVE OF HEARTS AND ROYAL DUKE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AT THE START WERE NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
SARASOTA COUNTY bumped lightly with KOBE FIFTY TWO after the start, sprinted off to a clear early lead inside, and was kept to pressure to stay
comfortably in command. GETTHE MUNY BERNIE hugged the rail behind the leaders around the turn, stayed inside and edged SMALL FORTUNE in a
battle for the place. SMALL FORTUNE raced close up three wide from the outset, and was outfinished for second. TACO waited inside around the turn,
lacked a clear path attempting to get in gear through the furlong grounds, brushed CABLE CHANNEL while altering course outside, and offered a mild final
response. CABLE CHANNEL shifted out four wide leaving the turn, brushed with TACO past the eighth-pole, and lacked a solid bid. KOBE FIFTY TWO
bumped lightly with SARASOTA COUNTY after the start, chased between horses into the turn, and faded after three-eighths of a mile. MALRAUX raced
four wide around the turn in range, and faded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MILES AHEAD bounced off the left side of the gate and was slowest away, got taken out widest and hustled along soon after that, moved to the leaders in
the four-path after a half-mile, took over through upper stretch and drew off under pressure. ELLAS MY LOVE challenged for command three wide under a
drive between horses late on the turn, could not go with the winner into the lane, and ran on second best. MY FRIEND FLAVIN raced in the two-path for a
half-mile, moved out for the drive and lacked a solid bid. TOWN CLASSIC saved ground outsprinted early, shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, and
had no rally. STONE HANDS dashed clear early, got hooked by ALLURSTRA into the turn, lost the lead near the five-sixteenths, and had already given way
when forced to take up and swerve out behind ALLURSTRA in upper stretch. ALLURSTRA pressed STONE HANDS from outside, reached a short lead late
on the turn, had just been overtaken by MILES AHEAD when he suffered a catastrophic injury to the right front at the top of the stretch, and lost the rider
near the eighth-pole. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
VIBURNUM stayed close in the two-path for six furlongs, shifted out with aim at the leaders into the stretch, ran by from outside 70 yards out and drew clear.
BLUE PAYNT got bumped by GULF COAST GAL at the start, stalked TONALA from outside to the far turn, took over approaching the stretch and moved
inside, and fought gamely on the rail through a long drive to save second. GULF COAST GAL broke awkwardly to the left and bumped BLUE PAYNT, was
keyed up into the first turn under restraint and had to be taken out four wide, ranged up outside BLUE PAYNT to loom a threat turning for home, lugged in
through the furlong grounds in a bid for the lead, and weakened through the late stages. WORKIN ECLIPTICAL broke slowly, advanced along the inside
after six furlongs, but lacked a final response. SAMURAI FIGHTER lost her footing at the break and was slow to begin, and never became prominent.
TONALA set the early pace inside, got collared before completing six furlongs, and folded up. ZAP MAMA was three wide on the first turn, and was through
soon after going a half-mile. INDY FRONT was forwardly placed outside early, retreated around the far turn, was pulled up and walked off.
