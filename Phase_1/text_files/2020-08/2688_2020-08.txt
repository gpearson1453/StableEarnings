Footnotes
DIXIE'S CROSSING rated off the pace and off the rail then started a four wide bid nearing the three eighths pole, drew to even terms two deep midway on
the far turn, took the edge at the eighth pole and widened through the final sixteenth. CRYPTOSONDE settled off the pace inside, rallied to the lead three
wide past the three eighths pole, was met at even terms midway on the turn, headed into the lane then dropped back mid-stretch and flattened later yards.
PAP'S LEGACY settled back off the rail then started an outside bid into the backstretch, but flattened stride the final sixteenth. WEAVING YOU BEHIND
stalked the pace two deep and moved to even terms midway on the opening turn, took the edge into the backstretch but was caught past the three eighths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then weakened. FIGHTING CHANCE rated a short early lead inside, was met at even terms at the nine sixteenths pole,
ceded the advantage into the backstretch, gave chase from that point but faded toward the far turn and was eased. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
CASH FOR THE SOUL gave chase toward the inside then eased to the two path into the turn, closed to the lead nearing the head of the lane and dug in
under steady encouragement to discourage the efforts of GEORGE TOWN CAT who was eased toward the outside for racing room and gave chase,
rounded the turn five wide and finished well at the outside flank of the winner. JOOPSTER chased the pace off the rail, rounded the turn in the three path
and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. WIZARD OF ODDS gave chase outside, raced in the six path of the turn then flattened stride. BEARCAT
KITTEN chased the pace inside but was boxed in nearing the end of the turn and showed little more the final furlong. CASTLE FIVE was hustled along with
the early lead, angled in nearing the quarter pole but was caught toward the top of the lane, showed no further response and was not asked for more.

Footnotes
LIAM'S LOOKOUT stalked the pace off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep midway on the far turn, raced clear while
drifting out into the lane but dug in under steady encouragement to draw off. MY BLONDE MARY accelerated to the lead toward the three quarter pole and
rated the pace inside, came under pressure past the three eighths pole but was caught at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened the final furlong.
ENCHANTED NILE hit the stall gate upon exit then closed toward contention, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the
four path, drifted a bit into the lane and was along to take third later yards. ROLLICK rated off the early pace inside, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened stride. PEARLY QUEEN settled off the pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase
from the three eighth pole, rounded the far turn still in the three path and showed little more. MISS CHEENY raced well off the pace and mostly saved
ground. ANSHI broke a step slow and never factored. FEARLESS KITTEN dropped well back.

Footnotes
SHE FIGURES settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn then started a four wide bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced three wide on the far turn,
dueled to the lead inside the eighth pole and drew off the final sixteenth. TWO IN THE BUSH rated a slim lead at mostly even terms, dug in to fend off

THANK YOU GIRL rated close off the rail the first turn then started a three wide bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep midway on the far
turn and was steadily handled to draw off. VENETIAN DRIVE stalked the pace two deep then took the lead leaving the three eighths pole, drew clear toward
the five sixteenths, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn and proved no match the final furlong. MAIDU saved ground off the early pace then bid
nearing the three eighths pole, improved off the rail on the far turn but showed little further. REYANA REYA DREAMS saved early ground well off the pace
then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the seven path and passed some rivals outside. JUST WHAT I NEEDED raced in
the four path the opening turn and settled off the pace leaving the turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three
path and showed little more. BARRACUDA angled to the inside to set the early pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught past
the three eighths and gave chase from that point but faded leaving the five sixteenths. RUN BY raced well off the pace. MY MISS AQUARIUS showed little
response after rounding the first turn in the three and four paths. PADRINA saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths
pole but faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
UAINTSEENMECRAZYET dropped well off the pace and saved early ground, bid into the backstretch and steadily improved while angling to the seven path
on the far turn, then dug in through the lane to take over later yards. WAKES UP HAPPY was forced out nearing the seven eighths pole and settled off the
pace in the three and four paths, bid into the backstretch and raced in the six path of the far turn but was outfinished through the final sixteenth. LIL
SWEETHEART rated the pace inside then came under pressure into the backstretch, kept the edge nearest the rail and raced clear of Barker Lane leaving
the far turn, but was caught flattening stride the final yards. HARMONIC THUNDER saved ground off the pace, bid toward the three eighths pole and
rounded the far turn at the rail, then flattened stride through later yards. THUNDERTURTLE raced well off the early pace and well off the rail, left the second
turn outside and bid leaving the three eighths pole, angled inward on the far turn then eased outward in the stretch and finished well. BARKER LANE drifted
outward nearing the seven eighths pole then stalked the pace, challenged into the backstretch and dueled to remain close to Lil Sweetheard while two deep
on the far turn, but drifted while dropping back nearing the eighth pole and weakened from there. ALLEGHENY DBL LIME settled off the pace in the two and
three paths then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, though, faded toward the far turn. NUVE NEGRA raced in the five path the first two
turns and faded through the backstretch. Congress Hall ran loose in the post parade and was a late Stewards scratch.
