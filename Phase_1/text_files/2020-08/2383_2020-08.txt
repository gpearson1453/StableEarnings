Footnotes
LINCHPINS WAKE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear. LIVING
LEGEND pressed the pace of MADISON ANNE from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths pole, led into the stretch but could not
match strides with the winner late. SHES GOT THE POWER was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out
further into the stretch and finished with a belated bid. STAND IN YOUR LOVE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half.
JOHNNIE GUITAR lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. MADISON ANNE was bumped at the start, set a pressured
pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
SPITTIN IMAGE broke inward, dueled for the lead from the inside with STAND TO, vied with that rival through a vigorous drive and held off the closing
TIME'N TIME AGAIN to gamely prevail. TIME 'N TIME AGAIN broke sharply to stalk the dueling leaders while racing four-wide, rallied through the final
furlong and just missed. STAND TO was bumped at the break, disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide, vied for a prolonged drive and
gave way in the final yards. LONG LANCE was bumped at the start, chased the leaders while racing three-wide and lacked the needed closing response.
BID IN THE BACK settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and failed to menace. THE THIRD RING
lagged, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DON'TBESHYWILLIE was away in good order to duel for the lead with DUDLEY STUDLEY from the inside, vied with that rival into deep stretch, edged
away late and held off the closing SEATTLE SMOKE to prevail. SEATTLE SMOKE raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with
a furlong to run and was gaining on the winner late. KALAKALA was reserved just off the leaders early, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good
energy. DUDLEY STUDLEY disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final sixteenth. GENERAL MACH FOUR
was off a step slow and checked, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to menace. CATS GULCH lacked early foot,
raced five-wide through the turn, drifted in nearing the quarter and was not a factor. SHOCKAZULU showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn
and did not offer a bid. COASTAL SON lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention.

CREST DRIVE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. CATS TOUCH raced unhurried early, advanced
five-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. BERNIE was reserved just off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the turn and finished willingly. DALLON'S GOLD was forwardly placed from the outset, saved ground through the turn, reached a
striking position but lacked the needed late response. TRUST N LIBERTY showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
BURTON ERNIE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
DAZZLING DEBBI tracked the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the seven-sixteenths marker, opened a clear margin with a quarter to
run and drew off with complete authority. BELLAMAGIC lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but
finished well to gain the place. COMRADERY lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a late
bid. EXCESSIVE BELIEF was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. LADY IN GREEN showed no early
speed, raced off the rail through the turn, checked in mid-stretch and finished evenly when clear. VERAAJ was away in good order to set a pressured pace
while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. AT U LOVER showed brief speed and weakened. CARDS N COFFEE broke sharply to
press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. LOOKFORTHEDIMPLE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the
turn and weakened.

Footnotes
KILLARNEY LASS sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. ALITTLELESSTALK
chased the pace of KILLARNEY LASS while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. DONTKISSNTELL was
forwardly placed early, dropped back nearing the three-eighths pole, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. DIAMONDS R
steadied soon after the start, raced just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and lacked the needed late response. MAGICAL SPELL
showed no early speed, saved ground though the turn and was not a factor. PADDY'S SECRET was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn
and did not menace. FORTUNE'S FREUDE was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. THE RIDER OF DIAMONDS
R LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST ALITTLESSTALK CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF HIS MOUNT AT THE FIVE-EIGHTHS POLE AND AFTER
REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
EDDIE AND THE KING broke sharply to duel tor the pacesetting chores from the inside, opened a clear margin into the stretch and was fully extended to
hold off the closing PISTOL POWER by a diminishing margin. PISTOL POWER raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled
out into the stretch and just missed. DOUBLE A. PROSPECT settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch
and finished willingly. CHECK AND RAISE lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with
good late energy. INDYGO BO dueled for the lead from between foes, moved three-wide through the second turn and gave way after going three-quarters.
JACKSON TELLER was away alertly to press the pace while racing four-wide and gave way after going six furlongs. CANDY'S MARTINI was forwardly
placed early, moved five-wide through the second turn and weakened. SWAY ROAD raced five-wide through the first turn while settling off the leaders,
moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened. LONG GAME was off slow, showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the first turn and did

Footnotes
MAGIC MAHOGANY stalked the pace of SOVEREIGN NATION while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and
drew off through the final furlong. SOVEREIGN NATION was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing
the five-sixteenths pole but could not match strides with the winner in the drive. HE'S BANDIDO settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with some late run. BIG HEATER raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached a
contending position but failed to sustain his rally. MY FIRST TRIP disputed the pace from the inside with SOVEREIGN NATION from the inside and gave
way after going a half. PEACE PRINCE lost the irons soon after the start, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. TOKELAND raced off the
pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. HIGH POINT lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was
not a factor. PRANCERS KAT was off slow, lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn and did not reach contention.
