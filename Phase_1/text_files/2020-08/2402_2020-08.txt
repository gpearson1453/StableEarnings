Footnotes
MAGIC AT MIDNIGHT had good early speed from the outside, moved clear and crossed over to the inside, showed the way into the stretch, felt some
pressure from RAKASSAH in upper stretch but responded well and drew away from the runner-up under right-handed urging. RAKASSAH (IRE) broke well
then stalked the leader near the inside, kept along the rail through the turn, showed a mild bid in upper stretch but proved no match for the winner. ROAD
RAGER chased inside, saved ground around the turn and held the show. GOTHAM DESIRE traveled two wide through the turn, steered out at the top of the
lane and gained a minor award. MARIAH GIRL (ARG) off a bit slow to start, tucked inside on the turn and lacked a rally. NORMA'S LOVE chased outside a
rival and two wide into the lane and flattened. TIP TOP GAL hopped leaving the gate, chased off the rail, two to three wide around the turn and proved no
menace. SAINTS PAYNTER hopped at the start, tracked outside a rival then three wide on the turn, drifted out into the stretch then further out in the lane
and tired.

outside the runner-up in the lane and wore down rival for the victory. COMMANDER KHAI sent for the lead, set the pace and moved to the inside, inched

show. HARLAN ESTATE tracked between rivals to the lane and went one-paced through the final furlong. RUN SNAPPY steadied early from the inside,

DESTINY'S JOURNEY away quickly from the outside, steered to the inside entering the first turn, controlled the pace near the inside then came off the rail a
bit, was urged a few times right-handed and remained clear to the wire. OPERATIC chased between foes on the first turn then a bit off the rail, angled in on
the second turn, awaited room along the inside, gained a clear path then angled out in the stretch and finished well. MONGOLIAN WINDOW stalked outside
a rival then three deep past the half-mile marker, got fanned five wide into the lane and kept on to earn the show honors. PERFECT ICE STORM a bit rank
into the first turn, chased a bit off the rial then between foes, floated out four wide around the final turn and got edged for the show. AVALON RIDE stalked
the pace inside, drifted out into the three path leaving the bend and tired. SENORADIABLO went three deep or four wide around the first turn, tracked off the
inside, moved out and got fanned six wide into the lane and came up empty. LESEDI stumbled leaving the gate, traveled three deep into the first turn,
between runners on the backstretch, came three wide into the lane and was never a factor.

Footnotes
RAYMUNDOS SECRET well placed along the fence, saved ground around the far turn then tipped out entering the stretch, steered out mid-stretch and
bumped rival past the eighth pole, rallied three deep and got up. TAPWATER took command and moved inside, challenged by ELLIE ARROWAY around
the far turn, fought back into the stretch and through the lane, held foe at bay but could not fend off the late charge from the winner. ELLIE ARROWAY
stalked outside a rival, closed in on the leader and headed rival at the quarter pole, battled down the stretch but failed to find the needed final kick. ZEE
DROP unhurried in the beginning while angling over to the inside, moved out on the backstretch and traveled three wide into the far turn, moved out a bit
further entering the stretch and produced a late bid to earn a minor award. STRIKE AT DAWN tracked, inside, pulled past the five-eighths pole, floated out
by rival entering the stretch, crowded and steadied past the eighth pole and kept on to the wire. LOVE AND PEACE (FR) tracked outside a rival, traveled
three wide then asked at the quarter pole, chased through the drive under urging, bumped by the winner at the eighth pole and weakened in deep stretch.
HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
RUN LIKE KONA vied between rivals for command, dueled with ENRICHED BY DEB around the turn, lost a bit of ground but stayed alongside into the
stretch, came back on and took control inside the furlong pole and edged away. CHOLLIMA knocked into rival at the start, raced in range while off the rail,
came four wide into the stretch and rallied for the place. ENRICHED BY DEB vied inside in the early stages, dueled with RUN LIKE KONA around the bend,
relinquished the lead past the eighth pole and held the show. SUEZAAANA stalked near the inside, drifted out into the stretch, came out near the eighth
pole and finished willingly. BIG GAME PLAN asked early while lacking speed off the pace, went two wide into the stretch and produced a mild rally.
WARREN'S EMPRESS broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, settled off the inside then went between runners on the turn, came three wide into the
stretch and flattened. VIVE L'AMOUR bobbled at the start, was in tight and checked early, kept along the inside and never rallied. CAUGHT IN A TRAPPE
bumped leaving the gate, tracked wide up the backstretch, went five wide around the turn and weakened. ARYA'S DAGGER broke out and bumped at the
start, chased off the rail then three wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. FOREHEAD KISSES off slow and shuffled back at the beginning, raced
four wide into the lane and was never a factor. SWEET REGARDS vied three deep to the turn, could not keep pace around the bend with the top pair,
bothered by rival near the three-sixteenths pole and gave way. CHRIS IS READY bumped at the start, stalked outside a rival, raced two to three wide
around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
JEWEL THIEF dueled for the lead early then chased the leader into and around the turn, angled out and bid outside MAJESTIC GIGI into the stretch,
gained command in the lane and drew clear. SUGAR PICKEL trailed a bit off the rail then angled in on the turn, rallied along the inside and outkicked
BRITTLE AND YOO for second. BRITTLE AND YOO chased inside then moved out a bit leaving the turn, angled out near the eighth pole, finished well and
missed the place. MAJESTIC GIGI dueled for the lead then moved clear near the three-eighths, angled over to the inside and cut the corner into the stretch,
overtaken near the eighth pole and faltered late. MEAN SOPHIA crowded early then angled in and chased inside, kept along the fence to the stretch, drifted
out in the final sixteenth and lacked further response. RAIN DIVA tracked two wide through the turn, bothered by MEAN SOPHIA drifting out in the final
sixteenth and never rallied. MUNNY raced wide to the turn, four wide into the stretch and weakened in the lane. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
WHOOPING JAY angled in early and tucked inside on the first turn, moved a bit off the rail then was taken back nearing the half-mile pole, came out into the
lane and further out in the stretch, closed fast and caught CALI CALIENTE in the closing moments. CALI CALIENTE set the pace under pressure from
BENCH JUDGE, inched away briefly before being pressured again by that rival, dueled from the inside into the stretch, cleared once again but could not
hold off the winner. JETOVATOR allowed to settle in the early going, moved closer up the backstretch, traveled three to four wide into the lane, rallied
between rivals in the final furlong and finished a game third. BENCH JUDGE pressed the pace outside then dueled into the lane, challenged through the
lane but got outkicked in the late stages. SEA OF LIBERTY unhurried in the beginning, raced two to three wide on the first turn then angled in, closed in
along the rail up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, asked in the lane but lacked room at the eighth pole, looked to have an opening only to
see it close again at the sixteenth pole and was not persevered with late. GOLDEN DOUGHNUT tracked outside a rival, went up to be a part of the pace
three deep at the nine-sixteenths, continued three deep into and around the far turn, lost ground and chased three wide into the lane and weakened. MAKE
IT A TRIPLE traveled along the inside early then moved off the rail, went three wide into the far turn then angled out to enter the stretch five wide and
proved no menace. OFFSHORE AFFAIR pulled early, drifted out on the first turn, stalked off the rail, went two to three wide into the lane and had little left
for the stretch. HAND TIMED.
