Footnotes
UNCLE BULL led quickly and moved to the rail, set a reserved pace, was pressured from mid turn, shook clear upper stretch and was all out to hold.
JUNGLE FIGHTER got away slowly and closed to mid pack, was hustled along the rail through the turn then launched a determined drive and got up late to
garner the place position. ARMISTICE DAY pressed the pacesetter, moved up outside UNCLE BULL late turn, dueled briefly, was headed upper stretch and
chased to the end. PIONEER MAN, rated off the early pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch and rallied gamely
outside. PERFECT TAPATINO (FR) settled in mid pack, was hustled two-wide late turn but failed to menace. FINAL JEOPARDY, away slowly and off the
pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
EXECUTIVE SIGHT was bumped by FINE GRIT just out of the gate and settled off the pace, closed to mid pack, chased two to four-wide on the turn, rallied
outside and was up on the wire. CONSTANTINO stalked the pace, chased three-wide late turn, rallied, led in the final furlong but was caught on the wire.
ELUSIVE RO, in range, closed three and four-wide on the turn, dueled into the stretch, led for a jump or two before being passed then chased to the end.
PERLARANA settled off the pace, closed to mid pack, chased from the rail on the turn, was game but lost his path in the final 70 yards and was through.
FINE GRIT exchanged bumps with TWO TIMING leaving the gate and bumped EXECUTIVE SIGHT as well, raced in mid pack, chased three and four-wide
on the turn but evened out in the final 16th. NASHVILLE KNIGHT forced the pace from late backstretch, dueled from mid turn, led upper stretch but gave
way in the final furlong. FRONT NINE, in range, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch then lost his path 70 yards out and was
done. TWO TIMING exchanged bumps with FINE GRIT early then settled off the pace, chased two-wide on the turn, moved into the stretch but lost his path
with a furlong to run and evened out. AURORA D'ORO led early, was pressured late backstretch and into the turn, dueled from mid turn, gave way
approaching the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
ROLLING SLOAN cleared quickly, was stalked and pressed by a rival into and around the turn, kicked clear of foes in upper stretch and held a safe margin
driving to the wire. GLAMOUROUS GIRL sat in mid pack before advancing three to four wide into contention late turn, fanned out into the six path turning
for home and closed resolutely, getting up for the place late while outside. SOUPER PECAN broke out at the start, settled in mid pack along the rail,
followed the winner in upper stretch and tipped out to make a run by the eighth pole but couldn't match that rival's late energy, nailed late for the place as
well. OHEAVENS moved up from mid pack while three to four wide on the turn, fanned out into the eight path turning for home, closing well while wide for a
minor award. HELLO FRIENDS was steadied back early, closed three wide into range on the turn, tipped out looking for a seam in upper stretch before
dipping back inside by the sixteenth pole, closing mildly when clear. SOULA sat in mid pack, moved up four to three wide on the turn and was out in the
seven path turning for home, finding her best stride late closing fast the final seventy yards. SEAMIALAUGH was in the two path into range behind the
leaders in upper stretch before shifting to the inside, but was on her wrong lead and flattened out in the final sixteenth. STARONTHEHORIZON settled in
mid pack while in the two path around the turn, shifted out into the five or six path in upper stretch but stalled in the final seventy yards. PIVOTAL WOMAN
(FR) steadied at the start, rushed up between rivals to press the leader and winner quickly, stayed on and bid top stretch but wilted in the final furlong.
NORTHERN ALLURE was bumped at the start and steadied back to near the rear, angled off the rail in upper stretch but could only rally mildly without
threatening. AMBITIOUS PRINCESS was off the pace, stayed four to three wide on the turn but could only pass a few stragglers down the lane. CORA
stalked the leader three wide throughout before tiring in mid stretch and falling back. DIVA DEVINE sat along the rail in mid pack, had a clear path in upper
stretch but had no rally. OHMYSHE'SSOFINE was steadied back to last early and never reached contention.

CHART broke alertly but was taken back to stalk the pace, closed two-wide on the turn, responded a 16th out and was up on the wire. AVIE'S SAMURAI
stalked the pace from the rail, took the opportunity presented when a path opened along the rail at the top of the stretch, quickly took command and drove
clear but failed to stave off the winner in the final yards. DIAMOND SPARKLES settled in mid pack, came two-wide through the turn, tipped out upper
stretch, rallied outside and was coming quickly but missed. TWO SIXTY showed her early spneed along with CHART but quickly inherited the sole lead
when that one dropped out of the duel, set a reserved pace, was headed upper stretch but gave way very grudgingly to the end. SARATOGA VISION raced
in mid pack, closed three-wide on the turn, hung briefly upper stretch then dug in and finished gamely. FLY SO PRETTY lost her path leaving the gate,
threw her head and was rank through the backstretch, settled and saved ground on the turn then finished evenly.

MRS. DEL forced the pace, bid early turn, dueled, shook clear upper stretch and held sway under steady pressure. BUNCHKINS pressed the pace, bid mid
turn, dueled three-wide, was headed upper stretch and chased to the end. DID I STUTTER settled off the pace, closed four and five-wide on the turn, came
widest to the top of the stretch and finished gamely to no avail. KARAKONTIE FLYER broke inward then moved up to stalk the pace, angled from the rail to
three-wide late turn and finished under a determined drive. FABIOLLA (GB) was pinched back at the start, raced in mid pack, angled two to four-wide late
turn then chased through the stretch. CLARKSON, away slowly and off the pace, was hustled from two-wide and the rail through the turn then rallied late
along the fence. NEPTUNE'S PEARL led quickly, set a pressured pace, was headed early turn and forced the issue, battled back but failed her bid upper
stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
BLAZING BOURBON was bumped between rivals at the start and settled off the pace, was hustled three then two-wide on the turn, rallied gamely and got
up late under a drive. SHANGHAI KIMMY closed late backstretch and led into the turn, set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch but failed
to hold the winner safe. SIMPLY A ZOOMER was bumped by BLAZING BOURBON at the start, raced in mid pack, closed four and five-wide late turn then
finished under a determined drive. TRAIL BLAZING ESSA, away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail and angled out wide leaving the turn
then rallied willingly. TYPICALLY, in range, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn, moved to the fence at the top of the stretch and finished all
out. WORDS OF GOLD moved to prominence alongside SHANGHAI KIMMY late backstretch, forced the pace three-wide but evened out in mid stretch.
LOST CORSAGE, in touch, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then flattened out in the final furlong. LEFOOTWOSTOMPS broke inward and
bumped BLAZING BOURBON, settled in mid pack, came two to four-wide through the turn then flattened out in the final furlong. BLONDE COURAGE
pressed the early pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then flattened out in the final furlong. FIVE SPARROWS, in mid pack early, dropped to
the rear approaching the turn, moved from three-wide to the rail then had no rally. ERICA'S ON BOARD set a pressured pace, was headed at the turn, fell
back a bit, was checked along the rail when TYPICALLY cut in front of her at the top of the stretch and faded.
