Footnotes
ABSTAIN raced in the four path on the first turn, stayed in the back of a tight group in the six path, was urged in the four path on the far turn, and moved up
to grind down the leader in a late bid. ROSEFINCH showed speed off the rail throughout and was nailed at the wire. THIRSTYFORAMIRACLE raced just
behind the leader, lost position in the stretch, then regained the show spot late. FINAL TRUTH stayed back to the stretch, came very wide and improved
position. WHODUNNITANDRAN ran beween horses on the far turn and was even from there. JERSEY PRINCESS stalked from inside early, split horses on
the turn and lacked kick while on the rail in the lane. CANTALOUPE ISLAND was off last, urged from the gate, last throughout and no threat.

Footnotes
CERNAN chased a clear leader while in front of the rest of the field by an even larger margin, inherited the lead on the turn and had just enough to keep the
win late. EL AHIJADO was bumped at the start, raced well back of the top two, came between horses into the far turn, closed while in late stretch but
needed more. AUSTRIAN was bumped at the start, raced four wide while well off the top two early, came into the stretch in the six path and was moving
best late. B SKY HIGH raced inside bunched foes that were staying well off a clear leader and improved position on the turn. NEPAL UP raced well behind a
clear leader, improved postion in upper stretch, but lost position in late stretch. DREAMS OF YVONNE sped to a clear lead and tired inside in the lane.

ACCOUSTICAL attended the pace early then vied outside that leader, took over on the turn and found more late to hold off a closer. DREAMMEISTER
raced inside in the second flight, made a quick three wide middle move on the far turn to gain on the leader but needed more late. ONE THIRTY NINE
waited, had some rally from the three path on the far turn, came very wide into the stretch and improved position late. SAXON LORD raced as inside speed,
vied from upper backstretch to the turn and lacked the needed kick in the stretch. PLAIN TALES was an unhurried last, raced in the five path up the
backstretch, was widest in the stretch, and improved position late. PRIMED FOR TALENT was inside on the far turn and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
DIXIE MOLL bounced a bit around the first turn, lagged back, made a steady advance, went clear. HOOSIER GOLD CASE dropped back from inside first
turn, found trouble nearing the eighth pole, switched leads and re-rallied and coming on too late. WICKED BETTY perfectly placed throughout, led a furlong
out but was outfinished for place SPECIAL CONQUEST off slow, far back to quarter pole, circled field, ran on late. MADAM NOVETZKE vied early on, drew
clear backstretch, weakened in stretch run. MY WYNTER ECHO never reached contention. THREE BIRDS step slow from gate, never a factor throughout.
TENAKEE close to leaders for three quarters gave way readily. ON THE COME through after half, faded back. MAGNA BELLE inside speed to the half,
surrender and dropped back.

far turn and lost position down the lane. KATIE THE CUTIE led inside on the first turn, dropped off the lead, angled in nearing the far turn and needed more

Footnotes
STRUT THE RING shuffled back rail, roused with a burst of speed going to the far turn, sustained the run and surged past in impressive fashion. HIGH
POWERED speed to the front, stayed to deep stretch while no match for the winner. LORD REVELSTOKE stumbled at the start, lost best chance with a
gallant effort for the show spot in the stretch run. ERNIE BANKS saved ground in good position throughout, had a clear run stretch but evened out.
IMPROBABLE STORY chased leader to the stretch but faltered in the drive. MR. CHOW raced four wide to far turn, out of gas with no late gain. MOUNT
CALVARY never a factor. GIANT HONOR stayed close from off rail to far turn but gave in readily. LEVANTO (ARG) rushed up outside first turn, stayed
close at the half but backed up from the quarter pole.

STONETOWN BOY was well back, came quickest on the turn in the five path, wore down the leader in the lane and won clear. CHEROKEE HAWK waited,
rolled in the three path on the turn, led inside down the lane and yielded at the sixteenth pole. KOBE BEACH raced well back, rallied inside on the turn to get
close, was unable to contain the top pair but ran best of the rest. HOUSE KEY angled in to the rail early, steadied while inside on the turn, then came widest
in the stretch. MR. BURNING MAN tracked off the leader's flank, rallied to lead on the turn, but tired in the stretch. MRWILLOUGHBY factored to the turn
and faded. BAYERN CREW was off last, rushed to the lead, and quit early on the turn, galloping past the wire.
