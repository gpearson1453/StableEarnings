stretch extending in the four path saving place. OLD MOUNTAIN LANE raced evenly through the turn angling out to upper stretch rallying late near mid
track. BIG GAME BOB away alertly led early then ceded on the turn saving ground to upper stretch weakening along the inside. DANG IT CASSIE played
no factor. CHARMING DEPUTY faded on the turn. A J'S MOJO was always outrun.
