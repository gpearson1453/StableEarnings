OVERWATCH prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, dug in determinedly under right handed urging in the three path through the final furlong, made
the lead late and edged clear int he final stages. FIRST ANGEL made the lead soon after the start, set the pace in the two path until deep stretch then
couldn't handle the winner. BRYCE'S ANGEL stalked the pace from the inside into the turn, began to rally, lacked room nearing the quarter pole, steadied
then leveled off. CLASSY NEKIA trailed into the stretch then passed tiring rivals in the five path. BAR CAT stalked the pace three wide into the stretch then
faded. LUNAR BUCK failed to menace. CATS VALENTINE was restless in the gate then no factor. TIZ SMART had speed four wide into the turn, swung
wide and stopped.

OFTEN ENOUGH with the second flight between horses two wide just behind the top pair, was put to a right handed whip along the inside on the second
turn, shifted out to the four path entering the stretch, engaged the pacesetter a furlong out, dug in determinedly and just got up in time. DANEFIELD away
alertly, set all the pace along the inside, dug in gamely when joined by the winner in mid stretch and just missed hanging on by the narrowest of margins.
TEAM HUCKY never far back, finished with good courage in the six path. LETSGETITSEVENTEEN stalked the pace into the stretch then faded. CITY
VOLUME was bumped at the start, settled with the second flight three wide, had speed into the stretch then gave way. NEVANS hopped outward bumping
CITY VOLUME at the start, prompted the pace for four and one half furlongs then folded. GOLDEN AFLEET trailed.
