Footnotes
CAPTAIN BOMBASTIC bumped hard with a rival at the start, recovered well to show good speed between horses then inside of a rival, dueled inside of
DREAM BIGGER while tight against the rail on the turn, continued a spirited battle with that foe into upper stretch, shook clear under a right-handed whip
coming to the eighth-pole, was placed under a hand ride while drawing off in the final furlong then was eased up late while much the best. DREAM BIGGER
had his head turned at the start and was unprepared, broke in and bumped hard with a rival, showed good speed on the outside, dueled outside of the
winner in the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, battled outside the winner while still on his inside lead until inside the
three-sixteenths then swapped to the proper lead, dropped back into the final furlong and proved no match but was clear for the place. CHOWDA was
moving around at the break and broke at the back, showed speed on the inside of two foes while sent hard, was eased back off the pace dispute midway
down the backstretch then shifted out, went three wide on the turn, came under a right-handed whip while still on his inside lead in upper stretch, switched to
a left-handed whip while continuing on the incorrect lead at the furlong marker and tired but was clearly best of the rest. SLASH GORDON bobbled at the
start then was bumped hard on both sides and taken up, settled well behind the rest of the field, was put to the whip leaving the backstretch, saved ground
on the turn, moved out some in the stretch and failed to respond. ARIESBERG bumped hard with rivals on both sides at the start, was ridden along on the
outside, dropped back while four wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
TIMELESS JOURNEY away last, got guided onto the inside route, sat isolated at the back of the pack while one-paced, flashed some interest for the initial
time as three-quarters was being rattled off, cut the corner hand ridden, fanned out five wide during the ensuing furlong, completed the maneuver full of run,
maintained it, rolling by PRINCESS FAWZIA in the final seventy yards to prove best. PRINCESS FAWZIA prompted the pace from path two, challenged in
earnest in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, took charge, got collared well inside the sixteenth marker, didn't have much trouble salvaging second.
COME STORMING underwent a two wide pursuit, got sent out four wide for the drive, flattened out. HURRICANE BREEZE tracked the pace from the
pocket, travelled about the far turn lightly hand urged, angled three wide into the lane, failed to fire. KEMBA off to a sharp beginning, retained the
advantage, glided over to the rail early on the clubhouse turn, carved out the pace, attended by the second place finisher from the outside, got put to the test
by that opponent at the three-sixteenths pole, relinquished then weakened steadily.

REJECTED AGAIN coaxed from the gate to establish the front shortly after the break, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from
PRINCIPAL DANCER to the outside, took to the two path through the turn and shook off that rival through the latter portion of the bend and continued just
off the inside for home, got roused inside the three-sixteenth while edging away, dug in under a drive as the field closed in late and held safe to prevail.
PRINCIPAL DANCER prompted the leader from the outside two to three wide down the backstretch, came under a ride at the three-eighths and was shaken
off through the turn, swung three wide for home and ran on to close in late securing the place honors. CONTINUUM bobbled at the break under hustling,
chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. I SAW IT ALL
inside briefly, tipped out to chase just off the inside coming under motivation at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made some late
headway. OUR AMERICAN STAR coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside for the opening furlong before tipping three wide with five furlongs
remaining, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and was outkicked.

STAGE LEFT bumped soundly with a rival at the start, recovered quickly to set the pace under pressure to his outside, inched away from two foes while
along the rail on the turn, moved to the two path nearing the quarter-pole, extended the lead into upper stretch, responded well when put to a right-handed
whip inside the three-sixteenths, dropped back closer to the rail into the final furlong, switched to a left-handed whip inside the eighth-pole then came back
out to around the two path and held under strong urging. COBBLE HILL was urged along off the pace, raced in the two path for most of the turn then
dropped to the rail, cut the corner into the stretch under the whip, pursued the winner in the drive and finished with good courage for the place. MAJESTIC
WEST bobbled hard at the start and was last to commence, was urged along on the outside, went three then four wide under stronger encouragement on
the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick while up for the show. MISTER BOBBY was hustled from the start, pressed the
pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under a right-handed whip, switched to a
left-handed whip in pursuit of the winner at the three-sixteenths, swapped back to a right-handed whip inside the furlong marker and weakened. QUEEN'S
MASON pressed the pace on the outside of the leader while loosely between horses, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back under a drive nearing
the quarter-pole, tossed his head briefly at the top of the stretch, lost ground into the final furlong, moved out from behind horses into the final sixteenth and
tired. SOUTHERN BRIDGE was bumped soundly at the start then dropped back, angled in at the rear then fell well behind under urging, saved ground on
the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and gained but failed to threaten.

Footnotes
PARTY AT PAGE'S hustled to establish the top, was switched over to much milder handling after entering the turn, showed the way, tailed by RUBY
STILETTO one path to her outside, edged away from the competition during the final stages of the run around the bend, arrived at the three-sixteenths
marker and was given its cue, began the final furlong possessing her largest lead, held late to preserve the decision. VIOLENTIAM set up in the pocket prior
to departing the backstretch, was patiently ridden keeping watch on the winner, was roused for the drive, tipped to be outside the top one with approximately
a sixteenth remaining, rallied mildly nailing down the place. TANGERINE DREAM gathered by the pilot after stumbling at the start, pursued the front runners
from path two on the turn, came under a ride spinning into the lane towards path three, flattened out in deep stretch. U SHOULD B DANCING two wide
entering the turn, was sent out four wide exiting it, made no impact. SHE'S A MAJESTIC travelled three wide on the turn, was closer to the rail at the
commencement of the stretch drive, got outfinished. B C BELLE departed the backstretch from path three, swung into the fourth one heading onto the top of
the lane, made no headway. ROSIES SURPRISE one of two leaving the post parade to sprint off without her pony, was towards the back of the pack taking
up the chase two wide, slid over to the inside midpoint on the turn, went on to save ground to no avail. RUBY STILETTO left the post parade early to sprint
off nearly to the end of the clubhouse bend, sans pony, proceeded to break alertly, sparred from path two matched up with the winner until late on the turn,
went about three wide into the stretch and was allowed to back away.

Footnotes
LADY ROCKET stumbled at the start recovering outwards and was bumped inwards by DOVIMA due to pressure from RAPIDO GATTA who broke inwards,
raced briefly in the gap of the clubhouse turn before extracting himself back inside the rail as DOVIMA altered to allow the move and found herself off the
heels of BLACK MAGIC WOMAN requiring a tight grip six furlongs from home, chased along the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing
five-sixteenths out, cut the corner into upper stretch in behind the leader, tipped to the two path at the three-sixteenths and then the three path just outside
the eighth pole and rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command in the very last jumps to the wire to prevail. BACK CHANNEL
prompted the pace of BLACK MAGIC WOMAN from the outside in the two path, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for
home, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was nailed in the final strides. DOVIMA got bumped between foes at the
start as LADY ROCKET recovered outwards from a stumble and BLACK MAGIC WOMAN was bumped inwards by RAPIDO GATTA, raced briefly inside
before tipping out to the two path to allow LADY ROCKET inside the fence of the crest of the clubhouse turn, raced unsettled facing kick back and was
tipped briefly three wide down the backstretch before tucking back to the two path nearing the far turn, tucked inside into that bend before tipping back out
two wide near the three-eighths moving around the backing away RAPIDO GATTA, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home,
dug in under a drive and kept on to secure the show honors. BLACK MAGIC WOMAN got bumped at the start by RAPIDO GATTA and in turn bumped
DOVIMA into LADY ROCKET, established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from BACK CHANNEL to the outside,
came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and relented inside the eighth pole, then weakened in
the late stages. VENUS OYZO chased two to three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late
going. BARISTA VIXEN three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. RAPIDO GATTA
broke in at the start bumping BLACK MAGIC WOMAN into DOVIMA and in turn LADY ROCKET, chased two to three wide under coaxing from three
furlongs out, spun just off the inside for home and tired.

Footnotes
BACKTOHISROOTS was taken in hand early then moved in while settling off the pace, went three wide early on the turn, was roused near the
five-sixteenths then shifted four wide, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed well under a right-handed whip while still on his inside lead, took the advantage
just inside the furlong marker then kicked clear and proved much the best while continuing on the incorrect under a hand ride late. GHOUL (BRZ) bumped
with a rival at the start, was urged along at the rear, went three wide on the turn, swung out seven wide into the stretch then moved further out and finished
with good energy to garner the place. MATTA bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, settled off the pace, was roused while inside on the turn, cut the
corner while asked for more into the stretch, continued along the rail under a drive into the final furlong, came out near the sixteenth-pole and narrowly
earned the show. HONEY WON'T bumped with a rival at the start, settled towards the rear, went four wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths,
came five wide into the stretch then quickly shifted further out, bumped with a rival inside the sixteenth-pole and improved position to just miss the show.
BATTLE STATION was urged along towards the front on the outside, went three wide on the turn, tipped four wide just after turning into the stretch while
roused for more, chased under a drive into the final sixteenth, bumped with a foe shortly thereafter and just missed the superfecta. SAYYAAF bumped with
a rival at the start then was hustled, sped clear and showed the way, went around the turn in the two path, was asked into upper stretch, led under a drive
into the final furlong, lost the advantage to the winner shortly thereafter and gave way. FAST GETAWAY settled outside under some urging, went four wide
under urging on the turn, chased under the whip into the final furlong, was forced out some near the sixteenth-pole and capitulated. NEW YORK'S FINEST
bumped with a foe at the start then was hustled, chased the clear leader from second, rounded the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch
under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. ROCKET HEAT was fractious in the gate, tossed his head while taken up early, settled on the
outside, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch then floated farther out and failed to respond. (Rail at 27 Feet)

Footnotes
NIGHT TIME away in good order, disputed the pace to the outside of the second place finisher, was towards the three path going about the task on the turn,
got called upon for more just before turning into the stretch, drew directly abreast of IRISH FRONT sparking off a spirited tussle, gamely got the job the done
at the conclusion of their stretch-long duel. IRISH FRONT grabbed the advantage shortly after the field had been sent on its way, carved out the pace from
path two, pressed by the winner one path farther off the rail, got roused for the drive home, batted hard versus the top one from the head of the stretch to
the finish line, wound up the one denied. WILD MEDAGLIAD'ORO allowed to settle into stride after stumbling at the start, advanced into midpack, took up
the chase from the four path on the turn, was still in it heading home, made no headway. FED FUNDS along the inside route in pursuit of the front runners,
was used during the run around the bend, got maneuvered into path six during the initial portion of the stretch run, becoming the widest of all, closed in to be
along in time for the final significant slice of the purse. FAMISHED taken hold of after breaking to the outside, sat parked out five wide on the turn, came
under stronger handling by the five-sixteenths pole, swung into the lane having remained in the five path, failed to gain ground appreciably.. BLINDWILLIE
MCTELL gave chase from path two, in between rivals for a good portion of the initial half, was set down in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, had
no rally. THE SICARII gradually spotted along the rail, went on to save ground to no avail.

SELFLESSLY brushed at the break by WINDRACER due to pressure from SUGAR FIX who broke inwards, raced just off the pace and got pinched and
bumped between foes as WINDRACER put the squeeze on rivals when tucking inwards and WITEZ attempted to hold her lane in behind SWEET MELANIA
just outside seven furlongs to run into the turn, tracked the front along the inside through the opening bend, took to the two path down the backstretch
before tucking back inside through the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch in behind SWEET
MELANIA tipped out slightly nearing the eighth pole, rallied with a good kick to confront that rival through the final sixteenth knocking heads briefly before
getting the nod on the wire. SWEET MELANIA tracked the pace along the inside in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the
corner into upper stretch, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat knocking heads
briefly inside the final sixteenth and was nailed in the very last jump to the wire by a bob of the head. WITEZ got jostled after the start when attempting to
hold the two path past the stands as SELFLESSLY and CAT'S PAJAMAS where crowded by WINDRACER tucking in and three horses attempted to keep a
seam barely usable for one, got taken hold of off the heels of SWEET MELANIA and angled in to the rail growing rank under the restraint with seven
furlongs remaining, settled better just off the inside through the first turn, tracked the front from mid pack along the inside coming under coaxing three
furlongs out, angled out six wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to secure the show honors in the final jumps. MICHELINE saved ground near the
rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied and paused briefly behind rivals awaiting a seam
nearing the sixteenth marker before nudging her way past a spent WINDRACER shoving that rival to the inside at the sixteenth pole and kicked on belatedly
for the last major share. SUGAR FIX broke in at the start bumping WINDRACER, raced forwardly placed and was under a firm hold three to four wide
through the first turn before settling four then three wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the far turn patiently handled until put to
coaxing just outside the quarter pole, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. AMERICAN GIANT two to three wide in pursuit
from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MY SASSY SARAH just off
the inside through the first turn, chased four then three wide down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the far turn coming under a ride at the
three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. WINDRACER (IRE) bumped at the start by SUGAR FIX who broke
inwards, came under coaxing and raced forwardly placed to show the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside at the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside for home under threat, yielded at the three-sixteenths and weakened through to the finish. VELVET CRUSH brushed the near side stall at the start,
raced just off the inside through the first turn and then three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the far turn and was placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide at the head of the stretch and was unable to make an impact. CAT'S PAJAMAS got bumped between foes at
the seven-eighths among jostling with a trio, chased just off the inside through the first turn then three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two
path through the far turn coming under a ride at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened.

Footnotes
BEYOND BROWN went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, vied two to three wide on the far turn, was roused to the lead in upper
stretch, fought with the runner-up under the whip into the final furlong then drew clear under strong urging. LITTLE RED BUTTON went to the front, set the
pace on the inside with company to her outside, was asked coming to the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner under a drive in upper stretch,
dropped back inside the furlong marker then switched out around the sixteenth-pole and proved no match but was well clear for the place. MEMORIES
ETERNAL saved ground on the first turn, settled comfortably off the pace, was urged along while inside on the far turn and lacked the needed response
while best of the rest. CAINUDOTHETWIST went four wide early on the first turn then shifted six wide, settled on the outside, angled in near the half-mile
pole, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond. SPIN YOUR PARTNER went four wide
on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked around the nine-sixteenths, dropped back while four then five wide on the far turn and
capitulated. DELLA LUTE bumped with a rival at the start, dropped well behind under urging early, saved ground on the turns and was no factor. MIZZEN
THE MARK came in and bumped lightly with a foe nearing the first turn, went five wide on that bend, settled on the outside, was through after going five
furlongs and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off. TONILEE bumped with a rival at the start, bumped lightly with another foe nearing the
first turn, went two to three wide on that bend, dropped to the rear late on the backstretch then fell well behind and was also eased but walked off.
