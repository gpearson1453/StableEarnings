Footnotes
LAUNCH THE POSSE seized command from the outset, held well into the stretch and was all out late. KELLEN CASH stalked, moved three wide into
stretch, closed the gap willingly and missed. BRILLIANT BABY was outpaced along the inside and showed mild late interest. NOT THIS AGAIN was always
outrun. FOURDANGSHORE never menaced. MALIBU BAY BREEZE took no part.
