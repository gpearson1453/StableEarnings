Footnotes
HOPPING HENRY set a clear pace well off the rail and held firm under a drive. ALLEN CAN DO IT tracked the winner two and three wide, closed outside
and was rapidly gaining late. TAPPIN FOR GLORY bumped with IN THE GOSPEL near the half-mile pole, chased the pace inside, lacked a rally and held
on for the show. JUST GETS BETTER was bumped nearing the half-mile pole, raced four wide in midpack and lacked the needed rally. IN THE GOSPEL
was bumped nearing the half-mile pole, raced two wide and never threatened. PISTOL P steadily faded three wide. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS was bumped
early, clipped heels nearing the half-mile pole and made little further impact. JUBA'S FANCY was outrun while racing four wide. The rider of IN THE
GOSPEL claimed foul against TAPPIN FOR GLORY for alleged interference nearing the half-mile pole but the Stewards ruled that too many horses were at
fault to penalize just one and allowed the original order of finish to stand.

RIVER CROSROAD RVF stalked the pace two and three wide, closed determinedly under right-handed urging and was up late. DOCTOR MCCOY set the
pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and led until deep stretch. LET'S GET PHYSICAL was in tight at the start, saved ground off the
pace and bested the rest. MODERN COWPOKE failed to menace while racing two wide. GHOST MINE saved ground off the pace early, went four wide
around the far turn and never threatened. CESAR AUGUSTO played no factor while racing two and three wide. MY FINAL NINJA was outrun inside.
WEAVING YOU BEHIND broke outwardly, rushed up to show speed inside and was through after a half.
