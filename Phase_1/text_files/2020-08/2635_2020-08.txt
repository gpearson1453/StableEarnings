Footnotes
MISS PINK was never far back, rallied the three path around the turn, took over entering the stretch and drew out under brisk urging. GROTON ST SCOUT
was reluctant to load, made a run three wide around the turn then flattened out. PATTY MAC'S GIRL steadied between rivals nearing the stretch then
continued evenly. BAYANNE found best stride too late. TIZA WEIGELIA bobbled a stride out of the gate, gained early position two wide then tired.
SHECOR was no factor. ROCKIN RUTH was hustled outside early, moved two wide to a short lead midway on the turn then stopped. WEEKEND
SERENADE was outrun. MERROW angled to the inside with the early pace then stopped in the lane.
