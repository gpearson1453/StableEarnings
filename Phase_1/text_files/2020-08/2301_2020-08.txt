drew clear and won easily. FLINT CORN allowed to settle, rallied determinedly in the six path through the stretch and finished second best. TAPAWAY
pressed pace the pace three then two wide into the stretch and was outfinished despite a game effort. FU ROO ran off briefly prior to loading in the gate,
was fractious in the gate, broke in front, set a pressured pace while getting slow fractions and weakened in the stretch. TANCAHUA moved up along the
inside on the far turn then came up empty. KANDY CHARGE was a forward factor for a half then faded. J STARR LINK pressed the pace tow then three
wide and was through after a half. IMA BELIEVER hopped at the start, moved up four wide on the backstretch, had speed into the stretch then came up
empty in the drive. BLUE MONARCH trailed.

CAKE POP with the second flight two wide, dropped inside the leaders as they drifted out at the top of the stretch,, surged under strong left handed urging
and got up in time. ALTISSIMO stalked the pace three wide form the five path, drifted to the eight path entering the stretch, dug in determinedly through the
final furlong and just missed. BUCKEYE BULLET pressed the pace two wide for a half, drifted to the five path while making the lead at the top of the stretch,
set the pace until the final stages and was outfinished despite a game effort. OVER ICCE failed to menace. DARE DAY broke in full stride to set the pace
while getting rapid fractions into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. DIAMOND DUST had brief speed. CAPTAIN CORN was outrun.

MOONLIT MISSION unhurried early near the inside, shifted out six wide nearing the far turn, drifted in slightly while splitting horses, bumped LEONA'S
REWARD as that one was forced outward entering that turn, closed rapidly, drifted out to the seven path entering the stretch while making the lead and
drew off to win as much the best. CIRCUS RINGS stalked the pace into the far turn, made the lead and quickly drew clear, set the pace into the stretch then
was no match for the winner. LEONA'S REWARD reared at the start, was unhurried while settling four then rive wide, was bounced around between horses
and forced outward slightly entering the far turn causing her rider to check then came on again late while no threat. TOTALLY OBSESSED close up,
dropped back on the far turn near the inside, shifted out to the middle of the racetrack entering the stretch and also came on again late. CALI DREAM
reared at the start, moved up steadily outside into the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. GRIZABELLA was through after a half. DRILLIT also unhurried,
ran up on heels while three wide approaching the far turn, shifted out bumping rivals, checked and faltered. DISTINCTIVE FLOWER chased the early pace
and was through after a half. ROLLIN ALL THE WAY moved up between rivals before a half then came up empty. TIZ WHAT away alertly, set the pace
along the inside into the far turn the tired. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDERS OF DRILLIT AND LEONA'S REWARD
LODGED CLAIMS OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE THREE EIGHTS POLE. AFTER REVIEW THE

Footnotes
MO DONT NO stalked the pace for a half, rallied three wide through the far turn to make the lead near the top of the stretch, set the balance of the pace and
drew away under right handed urging. I WANNA WIN never far back, angled out three wide on the second turn, rallied into the stretch and finished second
best. FOREWARNED close up from the start, split horses two wide past the quarter pole, loomed boldly along the inside before the furlong marker and
finished with good courage. LET'SCALLITEVEN passed tiring rivals. MOBIL SOLUTION chased the pace under a strong hold for six and one half furlongs,
inherited the lead two wide, had speed into the stretch then came up empty. GONE TOO SOON was no threat. VERISSIMO moved up four wide before the
far turn then came up empty. SEND ME ON was outrun. KING CREED sprinted to a clear lead entering the main track, set the pace fro six and one half
furlongs then flattened out.
