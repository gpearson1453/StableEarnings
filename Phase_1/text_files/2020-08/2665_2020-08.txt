EVERYBODY DOES IT chased the leaders to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch then rallied when set down and gradually wore down both
INDIAN DANCER and SIDE EFFECT (GB) late. INDIAN DANCER had the best speed, set a pressured pace to the second turn, was caught and passed to
the stretch but battled on late, could not stall the winner but gamely got second. SIDE EFFECT (GB) pressed INIDAN DANCER to the second turn, pushed
past that one three wide to the stretch, responded to mid stretch but could not shake loose and was outfinished late. TINK'S TWIRL tracked the pace to the
second turn, got outkicked three wide to the stretch but kept to task and closed the gap in the drive. PACIFIC STRIKE had no speed and saved ground to no
avail. SHE BEGAN AGAIN also had no speed, was off the rail on the second turn but came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
HEATSKY never far back to the second turn, followed LEMON DROP TINI inside to the stretch then had ample room when that one came off the rail, rallied
to get to terms leaving mid stretch and outbattled LEMON DROP TINI to the line. LEMON DROP TINI was pinched between CULTURED PEARL and
CANDY'S HONEY at the start, settled to the second turn, was inside while rallying to the stretch, came off the rail into the stretch leaving room for the
winner, battled that one determnedly but had the rider drop his whip at the end of the chute then was bested. SURFACE tracked the pace to the second
turn, raced four wide to the stretch, responded through the drive but could not impact the top two. ONLY THE FACTS pressed the pace to the half, was two
wide and pushed up to briefly loom a threat to the stretch but was outkicked in upper stretch and finished evenly. KAYDA had no speed, settled to the
second turn, came three wide to the stretch but did not threaten in the drive. CULTURED PEARL broke out at the start, was five wide on the first turn,
chased the pace, came four then five wide to the stretch and did not rally. FOGGY BOTTOM was allowed to settle early, raced off the rail on the second turn
also lacked a closing response. CANDY'S HONEY broke inward but hustled to the front, set the pace to the half, left room inside for LEMON DROP TINI to
the stretch and stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
NOLONGERAHOBBY never far back to the half, shifted off the rail and rallied two wide to engage the runnerup for the lead into the stretch, inched away
under urging to mid stretch and held driving. PIONEEROFTHESTORM set the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then was overtaken by
the winner but battled on to save the place. SEAU prompted the pace to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then
dug in to save the show. JIMMY G had no speed, was off the rail on the second turn then tried to rally inside but was in some traffic off heels leaving mid
stretch, had to briefly wait and lost the nod for third. MAJOR KONG was outrun to the half mile pole, saved ground on the second turn then shifted out and
was making up ground belatedly. IMPERATOR was four wide to the backstretch, stalked to the second turn, came three then four wide to the stretch but
weakened in the drive. MAGIC MOSCO settled mid pack to the second turn but had to circle four then five wide to the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
EDDIE'S PRINCESS was in hand early, bid two wide to the stretch, rallied when set down, battled SUPER BUNNY in the final sixteenth and got the nod.
SUPER BUNNY was outsprinted to the turn, circled four then five while rallying to the stretch, got to terms with the winner and battled determinedly to the
wire. GIFTY set the pace off the rail to the stretch, responded to pressure to mid stretch then could not hold off the top two. COMMISSIONESS had no
speed, saved ground on the turn, rallied to deep stretch then finished evenly. PLEASE ZIP IT pressed the pace to the turn, was caught four wide to the
stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then lacked a closing response. MAMANUCA trailed three then four wide to the stretch and made up ground belatedly.
CARIBOU CHIANTI stalked the pace to the turn, was two wide to the stretch then weakened. WAY TOO SWEET prompted the leader early, offered a bid
three wide to the stretch then gave out.
