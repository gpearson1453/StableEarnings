dug in gamely in the final furlong, drifted out some and held on determinedly to prevail. THREENINETYTWO tracked between rivals, moved up two wide on
the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch drive and dug in gamely outside to the finish. WENDIGO was outrun early, advanced on the far turn, came three
wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside and was along for the show spot. KORCZAK raced three wide early, settled off the pace, chased the leaders on the
far turn, came three wide into the lane and was outkicked. PRIZED WARRIOR tracked close up on the inside, chased on the far turn, lacked a rally and
weakened in the lane. JERSEY FRESH chased three wide and gave way. LODI raced four wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and gave way.
