Footnotes
HEART FULL OF SOUL broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin inside rivals racing into the turn, shifted off the inside racing into upper stretch
and kicked clear in the closing stages under some right handed pressure. TWICE SMITTEN, urged between foes from the outset prompting the pace into
the turn, pressed the pacesetter to upper stretch but proved no match late. SOME WOULD SAY bobbled slightly at the start, tracked off the first flight from
just out of striking distance racing to the turn, angled to the inside entering the lane and continued with a mild bid to edge a rival for a share.
DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER, urged three wide prompting the pace to the turn, gave way into the lane. LA GLORIA, off last, was caught five wide tracking the
leaders out of striking distance in early stages and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
TEE EM EYE angled inwards while gaining terms with the leaders in the opening stages, was eased off the leaders tracking those rivals in the three path
through the backstretch, commenced a steady advance in that path racing into the turn, took over racing past midstretch and went clear under firm left
handed pressure. BEST KEPT SECRET was hustled up the rail setting the pace on a narrow margin, dueled for command racing into the turn, couldn't
match the winner in the drive but proved best of the others. JANET'S MAE, a bit outpaced in the opening stages, angled to the rail racing through the
backstretch, was being prompted to advance in tandem with the eventual winner, saved ground to upper stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a
share. ARI GIA, forwardly placed in the opening stages, was urged to terms with the pacesetter pressing the issue into the turn, dueled into upper stretch
and gave out nearing midstretch. MIDNIGHT EMMA stumbled at the start, switched outside foes early but failed to mount a serious challenge.

Footnotes
EL TIZAR broke inwards, was quickly righted, then sped clear of the field while angling over racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a clear margin into
the backstretch, held sway maintaining that margin into the lane and was kept to firm right handed pressure in the closing stages to maintain a safe
advantage. JACKS OUTLAW broke outwards, was rated off the second flight while shifting inwards a bit nearing the first turn, continued unhurried to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance three wide racing into the far turn and continued to make steady progress in that path to edge a rival for the place
honors nearing the wire while moving to close the gap. NORTHCUT, reserved last near the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out approaching the far
turn to gain position between foes on the second bend, angled back to the inside racing through the stretch and continued with interest while missing for
second. CAMPAIGN SPY, caught three deep in second flight racing to the first turn, continued outside a rival tracking the leader into the backstretch, was
prompted to close the gap nearing the far turn but had no closing bid. MARVELOUS THUNDER tracked the pace between foes, then along the inside as
part of the second flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded racing into the far turn. HAPPY HOUR COWBOY was rated inside foes in the second
flight, dropped back from that position on the first turn, switched out after a half while being prompted to advance but lacked a rally.

HONEY'S SOX APPEAL was prompted to gain a contending position in the opening stages, tracked just off the pacesetter inside a rival racing to the
backstretch, switched off the inside nearing the far turn while being urged to terms with the leader, pressed the issue on the far turn, was urged clear in late
stages and just lasted under firm handling. TIZ LITTLE BULL, reserved off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance three wide on the far turn into the lane and surged to challenge the winner nearing the wire to just miss. BEACH FLOWER tracked the pacesetter
outside a rival in second flight to the backstretch, conceded some position under patient handling racing to the far turn, was prompted to advance between
foes racing into the lane and found her best response in the closing stages to challenge between foes while being just outnodded by the top pair. MISS
PERFECTA sped to the lead while angling inwards racing to the first turn, dictated the pace to the far turn, briefly resisted the winner's challenge nearing the
lane but gave way late. GLAMORIZED settled off the second flight along the inside, was prompted to advance racing into the far turn but had no rally.

Footnotes
STRONG RULES broke readily, angled inwards forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, then edged clear into the lane and widened late under
brisk handling. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing into the turn, shifted three wide racing into the lane and proved best of the
others. DIABLO CUERNO angled to the inside in the opening stages tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, saved ground on the bend, then
shifted off the inside entering the lane to improve position between rivals late while prevailing for a share. BIG BUFFY broke sharply, angled to the inside
disputing the pace into the turn, couldn't match the winner entering the stretch and gave way late. TONY'S TAPIT swerved in at the start, then was taken up
while his rider corrected his course, switched outside foes racing just off the second flight into the turn but lacked the needed late response. CHATTER
BOX, slow to gather stride, dropped out early.

Footnotes
PAPA MAMBO threw her head at the start to drop off the first flight in the opening stages, tracked the leaders along the rail from out of striking distance
through the backstretch, made steady progress to advance inside foes wresting the advantage racing into upper stretch and made the balance of the pace
under pressure. DISTINCT APPROVAL tracked off the first flight racing four wide through the backstretch, steadily drew into contention in that path on the
turn, was floated out five wide entering the lane but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. FLAN, forwardly placed three deep stalking a
rival's pace in early stages, pressed the issue in that path on the turn to strike the front in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. PASZ THE
PEPPER, urged between foes prompting the pacesetter into the turn, lost some ground to the leaders nearing upper stretch, shifted out four wide entering
the lane crossing into the path of DISTINCT APPROVAL and quickly came up empty. REMARKABLE CHARM settled last racing to the turn and failed to
menace. WRAP IT UP, urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail in early stages, dueled inside rivals racing into the turn and gave out between foes entering
upper stretch.

CLEAR THE MINE gained a position just off the first flight racing outside a rival under light rating in the opening quarter, shifted three deep after a half
steadily gaining terms with the leaders, moved to challenge for command in that path racing into upper stretch, then took over and edged clear under firm
encouragement. DOMIKATE, reserved last to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to prevail
for the place honors in time. NOBLE EGYPTIAN, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace in the opening stages, pressed the issue between foes into the far
turn, dueled into upper stretch and weakened late. TAPSOLUTE settled off the second flight near the inside early, shifted out racing into upper stretch, then
split rivals just off the inside to gain some position in the closing stages. GLACKEN'S GHOST angled to the rail in early stages tracking off the first flight to
the backstretch, shifted out nearing the lane but lacked the needed late bid. BOBBY BABY switched out three wide early tracking just off the second flight
and steadily faded racing into the far turn. ALL UNDER CONTROL, urged to the lead along the rail racing to the first turn, pressed the issue inside foes into
the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
KENNEDY'S DAY tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the bend, shifted out splitting foes racing through the turn to wrest the advantage
entering upper stretch and went clear under pressure. WARREN'S WISH broke readily, angled to the inside setting the pace on a narrow margin into the
turn, proved no match when confronted by the winner but proved best of the others. STING BEE shifted inwards exchanging solid contact with ADDY
PADDY in the opening stages, angled to the rail to track off the second flight racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and gained some position
inside foes while prevailing for a share. RIVER SWAN settled outside foes in early stages, split foes three wide racing into the lane and continued to improve
position to the end. MARLEY BE GOOD angled inwards to track the leaders between foes racing into the lane but lacked the needed late response. B L
BREEZY tracked the leaders three wide between foes as part of the second flight racing into the turn and emptied out into the lane. TOP SHELF SARA
tracked just off the second flight racing four wide through the backstretch, angled out five wide nearing the lane and steadily faded. MZ JACKIE, bumped at
the start, settled along the inside early and failed to menace. ADDY PADDY exchanged bumps in early stages while being steadied out of tight quarters and
soon dropped out. BLUE MOON BELLE, urged to a forward placing outside the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, continued three deep on the turn
and gave way nearing the lane. PILOTS STAR broke inwards bumping MZ JACKIE and dropped out early.

Footnotes
TRUE WEST was rated tracking off the first flight four wide between foes through the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path leaving the midway
point of the turn, then wrested the advantage in the closing stages under firm left handed pressure. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE, unhurried three deep between
foes racing behind the first flight in the opening three furlongs, shifted out on the turn, angled five wide racing past midstretch and edged rivals for the place
honors. VOW OF FRANCIS, prominent four wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards racing into the turn disputing the pace between foes, contested the
issue inside foes into the lane but weakened late. MASTERFUL STRIDE, reserved in early stages, switched out five wide after the opening furlong while
being prompted to advance, advanced four wide on the turn to challenged for command, continued three deep between foes into the lane but proved empty
in late stages. LUCKYNSUCCESSFUL was hustled up the rail in early stages, then was eased back to track off the first flight and lacked a rally.
CHOCOLOGIST, in touch with the first flight three wide between in the opening stages, steadily faded into the turn. I'M AN EIGHT angled to the inside early
tracking off the first flight and steadily retreated into the lane. FAMILY CODE, urged between foes, then along the inside disputing the pace through the
backstretch into the turn, emptied out early.
