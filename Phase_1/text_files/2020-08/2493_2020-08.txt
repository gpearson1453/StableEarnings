Footnotes
ALBERT'S BARN chased the pace early, rallied entering the turn in the four path, continued to advance to a pair of dueling leaders and passed them readily
in upper stretch to clear off. MONTMARTRE took on the leader from outside on the turn, battled down the stretch, was no match for the winner but ran on
clear for place as second best. HOPPER FILL showed speed inside early, was hooked by a foe while inside on the turn, kept the rail down the stretch and
weakened at the eighth pole to settle for show. MY PAL DAL veered in at the start, chased from off the pace, saved ground on the turn, shifted out for room
in upper stretch and passed a fader late. DERBY CITY vied briefly, backed off the lead entering the turn, was urged there and lacked the needed rally in the
stretch.

Footnotes
POSITIVE VIBES was well back early, steadily advanced to close the gap on the first fight up the backstretch, shifted outside entering the turn, rallied to
take over, got a clear lead by mid turn, and was never challenged after that. STORMY MEMO tracked from third, moved up to vie with the leader on the
turn, got clear of that one but was no match for the rallying winner and second best. MALICED reared at the start, lost lengths, made a steady advance to
get close by the far turn, took the three path and vied with a foe for the show spot down the stretch. REWARDED tracked behind the leader, got into a battle
for show down the lane and settled for fourth. PORTRAIT OF EMMA was in the back early and improved position in the stretch. BLUEGRASS JUSTICE
was reserved mid field, ran evenly and faded late. DESIREE vied as inside speed, saved ground on the turn and came up empty in the stretch.

ARTEGON sped to a clear lead early, turned away a challenger in the stretch, weakened in the final yards and barely kept the win. FISH TRAPPE ROAD
was off the pace, urged while off the rail on the turn, kept on gaining down the stretch and nearly caught a weakening leader in the final yards. BIG AL
chased the leader early, got closer on the turn, was turned back attempting to challenge in the stretch, ran on and nearly got the place while closing in on a
weakening leader but was bested by another closer and settled for show.. STAY IN YO LANE chased from the inside, was urged on the turn and while
gaining, did not have enough run in the stretch. CHAMPAGNE PAPI was urged away from the gate, came very wide into the stretch and had a mild rally.
GET TOUGH was not a threat.

HAT IN THE RING stalked inside, split horses from off the rail on fhe turn, led at the three sixteenths pole and cleared off. SEVENTYSEVENWILOW was off
the pace, raced out in the middle of the backstretch, rallied in the five path entering the turn, had pace down the stretch but was no match for the winner,
and second best. LET'S RIDE chased the pace, dropped back on the turn, regained momentum to get closer while widest in the stretch and kept on for third
while no match for the top two. HUGH B. vied outside and faded in the final furlong. JOHN PAUL JONES raced within range of the contenders early but
faded in the last furlong. GREAT HARBOUR CAY was off last, ran up to vie inside for the lead and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
FLASHY KING GEORGE was reluctant to load then off a beat slow, secured good position to far turn,swooped around field to go clear past the quarter pole
and stretch, lasted in the final forty yards to the wire. BLANDA unhurried to far turn, rallied well in the stretch while coming on late. OHIO MUNNY pressured
pace between horses, hard used in the stretch run to secure show spot. STREAKY on rail to far turn,came out past the quarter pole to cut into the margin
through the the final sixteenth. COREY'S CATCH quick inside speed to the half but faded back readily from turn. DIAL MR PROSPECTOR chased pace to
the half and gave way quickly. R HOUDINI broke well but could not keep up and dropped far back. MAC LARNED broke slow and never factored. Due to a
timer malfunction the splits were unavailable and final was hand timed.

NOD TO PERSIA sat off a long leader, rallied in the three path on the far turn and led, clearing off at the top of the stretch. ENHANCED EDITION lost
lenghts shortly after the start, steadily advanced to get near the leaders, quickened on the far turn and improved down the stretch. ALLEN was bumped at
the start, sat behind a clear leader, dropped back, came very wide into the stretch and passed a tired foe late to get the show. POINT TO DUNKIRK tracked
a long lead, contended to the final furlong and tired. SNORING BARTH stayed well back, had some rally on the far turn and was even for the rest.
TRAMORE BAY stalked from inside and faded on the turn. HERE COMES TREY held a very wide lead to the turn, was caught and passed mid turn and
tired. PENTHOUSE KITTEN was bumped at the start and no threat.

Footnotes
PSYCHOANALYST was never far back, ranged up four wide on the turn, led in upper stretch and was nearly caught in the final yards. QUEEN CITY KITTY
rallied from the back in the four path on the turn, steadily advanced down the stretch and just missed the win. MY PINK BABY BIRD was off the pace,
moved up on the turn while in the two path and ran on just enough to gain the show. NUTNBUTAROXSTAR came from off the pace, quickened five wide on
the turn and flattened out in upper stretch while still improving position. MISS TREATED STAR vied early and lacked the needed kick in the stretch. IT WILL
HAPPEN vied on the turn and tired in late stretch. KAYLEE'S HOPE was bumped between horses at the start and no factor. GINGERMYSISTER came out
fast, lost position well before the turn and steadily faded down the stretch. VAQUERITA contended for a quarter and faded while inside on the turn.
