Footnotes
CANDY CREW was outrun to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, swung out for room and crowded RED STAR briefly, was responding then had the rider
drop his whip in mid stretch but continued on gamely to get there. KLAY NATION tracked the leaders four wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid
stretch then could not hold off the winner. RED STAR had no speed, raced three then four wide to the stretch, shifted out but had to check when the winner
took his path then had a mild late bid. BERNARDOS HIDEAWAY was chasing to the turn, was two wide then eased in to the rail into the stretch but lacked
the needed late response. BADGER contested the pace from the rail to the stretch, got passed by KLAY NATION in mid stretch and weakened. WINTER
FOG attended the pace outside of BADGER and two wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and tired. STARTENDER chased the leaders two
wide to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
PRORIKA had the best speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded despite drifting out and held driving. REGAL LADY had no speed,
eased out three wide for room mid turn then shifted out into the stretch and closed steadily for the place. WICKED SUNSET stalked the pace two wide to the
stretch then finished willingly inside but lost second. COLONEL DEERING was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, angled out in upper
stretch and finished in a mild rally. CEDARS OF LEBANON (IRE) chased the pace to the turn, was three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch
and weakened. THE PET pressed the winner two wide to the stretch but gave way in the drive. LACEY'S RAINBOW stumbled at the start and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
GOING TO SHABOOMS never far back to the second turn, rallied two wide to get on terms into the stretch, inched away to mid stretch then stubbornly held
NOVELLA safe. NOVELLA was five wide pressing TINK'S TWIRL to the backstretch, was fanned five wide on the second turn and lost some ground but
finished gamely for second. SPLASHING trailed to the second turn, came four wide to the stretch then was making up ground belatedly. TINK'S TWIRL
drifted out while showing speed and was four wide to the backstretch, set the pace well off the rail to the second turn, remained four wide to the stretch but
weakened in then drive. HAL'S BUDDY settled mid pack to the turn then saved ground to no avail. GRATZIE (GB) was outrun to the turn, raced three wide
to mid turn, swung out to the five path into the stretch but lacked a closing response. NORTHERN ROSE was also mid pack early, had to check in traffic
from the half mile pole to the three eighths, raced two wide to the stretch and also did not rally. ARIES stalked the pace to the turn, made a bid three wide to
the stretch then tired.

EMMA'S DANCE broke alertly in her bow, set the pace off the rail to the stretch then kicked away to mid stretch and was under steady urging to the line.
SILVER LYRIC chased the winner early, got outkicked two wide to the stretch then finished willingly for second. SILK ROAD SALLY had no speed then
circled four wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. WINNING APPEAL was outsprinted to the turn then saved ground to no avail. REINA DE
REYES pressed the winner three wide to the stretch, lugged inward sharply in mid stretch and cut off MOMMA MOCCA, took up to straighten out and
weakened. MOMMA MOCCA had no speed, came two wide to the stretch, eased out in upper stretch then tried to split rivals nearing the furlong marker but
was cut off by REINA DE REYES, steadied and weakened. LAWYER PROOF pressed the pace to the turn, was caught four wide to the stretch then tired.
LADY SKYWALKER was chasing early, got outkicked on the turn and gave way in the stretch. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run
involving REINA DE REYES and MOMMA MOCCA and disqualified REINA DE REYES from fifth to sixth for interference.

Footnotes
SLOANE GARDEN (GB) raced unhurried for a half mile, bid three then four wide on the second turn, rallied in the drive and was along in time. ZIARAH
(IRE) never far back to the second turn, shifted out three wide to the stretch, rallied to collar the leaders in deep stretch then could not stall her stablemate.
HEATHERS GREY was on the pace from the outset, saved ground to the stretch, stayed determinedly to mid stretch but was weakening late. MEAL
TICKET was allowed to settle for a half mile, raced three wide on the second turn but lacked the needed late response. MYBLUEBELL (FR) attended the
pace outside of HEATHERS GREY, raced two wide and stubbornly stayed on to mid stretch then tired. AUGURE hopped at the start and was never a
threat. WICKED OLD FASHION stalked the leaders to the second turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
POUR ON THE COLE was unhurried to the second turn, advanced two wide to the stretch, rallied when set down for the drive and finished steadily to win
going away. DARKHAWK settled mid pack to the second turn, saved ground and rallied to the stretch, dueled to mid stretch then could not stall the winner
while besting CAPE POINT for second. CAPE POINT set the pace to the second turn, responded to mid stretch then was outfinished for the win and lost
second late. SWIFT CHANNEL settled mid pack to the second turn then saved ground to no avail. GOLD N GRAND had no speed, settled to the half, was
two wide to the stretch but was never a threat. PEACE IN THE EAST had no speed and was not a factor. HEAVENLY TIGER broke awkwardly, threw his
head, had no speed and was always outrun. PREMIER LEAGUE pressed the pace for five furlongs then gave way. INTRINSIC VALUE was chasing for a
half mile, saved ground on the second turn but tired in the stretch. LONO also chased the leader from the rail to the second turn then gave way in the drive,
pulled up near the gap on the first turn, was unsaddled there and walked off.
