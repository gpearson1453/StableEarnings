Footnotes
MACHO MANIA sped clear on the early pace building a big lead on the backside, took a breathers as rivals drew closer on the far turn then re engaged
finding more to open up at the head of the lane winning as much the best. JUST A LIL LUKEY went evenly off a loose leader through the backside drawing
close on the far turn, no match for winner down the lane dueled abreast rival in the two path saving place. LIL PISTOLA saved ground rallying in upper
stretch finishing well along the rail. JANGADA gave a mild middle move chasing on the far turn losing momentum in upper stretch finishing evenly near mid
track. JAIL TIME staled a loose leader closing in on the far turn, wavered in upper stretch fading with little left. JERZEES ONE gave a five wide middle move
then wilted into upper stretch. DON CURLIONE showed little. BULL BAILEY played no factor.
