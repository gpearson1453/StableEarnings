Footnotes
MOON OVER MONTANA broke sharply and led the field while saving ground around the first turn, maintained a narrow advantage on the inside up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and dueled the length of the stretch, gamely refusing to be passed and holding out for the win.
SILVER QUARTERS raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the second turn still
in the two path, moved up to challenge approaching the quarter pole, dueled down the lane and had to settle for second best. PICKFORD raced off the pace
in the two path through the opening half mile, angled in to save ground around the far turn, and improved position mildly while drifting out in the stretch.
CONATIVE trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, swung out to launch a wide bid passing the three eighths pole,
entered the stretch from the four path and proved to be no match for the top three from there. J W RUCKUS raced in the three path around the first turn,
moved up the press the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the second turn and continued to
tire in the stretch. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS raced in the four path around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the
far turn from the three path and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
SEQUINS STORM was sent for speed up the inside, dictated terms while saving ground on the turn, went to a drive past the three sixteenths, and always
held clear. FREAKIN JOE tracked the pace inside of MAGI early, continued to stalk in the three path on the turn, went to a drive approaching the furlong
pole, could not get to SEQUINS STORM but chased on a clear second best. MAGI was reluctant to load, tracked the pace outside of FREAKIN JOE early,
was pushed along while tracking the leading pair in the four to five path on the turn, continued to chase them two wide in the lane, and took closer order late
while under a drive. RED PRINCE broke out and bumped CRANKSHAFT in the opening strides, settled toward the rear well behind the main group, was
pushed along while saving ground through the bend, and improved position inside while under a drive. TSALI chased the leading trio, was pushed along in
the two path on the turn, came into the lane under a drive inside, but flattened out. CRANKSHAFT was bumped between RED PRINCE and PRUDENT
HERO in the opening strides, chased at the rear of the main pack, bid in the five path on the turn, but emptied out in the lane. PRUDENT HERO broke
inward bumping CRANKSHAFT in the opening strides, settled at the rear, trailed while being driven in the four path on the turn, and did not respond with a
bid under continued urging in the lane.

Footnotes
MEEKA bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced between horses in the middle of the pack early, navigated the turn from the three path,
forged to the lead at the eighth pole and just held off a late rush from POINT STREAK to keep the win. POINT STREAK bumped with the horse to her
outside and then the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to race just off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, ran into traffic near the quarter
pole while running in the two path, eventually found racing room in midstretch and was gaining late on the inside at the wire, just missing the win. GHAALEB
THE GREAT trailed the field through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the turn, swung out entering the stretch and was gaining ground
rapidly on the outside in late stretch. LOOKTHEOTHERWAY raced on the outside in the middle of the pack early, began a wide bid approaching the three
eighths pole, entered the stretch from the four path and raced evenly down the lane, but was outfinished late. TIZ HOPPIN dueled for the lead on the inside
up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, continued to duel in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. LESLEY'S SONG bumped with the
horse to her outside leaving the gate, moved up to duel for the lead on the outside through the opening three eighths of a mile, navigated the turn from the
two path and faded in the stretch. FIFTHATNARRAGANSET raced between horses in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, began to drop back while
racing in the three path around the turn and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
TRUE LOYALTY settled at the rear, was taken out to rally three wide between horses on the far turn, went to a drive approaching the quarter pole, rallied
well four wide in the lane, led at the sixteenth mark and drove clear. HALF OF MANHATTAN tracked the leading pair, encroached on them three wide on
the far turn, continued three wide with the leading flight into the lane, was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth but kept on well for place. CADET
CAPTAIN set the pace inside, took increasing pressure from MOONLIGHT MISCHIEF down the backstretch, vied inside of that foe through the turn and into
the lane, weakened past the furlong mark but was just game enough to salvage the show. MOONLIGHT MISCHIEF attended the pace outside of CADET
CAPTAIN through the clubhouse turn, pressured him more down the backstretch, vied outside him through the far turn, came into the lane under a drive
between that foe and the looming HALF OF MANHATTAN, weakened past the furlong mark and could not hold show. GLIDING ALONE raced at the inside
of the chasing flight, continued inside near the rear through the far turn and into the lane, chased on mildly between horses three wide in the final furlong but
could not quite catch the weakening leaders. ALLEGIANCE raced between horses in the chasing flight through the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch,
raced between horses two wide in the rear group through the far turn and into the lane, kept on mildly four wide late but lacked the needed kick.
DRAGUNOV raced three wide in the chasing flight through the first turn and into the backstretch, was pushed along three wide near the rear into the far
turn, was urged four wide around that bend, weakened four wide into the lane and was empty thereafter.

Footnotes
QUICK TEMPO dueled for the lead on the inside early, forged ahead while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch, and needed
only one tap of the crop in the final furlong to maintain the victory. MKAR THE FAST veered in hard and bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the
gate, chased the frontrunners up the backstretch and into the turn, entered the stretch in the two path, drifted in in upper stretch and then gained ground
quickly in the final furlong. BRAVO BRAVO was bumped by the horse to his outside leaving the gate, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn and was not a threat to the top two. WISE KHOZAN was away from the gate slowly, trailed the field on the outside early, raced wide
around the turn, entered the stretch in the four path and was not a factor. TIGHTROPE dueled for the lead on the outside early, began to drop back from the
two path around the turn, and continued to tire in the stretch. PER VIDEO REVIEW, TIMES WERE CORRECTED.

Footnotes
BACKSIDE BEAUTY made the lead, took pressure from PALACE DUCHESS into the turn while that pair cleared off from the rest of the pack, vied inside of
PALACE DUCHESS around the bend, edged clear of that foe when asked into the lane, kept on under a drive and held safe. RANK AND FILE tracked the
leading pair outside of CREAL DREAMER, rallied three wide in the lane under a drive, and gained to the wire while running out of room to catch the leader.
CREAL DREAMER tracked the leading pair inside of RANK AND FILE, went to a drive inside foes in upper stretch, rallied inside foes but was outfinished for
the place. PALACE DUCHESS pressed the early pace outside of BACKSIDE BEAUTY, cleared off from the rest while vying outside that foe into the turn,
proved no match for BACKSIDE BEAUTY into the stretch, and weakened between horses into the final furlong. TANGO CITY chased inside of BEZEL SET
early, continued to chase in the three to four path on the turn, raced three wide into the lane, took closer order in the final furlong but lacked enough kick to
improve position. APRIL'S GEM came in and bumped TWELVE RED ROSES in the opening jumps and then was awkward into stride, settled between
horses in the rear flight around the bend and into the lane, took mildly closer order late but ultimately proved no threat. BEZEL SET chased outside of
TANGO CITY early but settled back toward the rear into the turn, raced at the inside of the rear group around the bend, was urged into the lane and driven
midstretch, but proved empty. TWELVE RED ROSES took back when bumped by APRIL'S GEM in the opening strides, settled at the rear, raced three wide
in the rear group around the turn and into the lane, went to a drive in upper stretch but came up empty.

GOLD HAWK raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground around the far turn,
launched a bid between horses passing the five sixteenths pole, took over the lead from the rail in upper stretch and pulled away while drifting out in the final
furlong. BEHIND ENEMY LINES saved ground while well off the pace around the first turn, began to improve position up the backstretch, navigated the far
turn from the three path, began a wide bid near the quarter pole and chased the winner home on the outside, proving to be the best of the rest. PISTOL
BOX trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in slightly to run in the two path around the far turn and gained
ground quickly on the outside in late stretch. MIRACLE MOUNTAIN chased the leaders from the three path through the opening half mile, raced in the two
path around the turn, put in a mild bid near the five sixteenths pole and finished evenly while drifting out in the stretch. DREAMING OF FRANK raced in the
two path around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, led the field from the two path around the far turn and into the stretch,
and weakened in the final furlong. AHOYMYCAPTAIN raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch towards the back of the pack
on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path and made no bid in the stretch. ZANFORCE saved ground around the first turn, dueled for the lead
on the inside through the next quarter of a mile, began to drop back while racing around the far turn and continued to fade in the stretch.
