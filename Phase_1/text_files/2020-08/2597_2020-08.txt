Footnotes
MY MORNING GAL shared the lead from outside, moved clear when allowed on the bend, was under a drive the last furlong and widened command. LT.
JUNIOR GRADE was hustled early to stay close, two wide through the turn then moved clear for second deep stretch. ABBMAR broke inward, raced in
contention toward the outside, was three then four wide taking the bend and caught THAT KHENNY for third late. THAT KHENNY forced in at the break,
disputed the pace inside MY MORNING GAL on the backstretch, did not keep up taking the turn and slowly wore down the last furlong. CRIMSON LUCK
chased just outside CHRISTY ATTACK and lacked a significant late bid. CHRISTY ATTACK failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. CAUSELUCK angled
in nearing the bend and had no stretch bid. KINGSBURRY ATTACK was squeezed back at the stat, stayed off the inside and showed little.

Footnotes
DAWN'S ROAD hesitated at the break, was rushed up to gain the lead midway on the backstretch, floated out some entering the stretch then lengthened his
lead under a drive. STOSH in midpack early, angled in with four furlongs to go, gradually progressed to midstretch, was no match for DAWN'S ROAD the
last eighth but was unchallenged for second. EUGENE chased from just off the inside, picked up his pace leaving the turn, moved to the rail inside the final
furlong, took over third and proved easily best of the rest. BONNIE DANCES soon trailed, began to progress along the rail on the bend, altered out three
wide to gain a clear path nearing the final sixteenth and improved position without threatening. JAXONS POINT chased from outside, was four wide taking
the turn and had no late bid. MIDNIGHT LEWIS pressed just outside DAWN'S ROAD for a half mile then began to tire between horses through the lane.
PUNCHNGO was prominent from outside on the backstretch but gave way three wide on the turn. WAVE THE GOLD unruly in the gate, stayed off the
inside throughout his race and showed little.

Footnotes
BIG BAD DOC settled, gradually progressed two wide, bumped with CHEYENNE VIHO with a half mile to go, engaged SQUIRRELY MIKE from outside into
the second turn, battled that one in the lane and shook free with a sixteenth left. THE DOGMEN was bumped then steadied back from crowding at the start,
settled outside, picked up his pace after a half mile, was four wide through the second turn, continued his bid in the stretch, was too late but caught
SQUIRRELY MIKE for second. SQUIRRELY MIKE shared the early lead in hand from inside, moved clear on the backstretch, was challenged nearing the
second turn, weaved some as he fought to hold on in the lane but began to wear down inside the final eighth. IWANT SGT RECKLESS bumped at the
break, moved up to contention from outside on the backstretch, jostled briefly with CHEYENNE VIHO with four furlongs to go, angled in some on the second
turn, took the rail leaving that bend and flattened out the last furlong. AMSALOR was away slowly, trailed from off the rail, came widest into the stretch and
improved position without threatening. NARRATION kept along or just off the rail, was never a threat. DROOP'S M D B broke outward, bumping IWANT
SGT RECKLESS, chased from outside, chased from off the inside, was three to five wide taking the second bend and had no late bid. CHEYENNE VIHO
broke outward, bumping solidly with THE DOGMEN, vied for the early lead outside SQUIRRELY MIKE, did not keep up on the backstretch, jostled with
IWANT SGT RECKLESS and BIG BAD DOC at the half mile pole, steadily retreated and was allowed to coast in the stretch.

Footnotes
MIZ BLUE broke in stride and sprinted away from the rest, rated through the bend, under a drive in the lane and held on. COUNTRY ASSETS raced in the
second flight toward the outside, was three wide taking the turn, rallied through the stretch, was too late but caught TRIPLE SCOUT for second eighty yards
out. TRIPLE SCOUT forwardly placed between horses, was just off the inside through the bend, lacked the extra kick needed in the stretch but proved
easily best of the others. KALISPELL chased from just off or along the rail, angled out widest upper stretch and had no late bid. WELL MAID chased from
inside, came off the rail some for the stretch run and also had no late bid. TRUE TO JEANINE was reluctant to load, saved ground taking the bend and was
empty for the drive.

Footnotes
EADS BRIDGE soon moved clear and took the inside, was challenged midway on the backstretch, shook free inside the last furlong and held sway under a
steady drive. TOMASITA in contention between rivals from the beginning, advanced three wide on the bend, floated out some for the stretch run, closed
well, was too late but caught FOO FOO GIRL for second in the waning yards. FOO FOO GIRL was sent to dispute the pace outside EADS BRIDGE, fought
through the stretch but slowly wore down inside the last furlong. HIDDEN FIGURE moved to the inside midway on the backstretch, was boxed in through the
turn, gained a clear path along the rail the final furlong but lacked the needed late kick. LADY OF LAHTI chased from outside, was four to five wide taking
the bend and failed to have a significant stretch bid. MARGARITA ATTACK was steadied briefly when HIDDEN FIGURE took her path midway on the
backstretch and could only improve her position inside rivals the last quarter mile without threatening. HOLD THE SPENDING was prominent between
horses for five furlongs then began to yield. POSITIONEDTODANCE forwardly placed early, was steadied in traffic approaching the half mile marker, three
then four wide through the turn and flattened out for the drive. TEMPLESIS chased from outside, angled in on the bend, fanned back out for the stretch run
and had little to offer.

STALLONE broke on top and outward, bumping solidly with JUST RUN, was straightened, rated just outside GHAALEB'S MAGIC, went for the lead into the
bend, edged ahead upper stretch and held on under steady handling. GHAALEB'S MAGIC gained a clear lead with five furlongs to go, was challenged from
outside into the turn, never relented the last two furlongs but lacked the extra needed in the waning yards. JUST RUN was bumped solidly and forced into
CREAL WONDER at the break then steadied back, progressed from inside, angled out some through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and found
best stride too late. CREAL WONDER bumped at the start, raced in contention from outside, was three wide taking the turn, floated out some entering the
lane and gradually yielded. D' YANK chased from just off the inside, fanned out behind JUST RUN for the drive and had no late bid. UNCLE PADDY moved
to the outside early on and showed little.

Footnotes
SIMPLY FAST gradually angled out while being rated on the backstretch, commenced her bid four wide on the turn, was forced out to path six entering the
lane, took over upper stretch while under a brief drive then steadily opened up the last furlong and proved much the best while ridden out. PRINCESS
MANDII prominent toward the outside, moved clear for second from path three on the bend, was carried out by RUNNING SCARED as he went for the lead
into the lane, lugged in some under right-handed pressure once straightened for the drive, proved no match for SIMPLY FAST the final eighth but was
unchallenged for second. MAGNITUDE TEN without early speed, advanced four wide on the turn, fanned out behind SIMPLY FAST into the stretch, had a
striking position with a furlong to go but could only move clear for third inside that last eighth. UNEEKY in contention on the backstretch, did not stay close
three wide on the turn, angled outside RUNNING SCARED upper stretch and leveled off. SKIPTOTHEWIRE hesitated at the break, was just off the inside
on the bend, angled to the outside at the top of the lane and failed to have a significant stretch bid. B REWARDING was well placed from inside on the turn
but began to steadily yield with three furlongs left. RUNNING SCARED was quickly clear after the start, just off the rail on the bend, drifted out and began to
fade leaving the turn, was forced in some to stay clear of PRINCESS MANDII and continued to give way between rivals. CHRISTMAS PICKLES somewhat
reluctant to load, gave way widest on the turn. FAST NANCY also hesitated at the start then showed little in a ground-saving trip. GLORY BEYOND REACH
unresponsive to early urging, quickly faded from between horses, was pulled up on the turn and vanned off.
