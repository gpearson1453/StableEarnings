Footnotes
MISS ALEGRIA well placed behind the speedy trio, took the turn three wide, steered out a path entering the stretch, grabbed the lead mid stretch and drove
clear. SAVING SOPHIE traveled at the back of the field, five wide around the turn, closed through the lane and was clearly second best. QUEEN
STORMBORN broke in and bumped rival at the start, vied three deep up into and around the turn, cleared leaving the bend, could not offer resistance to the
winner and flattened in the final sixteenth. KATSAROS tracked off the inside, four wide into the turn then moved into the three path, came out in the stretch
and showed a mild response to earn a minor award. LADY ON ICE angled to the inside, traveled near the fence into the turn, moved off the inside and
entered the stretch three wide but lacked the needed rally. KAELY'S CANDY pinballed at the start but recovered quickly to vie for the lead between rivals,
contested the pace to the quarter pole then gave way in the lane. TIZ A UNICORN tracked outside a rival, raced two wide then angled to the rail near the
quarter pole and never made an impact. QUIET SECRETARY bumped and steadied early, chased a bit off the rail into the turn then came out and was
never a factor. CALIFORNIA COOL vie for command from inside to the quarter pole, outpaced entering the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
AWESOME SCORE stalked inside, challenged into the lane, brushed with CANDY SHOPPER in upper stretch, dueled through the final furlong and proved
best. CANDY SHOPPER stalked outside a rival, bid alongside the leader at the quarter pole and gained command, brushed with AWESOME SCORE in
upper stretch, battled down the lane and got outkicked. COLT FICTION broke out and bumped rival, tracked in the two path then came out on the turn and
five wide into the stretch, close outside the top pair and finished a game third. FULL DRAW off a bit slow to begin, mid-pack in the early going, went four
wide into the turn, six wide leaving the bend and went evenly through the final furlong. LUCKY RYAN SEVEN off slow and bumped by inside rival at the
start, traveled along the inside, came out on the turn and never threatened. HOOP DREAM chased a bit off the rail through the turn and was never a factor.
PAPA'S HONEY steadied off heels at the nine-sixteenths marker, went three to four wide around the bend and lacked a response to urging. BABAEL
stalked outside a rival, steadied between at the quarter pole, altered out around rival who was pulling up into the stretch and faded in the drive. VETERAN
sped clear to set the pace, showed the way through the turn, challenged at the quarter pole, pulled up into the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
MADAME BARBARIAN reserved from the inside, saved ground through the bend, moved out into the two path entering the stretch, steered out in upper
stretch, closed fast and nailed the runner-up in the closing moments. UNO TROUBLE MAKER dueled from the inside, kicked clear at the three-sixteenths,
inched away then nailed at the wire. CROWN KITTEN off the rail in the beginning then angled in nearing the turn, went two wide to three wide around the
bend, finished willingly and outfinished BUSY PAYNTER for the show. BUSY PAYNTER dueled outside of UNO TROUBLE MAKER, could not match strides
with that rival into the lane, kept on and was edged for third. SWEET RAFAELA three deep into the turn, angled five wide around STURDY ONE on the turn,
moved back into the three path and never threatened. TWIRLING DEVON lost footing and to be away a slowly, trailed the field to the turn, went four wide
around the bend and proved no menace. TINSEL TOWN QUEEN chased outside a rival, between into the turn, steadied past the three-eighths behind
STURDY ONE who was being pulled up, came two wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. STURDY ONE stalked the top pair, took a bad step
and pulled up at the three-eighths, eased into the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
SOLITAIRE steadied briefly early, settled outside a rival then off the rail, advanced three to four wide around the turn, took control past the eighth pole and
held off a pair of late challengers. GOODTINGSCOMINPINK settled inside, lacked room into the second turn, kept inside to the stretch, came out in the
stretch, shifted out and bumped rival late, rallied but was too late. ZUCCHERA unhurried through the early stages, advanced off the rail into and around the
far turn, rallied from the outside in the lane, bumped by the GOODTINGSCOMINPINK late and kept on gamely three deep to the line. LAVENDER (IRE)
stalked outside a rival or two wide, ridden along on the far turn, traveled two wide into the stretch, shifted in and bumped foe at the sixteenth pole and kept
on willingly to the wire. FREEDOM LASS four deep early then stalked off the rail, bid three deep near the five sixteenths, took a short lead in the stretch but
faltered in the late stages. MELA JONES well placed from the inside, steered out in the stretch and never rallied. DANCEFORMUNNY forwardly placed
outside the leader, bid between rivals at the five-sixteenths, bumped by LAVENDER near the sixteenth pole and flattened. QUEENSBECCAANDJANE took
control early, set the pace up the backstretch, vied inside into the stretch and gave way. Y NOT SIZZLE settled inside, came out into the lane and proved no
menace. BLAZING CHARM traveled off the pace while outside a rival, went between runners into the far turn, exited the bend three wide and never
threatened. THERE WAS A DOUBLE DISQUALIFICATION IN RACE SEVEN. FIRST, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED GOODTINGSCOMINPINK FROM
SECOND TO THIRD FOR SHIFTING OUT AND CAUSING INTERFERENCE TO ZUCCHERA LATE IN THE RACE. THE STEWARDS THEN
DISQUALIFIED LAVENDER FROM FOURTH TO SEVENTH SHIFTING IN AND CAUSING INTERFERENCE TO DANCEFORMUNNY AT THE
SIXTEENTH POLE. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MY GIRL RED set the pace with SCATERRA to the outside, kicked clear around the turn, urged once left-handed in the lane and drew off under strong
handling. GET ON THE BUS well placed just off the leader inside, saved ground into the lane, raced a bit green in the stretch but finished well to prove
second best. EXCHANGE VOWS went three wide into the turn, moved into the two path, came out in the stretch and bested the rest. SCAT'S CHOICE
away quickest from the outside, dropped back to chase off the rail, went four wide into the turn, three wide leaving the bend, came out into the stretch and
lacked further response. SEPTEMBER SECRET stalked outside a rival, three wide around the turn, drifted out upper stretch under left-handed urging and
weakened in the final furlong. SCATERRA prompted the pace from the outside, could not match strides with the winner around the bend, drifted out into the
stretch and faded.

Footnotes
LEGGS GALORE set the pace outside under pressure, cleared rivals at the three-eighths, angled to the rail around the turn, cut the corner into the stretch
and held safely under right-handed urging. THAT'S AMARE angled to the rail early, steadied inside at the three-eighths, stayed inside then tipped out at the
top of the lane and finished well. LETS GET WILD bumped leaving the gate, forwardly placed inside, bumped with VA VA VOOM past the half-mile marker,
saved ground into the stretch and stayed on willingly for third. VA VA VOOM bumped by inside rival soon after the start, up close between runners early,
steadied and bumped past the half-mile pole, traveled outside a rival on the turn then failed to rally when called upon. KETCHUP settled inside, swung out
into the lane and never threatened. MISS CAROUSEL up close between runners, crowded and steadied early, chased three wide around the turn and
weakened. BIG MINX broke in and bumped rival then shifted out and bumped outside foe leaving the gate, went three wide into the stretch and was never a
factor.
