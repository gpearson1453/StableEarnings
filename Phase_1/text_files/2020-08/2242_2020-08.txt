Footnotes
ACCOLADES GALORE broke in front, set all the pace under pressure, drifted out under a left handed whip brushing the runner up in upper stretch, dug in
gamely under a right handed urging and proved best under strong handling. DREAM ON JILLY chased the pace along the inside for six furlongs, angled two
wide when set down passing the quarter pole, drew outside the winner entering the stretch, drifted in a bit brushing with that one, matched strides to the wire
and just missed. PEGGY'S COVE close up, lacked the needed response. SQUATCHINGWITHLYSS was fractious in the gate prior to the start then no
threat. IMMACULATE HEART pressured the winner two wide into the far turn then gave way. MISS D IRISH was hung four wide into the firs turn, had speed
for a half, stopped and was eased to the wire. THE RIDER OF DREAM ON JILLY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF ACCOLADES
GALORE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
