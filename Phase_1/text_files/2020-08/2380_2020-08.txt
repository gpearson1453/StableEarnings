GRAND PRIZE broke readily, tracked just off the first flight near the inside racing to the turn, was prompted to advance while shifting out three wide nearing
upper stretch, split rivals in that path entering the lane challenging for command and gained a narrow advantage to prevail under pressure. DIVA DE KELA
broke sharply, settled last off the second flight in early stages, was prompted to gain contention four wide on the turn, was fanned five wide racing into the
lane advancing in tandem with several rivals and prevailed for the place honors while failing to match the winner. SANDY SANGRIA tracked off the first flight
outside a rival in the opening quarter, was prompted to advance between foes while being fanned four wide entering the lane but was outkicked by the top
pair. JOY IN THE JOURNEY, urged between rivals prompting the pace, pressed the issue outside a rival, then between foes into the stretch and was taken
up while fading in late stages. FORTY NINE MODEL, urged inside foes setting the pace on a narrow advantage, dueled for command through the turn and
gave way into upper stretch.

TUT'S REVENGE broke readily, gained terms with the pacesetter stalking that rival under light reserve, pressed the issue between foes, then inside a rival
racing into the far turn, then kicked clear into the lane under right handed pressure. GIANT PAYDAY tracked just off the first flight near the inside racing into
the first turn, shifted out three wide after a half while being prompted to terms with the leaders, pressed the issue outside the winner on the far turn to upper
stretch but proved no match late. TWOKO BAY was rated off the second flight outside a rival in the opening stages, worked his way to the inside nearing the
far turn, then split foes just off the inside to close the gap inside the top pair. PRIMO TOUCH tracked off the first flight three wide in early stages, was caught
four wide midway through the backstretch, angled nearer to the inside on the far turn but steadily faded. ASTOUNDING settled inside rivals early, switched
out on the backstretch, swung out to the five path racing into the lane but had no rally. PROFESSIONAL, urged to the lead while angling to the inside,
dueled for command on the backstretch to the far turn and gave way.

BOLD PROPOSITION, off slowly, was urged between rivals to challenge for command in the opening quarter, shook clear racing into the turn, shifted well
off the inside entering the lane and was kept to firm encouragement. TWIRLINCOTTONCANDY, in touch with the leaders in early stages, was eased off the
pace after the opening furlong, saved ground on the turn into the lane and finished with interest to edge a rival for the place honors. FILTHY FIVE, urged
between foes prompting the pace from the outset into the turn, couldn't maintain terms with the winner and faded into the stretch. RISKY SITUATION
tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn and offered no rally. JIMMY'S MARCO joined the pace outside foes in the opening stages,
continued in pursuit three deep to the bend and soon gave way.

DOUBLE BEE STING gained terms prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue on the far turn into the lane, drifted out midstretch but edged forward and
held BENTLEY'S DREAM under firm encouragement. The latter was urged to the lead inside foes dictating the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch,
dueled for command into the stretch, lost the advantage late but resisted the winner to the end. SHE B GLAMOROUS tracked off the first flight along the
inside, shifted out three wide in late stages and edged a rival for a share. MADISON'S QUARTERS, forwardly placed three wide in the opening stages,
eased back to track off the first flight outside a rival, shifted four wide in the lane but lacked the needed late kick. KIMBERLY FRANCES, off slowly, settled
near the inside and passed only tiring rivals. SWEET BLINDNESS tracked the leaders outside rivals just off the second flight but offered no rally. WILD
MUNNY settled near the inside early and failed to menace.

ELUSIVE AMELIA, urged inside rivals prompting the pace from the outset to the backstretch, shook clear racing into the far turn and held sway to the end
under pressure. INDAWIN angled to the inside early tracking off the first flight, saved ground into the lane and edged a rival for the place honors. CAUSIN
MISCHIEF, urged prompting the pace between foes from the outset into the backstretch, conceded some position after a half to track just off the pacesetter,
continued in pursuit of that foe into the far turn and faded into the lane. AND ISLES, in touch with the first flight three wide in early stages, was prompted in
that path to the far turn and gave way. LA VIDA balked momentarily in the post parade when entering the track prior to the race, tracked off the first flight
racing four wide to the backstretch and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
CARAMEL ANGEL, urged to the lead while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, turned back
several challengers racing into the far turn and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. MR. D'S LEGEND ducked out at the start bumping
MUSKYMAN, was righted to track off the first flight along the inside, steadily gained position racing into the far turn, shifted out entering the lane while being
urged to advance but proved only second best. MUSKYMAN, bumped at the start, then forced into SILVER DASH, was settled off the second flight along
the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position inside foes racing into the far turn, shifted out three wide nearing the lane and continued well
enough to prevail for a share. SILVER DASH, knocked back at the start, pulled his way between foes to gain a position just off the pacesetter after a half,
was prompted to lodge a brief bid racing into the far turn but soon flattened out. WALKERS MEMO, reserved while angling nearer to the inside early,
improved position between rivals into the lane. SAMMY'S NUGGET, urged between foes to gain a position in the second flight, was fanned three wide into
the backstretch and faded early. SLIM CHANCE, caught three, then four wide as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, dropped out early.
THREESIXTHREE, forwardly placed while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, switched outside the leader entering the backstretch while being
urged to close the gap, bolted entering the far turn, was soon outdistanced, then was collected with the assistance of the outrider to walk off the course
under his own power.

Footnotes
FOREIGN RUMOR broke readily, pressed the pace three wide through the backstretch, shifted inwards racing into the turn while moving to gain the
advantage, went clear midway through the bend and held sway to the end under firm left handed encouragement. RAJA'S APPEAL, in touch between foes
in the opening stages, was eased off the pace nearing the turn, shifted three wide entering the bend and steadily gained position between foes late. CIRCLE
ME BERT broke slowly, was prompted to advance while shifting out four wide racing into the turn and continued in that path to prevail for a share.
PHANTOM THREEONINE, reserved along the inside in early stages, gained momentum racing into the lane, was held up in traffic near midstretch, then
altered course four wide in the closing stages. WINTERS RUN broke awkwardly, then stumbled at the start and never gained contention. WILD DESIRE,
urged along the inside pursuing the leaders into turn, shifted out to race between foes on the bend and emptied out early. FUNKY, urged inside rivals
disputing the pace from the outset to the bend, gave way nearing the midway point of the turn. YOU SAY SO WAS SCRATCHED AT THE GATE AFTER
DISLODGING HIS RIDER AND RUNNING LOOSE BEFORE THE START.

Footnotes
TIN BADGE broke readily, angled to the rail in the opening stages dropping just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, switched out three wide
racing into upper stretch and produced a solid closing response to wear down the leader and wrest the advantage under brisk left handed pressure.
MISTER BANJOMAN broke inwards momentarily impeding rivals, sped to the lead angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the
backstretch, held sway to upper stretch but couldn't fend off the winner. RACER was prompted to a forward placing while angling to the inside tracking just
off the pacesetter, saved ground to the lane and edged a rival for a share. MR. JAGERMEISTER, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the leader
racing to the far turn, faded into the lane. GREAT BLAKE switched outside foes early to track just off the second flight between, shifted three deep nearing
the far turn but offered no rally. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN, shuffled back out of tight quarters at the start, continued three deep between foes to the
backstretch, was held up avoiding tight quarters racing past the five furlong marker and offered no rally. GO GOLD settled along the inside early, swung out
five wide racing into the lane but proved no threat. THETRASHMANSCOMING, caught in tight quarters start, came under pressure to contend while caught
four wide racing to the backstretch and dropped out early.

Footnotes
THEMANLOOK was rated between foes tracking the pacesetter in second flight, conceded some position while angling to the rail nearing the far turn, saved
ground to the lane and came through inside foes to wrest the advantage in time under pressure. TRADIN UP tracked off the pacesetter three deep between
foes into the backstretch, continued under patient handling into the far turn, shifted four wide racing into the lane while being roused to advance but was just
outkicked. WHISKYFORBREAKFAST stalked just off the pacesetter inside rivals in the opening half, advanced inside the leader to press the issue along the
rail entering the far turn, dueled for command past midstretch but weakened late. VIVACE sped to the lead near the inside racing to the backstretch, met a
rival's challenge to duel for command outside that foe to upper stretch but yielded between foes late. MONROES DREAM was prompted to a forward
placing four wide tracking just off the leaders to the backstretch but gave way racing into the far turn. RAHAAL dropped back early, was soon outdistanced
but walked off the course under his own power.
