Footnotes
VINNY FROM DIXIE was allowed to settle early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run
and drew off as a handy winner. LIVE A GOOD LIFE was reserved just off the leaders early while racing from between foes, moved up to offer a bid nearing
the three-sixteenths pole, gained a brief lead between calls, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. ALWAYS
WORKING broke sharply to press the pace of the dueling leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to engage into the stretch and stayed on well in the
drive. SPARKLING LUTE was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. RACE OFFICE dueled for
the lead from the inside and weakened through the final furlong. L D' RADO GOLDRUSH disputed the pace from between foes, moved three-wide through
the turn and weakened. CODE CHARLIE broke in to bump rival, lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn, did not reach contention and was
eased through the lane.

Footnotes
Z'S SPERANZA bobbled at the start, recovered quickly to track the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
opened a clear margin approaching the stretch and drew off as a handy winner. INDIAN POWER was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained
inside for the drive, was no match for the winner but clearly second best. SWISS SKIMMER was forwardly placed throughout, raced four-wide through the
second turn and failed to gain in the drive. STRATUS BIRD broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened after going five furlongs.
GOLDIE'S DARLINS raced four-wide through both turns, settled off the leaders early, angled out further approaching the stretch and did not threaten.
STORMY MIST hopped at the start, lagged early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out nearing the quarter and did not menace. PORTRAY
UR VISION raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. HARDSENSE steadied
soon after the start, chased the leaders while racing four-wide, checked repeatedly through the back-stretch and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
SADIE SUE raced unhurried early, advanced four-wide through the turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths marker, opened a clear margin in
mid-stretch and drew off with complete authority. SOPHIE'S DREAM was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out
further in mid-stretch and finished willingly. COASTAL REIGN disputed the pace from between foes, angled out in mid-stretch and gave way.
UNDERSTATED BEAUTY vied for the lead from the inside and weakened after going a half. NOUMEA showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the
turn and failed to menace. EARLY MORN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. COLOUR OF MONEY settled off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. GUIDED BY ANGELS broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing four-wide
and weakened after going three furlongs.

Footnotes
FORTUNE IN SILK pressed the pace of PEACEABLE KINGDOM while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
opened a clear margin into the stretch and drew off with complete authority. PEACEABLE KINGDOM was away in good order to set a pressured pace from
the inside, could not match strides with the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. O'S SO SERIOUS dwelt, raced unhurried early, moved
three-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. SALSA VERDE settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn and finished
with some late run. LINCHPINS JEWEL raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and failed to
gain late. CLOCKER'S CHOICE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. FINE ELEMENT chased the leaders from the
inside and weakened after going three furlongs. MY SECSEA SENORITA was off a step slow, lacked early speed and did not offer a bid.

FANTASTIC DAY was bumped at the break, raced reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
quickly opened a clear lead and was ridden out to be kept to task. COOLER THAN YOU lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out
nearing the quarter, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with good energy. ALESUND lagged early, saved ground through the turn,
angled out in mid-stretch and finished with a late bid. VICTUS raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out into the lane
and finished evenly. FIREBALL RED disputed the pace from off the rail for a half and gave way. SOVEREIGN NATION was bumped at the start, dueled for
the early advantage while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. HEAVENLY PURSUIT pressed the pace from the inside, steadied nearing the
seven-sixteenths pole and weakened thereafter. DERBY DREAMING settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and weakened.
STRATEGIC HOUR lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

SHELBY R. pressed the pace of A GOOD SNICKER while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid in tandem with HONEY BAY BEE nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, pressed that rival and was up in the closing yards. HONEY BAY BEE tracked the pace of A GOOD SNICKER from the inside, moved
up with the winner to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, held the winner at bay into the final yards but could not resist that foe late. PINCHALINCH
lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, reached a striking position but failed to gain late. CANCALE was forwardly
placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. SMASHING SUCCESS settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn and finished evenly. A GOOD SNICKER was away in good order to set a pressured pace and weakened after going three furlongs. FORTY
KNOT CURRENT lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and did not menace. LIRIO TIGRADO was off

Footnotes
WILD WILD KINGDOM tracked the pace of FATS DOMINUS from the inside, angled out into the lane, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and held off
that resurging rival to narrowly prevail. FATS DOMINUS was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, responded when headed by the winner with a sixteenth to run and came back to just miss. BANZE NO OESTE (BRZ) raced four-wide
through both turns, was unhurried early, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a steady rally. DUSTIN'S PASSION settled off the leaders early,
saved ground through the second turn, remained inside for the drive, lacked racing room nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly when clear.
DEPUTY'S COMMAND lagged early, raced six-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. ONE TUFF MINISTER raced off the pacesetters early,
saved ground through the second turn, angled out approaching the stretch and was not a factor. MY FOOLISH BEAU raced just off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the second turn and weakened. OLDTIMERS VISION raced off the leaders throughout and gradually weakened. PRIVATE BOSS broke in
the air then was allowed to settle, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. ATYPIQUE raced four-wide through the first turn, pressed
the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going three-quarters.

vigorous drive and proved best. PULPITS POWER was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, responded when challenged by the
winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied through a prolonged drive and just missed. ZIPPY GROOM settled off the leaders early, saved ground through
the second turn, reached a striking position and failed to gain late. ITS ALLABOUT JERRY raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the
second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly. GRAN FIESTA was off slow and bumped, lagged early and was no factor. CHRISTINE'S
JACK was off slow and bumped, raced off the rail through the second turn and did not menace. FOR HIM chased the leaders while racing four-wide and

STAY IN GRACE was away alertly to duel for the early advantage with PERFECT PROMISE from off the rail, disposed of that rival before going a half,
opened a clear margin and was ridden out to the wire. CHOTEAU lagged early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished
with good energy. PIN UP LADY was bumped at the start, lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole
and finished willingly. CLASSIC LEAH chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. CHEROKEE LOUISE bobbled at the start,
settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and did not offer a bid. BEAU ROCKS was
bumped at the start, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and did not menace. TIMBERLAKE GAGE
was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. PERFECT PROMISE broke sharply to dispute the pace while racing
three-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
MIRROR IMAGE was reserved just off the leaders from off the rail, angled out approaching the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run and was fully
extended to hold OMACHE KID safe late. OMACHE KID was never far back, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished
with good late energy. SO LUCKY was bumped at the break, dueled for the lead from off the rail, opened a clear margin into the lane and gave way through
the final furlong. FAR WEST was bumped at the start, lagged early, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a late rally. BOUND TO GO settled off
the leaders throughout and failed to rally. SCOUT PATROL was bumped at the start, raced off the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through
the turn and was not a factor. GRAYCASTER was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. ONLY
THE HIGH ROAD was bumped at the start, showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. CODY'S CHOICE was bumped
at the break, disputed the pace for a half and weakened.
