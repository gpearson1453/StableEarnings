Footnotes
AUBURN sped clear soon after the start, rated along through a moderate early pace, widened well off the rail into the lane, and was kept driving while
drifting out unchallenged. SURPRISE ARRIVAL raced four to five wide around the turn, and was along to go clear of the others on her left lead. GRAVEL
GERTIE moved up past the three-eighths pole, but had nothing further and was outfinished for the place. RACK DADDY broke a bit awkwardly and got
bumped by BENNY'S GIRLFRIEND a stride later, and was no threat three to four wide. BENNY'S GIRLFRIEND got sandwiched and shut off between
NOBLE LEGACY and RACK DADDY at the start, and was never close. MUSICAL LADY chased outside and was done after a half-mile. SILVER PALMS
chased inside and retired after a half. NOBLE LEGACY stumbled badly and veered out into BENNY'S GIRLFRIEND at the start, and lost contact with the
field before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
STREET EXCHANGE prompted the early pace outside NO RESPECT, took over outside her stablemate with a quarter-mile remaining, and widened under
a drive. DOMINEERING was never far back, offered a mild response between horses through mid stretch and went clear of the others. BLUE PAYNT hit the
left side of the gate at the start, recovered to track from outside, and lacked a solid bid. NO RESPECT set the pace inside to late on the turn, and weakened
through the stretch. LIESEL saved ground under urging on the turn, and did not respond. LAYALI broke behind the field, was taken widest early at the back,
and remained outrun. V K PRINCESS was never prominent.

Footnotes
CPT. RHETT BUTLER broke to the lead, rated along inside backing down the pace a bit through the middle stages, shook off REMASTER after six furlongs
and widened under pressure. JUSTINTHENICKOTIME saved ground in striking range for six furlongs, moved out to the three-path at the top of the stretch,
and rallied to go clear of the rest. REMASTER (IRE) brushed with GENGHIS at the start, prompted the pace outside the winner, got shaken off approaching
the stretch, and salvaged the show. SKYRAY was slow away from the gate and outrun to the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch and improved mildly
for a share. SUBLIMINALCRIMINAL was slow into stride, followed behind JUSTINTHENICKOTIME around the far turn, was stymied attempting to move
through between the latter and REMASTER in mid stretch, tried going inside REMASTER and took up past the sixteenth-pole to lose any chance at a better
placing. IMPERIAL MOMENT lagged well back early, moved up four wide midway on the far turn, but could not sustain the bid. GENGHIS brushed with
REMASTER at the start, and was no factor three wide. MUKULWITZ tracked outside, and faded before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
INDEPENDENT MISS took closer order with a four-wide run on the turn, battled outside PRINCESS CORO into the final furlong, and edged away late.
PRINCESS CORO was up between the early leaders, got outpaced into the turn and went around three wide, reached a short lead in upper stretch, dueled
inside the winner past the eighth-pole and was worn down in the closing yards. MIRACULOUSBLESSING vied outside PRINCESS CORO and GITANA
early, took over from the latter five-sixteenths out, got overhauled by the top two through the furlong grounds, and gave way on her left lead. GITANA vied
inside rivals early, and weakened approaching the stretch. CROSS TEA steadied coming out last from the gate, wound up four to five wide around the turn,
and made no impact. SEAPORT STORM was finished early inside. RACHEL'S WISH raced far back throughout. JEANIE VEE was ridden along inside on
the turn, and had no response.

Footnotes
PROJECTED (GB) saved ground just off the early pace, waited behind the leaders midway on the far turn, split horses rallying a sixteenth out and outkicked
D'CRAZINESS to the wire. D'CRAZINESS advanced to contention three wide approaching the stretch, wrested command outside MOZO BELLO coming to
the eighth-pole, got joined from inside by PROJECTED and was outfinished. MOZO BELLO prompted the pace early, poked a head in front between horses
after six furlongs, and weakened through deep stretch inside the top two. PONT DU GARD saved ground on the turn, moved out widest for the drive and
gained too late. DONJI raced in the second flight to the stretch, and closed some ground behind the leaders although unable to seriously menace.
ROBINTAKINCHARGE established a manageable pace for nearly six furlongs, and gave way. MR WRENCH IT was always outrun.

BOURBON IN MAY saved ground allowed to lope along for six furlongs, began moving near the quarter-pole while being guided out four wide, rallied past
the leaders from outside entering the last furlong and was geared down the last 50 yards. ROCKET JOE COPPER advanced three wide on the far turn,
reached a short lead outside SOUPER JAGUAR and INDIMAAJ through mid stretch, continued on well but was no match for the top one. INDIMAAJ
pressed the pace outside SOUPER JAGUAR, vied for command from late on the far turn to the furlong grounds, and weakened. SOUPER JAGUAR set a
pressured pace inside, and yielded through the lane. AFICIONADO saved ground early, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and could not reach
contention. CAMBRE faded after a half-mile inside. KING OTTOKAR was forwardly placed in the two-path, and dropped back after six furlongs. RIGGINS
was outrun three wide.

Footnotes
ARRIVEDERLA vied outside FOURTH DESIGN before clearing off after a quarter-mile, got hooked from outside by STONE HANDS five-sixteenths out,
battled the rest of the way and gamely prevailed inside rivals. STONE HANDS stayed close early, challenged late on the turn poking a head in front, fought
between horses through the final stages and just missed. WHYRUAWESOME was not fully set at the start and broke a step slow, recovered to a stalking
spot, entered the lane with aim outside the dueling leaders, loomed through deep stretch but hung late. BLACK PEPPER lagged well back three wide to the
lane, and improved mildly for a share. KRAMMY BOY raced three to four wide in range for a half-mile, and faded in the drive. FOURTH DESIGN vied inside
the winner early, and could not keep pace through the turn on the rail. DARK AGES broke awkwardly and trailed early despite heavy urging, advanced
briefly around the turn four wide, and tired through the late stages. KILLA DEE faded for wide nearing the stretch.

Footnotes
TENCH pressed the pace outside GO GONE GONE from the start, finished determinedly and wore that rival down in the closing yards. GO GONE GONE
dashed to the front at the start, cut a rapid pace inside, held stubbornly but was nailed near the wire. CITRUS BURST pursued the leaders inside from the
outset, shifted to the three-path in deep stretch and narrowed the gap. SARASOTA COUNTY stayed in range around the turn two wide, moved outside the
top trio and ran on. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR posed no threat three wide. CABLE CHANNEL trailed four wide late on the turn, moved in through the drive
and gained ground belatedly. FRENCHMEN STREET was outrun to the stretch four wide, and made no headway. LEMNISCATE saved ground and was
through before reaching the stretch. TENACITY ZIP was outrun throughout. SMALL REASON showed little inside.

Footnotes
TONY SMALL advanced outside after a half-mile, took over outside D'GUAPO five-sixteenths out, pulled clear into the stretch and was kept to pressure.
SKYLINE VIEW stayed in range four wide for six furlongs, brushed with MOZANO through mid stretch and went clear for the place. MOZANO pursued the
pace three wide, brushed with SKYLINE VIEW while inside that one near the eighth-pole, and weakened. BELLAMY'S TREASURE was outrun to the top of
the lane three wide, and offered a mild response to land the last major share. CONSILIUM got bumped by DRAMATIC KITTEN at the start, lagged far back
for six furlongs, and passed tired horses. D'GUAPO set the pace inside, got caught by the winner late on the turn, and gave way. RICKY RUN was never
prominent. AYCAPOTE became fractious in the gate rearing up and dislodging the rider prior to the start, raced wide and was outrun. DRAMATIC KITTEN
broke out bumping CONSILIUM, showed speed outside to the turn, and tired before reaching the stretch. EAGLES DAWN broke slowly, and retired after a
half-mile. TREASURE RUN was finished early. This race was hand timed.
