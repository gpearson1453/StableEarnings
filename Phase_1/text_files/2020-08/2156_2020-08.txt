Footnotes
DOUBLE RED four wide when off the pace into the first turn, continued outside in the run up the backstretch, advanced and. ROMAN JEWELS pressed the
leader off the inside early, vied between rivals into the far turn while in the two path, continued between horses into and through much of the stretch, could
not match the winner late, clear for the place. CATCAKE broke on top, showed way into the first turn, dueled up the backstretch closest to the inside,
continued to vie along the rail into and through upper stretch, no match for the winner late, comfortably saved the show. LAURALEE COCODREE last away,
trailed for five furlongs, was never dangerous while picking off a couple of faltering rivals. GOTTABEGOLDEN in the second flight early, three wide bid far
turn, gave way soon after, continued to weaken through the stretch. BULLETSANDBOURBON was finished after a half, far back.

Footnotes
WILL B LATE allowed the pace to go early, continued unhurried onto the backstretch, advanced three wide on the leader final turn, took over entering the
stretch, drove well clear. OVERLY SWEET void of any early speed, continued to trail the middle half, saved some ground when advancing second turn,
switched to the far outside for the drive and finished willingly to be in time for the place, no threat to the winner. MISSGREELEY'SSONG settled off the early
pace, closest to the leader the middle four furlongs, could not match the winner's advance in the second turn, took over the second spot inside the furlong
marker but failed to contain the runner up in the final strides. SALT LIFE ANGEL got clear through a quick opening quarter, continued to show the way by
daylight up the backstretch, faltered when confronted by the winner entering the stretch. REASON TO WALTZ last to leave, three wide into the lane,
dropped inside for the drive, lacked a significant closing response. AMANDASCHIME raced in mid pack, gave way after four furlongs, well beaten. BROKE
AND PRAYING chased the early leader, stopped after a half, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
ARCTIC ROSE four wide into the first turn when with the first flight, cleared late in that bend, relaxed in the run up the backstretch, continued to hold a large
advantage through the final turn, not threatened in the drive under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. VENN closest to the winner, could do little with that
rival in the drive, clearly second best. THUNK went one paced throughout, finished up best of the rest. CAJUN UP settled in mid pack, lost some position
while off the inside second turn, improved position a bit while not a real threat. DUSTY BOY void of speed, remained always back. FAITH'S RACEDAY
within striking distance in the early going, had nothing for the drive. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN four wide into the first turn, fell back to trail before a half and
finished well back.

Footnotes
EXTON last away, was outrun early, advanced four wide through the turn to reach a striking position, challenged on the outside entering the stretch, edged
clear late under firm handling. CAJUN CARMELIZED broke alertly, was clear exiting the chute, continued to show the way up the backstretch off the inside,
three path into the lane, responded when the winner came alongside in upper stretch and proved stubborn to the end while prevailing late for the place.
DANCEHALL JACK broke with the field, raced with the main body onto the main track, chased the runner up through the turn along the inside, continued to
race the rail in the drive and was getting to that same rival late for the second spot. MADELYN'S WILD MAX was evenly paced off the inside early, three
wide through the turn, steered in a bit for the drive then lacked a late punch. FANCY THIS lacked early foot, failed to muster a rally when called on for the
drive. B RASEN also failed to menace. MR RED SENSATION headed up the second flight in pursuing the runner up out of the chute, gave way before a
half.

Footnotes
STANDING MAN vied four wide into the first turn, got clear onto the backstretch, continued to show the way into and through the final turn, drew out through
the lane while kept to task. FAR OUT TIME void of early foot, began to advance into the far turn while three wide, rallied four wide into the lane, up to be
clear for the place, no threat to the winner. LAST NITE OUT back off the pace and the inside, raced three wide through the final turn, displayed a mild
amount of late interest to gain the nod for the show. SPECIAL BINGO forwardly placed early, settled well off the winner the middle half, tepid advance into
the lane, chased that rival past the furlong marker, little left late to lose a couple of positions. SON OF PATRIOT vied early while three wide, chased the
winner up the backstretch and far turn then began to give way. IBEAM settled in mid pack for six furlongs, had nothing for the drive. WHATAFIND bothered
at the break to be last away, was never involved to be always outrun.

Footnotes
MACHO ROCCO forwardly placed early off the inside, advanced and challenged three wide turn, vied on the outside into the stretch, shook clear when
straightened for home, enough left to withstand the runnerup late. MIDNIGHT BAYOU last away, void of speed, asked along three then four wide into the
stretch, finished willingly to be closing the gap on the winner late. PILLAGE DA VILLAGE away well, dueled up front in the two path up the backstretch, vied
between horses turn, came in slightly to bother SAPONI a bit in upper stretch, outkicked that one for the show while no match for the top two. SAPONI away
in good order, set or forced the pace for three furlongs along the inside, was beginning to tire a bit while coming out slightly upper stretch, steadied, also
proved no match for the top two, not enough to regain the show. GOOSE settled off the pace, lacked a response in the drive. TOO MUCH BOURBON raced
back, failed to threaten.

Footnotes
BOLD THIRST sprinted clear to show the way through the first turn, held a sizable advantage in the run up the backstretch, turned back a rival into the
stretch to be clear again, not threatened to the wire under steady handling. BIG BOY DAVE REX closest to the winner just off the inside, closed the gap on
that rival and another foe late in the final turn while directly behind that pair, moved out for the drive, floated out further by a drifting FIRE BLASTER past the
furlong marker, regain the second position late under brisk pressure. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY settled off the pace while saving some ground, moved closer
turning for home, outkicked for the second spot. KINGDOM WAY lacked speed while racing outside, asked along second turn, continued one paced through
the stretch in lacking a late kick while being floated out by a tiring foe late. ATLANTIC RULER void of any early speed, never a factor. MUSCADINE off a
step slow, remained always back. FIRE BLASTER broke out and slowly, four wide into the first turn, advanced with an outside middle move, challenged the
winner late in the final turn, gave way soon after and drifted out repeatedly in the run to the wire.

Footnotes
ROSE CROWN with the pace from the start, narrowly showed the way into the turn, headed entering the stretch, regained the advantage soon after, pulled
away through the lane while kept to pressure. BOSSY'S TROUBLE with the pace outside the winner and between rivals, fell back off the issue into the lane,
had little for the winner in the drive, came back for the place. GALAXY STAR in the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground through the
lane, went evenly to the wire to earn part of the show. MY HEART DOMINUS pressed the top two in the three path up the backstretch, advanced and put a
head in front turning for home, got out to lose the advantage back to the winner, continued to drifted out to the wire in coming up empty late. BELINDA went
one paced outside in lacking a serious closing bid. SEISMIC in the second group outside, four wide into the lane, lacked a closing bid. CHEROKEE
WILDCAT void of early foot, trailed for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. BEAR THE MOMENT within striking distance in the
early going, began a steady fade before three furlongs. STOPPEAKINGONME last away, remained always back.
