Footnotes
NINE SHOTS closest to the leader, closer along the inside late in the turn, lacked clear room, moved outside to be four wide into the lane, rebid on the
outside past the furlong marker, shook clear then had enough left late to withstand a belatedly bid from the runner up. BROTHER DAVID void of early
foot,three wide into the lane, shifted out widest, finished full of run to be up for the place, too late for the winner. LOUISIANA JAZZ away in good order,
sprinted well clear and to the inside the opening furlong, continued to lead by a wide margin into the turn, responded when challenged late in the bend, gave
ground grudgingly to the winner until late, caught in the final strides for the place. TRAELEE in the second flight up the backstretch and early turn, moved
closer off the inside late in the turn, continued to chase the leader past the furlong marker then faltered. YOUCANBETONME remained back in lacking a
closing response. BORODINO last away, trailed, pulled up early in the turn, vanned off.

Footnotes
ROCK THE JUKEBOX broke alertly, sprinted well clear past the wire the first time, rated while holding a considerable advantage the middle half mile, called
on for some turn turning for home in the three path, drifted stretch, held off the runner up late under firm handling in a determined effort. FOR REAL ALICE
also away in good order, closest to the winner through the first turn, chased that rival up the backstretch, moved a bit closer late in the final turn, could not
get to that same rival in the drive while being floated out by the winner. remained clear for the place. ROYAL ALEXANDRA broke in mid pack, was taken
firmly in hand while a bit slow to settle midway on the first turn, pulled onto the backstretch, four wide turning for home, finished up best of the rest. ZAO'S
DREAMS settled in the second flight early, continued one paced to come up empty for the drive. THAI CHILI SUE last to leave, remained always back.
STUMBERG trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
JACK'S KISS broke well, raced with the early pace into the first turn inside, allowed the speed to go onto the backstretch, stalked into the far turn, steered
out five wide when advancing into the stretch, bid, drove steadily clear. LITTLE WISE GUY last away, void of speed in trailing, saved some ground in the
two path and inside of several foes turning for home, split horses past the furlong marker, finished willingly to earn the place. CORVETTE SPIRIT lacked
speed while racing well wide, continued in the four path into the far turn, fanned six wide into the lane by the winner, staged a mild rally to earn the show.
CLEVER RACER four wide when with the pace into the first turn, continued to vie onto and up the backstretch, appeared to come in slightly to tighten up
IZZY B WINN entering the far turn resulting in that one checking up, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, brushed with FAST DUDE nearing
midstretch, weakened the final furlong after being headed by the winner. IZZY B WINN broke on top, dueled backstretch along the inside, in a bit tight into
the far turn, checked up, fell back, evenly drive. FAST DUDE within striking distance off the inside, ranged up to challenge four wide turning for home,
brushed midstretch when vying, also gave way the final furlong. LUKE THE DRIFTER back off the pace off the inside, asked along far turn, in some traffic
late in that bend, had little left for the stretch run.

LUKE'S CAJUN STAR moved up to vie between rivals into the turn, continued to contest the issue with pressed from inside and out, long, extended drive,
dug in late to prove best in a game effort. PHILLY set or forced the pace throughout inside the winner and closest to the rail, outfinished in the late going.
HOORAY AUSTIN pressed the issue early outside, three wide into the stretch, continued to vie past the furlong marker, could not match the top two late,
saved the show. GIANT MESA back off the pace and the inside, shifted out widest nearing the midstretch, went evenly to the wire. BOOTH ROAD SHINE
last away, trailed, failed to muster a rally.

Footnotes
G CISIVE broke back, continued to lack speed while outside, was six wide into the lane, lugged in when nearing midstretch and challenging, continued to
come in a bit in the run to the wire, up in time. COMMON LAW CAT also lacked any early foot, came five wide and inside the winner turning for home,
brushed with that one approaching midstretch, late bid, outkicked. WHISKEY FACTOR settled off the pace and the inside, remained in mid pack through the
turn, responded when called on for run when straightened for home, late bid between horses, brief lead, not enough late. ROSES N' RUBIES back off the
early pace outside, moved closer while four wide exiting the turn, vied past the furlong marker then hung late between horses. WESTERN DAYS broke
alertly, dueled in the run up the backstretch along the inside, put that foe away early in the turn, second duel soon after, disposed of that second foe nearing
midstretch,

Footnotes
TWIN SISTERS hustled clear after the start, showed the way into the turn while given a bit of a breather, turned back a bid entering the stretch, clear again
soon after, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. INAWIC back off the early pace while racing outside, closer four wide turning for home,
chased the winner past the furlong marker and was slowly getting to that one late. BEYOND D'ORO broke forwardly, chased the winner into the turn, tried
that rival from the outside entering the stretch, could not keep up in the run to the wire, outfinished late for the place. THERUNAWAYCAMP off a step slow,
raced well back early, staged a mild rally to improve position while well wide in the drive. KISSMELIKEUMISSME in mid pack while racing toward the inside,
behind some traffic turning for home, improved slightly when clear, no real threat. MA CHER AMIO forwardly paced early off the inside, had little left for the
drive. SHELLEYS A WARRIOR broke sharp, fell back inside, tired in the drive. VELVET NIGHT made little impact outside. MYLA RUBI was finished early.
ST. MONICA dwelt at the start, trailed well back throughout.

MISTER INTUITION stalked the leader off the inside into and through the first turn, crept closer through the final turn, challenged on the outside turning into
the stretch, long drive, put that foe away inside the furlong marker, responded when the runnerup challenged on the outside late, narrowly gained the nod in
game fashion. SILVER KING last to leave, raced back early, began a steady three wide advance before a half, challenged the winner from the outside with
less than a furlong remaining, outkicked in the late going to narrowly miss. KISS OF THE WOLF cleared early, showed the way up the backstretch,
responded when the winner came alongside late in the final turn, dueled upper stretch then could not keep up with that one or contain the runner up, saved
the show. IZZY'S BABY BOY within striking distance in the early going, came up empty for the drive. FAST VERDICT settled off the pace, went evenly
throughout. I'M D'CAT broke back, lacked speed, five wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. SINGINGINTHEWIND lacked speed, four wide exiting
the final turn, also failed to respond int he drive.

Footnotes
BELLAMY CAY broke well, dueled into the first turn off the inside, got clear onto the backstretch,showed the way into and through the final turn, responded
when challenged from the outside into the lane, put that rival away past the furlong marker to be clear again, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. R
T'S DUCHESS lacked early foot, rallied four wide out of the final turn, finished with good energy to be getting to the winner, too late. STORIED TRIP settled
off the pace and the inside, advanced and tried the winner from the outside turning into the stretch, flattened out and could not match that one the final
furlong, caught late for the second spot. SWEET AMELIA lacked early foot, raced in the two path through the final turn, improved position inside of several
foes while not a serious threat to the top three. PLAYIN N TRAFFIC settled in mid pack, lacked a closing response in the drive to finish up evenly.
WILDABOUT AUDREY forwardly placed for six furlongs, had little left for the drive. INCOMING WIRE pressed the winner early from along the inside,
chased up the backstretch, finished after a half. TEN TAP DANCES rank then lost irons soon after the start, got out into the first turn, regained irons but was
always outrun.

Footnotes
BROTHER JUKEBOX within striking distance while racing outside, advanced three wide into a challenging position late in the turn, took over entering the
stretch, quickly clear, kept to task. DOUBLE PRIORITY broke in good order, fell back into the second flight between horses and inside the winner, rallied
three wide and behind that rival into the lane, finished willingly to be well clear for the place. GRIP TIGHT lacked speed, loomed a threat four wide and
outside the runner up exiting the turn, flattened out to prove no match for that rival or the winner, best of the rest. COACH O within striking distance for a half
while saving ground, came up empty for the stretch run. WICKED STATEMENT void of speed in trailing early, passed tiring rivals while not a serious threat.
RONNIE'S REASONING void of speed, saved ground to no avail in lacking a serious closing response. BIG COUNT away well from between rivals, edged
clear to set the pace for a half, faltered when headed by the winner entering the stretch. HOUSTON PIPE chased the leader for four furlongs and gave way.
LIL BOYS IN TOWN was finished early, stopped, losing contact with the field and jogged in.
