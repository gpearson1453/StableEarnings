weakened late in the drive. HIGH REGARD chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane while making a bid but faded late in the stretch drive.

final stages. HERSH broke awkwardly from the gate and raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane, rallied late in the stretch and was up for
place in the final stages. TRASHTALKINYANKEE chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane while making a bid, inched ahead near the eighth
pole but yielded late and lost place in the final stages. ZAPPER VAN WINKLE vied for the lead early on, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in
the stretch run. LOOKIN HIGH trailed the field early on, was off the rail into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. SEA OF HOPE chased the pace
early, was in the five path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. HARPER tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and faded

Footnotes
SEQUAYA tracked from midpack, advanced in hand along the rail and inside of rivals around the far turn, forged place while shifting off of the rail at the
three sixteenths pole, was herded out multiple paths by the inner leader while making a two wide bid for the lead in upper stretch cleared that inner foe
approaching the sixteenth pole, then held PADDY KAYE'S WILD at bay to the wire. PADDY KAYE'S WILD advanced from far off of the pace in the three
path around the far turn before circling inner rivals five wide passing the quarter pole, shied out a bit while forging place approaching the furlong pole, then
sustained her rally through the late stages while drifting in, but did not have enough to catch the leader. PACT set a pressured pace along the inside,
cleared away in hand into the far turn, was roused to hold an advantage from SEQUAYA in upper stretch, but drifted out causing outer foes to shy, then was
headed approaching the furlong pole, and gave way. PRINCESS LUCKY stalked along the inside, forged place from outer foes into the far turn while shifting
to the two path, but was outkicked when floated three wide by an inner foe turning for home. IMNOTSMALL pressed the pace from the six to the three path
around the first turn, but weakened four wide turning for home. TEMISINA trailed in the two to three path around the first turn, and failed to factor. COCO
CABALLO pressed the pace two wide and between horses, but weakened three wide turning for home. SLAINTE was bumped at the start, then was done
early, pulled up into the far turn, and was vanned off.
