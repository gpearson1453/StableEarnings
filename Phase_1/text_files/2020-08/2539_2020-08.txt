Footnotes
LA DUQUESA eased to the three path to give close chase and dug in leaving the turn to take over the final yards. NO SUGAR NO CREAM was a bit
fractious leaving the paddock and reluctant to load, tapered to the inside to rate the pace and dug in leaving the turn, but was caught in the final yards.
RUMOURIST exchanged light contact with Score One More leaving the gate then picked up the chase, rounded the turn just off the rail and finished evenly.
FLICKER'S PRINCESS chased the pace toward the outside then saved some ground on the turn. RICH IMAGE chased the pace well off the rail and
rounded the turn about the four path, then showed little more. SCORE ONE MORE exchanged light contact with Rumourist leaving the gate then picked up
the chase toward the inside, though, weakened leaving the turn.

Footnotes
CHARITABLE VISIT took over at the rail into the opening turn and rated a slim lead, was headed past the half mile pole and took a bit of a breather, but bid
leaving the three eighths pole to recover the edge at the rail midway on the far turn, raced clear while drifting into the lane and widened under steady
encouragement. CASTLES TRICK raced off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn four wide and dug in to duel for second through later yards. BUSTED HALO stalked the pace three wide and challenged leaving the three eighths pole,
took the lead nearing the five sixteenths but was caught midway on the far turn, dug in a close factor through the upper stretch then outfinished for second
later yards. WINNING SCHOLAR rated off the pace about the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole but flattened stride inside the sixteenth.
MELDON stalked the earlier pace two deep and took a slim lead past the half mile pole, dueled from that point but gave up the lead toward the five
sixteenths, continued close at the rail on the far turn then weakened. ALLEN JR. raced off the pace inside and showed little response down the backstretch.
JACOB T mostly saved ground.

Footnotes
CASTLE OF CAYLEE tapered in to pressure the early pace but became boxed in leaving the five sixteenths pole, recovered stride into the turn and came
between horses mid-stretch to determinedly take the nod through later yards. QUITE SUGGESTIVE chased the pace and took the lead in the three path
midway on the turn, dug in to best the efforts of Dianathehuntress through the stretch but gave way to the winner later yards. DANCE FOR A DIME chased
the pace off the rail, rounded the turn in the three path then finished well while taking over third later yards. DIANATHEHUNTRESS was reluctant to load
then hustled clear while angling to the inside to set the pace, gave up the lead midway on the turn but remained close to mid-stretch before flattening stride.
WHOSE THAT LADY was hesitant at the break and gave only distant early chase, improved her deficit in the five path of the turn, angled to the outside a
furlong away and finished well. LADY SPARROW gave chase outside, rounded the turn five wide and finished evenly. SUZIE Q SONDE saved ground.
OPEQUON DRAGONFLY chased the pace and rounded the turn in the two and three paths then faded.

Footnotes
OUR BAD GIRL gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the four path then dug in under a determined stretch ride to get up the final
strides. UNCANNY pressured the pace inside and contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, took the lead past the eighth pole and dug
in under steady stretch encouragement but was nipped at the wire. LADY REBEL was hustled up to set a pressured pace, contested the edge two deep on
the turn but was caught leaving the eighth pole and flattened stride later yards. GIN N SPICE chased the pace and rounded the turn near the rail, eased
outward mid-stretch but flattened stride from there. SAVANNAH ROXANNA chased the pace about the three path and finished evenly. FLEETRESS raced
well off the pace saving early ground then angled out nearing the head of the lane and finished evenly outside. PARTY ROCK gave chase but dropped back
midway on the turn and weakened. UNIQUE HUMOR raced well back. PALACE TWO STEP chased the pace toward the inside then faded on the turn.

Footnotes
CARMELO rated off the pace in the four and five paths then settled close into the backstretch, took the lead past the three eighths pole, drew clear
approaching the quarter then steadily drew away while kept alert down the lane. BEST OFFER took the lead into the first turn and rated the pace, was
caught past the nine sixteenths pole and gave chase down the backstretch, rounded the far turn off the rail then came back to duel for second. ROYAL
BLUE rated off the pace inside then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and dug in through the lane to take third under the
wire. FRENCH'S QUEST stalked the pace about the four path then settled close into the backstretch, took a brief lead at the seven sixteenths pole but was
caught past the three eighths, dropped back approaching the quarter then flattened the final furlong. A TRUE GENTLEMAN stalked the pace then took the
lead past the nine sixteenths pole, was caught toward the seven sixteenths and gave chase from that point but flattened stride in the four path of the far
turn. GLEN'S CASTLE raced off the pace outside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the five path of the far turn, moved to the outside entering
the stretch but showed little more. MANHATTAN PROJECT settled off the pace about the four path then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, but flattened stride in the five path of the far turn. SUPER BIRD was not a factor. JIFFY JOSH was only briefly close and faded after a half mile.

Footnotes
CATCH MY CABOOSE surged to the lead and took up residence inside to rate the pace, turned back the challenge of Hard Being Me leaving the half mile
pole, was given some rein toward the five sixteenths and raced clear into the far turn then proved much the best under steady stretch handling. RIP THORN
rated close to the early pace four wide then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path but proved no match in the stretch.
BLACK STEEL rated close toward the inside then picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail but flattened stride
the final sixteenth. STEP OUT DANCING saved early ground while racing off the pace then bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, angled to the outside leaving
the far turn and passed some rivals. HARD BEING ME rated close about the three path and challenged the winner into the backstretch, engaged in close
chase to the quarter pole but dropped back into the far turn and faded. RIDING CLOUD NINE settled off the pace about the four path, started a bid toward
the seven sixteenths pole but weakened leaving the far turn. JUST A LIL LUKEY was never a factor.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN SAVIOUR settled off the pace, mounted a three wide bid toward the five sixteenths pole to take the lead midway on the far turn and drew away
under steady handling. DANZ A REBEL settled back in the three and four paths the opening turn, bid toward the three eighths pole to improve position in
the four path of the far turn then had to settle for second best. SUNBRIDLED rated the pace inside and was met into the backstretch, recovered the edge
toward the seven sixteenths pole but gave it up at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened stride the final sixteenth. BOBBY AXELROD stalked the early
pace about the three path and moved to even terms into the backstretch, took a brief lead then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn in the three path but drifted into the lane and weakened. LASS MOMENT saved early ground and raced well off the pace leaving the first turn, bid
toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the six path and showed little more. KOPP CAT showed little response through the backstretch.
FIT BUT FAT settled off the pace off the rail then bid only mildly from the three eighths pole. OWL RUN was through early. ECLIPTICALS DEWEY rated
close to the early pace but faded leaving the first turn.
