Footnotes
ALL ABOUT KATHERN was unhurried early inside, came off the rail around the far turn beginning to get in gear, caught TERRIBLE TARA and
LETSNOTGETOEXCITED from outside past the furlong marker, and was geared down the last 70 yards. LETSNOTGETOEXCITED prompted the pace
outside TERRIBLE TARA, challenged for command approaching the stretch, proved no match for the winner and ran on late for second. TERRIBLE TARA
set the pace inside, and yielded through the last eighth of a mile. MADAME MOON lunged at the start and was off behind the field, saved ground outrun
early, advanced shifting two wide after six furlongs, and rallied for the last major share. STARSHIP BLANCA was outrun early, swung four wide leaving the
far turn and passed tired horses. SEAPORT STORM tracked outside the leaders for six furlongs, and tired. FOLEY SQUARE raced two then three wide,
and tired after a half-mile. PRINCESS MERIDA tired inside after six furlongs, and was vanned off after the finish. JAENT became unsettled in the gate
dislodging the rider, came away in good order, and was through early. VALID EMPRESS was four wide around the first turn, and never reached contention.
This race was hand timed, fractional times unavailable.

SO LONG CHUCK bumped with LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA at the start, shook clear from OX TROT after a half-mile, rated along in the two-path to the
stretch, and responded to hold QUASAR MOON safe. QUASAR MOON lagged well back early inside, moved out rallying in upper stretch, had the rider drop
the whip approaching the sixteenth-pole, and gained gradually outside the winner on his left lead. DESERT GENERAL raced forwardly between horses for
six furlongs, and finished evenly. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA bumped with SO LONG CHUCK at the start, saved ground throughout and lacked a solid bid.
LI'L MEATBALL raced four wide around the turn, and made no headway in the lane on his left lead. OX TROT prompted the early pace outside SO LONG
CHUCK, and weakened on the turn.

THUNDER RIDE took the lead in the two-path early, moved inside controlling the tempo for six furlongs, and responded through the stretch to stay clear.
NOBLE INDY shadowed THUNDER RIDE from outside throughout, was under a drive before completing six furlongs, and could not cut into the margin
under heavy pressure. STIRLING DRIVE hugged the rail all the way, and was one-paced through the drive inside the top two. HARBOUR MASTER (GB)
raced two then three wide for six furlongs, and was no threat with an even finish. CHEYENNE'S COLONEL raced three wide, and gave way suddenly
entering the far turn. This race was hand timed, fractional times unavailable.

Footnotes
STARSHIP VOYAGER outsprinted GOODBYE GABY for the early lead, went along removed from the rail winding up in the four-path turning for home,
shook off her pursuer hand urged through upper stretch, and was wrapped up late. GOODBYE GABY chased outside STARSHIP VOYAGER from the
outset, had the five-path into the stretch, and was clearly second best. FEARLESS GIRL broke slowly, saved ground outrun early, moved into third around
the turn and had nothing more. PURPLE PEOPLEEATER raced two then three wide around the turn, and posed no threat. GALWAY CITY was outrun
inside. EMMA ROSE reared in the grasp of her assistant starter at the break, flipped over backward unseating the rider and winding up draped across the
back door of the stall, was extricated and vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE GATE, EMMA ROSE WAS
DECLARED A NON-STARTER.

Footnotes
PONT DU GARD pressed the pace outside SINGINGINTHEJOHN, wore that rival down in deep stretch, and prevailed over DONJI in a blanket finish.
DONJI raced three to four wide around the turns within range, rallied on the far outside and was closing in at the wire. SINGINGINTHEJOHN fought rating
on the lead in the two-path early, settled down through the middle stages moving inside, dug in when challenged by PONT DU GARD after six furlongs, and
stayed on stubbornly. JOYFUL HEART tucked in behind the leaders to the far turn, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, finished willingly but was
edged out between horses. LUCKY FAST broke slowly, trailed for six furlongs, came three wide into the lane and passed tired horses. SOUPER COURAGE
raced in the second flight throughout, and made no impact. MR. PAPILLON saved ground and was finished before reaching the stretch. This race was hand
timed, fractional times unavailable.

Footnotes
WICKED TEMPTATIONS was sent from the gate, vied widest of a foursome up front entering the turn, gained the upper hand outside CAPITAN FOFO in
mid stretch, and drove clear. CAPITAN FOFO went up to contest the lead two wide between horses after a quarter-mile, stayed on gamely through a long
drive and saved the place. I'M MORE READY eyed the four-way battle on the turn, swung five wide approaching the stretch, and finished evenly outside.
STEADILY trailed early inside, moved to the far outside in the stretch and gained mildly. MONEY COME raced two wide around the turn, cut the corner into
the lane, lacked room inside CAPITAN FOFO through the furlong grounds, altered course and was one-paced to the finish. TRIBUTE FLAG contested the
pace between horses in the three-path on the turn, and weakened in the stretch. WILD ONE FOREVER sprinted clear after an alert start, got tackled by a
trio of pursuers past the half-mile marker, and gave way approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
PERT broke behind the field, dropped inside entering the first turn at the back, began moving after six furlongs getting guided out four wide, caught MISS
MY MACHO from outside in deep stretch and edged away under a drive. INTEREST saved ground in striking range for six furlongs, was boxed in behind
the leaders in upper stretch, was prevented from moving out as PERT came alongside a furlong out, shifted inside MISS MY MACHO and finished gamely
inside the winner. MISS MY MACHO raced forwardly to the stretch, reached a short lead outside KAYSERI through the furlong grounds, and weakened
through the late stages. TOKYO raced three wide around the turns, and finished evenly. LA VIEXA lost her footing at the break but was away alertly,
dropped back inside soon after that, and made no impact. JUST A BIT SASSY raced near the two-path for six furlongs, steadied behind a wall of horses at
the top of the stretch, and could not recover when clear. KAYSERI set the pace inside to the top of the lane, and gave way. MILLEFIORI followed CAT'S J N
J out at the start, entered the first turn four wide at the rear, and remained outrun. CAT'S J N J broke outward, pressed the pace outside KAYSERI for six
furlongs, and gave way near the stretch.

PANAREA tracked outside in the three-path, wrested command outside MS BIG SPRING in upper stretch, and drew off under pressure. CHARGE
ACCOUNT was reserved in the three-path early, rallied outside and wore down MS BIG SPRING for second. MS BIG SPRING broke alertly despite hitting
the right side of the gate, cut the pace in the two-path to the top of the stretch, could not hold off PANAREA and weakened through the late stages.
ABARRIO FOREVER saved ground outrun to the lane, moved off the rail approaching the sixteenth-pole and made no headway. FOXY LADY bumped with
CHANNELED'S ANGEL at the start, stayed in range three to four wide for a half-mile, and tired. CHANNELED'S ANGEL stumbled and bumped with FOXY
LADY at the break, showed early speed inside, and faded steadily after a half.

OVER THE CHANNEL was slow away from the gate and trailed early, moved up a bit inside after a half-mile, came two wide rallying off the far turn, shifted
out another path and reached the front outside BATTLE OF BLENHEIM and AFICIONADO in deep stretch. AFICIONADO saved ground in range to the
stretch, came off the rail with a late bid between horses, and finished gamely. BATTLE OF BLENHEIM took the early lead two wide, moved in showing the
way to the furlong grounds, and was overhauled on the rail through the last sixteenth of a mile. PROJECTED (GB) raced well back for six furlongs toward
the inside, moved off the rail in upper stretch and finished with good energy. INDIMAAJ got bumped by MONY at the start, prompted the pace outside
BATTLE OF BLENHEIM to the stretch, and gave way between horses a furlong out. MONY broke out into INDIMAAJ at the start, raced three wide and
lacked the needed response. MECHA CORTA was two wide on the turns, and faded after six furlongs. GRAN OMERO (VEN) saved ground outrun early,
and showed little.

MOON PISTOL stumbled and bumped ALL STAR SEILER at the start, moved through to get clear after an eighth of a mile, went along in the two-path
coming under a ride to fend off challengers late on the turn, stayed clear into the last furlong and had just enough to hang on. SUNDOWN KID lost ground to
the leaders under urging around the turn in the two-path, moved out four wide at the top of the lane, rallied on the far outside and ran out of ground. THE
SPIDER got sawed off between ALL STAR SEILER and SUNDOWN KID and checked back at the start, advanced with a four-wide run around the turn, but
could not sustain the rally through the final stages. GATOR FIFTY TWO pressed the early pace, bid outside MOON PISTOL five-sixteenths out, and
weakened through the lane. JUPI'S LIGHTNING bumped with REVOLVING STAR after the start, raced forwardly inside to the stretch, and tired staying on
his left lead. REVOLVING STAR bumped with JUPI'S LIGHTNING after the start, saved ground outrun for a half-mile, moved out in the stretch and could
not gain. LITTLE TEQUILA was under urging three wide on the turn, had no response and dropped far back. ALL STAR SEILER got bumped and pushed
out by MOON PISTOL at the start, and dropped far back after a half-mile.
