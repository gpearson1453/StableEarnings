KIKINBOY brushed at the break went unhurried through the backside being called upon outside the quarter pole circling out six wide in upper stretch
surging clear late. RUM ON THE ROCKS well rated gave a roused move on the far turn vying four wide down the lane proving willing while ceding to wide
pressure. UNITY slow early rallied on the far turn bidding from mid track down the lane threatening to the end. CONFISCATE sent clear set the pace holding
to daylight through the far turn, hooked on the inside in upper stretch would come up a bit short. PLUG AND PLAY tracked the pace waiting on the far turn
swinging seven wide in mid stretch finishing evenly. MACHA'S REWARD stalked the early pace tiring on the far turn. SENOR WILBUR was always outrun.
Due to a timer malfunction the six furlong split was unavailable.

hand urging the final eighth. TIZ THIRSTY slow early came four wide upper stretch showing late interest getting up for place on the wire. IAMTHEBESTTOO
raced evenly losing ground to upper stretch moving seven wide from the eighth pole just missing place. MY ALIMONY chased through the turn being
dispatched in upper stretch weakening under a drive. SHAKE IT OUT WEST chased through the turn tiring in upper stretch. NO SUNSHINE dropped well

Footnotes
FASHION ENVY gave a prompted middle move pressing on the far turn into upper stretch angling in from mid track needing all to put away rival late.
LAZZARELLA away alertly set a pressured pace dueling through the far turn then down the stretch ceding grudgingly late along the inside. FOXY GATOR
prompted the pace through the backside chasing on the far turn, extending in the three path in upper stretch angled out to mid track while staying on late.
THIRSTY GAL raced evenly through the backside then faded on the far turn angling to mid track in upper stretch mustering enough to best the others. LA
LOVA played no factor. AZARCH hustled along would tire on the far turn. HERETOPLAY tracked early then gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
AMACE broke sharply setting a pressuring pace shaking clear while racing off the inside to upper stretch holding firm the final eighth. BIG SAVER a step
slow in mid pack rallied along the inside in upper stretch getting up for place. CHAIRMAN GAREY tracked the pace merging off a loose leader in upper
stretch vying willingly though no match late. AMERICAN SPARROW slow early lagged through the turn finding belated stride in upper stretch finishing well.
IRON GRIP slow early rallied to upper stretch finishing evenly. DIAMOND RIDER raced mid pack proving no menace. DEMON BUSTER was never
involved. MOOVIN ON MACHEN chased through the turn tiring in upper stretch. MAVERICK'S ACE raced evenly through the turn then gave way in upper
stretch. ICY INTERLUDE pressed through the turn then wilted abruptly in upper stretch.
