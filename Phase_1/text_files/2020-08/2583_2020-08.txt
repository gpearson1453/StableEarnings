APPELLANT tracked the dueling leaders from along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, tipped four wide
entering the lane, assumed command in mid stretch and proved best. WISE MARKET settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail at the back of
a compact field, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to get up for the place. ONE LAST HIT away alertly
and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue from the outside of KHAIKY'S COMMAND in the run
down the backside and through the final turn, was overtaken in mid stretch and just failed to hold the place. ZETAMARIE away well and stalked the leaders
into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to mount a late bid while finishing four out
from the rail in the drive. KHAIKY'S COMMAND broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from
along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, but was outfinished in the lane.

Footnotes
STAY FANTASTIC away alertly and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, forced the issue into the
backstretch while racing two wide, assumed command approaching the final turn, held the narrowest of leads into the stretch and battled determinedly to
hold NOT YET off to prevail. NOT YET settled at the back of a compact field while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, gained
ground while racing three wide through the second turn to hold a stalking position into the backstretch, rallied smartly two out from the rail through the final
turn, but was unable to get by a stubborn STAY FANTASTIC late, while proving easily second best. DRILLER tracked the leader from along the rail entering
the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, was unable to match strides with the top pair entering the final turn, and
had nothing to offer over the final furlong. ERLICH broke sharply and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through
the stretch the first time, battled from the inside of STAY FANTASTIC entering the backstretch, was unable to keep pace with that rival in the run to the final
turn, and was eased over the final furlong.

CAPE LITE away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside through the second turn
and into the backstretch, opened a clear advantage into the final turn, increased that margin through the turn, but was all out to fend off a late charge by
SIMPLY GOLDEN to prevail. SIMPLY GOLDEN away alertly, but was taken in hand and dropped well behind the field entering he stretch the first time,
mounted her bid from the back of the pack one out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to just miss.
HEREVERYWISH settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the second turn, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and
finished from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. GIFTED GREY stalked the leaders from along the rail entering the stretch the first time angled off
the rail entering the second turn and raced three wide into the backstretch, rallied three out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished evenly four wide
in the drive. SATURNA broke sharply and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide through
the final turn, but needed more late. PARIANNE stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, held a striking
position to the midpoint of the backstretch before beginning to weaken. BONITA B hopped at the start to get away poorly, rushed up entering the first turn
and pressed the leader two out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue in the run down the backstretch, was unable to
keep pace with CAPE LITE in the run to the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.

MUSTACHIO away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, dictated the pace from along the rail in the run down
the backstretch and into the final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in deep stretch to hold off a surging CHEF. CHEF unhurried early while
dropping back to trail, rallied four wide from the back of the pack entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to just miss.
NEVERADOUBT stalked the leaders while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed two out from the rail in the drive
to prove best of the rest. TRUPON ONLINE away well and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied
three wide through the final turn, but was unable to mount a serious late bid while finishing three wide in the drive. MOUSSAKA CHEF broke sharply and
tracked the leader into the stretch the first time, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but was outfinished in the
late stages. ACT UP stalked the leaders from along the rail through the stretch the first time, pulled his way along from the inside in the run to the final turn
while gaining a tracking trip, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, but was outfinished late. WILL TO GOLD settled off the early pace while saving
ground at the rail entering the lane the first time, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.
