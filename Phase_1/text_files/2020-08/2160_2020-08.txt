Footnotes
SUPER TWENTY FIVE pulled herself to the front while being guided to the inside and rated the pace, came under some riders' pressure midway on the far
turn and widened under steady handling. BOOM BOOM GONE saved ground off the pace then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near
the rail, dueled for second just inside the sixteenth pole but was not a match for the winner. EARNED THE SHOT settled off the pace toward the inside then
eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn six wide and was along for third later yards. I AM I WILL saved
ground off the early pace then bid nearing the three eighths pole, eased to the three path rounding the far turn and finished evenly. SAINTE THERESE
raced in the three path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the four
path then flattened stride mid-stretch. GIMME KIMMY stalked the early pace off the rail then picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn off the rail but weakened leaving the turn.

NICE ADVENTURE chased the early pace inside then eased to the three path rounding the turn, took the lead at the eighth pole, raced clear in the upper
stretch and held on under steady urging. COLETTE'S SPIRIT chased the leaders through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four path and finished
well while gaining on the winner. HIDE chased the pace inside and finished evenly. BARRACUDA chased the pace and rounded the turn about the four path
but showed little more. NO SUGAR NO CREAM tapered to the inside to set the pace but was caught at the furlong pole and weakened. MY MISS
AQUARIUS lacked speed.

CREEKMORE raced with the early pace three wide then contested the edge two deep on the turn, dug in from the head of the lane and dueled clear later
yards. DESTRUCTION was hustled along between horses and dueled at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, then reluctantly ceded inside the
sixteenth pole. THE NAMES BILLY gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn two deep and just lasted for third. BARNSTORM broke
through prior the start and angled to the outside to give chase, left the turn widest and finished well; just missing third. A IS FOR ARTIST broke through the
gate prior the start then pressured the pace inside, but, steadied at the rail leaving the five sixteenths pole and weakened the final furlong. CHUCK'S
DREAM gave chase well off the rail and rounded the turn about the four path.

KING MAURO stalked the early pace then challenged at the three quarter pole, took the lead at the three eighths and moved clear past the five sixteenths,
then widened on the far turn and was steadily handled down the lane. THE IRON BANK settled back off the rail then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole,
raced in the five path of the turn, took over second toward the sixteenth pole and held on. CANTAKEITANYMORE raced off the pace toward the inside, bid
nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and was gaining on second. ONCE MORE EH hesitated slightly leaving the gate and
rounded the opening turn about the five path, saved ground into the second turn then bid only mildly before flattening stride. GLAD MOON (GER) raced off
the pace toward the inside then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, though, flattened stride in the four path of the far turn. AWESOME FU
quickly took the lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was met at even terms nearing the three quarter pole then came under pressure at the seven
sixteenths, gave chase from the three eighths but dropped back past the five sixteenths and weakened in the lane. EL EMANUEL was through after a half
mile.

FENDER BABY accelerated to the front past the half mile pole and rated the pace, came under pressure midway on the far turn and was mostly under a
vigorous hand ride through the lane. HONORABLE LILLY chased the pace inside, rounded the turn off the rail then dueled through the lane for second.
MISS TSCHETTER gave chase toward the inside and raced at the rail on the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. MATTYICE raced well
back outside, rounded the turn about the six path and was carried further out leaving the turn. JUNA chased the pace then flattened stride at the rail
rounding the turn. LADY REBEL gave chase about the three path and was never a factor. ONE ODD STORY chased the pace through the backstretch,
weakened in the four path of the turn then drifted into the lane.

BUNGALOW saved ground off the pace then bid leaving the three eighths pole, closed to the lead three wide approaching the head of the lane, dueled clear
mid-stretch and widened the final sixteenth. DIONYSUS' CHALICE angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the five
sixteenths pole, was headed toward the top of the lane, dropped back mid-stretch and held on for second. CATONSVILLE angled in to stalk the pace about
the three path then picked up the chase from the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and was gaining on the runner-up in an even
finish. CENT COMM hesitated in the gate and broke awkwardly then was sluggish into stride, raced well off the pace outside leaving the first turn, bid toward
the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and finished well while gaining on third. KATMAN QUICK veered sharply in leaving the gate
then steadied off heels into the first turn, raced well off the pace into the backstretch and showed only mild response. JEWEL HEIST rounded the first turn
about the five path and was not a factor. POPLAR AVENUE lunged at the break and rounded the opening turn about the four path, raced just off the pace
leaving the first turn then faded into the far turn. ENASOIT raced off the pace in the four and five paths and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
SAVAGERY took quick control and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole and held well with steady
handling. NEGRONI UP settled off the pace inside then bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled for second at the rail rounding the far turn but couldn't
improve on the winner. TALENT SCOUT raced off the pace about the three path then bid approaching the three eighths pole, contested two deep on the
turn but ceded in the stretch duel for second. AFFIX saved ground off the pace then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but flattened stride
leaving the far turn. AWESOME AGENDA rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled outside into the backstretch, bid only mildly then raced
in the four path of the far turn. CARTER'S RUN dropped back from the early pace and raced in the five path the opening turn, left the turn outside and
showed little response. GIO LEMON saved ground. CASHTON PEAK and MARCH TO MY TUNE were not factors. HARASAN stalked the pace about the
three path then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but faded past the three eighths.
