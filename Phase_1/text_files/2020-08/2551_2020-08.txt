Footnotes
OZETTE hit the gate leaving it, raced on the outside up the backstretch, began a wide move passing the three eighths pole, entered the stretch from the
three path, kicked clear from there and was kept to the task to the wire. SENSE OF SELF brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, pressed the
pace on the outside early, raced in the two path around the turn and chased the winner home in the stretch. MY SWEET PAYNTER raced inside at the back
of the pack early, saved ground around the turn, and rallied up the rail in the final furlong. TRULY'S SPIRIT stalked the frontrunners on the inside through
the opening quarter of a mile, swung out to find racing room on the turn, entered the stretch from the four path and gained ground on the outside in late
stretch. LAURA ATTACK bumped with the horses to either side of her leaving the gate, raced outside while off the pace up the backstretch, navigated the
turn from the three path and was outfinished late. ASHLEYSDREAM bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field on
the inside up the backstretch and around the turn and tired in the stretch. WELL HELLO YOU lugged out leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside up
the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and made no bid. BETTER THAN PEARLS trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn while still racing at the back of the pack and was never a factor.

Footnotes
UNSCATHED was bumped in the opening strides but was soon pushed to the lead, set a pressured pace from the eleven sixteenths, edged to a better
defined lead into the clubhouse turn, saved ground through the bend, remained well clear into the final furlong as KEEP ATTACKING began to weaken, saw
his lead diminish in the late stages as OUR THOMAS came rolling but still held safe while ridden out. OUR THOMAS was grazed by GIRLOLAMO'GLORY
in the opening strides, soon trailed, was pushed along near the three eighths and began to take closer order, swung three wide into the stretch, improved
under a drive, finished fast in the final furlong but could not get to the leader in time. KEEP ATTACKING tracked the leading pair down the back straight and
in the two path on the turn, chased the leader in upper stretch but could not gain on him, and flattened out in the final furlong. SUPRISE CAT came in and
grazed OUR THOMAS in the opening strides, chased two wide down the backstretch and in the four to five path on the turn, was urged for a three wide bid
near the five sixteenths, chased under a drive in the stretch, but ran only evenly in the final furlong. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY broke in and bumped
UNSCATHED, chased inside SUPRISE CAT at the rear of the main group, continued in the three path around the bend, turned for home under a drive
inside of horses, but offered no bid. DEMAND RANSOM broke sharply, pressed outside of UNSCATHED past the eleven sixteenths, stalked two wide past
the half mile pole, began to fade from the three eighths, and was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
ORCUS led the field while saving ground the entire way around the oval, opened up entering the stretch and was never threatened, proving to be much the
best. JUSTENUFFTUFF raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the
two path and chased the winner home, holding of a late closer to save the place. RICH E Z saved ground around the first turn, raced on the inside in the
middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and gained ground in late stretch. CALL THE COLONEL raced in the two
path around the first turn, came up the backstretch between horses in the middle of the pack, saved ground around the second turn and finished evenly.
GOLDEN GIFT trailed the field from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, improved position slightly on the far turn while racing in the
two path, and came up empty in the stretch. COLOMBARD raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside in the
middle of the pack, angled in to save ground around the far turn and faded in the stretch. FORT DIXIE raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked
the leader on the outside entering the backstretch, began to drop back approaching the half mile pole, raced in the three path around the far turn, and was
not a contender from that point on. MAGIC MUSKETIER trailed the field from the two path around the first turn, raced up the backstretch still at the back of
the pack, saved ground around the far turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
LIVING VICARIOUSLY was sent for speed inside, vied inside of DIVE DEEP through the turn and into the lane, was bumped by DIVE DEEP near the three
sixteenths but continued on the lead, went to a drive approaching the furlong mark, came out just past the furlong mark and bumped DIVE DEEP, kept on
stubbornly and held. VINCENT WILLIAM tracked outside of DIVE DEEP in the opening furlong, tracked the leading pair three wide around the bend, went to
a drive near the three sixteenths, rallied gamely outside of LIVING VICARIOUSLY but missed. MR. TIP was slow into stride, settled at the rear, angled three
wide near the three eighths and was pushed along, took closer order into upper stretch, rallied four wide in the final furlong and missed. WILD WES settled
two wide toward the rear down the backstretch and through the turn, came into the lane between horses in the rear group, went to a drive approaching the
furlong pole, rallied with interest three wide between horses but was outkicked. DIVE DEEP tracked the leader inside of VINCENT WILLIAM early, vied
outside of LIVING VICARIOUSLY on the turn and into the lane, came in and bumped that foe near the three sixteenths, was bumped when that same
opponent came out just past the furlong pole, and folded. RED HOT DEVIL settled toward the rear early inside of WILD WES, was pushed along while
saving ground around the bend, and offered no rally.

Footnotes
CITALI raced outside up towards the back of the pack up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, launched his serious bid between horses
near the three sixteenths pole and dueled for the victory in the final furlong, managing to keep his head in front. TRE LEE DIVINE hit the gate at the break,
trailed the field through the early going, swung out on the turn and entered the stretch from the four path, launched a bid passing the three sixteenths pole
and dueled gamely with the eventual winner in late stretch, but could not go by. BEAR TRAPPE raced outside early, navigated the turn from the three path,
began a bid passing the three eighths pole and finished evenly in the stretch while drifting out mildly. GENTLEMAN RICHIE bumped with the horse to his
inside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, continued to show the way to the furlong pole, and
weakened in the final sixteenth of a mile. SHOBIZ STAR tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, entered
the stretch between horses and was outfinished in final furlong. WORKINGFORALIVING raced inside early, began to move up on the rail around the turn,
entered the stretch in striking position and flattened out from there. MR D'S WAY raced inside through the opening furlong, veered out sharply approaching
the three quarters pole, was corrected by her rider in time to stay on the backstretch, moved up slightly on the outside through the next half mile, raced in
the two path around the turn and faded in the stretch. TIMINGISEVERYTHING bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace up
the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.

LAUNCH AWAY settled at the rear, rallied up the inside into the far turn, swung out past the three eighths, raced three wide into the lane, improved through
horses, swung four wide midstretch, came in near the furlong mark while continuing to rally, led with a sixteenth of a mile remaining and bounded clear.
SUNDEREYA settled near the rear of the main pack inside of SHOWIT, improved two wide between horses into the far turn, kept on between horses into
the lane, continued to run on under a drive but proved no match for the winner. SHOWIT settled two wide near the rear, was pushed along for a four wide
bid into the far turn and responded with a rally, was driven three wide into the lane, sustained her rally three wide in the lane although herded when
LAUNCH AWAY came in midstretch, and missed the place. NORTHERN ALLIANCE raced between horses in the tracking flight into the first turn but
advanced to track the leader, took closer order to stalk the pace down the backstretch, bid outside the leader on the far turn, led with a quarter mile
remaining, cleared past the three sixteenths, but was caught at the sixteenth and flattened out late. ANTALYA broke a step slow and was bumped in the
opening strides, settled in second last, took closer order two wide into the far turn and improved around horses through that bend, but could not sustain her
rally in the lane. PEACE LOVE BREAD tracked inside horses, continued in range while saving ground through the far turn, but lacked the needed kick in the
lane. HAVE THE FACTS cleared to the lead, took pressure from NORTHERN ALLIANCE to her outside around the far turn, was headed at the quarter,
briefly vied inside but faded inside from the three sixteenths. JUKEBOX MONEY hopped at the start, hit the gate, chased midfield three wide, came into the
lane between horses, and came up empty. DIRT ROAD PRINCESS raced three wide in the tracking flight into the first turn, settled to chase the leading pair
two wide, and stopped near the half mile mark. OBJECTIONS WERE LODGED BY THE RIDERS OF BOTH SUNDEREYA AND SHOWIT AGAINST THE
RIDER OF LAUNCH AWAY, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE, DETERMINING
THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION.

Footnotes
DELICIOUS PURSUIT dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was ridden
out to the wire. BELLE BREZING was bumped mildly by the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced between horses early, navigated the turn from the
two path, was forced out mildly when WILLOW MOON drifted out in the stretch, and improved position in the final furlong. JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL raced
between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn between horses, began a bid approaching the three sixteenths pole and was
gaining ground in late stretch. SWEET PRAYERS chased the leaders up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, tried to go with the frontrunners
down the stretch but could not, and finished evenly. HONEY MUG raced inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn, and was
outkicked on the rail in the stretch. NO CACHA NA (CHI) trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a rolling bid nearing the
quarter pole and passed tiring horses in the stretch. MOON OVER CABO broke through the gate prior to the race, veered out and bumped with the horse to
her outside at the actual break, raced outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and came up empty in the stretch. WILLOW MOON
dueled for the lead on the outside through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the turn and tired while drifting out slightly in the stretch. TIZ
TRISH raced between horses early, saved ground around the turn, ran into traffic near the three eighths pole, was steadied slightly and then made no bid in
the stretch. TIZALADYBUG raced outside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
FIRST MASAMUNE grazed the gate, chased well behind the leading and tracking flights through the first turn and into the backstretch, took closer order
outside of DO WITH PRIDE approaching the far turn, was urged for a rally into that bend and circled four to five wide, swept past the rest of his foes four
wide in upper stretch, and drove clear. FADE AWAY settled near the rear inside of DOLLAR BLUE, improved two wide on the far turn, showed good kick
between horses in the lane but proved no match for the winner. DOLLAR BLUE settled near the rear two wide, raced three wide into the far turn and four
wide past the five sixteenths, was urged three wide into the lane, rallied three to four wide, but was outfinished for the place. ANGELINO soon trailed, was
driven to improve outside of MIAS MOONBEAM on the far turn, swung into the lane in the five path, and made good belated improvement outside.
SCARLET CITY tracked the pace outside of READTHECLIFFNOTES, took closer order on the leading pair in tandem with READTHECLIFFNOTES through
the far turn, was urged three wide into the lane and responded with a rally, could not match FIRST MASAMUNE and flattened in the final furlong.
READTHECLIFFNOTES tracked the leading pair inside of SCARLET CITY, took closer order around the far turn while still racing inside that foe, raced into
the lane between horses and flattened out. DO WITH PRIDE chased inside of ANTRIM'S GIANT through the clubhouse turn, inched forward inside of
FIRST MASAMUNE near the half mile mark, was urged inside through the far turn and into the lane, took up briefly past the furlong mark, was taken three
wide after that for room, and chased on. MIAS MOONBEAM hopped slightly at the start, chased three wide through the clubhouse turn and two wide down
the backstretch, raced between horses into the second turn, continued near the rear around that bend, came into the lane under a drive inside and passed
tiring horses. BUNSTER attended the pace outside of PENALTY SHOT through the clubhouse turn, engaged with increased pressure down the backstretch,
vied outside the pacesetter through the far turn and into upper stretch, but was swamped past the three sixteenths and weakened. ANTRIM'S GIANT
grazed the gate, chased between horses through the first turn and two wide down the backstretch, was urged three wide on the far turn but mustered no bid.
PENALTY SHOT hustled up inside, set the pace while taking pressure from BUNSTER, vied inside that foe through the far turn and into upper stretch, was
swarmed past the three sixteenths, came up empty and was allowed to fade.
