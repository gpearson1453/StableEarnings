SHE BE FIRE N ICE quickly cleared and took command along the inside, stayed along the rail through backstretch and turn, responded to urging in stretch
and held well. MISS NAPPER TANDY chased leader in between rivals on the backside, entered turn in the two path, entered stretch in the two path,
responded to urging and kept to task holding second. ANNITASHEAVEN tracked rivals in the three path on the backside, coaxed for run entering turn three
wide, entered stretch in the four path, made a bid early in the stretch and flattened out late in the lane. PRIVATE KITTY chased leader inside of rivals on the
backside, stayed along the inside entering turn, lost some ground through the turn and entered stretch along the inside, responded moderately to urging and
improved position in the lane. MERGIE TROID lacked speed along the inside, stayed in the inside through the turn, asked for run in the stretch, responded
well making up ground in between rivals and galloped out in front. CHARMING WEEKEND chased leader three wide on the backside, entered turn two
wide, entered stretch in the three path, lacked needed response in the lane and weakened. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION THE RACE WAS HAND
