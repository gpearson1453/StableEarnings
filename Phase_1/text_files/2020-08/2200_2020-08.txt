HIDDEN RULER dueled for the lead three to two wide, forged an advantage inside of the furlong pole, then prevailed over his inner game foe in the final
stages. I'M CORFU dueled for the lead inside of foes, dug in gamely in upper stretch inside of HIDDEN RULER, but yielded in the final stages. HERE
COMES DOC saved ground while off of the pace, then stayed on past tired foes in the lane, but failed to threaten the leaders. ONE FOR RICHIE dueled
between horses early on, but failed to keep pace with those foes into the turn, then kept on between foes through the while hanging on his left lead.
COURTING A KISS was caught in the five path around the turn, and failed to make an impact. SCORING was bumped by an inner foe at the start,
prompted the pace four wide, but weakened approaching the furlong pole. WILD BEHAVIOR broke outwards and bumped a foe at the start, got rank behind
rivals early on, then raced off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
MY GOLDEN DIABLO established a clear lead early on while staying a path off of the inner rail, the held his margin through midstretch under driving
pressure before kicking away in the late stages. CRITIC rallied four wide around the turn to produce a bid for the lead outside of the leader turning for home,
but was repelled approaching the furlong pole, then just held place from his inner game rival in the late stages. PAPAJUDGY was forwardly placed four
wide, bid for the lead three wide between horses turning for home, but was outkicked by his outer foe while failing to keep pace with his inner foe in upper
stretch, then kept on gamely through the late stages to just miss reclaiming place at the wire. SEMINOLE JUSTICE bumped with an inner foe at the start,
pressed two wide early on, but weakened to midpack between horses into the turn, shifted to the four to five path turning for home, then passed tired foes
for a minor reward. BOOM FIVE THOUSAND was forwardly placed three wide between horses, but weakened turning for home. ROYAL LEIGE bumped an
outer foe at the start, chased the pace along the inside, but weakened. WYMAN trailed throughout and was no factor.

Footnotes
BETCHA stalked along the inside before shifting to the four path into the turn, rallied four wide in upper stretch as the leader kicked away, forged place at
the furlong pole, sustained her drive through the late stages, and drove past the leader inside the final sixteenth. SANDY'S NEWSGIRL set the pace along
the inside, shook loose turning for home while shifting to the three path, built a clear advantage and held it to the sixteenth pole, but was caught in the final
stages. ELUSIVE JUSTICE saved ground while far off of the pace, shifted off of the rail turning for home, then to the four path at the furlong pole, then
produced a mild late kick and was gaining on the leaders while hanging on her left lead. REAL DEPUTEE brushed with an outer foe at the start, pressed the
pace two wide, but failed to keep pace approaching the quarter pole, then kept on through the lane for a minor reward. HELP ME OUT brushed with an
inner foe at the start, chased three wide, bid turning for home, but proved no match for the leader in upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. FIRST
SQUADRON failed to factor after tracking from the three to five path. LETSBEGREATAGAIN had a slow start and never got involved. GOT SPIRIT saved
ground while off of the pace, but weakened.

Footnotes
CORNBREAD KINGDOM was unhurried along the inside, came into the backstretch trailing under a tight hold, shifted out and rallied four wide around the
far turn, produced a bid approaching the quarter pole, drew off in upper stretch, and widened under driving pressure. FIFTYFIVE STRONG stalked along the
inside down the backstretch, came under a drive into the far turn, then kept on late along the rail to secure place in deep stretch. A. K. SAFARI was
forwardly placed three wide, produced a bid three wide at the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by a wider foe turning for home, then kept on for a
minor reward. EAGLES PALACE dueled for the lead along the inside, but weakened in upper stretch. IT'S MANDATORY trailed in the four path around the
turns, and was never involved. BUY IT dueled for the lead two wide early on, but weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole, stopped, and was
eased through the lane.
