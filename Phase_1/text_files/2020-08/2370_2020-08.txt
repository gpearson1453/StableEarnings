Footnotes
LT. BONURA up close early from the outside, dueled through the turn, shook loose entering the drive and was much the best while under steady urging.
BIG MERRILL well placed from the outside, advanced through the turn, responded but was no match while just up for the place. GOTIGER SPECIAL
stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded but just missed the place. VISIONS OF GOLD pressed the early
pace from the inside, responded entering the drive and rallied but too late. CAJUNS GOLDEN POND dueled from between foes early, battled through the
turn then faded in the drive. LIT A SHUCK was no real factor. GREY SLOAN was no threat. VELVET RIDGE dueled from the inside and faded. SHADY
GRADY had a steady fade. OUR HALF FIRST was never close. BRITHASGOLDENCENTS was no menace.
