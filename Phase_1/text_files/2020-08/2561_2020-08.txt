Footnotes
I'M FOCUSED vied 2 path, cleared head of stretch, kept to task. THIS IS THE MOMENT vied inside, held place. VISIONS OF JOY mid field, good effort.
OFF THE GRID taken back, steady gain, best of rest. SMARTASATAK chased leaders, weakened. JOHN'S QUEST mid pack, lacked late response.
LOOKIECOOKIE broke slow, never a factor.
