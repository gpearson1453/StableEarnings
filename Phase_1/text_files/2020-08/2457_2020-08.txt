DIRTY DANGLE broke alertly, led for a few strides then dropped back to stalk, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn, launched a determined drive, had
command in the final furlong and held under steady pressure. SOUPER MUNNINGS forced the pace briefly and was taken back, was hustled four-wide late
turn then rallied outside was gaining late. IN MY OPINION drifted out a bit leaving the gate, forced the pace into the turn, pressured the leader two and
three-wide through the turn, challenged in the final furlong but was outkicked and evened out in deep stretch. AMALFI SKY settled off the pace and moved
to the rail on the turn, the rail opened at the top of the stretch then late between foes. GRAPEVINE broke a step slowly then moved up the rail to take the
lead, set a pressured pace from the rail, shook clear briefly at the top of the stretch, was passed in the final furlong and gave way. HIGH SOCIETY GIRL
stalked the pace three-wide, dropped back in the stretch and failed to menace. ROSA'S SOUL broke outward, stalked the pace from the rail, was hustled on

Footnotes
SOCIETY JOE bumped with SCHIMMEL at the start, raced in striking range, closed two-wide on the far turn, bid in the final furlong and drove clear. CARL
G set a pressured pace, drew clear late backstretch, led the way to the stretch, was passed in the final furlong but held place. KEEP YOUR WORD showed
brief speed then settled in mid pack, was hustled five then four-wide on the far turn and chased to the end. VIRGIL CAINE broke outward and settled off the
pace, closed to mid pack on the backstretch, was checked along the rail entering the far turn and chased to the end. SCHIMMEL got away a step slowly,
bumped with SOCIETY JOE and was pinched back, stalked the pace, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. CELTIC CHIEF bobbled leaving the gate
and settled off the pace, was hustled on the far turn but never reached contention. I'VE PAID MY DUES was pinched back at the start and settled off the
pace, rode the rail on the far turn but lacked a rally. NEW DEAL broke outward, forced the pace to late backstretch, stalked, then was taken back mid turn
and lacked a closing response. A CLAIM OF FOUL WAS LODGED BY THE RIDER ON SCHIMMEL AGAINST KEEP YOUR WORD AND SOCIETY JOE
FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE BREAK BUT THE CLAIMS WERE DISALLOWED. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUN THROUGH THE FAR TURN
CONCERNING VIRGIL CAINE AND SOCIETY JOE (WHEN VIRGIL CAINE WAS CHECKED) WHICH ALSO LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

Footnotes
SWEEPIN HARD sat in mid pack early on hold, fell back to second last on the turn when the field bunched up, began to angle out at the quarter pole and
shifted into the six or seven path down the stretch, passing them all while widest in the final sixteenth, drawing away late. OWEN'S SOUPER MOON sat off
the pace early, commenced a four to five wide move into the far turn, bid for the front in upper stretch and had a brief lead outside the sixteenth pole but
failed to hold off the winner, clearly no match for that rival's closing burst. FINAL ECLIPSE settled in mid pack, moved into range behind a wall of leaders
three to four wide at the quarter pole, looking for a seam in the five path in upper stretch and shifting in when none developed, got to the rail in the final
sixteenth and ran in evenly for the show spot. DADDYPLAYSTHEBLUES broke a half step slow and was near the rear early, moved up wide down the
backstretch, circled four wide around the far turn to be four wide vying for the front turning for home, got a brief lead in upper stretch but hung in the final
furlong. BLUE SNOW led quickly, was stalked and pressed down the backstretch, stayed battling inside four other rivals late on the far turn and gave in
grudgingly down the lane. PERSONAL JOURNEY chased along the inside, was behind a five horse wall late on the turn, searched for a seam as they
turned for home and did close with interest when clear of traffic inside the final furlong. MUSKOKA STORM settled into a nice rail stalking trip, seemingly
had run while awaiting room as the field turned for home, but could only respond mildly when a clear path opened up in the final furlong. ST. PADDY'S
DADDY was four to three wide stalking around the opening turn, came up to three wide press the front in the far turn, was steadied while still in contention
(but tiring) by the eighth pole and lost positions late. UNION APPRECIATION was five wide into the first turn, moved up to challenge the leader down the
backside and stayed on battling in the five horse confrontation near the quarter pole, steadying when a rival shifted in near the eighth pole when running in
place, tiring from his tough trip. BIG TIME GIZMO steadied at the back of the pack into the first turn, came four wide at the rear of the field into the far turn
and did not reach contention. THERE WAS A GENERAL STEWARD'S INQUIRY INTO THE RUN DOWN THE STRETCH WITH REGARDS TO THE THE
THIRD PLACE FINISHER, FINAL ECLIPSE. AFTER REVIEW, FINAL ECLIPSE WAS PLACED NINTH FOR INTERFERING WITH ST. PADDY'S DADDY
AND UNION APPRECIATION NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE.

Footnotes
THE BOSS FACTOR led early, set a reserved pace, quickened late turn and held sway under a drive. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) raced in mid pack, rode the
rail on the turn, rallied outside and gained steadily to the end. KITTEN'S BOY, also in mid pack, came two and three-wide through the turn, chased into the
stretch and finished under a determined drive. FLASHYMEISTER settled off the pace, came two-wide through the turn then rallied between foes. NOW WE
ARE NINE stalked the pace, raced two to four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch then flattened out in the final 16th. UNO CHAMP settled off the
pace, angled from the rail to three-wide through the turn, tipped out further at the top of the stretch and rallied gamely outside. BLOCKBUSTER broke
outward and settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, bumped ZOOMER MUSIC mid stretch and finished gamely in vain. OTHER THINGS EQUAL
pressed the pace, closed outside the leader briefly on the turn, chased into the stretch and backed away. ZOOMER MUSIC was taken back early and
settled in mid pack, came two-wide through the turn, was bumped mid stretch and was through. SPRING EDITION broke alertly but outward, was rank on
the backstretch, settled and was hustled four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, was determined but unable to gain late. JAMMIN STILL, in range,
saved ground on the turn, chased into the stretch then tired a furlong out. TRULY ELITE, in range early, dropped back three and four-wide to mid turn,
chased into the stretch but lacked a closing response.

HE'S A GIZMO was herded by Kish Point at the start and settled off the pace, closed fast two to four-wide on the turn, swept to the lead upper stretch and
widened under a hand ride.. RED ASTAIRE stalked the pace, closed late backstretch, chased two-wide on the turn and finished under a determined drive.
KING OF THE RING settled off the pace, was checked hard on the far turn, closed into the stretch and finished gamely. MYCRAZYLIFE had early speed but
failed to gain a sole lead, raced prominently three-wide, drew clear into the top of the stretch, was passed quickly and gave way. PICKHIMUPSUP raced
forwardly two-wide, dueled through the far turn, was headed near the top of the stretch and tired. KYSLIOS'S JUSTICE settled well off the pace, was
hustled from the rail and two-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. KISH POINT broke outward and herded HE'S A GIZMO, raced in mid pack,
closed late backstretch and was hustled angling in from the four-path to two-wide on the far turn but failed to threaten. MR. TODD was prominent early,

Footnotes
SOUPER ESCAPE had a nice open gap trip behind the two leaders, bid three wide midway on the turn for the front, stuck her head in front by the quarter
pole and battled a rival into submission by the eighth pole, holding a safe margin to the wire. PAINTING settled off the pace along the rail, rallied inside on
the turn and angled out to the three path turning for home, split rivals inside the eighth pole and closed best late to nail the place spot on the wire. AMALFI
COAST came from off the pace early to advance three to four wide on the turn into a menacing position, had dead aim on the leaders at the eighth pole but
her rally stalled in the final seventy yards, picked up for the place position on the wire. ANOTHER TIME was in mid pack early, rallied in behind the leaders
between rivals at the quarter pole but was outkicked down the lane, settling for a minor award. SISTER PEACOCK led quickly before allowing a rival along
the inside to go, stalked that one and bid for the front inside the winner midway on the turn, stayed game still inside the winner to the eighth pole but wilted
from that point. CHARMAINE'S MIA settled near the rear down the backstretch while under a hold, came two to four wide into contention by the quarter pole
but her rally stalled in the final furlong. MISS MOSAIC chased inside while on hold, advanced into traffic behind the leaders late turn, was shuffled to last at
the top of the stretch and seemed to lose interest with all the trouble. GAMBLE'S CANDY sped up the inside to lead early, was headed by mid turn and
retreated in the stretch.

ROSE'S VISION raced in mid pack, closed two-wide on the turn, rallied determinedly, swept to the lead a 16th out and finished under a hand ride.
WEDGEWOOD, in mid pack early, rode the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch but ran into traffic upper stretch and when finally clear in the late stages
posted a strong late surge to get up for second. STRIKE ME DOWN bumped with PERFECT SPEIGHTY at the outset, settled in range, closed three and
four-wide on the turn, bumped RECONFIGURE upper stretch then rallied gamely. GRAY'S FABLE dueled, edged clear mid backstretch, set a pressured
pace, shook clear into the stretch, was joined by PERFECT SPEIGHTY mid stretch but both were passed with a 16th to run. RECONFIGURE stalked the
pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn, was bumped upper stretch then finished all out. PERFECT SPEIGHTY bumped with a rival at the start, dueled
to mid backstretch then forced the pace, chased into the stretch, bid mid stretch, was passed a 16th out and gave way. SOUPER STONEHENGE stalked
the pace from the rail, chased in the stretch but evened out in the final 16th. SOLIDIFY settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then
rallied to no avail. THOR'S ROCKET raced in mid pack, chased three and four-wide on the turn then flattened out in the final furlong.
