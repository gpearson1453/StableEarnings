GAME DAY PLAY pressed the early pace, gained command around the far turn, dug in gamely inside the sixteenth pole while racing along the inside and
prevailed under strong encouragement. SUPER STOCK stalked the pace, raced four wide into the lane and finished gamely to just miss. RED N WILD vied
for the lead along the inside and weakened in the drive. BIZZY LEGS was allowed to settle early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough.
GOLEM veered out sharply at the break, moved up five wide at the eighth pole and made a mild late gain. CAPTAIN COMEBACK settled off the early pace,
raced four wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. I'M ROMEO stalked the pace and tired along the inside. STASIS was allowed to settle in the early
stages, raced three deep in the stretch and never threatened. PERFECTURE dropped back early, saved ground and never was a factor. RED LIAISON
failed to have a response.

HIGH SECURITY pressed the early pace and drew off in the stretch to be well clear under strong handling. BAGPIPES stalked the pace, raced three wide
at the eighth pole and finished second best. PODEROSO EQUS stalked the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid.
UNBROKEN SONG was allowed to settle early, raced two deep in the stretch and had no late response. JESSICAS ARCH was unhurried early, raced four
wide into the upper stretch and had no rally. FROSTED BLING set all the pace and gave way. CRAZY IVAN broke awkwardly at the start, raced towards the
inside around the far turn through the stretch and never was a factor. BANKROLL BEN dropped back early, raced five deep into the lane and never
threatened. SEATTLE THUNDER failed to have a response.

five wide through the stretch and had not enough late. TURN A DEAF EAR settled towards the back of the pack early on, saved ground and had no final
winning bid. FLASH N GO tracked the leader while racing two wide and tired. LIGHTNING BUG stalked the pace and weakened while racing three deep.

DUST EM stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide through the stretch and drove clear. HE'S A BOMB vied for the early lead while racing two
wide and finished second best. BIG ONE stalked the early pace, raced towards the inside throughout and had no final winning bid. RIANTE SKY was off
slowly, moved up five wide past the eighth pole and made a mild late gain. LASTCALLFORALCOHOL settled off the early pace, raced three wide and failed
to have a response. RUNAWAYPOINT dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. RUSH THE COLORS pressed the
pace from the inside and tired. HARRY raced far back and never threatened.
