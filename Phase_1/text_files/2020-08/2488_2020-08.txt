Footnotes
WHISKY MAN was bumped at the start, allowed to settle, closed with a burst of speed through the stretch and was along in time under a hand ride. TIME
TO SHOOT made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace off the rail, shook clear at the top of the stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of
the winner. IN THE GAME vied for the lead along the inside and went evenly. MURTAGH hopped at the start, rushed up to press the pace before a quarter,
had speed into the stretch then was used up. HIS WILL BE DONE bore in bumping the winner at the start and was no threat. BUTTON BOX had speed into
the turn then folded. HINES TREASURE was never close, eased in upper stretch, jogged to the wire and was walked off.
