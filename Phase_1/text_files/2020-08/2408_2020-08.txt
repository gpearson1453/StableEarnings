KING MAURO broke out a bit and lightly bumped CAPE LOOKOUT, settled off the pace two wide between rivals, made progress inside around the far turn,
tipped out nearing the eighth pole, closed two wide, was up inside of the sixteenth pole and drove clear. CAPE LOOKOUT was lightly bumped at the start
and again just after, dueled at the rail for a half, drew clear around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, led past the sixteenth pole but offered
little resistance to the winner from there. PEP TALKING chased the pace three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn and flattened out in the lane.
RELENTLESS STRIKE was bumped after the start, dueled two wide and tired around the far turn. KOPP CAT saved ground and failed to menace. ACCESS

Footnotes
KENTUCKY DANCER set a clear pace in the two path, drifted out in upper stretch and held firm under a drive. VONDA prompted the winner in the three
path, angled in when that foe drifted in upper stretch, narrowed the gap without seriously threatening and was clearly second best. CORY'S CUTIE broke
slowly, saved ground off the pace around the first turn, advanced outside, angled back in near the three-sixteenths pole and rallied inside for the show.
FACEY'S SISTER saved ground well back, advanced three wide around the far turn, came seven wide into the lane and rallied belatedly widest. SAINTE
THERESE settled off the pace three wide, bid four wide around the far turn and weakened in the drive. CASTLEINTHEMEADOW chased the top two while
saving ground and lacked a rally. NOT A SECRET played no factor while racing three and four wide. SILENT NOTION chased the pace two wide and came
up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF WINDSOR was bumped just after the start, set a pressured pace along the rail, dueled inside of JAXBRADENRISHI from the quarter pole, was
narrowly behind from the three-sixteenths pole to deep stretch, battled back inside and prevailed in a game effort. JAXBRADENRISHI stalked the pace two
wide, bid two wide nearing the quarter pole, led outside of the winner around most of the far turn and through much of the stretch but was outdueled late.
KATMAN QUICK was bumped just after the start, chased the pace two and three wide and was one-paced in the lane. LASS MOMENT failed to menace
while racing two wide. MERRY MERRY MOJO lagged well back inside, swung five wide nearing the lane and never threatened. SILVER CASTLE came in
and bumped foes repeatedly in the early stages, pressed the pace two wide and tired after a half. GLEN'S CASTLE was bumped between foes at the start
and pinched back when bumped again a few strides later, raced two and three wide and made little impact. BLIMEY LIMEY was bounced around then
squeezed back at the start and trailed in the two path.

SINGINDOWNTHELANE pressed the pace two wide, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear around the far turn, held clear past the
sixteenth pole and just lasted under a strong drive. COURTESY SHUFFLE settled off the contested pace inside, advanced three wide around the far turn,
closed outside and just missed. MACKENZIE'S STAR lacked early speed while racing two and three wide and was along for the show. BABY JEAN set a
pressured pace inside of the winner and weakened around the far turn. DYNAMIC UNION failed to menace while saving ground. KIM'S PET played no
factor while racing three and four wide. SHANNA'S GRAY chased the pace two wide and was through after a half.

OUT OF CENTS stalked the pace two wide, bid three wide into the far turn, seized command near the three-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. K
TOWN BRASS set the pace a bit off the rail, fought on inside of the winner past the eighth pole, was no match for that foe in the final sixteenth pole but held
well to preserve the place. TRIPLE BAD was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, advanced inside around the far turn, bid inside of the top two
in upper stretch but was no match in the final furlong. MEAN TO AMEND was pinched back at the start, raced two and three wide and lacked the needed
rally. CAYENNE CREEK stalked the pace two wide, bid between the top two finishers nearing the far turn but weakened around the bend. CAPTAIN
CHARITABLE was bumped at the start, trailed inside, swung out in uppers stretch and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
STROLLNTOTHEBANK broke a bit slowly, steadied near the half-mile pole, angled out soon after, circled six wide around the turn, closed with a rush and
was up on the wire. MIGHTY CROSSING was bumped at the start, set the pace two wide, drew clear around the turn and led until the final stride. CEDAR
RUN'S FIRE was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide, steadily gained through the lane but was outkicked. THUNDER PUNCH was fractious
behind the starting gate, raced two and three wide and had a mild rally between. BADS LIL LADY was off a bit slow, raced two wide and rallied belatedly.
TINA'S SONG had early speed inside, checked entering the turn and faded inside. GWEN'S GAL went evenly three wide. WILD CORK played no factor
while racing four wide. ROAD TO GREATNESS was outrun while racing two wide. SISTER HOLLIE was outrun inside.
