Footnotes
TRUST AND OBEY was bumped by a horse and bobbled at the start, pressed outside the leader to the turn, vied briefly, led entering the stretch and was
game to stay clear of a challenger down the lane. SPURS ADDICTION tracked in third, moved up in the five path on the turn, challenged the winner at the
head of the stretch but was rebuffed while running on to keep the place spot. DIAL MR PROSPECTOR was the inside speed early, vied with the winner on
the turn and leveled out at the eighth pole. GIVE ME A CHANCE was last into the turn, came widest into the stretch, was floated out wider by a foe and
improved position late. R HOUDINI bumped a horse at the start, raced evenly and lost position late. ONE PROUD FLAG was bumped and away slow at the
start, steadily advanced, took the five path on the turn and drifted wide in the stretch. ROCK'N ROLL MUSIC was bumped at the start, chased inside from
mid pack, moved outside on the turn and backed up in the stretch.

CONGRUITY good position to the half, stayed on to turn, roused to clear in the stretch and held sway to the wire. DRAGSTER stumbled from gate,
regrouped in good position, three wide run to rally along for the place spot. BOLD PROPHET speed from inside to far turn with nothing left and settled for
show. AULD CUP slow start, raced along backstretch, swung widest into stretch and leveled off in the drive. HONDO GUSTO had a tardy start and failed to
reach contention. EMPEROR'S GOLD good speed to far turn, gave way readily and dropped back. MATCH PLAY never a threat.

Footnotes
TOMORRA sat in perfect position inside to far turn, waited for an opening to the quarter pole, got one at the three sixteenths pole and charged off in the
stretch when clear. NOBLE FEVER good speed on rail to far turn, came off inside, winner got through and settled for second while game to the wire.
ALEXANDRA THIRTEEN raced a three wide trip, stayed on in the stretch and just missed the show spot. MACHINE GUN MERRY had an awkward start,
lagged back to far turn, shifted five wide,past quarter pole and gained late. PLEA raced outside on backstretch and far turn while plugging along stretch.
MOMOS HUMOR good speed to the half, weakened to run evenly from that point. MAYAPRETTY inside trip with nothing left from quarter pole, faded.
COOL CELESTE awkward start, never menaced. JUST FINE BY ME never a contender. CHANNEL VICTORY stayed close outside to quarter pole, wilted
in the drive. SHEZA MIRACLE BABY raced a wide trip throughout, never a menace.

LOVE YOU GOODBYE had an awkward start, was quick to the lead, got clear by mid turn and kept a good lead while being shown the whip late.
COUNTRY MOON chased close up inside, took the four path on the turn, was no match and second best. CARIBBEAN SKY was well back in third, ran from
off the rail on the turn and was no match for the top pair. READY SET GO was never close, took the four path in the turn and held the same position down
the stretch. PAIG'S SONG was no threat. ATLANTIS ROSE trailed.

the show spot. SCAPE raced evenly with no late response when needed in the drive. BURSTING IN AIR broke well, sulked back into the first turn and
improved position in the late going. B SKY HIGH no speed to far turn and improved position only in the stretch on the the rail. SWEET EVY GRACE saved
ground to far turn with nothing left and backed up form that point. TICKET TO RICHES good position to the half, backed up quickly from there. VORTICES
was reluctant to load first time, ran off during saddle repair to the winner pre start and was through after half with a good excuse.
