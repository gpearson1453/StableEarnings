CASH LIMIT broke alertly but was outsprinted early, raced three wide to the stretch then rallied smartly in the drive and won going away. HEY SEQUOIA
had no speed, raced off the rail to the stretch then was not threat to the winner but bested the others. LADIES MAN set the pace two wide to the stretch,
responded to mid stretch then could not stall the winner and was collared late for the place. DYNAMITE RIDE stalked the pace to the turn, was fanned four
wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. GRAY GEM was showing speed while between horses then became rank, threw his
head and was uncomfortable to the turn, remained between foes to the stretch then tired in the final furlong. PAPA PAGOSA chased the pace inside to the
turn, got outrun to the stretch and weakened.

stubbornly. REGINELLA was outsprinted and settled to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then finished steadily but too late. CREATIVE

Footnotes
HAWK HILL was sent for speed and took the lead, set the pace off the rail to the stretch then responded to kick away to mid stretch and held driving.
SARGENT LENZINI hustled along early to prompt the winner three wide to the stretch, got outkicked by that one to mid stretch then held off AUBURN
STREAK for the place. AUBURN STREAK was used early to press the action from the rail to the stretch then was outfinished and just saved the show
dough. GALOPIN GOURMET had no speed, saved ground to the stretch then could not make an impact in the drive. DYNAMIC DUO trailed to the turn, was
three wide then swung out five deep into the stretch but lacked a closing response. CAMZUL got outsprinted to the turn, was four wide to the stretch but
also did not threaten. CAPACITOR chased the winner two then three wide to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
SARNI flashed the best speed, set the pace under pressure to the second turn, responded when set down in the drive and held determinedly. UNION
LEADER had no speed, trailed to the second turn, saved ground then shifted out in upper stretch and finished willingly for second. PROSPICIENCE also
had no speed, settled to the half, circled five wide on the second turn and was closing ground late. POUR ON THE COLE was unhurried mid pack to the
second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. DIRT ROAD RED prompted the wfinner tdo the second turn, was
two wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then tired. SINGLE BARREL was chasing the pace to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch but
weakened in the drive. I WILL YEAH (IRE) was outrun to the backstretch, settled to the second turn then was pushed out to the four path to the stretch and
lacked a late bid. PRAISE LOUDLY was four wide stalking the winner to the second turn, tried to rally three wide but gave way after six furlongs.

Footnotes
WHOA NESSIE broke alertly and went right to the front, set all the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded and held driving. C I M SWEET pressed
the winner throughout while two wide but had to settle for the place. EUPHEMISTIC trailed to the second turn, swung out four wide into the stretch but could
not offer the needed late response while not switching leads in the drive. LEA'S REWARD hesitated in the gate and was about three lengths last coming
out, chased to the second turn, shifted off the rail mid turn but came up empty in the drive. GIRLSINTHEOFFICE tracked the pace to the second turn, raced
three wide to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong.
