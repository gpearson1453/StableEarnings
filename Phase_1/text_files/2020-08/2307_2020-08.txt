Footnotes
BIZ MAKER settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, came four wide into the lane, swept to command in
midstretch and powered clear under a drive. SHAKIN' THAT SUGAR stalked the pace inside, waited for room between foes rounding the far turn, split rivals
in upper stretch, bid inside of the winner in midstretch and was no match late. SPEAK ENGLISH was rank early while racing two wide in midpack, steadied
midway around the far turn, angled three wide near the three-eighths and rallied for the show. DREAMINOFDASIES saved ground in range, steadied near
the three-sixteenths pole, angled out in midstretch and lacked a rally. SPENCE tracked the pace three wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole but
weakened in the final furlong. GRAND ENTRADA never threatened while racing two and three wide. HER JUSTICE was outrun inside. MOLLY BOLTS
played no factor while racing two wide. GYPSY GIRL stalked the pace two wide, took the lead entering the far turn and tired in the drive. NANIE'S
TREASURE set the pace along the rail and gave way entering the far turn. SUDDENLYLASTSUMMER was outrun while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
UNAQUOI rated along the rail behind the pace, swung out coming out of turn, charged down the middle of track to prevail ridden out. FIRST WAVE held a
stalking position on the rail, rallied and finished with good energy. PRECOCIOUS PEACH led from the break on the rail, weakened in the stretch. LOVE
BEACH closed for a late gain. ASPEN ROSE broke awkwardly and veered out, settled behind the field and was never a threat. DOMESTIC VIOLET
traveled four wide on the turn and was never a threat. GOLD AND STRIKE pressed the pace, went three wide on the turn, then tired.

Footnotes
STARLET LADY raced well back three wide early, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed widest and was up and clear late. DANCING TIL DUSK
stalked the pace two wide between foes, idled a bit while switching leads back and forth in upper stretch, took the lead near the sixteenth pole but was no
match for the winner in the late yards. TEA IN CHINA raced off the pace three and four wide, rallied through the lane and was just up for the show. BEE
WINGS set the pace along the rail, led to the sixteenth pole and weakened. NOT MY MONEY broke awkwardly, raced two wide in midpack around the first
turn, advanced inside down the backstretch, made strong progress at the at the rail around the far turn, loomed boldly in upper stretch and flattened out.
DISCRIMANATION saved ground to no avail. MAIDU was outrun inside. RUN BY was outrun while racing four wide. LISTENTOTHESTARS was rank at the
start and played no factor while racing four wide. LA GUATEMALTECA tracked the pace three wide, lost the whip nearing the lane and faded. TRINNI LOVE
saved ground and failed to menace. WAFT had brief speed three wide.
