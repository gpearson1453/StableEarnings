Footnotes
MARTINI SUE led early, set a reserved pace, was pressured on the turn, shook clear approaching the stretch then held sway under a drive. FINE LADY had
early speed but was taken back to stalk the pace entering the Clubhouse turn, saved ground, chased two-wide into the stretch, launched a determined drive
but hung late. MUNCH AND CRUNCH raced in mid pack from the second path, moved to the rail late turn and chased into the stretch, moved off the fence
a furlong out and finished gamely. PETITE AMIE got away slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the far turn but evened out in the
stretch. FOREST AT DAWN broke a step slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail through the far turn but never reached contention.
EZME'SGIRL was off slowly, closed on the first turn and stalked the pace into the backstretch, moved up and forced the issue on the far turn, chased into
the stretch and tired.

MY CANTATA stalked the pace, chased along the rail late turn, bid inside the leader a furlong out and drew clear then held HEART RUSH safe under a
drive. HEART RUSH stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide late turn, launched a determined drive andf gained steadily, but missed. BLONDE ATTITUDE
settled off the pace, raced along the rail and two-wide through the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and rallied gamely outside. BEAU'S BEAUTY
showed brief speed, was headed and pressed the pacesetter, chased two-wide on the turn, moved to the rail for the stretch run and finished gamely.
GIMBALA raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then finished evenly. RED ROLLIN was sent to the early lead, set a pressured
pace, shook clear into the turn but was collared a furlong out and gave way. DOLLY STORMY raced in mid pack along the rail, was hustled on the turn but
had no response in the stretch.

Footnotes
EIGHT SPEED moved to an early lead, set a pressured pace, drew clear into the turn, was set down upper stretch, widened, then held sway under a drive.
QUEEN LICIA broke slowly, forced the pace on the backstretch, stalked from the rail on the turn, was boxed in approaching the stretch but a path opened
along the fence and she finished gamely. DEA DEL CIELO broke outward, closed into the turn, stalked three-wide, chased into the stretch but evened out in
the late stages. WHAT'S THE RUSH stalked the pace, came two-wide through the turn then chased through the stretch. SHISHKA settled off the pace,
closed two and three-wide on the turn but failed to menace in the stretch. BYE BYE I'M GONE broke outward and settled off the pace, was hustled three
and four-wide on the turn, tipped out a bit at the top of the stretch but lacked a closing response. ELITE SPEED got away slowly and settled off the pace,
was hustled along the rail on the turn but had no response in the stretch.

Footnotes
VICTOR'S DESTINY dueled early, gained a narrow lead, was engaged mid turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch and held sway under a drive. ICE
CHALLENGE was steadied at the start, stalked the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. KINLEE'S SONG was
rated at the rear of the pack then was steadied in tight quarters early turn, closed and stalked from the rail, was blocked approaching the top of the stretch
but found a path to the outside and rallied gamely. LILLZ NOT CRYING broke outward and settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn
then rallied gamely outside. PAPA TONY broke inward and was steadied, stalked the pace, closed two and three-wide late turn but evened out in mid
stretch. NORTHERN SOLUTION dueled briefly then forced the pace into the turn, rebid mid turn but was cleared at the top of the stretch and faded. RADIO
NOWHERE settled in mid pack, raced three and four-wide through the turn but flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
BIG MAMBA raced in mid pack, closed three and four-wide late turn, rallied and got by late under a hand ride. ROSE RING stalked the pace, closed three
then two-wide late turn, inherited the lead upper stretch then failed to hold the winner late. SNIPPY forced the pace, took the lead at the 1/2 mile pole,
moved clear, drifted out late turn, lost the lead at the top of the stretch then chased to the end. MISGUIDED PASSION settled off the pace, chased
three-wide late turn then finished gamely. COURT TIME settled in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn but never reached
contention. I LOOK INCREDIBLE stalked early, dropped back and saved ground from mid pack on the turn but lacked a rally. BONNIE SCOT broke in the
air, set the pace in hand, was headed at the 1/2 mile pole, dropped back and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
MARTEN RIVER took the lead quickly and held a clear advantage setting a pedestrian pace throughout, but needed the wire late, drifting about as his
margin of victory was diminishing in the final yards. GORGEOUS KITTEN trailed early, commenced a rally to get into mid pack on the turn, shifted out into
the eight path turning for home and closed resolutely to just miss late. LETTHEBIGHOSSROLL was under heavy restraint in the early slow going, settled in
behind a wall around the turn, looked for a seam before diving inside in upper stretch, then lost his path when the top two came together in the final seventy
yards, an unlucky third. CERRADO trailed the field into the stretch, angled out in mid stretch and closed best of all in the final sixteenth for a minor award.
KING AND HIS COURT off the pace early, came two to four wide around the turn and lost his path to the eventual place finisher turning for home, then
rallied smartly in the final sixteenth while wide. CANMORE sat a nice rail trip in behind the soft pace leader, had dead aim on that one when angling out in
upper stretch but had no closing response when asked. BE VEWY VEWY QUIET stalked the leader three wide throughout, loomed late turn but faded out in
the final furlong. BADJEROS BOY along the rail and off the pace early, rallied into a contending spot turning for home but stalled, falling back the final
eighth. CHIRICAHUA SIGNAL stalked the winner throughout, bid late on the turn but was repelled, losing ground down the lane. HIT THE TICKET chased
four wide from mid pack, moved up while still widest on the turn, then backed up down the stretch.

Footnotes
MUSKOKA STORM dueled, shook clear early turn, set the pace then was all out to hold in the late stages. STOP THE HUMBUG settled off the pace, closed
two to four-wide on the turn, launched a determined drive and was gaining then hung late. BORN TO BE KING raced in mid pack, chased angling in from
five-wide to three-wide through the turn, loomed dangerous at the top of the stretch, chased, but evened out late. CREATIVE FORCE, pinched back at the
outset, settled off the pace, closed along the rail and two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely in vain. GIVE ME AN EYE stalked
the pace, was hustled along the rail and two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the final furlong. BIG TIME GIZMO settled in mid
pack, chased hard four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. FAST THINKING settled well off the early pace, closed fast two to four-wide late turn
and finished gamely but did not menace. TALL WATER stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and
flattened out. HANDSOME GUY dueled on the backstretch, was headed at the turn, dropped back along the rail and lacked a rally. STERLING ICE stalked
early, was hustled three-wide but began to drop back late turn and was through. LIQUID LOUIE stalked early, dropped back on the turn and lacked a closing
response.
