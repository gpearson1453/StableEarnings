Footnotes
SCREEN STAR well placed and outside, held position three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain, edged head
and held. CHANNEL FURY stalked the pace on the outside, held position through the turn, bid three wide outside of that one, then could not threaten the
winner late and held the place safe. CLAW exchanged bumps at the start, rated close up and off the rail, saved ground on the two path through the turn,
angled in and came through inside the leader into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick, while gaining the show. DRUNKEN LOVE sprinted to a clear
lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. DR PARKER ran evenly. DYNABLUE broke a
step slowly and ran greenly. KICK IT CHARLIE was no factor. SQUIRREL bumped at the start, was a brief factor.

THE DRAKE allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off late. SIR
SWAYSALOT never far back, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, took command, then
was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. ONE REAL COWBOY allowed to settle, moved up four and five wide through the second turn, bid
five wide into the lane and closed well for the show. TEXAS GIANT allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid three wide into the
lane and got up for a share. MR MCGUERTY passed tiring rivals. MIKE MIKE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged
through the second turn, then faded the final furlong. EBULLIENCE mid pack, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch
and faded in the drive. SAINT ADORABLE well placed and outside, lost some ground three and four wide through the second turn, then had no rally.
HURRY POTTER stalked the pace on the outside and faded through the second turn.

TEXAS MUSIC sprinted to a long lead soon after the start, then lasted under steady pressure. DANCE OR STROLL mid pack, looped up three and four
wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and missed. TIZ RED WINE well placed and outside, held position on the two path
through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, weakened late and held the show. ABBEY'S SNOW WHITE allowed to settle,saved ground through the turn,
came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then closed well late to gain a share. BEYONDELLE mid pack, moved up four and five wide through the turn,
fanned widest into the stretch and had a mild gain. BRING IT ON HOME tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide
into the lane and evened out. PURSUIT OF LUTE ran evenly. SIERRA SARAH showed little. COZZENE'S CAT was never involved.

for the place. WANT tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, made a steady
gain and missed. BEN OF THE BUSH rated outside the leader, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the
stretch, weakened late and held a share. BIG RIG passed tiring rivals. MIDNIGHTONBROADWAY mid pack, gained position three wide through the second
