HEAD KITTEN was hustled early, roused from the inside on the turn and with a bid in mid stretch drew clear. GIDEON'S SWORD tracked the leaders from
the outside and was a factor on the turn but with the lead from the five path in mid stretch was outgunned. WALKINAROUNDMONEY set the pace and had
the lead on the turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and outfinished. STONEAWAY was up close and forced the pace on the turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch was all out. WHATSONEMORE was in touch and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat. HONORABLE GIBSON was
off the pace and raced evenly on the turn but had no impact. SUNKA WAKAN was in range early but chased on the turn and failed to fire. LORD PIETRO
was well back and showed little in a dull effort.

PHIL IN THE BLANK was up close, a factor on the turn and with the lead from the five path in mid stretch just lasted. BRADY O'BRADY was unhurried
early, moved up on the turn and with a bid in mid stretch just missed. MARRIAGE COUNSELOR was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the
six path at the top of the stretch rallied late. GRIN N' BEAR was away alertly and had a slim lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch
gave way. NUPOGODI had no speed and was roused from the inside on the turn but had no late kick. CRUMLIN EXPRESS was hustled early and forced
the pace on the turn but came up empty.

SAN NICOLA THUNDER set the pace, had the lead on the far turn and with a clear lead through the stretch prevailed. LEONARD'S BAY was unhurried
early, had a mild gain on the far turn and finished well. SOPHISTICATION stalked the early leader and was a factor on the far turn but from the five path at
the top of the stretch leveled off. ROCKBARTON was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no rally.
BUTTERFLY STRIKE was in mid pack and roused on the far turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no response.
CHIEFROLL'NTHUNDER was well back and closed the gap on the far turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch had no impact. QUALITY BREW
was in range but chased on the far turn and failed to fire. BEEN WAITING was off the pace, showed little and was never in contention.

showed speed and set the pace, had the lead on the turn but with a clear lead in mid stretch failed to hold. MOLLYTARA was in touch, roused on the turn
and held show. FLATOUTONAMISSION was in range and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. MISS
PATRIOT was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. READY AND WILLING broke
poorly and showed little while outrun. PIRANO showed no speed and raced evenly on the turn but was not a factor.

FLECK was unhurried early, moved up on the far turn, rallied through the stretch and drew clear. SHEZTENTHEHARDWAY showed speed from the inside,
was a factor on the far turn and had the lead from the three path in mid stretch but was outgunned. JACK'S MEMORY was in range, had a good position on
the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for show. HANSEN'S GIRL was away alertly and had a clear lead on the far turn but
weakened through the stretch. SPEEDING STARLET was in touch and raced evenly from the inside on the far turn but needed more. GLORIOUS
FREEDOM was off the pace and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch evened out. ANNIE O'SCHILLER was well
back and showed little in a dull effort. COURT REPORTER had no speed, trailed the field on the far turn and failed to fire.
