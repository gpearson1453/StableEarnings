close quarters between horses at the head of the stretch rallying once clear inside getting up for place. ZANGARVA slow early lost ground to upper stretch
responding to gain late in the seven path. CHEERFUL CHIMES prompted the pace ceding on the far turn weakening in the six path down the lane.
SLOWPOKE hustled on the outside pursued through the far turn weakening in the four path upper stretch. MY BLACK BEAUTY stalked close up through
the far turn saving ground to upper stretch tiring along the rail. SOPHIE RULES stalked the pace extending three deep into upper stretch tiring under a drive.
PRINCESS KIAH a step slow from the break was checked entering the first turn, stayed back after posing no menace. MOUNTAIN MELODIES a step slow
throughout played no factor. BEACH LADY folded up early.

GRADE was bumped and crowded early settling off the pace, swept up to put a head in front on the far turn drawing off the final eighth under modest urging.
EMPTY TALK prompted the pace dueling through the far turn ceding in upper stretch proving no match while securing place. DUBULL slow early gave a
mild rally on the far turn racing evenly down the lane at mid track. STOP THE PARADE crowded foe early, played no factor. PERFECT JOE stalked the
early pace weakening on the far turn giving way to upper stretch. MAVERICK'S ACE hustled for a half a mile was empty on the far turn. MY PEOPLE SING
pressed the early pace then wilted abruptly on the far turn.
