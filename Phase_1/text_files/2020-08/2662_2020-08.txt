Footnotes
MAXIM STRIDER bumped from the outside in the beginning, well placed behind the top pair, saved ground around the bend, angled out with a furlong to go,
closed in alongside the runner-up and proved best late. MAMBA QUEEN dueled for command with INVESTMENT GRADE into and around the bend and
into the stretch, cleared briefly past the eighth pole but could match the winner in the final sixteenth. JUDY WITH GRACE tracked the pace from the inside
to the stretch, asked at the eighth pole and rallied for the show. INVESTMENT GRADE dueled for command from the inside, weakened in the final furlong
and lost the show. ESPERER (FR) tracked three wide into the bend, angled out four wide and finished evenly late. KATE BOSS broke in and bumped rival
at the start, settled just off the pace early, went two wide and outside a rival into the lane and lacked a rally. DEL MAR FLASH forwardly placed off the
inside, took the turn three wide, bothered by the winner at the eighth pole and weakened. CALL SIGN FIFI off a bit slow to begin, raced two wide into the
bend then moved out into the three path and proved no menace. ASPEN AGAIN ducked in and steadied at the start, saved ground trailing the field and was
never a factor. HAND TIMED.

LAST FIRST KISS dueled from the inside then cleared rivals, inched away around the final bend, pressured by THIS TEA in the drive, lost command past
the eighth pole then came back at rival and edged foe in the final strides. THIS TEA settled off the inside, took aim three wide into the stretch, took a short
lead past the eighth pole, battled with LAST FIRST KISS in deep stretch and was outkicked in the closing moments. MISS MO' LICIOUS sprinted to the
front quickly from the gate, dueled for command from the outside then stalked the leader up the backstretch off the inside, raced outside a rival then three
wide into the stretch and bested the rest. KEEP DANCING reluctant to load, went four wide into the first turn then angled to the rail around the bend, stalked
the pace inside to the lane and weakened. OVERWHELMING LOVE trailed the field near the fence, angled out on the final turn and never threatened.

EAST RAND bumped leaving the gate, tracled mid-pack outside a rival then moved out three wide, angled out at the top of the lane, bumped by SEEKING
REFUGE mid-stretch and dug in late to best rival. SEEKING REFUGE broke out and bumped, angled out into the first turn, raced four wide on the
backstretch then bid three deep around the far turn, drifted out and bumped EAST RAND mid-stretch and finished gamely to the wire. BIG CITY BANE
raced near the inside then a bit off the rail trailed patiently into the far turn, traveled two wide into the stretch then angled out and produced a mild rally to
earn the show. HONOS MAN angled to the inside the moved out on the backstretch, came two wide into the stretch, angled out and summoned a mild late
bid. SHOW BUSINESS had early speed but was in a bit tight and steadied along the inside leaving the chute, pulled into the first turn, chased from the
inside to the lane, steadied in upper stretch, gained a clear path and finished willingly. HE'S LIKE VIOLENCE set the pace inside, met bids around the far
turn, fought back inside then weakened in the late stages. GO TIME stalked from the inside then moved a bit off the rail in the stretch and lacked a bid.
TROMADOR showed early speed three deep leaving the chute, checked between rivals first time in the stretch, stalked outside a rival then a bit off the rail,
crowded and checked at the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back along the inside and could not rally. FINAL FINAL raced outside rival early, altered out
around foe into the first turn, moved out four wide on the backstretch, steered back in some and went three wide into the lane and was never a factor.
SINGLE ME OUT up close outside the leader, bid between on the second turn and weakened in the drive. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
BIG HOOF DYNAMITE stumbled leaving the gate, stalked a bit off the rail, angled out upper stretch, rallied four wide and got up in time. ALVAARO off a bit
slow to begin, sped to the front and angled to the rail, led clear to the quarter pole, responded to urging and led through the drive but could not hold in the
final strides. SELF TAUGHT went three wide into the first turn then chased a bit off the rail, two wide around the second turn, challenged between foes in
the drive but could find more in deep stretch. KNIFES EDGE settled near the inside, steadied from the thirteen-sixteenths to the eleven-sixteenths, angled
out on the second turn then swung out into the stretch and showed late interest to earn a minor award. ZORICH tracked along the inside to the stretch and
never rallied. DEBT MONGER tracked off the rail then four wide on the backstretch, bid four then three wide on the second turn, lost whip approaching the
sixteenth pole and weakened in the drive. VODKA TWIST had early speed from the outside and went four wide into the first turn then dropped back to
chase off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and faded.

PALACE PRINCE stalked the pace two wide then angled in and bid inside near the five-sixteenths, took over shortly after, kicked clear into the stretch and
held off the late charge from the runner-up. K P D DAY tossed head and was off a bit slowly, pulled early then chased between rivals, angled in on the
second turn, lacked room upper stretch then angled out late, surged but could not get by. JUROR raced three wide into the first turn then moved four wide
on the backstretch, came three wide into the lane, bid but was outkicked by the top pair. MY INDY off slow from the inside, settled near the fence, saved
ground into the lane, angled out in the drive and closed well. TEMPLE SECRET stumbled badly at the start, unhurried a bit off the rail steadied off heels at
the quarter pole, then showed late effort through the final furlong. FULL DRAW tracked off the rail, two wide on the second turn and flattened in the stretch.
VEGAS MOON chased outside the lead, steadied at the three-eighths, went three wide into the lane and weakened. INFATUATE stalked the pace from the
inside, steadied near the half-mile marker, dropped back and weakened in the lane. SPANISH COUNT sped to the front and pulled early to the
nine-sixteenths pole, headed at the five-sixteenths, checked at the quarter pole and faded in the lane. HAND TIMED.

AFLEET DIVA stalked outside a rival, went three wide into the turn, exited in the two path, rallied steadily and reeled in the leader and edged foe under
right-handed urging. SEPTEMBER SECRET sped to the front from the inside, cleared at the half-mile marker, inched away then drifted in through the
stretch and was caught. REIGN OF FIRE broke well from the outside, stalked the pace off the inside, traveled four wide into the turn then moved down into
the three path, finished well in the final furlong and closed the gap on the top pair. EXCHANGE VOWS chased outside the leader, dropped back around the
bend, came out on the turn and had little left for the drive. FIREITUP angled to the inside, came out around the bend and never threatened.

leader again at the quarter pole, led past the eighth pole, battled to the wire and prevailed. MESSAGE bobbled at the start but recovered quickly and
sprinted to the front, pressed from the outside into the backstretch, inched away then challenged from the outside at the quarter pole, dueled with PROUD
EMMA through the lane, lost command past the eighth pole then dug in late and got up on the line. HANG A STAR tight between foes and steadied on the
first turn, tracked outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and finished a clear third. ZUSHA stalked near the fence, angled four wide around the far
turn, lugged out in upper stretch and never made an impact. SMILING SHIRLEE chased off the inside then pressed the pace outside the leader, lost ground

QUIET SECRETARY sped clear and angled to the rail, padded the lead up the backstretch, led clear into the drive, drifted out late and held well.
CONSTANTIA stalked outside a rival then a bit off the rail, came three wide into the stretch, drifted in past the eighth pole, steadied and floated out by
QUIET SECRETARY in deep stretch and kept on for second. JOURNAL ENTRY tracked from the inside, angled out a bit in the stretch and held the show.
LOOKIN SO LUCKY bumped leaving the gate, allowed to settle off the pace, angled to the inside, saved ground into the stretch and showed late effort to
earn a minor award. UNBREAKABLE chased along the inside to the lane, angled out in upper stretch and lacked a bid. I GIVE UP unhurried in the early
going near the inside, raced a bit off the rail then between runners, moved three wide, stayed off the rail into the lane and improved position. NAUGHTY
EVELYN broke in and bumped rival at the start, chased a bit off the rail and weakened in the lane. ALICIA'S PRIDE traveled near the back of the field while
off the inside, advanced four wide up the backstretch, came five wide into the lane and also weakened. M FAST settled outside a rival, three wide up the
backstretch, steered into the two path and faded. BRANDONS DANGER traveled mid-pack early, raced between foes into and around the far turn, came
two wide into the lane and had little left for the stretch. BIG MINX raced between early then three deep on the backstretch, angled in on the second turn and
tired. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH QUIET SECRETARY DID SHIFT OUT IN DEEP STRETCH IT DID NOT
COST CONSTANTIA A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING. HAND TIMED.
