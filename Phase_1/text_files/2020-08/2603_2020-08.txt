Footnotes
WEST FORK vied inside to the far turn then pulled away eagerly while ridden out to the finish. ACERE angled inside in the opening stages and closed well
while no match for the winner. RULES prompted the pace three wide and proved empty in the stretch. FINN'S POSSE lagged far behind inside then passed
fading rivals. WAR OF THE NORTH chased wide off the leaders, raced wider on the turn and gave way. GAME CHANGER dropped back after the start and
was always outrun. YES IT'S BONIFIDE was urged close up between rivals early and stopped abruptly. KING VICTORIA broke slowest and trailed losing
contact with his field. The race was delayed 15 minutes due to the presence of a fox in the infield.

THUNDERSHOOK pursued the loose pacesetter between foes early, bid into the stretch, collared the leader and eagerly drew off. EMPEROR JOHN lacked
speed, advanced near the inside, angled out in the lane, continued gamely but was outfinished. FIX ME A SANDWICH quickly took control, extended his
advantage without urging on the turn but shortened stride in the stretch. THREE PHASE trailed for half a mile then passed weakening rivals.
DROSSELMAGIC chased three wide down the backstretch and gave way. ASPHALT PAVING broke a bit awkwardly, rushed up inside and was finished by
the far turn. CANIFORM raced wide throughout and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
KNOCK OUT KID stalked the pacesetters outside, split foes in the stretch and edged ahead driving. I'M THIRSTY vied for the advantage inside, was briefly
clear into the stretch and continued gamely. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT raced just off the leaders wide and came up empty in the stretch. KENDYL
ELIZABETH dropped back early, advanced near the inside with some energy. VERRAZANO VITTORIA raced very wide on the turn and never threatened.
GIRL POWDER saved ground off the pace and was never a factor. MO TOWN KAT trailed for half a mile then passed fading rivals. MY CANDY FOREST
dropped back early and weakened sreadily. LA CANDELITA dueled outside to the quarter pole and stopped abruptly. MRS. CREWS raced within striking
range and gave way readily.

ENDUROS DIAMOND took the lead between, ran freely in front, maintained a long lead mid stretch, began to shorten stride and held on under confident
handling. PIGGYBANK came out at the start, saved ground, drifted out and bumped GOSLEY entering the stretch and was gaining. GOSLEY eased out on
the backstretch, was bumped entering the stretch. BEST START raced in the five path chasing and then tired. SHILOH LANE broke slowly, was far back in
a dull try. METALLIC TUNE stopped.

HELENE JACQUELINE quickly took control, widened in the stretch, was never menaced and remained safe while kept to mild urging. BROOKLYN
HEIGHTS saved ground to the quarter pole, angled wide and closed well while no threat. PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER broke sluggishly, moved wide on the
turn and held on for the show. BOOM BOOM GIRL broke slowly, saved ground throughout and lacked a solid rally. TELLMEYOURDREAMS pursued the
winner for half a mile and gave way. PALOMA GRIS dropped back early and was always outrun. OUR DIXIE BLUE lacked speed and weakened steadily. I
KNOW I CAN DANCE broke to the right, displayed poor action and lost contact with her field.

and then came out again soon after, saved ground, split foes near stretch, drifted out and was gaining. ATINA SALSA saved ground, drifted out a bit through
stretch and had no rally. STORMBEAM, fanned out leaving the gate, split rivals on the turn but had no rally. SIZZLING ROMA, jostled then forced out after
the start, saved ground and was not persevered with deep stretch. QUEEN OF SCHMOOZE raced wide chasing, drifted wider and tired. STREET APPEAL
