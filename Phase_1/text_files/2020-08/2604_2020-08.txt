Footnotes
S C ANGEL set a contested pace, edged clear the leaving turn and held sway in the stretch. VEGAS VIXEN chased while three wide, advanced on the turn
and rallied while four wide in the stretch. FOOLISH PRINCESS forced the pace, proved no match and stayed on. VIOLENT FIT saved ground and showed
some mild late interest. BINALLOVERDRINKEN never menaced. LIL' FANCY showed little. DRAMATIC ENTRANCE was bothered at the start and outrun.
