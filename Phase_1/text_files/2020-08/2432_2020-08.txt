Footnotes
MISS HELEN BACK cleared rivals approaching the quarter pole, held rail position entering the turn, expanded lead through the turn, responded well to hand
urging in the lane and easily drew off. ROBBERYINPROGRESS had to steady back in between rivals exiting the chute, stalked leaders in the three path on
the backside, coaxed for run on the turn while two wide, responded well to urging and finished willingly. BANJO GIRL settled behind the leaders off the rail,
entered turn two wide, entered stretch in the three path and responded steadily to urging. SHARE THE VISION forced out at the start by inside rival, angled
to rail on the backside, stayed along the rail through the turn and finished evenly in the stretch under steady urging. MONCHICHI tracked leaders two wide
on the backside, entered turn three wide and entered stretch in the two path, lacked needed response to launch any bid in the lane. BLUEGRASS BOOGIE
had rail position briefly on the backside, angle outside of leader passing the quarter pole, entered the turn two wide, drifted out into the four path in the
stretch, and tired under minor urging in the lane. BIT OF CACTUS ducked out at the start bumping rival, stayed in the 8 path while climbing early, entered
turn very wide in the 5path, lacked any bid in the stretch.
