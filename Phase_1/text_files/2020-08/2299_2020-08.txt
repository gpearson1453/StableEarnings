Footnotes
JASMINE BABY broke sharply and dictated terms from off the rail, moved in from about the two path to nearer the rail early on the turn on a clear
advantage, widened into upper stretch while drifting out a bit leaving the turn, cleared off in the lane while kept to task. BRANDISTYLED was bumped at the
break, encouraged forward inside early, switched out to the three path past the quarter pole and inside rivals, fought on gamely in the lane to capture the
place. ALL STEAMED UP was coaxed forward early, chased three to four wide into and on the turn, lost place. STORM TRACK chased from outside going
four to five wide on the turn, edged a bit closer late on that bend but offered no late kick. LAUGHING ROCKETT broke a step slowly, was urged along,
veered out a bit near the half-mile marker then corrected and shifted back in, went in the two path inside a rival on the turn and failed to rally. BEALRIGHT
GINGER was recalcitrant behind the gate, was forced out a bit near the half-mile marker, moved in to go three wide on the turn and failed to threaten.
CORNERSTONE bumped the inside rival at the start, lacked early speed, raced on or just off the rail on the turn and failed to menace. SKY TWO NINE
broke in and slightly steadied at the start, raced well off the inside in the four path through the turn and was not a threat.

CAUSING CHAOS tracked from inside rivals but off the fence, moved through inside the leader but in the two path to take the lead past the five-sixteenths,
moved clear into upper stretch when asked for more, held well under hand urging late. BENITO CHICO settled mid-pack, passed rivals on the turn going in
the two to three path, had too much to do but was clearly second best. BATTLEFIELDMARSHAL broke a half-step slowly and just a hair tight, began to
advance on the turn in the five path, continued in the lane to get up for show honors. ELUSIVE ACCOUNTING was close up in the early going while drifting
about just a bit up the backstretch, dropped back three to four wide on the turn and ran on in the stretch. IT'S MY BLISS set the pace from outside, went
three to four wide on the turn, weakened once headed. K W JAZZN switched out early, went three wide on the turn, passed tired rivals. PAIN FOR GAIN
was in the back half along the inside early, moved out three wide on the turn, failed to rally. GIVE IT AWAY broke outwardly a bit, chased briefly in the two
path into the turn then dropped back and came up empty. ALIMONY MAN went three to five wide on the turn and failed to threaten.

CRITICAL DECISION sped clear soon after the break and shifted in to dictate terms a bit off the rail, moved in to the two path entering the turn, had rivals
approach her flank nearing the quarter pole but re-asserted a clear advantage into upper stretch and held safe. NOBODY KNOWS WHO exchanged a light
bump at the start, had bumps on both sides near the four and one-half furlong area, was between runners off the leader, went three wide on the turn
chasing, just held place from SELL BABY SELL, who settled early, advanced on the rail into the turn, moved about three wide coming past the quarter pole,
gained inside but missed second. CRAVING YOU was bumped and steadied about the seven-sixteenths, went three wide into the turn moving out five
deep, ran on mildly. WE OUTTA HERE chased from inside just off the rail on the turn then weakened. INDIAN DIVA was bumped about the nine-sixteenths,
chased outside going four wide on the turn and came up empty. SPECIALYKINDACRAZY shifted in early, was forced into a foe about the seven-sixteenths,
continued in the three to four path on the turn and was not a threat. GHOSTLY TWO STEP bumped with a rival at the start, came out and bumped and
bothered foes about the nine-sixteenths then drifted in and bothered foes near the seven-sixteenths, began to drift out after that and was pulled up and
vanned off. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.
