Footnotes
MUSICAL MILLIE set all the pace from the inside and held gamely in the drive under strong handling. FORMULA stalked the pace, moved up four wide into
the stretch to finish second best. SNEAKY DIANNE pressed the leader while racing two wide and weakened a bit in the latter stages. MEISSEN was
allowed to settle early, raced towards the inside and had no final winning bid. LUCKY LIZA ANN was unhurried early, raced four wide into the upper stretch
and had no rally. GOSPEL MARGIE stalked the pace and tired while racing along the inside. COMBINE ROAD settled off the early pace and failed to
respond. ARKANSAS INVASION was slow early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. FLAT QUICK failed to sustain a bid.

BESTOW stalked the pace, moved up four wide into the lane and finished well to be clear late under steady handlling. OKIE LOGIC pressed the pace, raced
two wide throughout, led inside the eighth pole but couldn't match strides with the winner late and finished second best. ERIN'S CREATION was unhurried
early, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and made a mild late gain. THIRSTY LUCY settled off the early pace, raced six wide at the eighth pole and
had not enough in the drive. OLIVE COUNTY stalked the pace and tired while racing along the inside. ORPHAN ANGIE dropped back early, saved ground
and never was a factor. HIGH PROFILE set all the pace along the inside and gave way. SHADYNGRAY saved ground and never menaced.

BATTLE CHIC stalked the early pace, moved up two deep in the stretch and finished gamely to get up under all out pressure. AMERICA'S DARLING was
allowed to settle early, moved up four wide past the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire. WHEW was slow early, moved up six wide into the lane
and gained ground gamely late. TIZ THE STORM was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside around the far turn into the stretch, angled four wide
through the drive and had not enough. SASSY BOX broke awkwardly at the start, raced five wide at the eighth pole and had no late rally. NURSE LIST vied
for the early lead and weakened. SUPER BOWL GIRL settled off the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. KNOW
WHAT I MINA stalked the pace along the inside and tired. SKIRT WARNING failed to have a response. FINDING VALUE failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
CROWNED LEADER was slow in the early stages, moved up six wide at the eighth pole, finished gamely and got up in his final strides under all out
pressure. MONEY BARON vied for the early along the inside and finished gamely to just miss. BACKSTER BALL was unhurried early, raced four wide past
the quarter pole, continued to raced four deep in the drive and finished willingly to the wire. POPPY'S OATS settled off the early going, raced towards the
inside down the backstretch into the stretch, angled four wide in the lane and had not enough. NOW MIND YOU was hustled along early and weakened in
the latter stages. OKLAHOMA LINE was allowed to settle early, raced towards the inside and had no response. REAL EASY raced five wide into the upper
stretch and never was a factor. GOSPEL IKE was hustled along early and tired in the drive. DELTA SURPRISE stalked the early pace, raced five deep
through the lane and never was a factor. LETSPLAYAGAME vied for the early lead and tired readily.
