TYPHOON HARRY was unhurried to to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch then shifted out, rallied when set down and closed willingly to
prevail. MY MAN DRAYMOND had no speed, trailed three wide to the stretch then shifted out widest and finished well. SILVER FURY stalked the pace to
the second turn, was off the rail and engaged INDIAN HEAD NICKLE for the lead to the stretch, inched away to mid stretch but was outfinished. INDIAN
HEAD NICKLE had the best speed, set the pace from the rail to the second turn, resisted SILVER FURY to upper stretch but was weakening late. SPIDER
RICO stalked the pace to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. PEPPER SINGS tracked the pace to the half, circled
four wide on the second turn but gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
JIMMY D was outrun to the half, circled four wide on the second turn, rallied to engage for the lead in mid stretch then pushed clear driving. RIDEO chased
the leaders to the second turn, bid three wide on the second turn, rallied to take a brief lead to mid stretch then was no match for the winner. MAGIC RATE
also was chasing to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. COOL HUNTER had good speed,
was a pace factor to the second turn, stayed on to the stretch then weakened in the final furlong. ARCH ANTHEM was crowded by IRON ALEX and forced
to steady hard into the first turn, had no speed, closed the gap to the second turn but could not offer the needed late response. IRON ALEX was having
difficulty because of broken equipment into the first turn and caused ARCH ANTHEM to steady sharply, pulled up to the front, set the pace to the stretch
then gave way and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
ST. ANNIE'S INDY attended the pace outside the runnerup and two wide to the stretch, responded to inch away to mid stretch then cleared late.
BEAUTIFUL BABE contested the pace inside the winner, got outkicked to mid stretch but gamely bested BEE EINSTEIN for second. BEE EINSTEIN
stalked the top two from the rail to mid turn, shifted off the rail and made a run to mid stretch then was outfinished. LADY DAUPHINE broke a bit slow and
was hurried but lacked any speed, saved ground to the stretch but was not a threat. HEAT SEEKING LETA also was a step slow to begin, chased to the
turn, raced three wide while being outrun to the stretch then weakened. SHAWNEE PASS had no speed, raced two wide on the turn but was never a threat.
PLUMBRIDGE was green down the backstretch, raced off the rail while trailing to the stretch and also did not menace. SWEET HUSSAR tracked the pace
two then three wide to the stretch then tired.
