Footnotes
STOCK DEAL rushed through the lane for the first time to prompt the pace three wide, shifted two wide at the half mile pole, vied for the lead into and
around the far turn before forging an advantage turning for home, repelled BOURBON WISDOM's bid approaching the furlong pole, then fended off
ALEXANDER HAMILTON's rail rally through the final sixteenth. ALEXANDER HAMILTON stalked the pace along the inside, shifted off of the rail turning for
home to pass the tiring pace setter in upper stretch, then produced a mild kick to make a rail bid in the final stages, but was fended off. BOURBON
WISDOM steadily progressed from off of the pace three wide to a stalking position passing the half mile pole, tracked the leading pair around the far turn
before making a three wide bid for the lead turning for home, but hung on his left lead through the lane, flattened out through midstretch, then held show to
the wire. PATRIOT'S WAR tracked from midpack two wide and between horses around the first turn, took the second turn in the four path, but lacked a kick
between horses to make a bid. ALL REVVED UP trailed along the inside around the first turn, rallied in the five path around the far turn, but leveled off in
upper stretch without menacing. DA GOLD ROOM set the pace along the inside, but was headed by multiple foes turning for home, and was eased in upper
stretch. GARRICK saved ground far off fo the pace, but was no factor. WONTUBMYNEIGHBOR was caught four wide around the first turn while off of the
pace, then weakened at the seven sixteenths pole and was done early. LUCKY ROMEO stalked two wide early on, but weakened at the half mile pole,
quickly faded through the field into the far turn, was distanced and eased then galloped across the wire and walked off.
