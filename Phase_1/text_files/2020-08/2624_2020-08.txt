Footnotes
YES I'M EVIL was bumped at the start, waited in last to the far turn, made a quick four wide move to get into contention, steadily advanced to the front and
edged past the leaders in late stretch for the win. DREAMIN' OF MUNNY prompted the lead early, led going into the stretch, drifted out late and was all out
to hold second. KIMBERLEY DREAM raced off the pace a clear third, went three wide on the far turn to catch the leaders, battled down the stretch and was
all out to keep the show. SAMOA was bumped at the start, showed speed off the rail, lost the lead on the turn and faltered at the eighth pole. ABOGADA
was off the rail to the stretch, went five wide and did not gain. QUIET DAWN chased off the pace, was pushed on by the rider in the turn and lacked the
needed response.

ROSEFINCH had sharp inside speed to stay game throughout, dug in while holding off two challengers to the wire in a game effort. ANNMARIA pressed
winner to far turn, lost ground in the stretch while plugging along late while drifting out not able to get to winner while finishing on even terms for place.
PERSONAL SERVER was bumped start, lagged back to far turn while slowly grinding away from inside to finish on even terms for the place spot.
THIRSTYFORAMIRACLE raced evenly with no late run when needed. WHODUNNITANDRAN drifted out into first turn forcing LADY DENISSE to check up
and never in contention while far back. LADY DENISSE caught in tight soon after start and checked while never a menace and far back. FLEETWOOD
GRADUATE was through early and dropped far back.

COPPER TOWN led off the rail, quickened on the turn to put away a foe and was roused in the stretch to keep another foe at bay for the win. EVENT
DRIVEN was well back of the top pair early, gained good ground in the three path on the turn, fought a foe for place to the eighth pole and chased the
winner while no real threat. ACOSTA was bumped at the start, chased the winner up close, was urged for more on the turn, but couild not keep pace and
settled for show after battling a foe for a minor award. COURT AND SPARK was bumped at the start and no threat.

Footnotes
SCORSESE had an awkward start, attended the pace outside to the turn, took the lead there and stayed clear down the stretch, having enough to hold off a
foe late. PASSAGEWAY broke out and bumped a foe, recovered to get up close early, took the three path on the turn, fought a foe in the stretch for the
place spot but could not catch the winner. CANDY MOVER led early, angled off the rail to battle a foe for second down the lane but settled for show late.
JACK BE NIMBLE chased mid pack at the rail, lost ground on the turn but gained position in the stretch. COLLECTTHEMONEY was last and a bit green in
the stretch while improving position. FRANK THE TANK was bumped at the start, got within range, raced in the five path on the turn but stalled in late
stretch.

COWORKER just off leader to turn inside, saved ground with heavy urging in the final furlong to clear off. CARTER CAT had an awkward start, regrouped
quickly to have good position to turn, lost ground into stretch but kicked in late with a strong late surge for place. MY MAE DAY off slow, chased from the
turn, made a bid in the stretch but was badly outfinished for second right on the wire. SIETE LEGUAS good speed to the front battled hard into the stretch
but faltered in the late going. STAYONTHEGRIND quick from the gate and, secured the rail position throughout with no late response when needed. CAPE
MARCO DRIVE was never a real factor. SPECTACULARXCHANGE was a beat slow at the break while always far back and never in the hunt. NUMBERS
NEVER LIE had a steady fade. CADRON FLATS was off slow and raced far back at all calls while never a factor.

the win. UNITED STAND ranged up to take the lead mid turn and flattened out very late, settling for place. SAXON LORD vied briefly inside of two foes
nearing the turn, stayed on the rail in the stretch, led at the eighth pole but gave way late. SO CAUGHT UP IN U swerved out at the start, raced widest up
the backstretch in a compact field, rallied to get closer on the turn, came widest into the stretch and closed best. SWAMP RULER vied outside two foes
approaching the turn, kept on well to the stretch, lacked room nearing the eighth pole and faded. LAFLOWMYLAXBRO was never close but improved
position late. WILD ZAMBEZI was in the mix early, lost touch on the turn and improved position in the stretch. JOHN PAUL JONES vied between horses
early and faded on the turn.
