Footnotes
HOW IRONIC trailed the field early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane, blew past the leaders three wide near the sixteenth pole and
was going away in the final stages while geared down. OSAKA GIRL set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, clung to the slim lead near the
eighth pole and was no match for the winner in the final stages. JEN TAKE CHARGE stalked the pace early, moved closer to the leader while making a bid
from the five sixteenths pole to the eighth pole but hung in the final stages. BYE BYE BULLY'S tracked the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane, made
a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. ELLA BRILLA chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch
run. SISTER KITTEN chased the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane, altered out very wide late in the stretch with no gain in the late stages.
CHANNEL PRINCESS was bumped at the start, chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. AKOR was bumped
at the start and was no threat. HEY KITTEN was through after a half.

Footnotes
AMENDED was allowed to settle, took closer order through the second turn, shifted out for clear sailing, came to level terms entering the stretch, shook
clear inside the furlong marker and held safely. ELITE CLASS settled off of the inside, advanced toward the rail on the second bend, angled out for room in
upper stretch, kicked on well but was unable to reach the winner. FOOD AND WINE was close up three deep while reserved off the pace, moved up to
engage the leader midway through the second turn, but weakened slightly during the drive and settled for the minor award. CLEVELAND SIMPSON was
slow into stride, unhurried along rail, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, swung to the outside in the upper stretch, finished well but was unable to
bridge the gap. MR. AXEL was forwardly placed along the inside to the stretch, moved out a bit in the stretch, but flattened between rivals. JACK'S
ADVANTAGE was unhurried into stride, finished with a belated improvement but was never a threat. DRAW THE LINE contended outside to the second
turn and tired. CAN IMAGINE opened clear to dictate terms, was collared midway through the second turn, disputed the issue to the final furlong and
succumbed. INSTIGATED settled off the pace in hand, was within reach for six furlongs and dropped out.
