Footnotes
I AM THE BOSS sped to the front at the start, widened the advantage around the turn inside, and continued to draw off hand urged and shown the whip.
MISSING LINK steadied early inside PATRICK'S LASS, stayed on the rail rallying into the stretch, and finished willingly. PATRICK'S LASS moved off the
inside to the three-path near the quarter-pole, and lacked a solid bid. TANTALIZING GAL bumped with MISSING LINK at the start, chased inside to the top
of the stretch, and weakened shifting to the two-path. SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER chased outside for three furlongs, and tired. MANGROVE MAMMA hit
the left side of the gate solidly at the start, raced wide and was outrun. MERMAID'S TEAR saved ground and failed to menace. TONALA was always outrun.
TABERNACLE broke slowly and showed little. BLAZING MISS JOJO was finished early three wide.

Footnotes
NATIONALIST pressed the early pace inside, moved through to challenge for command between horses midway on the turn, took over from COOL
STANCE and drew clear going comfortably outside the quarter-pole, and widened under pressure. CAPTURED LIGHT was never far back, bid three wide
around the turn, could not go with NATIONALIST after six furlongs and ran on second best. NEW YORK COMMANDER bumped with DARESCA entering
the turn, moved out for the drive and lacked a rally. IRISH THUNDER was up with the leaders exiting the chute, dropped back to trail before completing a
half-mile, and went by faders on the far outside late. COOL STANCE set the early pace in the two-path, moved inside coming under fire from the first two
finishers, and gave way. DARESCA bumped with NEW YORK COMMANDER and steadied out of tight quarters between that one and CAPTURED LIGHT
past the seven-sixteenths, and dropped out of it.

Footnotes
AERODYNAMIC found a good spot in early striking range, ranged up to challenge four wide after completing six furlongs, took over outside NOBLE MARIA
through upper stretch under a drive, and was geared down the last sixteenth of a mile. NOBLE MARIA broke in bumping LITTLE BIT GOOD and was slow
to begin, took the first turn four wide, advanced three wide through the middle stages, bid between horses in the three-path at the top of the stretch, got
outkicked inside the winner through the furlong grounds, and saved the place. LIL BIT DANGEROUS lagged well back early, went three to four wide around
the far turn, and rallied willingly. LITTLE BIT GOOD got bumped by NOBLE MARIA at the start and was slow into stride, came three wide off the far turn and
rallied mildly between horses. TELL ME MAUX saved ground outrun to the far turn, swung wide for the drive and found her best stride belatedly on the far
outside. TAILADIOS saved ground losing position through the run up the backstretch, steadied and got shuffled back further early on the far turn, had the
three-path into the lane and improved mildly through the late stages. WILD ABOUT THIS stayed close early inside, came off the rail putting in a mild run
turning for home, but was outkicked past the eighth-pole. DINNER AT FIVE was four wide contesting the pace into the first turn, cleared inside with the lead
after a quarter-mile, faced a host of challengers after six furlongs, and folded up. MI KARLITA was outrun throughout. MILLEFIORI saved ground early at
the back, moved out four wide and remained outrun. RED KITTEN prompted the pace outside DINNER AT FIVE, lodged a brief bid between horses after six
furlongs, and faltered. OURHANDSOMEGAL showed early speed three wide, and was through before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
HERO TIGER stalked outside ATTHEPEARLYGATES early while keeping DECKOLOGY bottled up to his inside, ran by the pacesetter to take over readily
after a half-mile, drew clear through upper stretch and held sway late under a drive. LONDON WEREWOLF settled within range early three wide, shifted
further out into the stretch and stayed on his left lead rallying into second. DECKOLOGY followed behind the leader while kept in by HERO TIGER on the
turn, moved out for clearance at the top of the lane, and lacked a solid final response just inside the runner-up. SAINT LARNED broke in and took the worst
of a bump with RED NATION at the start, lagged well back for a half, moved out for the drive and rallied mildly on his left lead. BEAU TRACE angled five
wide off the far turn, and lacked a solid closing response. ATTHEPEARLYGATES set the early pace inside, got overhauled by the winner outside the
quarter-pole, and gave way. FREDDY SOTO hit the right side of the gate and bobbled at the start, and stayed far back. KING'S CASTLE broke slowly and
was outrun three wide. RED NATION received a bump from SAINT LARNED at the start, stopped around the turn four wide, and jogged in.

Footnotes
HOPONTHEBUSGUS was unhurried off a contested early pace, moved swiftly to take over four wide approaching the top of the stretch, shifted in drawing
well clear in upper stretch, and was driving to a sixteenth out before cruising in. COLONELS DAUGHTER lagged far back early, took closer order after six
furlongs, angled six or seven wide into the stretch, and rallied outside YAKO to take second late. YAKO was outrun to the far turn, came three wide rallying
into second approaching mid stretch, and was outkicked for that spot. TROPICALITY broke slowly and was far back early, angled five or six wide off the far
turn and improved past tired horses. LA INCONDICIONAL was isolated off the dueling leaders for a half-mile, ranged up after six furlongs briefly looming a
threat three wide, got out-moved by the winner approaching the stretch, and flattened out. SPICY NELLY steadied at the start coming away last, circled five
wide into the lane and went by faders. VINYARDNINA saved ground, moved closer after six furlongs but lacked a final response. DIXIE PRINCESS was
outrun for six furlongs, cut the corner into the stretch and could not gain. SASSY JUSTICE was hard used dueling inside LILLIE'S HEAT for six furlongs, and
faltered. LILLIE'S HEAT dueled outside SASSY JUSTICE for six furlongs, and had nothing left. FINAL FLURRY was far back throughout.

Footnotes
AVANT GARDE pressed the early pace, took over three wide with five-sixteenths remaining, shifted in drawing clear and was kept to a drive. BLESSED
JOURNEY was outrun early, moved out three then four wide advancing after six furlongs, and rallied outside for the place. LIKE YOU bobbled slightly
leaving the chute, stayed close to the stretch three wide, and weakened. SAINT BENEVOLENCE went along near the two-path to the stretch, lacked room
behind LIKE YOU and BLESSED JOURNEY outside the sixteenth-pole, and finished on his own courage. REBELDE pressed GENGHIS from outside early,
bid between horses midway on the turn, and faded after six furlongs. TONS OF GOLD moved out three then four wide on the turn, and could not reach
contention. GENGHIS set a pressured early pace, and faded steadily after five furlongs. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF SAINT BENEVOLENCE
AGAINST BLESSED JOURNEY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
KUNAL got clipped from behind by BACANO coming off the first turn while pressing EARTHQUAKE from outside, took over and moved inside before
completing a half-mile, settled into the stretch well in command, veered out sharply from left-hand pressure a sixteenth out impeding VERDICT IS IN, and
had enough to hang on. VERDICT IS IN raced three then four wide for six furlongs, rallied outside through the lane, got tangled up behind KUNAL and
bobbled as that one came over in front of him late, and just held second while being gathered up. ATAKAN pursued KUNAL from outside into the turn, was
under a drive before completing six furlongs, moved inside for the drive and ran on with good courage. KEEPSAKEKITTEN saved ground outrun early,
steadied on the rail near the three-eighths, moved out for the drive and found his best stride too late. KID DRAMA lacked room behind EXATLON and
checked entering the first turn, came three wide past the quarter-pole and improved outside without threatening. EARTHQUAKE led early inside,
relinquished the advantage to KUNAL up the backstretch, and ran on without threatening. BACANO clipped heels and stumbled after running up behind
KUNAL leaving the first turn, stayed on the chase three wide to the stretch, and faded in the final furlong. BEINFUN was in tight alongside KID DRAMA
heading into the first turn, raced well back to the stretch, and bumped with SHANGHAI MOON while trying to get out in the stretch. SHANGHAI MOON
broke in the air spotting the field two or three lengths, raced far back four to five wide to the stretch, and bumped with BEINFUN while out of contention.
EXATLON came in entering the first turn putting KID DRAMA in tight, saved ground and was through after six furlongs. MR. CESCO was four wide on the
first turn, and retired early. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF VERDICT IS IN AGAINST KUNAL, THE
LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST POSITION AND PLACED SECOND FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH.
