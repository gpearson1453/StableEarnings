early pace, raced towards the inside throughout and was no match for the winner. SEBA'S DANCER stalked the leader while racing along the inside and
had no late response through the drive. SPEARED was allowed to settle early, raced four wide just past the eighth pole and never was a factor. TALKING
ZIP stalked the pace along the inside and tired. R H SMOAKEM dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.

LOOKTHEOTHERWAY stalked the pace while raced along the inside down the backstretch, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and finished well to get
up under strong urging. DARLIN ROSIE pressed the early pace, gained command around the far turn, led past the sixteenth pole but couldn't hold off the
winner in the final stages to finish second best. CHOLLA was slow early, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. CHAINMAIL settled
off the early pace, raced four deep through the lane and never was a factor. CRAZY SEXY MUNNY failed to have a response. OF NOTE set all the pace
along the inside and gave way.

SKY FREAK showed good early speed while racing along the inside, dug in late and prevailed under strong encouragement. KINGSBURY DREAM was
allowed to settle early, moved up along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and gained ground gamely late. KURINGAI stalked the early pace,
moved up to challenge around the far turn, raced four deep at the eighth pole and weakened in the latter stages. HEART'S PASSION was shuffled back at
the break, raced four wide into the lane and had not enough. NO TIME TO PLAY was allowed to settle early and failed to have a response. COUNTESS ST
MICHEL pressed the pace from the outside and tired readily.

early, angled four wide through the upper stretch and finished well late. MR D'S WAY was bumped at the break, raced five wide at the eighth pole and had
not enough in the drive. TWO PAIR was allowed to settle in the early stages, moved up four wide nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the latter
