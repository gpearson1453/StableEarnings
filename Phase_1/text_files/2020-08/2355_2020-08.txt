bumped, then dueled with YEAHIKNOW, edged ahead of that one and held. YEAHIKNOW well placed and off the rail, moved up on the two path through
the second turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, drifting out slightly, was bumped by a drifting rival, dueled and was outfinished by that one. AWESOME
HALO tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. THE
TORTOISE sprinted to a long lead well off the rail, incrreased his margin to the lane, then faded in the drive. A CLAIM OF FOUL AND A STEWARDS'

SOLO TRY allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, navigated through traffic and drove clear late.
MOZA well placed and off the rail, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, gained a short lead at the furlng
marker, then was no match for the winner late and held the place safe. PINE JUNCTION never far back, saved ground through the turn, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick and missed the place. R CHERRY rated inside, moved up to gain a short lead into the turn,
stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. DAISES OF MAY ran evenly. SHORE SHOT set the early pace off the
rail, stayed on when challenged into the turn, then faded in the drive. JAMAICAN ME HAPPY allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the turn and
had no stretch rally. GOOD HEARTED CAT was never involved. SHES A MAMA'S GIRL was no factor.

Footnotes
MR. MIKE never far back, looped three and four wide through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear late. HOLY
TRUTH mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and closed well for the place. MAMMOTH tracked the pace,
angled out to loop four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and evened out late. WATCH THE DIP stalked the pace on the outside, took
command through the turn, then weakened late and held a share. I HAVEWHATIT TAKES well placed and off the rail, held position two and three wide
through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and weakened in the drive. LAUGHINAGAIN set the early pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into
the turn, then had no stretch rally. THE MAN CAN was no factor. GROWL was never involved.

Footnotes
LAWN DART sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased her margin without challenged, then held under steady pressure. SOUTHERN
RUFFLES well placed and inside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and closed well for the place. MORGAN'S Z
VA lunged at the start, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and edged up for the
show. BRIDGE DANCER well placed and off the rail, angled in and saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then
weakened the final furlong and held a share. ULTIMATE BARONESS passed tiring rivals. MY DOUGHNUT well placed and three wide, held position on the
two path through the turn, then had no stretch rally. MONSOON RAIN was no factor.
