Footnotes
BAYSIDER broke a step slowly from the gate, moved up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady gain and edged
up in the final strides. MAXIMUM FACTOR set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, shook clear in the late going and was
outfinished. MIKADO stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, then lacked the needed late kick. UNFLAPPABLE MAX mid pack
and outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and did not have enough in the late going. MR. HAMILTON rated
inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide into the lane and evened out. FIFTEEN TO VEGAS mid pack, saved ground on the two
path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and had a mild gain. SAVE ME PAULA improved his position. SUNNY SIDE OVER mid pack and inside,
saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened in the drive. SANDLOT SAM well placed and between rivals,
held position three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and had no rally. FIGHTIN PHIL was no factor. BUCKS WILDESCAPADE well placed
and three wide, faded after a half.
