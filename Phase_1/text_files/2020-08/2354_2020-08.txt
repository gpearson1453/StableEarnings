Footnotes
FRAN'S WORRIER stalked the dueling leaders outside, bid easily on the turn, rallied clear and lasted. EL DULZURA vied along the rail, shook off rival in
mid-stretch and continued gamely. GLACIER EXPRESS balked at loading, raced far behind, split foes late and surged in the late stages. HERE WEGO
broke alertly and angled inside, moved closer on the turn, angled out but yielded. LOAN ME YOUR EAR lacked speed outside, moved very wide into the
stretch and finished willingly. OFF THE MARK earned a narrow advantage outside then faded in the final furlong. WICKED GRIN lagged far behind and
never menaced. BLAZE A TRAIL chased outside and weakened steadily.

TOMMY'S TOP CAT dueled along the inside, edged clear on the turn and remained safe while kept to a drive. BARCODE steadied early, advanced inside
and finished willingly. MARCH SCREAMER stumbled at the start and raced far back, bid wide, and closed with late energy. TIZANOXBOW vied three wide
down the backstretch then proved empty in the stretch. PAHALL REVEAR lacked speed inside and was never in contention. MASS APPEAL well placed
outside the dueling leaders and gave way in the stretch. FAIRLY BOLD vied between rivals to the far turn then stopped.

Footnotes
FOR THE ROAD took the lead at once,set the pace in three path under rating, drew off own on his own and won in hand. TRULY A MOON SHOT split rivals
moving on the far turn, swung out and gained place. ADULATION, between rivals early, also swung out and took up chase but was no match. PEGASUS
RED was being steered inside, made it to the rail leaving the turn and was no real threat. OGEECHEE, outside early, went between foes on turn and
through stretch and tired. ASK CHUCK saved ground to near stretch, steadied briefly near quarter pole. IRONBOUND, between foes in second flight, tired.
DRAXHALL WOODS was very wide and failed to menace. MALIBU HIGH broke slowly and raced wide. TEMPESTUOUS ANGEL broke slowly, was hustled
up inside then stopped. As per ruling 20118pp from the Pa racing commission, Truly A Moon Shot was dq'ed due to a positive test.

Footnotes
JOYCEE'S SPIRIT trailed early, advanced three wide on the turn, angled wider in the stretch and surged clear in the final sixteenth. WHITNEY COVE
settled outside, rallied into the stretch, loomed a threat but was outfinished. BUCKS SOME set the pace in the two path then inside, led to mid-stretch and
weakened. CONGAREE ROSE reserved outside, bid on the turn, raced an erratic course through the stretch but came again. GODDESS OF CASH
prompted the leader outside to the stretch and gave way. LI'LBITO'CHARM was urged close up inside, steadied briefly on the turn and faded. TIZ A DATE
saved ground and weakened steadily. ICE CREAM PARTY dropped back early, moved extremely wide into the stretch while outrun. A claim of foul by the
rider of CONGAREE ROSE against the rider of WHITNEY COVE for interference in the stretch was dismissed

GREAT GO GO set a clear pace inside then held rival safe the entire stretch while maintained to a drive. ALFATEI pursued the winner outside, loomed a
threat in the stretch but could not get by the winner. OUR STORMIN NORMAN saved ground close up, faded on the turn but continued willingly. IRISH
MEADOW dropped far behind and closed a gap along the inside. MR. ROUNDTREE lacked speed then advanced outside without menacing. MT
SURIBACHI was urged close up between foes then faltered on the turn. STRICTLY THE BEST chased wide, made a brief bid on the turn then faded.
ATLANTIC CHILL raced outside within striking range then stopped abruptly.

BRILLIANT CHASE racing outside, caught the lead leaving the turn, repulsed that rival deep stretch and edged away. ROMANOFF saved ground, drifted
out slightly on the far turn, resisted gamely when challenged but was no match late. GHOST GAME, unhurried early, was very wide on the turn, moved in a
bit and was no real threat. INTER MIAMI three wide dueling for the early lead, tired. ROOKIE SALSA got to the rail on the turn and then swung veery wide
into stretch and failed to menace. POLAR BEAR PETE saved ground and tired.

APPEALING FUTURE broke slowly, advanced five wide circling his field on the turn, battled remainder of trip and was up in the final stride. HE IZ GONE
prompted the pace outside, led into the stretch and lost a tight decision following a long drive. BOB'S MY UNCLE steadied in tight in the chute, bid outside
and closed well too late. ASPHALT PAVING dueled inside, led after a quarter mile and continued gamely to the finish. MANOLETE settled close up between
rivals and flattened out in the final furlong. DROSSELMAGIC steadied along in the chute then faltered on the turn. TACTICAL PURSUIT (IRE) hustled close
up inside for half a mile and gave way. WORTH HIS SALT earned a narrow lead outside, vied for half a mile and stopped. ALL STAR RED was a late
scratch at the gate by the stewards on the advice of the track veterinarian.

FIX ME A SANDWICH, the claim back, took the lead at once, set the pace in the four path under under light rating, extended near mid stretch, was put to
strong right handed rousing soon after as he began to shorten stride, through deep stretch but had more than enough to be clear while drifting out. MOON
GATE WARRIOR, racing in the four path, was gaining late. THREE PHASE, very wide, passed tiring foes. TRUE BOLDNESS, lapped on his stablemate,
tired. DIRECT ORDER stumbled leaving the gate, split rivals on the turn, eased out into stretch and was no threat. THEY SHOT SONNY, between foes and
just off the pace, tired. GUNS OF STEEL failed to menace. GET THE W was very wide and tired badly. NAVY COMMANDER chased outside winner than
stopped.

Footnotes
BOJINGLE moved boldly outside on the turn, moved clear briefly in mid-stretch and held on gamely following a long drive. ARK IN THE DARK rallied with
the winner on the turn, battled inside in the stretch but continued willingly. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY saved ground off the leaders, swung wide at the quarter
pole then surged through the stretch but was too late. HITMEWTHURBESTSHOT was urged close up down the backstretch then gradually weakened.
CANIFORM trailed early inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well. SCREEN SAVER was unruly prior to the start, dropped back outside and was no
factor. LUCKY HERO lacked speed and gave way readily. ASHRAQ hustled to a clear lead early, vied through the turn then proved empty in the lane.
SMART ROYAL T chased outside and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
LIGHT OF HOPE came in and bumped SUNSHINE SKY after an extremely long gate load and a gate scratch, raced in the four path,split rivals to take the
lead, was clear with a furlong to run and won under strong handling. AMERICAN MONEY, unruly prestart, raced three wide early, split rivals in the stretch
but was too late. SUNSHINE SKY bobbled then was bumped leaving the gate, raced wide and challenged but then flattened out. LA BELLA CHICA broke
slowly, split rivals on the turn, moved to the rail, steadied in tight mid stretch. WHEREWITHAL failed to menace passing faders. WONDER CHARM came
out sharply at the start bumping CATALINA R, angled in and set the pace for a half and then had little left. PLAY BY PLAY saved ground just off the early
pace then tired. CHOCOLATTE broke slowly, bore out badly and was far back. YELITZA had only brief speed. CATALINA R, bumped soundly leaving the
gate, raced wide. DUBLIN MEGAN was very wide, gave way and returned bleeding from her left nostril. GRACEFUL MONARCH WAS ORDERED
SCRATCHED ON THE ADVICE OF THE VETERINARIAN. A CONSOLATION DAILY DOUBLE WAS PAID, ALL OTHER WAGERS ON HER WERE
REFUNDED.
