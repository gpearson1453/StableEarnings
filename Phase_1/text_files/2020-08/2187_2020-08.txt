Footnotes
NORTHERN FERN exchanged a bump and was steadied slightly at the start, lacked early speed despite some encouragement, moved in to race on or just
off the rail trailing the field through the turn, rallied along the inside to get up late. STORM SHAKER switched off the inside early racing last but one, went in
the three path through the turn, rallied late but just missed. BABY ROSE dueled outside a rival, entered the turn two deep, edged clear midway on that
bend, widened into upper stretch then faltered and faded. SASHAYING SIS tracked from inside the leading pair early, eased back and switched out past the
half-mile marker, lost ground three to four wide on the turn and failed to rally. IMGOINOUTTONIGHT vied between runners briefly then dueled inside,
switched outside BABY ROSE three wide past the quarter pole and came up empty in the lane. MISS DOMESIUS raced widest going four to six deep on
the turn and was never a threat. HEAD FAKE exchanged a light bump at the start, moved out to race four to five deep through the turn chasing mid-pack,
dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
COOL AND QUICK vied inside rivals but just off the rail heading up the backstretch, allowed a little more rein early on the turn going in the two path on that
bend and began to edge away, drifted to nearly the four path turning for home but having extended the advantage, was shaken up at the top of the stretch,
given one right-handed tap of the whip in mid-stretch while drifting in a bit at that juncture, the rider went to hand urging before looking back for challengers
nearing the wire and wrapped up late to celebrate his first victory in the irons. DIXIE JEN settled mid-pack off the leaders, went five wide on the turn, gained
the place. EMILY WHO vied between foes early then chased from outside the winner going three to four wide on the turn, needed more. GOING TO
JACKSON shifted in up the backstretch, advanced along the rail moving out four wide coming past the three-sixteenths and within striking distance but
could not sustain the effort. OUR NATIVE ANGEL had brief speed to be among and between the early leaders, dropped back and shifted in late up the
backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to rally. REGOLA D'ORO settled off the leaders and shifted in up the backstretch, trailed in the two
to three path on the turn, was not a threat. CANCAN showed brief speed prompting the pace from outside, dropped back four wide on the turn, tired.

Footnotes
STORM ON settled last but one racing outside in about the four path through the first turn, began to advance five wide on the far turn, struck the lead just
past the sixteenth pole and edged clear. RIVER HEAD was mid-pack outside early going four to five wide, edged closer up the backstretch, entered the far
turn five wide moving in a bit on that bend, took a narrow lead by the head of the lane but was overtaken in late stretch while holding the place. CHACHAS
SPECIAL settled at the rear just off the fence, went in the two path mostly through both turns, angled inside rivals in mid-stretch and made a bid but was too
late. HUSH'S STORM stalked early three to four wide, moved forward to prompt the issue up the backstretch, moved in a path on the far turn while inside
foes dropped back but was overtaken late on that bend, weakened some in the stretch. REBACK HOME forced the issue inside a rival but off the rail
through the first turn, began to lose ground leaving the backstretch and was guided out three deep about the five-sixteenths, ran on evenly in the stretch. A
ZENON NITE came off the fence to race in the two to three path on the first turn in the back half, was in a bit tight behind rivals entering the far turn,
continued four wide on that bend and failed to rally. WRAPPED tracked the leaders in the two path into the first turn, moved to the rail early on that bend
and moved up to press the issue inside briefly, slowly dropped back late up the backstretch running along the rail, came out in the stretch and passed a tired
rival late. BILLY JOE WHO prompted the pace three to four wide in the early going, dropped in to the rail on the far turn and came up empty.
