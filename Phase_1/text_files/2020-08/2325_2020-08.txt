Footnotes
DIVINE BLESSING showed the best early speed to get to the inside raced off the rail entering the stretch allowing Sarah's Star to come through but held off
that challenge for the victory. SARAH'S STAR had a ground saving trip along the rail had room on the inside came through entering the stretch but could
never go by the winner while clearly second best. AINTTHATRIGHTUHHUH was well off the pace early came through on the inside turning for home and
was third best while no threat to the top pair. MY GOLDEN SCARLETT showed good early speed but was forced three wide was closest to the leader on the
turn but gave way in the stretch. TOP OF THE PODIUM raced in the two path for much of the race and never mounted a rally. SWEET AS CARO broke well
and then dropped back quickly and was never a serious factor after that. JUSTY was up close in the two path but was the first to tire on the turn. TYLERS
ANGEL WINGS trailed the entire race and was never a factor.

GOOCH EXPRESS showed good early speed and was able to save the rail was challenged on the turn and then edged clear through the stretch along the
inside for the win. LOOSE CHANGE made a bold move in the two path on the turn to get on even terms with the winner but could never go by while holding
second. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM was forced four wide on the turn got close to the top pair while wide but could not match strides with those two through
the stretch. LUCKY KID was able to get to the rail up the backstretch loomed boldly on the turn just behind the leaders but could not make up ground
through the stretch. PAPA JOE raced along the inside on the turn was making up some ground but could not get into serious contention. ROLL OUT raced
in the two path but could not make up the needed ground. GO' N JOY Z raced well off the rail while well back and did not make up ground. TRE was up
close while three wide early and then steadily faded after the first quarter. MAC'S DRAGON showed brief speed in the two path but gave way up the
backstretch.

Footnotes
KINKY KIM showed good early speed to get to the lead and the rail drew clear on her own and won handily. OUT OF THE SKY came five wide entering the
stretch to get into contention and was second best while not a threat to the winner. TRINNI raced along the inside to be in contention and held third. BONA
FIDE IMAGE raced along the inside and was making up some ground and was gaining on third. HONEY HEARTS was up close in the two path to the top of
the stretch and then dropped back. SHARP HOLIDAY showed some brief speed out of the gate and then faded. KELSEY raced four wide on the turn and
then was fanned six wide entering the stretch and could not make up ground. HIT THE DECK stumbled at the start and was always towards the back. MY
FUNNY GAL trailed throughout and was never a factor.

the stretch and edged clear in the final eighth. WANDERNINTHEFOREST showed the best early speed and was able to get to the rail was challenged on
the turn and hung tough to the eighth pole but could not go with the winner late. CHAPIS was three wide entering the stretch while battling for command but
could not go with the top two in the stretch. LIL MISS DE BUY raced off the rail just behind the early speed but never mounted a rally. EPSOM IMP raced in
the two path for much of the race but never mounted a serious bid. MY EXPRESSION was well of the pace in the two path and never mounted a serious
rally. OVER EXPOSED raced mid pack along the inside but faded on the turn. FAST PUFF trailed throughout and was not a factor.
