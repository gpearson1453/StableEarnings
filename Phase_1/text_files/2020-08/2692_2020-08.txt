moved up three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, shifted lanes at the eighth pole and finished evenly. LASKA raced off the pace inside and
passed tired rivals late. OVER TO YOU stumbled at the start, raced two wide off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and lacked a rally. STONEY'S

far turn, gained a short lead, dueled with the winner and dug in gamely inside to the end. VALEDICTORIAN set the pace, dueled on the far turn, chased the
leaders in upper stretch and weakened. SUPER TIGRESS was outrun early and did not factor. REPATRIATED GEM (GB) raced off the pace, two wide on

TERRY'S CHARM pulled on the first turn, then raced close up along the inside, made a rail bid entering the backside, dueled, dropped back, chased on the
final turn, re bid at the quarter pole, rallied steadily outside of SO HIGH (GB) in the final furlong and wore down that rival in the deep stretch to prevail. SO
HIGH (GB) stalked close up outside racing with a three wide trip throughout, bid three wide, dueled with CANDY CANE LANE, took over on the far turn, dug
in gamely in the final furlong and yielded grudgingly. CANDY CANE LANE vied inside for the early lead, then vied two wide on the backside, dueled into the
final turn and tired. DECISIVE TRIUMPH was outrun early and never factored. MOKHEEF vied two wide for the early lead, then chased and gave way. The
ten furlong fraction was unavailable.
