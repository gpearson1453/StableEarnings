Footnotes
DEHYDRATION broke in and bumped SOUTH BOOT SHIRLEY leaving the gate, dueled with that rival for command, inched away on the turn, responded
when challenged once again a furlong out and turned away the runner-up, moving clear late under a drive. SOUTH BOOT SHIRLEY knocked into rival at
the start, recovered to duel with DEHYDRATION, lost a bit of ground around the turn and into the stretch, re-bid at the eighth pole but could not match the
winner in the final sixteenth. DORITA'S LEMON broke out and bumped leaving the gate, chased inside, angled out into the two path entering the turn, kept
in that same path to the lane then finished willingly along the inside to earn the show. YOUR ROYAL COIL stalked outside a rival, three wide around the
turn, chased through the drive under right-handed urging then switched to the left-hand and lost the show. BELLA RENELLA broke out and got sandwiched
between foes at the start, settled in the early going, raced two then three wide around the turn, came out in the stretch and gained ground late.
ENCOUNTRESS broke out, trailed the field from the inside, steered out three wide leaving the bend and proved no menace. SYBIL'S KITTY bumped both
sides at the start, went four wide through the turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
A MELIS had good early speed from the outside, cleared the field and crossed over to the inside, controlled the pace up the backstretch, padded the lead
around the far turn, kept to task in the drive and won easily. HOT ON THE TRAIL off a bit slow to begin, went three to four wide on the first turn, chased off
the rail throughout, finished well while unable to threaten the winner but was clearly second best. TIME FOR EBBY threw head and off slow to begin,
settled, inside, asked at the three-eights and put to a drive shortly after, came out at the top of the lane, drifted out in the stretch and gained the show.
FLYING BUSINESS went three wide into the first turn, chased outside a rival, took aim at the leader up the backstretch, lost ground around the far turn,
angled in on that bend and faded in the lane. PEACE PIPE fractious in the gate, stumbled leaving, chased a bit off the rail, lost ground into the far turn,
eased around the bend and eventually crossed the wire and walked off following the race.

Footnotes
CAERULEAN set the pace under pressure to the outside, cleared entering the stretch under right-handed urging, led through the lane under a drive and
remained clear. MASTER RYAN stalked inside, saved ground around the turn, angled out in the stretch and finished well. CROOKED FINGER RAY stalked
off the rail, two wide around the turn, produced a mild rally and bested the rest. N. K. ROCKET MAN chased a bit off the rail, steadied at the three-eighths
pole, moved inside and came in tight quarters from the quarter pole to the stretch, gained a clear path and kept on for a minor award. JUNGLE ROAR
traveled along the inside, steadied off heels at the three-eighths, saved ground inside, angled out at the top of the lane and showed a mild response. SPUD
pressed the pace outside into and around the turn, chased two wide entering the stretch, came out some in the lane and weakened. SQUALOTORO off
slow to begin, chased outside a rival, angled out at the three-sixteenths and proved no menace. FLY BUDDY FLY off slow at the start, traveled a bit off the
rail, came out into the stretch and lacked a rally. EL CHAPIN attended the pace from the outside, went three deep into the turn, outpaced around the bend
and came three to four wide into the stretch and faded. RAWHIDE RAWLINS chased three deep early then outside a rival on the turn, came four wide into
the lane and had little left for the drive. HUMBOLDT off slow leaving the gate, dropped back and was always outrun. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
WILSHIRE DUDE between foes early then stalked off the rail, went three wide into the far turn, came out of the bend in the four path, range up three deep
upper stretch, took over at the eighth pole inched away under urging. EL HUERFANO forwardly placed outside the pacesetter, closed in and headed the
leader at the three-eighths, dueled around the turn and into the stretch, took a short lead in upper stretch, outkicked by the winner and held the place.
KYLEMORE raced a bit off the rail, asked right-handed at the quarter pole, angled in at the three-sixteenths, finished well along the inside and missed the
place. TREASURE HUNTER set the pace inside, responded when challenged at the three-eighths and dueled with EL HUERFANO into the drive, could not
keep pace in the final furlong, came out near the sixteenth marker and weakened. INCREDIBLE LUCK floated out on the first turn, chased off the rail to the
stretch and never made an impact. IMAGINEIAMFASTEST pulled early then drifted out on the first turn, settled off the pace, two to three wide around the far
turn and never threatened. SEVEN OXEN raced outside a rival, dropped back and angled in on the far turn and tired in the late stages.

MOONHALL MILLY (IRE) three wide into the first turn, tracked outside a rival, three deep at the seven-sixteenths, roused three wide into the lane, bid four
deep and between rivals in the stretch and got up. MIND OUT allowed to settle off the rail, swung four wide into the stretch, moved out further and rallied six
wide and just missed. GOING TO VEGAS pulled early near the inside, chased along the fence then tipped out into the stretch, bid three deep inside the
eighth pole, led briefly late and caught in the closing moments. BEGUILED unhurried through the early stages, saved ground into the lane, steered out and
came with a late rally. MYLITTLERUNAWAY dueled for command early and angled to the inside, inched away then dueled with MERNEITH into and around
the far turn and into the stretch, fought back inside through the final furlong but got outfinished. MERNEITH dueled from the outside then chased on the
backstretch, moved up once again to challenge for command and took a short lead at the three-eighths, dueled through the final bend and into the stretch,
battled down the stretch and yielded grudgingly. SUMMER LOVE stalked a bit off the rail, between rivals at the seven-sixteenths, two wide around the bend
and weakened. ROADRUNNER'S HONOR off slow to begin, trailed throughout and was never a factor. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
WESTON off alertly, pulled early then moved outside of GIRTHER, went up to vie between rivals, dueled from the outside into the stretch, lost a bit of
ground in the lane then came back and dug in late to get up. GIRTHER sped to the front and angled in, vied with a pair of rivals then dueled into the drive,
looked to be getting the best of the duel with WESTON in the stretch but could not hold off the winner nearing the wire and was vanned off following the
race. AMBIVALENT bumped leaving the gate, stalked a bit off the rail, angled out into the four path, shifted in and bumped SONIC BREES in upper stretch
and gained ground on the top pair in the late stages. SONIC BREES broke out and bumped leaving the gate, went up inside to be forwardly placed, came
two wide into the stretch, bumped hard by AMBIVALENT in upper stretch and kept on for a minor award. SCHNELL raced off the rail, angled in on the turn
and lacked a bid. HERD IMMUNITY off a bit slow to begin, tracked off the inside, exited the turn four wide and never responded to urging. RODERICK
chased the speed early then angled out and went up to vie three deep for the lead, could not match with the top pair leaving the turn and gave way. THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED AMBIVALENT FROM THIRD TO FOURTH FOR SHIFTING IN AND BUMPING SONIC BREES IN THE STRETCH, COSTING
HIM A CHANCE A BETTER PLACING.

headed rival at the three-sixteenths, took control in the lane and drove clear. BIG FLAME rushed up from the inside and gained command then moved clear,
pressured into the drive, fought back inside, could not match the winner in the final furlong but proved second best. ALEXANDER'S DREAM up close early
between runners, chased inside around the turn and into the stretch and got up for the show. SUZIE QZZ BROTHER chased the early speed, angled in and
took the turn two wide, came out a bit in the stretch and lacked a bid. CHARGE CASH bumped leaving the gate, stalked from the outside, went three wide
into the lane and was edged for the show. CRASH CORRIGAN off slow to begin, went four wide through the turn and was never a factor.

BODHICITTA (GB) stalked inside, angled out upper stretch, rallied outside the leader and nailed foe at the wire. TONAHUTU (IRE) stalked outside the
pacesetter, asked around the far turn, bid alongside into the stretch, took over past the eighth pole but got caught at the wire. HARMLESS away quickly, set
the pace along the inside, responded when challenged into the drive, resisted through the lane but yielded in the final sixteenth. LADY PRANCEALOT (IRE)
allowed to settle in the early going, traveled outside a rival, between runners on the backstretch, lacked room into the stretch and angled to the inside and
finished with a mild rally. BEAU RECALL (IRE) unhurried in the early going, settled off the inside, went three deep past the nine-sixteenths marker, angled
four wide into the stretch and summoned a mild late bid. SUMMERING off a bit slow to begin, chased from the inside, rank from the eleven-sixteenths to the
nine-sixteenths marker, saved ground into the lane and could not find more in the final furlong. KEEPER OFTHE STARS in range from off the rail, came
three wide into the stretch and weakened. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
DR. SCHIVEL stalked off the inside, angled four wide leaving the turn, rallied outside the top pair, took over near the furlong marker and drew off to the wire.
SPIELBERG chased the pace from the outside, bid three wide leaving the turn, led briefly in upper stretch but proved no match for the winner. NOBLE
REFLECTION sped to the front and angled to the inside, fought back when challenged into the drive and weakened in the late stages. WASPIRANT settled
outside a rival while well off the rail, entered the turn five wide then moved in a path and came four wide into the stretch and never rallied. FEEL THE
BERNING lacked early speed, raced three wide into the lane, split foes in upper stretch and also lacked a rally. SUPERMAN SHAQ up close early to the
outside of the pacesetter, chased in the two path and weakened in the drive. HONORARY DEGREE off slow to begin, raced four wide into the turn, angled
into the two path around the bend, came in upper stretch and tired. FLACTEM LEGACY broke in, raced off the pace and was never a factor.
