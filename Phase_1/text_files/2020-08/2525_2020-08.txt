Footnotes
LABYRINTH well placed near the inside, shifted out past the quarter pole, was herded out to the eight path at the top of the stretch, dug in to make the lead
near the furlong marker and just lasted under a strong hand ride. TAURUS C trailed early, closed fast in the three path through the stretch and just missed
getting up in time. JOE CAIN pressed the pace three then two wide through the turn, was forced out to the seven path entering the stretch then was
outfinished despite a game try. STORM PEAK battled for the early lead along the inside, was squeezed past the half mile marker causing his rider to check,
came on gain through upper stretch then leveled off late. SKIBBEREEN battled for the lead between horses from the gate, drifted in past the half mile pole,
set the pace under pressured into the stretch, drifted out to the six path then weakened late. CONDUCIVE failed to menace. LEOPOLDO close up, swung
wide then lacked the needed response. LEAP BABY LEAP was through early.

OPEN OUT never far back, surged through deep stretch in the five path under a perfectly timed ride and was along in time. SMOOTH TALKIN TOM pressed
the pace two wide into the stretch, made the lead, shook clear before the furlong marker and couldn't handle the winner. TACTICAL QUALITY unhurried
early, swung wide and closed a gap through the stretch in the middle of the racetrack. FATHER DENNIS trailed early, remained well back for six furlongs
then found his best stride late inside. DOC KANE was hustled to a narrow advantage soon after the start, set a pressured pace to the top of the stretch then
weakened slightly. DARINGLY BOLD failed to menace. BRUHLMEYER was through after a half.

four path on the far turn then leveled off. DREAM ON JILLY close up inside, went evenly. COLORINCOLONEL was bumped at the start then failed to
menace through finished on even terms with DREAM ON JILLY at the wire. CHARM OF THE CITY loomed boldly three wide before a half, stopped on the

SCARED WARIOR never far back, rallied late under relentless right handed urging in the seven path through the stretch and got up in the final strides.
UYEDA pressed the pace three wide, made the lead, shook clear in upper stretch, drifted to the six path and was caught in the final stages. IMA BELIEVER
trailed, swung wide and closed a gap late past the middle of the racetrack. GUCCISSIMO had speed from the start, moved closer on the turn then came up
empty. MINE'S DIALED IN pressed the pace along the inside into the stretch then gave way. SHARKS COVE was bumped at the start and the half mile
pole and was no threat. WATCH YOUR STEP dueled for the early lead between rivals, had his heels clipped past the half mile marker, was in tight between
rivals nearing the quarter pole then dropped out of it. ATTUCK bobbled outward bumping SHARKS COVE at the start, rushed up behind rivals, lacked
racing room, bumped SHARKS COVE again near the half mile marker then clipped heels with WATCH YOUR STEP, stumbled and unseated his rider. THE
STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

SMALL TOWN HERO broke inward bumping HALFBACK a the start, set all the pace while getting quick fractions, shook clear under right handed urging in
upper stretch and prevailed under a strong hand ride. ZULU LEGEND chased the winner all the way and was steadily gaining ground late in a game effort.
CUMBER went evenly. DISTORTEDATTHEBAR failed to menace. OPRAH'S RANGER was outrun. HALFBACK was bumped then bobbled at the start,
stalked the pace for a half then gave way.
