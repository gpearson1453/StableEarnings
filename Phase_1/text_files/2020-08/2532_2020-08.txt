SNEAKY SISTER contested the pace along the rail, took pressure through the far turn inside of CRAFTY ENGAGEMENT and LITTLE ROSALYN, dueled
through the stretch inside of CRAFTY ENGAGEMENT and narrowly prevailed under a long drive. CRAFTY ENGAGEMENT prompted the early pace
between rivals, battled into the stretch outside of SNEAKY SISTER and was out nodded. LITTLE ROSALYN broke alertly then vied outside for the early lead
into the backstretch, pressed the pace from the four path, was unable to to move on with rivals into the stretch and finished gamely outside for show. SALSA
TANGO trailed the field from off the rail, uncoiled a bid inside into the stretch and was edged out for a placing. SPIN A TALE tracked the pacesetters along
the rail, shifted out into the lane and failed to threaten in the drive. TACTICAL EDGE sat in range while five wide and lacked a serious bid.

STORMCHASER prompted the pace from the three path under a snug hold, overtook STRIDERS RING approaching the quarter pole, responded gamely to
looming threat by ZIPPITY ZAP mid stretch and drove clear. ZIPPITY ZAP away well then sat just off the pace from the two path, came under
encouragement at the quarter pole, moved up menacingly inside but was unable to stall the winner. SMARTY RIVER PANTS never far back, went three
wide into the far turn, chased outside into the lane but was unable to improve position through the drive. ZICATELA raced at the back of the pack and bid
belatedly into the stretch. REGAL MAX stalked inside then trailed entering the lane and passed tiring. STRIDERS RING contested the early pace from just
off the rail, was overtaken by STORMCHASER at the quarter pole and faltered.

BIONIC BIRD quickly moved to a clear lead from off the rail, held good margins entering the far turn, seen his advantage shorten entering the lane and held
sway. REFLECTIONOFVALUES trailed wide then angled towards the rail entering the far turn, advanced gradually inside then came under a drive into the
stretch and finished fast inside. LITTLE BRIAN settled off the pacesetters from between rivals, chased four to five wide into the lane, was gaining gradually
outside and settled for show. SHIMS SHADOW raced in closest pursuit of the leader from the four path through the backstretch, set aim on the BIONIC
BIRD into the final turn and lacked the closing response needed. SILENT EMISSARY settled mid pack outside between foes, chased outside into the lane
and passed tiring. STAR CZAR raced wide through the backstretch and came up empty into the lane. HORST tracked between foes and tired early.

HALLIE'S HERO pressured the pace from the three path, prompted action at the quarter pole, dueled outside of EDDYSHAK into the stretch, dug in late
under right handed urging brushing EDDY SHAK and inched up. EDDYSHAK set a pressured pace from just off the rail, responded to challenge from
HALLIE'S HERO into the lane, brushed HALLIE'S HERO then rallied determinedly inside late stretch and was out finished. MIDNIGHT SHAKE saved
ground along the rail, chased from the quarter pole then was along in time for show. MR. KALYPSO tracked outside while four wide, fanned three wide
through the far turn and lacked the rally needed through the drive. PARKING PERMIT trailed throughout. **JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by
the rider of EDDYSHAK against the rider of HALLIE'S HERO alleging interference late stretch was not allowed after review of the Stewards. No change was
made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
TAP MASTER hustled to the front, showed the way through the far turn, saw his advantage diminish mid stretch and just held on. PACIORETTY never far
back outside, was asked to quicken leaving the final turn then circled into the lane, closed quickly outside and just missed. MOON KING lacked a clear path
leaving then hustled inside, chased the leader into the lane but was no match and held off rival for show honors. MR. DAZZLE allowed to settle mid pack
while three to four wide, gained contention entering the stretch and was edged out late. THISDEWARSFORYOU vied outside for the early lead then was out
sprinted to the turn and had little in reserve for the drive. CANDY GIANT sat in range outside, was roused into the lane and came up empty in the drive.
STAPLETON broke outward then saved ground inside and yielded into the stretch.

Footnotes
GO WILD saved ground early inside, was asked to quicken at the five sixteenth pole then rallied into the stretch and won driving. WATER WAGON settled in
the three path, took closer order leaving the backstretch, circled into the lane then came under steady urging outside and was out kicked. BOLSANO settled
outside from the three path in striking distance, moved up closer in the far turn, rallied four wide at the quarter pole then was along in time for a placing.
CASH REWARD went four wide leaving the opening turn, sat mid pack between foes, was asked to quicken approaching the quarter pole then came under
a drive, moved up alongside the leader and weakened late. THIN LINE fanned three wide leaving the opening turn, pressed MR. IRRELEVANT through the
backstretch, inherited the lead at the half marker, responded to challenge from CASH REWARD and gave way grudgingly inside. INDICATIVE hustled
inside early, chased the pacesetters through the backstretch, waited for running room along the rail, lodged a bid into the lane but failed to menace. MR.
IRRELEVANT secured the lead into the backstretch, was overtaken after the half marker and retired early.

REDNECK REMARK sat in striking range while four wide, ranged up four wide into the lane, responded to urging outside and prevailed under a late drive.
BURNIN' POCKETS hustled away, lost ground leaving the far turn, chased hard into the lane, shifted inward to the rail closing quickly and just missed.
MYSTERIOUS PROMISE pressed outside then moved up alongside of PEYTONS PRINCE in the far turn, was headed into the stretch then drifted mid
stretch under pressure and was caught in the final strides. POKER TABLE chased from the two path, shifted out then closed gap into the lane then gained
quickly outside under light handling. THE LADY CHABLIS bucked after leaving the gate then was hustled into closer contention, moved up menacingly
outside and finished evenly outside. PEYTONS PRINCE sent for speed inside, was unable to moved on with rival approaching the quarter pole and faded
inside through the stretch. FROBISHER BAY hustled away and offered a late mild bid. WEST OF SABINAL last away then chased outside and gave way.

Footnotes
ZUCCHINI stalked the pacesetters while three wide leaving the backstretch, set aim on IMPOSING CAT into the lane, moved up alongside rival mid stretch
and drove clear. IMPOSING CAT vied inside for the early lead, gained the lead while saving ground into the lane, responded to challenge from ZUCCHINI at
the head of the stretch and was worn down late. THISISMYSTORY tracked inside, swung out into the lane, closed outside under mild handling and missed.
CHISUM G sat mid pack then chased into lane and was unable to improve contention through the stretch. LONG TIME DON lost ground leaving the
backstretch, bore out at the top of the lane and offered a late run while wide through the stretch. PHIL POWER trailed early and failed to reached contention.
PHANTOM ZIP outrun throughout. WYATT hustled to the front early then contended the pace through the backstretch and left nothing in reserve for the
drive. **JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of IMPOSING CAT against the rider of ZUCCHINI alleging interference in the stretch drive
was disallowed after review of the Stewards. No change to the order of finish.
