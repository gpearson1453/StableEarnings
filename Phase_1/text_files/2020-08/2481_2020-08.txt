MANHATTAN LADY In hand along the two path, three path on the last turn, angled wide, rallied to take the lead and drew off. KABUKI Never far back, four
wide on the turns, angled out into the lane, chased and then was no match. I'M A GOOD LOOKER Set the pace off the rail around the turns, was hooked
and weakened. KATERI EMPIRE Tracked the leader along the rail, eased out some into the lane, altered in with a furlong left and weakened. KIM Unhurried
four wide on the turns and weakened. MAMMA WHITE SOCKS Fractious in the gate just as they opened, broke sluggishly, tracked along the three path and
tired. ANDROMEDA'S CHILD Trailed without mishap.
