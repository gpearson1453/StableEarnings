hand ride. WITCH chased in the two path and gained only mildly to be second best. NEARLY MISSED advanced outside on the backstretch, raced the
three path around the final turn then tired in the lane. SECRET ACCOUNT ducked out sharply leaving the gate, bumped STEPH'S PRINCESS then trailed.
STEPH'S PRINCESS was bumped into the winner a few strides out of the gate, advanced in hand between rivals on the backstretch then stopped suddenly
nearing the far turn.

Footnotes
KONSTANTINOVA settled, began a strong run on the outside after a half, moved two wide to command midway on the final turn, ran out entering the
stretch and widened under mild urging. SMARTY SOCKS was slow early, moved through tight quarters along the rail around the final turn and outfinished
tired ones for the place. WEE ARCH settled inside, raced three wide between rivals around the final turn and continued evenly through the lane.
PRINGIPESSA delayed the start when reluctant to load, chased the early leader from along the rail and weakened. ECLIPTICALS DANCER wasn't far back
outside early while racing two wide, came out four wide on the final turn and continued evenly. AFRICAN SONG had good position two wide into the far turn
then stopped. BUTTON CANDY sped to a clear lead soon after the break, stayed just out from the rail while making the pace for over three-quarters then
stopped. BRAZILIAN BAY was outrun after a slow break. POLLYPEPTIDE trailed. Off time was delayed 13 minutes because of the slow load and MARY
ELIZABETH flipping in the gate.

final yards. L. A. HOUSE opened a clear lead after going a furlong, stayed close to the inside while making the pace for about a mile then gave way. NEW

EIFS settled, stayed inside around the turn and into the stretch, rallied to the front after a half then drew clear late. JERSEY LIFE chased inside, began to
angle out while moving on the turn, was carried very wide into the stretch, angled in sharply in midstretch to vie outside the winner but couldn't keep up late.
MERROW was hustled to a clear lead soon after the break, bore out on the backstretch, bore out badly entering the stretch, continued to bear out under left
hand whip, steadied in midstretch and faded. An objection by Rojas against the second finisher was not allowed.

Footnotes
SACRED SHO GRL opened a clear lead soon after the break, was rated out from the rail, responded when challenged into the final furlong and held
stubbornly. CLARA CREEK chased in the three path, gave her best outside the winner into the final furlong but wasn't enough. LIKEUONLYPRETTIER
raced the two path around the turn and gained to the end. LET'S GO DANZING hesitated in the gate, left several lengths behind the field, stayed along the
rail and was best of the rest. STORMY SPELL stayed close up along the inside into the turn then stopped in the lane. AUNT MARIE was outrun. DARK
HEART raced well out from the inside around the turn while outrun. CHIMERA wasn't far back to the turn, stopped and was eased up through the lane.

MR. SKITTLES was content to lag following a slow break, was put to strong whip in the five path on the turn and quickly ran clear from the outside through
the final yards. GET A VALENTINE rallied three wide to command just before a half, drew out entering the stretch, drifted through late stretch and gave way.
IREDELL raced the three path and outfinished tired ones in an even effort. EXPEDITER was hard ridden from the gate to duel, stayed inside and had
nothing left for the drive. INDIGESTION was no factor. CARDCOUNTER was pinched between horses while wide into the stretch then flattened out.
HAYNESFIELD BEST was hustled to duel outside early, raced two wide into the turn and was finished after a half.
