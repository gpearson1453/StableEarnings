WEEKEND BUZZ prompted the pace two wide, until mid stretch, dug in determinedly to make the lead and shook clear late under left handed urging.
SWEET LEMON DROP broke in front, dropped inside, set the pace until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. TIDE RISING allowed to settle,
improved position on the turn then leveled off. JUDGE HEAD was shut off at the start and finished with good energy in the seven path. JIMTOWN up close
four wide, was through early. MA MOOS WARRIOR bore out at the start, had speed into the turn then gave way. ROMEO POWER bore in badly at the
start, had brief speed, stopped and jogged to the wire.

VAN DAMME unhurried early, closed willingly in the seven path through the stretch and was along in time. THIRTYSILVERPIECES broke in front, set a
pressured pace into the stretch, the ride lost his whip at the furlong marker and gamely held on for second. KING VALERO vied for the lead three wide,
loomed boldly midway on the far turn two wide, battled until deep stretch and was outfinished. SHAKEDOWN failed to menace. FLIGHT MISSION chased
the pace for a half two wide then weakened. CHASING THE STARS pressed the pace along the inside early and was through after a half. KNOCKOUT
RANGER trailed.

AWESOME MACHINE angled out and sprinted to a clear lead three wide before a quarter, set the balance of the pace unchallenged and won as much the
best under a strong hand ride. HOPES AND PRAYERS chased the winner and finished well clear for second. LA CAFETERA void of early speed, passed
tiring rivals through the stretch. DINNER FOR TWO had good early speed then faded. WARRIOR BABY was no factor. FORMER BUNNY chased the
winner through the turn then stopped in the stretch.
