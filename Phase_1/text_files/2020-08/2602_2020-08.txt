rail late needing a touch more. FLAT OUT SMOKIN tracked the pace racing evenly to upper stretch outbidding the others from the two path. JOYEUX in
tight was squeezed back at the break, recovered to race in mid pack through the far turn angling four wide in upper stretch improving a bit. IM A PATRIOT
slow early saved ground to upper stretch finishing evenly along the inside. GRAN GREYFROST raced a step slow in second flight failing to mount a bid
from mid track down the lane. ALPHASTEST veered out rushing from the gate, set the pace to the far turn then wore out the final eighth. BOMBONERO

ELWOOD'S ADVICE stalked the pace saving ground to upper stretch edging clear gamely along the rail. CREAKY CRICKET hustled to the early lead set
the pace through the far turn, engaged from the inside in upper stretch angled from the two to the three path proving no match while hanging on for place.
MY OWN LANE slow early circled out to upper stretch finishing well near mid track. GREAT PLAN raced mid pack coming three wide in upper stretch
angling in a bit while finishing evenly. RIPINANDATEARIN hustled off the pace raced all out six wide down the lane hanging late. STARLING'S LAW stalked
the pace pressing hard on the far turn extending in bid upper stretch weakening late. BOURBON N LIME played no factor. MISTERBULLTOYOU raced
wide giving way on the far turn. Six furlong fraction is HAND TIMED.

DO YOU LIKE THAT never far back lost ground throughout racing seven path down the lane gaining momentum as the front end tired surging up at the
wire. PENNYS FROM HEAVEN tracked the pace racing six wide down the stretch surging between horses in the closing yards. DANCE HALL DOLL
slipped leaving the gate spotting the field lagging through the turn, saved ground to upper stretch rallying gamely from the rail. SENSING MISCHIEF stalked
the pace looming in range down the lane lacking punch at mid track. MRS POOCHIE sent clear set the pace holding daylight to upper stretch digging in
from the three path faltering late. COME ON CALLIE raced evenly bidding on the inside in upper stretch weakening late.
