Footnotes
BRIDGING THE GAP stalked the early pace then took the lead into the backstretch, drew clear from the seven sixteenths pole, was pressured into the far
turn and drew off under steady handling, then allowed to relax a bit later yards. AMELIA BEDELIA rated off the pace two deep, started a bid toward the
three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, but had to settled for second best. CAMERON STREET raced off the pace and well off the rail,
bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and was just up for third under the wire. LADY STORM saved ground off the pace
then picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, though, flattened stride the final furlong. LIKE ME OR NOT rated a slim early lead inside but gave
up the advantage into the backstretch, chased through the backstretch then gave way past the five sixteenths pole. GANDARI rated close to the early pace
and picked up the chase from the half mile pole, then faded through the far turn.

Footnotes
RUM RUNNER RED settled back in the three and four paths the first turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, steadily progressed in the five path of the
far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and was steadily handled to hold off MAN OF THE NIGHT, who saved ground off the pace then bid nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, dueled to a slim brief lead in the upper stretch but was outfinished the final sixteenth. ELEANOR'S DIAMOND
raced well off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and steadily improved off the rail on the far turn then dug in to take third later yards. THORN OF
ROSE HILL entered the opening turn in the five path then angled in and settled off the pace inside from the half mile pole, picked up the chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths and finished evenly. FOREVER TAKES TIME rated the early pace inside then came
under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn but was caught inside the eighth pole and weakened. FONEY saved ground
the first turn then bid toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the seven path and passed some rivals. ITSAHATTATACK stalked the pace
off the rail then picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, though, flattened stride about the three path of the far turn. MODERN COWPOKE rated
off the pace about the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then faded toward the far turn. MY FINAL NINJA was not a
factor. CESAR AUGUSTO stalked the early pace then gave chase from the three eighths pole, but gave way in the five path of the far turn.

Footnotes
MISS GRANDSTANDER became a bit anxious in the gate and broke awkwardly then forced inward and into Cook The Books shortly after the break,
accelerated to the front at the three eighths pole, drew clear past the five sixteenths, widened at the rail on the turn then steadily encouraged down the lane.
MISS WAVE chased the pace through the backstretch and was forced eight wide on the turn, lugged in a path and made light contact with Castle Review
past the eighth pole then finished well. TAPTAP gave chase off the rail and left the turn in the five path, angled to the outside past the eighth pole and
finished evenly. CASTLE REVIEW raced hemmed in most of the backstretch then angled seven wide on the turn, was jostled past the eighth pole but came
back to finish evenly. SINGING HARMONY broke outward to make contact with Cook The Books then picked up the chase through the backstretch,
rounded the turn in the five path, exchanged light contact with Castle Review past the eighth pole then flattened stride. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE became
unruly leaving the paddock which necessitated a late rider change, gave close early chase toward the inside, rounded the turn near the rail then weakened.
COOK THE BOOKS was jostled leaving the gate and raced well back. DIANATHEHUNTRESS set a pressured pace most of the opening three sixteenths
then gave chase from the three eighths pole, though weakened at the rail on the turn. NOT FOR GOLD ducked in at the break and picked up the chase,
rounded the turn about the three path but gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
ON THIS DAY contested the pace between horses and two deep, continued the duel at even terms on the turn and dug in gamely to turn back Bucked
Tooth while just holding off UNION GRACE who gave chase and rounded the turn in the five path, drifted a bit into the lane but dug in with a strong bid and
just missed. BUCKED TOOTH contested the pace inside and raced at even terms nearest the rail on the turn, then reluctantly ceded later yards. EQUUS
NOVUS pressured the pace three wide and loomed close in the four path of the turn, then finished evenly. LATE CALLER chased the pace outside, rounded
the turn in the six path and finished evenly. RUTH LESS BLUE came in at the break then picked up the chase inside, rounded the turn off the rail and
flattened stride later yards. THE GREAT MCHENRY was shuffled back on the chute and angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn in the seven
path and showed little more. GUNS AND ROSIES gave chase off the rail then weakened on the turn. ROLLING BROOK chased the pace inside then
weakened at the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
STOWE ANGEL rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. CHIEF RANDEL
settled just off the pace then bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path though had to settle for second best. BRIGHT
DAWN saved ground off the pace then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and flattened stride. TAKE TIME
broke awkwardly then saved ground the first turn, eased outward into the backstretch and bid nearing the three eighths pole, but weakened in the four path
of the far turn and steadied off the outside flank of Hypothesis. CUBIC SOUND raced four wide the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response.
HYPOTHESIS stalked the pace from the two and three paths then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, showed no response on the far turn,
took what appeared to be an awkward step at the eighth pole and eased.

QUEEN NEKIA settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn then eased slightly outward into the backstretch, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn at the rail then dug in at the outside flank of the runner-up leaving the eighth pole to take the lead mid-stretch then edged clear under
the wire. LADY T N T tapered to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, dueled clear midway on the far turn and
was steadily handled leaving the turn, but was caught inside the sixteenth pole and reluctantly ceded. GETOUTTAMYWAY settled off the pace toward the
inside then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, eased four wide on the far turn and finished evenly to take third later yards. DECOUPAGE
raced in tight at the rail most of the front stretch and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn
about the five path then flattened stride the final furlong. A BIT OF BOTH stalked the pace from the two path and challenged the runner-up leaving the three
eighths pole, but dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened the final sixteenth. FIGURE IT OUT raced in the four path the first turn and left the turn

SLEEPY EYES TODD took the lead into the opening turn and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole,
widened at the rail on the far turn then drew away under steady handling. PLUS QUE PARFAIT rated just off the pace in the four and five paths then took
aim nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn but proved no match in the lane and settled for second best. RUNNIN'TOLUVYA
settled back off the rail then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid from the seven sixteenths pole and improved in the four path of the far turn, then
dug in under steady encouragement and just held on for third. TENFOLD raced well back toward the inside then bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole,
came through the far turn about the seven path, finished well and just missed third. MATH WIZARD saved early ground then bid toward the three eighths
pole, angled to the six path on the far turn and raced evenly down the lane. MO DONT NO raced just off the early pace inside, picked up the chase toward
the seven sixteenths pole but flattened stride while losing ground on the far turn. FOREWARNED raced well back off the rail then eased outward into the
backstretch, showed little response down the backstretch but finished evenly toward the rail. WAR STORY settled off the pace in the four and five paths, bid
toward the three eighths pole and came through the far turn in the six path but showed little more. MULTIPLIER rated close off the rail and picked up the
chase toward the three eighths pole, but dropped back on the far turn and weakened into the lane. MR. MONEY settled close to the early pace in the three
and four paths then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened on the far turn.
