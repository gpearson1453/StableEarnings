Footnotes
JULIUS sped to the front, cleared and angled in to take the rail position, opened up on the backstretch, drifted out into the stretch while still leading
comfortably, led clear through the lane under right-handed urging, weakened a bit inside the sixteenth pole but held off the runner-up. JUSTIN'S QUEST
chased outside a rival and two wide into the stretch, rallied inside the winner late but was not enough. BLAME IT ON KITTY asked right-handed soon after
the start, traveled three wide through the final turn, came with a mild late bid and earned the show. SECRET TOUCH stalked JULIUS from the inside,
moved off the rail a bit, raced two then three wide into the stretch and went one-paced to the wire. ZESTFUL tracked the winner along the inside, saved
ground into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
KLEEN KARMA tucked inside, closed in around the far turn, swung four wide into the lane, forced out in upper stretch, headed the runner-up a sixteenth out
and drew clear. INVINCIBELLA (GB) stalked between rivals, bumped with SAPORI GIRL nearing the three-eighths, bid three deep into the stretch, bumped
by SAPORI GIRL in upper stretch, gained command near the furlong marker but yielded to the winner in the final sixteenth. SAPORI GIRL stalked inside,
bumped with rival at the three-eighths, bid between entering the stretch, lugged out and bumped again in upper stretch, then got oukicked in the late stages.
RED BUNTING (IRE) trailed early from the inside, tipped out into the two path, angled in around the far turn and went evenly through the stretch for a minor
award. KALLINIKI controlled the pace from along the rail, led clear to the quarter pole, challenged leaving the bend and vied inside to the lane but weakened
in the drive. GALLANTLYSTREAMING (IRE) broke out, went four wide into the first turn then angled in some, raced off the rail into the far turn, angled three
wide around that bend, saved ground into the stretch but proved no menace. BRAHMS COMMAND tracked three deep, angled in on the second turn, came
three wide into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
POSITIVITY bumped leaving the gate, came in and bumped TOUCHDOWN BROWN early, chased four wide around the turn, closed fast and reeled in
GOOD WITH PEOPLE from the outside to get up in the final strides. GOOD WITH PEOPLE sped to the front from the inside, padded the lead into the lane,
led well clear through the drive, weakened a bit late and could not hold off the winner. SCOOBY settled off the rail, raced wide into the turn, four wide into
the lane, urged left-handed and picked up the show. NONE ABOVE THE LAW broke out and bumped at the start, steadied briefly off heels early, bumped
with rival at the seven-sixteenths, raced off the rail to the stretch and showed a mild response. RANTANEN away quickly from the outside, settled off the
pace, bumped with NONE ABOVE THE LAW at the seven-sixteenths, took the turn three wide and lacked a response. JAZZ HANDS off a bit slow then
rushed up to attend the pace outside the leader, chased off the rail, drifted out upper stretch and weakened. TOUCHDOWN BROWN bumped and steadied
early, angled to the inside, angled five wide leaving the turn and failed to rally. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THE FILM WAS
INCONCLUSIVE TO WHETHER POSITIVITY COST TOUCHDOWN BROWN A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE NO
CHANGE. HAND TIMED.

WATCH ME BURN went up to challenge from the inside, dueled with RED LIVY for command, led into the stretch, cleared briefly then held gamely in a
driving finish. LUCKY PERIDOT broke in and bumped rival, settled outside a foe, went three wide around the turn, came out into the stretch, closed outside
the winner but was too late. SWIRLING stalked outside a rival, raced three then two wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the lane, rallied but could not
match the top pair in the final furlong. DEVILS DANCE off slow to begin, reserved and angled to travel a bit off the rail, angled in around the turn, steered
out into the stretch stretch, angled out further mid-stretch and passed tired rivals. SEASIDE DANCER stalked a bit off the rail, saved ground into the lane
and weakened. RED LIVY (IRE) bumped from the outside leaving the gate, sped to the front then dueled for the lead outside of WATCH ME BURN, fought
back but weakened in the final furlong.

SOOTHING took command early and moved to the inside, inched away on the backstretch, saved ground into the lane, urged right-handed approaching the
eighth pole, drew away and ridden out to the wire. TRUE MISCHIEF pressed outside, stalked up the backstretch, ridden along on the far turn, took aim
leaving the turn, saw the leader kick away in the stretch but proved second best. GOTTA BE LUCKY chased inside, two to three wide into the stretch, then
kept on for a clear third. MOREAVINO settled off the pace, angled in on the far turn, saved ground into the stretch and was along for a minor award. OUR
ROMANCE four wide into the first turn, angled at the three-eighths then steered back out and came four wide into the stretch and improved position. WHAT
A FAMILY went four then three wide on the firs turn, stalked two wide around the second bend and into the stretch, then weakened in the drive. SAPPHIRE
SILK stalked off the rail, went three wide around the far turn and also weakened. POLAR ROUTE settled off the pace, tracked off the rail, between at the
seven-sixteenths, dropped back on the far turn and tired. TURKISH ANGEL stumbled badly leaving the gate, raced off the rail and was never a factor. OUR
BONNIE LASS in tight and steadied between early, three wide into the first turn then angled in a path, came out near the half-mile marker, went three deep
at the seven-sixteenths, dropped back on the last turn, came into the stretch well off the inside and tired.

ROLL UP MO MONEY in range of the top pair from the outside, bid three deep at the three-eighths, vied for command through the turn, dueled three wide
with BONUS FEVER, cleared mid-stretch then held safely in the closing moments. MOONLIGHT D'ORO chased off the rail, two wide into the stretch, split
foes in the lane, finished with a late bid and edged ROYAL BLEND for the place. ROYAL BLEND settled off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and got
outkicked for the place. BRILLIANT CUT well placed behind the early trio, traveled two wide then three wide into the lane, angled out upper stretch and
lacked the needed late punch. BONUS FEVER broke in and bumped at the start, dueled outside a rival then vied between, dueled with the winner into the
stretch and weakened in the lane. SHANGHAI GROOVE chased the pace to the turn, saved ground around the bend, angled out and showed a mild
response to improve position. HIGH CON dueled inside then vied with a pair of rivals around the turn, could not keep up nearing the quarter pole and gave
way. FRAZZLED off slow to begin, trailed off the inside, three wide into the stretch, came in some in the drive and never threatened. FROSTED BLUE
bumped by rival at the start, went three then four wide around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
MICRORITHMS away fastest, vied between for the lead, held a short advantage through the turn, drifted a furlong out and had the rider lose the whip just
past the eighth pole, hand urged late and held gamely. JAMMING EDDY six deep early, vied four deep around the turn and into the stretch, lost contact with
the winner mid-stretch then came back in the final sixteenth but was too late. BIG SCOTT DADDY lacked early speed, took the turn two to three wide, came
out in the stretch and summoned a late bid. OIL CAN KNIGHT vied for the lead from the inside, saved ground around the turn, steadied briefly when the
winner drifted in at the eighth pole and lost the show. DROP THE CHALUPA bumped at the start, raced five deep early, vied three deep around the turn,
kept on through the drive but was outfinished. ALLEVA broke out, showed early speed three deep, could not keep pace and chased into the turn, came out
around the bend and tired. SILARDI stumbled badly at the start then rushed up to vie for the lead, lost ground approaching the half-mile pole, dropped back
on the turn and faded.

AWESOME DRIVE tight and steadied briefly into the first turn, tucked inside around that bend, settled off the pace, angled out on the far turn then further
out in the stretch, surged late three deep and nailed COLOMBIAN GOLD at the wire. COLOMBIAN GOLD bumped leaving the gate, raced two wide then
reserved outside a rival, angled three wide then steered out in the stretch, rallied to take a short lead with a sixteenth left, bumped with WHITE VELVET late
and got nailed at the wire. WHITE VELVET stalked outside a rival, tipped out into the stretch, bid three deep and between rivals inside the furlong grounds,
bumped COLOMBIAN GOLD late and finished game third. LADY NOGUEZ bumped leaving the gate, unhurried a bit off the rail, went four wide into the
stretch and was edged for the show. TOO MUCH HEAVEN stalked three wide, pressed the leader near the seven-sixteenths, headed rival at the quarter
pole, brushed with SAVVY GAL in the lane and was outfinished in deep stretch. SAVVY GAL sped to the front and set the pace inside, dueled with TOO
MUCH HEAVEN around the far turn and into the lane, fought back inside, brushed with TOO MUCH HEAVEN and weakened late. A THOUSAND DREAMS
in range of the leader in the pocket, came out a bit in the lane and weakened in the final furlong. BREAKFAST BALL mid-pack outside a rival, traveled two
wide then came out a bit in the stretch and lacked a bid. DON'T STOP LOOKIN also raced mid-pack but from the inside, saved ground into the lane and

Footnotes
FIGHTING MAD took control early, set the pace a bit off the rail, showed the way in the two path leaving the far turn, remained clear through the lane under
right-handed urging and held off the late bid from OLLIE'S CANDY in the final strides. OLLIE'S CANDY stalked FIGHTING MAD a bit off the rail then two
wide on the backstretch, asked around the final bend, put to right-handed at the three-sixteenths, chased the winner down the stretch, switched to the
left-hand and kicked in a late bid but was not enough. CE CE bumped soon after the start, chased off the rail, four wide into the lane, could not make an
impact on the top pair but finished a clear third. HANG A STAR traveled along the inside, came out into the stretch and bested the rest. DOGTAG chased
the pace from the inside, lost ground around the far turn and faded out of contention. HARD NOT TO LOVE shifted in and bumped CE CE soon after the
start, settled off the rail, entered the stretch four wide and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
TALLIEN (IRE) settled outside a rival, bothered by inside rival coming out at the five-sixteenths, urged left-handed around the bend came three wide into the
stretch, moved out in the stretch, reeled in the leader and drove clear. WAR PATH stalked inside, angled out at the five-sixteenths, traveled three to four
wide into the lane, angled to the inside in the drive and finished well for the place. HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR stalked off the rail, bid three deep into the far
turn, dueled into the stretch, moved clear at the eighth pole but got caught deep stretch. FRASARD (GB) reserved inside, angled out nearing the quarter
pole, came out in the stretch and rallied late. WESTERN SMOKE controlled the pace and crossed to the inside, responded when challenged on the far turn,
vied inside then dueled with HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. VEGAS MOON settled outside a rival then off the
rail, went three wide into the lane and made no impact. JUROR off bit slow to begin, raced outside a rival early then tucked inside on the first turn, moved a
bit off the rail on the backstretch, lacked room approaching the three-eights pole, entered the lane a bit off the rail then angled to fence and was always
outrun. PORT SAINT JOE tracked inside, two wide into the lane and was never a factor. IT BETTER BE GOLD up close to the outside of the pace setter,
went between runners into the far turn, steadied between at the five-sixteenths and retreated into the stretch.
