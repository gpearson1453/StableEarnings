Footnotes
MOONLINE prompted the pace two wide, inched forward and vied into the turn, forged an advantage turning for home and built a clear margin in upper
stretch, then held PERFECTLY MAJESTIC at bay through the late stages, and lasted. PERFECTLY MAJESTIC tracked from midpack, advanced in the five
path and outside of horses passing the five sixteenths pole, then sustained his rally through the lane, but did not have enough to catch the tiring leader.
TOOTHPIC raced far off of the pace in the five to six path around the turn, then stayed on mildly through the late stages for a minor reward. SUMMERDUCK
chased the leaders from the three path, but was outmoved by a wider foe turning for home, then kept on without producing a bid before getting outfinished
for show. ODIE set the pace inside of MOONLINE, dueled for the lead inside of that foe around the turn, but weakened passing the quarter pole. YOUNG
CORBETT saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. RUNMALIBURUN was never involved. BABADOOOK was forwardly placed four wide and
outside of foes, but weakened between horses turning for home. MONSIEUR BROWN briefly showed interest along the rail in the opening furlong, but
weakened into the turn, was done early, and subsequently stopped.

Footnotes
NEVER EVEN CALLED bumped with an inner foe at the start, was forwardly placed along the inside, surpassed outer stalking foes to forge place passing
the half mile pole before shifting to the two path into the far turn, tracked the leader from just off of his flank around that bend, then made a bid for the lead at
the furlong pole as that foe tired, and held OUT COLD and PERFECT BEAM's late bids at bay. OUT COLD tracked from midpack in the three path around
the first turn, advanced to striking range four to three wide down the backstretch, then tracked outside of the eventual winner around the far turn, then
sustained his grind through the late stages, but was fended off by that rival at the wire. PERFECT BEAM saved ground far off of the pace, and offered a
good kick along the rail through the lane, but ran out of ground and missed placee. REVEREND AJ cleared off early on, held an advantage turning for home
inside of bidding foes, but drifted out while tiring in midstretch, then was headed and weakened in the final sixteenth. AQUALITYINDIVIDUAL bumped with
an outer foe at the start, then saved ground in midpack around the turns, and failed to menace. GIANT'S FORREST stalked along the inside, but was
outmoved by an inner foe down the backstretch, and weakened into the far turn. MARKET GARDEN raced far off of the pace in the four path around the first
turn,advanced four wide into the far turn, but flattened out and failed to make an impact. CHANNELEDSLONGSHOT saved ground far off the pace, then
commenced a rally between horses in upper stretch, but was stymied behind traffic in midstretch, and failed to menace. CHANNEL ISLAND raced far off of
the pace three to four wide and failed to factor. GLITTER CAT trailed early on, and was never involved. WITCH DOCTOR was caught in the four path in
midpack around the first turn, and was done ealry. CHANNEL STRIKE stalked two to three wide, but weakened into the far turn, and stopped.

Footnotes
COLONEL MOON stalked three wide, bid in the the far turn before assuming command passing the five sixteenths pole, shifted in approaching the three
sixteenths pole while clearing his inner rival, the dug in through the lane as that foe kept on, and held under driving pressure. PURPLE SHIRT set the pace
along the inside, felt pressure from a pair of foes into the far turn, proved no match for COLONEL MOON passing the five sixteenths pole, shifted outside of
that foe after that rival cleared approaching the five sixteenths pole, then kept on through the lane to make a rebid, but failed to regain even term, and was
second best. BOAT WAMPUM saved ground from far off the pace, then offered a mild rally along the rail to achieve show at the sixteenth pole without
threatening the leaders. FHACO advanced mildly past tired foes in the three to four path around the far turn to forge show at the five sixteenths pole, but
was outfinished for that position in the final stages. C J'S I'M BYU stalked two wide, but came under a drive at the half mile pole as COLONEL MOON
moved along side, then weakened between horses at the three furlong pole. DAKOTA JUSTICE was off a step slow, tracked from midpack along the inside,
but was done early, eased through the far turn, and showed little.
