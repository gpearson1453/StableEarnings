the second turn, was three wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and tired. CHARLIE'S A. T. M. was allowed to settle early, got fanned four
wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. FRENCH TUDOR stalked the winner from the rail for six furlongs then tired. VICTORY COMMAND

Footnotes
NARDINI chased the pace to the turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch then held off SING IN THE WIND stubbornly. SING
IN THE WIND had no speed, was off the rail into the turn then swung out five deep into the stretch and finished willingly late. BLACK DROP had good
speed, set the pace in the two path to the stretch but was collared in mid stretch and weakened. CHIRP chased the leader to the turn then was outside of
SING IN THE WIND and forced to circle six wide to the stretch and did not threaten. BABE DIDRIKSON got outsprinted to the turn, was four wide to the
stretch then lacked a closing response. PROMOTE (IRE) hustled to attend the pace early, saved ground to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
MAGICAL PATH was unhurried for a half, bid three then four wide on the second turn, rallied to the front in mid stretch and drove clear. HEATSKY pressed
the pace for six furlongs while two wide, responded and had the lead briefly but was collared by the winner then dug in gamely to save the place. KAYDA
had no speed, settled for a half mile, circled rivals five wide on the second turn while rallying to the stretch then was outfinished by the winner and could not
get by the runnerup. FOGGY BOTTOM was chasing to the half, bid three then four wide on the second turn to loom a threat to the stretch but slackened
leaving mid stretch. GOLDEN GODDESS was also chasing the pace, raced two wide on the far turn and lacked a closing response. ENDLESS STORY had
no speed, trailed to the stretch and was not a factor. CULTURED PEARL got outsprinted early, saved ground on both turns but weakened in the stretch.
PAJAMA QUEEN hustled to the lead, set the pace from the rail for six furlongs then gave out.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA COMET was outrun to the turn, circled four then five wide to the stretch then responded when set down, closed with a good run and held off
EDDIE'S PRINCESS late. EDDIE'S PRINCESS was outsprinted early, came three wide to mid turn then eased in to the rail, closed willingly and was easily
second best. MAMANUCA had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch then could not impact the top two while grabbing the show dough. LADIES LUV
MUNNY hustled to set a pressured pace from the rail to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then tired. GIFTY tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch,
got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. PLEASE ZIP IT was chasing to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response.
LYDIA O LYDIA had no speed, made up some ground while saving ground to mid stretch then also finished evenly. SUPER BUNNY stalked the leaders two
wide to the stretch but got outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. WAY TOO SWEET attended the pace outside of LADIES LUV MUNNY and two wide to
the stretch then tired.
