Footnotes
BEE MAJOR tucked in behind the leaders for nearly six furlongs, moved through between horses to lodge a bid at the top of the stretch, outdueled
UNCAGE THE CAT through the furlong grounds and pulled clear. UNCAGE THE CAT broke out, settled in striking range three wide early, rallied past rivals
four wide around the far turn, dueled outside BEE MAJOR through upper stretch and came up second best. KING ANDRES saved ground in the middle of
the pack early, steadied lacking room approaching the top of the stretch, moved to the two-path finding clearance, and rallied mildly to go clear of the rest.
ALPERES raced well back early three wide, moved out a bit further putting in a mild run past the quarter-pole, but flattened out. BIG TREASURE hit the
right side of the gate at the start, lacked room behind a wall of horses turning for home, and posed no threat. IAMBUTTER got pushed out by UNCAGE THE
CAT at the start, lagged well back for six furlongs, and passed tired horses. FUTURE PRINCE hit the left side of the gate and was off slowest, took the first
turn four wide near the back, moved inside and remained outrun. EXPRESS BOY saved ground early, and was never in the hunt. INACEPTABLE dueled for
command outside CHURCHILLS VICTORY to the far turn, and gave way. IMPERIAL GREATNESS tracked outside the leaders to the far turn, and tired.
FAYEZ was finished early. CHURCHILLS VICTORY dueled inside INACEPTABLE early, and steadied giving way to challengers a quarter-mile out.

Footnotes
TARA sat just off dueling leaders, ranged up to challenge in the three-path outside STARSHIP VOYAGER midway on the turn, battled through a long drive
and prevailed in the closing yards. STARSHIP VOYAGER lost her footing at the break but was away alertly, dueled early inside SEATTLE BAY, responded
when hooked from outside by TARA past the three-eighths, and fought gamely to the finish. TIZ ENOUGH had aim off the leaders outside turning for home,
narrowed the gap late but was never seriously involved. RIVETING SPIRIT was never close, and drifted five or six wide into the stretch. COOL STANCE
was finished early inside. SEATTLE BAY dueled outside STARSHIP VOYAGE for nearly three furlongs, and stopped.

Footnotes
GENERIC MARK saved ground unhurried to the top of the stretch, tipped out getting in gear once straightened away, and overpowered KARENINA from
outside late. KARENINA was forwardly placed from the start, took over outside SLEWYS CHOSEN ONE turning for home, pulled clear through mid stretch,
drifted out and could not hold off the winner. ELITE APPEAL saved ground for six furlongs, came two wide rallying mildly into the stretch, and did not have
enough. CHEROKEE SOUND went along between horses in midpack early, moved inside around the far turn, got steered out entering the final furlong and
offered a mild response. ZANDREA'S raced three wide in range to the top of the lane, and lacked the needed bid. TRIESTE (BRZ) was no factor in the
second flight throughout. SLEWYS CHOSEN ONE set the pace inside, could not handle KARENINA into the lane and gave way. LEMON WATER was
always outrun. TENNESSEE COTTON was outrun three to four wide on the turns. CAPELINE chased the pacesetter two wide to the far turn, and tired.
KISSES FOR TIZZY hit the left side of the gate at the start, raced wide and was outrun. AMBER PRINCESS was four wide on the first turn, and retired
early.

Footnotes
SEAZAN was driven four wide midway on the turn, got out-moved by the leaders into the stretch, stayed on task brushing with ANOTHER DUKE past the
eighth-pole, and was along late outside. ANOTHER DUKE went along between horses off the first flight early, moved out brushing with SEAZAN through
mid stretch, and finished willingly inside that rival getting up for second. IMPERIAL KING vied inside HALCYON DIGEST and HONESTO early, shook those
two off and dealt with a challenge from COBB going by the quarter-pole, edged away through the furlong grounds, and stayed on to deep stretch before
yielding. COBB was taken off the inside early, moved menacingly five wide around the turn, could not get past IMPERIAL KING through upper stretch and
flattened out. WICKED BRODY trailed for better than a half-mile, and passed tired horses. HALCYON DIGEST vied for command early between horses,
and gave way soon after completing a half. HONESTO vied outside rivals for a half, and tired. FOSTER HOPE was through early inside.

BURN THE BOATS bumped with NOTSOSUBTLE at the start, saved ground in the middle of the field early, continued inside advancing after six furlongs,
moved out drawing a bead on the leaders in the three-path through upper stretch, and got past SPEED FRANCO late. SPEED FRANCO prompted the pace
outside VALIANT VIRTUE for six furlongs, took over in upper stretch, and could not withstand the winner while remaining clear of the rest. SHENDAM (FR)
improved position inside on the far turn, moved off the rail approaching the stretch, and finished well between horses to get up for the show. UNCLE CURLY
stayed close inside for six furlongs, came three wide into the lane, and finished one-paced. VALIANT VIRTUE set a manageable pace inside for six furlongs,
and gave way through the stretch. MIGHTY GHOST was outrun to the stretch, and gained mildly outside late without threatening. DRILLOMATIC was
finished early. NOTSOSUBTLE became fractious unseating the rider behind the gate, bumped with BURN THE BOATS at the start, was hard to handle
going to the first turn and had to be taken out four wide, moved up mildly after a half-mile, and gave way soon after that. DILLON ROCKS raced three then
two wide early, and tired before reaching the stretch.

SIR KAHN battled inside SPEIGHTSTOWN AGAIN and EASY DAY for a half-mile, and turned back the latter through the lane for a hard-fought decision.
EASY DAY vied three wide for a half, could not get past SIR KAHN through a long drive and was clearly second best. SPEIGHTSTOWN AGAIN argued the
pace between horses to the quarter-pole, dropped back into the stretch, moved outside and held the show. DEFEATSNOTANOPTION eyed the leading trio
four wide on the turn, and tired outside through the lane. NO MORE BUSINESS brushed with DIVINE CONTROL after the start, and raced far back
throughout. DIVINE CONTROL brushed the left side of the gate coming out, then brushed with NO MORE BUSINESS, and was always far back.

FOG WARNING sprinted clear early, rated along well off the rail, and faced no challenges through the lane under a drive. SLIPPY chased outside the
winner from the start, weakened through the late stages but had enough to save second. RAGS FOR BRITCHES broke out, moved up mildly around the
turn four wide, and could not gain through the stretch on the far outside. TEXTPECTATION got shut off behind RAGS FOR BRITCHES at the start, lagged
well back two wide to the stretch, and passed tired horses. NORTHBROOK broke in a bit, was corrected and came out brushing EXATLON after the start,
raced four wide and tired after a half-mile. EXATLON brushed with NORTHBROOK after the start, raced three to four wide, and was outrun. GATOR FIFTY
TWO chased early inside, tired around the turn, and drifted out through mid stretch. ELITE MISSION gave way abruptly four wide on the turn. OUR TIME
stayed in range for a half two wide, and stopped.

Footnotes
MILLIONAIRE RUNNER was a step slow at the start, threaded his way through between horses advancing midway on the far turn, waited briefly at the top
of the lane, split horses in the stretch and drove clear. KAHRAMANI was outrun early, circled five wide late on the far turn, fought his way to a short lead in
the stretch, but was outfinished. JAY'S WAY set a pressured pace to the stretch, and weakened inside. SENSATIONAL RIDE lost position four wide after a
half-mile, and rallied mildly on the far outside to just miss the show. BLAME THE THIEF bumped lightly with JAIDEN'S BEST at the start, was hustled along
five then four wide around the first turn, tracked outside the battling leaders, came under a ride three wide on the far turn, and weakened between horses
through mid stretch. JAIDEN'S BEST bumped lightly with BLAME THE THIEF at the start, was four then three wide on the first turn, took closer order after
six furlongs, stalled behind a wall of horses at the top of the lane, moved inside and was empty when clear. DONE ACTING was no factor three wide.
UNBRIDLED HOLIDAY tired inside after six furlongs. TWO STEP SLEW pressed the pace outside JAY'S WAY, and gave way approaching the stretch.

GO JO JO GO bumped with SOPHISTICURL at the start, lagged well back early, began moving on the turn gradually shifting out to be five wide, rallied
through the lane on the far outside, reached the front past the 70-yard marker and drew clear. PRINCESS SECRET set the pace in the two-path, got
overhauled from outside by FREAK in upper stretch, and battled back gamely to best that rival for the runner-up spot. FREAK moved fast four wide late on
the turn, wrested command outside PRINCESS SECRET past the three-sixteenths, edged clear with a furlong remaining, but weakened in the final stages.
ALLURAMORE raced in range for a half-mile in the two-path, and lacked a solid response through the lane. SOPHISTICURL bumped with GO JO JO GO at
the start, chased inside early, and faded through the stretch on the rail. LYRICAL pressed the pace outside PRINCESS SECRET, challenged from midway
on the turn to the quarter-pole, and gave way. TAMIAMI was outrun four wide. SOCIAL EXCLUSION showed speed for a quarter-mile, and dropped back on
the turn three wide.

Footnotes
BREEZE ON BY sped to the front off the rail, shook off BOCA BOY heading into the turn, got hooked by GATSBY after a half-mile, moved to the rail and
battled through a long drive staying on his left lead, and was edging away again late. GATSBY stayed close early, moved to challenge outside BREEZE ON
BY nearing the quarter-pole, drifted out entering the final furlong and settled for second best. BOCA BOY came in after the start bumping with LITTLE
DEMON, chased four wide into the turn, and could not keep pace with the leaders after a half-mile. FAMOUS GENT moved up around the turn four wide,
but could not sustain the rally. LITTLE DEMON bumped with BOCA BOY after the start, and was outrun three to four wide. SON OF A BEAST was outrun
five wide. MR TINGLES showed brief speed outside, and dropped back through the turn. VALIANT THOR broke awkwardly and bumped with CASALSA,
then checked in tight between that one and LITTLE DEMON, bumped with CASALSA again entering the turn, and dropped far back. CASALSA broke out
and bumped solidly with VALIANT THOR, bumped with the latter again entering the turn, dropped far back and was eased up in the lane.

Footnotes
NINETYDAYSOFWINTER pressed the pace along the rail, took over from LIGHT FURY turning for home, and drifted out and in while clear. O DRISCOLL
became edgy in the gate dislodging the rider, raced five wide under a drive from midway on the turn, and was along for the place. POWER (BRZ) pressed
the pace three wide, lacked a solid closing response, and was much best of the remainder. LIGHT FURY broke in and slammed MAKINALEGACY, went up
to set the pace in the two-path pressed from both sides, and gave way after six furlongs. MAKINALEGACY hit the right side of the gate and was clobbered
between LIGHT FURY and BULKCARRIER at the start, put in a four-wide run advancing after a half-mile, but could not sustain the rally. PACHANGA
PATROL was no factor. INITFORTHELOVE got riled up alongside O DRISCOLL in the gate, stumbled badly at the break, and was finished after a half.
STARSHIP MUFASA stayed in range early, and tired around the turn three wide. BULKCARRIER broke out smashing into MAKINALEGACY, showed brief
speed and was through entering the turn.
