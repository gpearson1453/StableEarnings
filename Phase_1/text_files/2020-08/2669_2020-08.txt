drove clear. OVERKOTER dueled for the lead along the inside throughout the backstretch, entered turn along the rail and through the turn, responded to
urging and gamely kept on holding second. HE LIKES CURVES chased dueling leaders along the inside, stayed along the inside throughout the turn,
responded to urging staging a mild rally along the rail. MALIBU MAGIC chased leaders in between rivals on the backside, entered turn two wide, swung out
into stretch, entered stretch in the six path, responded to urging and finished a willing fourth. ZINZAN dueled outside of rival on the backside, entered turn
two wide, entered stretch in the three path, and lacked needed response in the lane. CHIEFTAIN'S LAD broke well and lacked speed while settling at the
rear of the field, entered turn off the rail and into the stretch, lacked any response and coasted to the wire.
