hustled three-wide on the far turn, launched an all out stretch drive, gained steadily and just missed. OUR UNCLE DREW, in range, stalked from the rail to
two-wide on the far turn, bid upper stretch but was outfinished. ICOMEFROMDOWNTOWN, in range, came three and four-wide through the far turn, bid a
furlong out, battled briefly and weakened late. HIGHRISEINTHEPEG settled in mid pack, came through the far turn along the rail and two-wide then finished
under a determined drive. FINAL STRIKE pulled to striking range early on the backstretch, lapped onto the leader late backstretch, dueled on the turn, took
the lead at the top of the stretch but was engaged by several rivals and gave way. RANGE OF MOTION broke in the air and settled well off the pace,
chased on the far turn, closed a gap but never reached contention. SAMUEL H raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the far turn but failed to
menace. UNWAVERING forced the pace, drew clear midway through the backstretch, dueled on the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch and faded.
WATCHNSEE had speed, was headed early backstretch and dropped back a bit, retreated from late turn, was eased in the stretch, crossed the wire and
walked off.

Footnotes
POWER HOUSE was on hold chasing the open length leader, not being set down and asked until upper stretch, collared the front runner at the eighth pole
and went clear, holding a safe margin to the wire. OUR EYES TOUCHED sat along the rail in mid pack, was hustled to move into range from midturn to
upper stretch, seemed to stall down the lane but re-rallied and got up on the wire for the place spot. WILBURNRUBBER controlled the lead while held
setting a very soft pace, held the advantage to the eighth pole but stayed on her wrong lead to the wire, passed late for the place position. POST TO POST
was near the rear throughout before tipping widest into the stretch, bested the balance but her closing kick was wasted in a paceless race. CLAIRESSENCE
was off the pace early, came running with a three to four wide turn of foot to loom dangerous turning for home but levelled off in the later stages, the pace
quickening down the lane. WHAT'S IN A KISS (IRE) along the rail and off the pace down the backside, rallied into traffic late on the turn inside, then was
closing well before losing her path and steadying hard on the fence in the final seventy yards, costing her a higher finish for sure. HANCHY settled in mid
pack, was two to three wide on the bend and moving up between rivals, seemed uncomfortable in a little tight in upper stretch and had no response late.

Footnotes
PICCADILLY BEAU stalked the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide late on the far turn, challenged in the final furlong and drove clear. LAUDERDALE
forced the pace under strong restraint, bid two-wide late on the final turn, led upper stretch, was engaged in the final furlong and was outfinished. FRIGHT
NIGHT, pinched back at the start, encountered traffic at the clubhouse turn and ducked out from rail to five-wide, settled off the pace, closed two and
three-wide on the far turn then rallied gamely between foes. ITSTARTSWITHADRINK was forced out at the first turn, raced in mid pack, chased two-wide
into the stretch and finished evenly. SEEMEE, off slowly, settled in mid pack, was hustled four and five-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch but
evened out in the late stages. FLASH OF SILVER set a pressured pace, dueled on the far turn, was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way
grudgingly. PRISON PADRE was steadied in traffic caused by a choked down pace approaching the clubhouse turn, settled of the pace, was hustled
two-wide on the far turn but failed to menace. JUST RUN WITH IT raced in mid pack, was hustled four to six-wide on the far turn but was never in
contention. SOFIA'S SLUGGER got away a step slowly, stalked the pace, chased three-wide on the far turn then tired in the stretch.

STREET LEGAL stalked the pace, chased two-wide into the stretch, gained steadily, challenged approaching the 16th pole and drove clear. AM
PREPARED lost his path leaving the gate when he was herded in behind TISHINA by DUPES, settled in mid pack, came two to four-wide through the turn
then rallied gamely from the outside. FORESTER'S DESTINY settled in mid pack, closed angling from the rail to three-wide through the turn, rallied gamely
but was outgunned for place. SPANISH RIVER forced the pace, took the lead entering the turn, drew clear, was caught in the final furlong and gave way.
TISHINA set a pressured pace, was headed at the turn, chased into the stretch and evened out in the late stages. DUPES broke outward, stalked the pace,
came through the turn along the rail then two-wide and chased in the stretch. UNCLE GRUMPY stalked the pace, chased hard two-wide late turn then
finished evenly. FOLLOW MY LEAD raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn but never reached contention. CAPTAIN SIDNEY settled in mid
pack, dropped back early turn, was hustled along but had no closing response. MAGICAL BREEZE was unhurried early, angled out from the rail to
three-wide on the turn, swung out further at the top of the stretch but was empty when asked.
