Footnotes
WICKED SUNSET was sent for speed, set the pace to the turn, met SOMARA'S bid nearing the quarter pole, edged away to mid stretch and held driving.
MOSCATO GIRL stalked the winner from the rail to the stretch, could not impact that one but gamely bested GAMBLER'S APPEAL for second.
GAMBLER'S APPEAL was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then battled MOSCATO GIRL for the place but hung in the late stages.
SOMARA pressed the winner to the turn, pushed up to be on terms at the quarter pole but got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. CATTERING was
outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
MAD AT MONEY was content in the back of the pack for a half mile, bid two wide into the second turn, closed willingly then eased out in upper stretch,
rallied steadily and was along in time. LUCKY GENERAL was settled to the half mile pole, raced three wide to the stretch, got on terms in mid stretch, could
not shake MR. MAGICO, dug in but was nailed on the line. MR. MAGICO attended the pace two wide for six furlongs, inched away to the stretch then was
collared in mid stretch, refused to budge but was bested in the final strides. EL BORRACHO stalked the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the
stretch then finished steadily. DADDY JONES dueled inside for six furlongs, was outkicked to mid stretch and tired. ALLEYCAT was unhurried inside the
winner to the half, was three wide on the second turn but lacked the needed late response.

HOUSE OF TARGARYEN chased the leaders two then three wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid stretch and pushed clear. LAWYER PROOF
dueled for the lead two wide to the stretch, was overtaken by the winner in mid stretch and was tiring but had enough of a cushion to save second. TACKY
ANNIE was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then did not threaten. MY THREE ASE'S had no speed, trailed while inside to the stretch
and was never a factor. SNOOZY SUZY hustled to contest the pace from the rail to the stretch then tired and the rider dropped his whip a sixteenth out.
TOP HAT MISTRESS chased to the turn, raced four then three wide to the stretch and stopped.

SEIZE THE CHANCE was rank behind rivals and shifted out, got outrun to the turn, raced three wide then shifted widest for the drive and closed with a rush
to get the nod on the wire. SECRETLY PARANOIDE was outsprinted to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch, rallied to get to terms leaving mid stretch,
had a short lead late but was nailed on the line. THANKS set the pace two wide to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then was collared by the runnerup
and outfinished. LYDIA O LYDIA chased the pace from the rail to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch but lacked the needed late response. FLYING
HOME stalked the pace to the turn, came three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. WINNING SOUND flashed speed to the
turn, was outrun two wide to the stretch then gave way. MORNING DOVE had no speed and was not a factor.

FALCONS FURY was on the pace from the outset, got collared by the runnerup on the second turn, battled that one to mid stretch then dug in determinedly
to prevail. BIG WISH was outsprinted to the backstretch, pulled outside rivals to go after the winner, dueled that one two wide to the stretch, stayed on to
mid stretch then got outfinished while never threatened for second. BOBBY'S ALIBI stalked the pace to the half, was outrun while three wide on the second
turn and did not rally. DI LAURIAN was allowed to settle to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch but was never a threat. WHO YOU SAY I AM
pressed the pace early, settled on the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch then gave way. VIBRAINUM trailed throughout.

SILK ROAD SALLY was chasing to the turn, responded when asked for speed, swung four wide into the stretch, rallied determinedly and held driving. BOLD
MISTRESS was outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then finished steadily for the place. WINNING APPEAL dueled outside a rival and
two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then weakened. LADY OF THE HOUSE was slow to find a comfortable stride and trailed, raced two
wide to the stretch then was green behind horses in upper stretch but leveled out late and was showing some interest. SILVER LYRIC contested the pace
inside a rival to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. IN THE VAULT had no speed, was fanned four wide on the turn and did not rally
in the drive. REINA DE REYES was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch but came up empty in the lane. SHANGHAI SUNRISE flashed
speed to the turn, stayed on when pushed out to the four path to the stretch but gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
GIVE ME THE LUTE was half of a blistering pace, raced two wide to the stretch, edged away to mid stretch then held off PLATE SIDE late. PLATE SIDE
was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground then shifted out for room and came on steadily but too late. PAPAPIFAS hustled to attend the pace inside the
winner, got outkicked to mid stretch then finished evenly. SILENT MOVIES had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch and was gaining ground steadily
late. HECK YEAH chased the pace two wide to the stretch then closed with a belated rally. DESCARTES stalked the pace two wide to the stretch but was
outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. MON CAMO got outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch and did not rally. SNOW FEATHER had no
speed and saved ground to no avail. FRUITFULLY trailed throughout.

Footnotes
THORN HILL CAT had good speed, dueled from the rail for six furlongs, edged away under urging to mid stretch and held driving. MOONLIGHT BLUE
stalked the winner to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, was outrun to mid stretch then battled determinedly to save the place.
MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE had no speed and trailed to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch then closed steadily to the line. JASON X L was also
outrun to the half, bid three wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. GIANT MARK hustled inside early but was outsprinted by the winner,
had to steady off that one's heels at the seven eighths, shifted out and was rank to the backstretch, settled while stalking to the second turn, bid three wide
to the stretch but tired in the final furlong. ASKIN' FOR TROUBLE attended the pace outside the winner to the stretch then was outkicked and tired. DIZZY
DANCER was four wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, tried to rally three then four wide to the stretch but came up empty. ZAKAROFF had
no speed and was not a factor.
