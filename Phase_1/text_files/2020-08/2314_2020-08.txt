STAY FANTASTIC away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside in the run down
the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, took control entering the stretch and drew clear in the lane. FORT LANGLEY tracked the
leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, engaged the pacesetters three wide entering the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on the
winner entering the lane, and closed two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. SIR BREGOVIC stalked the early pace while racing five wide
entering the backstretch, angled in to commence his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed with late interest from along the rail in the drive to get
up for the show position. THE CHANCES R broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied four wide
entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response late while finishing two wide in the drive. ALLSTAR BOY away well and dueled for the lead
one out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run to the final turn, but was unable to keep tabs on the winner entering the final
turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

KANDY KATIE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, repelled a bid by BRALORNE from along the inside leaving the turn, and inched clear in the
drive. AIRAFFAIR broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid three wide entering the
final turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place. WANDALITA pressed the leader into the backstretch while racing
one out from the rail, forced the issue from the outside of KANDY KATIE in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and finished evenly two wide
in the drive. BRALORNE brushed the gate at the start, rushed up along the inside to track the leaders entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along
the rail entering the final turn, slipped through to challenge for the lead leaving the turn, but was outfinished late. PAY MY WAY away well and stalked the
leaders into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly two out from the rail in the drive.
DEBATABLE stalked the leaders one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing
response late. The rider of DEBATABLE dropped his whip entering the final turn.

strides with the winner in the drive, but battled gamely to hold the place. BILLS SMOKN BULLET away alertly and tracked the leader one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, collared the leaders three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to just miss the place. EZEKIEL
stalked the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied four wide to challenge for the lead entering the final turn, and finished three
wide in the drive while unable to sustain his bid. TWISTGRIPS was slow into stride and trailed the field into the backstretch while racing one out from the
rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. CRACKDOWN away well and dueled
for the lead one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, but weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
CHEF unhurried early while dropping back to trail, pulled his way into contention in the run to the final turn, rallied smartly four wide through the turn,
assumed command entering the lane and quickly drew clear. K K GOLD stalked the leader from along the rail through the stretch the first time, commenced
his bid and took a narrow advantage entering the final turn, was no match for the winner late, but finished from along the rail in the drive to prove easily
second best. DIXIE'S WILD CARD settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, moved into a striking position
in the run to the final turn, rallied three wide entering the turn, and closed from along the inside in the drive to prove clearly best of the rest. PADDY D'ORO
away alertly and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing two wide through the stretch the first time, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but
lacked the needed closing response when called upon. RED BUFFALO broke sharply and stalked the leader into the stretch the first time, rallied one out
from the rail entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. ATTITUDE INCLUDED away well and raced to the lead from along the rail
entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage through the stretch the first time, maintained that advantage into the backstretch, was collared entering the
final turn, and quickly overtaken, and weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
MISS PROSPECTOR broke sharply and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the stretch the first time, dictated the pace in the run down the
backstretch, widened her advantage entering the final turn, and proved much the best while being kept to task in the lane. WALKINTHEWALK away well
and stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backside, rallied from just
off the rail through the final turn, and finished determinedly from along the inside in the drive to prove second best. PRINCESS OF CAIRO unhurried early
while dropping back to trail, pulled her way into contention in the run down the backstretch, clipped heels and stumbled badly approaching the final turn,
rallied along the inside through the turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to grab the show position. SANGRIA away alertly and was allowed to
settle off the early leader while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed
closing response while finishing four wide in the drive. FLORAL settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the lane the first time,
maintained her position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded over the late stages.

WICKED FORTITUDE tracked the leaders into the first turn while saving ground along the inside, raced in tight quarters the entire length of the backstretch,
tipped off the rail to find racing room entering the final turn, collared the pacesetter entering the lane, and inched clear late. FREE FOR SURE broke sharply
and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside, took a narrow
advantage into the final turn, was collared by the winner entering the lane, and while unable to match strides with that rival late, finished well from along the
rail to prove clearly second best. RACING RIVER tracked the leaders four wide into the backstretch, carried on with a four wide trip in the run down the
backside and into the final turn while maintaining his position, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to prove best of the rest. STAY ALL NIGHT away
well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied from along the inside through the final
turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. THE VALENTINE KID settled off the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied three
wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive. RODE TO GALIANO was bumped at the start, and trailed the field into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but steadied sharply when bumped and turned sideways midway
through the turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive. BABY GRAND pressed the pace three wide entering the backstretch, rallied two out from the
rail entering the final turn, but faded in the late stages. TARGETED away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the backstretch,
pressed the pace two wide in the run to the final turn, before weakening. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of
RODE TO GALIANO lodged a claim of foul against the rider of THE VALENTINE KID for alleged interference midway through the final turn. After review, the
claim of foul was upheld, and THE VALENTINE KID was disqualified from fifth and placed sixth.
