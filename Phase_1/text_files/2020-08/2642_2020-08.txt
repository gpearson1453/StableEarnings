Footnotes
PROFESSIONAL broke readily, was urged along the inside setting the pace on a narrow margin, repelled a rival's challenge racing into upper stretch,
shifted out in the closing stages but held his foes on a safe margin under pressure. OMEN OF CHANGE, in touch prompting the pace in the opening half,
pressed the issue on the far turn to upper stretch, couldn't maintain terms with the winner while racing a bit erratically through the stretch but prevailed for
second. ZOE'S DELIGHT tracked just off the first flight three wide to the backstretch, was urged to bid in that path nearing the lane but couldn't gain terms
with the top pair while just edging a rival for a share. HI HO CHEERIO, caught four wide in early stages, settled out of striking distance, was prompted to
advance four wide into the lane but was just outkicked for a share. TAPSOLUTE, off a step slowly, settled last and failed to menace. HARD TO PARK
tracked off the first flight along the inside to the far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane.

OUT OF PATIENCE reserved near the inside in the opening stages, commenced a steady advance along the rail entering the far turn, shifted outside the
pacesetter to challenge leaving midstretch and prevailed under firm encouragement. KELA BREW tracked just off the leaders along the inside, came
through along the rail to bid for command racing through the far turn, gained a clear lead in upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner. SPIRIT MISSION
raced three wide between foes into the first turn, shifted in entering the backstretch, advanced through close quarters between rivals to close the gap on the
pacesetter nearing the far turn, shifted out three wide while being prompted to challenge nearing upper stretch but finished evenly in the closing stages.
SLICK AS ICE settled last to the backstretch and improved position inside foes racing into the stretch while no real threat. VOW OF FRANCIS, caught four
wide racing into the first turn, couldn't produce a closing bid. LOGAN'S LEOPARD, urged along the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, went
clear into the far turn while shifting off the rail but gave way once headed nearing the lane. MONEY BROKER, urged prompting a rival's pace to the
backstretch, gave way nearing the far turn.

Footnotes
EL TIZAR broke readily, pulled his way clear while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin racing into the far turn and was kept to
firm encouragement to prevail. TWOKO BAY, rated along the inside stalking the pacesetter to the backstretch, shifted to the three path racing into the lane
and continued willingly to close the gap. JACKS OUTLAW was rated just off the second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide on the
far turn into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share. NORTHCUT, reserved outside a rival in the last flight to the backstretch, briefly
awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then split foes just off the inside entering the stretch while being just outkicked for a share. OFF THE MEDS,
reserved near the inside, saved ground on the far turn to upper stretch drawing into contention but lacked the needed late kick. MISTER NOT FUNNY,
forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter to the far turn, emptied out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CLOSE TO ME was rated along the inside tracking just off the second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance along the rail nearing the far turn,
wrested the advantage leaving the midway point of the bend and went clear under pressure. DUSTY PRINCESS settled well back racing to the backstretch,
saved ground on the far turn gathering momentum, swung out four wide entering the lane and prevailed for the place honors. MEMORABLE ANGEL, urged
between foes to force the pace outside a rival into the first turn, went clear into the backstretch, held sway to the far turn, proved no match when challenged
by the winner on the far turn, then drifted wide through late stages. VICTIM, forwardly placed between foes racing just off the first flight to the backstretch,
angled in nearing the lane and continued evenly. CITY GONE COUNTRY, urged to contend racing five wide into the first turn, continued to track just off the
leaders outside foes through the backstretch and gave way into the far turn. MADISON'S QUARTERS, urged inside a rival disputing the pace into the
backstretch, conceded the lead while shifting out midway through the backstretch while continuing in brief pursuit but came up empty on the far turn.
STRIKE PERFECTION, urged between foes into the first turn, gave way early.

AND ISLES, urged along the inside prompting a rival's pace, went clear racing into the turn and held sway on a comfortable advantage under right handed
pressure. SKIPTEASE, held up off the first flight in early stages, made steady progress while angling inwards nearing the lane and proved best of the
others. GIVE EM SHADE broke readily, was urged between foes prompting the pace into the turn and faded into the lane. SPITFIRE SUZIE forwardly
placed, four, then three wide pursuing the leaders into the turn, continued outside foes into the lane but steadily faded. ESTHER settled well back while
angling inside, shifted outside a tiring foe entering the lane and continued evenly. LADY PALOMA broke slowly, then raced wide to the stretch while proving
no threat. GRADED ATTITUDE flashed brief pace three wide between foes, shifted in entering the turn and gave way. MINI WHINNY was off slowly and
dropped out early.

BIG BUFFY, urged inside a rival disputing the pace, was headed racing into the turn but continued to dispute the issue into the lane to regain the advantage,
kicked away through the stretch and just lasted under firm handling. DRIED PEPPER tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted out
three wide in the lane and was making steady progress late. DIABLO CUERNO tracked off the first flight while angling to the inside, saved ground to upper
stretch and continued with interest along the rail to close the gap. MEMOLOTSAMISCHIEF, urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the bend,
gained a brief lead midway through the turn but faltered in the drive. BREXTON settled off the second flight in early stages, angled inside on the turn but
proved no threat. ULTIMATE KNIGHT broke awkwardly, switched out racing into the turn but never gained contention. AND ISLES WAS FRACTIOUS,
THEN MOMENTARILY CAST IN THE GATE BEFORE THE START, NECESSITATING A LATE SCRATCH.

Footnotes
STITZY was rated between foes as part of the second flight tracking the leaders from well out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, angled inside
after a half, steadily gathered momentum racing into the far turn, advanced in tandem with a rival to bid for command between rivals nearing upper stretch
and drove clear. WARRIOR BOSS angled to the inside early tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, saved ground into the far turn, shifted out to
bid between foes just inside the leader in late stages but came up second best. SWEEPING EDGE settled outside foes to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance while angling five wide into the lane and came through close quarters to narrowly prevail for a share on the wire. GOPHER GOLD, held up
between foes in early stages, angled to the inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes racing into the far turn, was fanned six wide into the lane
and was making steady progress late. TRI SPOT settled along the inside in the opening half, saved ground on the far turn gaining position inside foes but
lacked the needed late kick. WESTONS WILDCAT, off slowly, was urged to a forward placing racing just off the leaders to the backstretch, was urged to
lodge a three wide bid nearing upper stretch but couldn't sustain that momentum. YEAH YEAH, a bit slow into stride, settled outside foes racing off the
second flight, angled four wide nearing the lane gaining some position but had no final bid while racing in close quarters late. MINNESOTA LUCKY, urged
forcing the pace outside a rival into the first turn, went clear into the backstretch, set the pace into the far turn and gave out once headed racing into upper
stretch. BLAME BISHOP was hustled inside a rival pressing the pace into the first turn, lost ground to that rival entering the backstretch and gave way early.

Footnotes
SANDY SANGRIA broke readily, vied for command three wide between foes racing through the backstretch, angled inwards while moving to gain a clear
advantage nearing the bend, extended the margin racing into the lane and held sway under left handed pressure. DELIA O'HARA joined the pace four wide
in early stages, shifted inwards racing into the turn continuing in pursuit of the winner between foes and prevailed for the place honors. SMART N WICKED,
forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, was eased out of close quarters conceding some position nearing the turn, shifted out four wide
nearing upper stretch and continued with late interest to prevail for a share. MIDNIGHT EMMA broke outwards bumping ARI GIA, was settled off the first
flight racing to the turn, shifted three wide nearing the lane and continued evenly between foes. BRECHIN'S COMMAND, forwardly placed along the inside
tracking just off the pacesetter, saved ground to upper stretch and faded in late stages. ARI GIA, bumped, then shuffled back at the start, never menaced
thereafter.

Footnotes
CAUSIN MISCHIEF, held up off the first flight after the opening furlong, continued unhurried into the turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and
produced a solid late response to gain even terms with LUCKY LITTLE LADY on the wire. The latter came through tight quarters in early stages to duel for
command three wide between foes, lost ground to the pacesetter entering the bend, angled inwards while continuing in pursuit of that foe racing into the
stretch, took over late and just held her rival on even terms at the wire. INTHEMISTYMOONLITE, urged four wide forcing the pace through the backstretch,
went clear into the turn, held sway to upper strech while angling to the rail and faltered leaving midstretch. BLUE LIZZY, urged between rivals disputing the
pace while exchanging some contact with LUCKY LITTLE LADY midway through the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the leader while angling inwards
into the lane and gave way late. UNDECIDEDCERTAINTY settled last along the inside early, angled out on the turn but made no impact. HEAVENLY ARCH
angled to the inside while being urged in brief pursuit of the leaders but gave way nearing the lane.
