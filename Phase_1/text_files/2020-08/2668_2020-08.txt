Footnotes
ALGODONAL , three deep around the turn, remained in the three path in the stretch, closed inside horses and was up late. HONORABLE LILLY , a forward
factor slightly off the rail on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, made the lead while drifting to the eight path near the eighth pole and missed. JUDI BLUE
EYES circled the turn three wide, advanced outside horses in upper stretch, was fanned nine deep near the eighth pole and hung. MISSIMARD hugged the
inner rail much of the race and showed a mild gain. NIGHTMARE failed to rally in an even effort. DON'T BLAME BERTIE lacked speed and failed to be a
factor. ALWAYS TALKING set the pace along the rail and gave way the final furlong. PARCHED GHOST was no factor. LIVELY KITTEN , checked in close
quarters soon after the break, was taken to the seven path in upper stretch and showed some interest late. MORE OR LESS chased the pace, faltered and
was eased.

Footnotes
PHANTOM RO broke on top despite stumbling, quickly cleared and dropped in to set the pace under some rating, was joined from his outside near the five
eighths, edged back clear after a half mile, responded to strong handling past the three sixteenths and held firm. V. I. P. CODE edged up outside rivals
nearing the five furlong marker and prompted the winner, was put to a strong ride mid turn, continued pursuit past the furlong grounds and stayed on well.
CAUSE HE'S WESTERN , taken to rate early on, came under a ride three wide past mid turn, raced four wide in upper stretch and offered a slight kick. NO
MORE TALK saved ground chasing the leaders, shifted out in upper stretch, failed to kick on past the eighth pole and faded. EASY RIVER , between
runners early, raced two to three wide into the lane but failed to respond.

HURRICANE PARTY , clear early, set an easy pace along the rail, was put to urging in the drive and remained well clear of the others. RELIABILITY , four
wide the first turn, raced between horses leaving the backstretch, angled to the five path turning for home, rallied outside horses and lugged in a bit late. MY
BOY PADDY , five wide the first turn, advanced four deep on the far turn and finished gamely between horses. BOLD QUEST saved ground and lacked the
needed late effort. MAKOTO stalked the pace, was well positioned outside the winner on the far turn and gave way the final furlong. JESTFUL chased the
pace three wide and weakened. PATRIOT GAME was outrun. CARSON AND I raced inside horses down the backstretch and lacked a rally. FIRST LAW
was outrun. LOCK , taken up entering the first turn, circled the far turn four deep and weakened.

Footnotes
ANNIKA GOLD bore out at the break, recovered and settled off the inside, dropped in and made a solid run towards the rail with three furlongs remaining,
angled out three wide into the lane, forged clear under a drive past the three sixteenths, increased her lead while fully extended past mid stretch then held
sway. RIDGEMONT HIGH lagged well back, was under a drive while off the past the five sixteenths, came five wide into the lane, straightened away and
closed steadily to be second best. STIVA rated off the loose leader, edged closer into the far turn, bid two wide to be on even terms after six furlongs, briefly
shook clear, could not resist the winner in upper stretch then faded in the final seventy yards. SI MAMACITA rated inside early on, eased out and gave
chase leaving the far turn but lacked any serious resopnse. WILKO LOVESONG saved ground while outrun. HASHTAG SELFIE , keyed up early on,
opened up on the field and set the pace towards the rail, was reeled in past the three eighths, fought on to about the quarter pole then faltered.

LINE DANCING stalked the pace racing slightly off the rail, eased out for the drive, advanced between horses in upper stretch, closed outside MOMENTITA
in the drive and was up approaching the wire. MOMENTITA chased the pace outside LOOKIN BACK, overtook that one turning for home, opened a clear
lead in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. MY GIRL BLUE , three wide the first turn, raced three wide between horses on the far turn and finished
willingly. LADY BLAKENEY lacked speed, swung to the far outside in mid stretch and passed tired foes. BELLA BETTINA , checked when pinched back
leaving the starting gate, advanced nicely five deep leaving the far turn then failed to sustain her move. HEY BABE raced inside horses most of the trip and
lacked a rally. SUPERHELPFUL , four wide the first turn, advanced four wide leaving the far turn then weakened in the drive. LOOKIN BACK set the pace
along the rail and gave way approaching the eighth pole. CHARRAIG DHUBH bore in leaving the starting gate, raced in mid pace early and dropped back
leaving the far turn. MICK'SBESTBETYET trailed.

BETHABARA settled outside rivals, steadily advanced three wide past the five sixteenths, closed in under strong handling and took command heading to
the eighth pole, shook clear of MY CANDY GIRL nearing the sixteenth marker and held firm. MY CANDY GIRL took command between rivals early then
spurted away around the first turn, set a solid pace towards the rail, dug in when confronted past the three sixteenths, made the winner work to go clear then
stayed gamely to the line. GENNIE HIGHWAY taken to rate towards the inside, angled out around a tiring foe leaving the far turn, dropped back in a bit mid
way on the turn, came out and churned on with interest. SHEZALEMONDROPKID , in range and outside a foe early on, edged up to chase between horses
leaving the three eighths then lacked a serious stretch response. DANCING CONTESSA , taken back and settled well off the pace while about three wide,
angled out leaving the far turn, circled five wide and had a mild rally. MAYAN QUEEN saved ground under rating, edged up nearing the far turn, was
shuffled back behind a tiring foe, altered out in upper stretch and kept on with some interest. ROZIERE , off the pace towards the inside, steadied when in a
bit close past the five sixteenths, angled out and kept trying. LOA was steadied nearing the first turn, raced three wide leaving the far turn, angled out and
came up empty. MELISANDE settled off the rail, made a four wide run from the five eighths to about the three eighths, chased and gave way. WEEKEND
DELIGHT , between rivals into the far turn, weakened. LINEA VERDE chased outside a foe, was under pressure leaving the far turn and faltered.
YOUGOTTABEKITTEN saved ground stalking the early pace, faltered leaving the far turn, was pulled up in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
ROYAL THUNDER stalked the pace in hand down the backstretch, was two wide on the turn while leader opened up, responded readily to urging in mid
stretch, closed outside, led late and drove clear. THE CAIRO KID sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, opened up on the turn and gave way
grudgingly. STASH MY MONEY , well off the rail on the turn, was under urging near the three eighths pole, lacked a serious response and offered a mild,
late gain. MAYBE SOMEDAY , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, tired. BARRISTER , three wide on the turn, was outrun. SURVEY (IRE) raced
in the two path on the turn and failed to rally. MORE TWIRL hugged the inner rail, faltered turning for home and was eased late.

Footnotes
CANNON'S ROAR , tucked in just behind the leaders, angled three wide approaching the quarter pole, responded to one right handed ask, moved to
engage DUNDALK soon past the eighth pole, took command about a sixteenth out and held firm under steady hand encouragement. DUNDALK prompted
the pace outside CAN HE SHINE, moved in hand to threaten nearing the three eighths, dueled under rating past the five sixteenths, shook clear under
pressure near mid stretch, dug in when confronted and held well to the wire. CAN HE SHINE grabbed command early and set the pace towards the inside,
was joined from his outside and dueled as the pace quickened past the three eighths, kept up the battle to about mid stretch then faded late. SEVILLE
BARBER stalked the pace three wide, edged up and was put to pressure leaving the far turn, chased into the lane and came up empty. SEVILLE ROW
saved ground under rating, was in a bit close near the three eighths, eased out in the drive but lacked the needed kick. BROKER'S REWARD , under firm
rating early on, pulled his way forward while between rivals past the five eighths, steadied in tight quarters near the three eighths, regrouped and churned
on. ELEMENTARY settled off pace, saved ground leaving the far turn but failed to rally. START WITH YES , four wide around the first turn, continued well
wide stalking to the five eighths then dropped back. THE QUANTICO KID , rank in the early going, saved some ground and faded around the final turn.
STONE COURAGEOUS lost ground four wide and dropped back.

sixteenth pole and narrowly prevailed. AMPLIO ESQUEMA , between horses entering the far turn, swung to the five path leaving the turn and rallied nicely
outside foes. PERFECT KIND , three wide the first turn, chased the pace outside the leader, raced three wide the far turn, gained a short lead near the
eighth pole and weakened late. PEARLYVILLE , four wide both turns, flattened out. ESTHER'S FORTUNE stalked the pace racing inside horses, eased out
for the drive and failed to rally. ORBETTE set the pace along the rail and weakened the final furlong. PLAY CHARADES chased the pace two wide and
weakened. RIDGELYSREDHOT raced near the rail and was not a factor. MY SUPER SALLY was no factor. TEMPLE GARDEN was outrun.
