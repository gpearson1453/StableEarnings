Footnotes
STEVIE'S SONG pressed the leaders four wide into the first turn, continued to force the issue three out from the rail in the run down the backstretch,
assumed a narrow advantage entering the final turn, and drifted four wide in deep stretch under left handed urging while bumping with AMORCITO late to
prevail. AMORCITO stalked the compact field while trailing into the backstretch, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed four out from
the rail in the drive while being carried out and bumped in the late stages to just miss. MOUSEY MOUSEY broke sharply and vied for the lead from along
the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, and
battled gamely from along the rail in the stretch drive. G M T BABY away alertly and dueled for the lead two wide from between rivals entering the first turn,
continued to battle one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but faded in the late stages. NOTICE away well and pressed
the pace three wide entering the first turn, forced the issue two out from the rail in the run to the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. Following the
running of this race there was both a stewards inquiry as well as a trainers claim of foul. The trainer of AMORCITO lodged a claim of foul against the rider of
STEVIE'S SONG for alleged interference in the lane. After review the stewards upheld the claim of foul, and disqualified STEVIE'S SONG from first and
placed her second.

Footnotes
ATLIN BAY away well and raced to the lead entering the turn and getting to the rail, held a clear advantage into the lane and was never threatened late.
SIMPLY SMOKIN chased the leader through the turn while saving ground at the rail, and finished willingly in the drive to finish on even terms with
BACKFIRE BABY. BAKFIRE BABY chased the leader two wide into the turn, and finished three wide in the drive to finish on even terms with SIMPLY
SMOKIN. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS broke sharply and chased the leaders three wide into the turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive. FOOT
SOLDIER away alertly, and chased two wide from between rivals through the turn, and finished from along the rail in the stretch drive. RICHARDS
COMMAND was slow into stride and chased the pack into the turn while racing two out from the rail, and finished three wide in the drive while showing late
interest. CATCH THE GAL was devoid of early speed and trailed the filed into the turn while saving ground at the rail, saved ground throughout, but was
unable to make a late impact while finishing along the inside.

BOUNDARY BAY away alertly and pressed the pace two wide in the run down the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide through the final turn,
assumed command entering the lane, and held off a late charge by SLEW'S DA BOSS to prevail. SLEW'S DA BOSS settled off the contested early pace
while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail in
the drive to prove clearly second best. EUROPEAN away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide
entering the final turn and finished three wide in the drive. KHAIKY'S COMMAND stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the stretch drive. METAL MAGIC broke sharply and raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with
BOUNDARY BAY entering the lane, and faded late. CAPTAIN JONES settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch,
rallied three out from the rail entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon.

HERE'S HANNAH broke sharply and tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final
turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to be up in time. WARRIOR'S PROMISE settled off the early pace while saving ground at the
rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, tipped off the rail entering the lane, and closed
determinedly one out from the rail from between rivals late to just miss. NORTHERN GRAYSTAR rushed up from along the rail to vie for the early lead in
the run to the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, eased off the leader approaching the final turn, and shifted two wide to launch
her bid, re-took a narrow advantage soon after entering the lane, and just failed to last in a great effort. BUTTERSCOTCH BLEND stalked the leaders into
the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the stretch drive. UNDER PAR
away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide into the backstretch, assumed command and
opened a clear advantage entering the final turn, was overtaken soon after entering he lane, and faded in the drive. AMAZONIAN broke through the gate
prior to the start, was away well but taken in hand and allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied
two wide into the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon.

RAISE A DANCER away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, and repelled the bid from SWEET SIXTEEN to prevail. SWEET SIXTEEN away alertly and tracked the leader into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and battled two wide for the lead through the stretch to just miss. OUR
BONITA ROSE settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the first turn, commenced her bid two wide from between rivals
approaching the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive. BAD AND BOUGIE tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the
rail, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn while awaiting room, tipped three wide soon after entering the lane, and closed determinedly.
HARLAN'S ANGEL stalked the leaders into the first turn while racing a bit head strong, rallied four wide through the final turn while in a striking position, but
failed to sustain her bid in the late going. SHARP CONTRAST broke sharply and tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing two out
from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked a closing response while finishing two out from the rail in the drive. KODIAK KWIK settled
off the early pace while racing just out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid. QUEEN
OF BARN I unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, was always well back and failed to make a late impact.

while racing two wide entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, tipped four wide entering the stretch, and closed determinedly to just
miss the place. SPOKANE'S GEM tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, but
needed more late while finishing one out from the rail in the drive. RED RAPTOR away well and pressed the leader into the backstretch while racing one out
from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was outfinished late. SANTA CAUSE away alertly and tracked the leaders from along the rail in the

Footnotes
ANIMA away alertly and pressed the pace from the outside of SPROG entering the first turn, continued to force the issue with that rival in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, got the better of that foe late, and held off a late surge by BLONDIE to prevail. BLONDIE settled off the early pace
while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside through the final turn, tipped three wide in mid stretch and closed with a rush to gain the
place. SPROG broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and
through the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive and gave way grudgingly. HEFTY RANSOM tracked the dueling leaders from
along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished willingly four wide in the drive. MAKIN IT UP away well
and stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied two wide through the final turn. and closed one out from
the rail in the drive in an even effort. QUEEN'S PARK settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail
entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. SUNRONITA stalked the leaders three wide
entering the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. FANCY FRAULEIN tracked the leaders
into the first turn while racing two out from the rail, maintained a tracking trip two wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but faded in the
stretch drive.
