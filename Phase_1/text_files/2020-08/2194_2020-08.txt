Footnotes
FABLES LOVE AFFAIR tracked the leaders along the rail as part of the second flight in the opening stages, came under some prompting to advance
entering the turn, shifted to the four path entering upper stretch, then took over in that path in the closing stages to prevail under firm left handed
encouragement. MUCHO SUPER GIRL broke sharply to gain the advantage while angling inwards, conceded the lead after the opening sixteenth to track a
rival's pace to the bend, continued with a steady bid to regain command between calls late but couldn't fend off the winner. VEGAN GOES BEST, urged
along the inside to gain the advantage after the opening sixteenth, kicked clear racing into the turn while shifting off the rail, held sway to upper stretch but
faltered in the drive. DEVIL LADY tracked the leaders four wide as part of the second flight racing through the backstretch and continued evenly in that path
into the lane. DISTINCT FLIRT tracked the leaders three wide between foes early, angled in racing into the lane but lacked a rally. JUST SPLENDID tracked
the leaders between foes in early stages and faded along the inside nearing the lane.

FASHION ROSE broke readily, angled to the inside stalking just off the first flight racing to the turn, shifted out three deep nearing upper stretch to bid for
command entering the lane and prevailed in late stages under firm hand urging. FIFTYSHADESOGRAYCE, urged along the inside disputing the pace,
dueled for command to late stages but couldn't contain the winner while narrowly besting a rival for the place honors. RAGING GOLD DIGGER tracked off
the first flight from out of striking distance outside foes racing to the turn, shifted out slightly entering the lane, then made a belated bid four deep nearing the
wire. EXTRA GORGEOUS tracked the leaders inside rivals early, saved ground to the lane but lacked the needed final kick. then was vanned off the course
following the race. DIM SUM hopped at the start, settled between foes and failed to produce a serious challenge. SULLYVIN'S G G, urged to terms forcing a
rival's pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper stretch.

bid to wrest the advantage racing into upper stretch and held sway to the end under pressure. COCO LOCO MAMA tracked the leaders between foes while
shifting three deep racing into the turn and continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others. HEIGHTEN, off slowly, was settled last to the turn,
angled inside nearing the lane and improved position in late stages. ALOTTA SOUL tracked the leaders three, then four wide between foes into the turn but
had no closing bid. PEARLE DE VEENE, prompted to a forward placing nearest the rail in the opening stages, was steadied momentarily avoiding tight
quarters after the opening sixteenth, was prompted to regain contention while shifting out nearing upper stretch but proved empty in the drive. BUTTERCUP
UP tracked the leaders four, then five wide into the turn and steadily faded. XYLINA'S ART, came through close quarters between rivals to dispute the pace
inside the eventual winner while moving to gain the advantage racing into the turn, held sway through the bend and gave out abruptly once headed by the
winner. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF PEARLE DE VEENE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE IN THE RUN THROUGH THE BACKSTRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
FIRE EXTINGUISHER, urged along outside foes in pursuit of the pacesetter racing to the turn, made steady progress three wide on the bend to loom
outside the leader nearing midstretch and continued with a steady bid to wrest a narrow advantage in time under firm encouragement. WESTA WAVERLY
broke sharply, went well clear racing into the turn, held sway to upper stretch, then resisted the winner's challenge to late stages but proved only second
best. PRINCE RAMA tracked the leaders three deep between foes off the second flight, angled inwards racing into the lane and improved position between
foes to the end. RUNAWAY READY, held up out of close quarters just after the start, continued unhurried into the turn, angled out four wide racing through
the lane and made some belated progress nearing the wire while just missing for a share. ROVERTON tracked off the second flight racing four wide into the
turn, shifted inwards in late stages and lacked the needed final kick. ROYALLY DECORATED tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to
the lane but offered no rally. GUN WAR, urged along pursuing the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight into the turn, gave way into the lane. C
D THUNDER flashed brief pace between foes pursuing the pacesetter in second flight, bore out midway through the turn and abruptly emptied out. VIVO
broke slowly and failed to menace. GOVERNOR GOOFY, caught wide early, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF BLUE was rated inside rivals tracking just off the first flight racing to the far turn, switched out in upper stretch to challenge three deep
racing past the furlong marker and went well clear under firm encouragement. LIL' RED DEVIL was settled last racing to the far turn, swung out five wide
entering the lane and produced a steady late response to just prevail for the place honors on the wire. ALL NATIVE, urged to dictate the pace on a narrow
margin along the rail in the opening stages, dueled for command inside a rival racing into the far turn, dispatched that foe entering the lane but yielded once
headed by the winner midstretch. STEAL THE THUNDER was rated between rivals as part of the second flight racing to the far turn, lost some position
when shuffled out of close quarters racing past the quarter mile marker, then shifted three deep in the lane and came through close quarters to regain some
position between rivals late. LADY LANGFUHR, reserved off the second flight along the inside, saved ground through the far turn to gain striking distance
inside foes entering the lane but had no final kick. SHOT OF WINE, reserved off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, angled out four wide
racing into upper stretch but lost some momentum when racing in tight quarters between foes late. CHINA DISH, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace,
pressed the issue through the far turn to upper stretch, then drifted out in the closing stages while quickly emptying out. BIRDS VIEW tracked just off the first
flight three deep in the opening half, was prompted to lodge a brief bid in that path nearing the lane but soon emptied out.

SHAY'S GLORY broke readily, gained a forward placing attending a rival's pace under light rating, moved to press the issue nearing upper stretch, then
wrested the advantage and went clear late under pressure. ARRESTING, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far
turn, resisted the winner's bid racing into upper stretch but proved only second best. GOING RUNNING TOO, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just
off the leader racing to the backstretch, offered no closing bid while continuing well enough for a share. CHARMING FURY tracked off the second flight
between foes, angled inside after a half but lacked a rally. PEYTONS SKY DANCER was settled into stride racing off the inside but passed only tiring rivals.
POPPIN TOPS broke slowly and proved no threat. AMANDA STORY, carried a bit wide into the first turn, tracked off the second flight three wide into the
backstretch and emptied out nearing the second bend. MY AWARD proved no factor. FOXYS IRISH AFFAIR drifted out racing into the first turn and soon
dropped out.

Footnotes
GINGER ROSE was rated off the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling to the second bend, angled out four wide nearing
upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to wrest command and go clear under firm left handed pressure. AFTER RED SUN settled along
the inside racing to the backstretch, angled out five wide entering the lane and continued with a steady effort to edge a rival for the place honors late. SOME
SAY SO, forwardly placed three wide racing to the backstretch, moved to gain a clear advantage racing into the far turn, held sway into the lane but faltered
late. DEPUTY DORA, shuffled back out of close quarters at the start, settled last to the backstretch, switched out racing into the lane and split foes to gain
position late. SMOKIN HOT MOMMA was rated off just off the first flight to the backstretch, steadily advanced on the far turn to lodge a brief bid three deep
nearing upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum. MIZZEN AIR, forwardly placed along the inside stalking the pace, switched out to make brief
pursuit of the leader between foes into the far turn but gave way into the lane. FRANCES ANNA, urged to the lead between foes racing to the backstretch,
gave way racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
POKEGAMA broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the turn, then steadily widened the margin into the lane while
being kept to steady pressure. LAURA N LUKAS, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter, couldn't match terms with that foe but held well for the
place honors. JAKEALINA tracked off the second flight along the inside, shifted out four wide entering the lane and continued to gain position.
ANGIEMEANSBUSINESS angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, shifted three wide on the bend while being urged to advance but proved
empty in the drive. GRADED ATTITUDE tracked off the second flight while angling inwards and faded into the stretch. RABBIT TWENTY TWO tracked off
the second flight three wide between foes, steadied momentarily avoiding a stricken rival racing into the turn and lacked a rally. QUEEN ISABELLA settled
between foes early and proved no threat. AUNT ETHEL proved no factor. AUDREY'S ATTITUDE was settled into stride dropping well off the pace, shifted
out while being prompted to advance nearing the turn, suffered an injury racing past the three furlong marker and was vanned off the course.
