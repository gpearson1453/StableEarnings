Footnotes
STRATUS BIRD sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, increased her margin into the stretch and was ridden out to be kept to task.
ROSIES BABY chased the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. BELL OF RAINIER lagged early,
raced three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. GOLDIE'S DARLINS raced four-wide through both turns, lacked early speed and failed to
menace. SWISS SKIMMER was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the second turn and weakened. ST. SOMEWHERE settled off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened after going a half.

FIREBALL RED was away in good order to duel for the lead with SA LUTE MR. H while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by FRENCH
COAST into the lane and held that rival at bay to the wire. FRENCH COAST was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn,
offered a bid nearing the three-sixteenths pole but could not get by the winner in the drive. GOBOLDLY chased the leaders while racing four-wide
throughout and failed to gain in the drive. MOKI DUGWAY lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. STARZAN was forwardly
placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. SA LUTE MR. H was bumped at the break, disputed the pace from the inside for a half and
weakened.

DYF lacked early speed, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin into the lane and held off ZIPPIN WINE
to prevail. ZIPPIN WINE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole, could not get by the winner but
finished with a steady bid. BENNY THE JET sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, angled out into the stretch, stayed on
well in the drive and finished with good courage. JOHNNY FIVE raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished
evenly. LOOK AT MY STAR was off a step slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. SLEET AFLEET chased the
leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going five furlongs. ALL POWERED UP raced four-wide through both turns, settled off the leaders and
gradually weakened.

Footnotes
COASTAL TULIPS broke sharply to duel for the lead from off the rail with DAZZLEATION, disposed of that rival after going three furlongs, opened a clear
lead into the stretch and drew off with complete authority. ABRAA JABRAA chased the leaders from the inside throughout, could not match strides with the
winner in the drive but held on well to save the place. SOMETHIN'BOUT IRIS was reserved just off the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide
through the turn and finished with good energy. FORTUNE IN SILK settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. SO
FIGURE IT OUT was taken far back early and finished with some late run. GRAZEN VALOR lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not
a factor. DAZZLEATION was away in good order to dispute the early pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.

Footnotes
CAMDEN HIGH was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing from off the rail, opened a clear margin into the and drew off with complete
authority. UNLIMITEDDATAPLAN pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, could not match strides with that foe in the drive but finished well
to hold the place. MS LYNN settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the stretch and again nearing the sixteenth pole
and finished with good energy. TRIBAL BID was off slow, raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the
quarter and finished evenly. MISS VALOR was forwardly placed, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. CRIBBS tracked the
leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. EMERALD SEA lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. HERE
COMES HOLLEY showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FATS DOMINUS sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through
the lane with complete authority. WORKING was reserved just off the leaders from the inside throughout, reached a striking position into the stretch, was no
match for the winner but clearly second best. GRAN FIESTA was off a step slow ands bumped, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the
second turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. ONE TUFF MINISTER lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the second turn, angled
in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly late. BANZE NO OESTE (BRZ) was bumped at the start, lacked early speed, raced four-wide
through both turns, reached a contending position nearing the stretch but failed to sustain his rally. STAY IN POWER showed no early speed, raced
four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and failed to menace. DEPUTY'S COMMAND was void of early foot, raced five-wide
through the second turn and was not a factor. DUSTIN'S PASSION raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and gradually
weakened. TEMPLE VIEW was away alertly to show brief speed and weakened. MY FOOLISH BEAU chased the leaders while racing four-wide for a half
and weakened.
