FRAZZLED angled in and tucked inside on the first turn, steadied along the rail at the quarter pole, stayed inside to the stretch, tipped out and challenged
BASILIA from the outside and edged clear. BASILIA took control early, controlled the pace and showed the way inside to the stretch, put to left-handed
urging at the eight pole but yielded to the winner. SWEETEST ANGEL off a bit slow to begin, chased inside then a bit off the rail, angled out leaving the turn
and came four wide into the stretch taking aim at the top pair but flattened in the late stages. CHICKS DIG MUNNY stalked BASILIA from a bit off the rail,
chased three wide entering the stretch and weakened. EMBODIED off a bit slow leaving the gate, trailed the field from the inside to the stretch and never
threatened. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
QAHIRA sped to the front, set the pace with company to the outside, cleared rival nearing the quarter pole, urged once right-handed in upper stretch, drew
away and was kept to task under a drive in the final sixteenth. PROUD EMMA stalked inside to the turn, saved ground around the bend, switched off the rail
in upper stretch, could not make an impact on the winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. SANENUS (CHI) bobbled leaving the gate, steered
well off the inside, went outside a trio of rivals at the quarter pole, took aim four wide into the lane but flattened in the stretch. FIRST STAR away quickly
from the outside the settled outside the top pair, tracked outside a rival then three deep into the stretch and weakened. MORNING CYNN pressed the pace
early, lost contact around the turn and chased between foes entering the lane, then faded through the drive.

the final kick needed to get by. PAID INFORMANT traveled off the rail, raced three to four wide into the lane and was along for the show. MOHEMIAN
RHAPSODY off a bit slow to begin, moved to the inside, went two to three wide into the lane, steered out in the stretch but proved no menace. GOLDEN

Footnotes
HORSE GREEDY well placed just off the speed, raced off the rail into the turn, bid three deep or four wide into the stretch, took over in upper stretch, drew
clear and was kept to task. I'M BUSY bumped with POSTERIZE at the start, pressed early then stalked POSTERIZE off the inside, bid between foes in the
lane but got outkicked by the winner. PURE COMEDY chased along the inside into the turn, moved off the rail and came three to four wide into the lane,
steered out further in the stretch and earned the show. POSTERIZE bumped with I'M BUSY leaving the gate, shook that off quickly and took control early
then moved clear, met bids from the two path exiting the bend then gave way in the final furlong. PLUM DANDY lacked early speed, angled four to five wide
around the turn, came out further in the stretch and never threatened. HARVEST A STORM chased wide into the turn, dropped back around the bend and
had nothing left for the late stages.

Footnotes
BRIX stalked outside a rival, angled three wide into the stretch, steered out further in the lane, rallied from the outside and edged FACTORIAL in the final
jump. FACTORIAL set the pace with MANTARAY ISLAND alongside, dueled with that rival into and around the turn and into the lane, battled through the
drive, led late and got nailed by the winner. SEVERIN off a bit slow then steadied early, raced two wide into the turn then angled in, came off the rail a bit
leaving the turn, rallied along the inside late and earned the show. MANTARAY ISLAND pressed the pace then dueled with FACTORIAL, battled down the
lane while drifting out under left-handed urging and got outfinished. ROSSMAN off slow to begin, traveled two wide around the turn, angled out in the stretch
and produced a mild late bid. ESKIMO ROSES broke in and bumped rival at the start, hustled early and stalked the top pair, went two wide around the turn,
angled out in the stretch and lacked a serious bid. SHOW BUSINESS saved ground into the lane, moved off the rail in the drive and showed a mild
response in the final furlong. BIG CHEDDAR bumped leaving the gate, raced off the rail then three deep around the turn, came four wide into the stretch
and was never a factor. SUMMER FIRE chased inside and weakened. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
NICE ICE stumbled badly leaving the gate, well placed behind the lone leader a bit off the rail, bid outside approaching the quarter pole, cleared into the
lane and drew away under some right-handed urging and strong handling. HARPER'S GALLOP stalked outside a rival, traveled two to three wide on the far
turn, put to a drive in upper stretch and bested the rest. DONUT GIRL off a bit slow to begin, settled a bit off the inside, moved three wide then traveled
three deep, finished evenly in the drive and held the show. HOT ON THE TRAIL tracked two wide early, between rivals near the half-mile marker, chased
two wide into the lane, lacked the needed late response and was edged for the show. WARRIOR'S MOON off a bit slow to begin then settled outside a rival,
raced off the inside, came three wide into the stretch, moved out a further in the lane and finished with a mild late rally. D'S LOVELY SOPHIA pulled early
from the inside, went two wide into the stretch, lacked room upper stretch and failed to regain momentum. MAGNIFICENT Q T stalked the pace from the
inside, saved ground into the lane, lacked room upper to mid stretch, angled out and could not regain momentum. NOCHERYLIKEMYCHERY settled near
the inside, angled three wide into the stretch and never threatened. CHARMINGSLEW sped clear to take command, led for six furlongs and folded in the
stretch. DROP THE MIC unhurried in the beginning, traveled near the inside, angled out then back in on the far turn and was never a factor. HAND TIMED.

MAXIM RATE well placed just off the speed from the inside, saved ground into the lane, rallied alongside the leader, floated out by that rival and bumped
late but dug in late to prevail. QUICK (GB) took control early and moved to the inside, pressured from the outside up the backstretch, moved clear at the
quarter pole, met the bid from MAXIM RATE in the drive, lugged out and bumped that rival late and got edged in the final strides. OVER THINKING stalked
outside a rival, asked around the far turn while three wide, drifted out in the lane, rallied and missed the place. CATCH THE EYE unhurried in the opening
stages and angled in, saved ground along the inside and finished well to gain a minor award. MEAL TICKET tracked the pace from the inside then a bit off
the rail, swung three to four wide into the lane, came out further in the stretch and kept on willingly to the line. SIBERIAN IRIS (IRE) unhurried in the
beginning, settled outside a rival, raced two wide, lacked room in the lane and angled out, drifted back to the inside and improved position. PRETTY POINT
angled to the rail on the first turn, came out on the final turn and entered the stretch five wide but lacked a rally. IMPERIAL CREED traveled near the back of
the field, tracked in the two path into the lane, tipped out and never threatened. DON'T BLAME JUDY was mid-pack while two wide, moved out into the
three path, floated out by rival entering the lane and weakened. MS PEINTOUR had early speed then let QUICK take control, stalked that rival from off the
rail then moved up to press from the outside, lost contact leaving the final turn and faded. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
BEDROCK settled early off the inside, angled in nearing the turn, awaited room behind rivals around the turn, angled out into the stretch, rallied to the front
at the eighth pole, kicked clear and won going away. POISE TO STRIKE away quickly showing early speed from the outside, overtaken by the top pair and
chased four wide around the turn, kept on willingly through the drive and got up for second. ENDLESS TALE broke out, chased POISE TO STRIKE then
went between rivals to challenge for command, dueled outside U. S. DANGER into and around the turn, battled to the eighth pole then got overtaken by the
winner and was nailed for second. U. S. DANGER bumped shortly after the start, chased from the inside then went up to duel for the lead, fought back
inside to the eighth pole and weakened in the final furlong. BETITO false broke and broke through the gate just before the rest of the field, traveled off the
rail and three deep early, went five wide into the lane and weakened. FLOYD MONEYMAKER broke out then shifted back in and bumped rival, steadied
briefly along the inside entering the turn, moved off the rail and came three wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. MY BOY ANDY showed no early speed
took the turn two wide and proved no menace. NICKEL CURVE tracked off the rail, entered the stretch three to four wide and tired. THE STEWARDS
REVIEWED THE START OF BETITO AND RULED THAT HE BROKE THROUGH THE STARTING GATE JUST PRIOR TO THE REST OF THE FIELD
AND IS DECLARED A NON-STARTER.
