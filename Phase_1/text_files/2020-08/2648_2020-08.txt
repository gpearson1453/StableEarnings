the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to get up for the place. FOXY BRUNETTE stalked the leader into
the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished willingly fro along the rail to just miss the place.
DANCIN SHOES broke sharply and stalked the leader into the backside while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and
finished willingly four wide in the drive. IRISH LUNA away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, was shuffled
back approaching the final turn, rallied along the inside through the turn, and finished evenly from juts off the rail in the stretch drive. TUI trailed the field into

after entering the lane, and finished from along the rail to garner a share. PERFECT COMMAND stalked the leaders while saving ground at the rail in the

Footnotes
SIDESHOW improved his position through the first turn to race into a stalking trip one out from the rail approaching the second turn, rallied smartly two wide
entering the final turn, assumed command soon after entering the lane, and quickly drew clear late while drifting in towards the rail in deep stretch. JACK
DON'T DRINK away well and stalked the leaders from along the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, and
finished from along the inside in the stretch drive to get up for the place in the closing strides. POWER OF INTENTION broke sharply and raced to the lead
from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail through the second turn and in the run down the backside, inherited the
lead approaching the final turn, was overtaken soon after entering the lane, and just failed to hold the place. ROX STAR KIDRUN lagged well back of the
early leaders while racing three wide through the stretch the first time, rallied five wide through the final turn, and improved his position late while finishing
three wide in the drive. COMMANDER B lagged well back early while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished
from along the inside in the stretch drive. FINALLY FANTASTIC settled off the early pacesetters while racing three out from the rail through the stretch the
first time, rallied four wide through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. MY GRAND VALENTINE stalked the leader
while racing three wide through the stretch the first time, maintained a striking position in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and faded over
the final furlong. STORM BEACH away alertly and pressed the pace one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, forced the issue to the final turn
before weakening.

Footnotes
PEPPERMINT broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside
and through the final turn, and finished determinedly from along the rail in the drive to hold off a late surge from WILD WOMAN to prevail. WILD WOMAN
stalked the leaders from along the rail through the stretch the first time, pulled her way into a tracking trip just behind the leaders in the run to the final turn,
rallied from just off the rail through the turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to just miss. MISS PRESLEY tracked the leaders through the stretch
the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive. RUGGED BEAUTY away alertly
and tracked the leaders three wide through the stretch the first time, loomed a threat while racing three wide entering the final turn, and finished five wide in
the drive. DONE THAT settled well off the early pace while racing three wide entering the stretch the first time, rallied five wide entering the final turn, but
was unable to make a late impact while finishing four out from the rail in the drive. PIPPA was off a step slow, and trailed the field into the first turn, bided
her time well back entering the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but was unable to overcome her tardy beginning. OUR ANJA away well
and dueled for the lead one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside, but weakened
entering the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

Footnotes
CASCADE BILLY broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, and drew clear in the drive to prove much the best. SLEW'S BAK broke through the gate prior to the start, and settled off
the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, shifted four wide leaving the turn, and
closed willingly three wide in the drive to get up for the place late. BAKTURA away alertly and pressed the pace three wide entering the backstretch, forced
the issue two out from the rail into the final turn, was unable to match strides with the winner through the turn, and just failed to hold the place while finishing
two wide in the drive. BACK ALLEY CAT unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, and finished
with late interest from along the rail in the drive. BOLD ARCH away well and pressed the leaders two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three
wide entering the final turn, but was outfinished late. TORINO GRAND stalked the contested early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive while unable to mount a late bid. ROBBIE MAC settled off the early
pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon.
