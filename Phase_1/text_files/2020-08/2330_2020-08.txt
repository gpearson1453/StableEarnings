Footnotes
LITTLE MAZZY was well placed early, angled out off the rial in the stretch, drew off late while being ridden out to win going away. WOODHAVEN KID was
unhurried early, rallied four wide on the turn, was no match for the winner late but was second best. MORE THUNDER pressed the early pace and gained
the lead at the quarter pole, was outfinished in the stretch. WON THE BYNG was allowed to settle early, had a mild bid while no threat. PROPER HUMOR
never far back on the inside, lacked a late response. OFFICER MATUTE well placed for three quarters, gave way in the stretch. MAKEANENTRANCE was
no factor. DRAMA AN VICTORY set the pace for almost three quarters, took a bad step at the quarter pole and was eased in the stretch and was vanned
off.

Footnotes
VOILA BABY set the pace, was with a clear lead, was challenged in mid stretch, responded and drew off, driving. WE HAP NOW contended throughout,
could not match strides late with the winner but held well for place. CODE NAME ROSIE was allowed to settle early, rallied in the stretch four wide and
closed willingly. LA SMARTY raced close up and needed more late. ALEXA G had good position throughout and went evenly late. WHY RUSH raced mid
pack and was no threat. SNIPER SIS was no menace. SQUARE PEG broke slowly, raced mid pack and tired late. NOTION'S BEAUTY was no threat.
FORTY CHARM LADY trailed.
