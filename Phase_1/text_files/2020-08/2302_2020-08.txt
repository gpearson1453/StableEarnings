Footnotes
MARTINI SUE bobbled leaving the gate precipitating a bump fest involving RING IN SILENCE, herself, NAKED ILLUSION and MUSKOKA LADY at the
start, forced the pace, bid near the far turn, dueled, was headed briefly in the stretch but battled through the final 16th and prevailed late. MUSKOKA LADY
bumped at the start, stalked the pace, bid at the 1/2 mile pole, dueled, led briefly in the stretch, battled late but was outfinished. DANCE THE SKY AWAY
was off slowly and settled in mid pack, chased three and four-wide on the turn and finished under a determined drive. NAKED ILLUSION, bumped at the
start, was rated off the pace, closed dramatically two-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. RING IN SILENCE was
bumped at the start, stalked the pace, chased two-wide into the stretch but had no closing response. SUNSET PHOENIX led briefly and was taken to the
rear, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn but did not menace. PLAYING SMART dueled, held a short lead on the backstretch, gave way
on the turn and dropped back. TANGO DANCER dueled on the first turn, stalked on the backstretch then faded on the turn.

Footnotes
PLUIE D'AVRIL raced four-wide into the first turn and moved up to stalk three-wide, lapped onto the leader through the far turn, dogged her through the
stretch and was up late under a drive. SAILING BY led into the first turn, set a reserved pace, was pressured on the far turn and gave way gave way
grudgingly in the late stages. CLAIRESSENCE, off slowly, was rated off the pace, chased three and four-wide on the far turn and finished with a strong rally.
BIG MAMBA raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn then chased gamely through the stretch. MUNCH AND CRUNCH stalked the pace, was
squeezed back at the far turn, continued to ride the rail then finished gamely between foes. I LOOK INCREDIBLE broke alertly then settled in a stalking
position, was hustled from the rail on the far turn, chased into the stretch but evened out late. FRESHIEINTHEFOREST was taken back at the start and
rated off the pace, was checked along the rail entering the far turn, was hustled along the closed with a mission through the stretch. MAMITA'S CHICA
raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn the finished evenly from the outside. CLASSY VISION was steadied a bit entering the first
turn and dropped well off the pace, rode the rail throughout and closed with some interest in the stretch. CALAIS COVE settled in range, was hustled
two-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response.

LUCKY GIRASOL raced in mid pack, closed angling from the rail to three-wide late turn, chased into the stretch, blew by the leader a furlong out and
finished under a hand ride. BELLA FIGURA broke alertly, stalked the pace from the rail, was blocked upper stretch, finally got to the outside and closed fast.
BURBANK ROAD led early, set a pressured pace from the rail, was passed a furlong out and chased in vain. AIRY FAIRY forced the pace, was blocked
upper stretch, lodged her bid a furlong out but was outkicked. SLYDINI forced the issue, bid in earnest late turn, was headed upper stretch and gave way
with a furlong to run. REXDALE settled off the pace, closed along the rail on the turn, angled out through the stretch and tendered a mild rally.
WESTLODGE INTRIGUE broke outward, stalked the pace, came three and four-wide through the turn but lacked a closing response. NORTHERN RUBY
broke outward, raced four and five-wide on the turn then lacked a rally.

Footnotes
CEFALO dueled from the rail, inherited a clear lead at the top of the stretch and held sway under a brisk hand ride. STARONTHEHORIZON stalked from the
rail, was steadied in tight quarters approaching the turn, moved to the rail early turn then chased through the stretch. TRAIL BLAZING ESSA dueled, drifted
out late turn and while still game through the stretch could not regain position. SOULA hopped at the start, stalked the pace from the rail, checked when
squeezed back near the turn, continued to save ground then closed between foes in the stretch. PARABLE settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on
the turn and finished under a determined stretch drive. LOST CORSAGE dropped back early, closed three-wide on the turn but failed to menace. THE
SUIR, at the rear of the pack in the early going, closed three to five-wide late turn and was closing in the stretch but was not a threat. STRIKING RED, in
range early, was hustled from mid pack on the turn then evened out in the stretch. RAISON LAYD, in mid pack early, chased from the rear then came two
and three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. ERICA'S ON BOARD broke outward, raced in striking range from the outside, came four and
five-wide through the turn, bore out approaching the top of the stretch then eased, crossed the wire and walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
INTO THE RUN THROUGH THE BACKSTRETCH CONCERNING CEFALO AND STARONTHEHORIZON. THERE WERE CLAIMS OF FOUL LODGED
BY THE RIDER OF SOULA AGAINST STARONTHEHORIZON AND BY THE RIDER OF STARONTHEHORIZON AGAINST CEFALO, BOTH CLAIMS OF
INTERFERENCE APPROACHING THE TURN. ALL CLAIMS WERE DISALLOWED AND THE STEWARDS' INQUIRY LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

Footnotes
FOREST DRIFT led quickly from the start, shook off a stalker and opened up a clear advantage midway turn, was engaged by a rival in upper stretch but
held safe under a vigorous hand ride. CARPE HORSESHOE chased along the inside, stayed on the rail until the eighth pole when coming out to bear down
on the two leaders, getting up to split that pair with a fortunate head bob. BELIEVING took back early to chase outside the top pair, came two to three wide
to go after the winner at the quarter pole, had dead aim on the rival but wouldn't change leads and hung in the final sixteenth, losing the head bob for place.
BAHIA GIRL hopped in the air at the start and was at the rear early, came up the rail until mid turn, angled out to the four path turning for home and closed
with good energy down the lane, despite running greenly and trying to lug in. MS WICKED was off the pace and along the inside, trailed into the turn before
commencing a strong rally down the stretch, besting the balance while matching the close of the fourth place finisher. MUSICAL RIDE stalked the leader
until midway on the turn, dropped back gradually until the eighth pole, then drifted in and lost positions the final sixteenth. EASY ACCESS had a perfect gap
trip in mid pack, was asked to go after the leaders as the field turned for home but had no response for the stretch drive. GOTE GO off the pace early, came
two to four wide trying to get into it on the turn but could only close the gap marginally without threatening. HI HONEY was off the pace and three wide into
the turn, fell back to trail midway around the bend but managed to only pass a few stragglers in the final furlong. WAR EMPRESS settled in mid pack, was
hard ridden to stay in touch on the turn and regressed down the stretch. WHO'S WHO INTHEZOO was off the pace early and moved up into mid pack by
the turn but had nothing left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
JUMPING JILL FLASH settled in mid pack, closed along the rail late turn, angled out a bit upper stretch, bid mid stretch and drove clear. FEELING FUNNY
dueled two-wide, wore down NEPTUNE'S PEARL mid stretch but was quickly passed, chased and held place. BUNCHKINS raced in mid pack, closed
two-wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch and rallied gamely. APPELLA stalked the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn, chased into the
stretch and finished under a determined drive. LETTER ROLL broke inward and settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then rallied
belatedly. NEPTUNE'S PEARL dueled from the rail, gave way mid stretch and lacked a further response. OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY settled off the pace
after a good beginning, closed along the rail through the turn then evened out in the late stages. MOB PRINCESS was pinched back at the start and settled
in mid pack, was hustled angling from two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but was lugging in and failed to menace. LOTS TO LIKE broke
outward, settled in range, came four then three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but had no response when asked.

HATMAKER HOLIDAY led quickly, set a reserved pace then held sway under a drive. FOR MY ELBI stalked the pace, chased from the rail and two-wide on
the turn then finished under a determined drive. MITZI ducked in at the gap and settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail on the turn the finished
gamely in vain. SUPER LUNAR was used early but failed to make the lead and settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then
finished gamely. IL MALOCCHIO was pinched back at the start,raced in mid pack, was hustled three then two-wide on the turn and closed with some
interest. HEKLA'S AURA settled in mid pack, came two-wide through the turn then finished gamely. LEAVE IT WITH ME raced from off the pace, was
hustled along the rail through the turn but never reached contention. MORE SAVVY hopped out of the gate and moved up to press the pace, chased two
and three-wide on the turn but had no closing response. SILENT BUT VIOLENT raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide through the turn then finished
evenly. SECRETLY bumped with ENDORPHIN RUSH leaving the gate, was in range early then was hustled four and five-wide on the turn but lacked a
closing response. ENDORPHIN RUSH bumped with SECRETLY at the start, maintained striking distance, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but
tired a furlong out. DANCING NOTE raced in mid pack, was checked late backstretch and dropped back then trailed the field home.

Footnotes
FACT CHECKING was off the pace and trailing late turn, split rivals in upper stretch to get into contention, then got a seam between the leaders at the
seventy yard pole, driving through to get up in time. DOUBLE MEDAL was off the pace, came two to four wide rallying into the stretch to have her sights set
on the leaders, closed widest but could not match the energy of the winner, second best today. SHORT SUMMER DRESS sped to the lead, held it while
being stalked throughout the turn, still had a clear advantage to the sixteenth pole but was headed seventy yards out, battling on to the wire. ROMAN
D'ORO was off the pace, was rallying with the eventual place finisher when her path disappeared by the three sixteenths, re-grouped to rally again outside,
closing best of all in the final forty yards. ISHIYAYA stalked the leader throughout, was hustled to bid for the front in upper stretch but couldn't match and
then faded back in the final sixteenth. LET'S HAVE FUN chased the leaders along the inside into the stretch, losing ground and positions in the final
sixteenth. BETWIXTING sat in mid pack, moved into range on hold while two to four wide around the turn, tiring on her wrong lead and dropping back in the
final eighth. PRINCESS FABIANA was along the rail and hard held early, came out three wide midway on the turn to have dead aim on the leaders but
couldn't sustain her bid and was outrun down the lane. SILVER DAHLIA was chasing the leaders outside when a rival didn't handle the turn, forced into the
six path midway on the bend and into the eight or nine path turning for home, horse and rider losing interest from that point when hopelessly out of it.
REVIVALIST was taken a hold of and stumbled when chasing the leaders into the turn, stayed wide while trying to stay in contention but faded out in upper
stretch and was let gallop in from there. She was given a ride home in the van to be on the safe side.

Footnotes
SALTINI got off slowly, stalked the pace from the rail, chased two-wide into the stretch and swept to the lead a 16th out under a drive. FLORIDA WON, in
range, came two and three-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. CANMORE, off slowly, raced two-wide
throughout, chased on the far turn, bid a 16th out but was outkicked. MARTEN RIVER led quickly, set a reserved pace, quickened on the far turn was
engaged by CANMORE a 16th out and was immediately passed by the winner. BE VEWY VEWY QUIET raced in mid pack, saved ground on the turns and
finished gamely. FIRST SPRING settled off the pace, rode the rail throughout and chased through the stretch. FEDERAL LAW bumped with GORGEOUS
KITTEN and EPILOGUE at the start then was rated off the pace, raced on the second path through both turns but encountered traffic in the stretch and was
not a threat. CERRADO, in mid pack early, came two and three-wide on the far turn then lacked a closing response. GORGEOUS KITTEN, bumped at the
start, was rated off the pace then hustled four-wide on the far turn but was never in contention. EPILOGUE, bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, was
hustled three and four-wide on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
MARJORIE'S DREAM led after a brief duel, moved clear early turn, set a reserved pace, widened from upper stretch and was easing up through the final
16th. TRADING BAY broke inwards and bunped OHMYSHE'SSOFINE, pressed the pace on the backstretch, chased two-wide on the turn then was
determined to hold place in the stretch. MRS. DEL broke alertly but could not maintain the lead, stalked the pacesetter three-wide, chased to the stretch
then evened out in the late stages. SIMPLE SOUVENIR stalked the pace early then dropped back at the turn, was hustled along the rail, angled out in the
stretch and rallied gamely. LA BESTIA raced in mid pack, saved ground on the turn, chased into the stretch then finished evenly. WORDS OF GOLD settled
in mid pack, chased two and three-wide on the turn but had no response in the stretch. WIDE AWAKE settled off the pace, was hustled angling two to
four-wide through the turn then chased to the end. CITY FASHION forced the early pace, dropped back late turn but lacked a rally. LINDA LOVES LACE
raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but was never in contention. COULD BE FATE settled off the early pace, chased four-wide
on the turn but flattened out in the final furlong. PLAY IT SMART settled off the pace, was hustled five then four-wide on the turn but never reached
contention. OHMYSHE'SSOFINE was bumped at the start and settled off the pace, angled inward from the third path to the rail early turn and lacked a rally.
