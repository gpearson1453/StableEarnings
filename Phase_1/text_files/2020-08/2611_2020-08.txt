Footnotes
DEAUVILLE MIST advanced inside to share the lead midway on the backstretch, drifted out some entering the lane, gradually edged ahead as she slowly
drifted out, moved clear inside the last eighth and held sway under steady handling. ARCH FLYER pressed from outside, went for the lead on the turn, was
carried out by DEAUVILLE MIST into the stretch then gradually angled out to stay clear of the latter, lacked the extra needed but was clearly second best.
RED JERSEY without early speed, progressed two wide on the bend, took the rail into the lane, had every chance but could only hold onto third late. MISS
LEARJET chased from outside, lost ground widest through the turn and could only improve position through the stretch without threatening. AIR ELLIE
advanced from inside to gain a striking position on the bend, came off the inside some for the stretch run and also gradually drifted out as she gave way.
FILLY FROM ILLY displayed early speed just outside DEAUVILLE MIST but gave way between horses before finishing a half mile. SHRIMP prominent
toward the outside on the backstretch, faded four wide on the turn.

Footnotes
AUNDREYA'S BOY was kept close from outside, in path four on the bend, forced out further into the lane, edged ahead inside the final furlong and held on
under drive. LEE LA DEW angled in midway on the backstretch, progressed two wide between horses on the turn, took the rail upper stretch, squeezed
through a narrowing path inside MONFORD in the late going and gained second. MONFORD disputed the pace off the rail but inside rivals on the
backstretch, stayed just off the inside on the turn, drifted out entering the lane, bumped twice with BEE ATTACK, retreated some but did not relent and
caught the latter for third at the wire. BEE ATTACK was sent to contest the pace just outside MONFORD, was carried out by the latter and bumped twice
entering the lane, fought gamely but also lacked the extra needed deep stretch. DONNER PASS chased from inside, angled out through the bend, came
into the stretch from path five, improved position between rivals upper stretch then leveled off. LOOKIN' AT MIKE raced in contention from outside on the
backstretch but faded widest on the turn. HARD WHISKEY soon trailed, stayed well off the inside throughout and showed little. CHILLY RED ACCOUNT
was a factor from inside for a half mile then gave way.

Footnotes
LETHAL LEANNE advanced from inside to soon share the lead with RUBY LEES SONG, moved clear when allowed on the turn, was roused leaving the
bend and steadily pulled away under urging through the stretch. SEATTLE TRAIN chased from between horses, picked up her pace three wide on the turn,
fanned out some for the drive and battled for second. WOOD NOT MIND in contention from outside, lost ground four to six wide taking the bend, angled in
some midstretch, showed a willingness to run late between rivals and got up for third near the wire. SEE GRACE FLY BY was a factor just off the inside
from the beginning, gradually progressed to duel for second in the stretch but did not have enough left in the waning yards. CAROL'S A CASE prominent
toward the outside, was three to five wide through the turn then could only make up minor ground the final furlong on the second flight. DANCING HIGH
trailed from inside then showed a willingness to run along the rail the last two furlongs. RUBY LEES SONG broke alertly, was soon engaged from inside, did
not stay with LETHAL LEANNE on the bend, floated out some entering the stretch and flattened out between rivals.

Footnotes
HALO HUNTER was sent to a clear early lead then rated just off the rail, floated out some entering the stretch and gradually lengthened command under a
drive. BUMPTYBUMPBUMP in contention from outside, angled in nearing the turn, closed the gap along the rail, moved clear for second upper stretch then
could only hold his position late. ROSKI bumped with FLIT N TIME at the break, raced closest to HALO HUNTER from outside, threatened on the bend,
floated out into the lane and gradually yielded. CHERNYAHOVSKIY saved ground taking the turn and failed to have a significant stretch bid. PETEIZUM
closed the gap two wide on the bend to reach contention but weakened for the drive. UNCLE NEARIS also bumped with FLIT N TIME at the start, showed
no speed, stayed well off the inside taking the turn and had no late bid. FLIT N TIME was pinched back at the break and always outrun.

Footnotes
JOLIE RULER reluctant to load, shared the early lead from between horses, was just off the rail on the bend, moved clear leaving the turn and held off
TAP'S LULLABY under steady handling. TAP'S LULLABY pressed from between rivals, advanced three wide on the turn, took over second upper stretch,
rallied belatedly but was clearly second best. SWAMP WITCH HADDY was away slowly, progressed from outside under urging through the turn and gained
third from between rivals near the wire. DIAMOND STELLAR contested the pace from inside on the backstretch, was steadied briefly when her path
narrowed into the bend, stayed along the rail through the turn, was angled off the rail with a sixteenth left and lacked a significant bid. DIAMOND GUCCI
dwelt at the break, spotting the field a handful of lengths, lost ground taking the turn very wide then closed well. TOUCH BY FELICTY bore in at the start,
vied for the early lead from outside, was in path three on the turn but gave way leaving the bend and faded between horses. BOWS N LACE also reluctant
to load, was an contender just off the inside on the backstretch but gave way with three furlongs to go. FLASHY LOOK hesitated then was forced inward by
TOUCH BY FELICTY, raced in contention from outside on the backstretch but gave way on the bend. The rider of DIAMOND STELLAR lodged an objection
alleging interference from JOLIE RULER into the turn. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
YOU'RE KILLIN ME rated from outside, was roused four wide on the bend, took a narrow advantage under a drive nearing the sixteenth marker then moved
clear in the waning yards. SHMILY pressed from between horses, was three then four wide taking the bend, vied for the lead midstretch, lugged in some
inside the sixteenth marker and lacked the needed late kick. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN without early speed, picked up his pace to reach contention three wide
on the turn, lost ground fanning widest for the drive and gained third in the waning yards. CROCE D'ORO bobbled a few strides from the gate, was hustled
along to contest the pace from outside, three wide through the bend, edged ahead in the lane but could not sustain his bid inside the last eighth.
HELLOFAGUY soon trailed from just off the inside, angled out for a clear path midstretch and passed a couple tired foes. SIRCORRI vied for the lead
between rivals from the beginning but flattened out for the drive. TAP'S BIG SHOT displayed early speed inside horses then also flattened out in the lane.

Footnotes
TOUR ON was bumped shortly after the break, rated from outside, commenced her bid three wide on the turn, fanned out behind MY WIFE IS BOSS into
the lane, moved outside that one midstretch, gained the advantage with seventy yards to go and kept MAY BE SUSPECT at bay. MAY BE SUSPECT
without early speed, was four wide on the bend, lost further ground fanning six wide for the stretch run, closed well but was too late. FOGGY KITTEN soon
had a clear lead and the inside, was challenged nearing the half mile marker, shook free again leaving the bend but did not have enough left deep stretch.
MY WIFE IS BOSS was hustled from the gate and bumped TOUR ON leaving the chute, pressed from outside, vied for the lead three wide on the turn,
fanned out some for the stretch run and lacked the extra needed in the late going. BELLAH DOWN prominent from the beginning, was just off the inside
taking the turn, waited for a clear path upper stretch, split rivals two wide inside the furlong marker and was closing the gap through the waning yards. ICE
ATTACK was well placed from inside through the bend but gradually wore down for the drive. PINK FOR ME a step slow at the start, saved ground taking
the turn, angled out widest upper stretch and made up minor ground. DON'T DALLY pressed FOGGY KITTEN from just outside, went for the lead on the
turn but flattened out the final three-sixteenths. SING KITTY SING rank at the start, showed little once under control.
