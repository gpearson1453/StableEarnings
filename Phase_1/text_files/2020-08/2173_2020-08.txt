Footnotes
BURNIN' POCKETS stalked the pacesetters from the two path, found running along the rail into the lane, gained the lead at the top of the stretch and held
sway. TIMELESS TALES trailed outside and finished with good energy outside getting by late for place. CAPTAIN WILL contended the early pace from the
three path, rallied four wide into the stretch and was out kicked for place. TRANSPLANT contested the pace inside, drifted out to the two path at the top of
the lane then was overtaken by BURNIN' POCKETS into the stretch and weakened late. DARE TO ENTER settle in range from the four path and bid
belatedly. STOCKWATCHER reserved off the pacesetters early from the four path, lodged a mild bid into the lane and yielded.

Footnotes
TIZTHUNDERINOW prompted the early pace along the rail, dueled through the backstretch inside of SMILEY, disposed of rival into the lane, responded to
challenge from WISER TIMES into the stretch, dug in the final yards and won the nod. WISER TIMES shuffled back in the opening turn, raced three to four
wide through the backstretch in striking distance, was asked to quicken in the final turn, ranged up menacingly at the top of the stretch, matched strides in
the late stretch and was narrowly denied. SILVER PRAIRIE stumbled leaving then was checked racing three to four wide into the opening turn, sat mid pack
through the backstretch, gained closer order under encouragement and failed to threaten in the drive. COMMISSION MAN raced four wide into the opening
turn, chased from the far turn then rallied inside and flattened out in the drive. SMILEY contested the early pace, dueled outside of the eventual winner, was
unable to move with rival at the quarter pole and tired. FROST CANYON reserved off the pacesetters from the four path and retired early. DIEGO'S DAY
checked leaving the opening turn and never reached contention.

EMISSARY saved ground inside, shifted out to the two path at the quarter pole, was all out late but was unable to reach the winner late. LITTLE BRIAN
settled outside and rallied late for show. REFLECTIONOFVALUES shifted outside leaving the backstretch and closed late. PEYTONS PRINCE vied inside
for the early lead then settled off the quick pace, chased through the final turn and then weakened. BIONIC BIRD sprinted clear into the backstretch, was
quickly overtaken at the quarter pole and had nothing left in reserve. CATCH ME IF U CAN saved ground inside and failed to menace.

Footnotes
IRISH GOLD sprinted clear after an alert getaway, was well rated under a snug hold while showing the way through the backstretch, stay clear through the
stretch and won handily. PACIORETTY raced in closest pursuit, rallied three wide outside of MR. KALYPSO and got up just in time for place honors. MR.
KALYPSO settled just off the rail in striking range, rallied inside of PACIORETTY into the stretch and was bested late for place. DOUBLE BEAR never far
back outside, gained closer order in the far turn, chased into the stretch but lacked the kick that was needed. WHERE'S THE GOLD sat outside and lacked
a serious bid. RAINY BAY trailed from the four path and passed tiring rival. FROBISHER BAY settled mid pack from the four path and was done early.

Footnotes
SHIMSHINE last away from the gate, trailed the field through the backstretch, advanced quickly in the final turn then responded to handling into the stretch,
angled out sharply and got up late. ZIPPITY ZAP prompted the pace from the rail, inherited the lead into the far turn, came under a drive into the stretch
under urging and was caught late. BAR NO Q broke alertly then settled off the pace outside, angled towards the rail leaving the backstretch, loomed boldly
at the three sixteenth pole, shifted out finding running room and lacked the rally needed. STRIDERS RING sat just off the pace outside, fanned five wide into
the turn and rallied belatedly outside. SMARTY RIVER PANTS sat just off the pace under a snug hold, fanned four wide leaving the backstretch, drifted
inward at the top of the lane and weakened late. HALLIE'S HERO pressed three to four wide in the opening stages, was unable to sustain the bid required,
checked at the quarter pole and yielded. MOON KING dueled from the three path outside of ZIPPITY ZAP, could not keep pace with the field and retired
early.

Footnotes
DENSE FOG lacked early foot, quickly moved up into contention through the backstretch, split rivals into the lane and drove clear late. HARD TO COME
HOME contested the pace from the four path, prompted action into the final turn from between rivals, gained the lead into the lane and weakened inside
late. JOVIAL DESTINY stalked the pacesetters, circled into the lane and rallied mildly to get up for show. TRANG allowed to settle early, chased from the
quarter pole and rallied inside and flattened. FACTORED IN away slow, trailed the field and showed a mild interest late. ZUCCHINI lacked a serious bid.
POKER TABLE away well outside, pressed the pace four wide into the far turn and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. WEST OF SABINAL vied inside,
was unable to move on with rivals and tired at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
RAYREADY went three wide into the opening turn, settled three wide in the second flight, was asked to quicken in the final turn, went wide into the lane,
rallied steadily on the far outside into the stretch and got up just in time. CASH REWARD contested the early pace under a snug hold, dueled inside of THIN
LINE through the backstretch to three sixteenth pole, edged away from rival at the into the stretch and was nipped late. WATER WAGON trailed the field
early, settled outside through the backstretch, raced wide on the final turn, closed outside and was along in time. GO WILD settled inside entering the
backstretch, responded to mild encouragement into the stretch, shifted out late stretch and was out kicked. THIN LINE quickly went to the front, engaged
CASH REWARD in a dueled for the lead,came under heavy steady urging into the stretch and gave way. BOLSANO secured an inside position into the turn,
angled out to the three path in the backstretch, gained a closer order at the quarter pole and gave way in stretch. NEVER EVEREVER offered little. THE
HYBRID stalked the pacesetters early and tired. **JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of GO WILD against the rider of RAYREADY
alleging interference at the three eighths pole was not allowed after review of the Stewards.

Footnotes
FLORIST pressed four to five wide, fanned three wide into the far turn, rallied determinedly outside and edged away late. PENNY A POINT lacked early
speed, trailed the field entering the lane, swung out and rallied steadily getting by late for place. SOMETHING ABOUT ME set a pressured pace from just off
the rail, responded to challenge from FLORIST into the lane and was edged out late. WHOOP IT UP reserved off the leaders early, raced four wide through
the far turn then was roused into the lane and closed outside but missed out for show. PARCAM COWGIRL settled outside, chased outside in the final turn,
rallied in traffic into the stretch and was out kicked. CITY OF PEARLS tracked inside, lost ground into the far turn, lodged a bid into the stretch and faded.
LYLA LORRAINE vied four wide in the opening stages, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, dropped back into the lane and yielded. FAIRY BARB
showed some mild interest late. LEENA chased throughout. DAZZLING CHIC hustled away, prompted the pace outside, was unable to keep pace and
stopped.
