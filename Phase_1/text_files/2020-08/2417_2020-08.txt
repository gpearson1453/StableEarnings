Footnotes
DIDDLEY sprinted to the early lead, set a pressured pace, shook clear into the stretch then widened and finished under a hand ride. FINE GRIT, bumped at
the outset, stalked the pace, chased from the rail on the turn then finished under a determined drive. R U WATCHINGBUD settled in mid pack, closed three
and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. EXECUTIVE SIGHT broke outward and bumped FINE GRIT, settled off the pace,
was hustled along the rail through the turn then finished gamely but failed to menace. WEEKEND WIZARD pressed the pace, chased hard two-wide on the
turn, was all out in the stretch but evened out in the late stages. GROUNDHOG DAY raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then
flattened out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
AREOCENTRIC stalked the pace, closed two-wide late turn, took command in the final furlong and held sway under a drive. NASHVILLE KNIGHT led onto
the main track, set the pace, quickened on the turn, failed to contain the winner in the final furlong but held place. LOKINFORPURSEMONEE raced in mid
pack, chased hard three-wide late turn, launched a determined drive and gained steadily to the end. CUMMINGS ROAD settled in mid pack, was hustled
along the rail through the turn then finished gamely in vain. MAGICAL BREEZE, taken well off the early pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn then
while unable to menace, was still coming in the stretch and closed a gap.. MAJESTIC FEVER raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide then on the rail
through the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to threaten. GIANT MINE hopped out of the gate, settled in mid pack, came three and four-wide through
the turn then lacked a rally.

KILLAG KATIE stalked the pace, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, rallied in the stretch and got up late, driving. MIZZONA had brief
speed then stalked the pace, raced three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, was under an all out drive, gained a short lead in the final 16th but was
caught late. JUXTAPOSE forced the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch, launched a determined bid mid stretch but was outkicked. SUBZERO PLUS
set a pressured pace, shook clear mid turn but was caught mid stretch and gave way. FOREST HALO stalked the pace, chased three and four-wide on the
turn, lost ground at the top of the stretch and chased to the end. WITHOUT A DOUBT forced the pace to the turn then dropped back and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
VICTOR'S DYNASTY broke outward then settled in mid pack, rode the rail early turn then closed two-wide to the stretch, bid a furlong out and drove clear
then held sway under steady pressure. SILENCIUM broke inward, forced the pace from the rail, took command early turn, shook clear, was engaged a
furlong out and cleared by that rival but held place. WHITE WEDDING settled in mid pack, closed along the rail late turn, angled out between foes in the
stretch and finished gamely. TRAPPEZE ARTIST stalked the pace, closed four and five-wide on the turn, was hustled into the stretch and chased to the
end. LILLZ NOT CRYING settled at the back of the pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and finished
gamely. BET ALPHA stalked the pace, came two-wide through the turn but evened out in the stretch. PAPA D had early speed, set a pressured pace, was
headed early turn, pressed the issue to late turn and backed away.
