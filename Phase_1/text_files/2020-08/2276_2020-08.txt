Footnotes
MOOSEWOOD settled off the leaders in the three path, continued in the same path through the far turn edging closer, found room between rivals at the top
of the stretch, dueled late and prevailed. KARAOKE CAT set the early pace from just off the rail, was overtaken leaving the first turn and pressed inside,
regained command about the three-eighths pole, was clear into upper stretch then dueled late and missed. KEEP ON ZENON ON tucked in behind the
leading pair into the first turn, tracked from the two path before moving out four deep leaving that bend, went four to five wide on the far turn within range,
needed more. HIT A LICK settled along the inside off the leaders, continued to save ground on the far turn before moving out a bit late on that bend, ran on
in the stretch. G M GAGE broke a step slowly and clipped heels after the break, was devoid of speed despite some encouragement, ran mostly in the two to
three path and belatedly gain. I B EZ clipped in behind after the start, pressed the pace three to four wide, took a narrow lead from the five-eighths to the
three-eighths, drifted out a bit leaving the far turn still going three to four wide on that bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
WISKEY CROWN broke outwardly brushing a rival, attended the pace from outside, went three to four wide on the turn, edged away in mid-stretch despite
lugging out a bit near the sixteenth pole, held sway. ALMOST A STORM was brushed at the break, stalked outside the second flight four to five wide on the
turn, came six deep into upper stretch drawing nearly even at the top of the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. QUANTICO JOE was bumped at the
break, tracked in behind the leaders off the inside, went in the three path on the turn coming out a bit into upper stretch, was taken hold and altered in near
the sixteenth as the leader came out, ran on but missed the place. IMPUTED shifted in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the rail through the turn but
steadied slightly late on that bend, ran on thereafter. SEND THE STORM raced outside off the leaders, went three to four wide on the turn, came out six
deep turning for home and failed to rally. INSOMNIA bumped the inside rival at the start then steadied, tucked in and saved ground on or just off the rail
through the turn racing at the rear, came out four wide into upper stretch and made no bid. JAZZ TOWN broke awkwardly, was coaxed forward inside to vie
for the lead but off the rail, went in the two to three path on the turn and came up empty. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

Footnotes
COWBOY TOBY broke a bit awkwardly, was mildly coaxed forward inside rivals to set the tempo after the opening quarter, edged clear into upper stretch
having saved ground on the turn but drifted out throughout the stretch while holding safe. BUMBLEBEE came in and bumped with rivals at the start,
attended the pace from outside, went six wide into the turn moving in a path on that bend, could make no headway on the winner but was clearly second
best. ETERNAL KINGDOM came out and bumped with rivals at the start, shifted in while settling at the rear, ran on or just off the rail on the turn edging
closer into upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. AIREDALE pressed from between rivals, went three wide on the turn, was outfinished for show
honors. DOUBLEDOWN DREAMER was outside rivals going seven then six wide on the turn and failed to rally. NO DOUBT was bumped between rivals at
the start, chased from between foes five wide into the turn then weakened. ENROUTE was ridden along four wide and between runners into the turn, came
up empty.

Footnotes
A ZENON NITE settled, shifted in up the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, bid inside in mid-stretch and edged clear. KRIS WHO was urged at the
break, set the pace off the rail, went in the two path on the turn, drifted out through the lane while unable to kick on with the winner. SILENT ZENON raced
outside the second group going five wide on the turn, was carried out a bit in the stretch and captured show honors. SILVER SECRET R F pressed inside
for a bit, switched outside KRIS WHO going three wide by the five-sixteenths, was carried out a bit in the stretch and lacked the needed late bid. AUSSIE
YOU LATER chased inside foes but off the fence in behind the leading pair, went from the three path to the two path on the turn and failed to rally in the
lane. QUIEN ES was kept four to six deep on the turn dropping back to last and failed to threaten. DIVE BAR chased between rivals four wide into the turn
then weakened.

Footnotes
SHARPSHOOTINGEORGE settled last but one racing a path or two removed from the fence, began to advance three then four wide on the far turn, swung
six deep into upper stretch and drove past late. KEATON broke outwardly, stalked from between runners four wide early, encouraged along four wide on the
far turn striking the lead by the head of the stretch, lugged in at that juncture and lugged out late and was outkicked. POLITICAL LOOPHOLE switched out
to stalk the leader in the two to three path, went three wide on the far turn, ran on evenly in the stretch. TRUCKSTOP AFFAIR cleared the field heading
down the stretch the first time and shifted in, dictated terms on or just off the rail, was overtaken leaving the far turn and weakened in the stretch. PACIFIC
OCEAN tracked on or just off the rail, came out in the stretch, made it back to the unsaddling area and at that point was vanned off. THIRSTY MONKEY
tracked outside five wide early, dropped back and shifted in going two wide on the far turn and failed to rally. WISKEYS DREAMS was caught six wide into
the first turn but taken back and shifted in early on that bend to be three deep and in pursuit, went two to four wide on the far turn and could not threaten.
SUN TREADER broke a step slowly, kept in the four to five path while trailing and was never a threat.
