Footnotes
BORSA VENTO set all the pace while racing along the inside down the backstretch, raced two wide through the stretch and held gamely under all out
pressure. MY EMINENCE pressed the early leader while racing two wide, raced four wide in the stretch and drive and was clearly second best.
SHOTMASTER was allowed to settle early, raced three wide at the eighth pole and had not enough late. THE MONEY TRAIN stalked the pace along the
inside and weakened through the lane. ROMAN WARRIOR raced four wide around the first turn, settled off the early pace, raced four wide into the upper
stretch and never was a factor.

PLAY THE MAX set all the pace and held gamely to prevail under strong handling. GYPSY GIRL pressed the early leader, was bothered by the loose horse
nearing the eighth pole and kept on to the wire. ANY MINUTE NOW stalked the early pace, raced towards the inside and finished willingly to the wire. LA
SMARTY settled off the early pace, raced three wide in the lane and had no late response. LWF DRIVE BYE GAL was unhurried early, raced five wide into
the upper stretch and never was a factor. FORTY CHARM LADY was off slowly and raced far back. CODE NAME ROSIE was held on to longer at the break
and unseated his rider. Stewards declared Code Name Rosie a non-starter for the unfair break.

Footnotes
SOLAR WARMING pressed the pace, raced just off the inside in the stretch and finished gamely under all out pressure. CHARGING LION showed good
speed while racing two wide, raced in the four path through the stretch and finished well under strong handling. GLENGAR was reluctant to load, stalked the
early pace, moved up between rivals nearing the sixteenth, was blocked and finished willingly to the wire. Glengar jockey filed an objection for interference
nearing the sixteenth pole and stewards ruled no change. RELISHMENT stalked the early pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no final winning
bid. IWISHIWASPECIAL raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. FLEDERMAUS raced far back and never threatened. STORM
PROPHET raced far back and was distanced.
