final turn, maintained her advantage into the lane, jumped the gate tracks and fended off the closers late to prove best. RAILWAY broke sharply and tracked
the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed one out from the rail in the drive. BROAD
APPROVAL away well and was bumped slightly midway through the first turn, while holding a tracking trip into the backstretch from between rivals, rallied
two wide through the final turn, and finished evenly from along the rail in the stretch drive. LADY SHIRA was squeezed and taken up in the opening strides
and trailed the field into the backstretch, launched her bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, and finished best of
all. ALBERTA MOON was off a step slow. and stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and
finished one out from the rail in the drive. VALUED tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied four wide through the
final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive. ZOOMZOOM stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied four

Footnotes
TORIADOR away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final
turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to hold off a late charge by HE'S RELENTLESS to prevail. HE'S RELENTLESS settled off the early pace
while saving ground along the inside entering the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the
inside entering the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed with a rush to just miss, and proved easily second best. SET TO SHINE away
well and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, loomed a threat while racing two wide approaching the final
turn, but was unable to make a late impact while finishing one out from the rail in the drive. RODE TO GALIANO unhurried early while dropping back to trail,
rallied along the inside through the final turn, and improved his position over the final furlong without ever threatening. FLY AWAY was off a step slow, but
raced into a stalking trip while one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, pulled her way into a tracking trip entering the backstretch while saving
ground along the inside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded over the late stages. FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR broke sharply and tracked the
pacesetter into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, continued from a tracking trip in the run down the backstretch, but weakened
entering the final turn.

RANGER UP away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace through the second turn and in
the run down the backside, took control soon after entering the final turn, and drew clear late. ASTRONOMICAL broke sharply and pressed the leader into
the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, was no match for the winner in the lane, but battled gamely
to hold the place. THE VALENTINE KID settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, rallied smartly two wide
entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to just miss the place. SPECIALIST settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail
entering the stretch the first time, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, angled in leaving the turn, and closed one out from the rail in the
drive while finding his best stride late. STAY ALL NIGHT away well and tracked the leaders from along the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to
save ground at the rail while holding a tracking trip in the run to the final turn, rallied along the inside through the turn, but was outfinished late.
ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER tracked the leaders two out from the rail entering the stretch the first time while under snug restraint, rallied four wide through
the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. ROX STAR KIDRUN settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail
entering the stretch the first time, trailed the field into the final turn, and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
LITTLE GROOT away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace through the second turn and in
the run down the backstretch, maintained his lead through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. MASTER EWEN settled off the early pace
while saving ground at the rail, launched his game from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail to get up for the
place in the final strides. SQUARE DANCER broke sharply and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied
three wide entering the final turn, and closed two out from the rail in the drive and just failed to hold the place. ACE DEUCE away well and stalked the early
pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive. CRAZY
PROPHET settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, raced four out from the rail in the run down the
backstretch, rallied five wide through the final turn, and continued five wide in the stretch drive while unable to pose a late threat. BETATHANABOYFRIEND
stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid
while finishing four wide in the drive. SWORD FIGHTER settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, rallied
two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing at the rail.

WE GOT IT COVERED settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, took a
narrow advantage in mid stretch and inched clear. SCULPTED away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured
pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, bore out leaving the turn, but finished willingly from the
center of the track to finish on even terms with UPTOWN FUNKY CAT for the place. UPTOWN FUNKY CAT stalked the leaders into the backstretch while
racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive. OPA was bumped repeatedly in the run through the
stretch the first time and settled at the back of the pack entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished with late interest two
out from the rail in the drive. KEEPINGTHEDREAM stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied from along the rail
entering the final turn, and closed at the rail in the drive. POWER OF INTENTION broke sharply and tracked the leaders while racing one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn and loomed a danger entering the lane, but needed more late. ACTION WANTED
away well and pressed the pace one out from the rail entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue into the final turn while being carried three wide,
but faded over the final furlong. DISCRETIONARY settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied four wide through the
final turn, but needed more late. MY GRAND VALENTINE settled well off the early pace while racing three out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied

CUSHMAN ROAD broke sharply and pressed the pace three wide entering the backstretch, assumed control approaching the final turn, held a clear lead
into the lane, and just lasted. ICELAND tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and
closed with a rush while dropping to the rail in mid stretch to just miss. TAKE CHARGE GWEN bumped at the start, but gained a stalking trip while racing
two out from the rail entering the backside. ASPIRED was bumped soon after the start, and clipped heels before settling well off the early pace while racing
one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied four wide through the final turn, and closed determinedly three out from the rail in the drive while
gaining late. BACKSEAT RIDER stalked the leaders from just off the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but needed
more late while finishing one out from the rail in the drive. ZEN BABY away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a
pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside, was overtaken approaching the final turn, rallied from just off the rail through the final turn,
but was outfinished late. TIMELESS SHRUG settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering
the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. PROUD WOMAN away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the rail from
between rivals entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

Footnotes
HONKY TONK WOMAN away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the backstretch, forced the issue two wide in the run down the
backside and through the final turn, assumed command entering the lane, and inched clear while finishing three out from the rail in the drive. DAY PASS
was pinched slightly at the start, but raced into a tracking trip from along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn,
and closed willingly two wide in the drive to get up for the place. LA BELLE FLEUR tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the
rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. LOTS OF LOVE broke sharply and vied for the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and finished from along
the rail in the drive in a game effort. DONE THAT settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive. MISS PRESLEY stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, rallied
four wide entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive. SARA away well, but steadied sharply off of heels approaching the first turn, held a
stalking trip two out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but had little to offer late. MIA BELIZE
unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and showed little.

Footnotes
SANAWAR settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and
continued determinedly three wide in the drive to prove best. HONK broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch,
maintained a clear advantage into the final turn, was overtaken in mid stretch, but battled gamely to prove second best. DAKATI away well and tracked the
leader two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed from along the inside in the drive to grab
a share. ALWAYS SUNNY lagged well off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn,
but needed more late while finishing four wide in the drive. COURTSHIP away alertly and stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the
rail, pulled his way into a tracking trip at the rail in the run to the final turn, shifted off the rail entering the lane, and finished five wide while unable to pose a
late threat. WILLING TO TRAVEL lagged well back early while racing one out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and was unable to
make a late impact while finishing three wide in the drive. ELWOOD J went to bucking soon after the start, causing the rider to lose his irons, trailed the field
throughout, and was only able to pass a tiring rival late, while unable to overcome the early miscue. SIR BARCLAY tracked the leader in the run down the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, began to drop back entering the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.
