Footnotes
DESTINY WHO shifted in early, saved ground on the turn tracking off the leaders, edged closer late on that bend while coming off the fence past the
three-sixteenths, moved between rivals three wide at the head of the stretch, took charge just past the furlong marker, was soon clear and held sway under
a drive. RUN LIKE KATE raced outside foes off the leaders early, went mostly four wide on the turn before angling six deep out of that bend, chased the
winner home but could make no headway. ALL STEAMED UP was forwardly-placed to set the pace facing some outside pressure, was inside then in the
two path on the turn, weakened in the stretch. SEXY PROPOSAL stalked early, made a mild bid outside three to four wide on the turn then gave way in the
stretch. LAUGHING ROCKETT pressed the pace, was between rivals two to three wide on the turn and gave way in the stretch. SKY TWO NINE was
mid-pack early, began to drop back in the three to four path on the turn and faded. BIG OLD LONE STAR was in just a bit tight at the start, never was
involved racing in about the two to three path.

A CEE DOO CEE settled just off the fence and inside a foe early, dropped back and switched out about the half-mile marker, began to advance four then
five wide on the far turn, led past the furlong marker and drew clear. RIVER HEAD settled inside a foe off the pacesetter racing two to three deep, advanced
to take a narrow lead at the quarter pole still going two to three wide, was overtaken in upper stretch and no match but held second from DAJUDGE, who
raced outside RIVER HEAD three to four wide through all of the going, kept on but could not get second. G M GAGE settled outside a rival three wide early,
advanced some into upper stretch going three deep on the far turn but could not sustain the effort. IRON BRITCHES was urged forward at the break, set the
pace racing on or just off the rail, gave way. JEDI FEVER saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
MASTER RULER set a pressured pace from off the rail edging away in the two to three path on the turn and into upper stretch, kicked clear thereafter.
COWBOY TOBY was forced in just a touch at the start, pressed the pace from outside, went five to six wide on the turn, kept on to hold the place. YES
ITSA STAR was allowed to settle, shifted in about the three-eighths to be three wide entering the turn in behind the leaders, angled out seven deep leaving
that bend, got the nod for show. LAYCOCK BAY broke in just a bit, was a little rank in behind early, went four to five wide on the turn, steadied slightly in
upper stretch as a rival drifted out placing him in tight quarters, ran on and missed show honors. EMBELLISHING BOB was a bit slow into stride then
unhurried, saved ground on or just off the rail advancing inside a rival on the turn, came out four wide into upper stretch, shifted in about the sixteenth pole
for room and ran on mildly. DIABOLICAL KING chased from inside, saved ground, came out in the stretch and had no late kick. SHIO pressed from between
runners going four wide on the turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch under a left-handed whip, weakened. ANOTHER BROTHER was in just a bit tight at the
break, raced mostly in the four to six path and was not a threat. ZOMBIE ALAN was urged at the break but lacked speed, went in the three to four path on
the turn, tired.

Footnotes
THIRSTY MONKEY set a pressured pace racing in the three path through the first turn, moved nearer the inside going on or just off the rail on the far turn,
was headed at the quarter pole, looked beaten about the furlong marker but dug in to regain command late and prevail over S S DIAMOND, who stalked the
early leaders five wide, edged closer up the backstretch racing outside, moved in from four to two wide on the far turn putting a head in front, led past the
furlong marker but was outfinished. MS HIGHSPEED broke outwardly just a bit, settled well back in about the two path on both turns, advanced on the far
turn and was gaining in the stretch but too late. WISKEYS DREAMS was just a bit fractious in the gate, pressed the pace four wide and outside early, vied
between runners up the backstretch, dropped back three wide on the far turn, lugged out in mid-stretch while weakening. BATTLEFIELDMARSHAL was
lightly taken hold of at the break, moved out on the first turn going two then four wide on that bend, made an early advance past and outside rivals up the
backstretch, went four then three wide on the far turn and could not rally thereafter. PAIN FOR GAIN was forced out a bit at the start, trailed on the rail to the
first turn then moved out about three wide, continued nearer the rail throughout and improved position. K W JAZZN raced three wide and mid-pack into and
on the first turn, began to lose ground three then five wide on the far turn and was empty for the drive. REGOLA D'ORO saved ground on or just off the rail
before coming out four wide near the three-sixteenths, made no bid. GIVE IT AWAY had brief speed pressing inside on or just off the rail, shifted out leaving
the first turn, dropped back tired.

Footnotes
A GREAT VICE was bumped lightly at the break but quickly moved forward to contest the pace inside rivals just off the fence, continued on or just off the rail
edging away on the turn and cleared into upper stretch, held under a drive. JACK'S PARTY GIRL bumped a rival and steadied slightly at the start, settled off
the leaders, went in behind the top ones in the two but mostly three path on the turn, angled out turning for home and moved between foes five wide at the
furlong marker, gained the place. IMGOINOUTTONIGHT vied outside runners early, went four wide on the turn, captured show honors. DAWN TERA
contended between runners three wide on the turn and offered no extra in the lane. STEALING HOME saved ground to reach striking distance by upper
stretch but flattened out. YES I'M GOOD raced well off the inside in about the six path on the turn and was never near enough to threaten. BABY ROSE was
bumped at the break and urged along, went five wide on the turn and offered no bid. CAN'T GET AWAY bumped a rival and then steadied slightly at the
start, trailed in about the two path and was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
SAMURAI JACK tracked the early pace then moved through inside rivals but off the fence to take command into the turn, went in the two to three path on
that bend having edged clear, held under steady handling. TREBULSKI settled off the leaders, shifted in from a wide berth to about the two path entering
the turn, advanced leaving that bend then evened out in the lane. IMA REAL DEAL stalked from outside, went wide on the turn, missed the place. ALMOST
A STORM switched off the inside in the early going, trailed in the two to three path on the turn, swung out six wide and gained mildly. SEND THE STORM
attended the early pace from outside, lost ground five wide on the turn, failed to rally. INSOMNIA steadied slightly near the half-mile marker when in tight,
failed to threaten racing in the two path on the turn. MARTHAS BOY vied early inside a rival but well off the fence, went four wide on the turn and weakened.
JAZZ TOWN broke in the air and awkwardly, moved in and rushed up inside, tired. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

Footnotes
KRIS WHO was urged at the break, set the tempo from off the rail, went in the two path on the turn, drifted a bit in mid-stretch but dug in to hold sway.
SILENT ZENON stalked the aforementioned going three to four wide on the turn, could make no headway late. WISKEY CROWN tracked from inside,
switched out three wide coming past the quarter pole, lacked the needed late kick. A ZENON NITE shifted in and settled, went on then just off the rail
through the turn, moved between rivals in upper stretch and improved. FOUR STAR SAINT raced outside well back, traveled in the four path through the
turn, improved position in the lane. SILVER SECRET R F stalked from outside four then three deep on the turn, failed to rally. LESTER'S MEMORY shifted
in going in the two path into the turn and moving to the rail on that bend, came up empty.
