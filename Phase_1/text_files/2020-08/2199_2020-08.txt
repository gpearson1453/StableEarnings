Footnotes
DOCTOR ROBERT showed speed and set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was much the best.
SOUL N' SPIRIT stalked the leader from the inside, raced evenly on the far turn and held place. NU BABY DADDY was unhurried early, had a mild gain on
the far turn and from the six path through the stretch was up for show. GIANTBALLS OF FIRE tracked from the outside and was a factor on the far turn but
from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. SPARKISH was off the pace and saved ground on the far turn but was not a factor. TEXAS BOY
broke outward and trailed throughout in a dull effort.

slim lead on the turn but from the three path through the stretch was outfinished. LEWNSKYSWILDAFFAIR was in touch and hustled along on the turn but
from the three path through the stretch needed more. FLASH MAN was off slow, trailed the field on the turn and was never a threat. UKNOWULIKEIT forced
the pace and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left.

FABULOUS was in touch and a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. MUSICAL FLIGHT was
unhurried early and moved up on the turn but from the six path through the stretch leveled off. PRINCESSA FIONA was off the pace and saved ground on
the turn but needed more. TALKING LEAVES was in range and raced evenly on the turn but was no real threat. WELL YOU KNOW stalked the leader from
the inside but chased on the turn and flattened out through the stretch. SPEEDY RUNNER had no speed and showed little while outrun.

PRINCESS MORO had no speed, gained ground on the far turn and with a bid from the four path at the top of the stretch drew off. NO EXTENSIONS
showed speed from the inside and had the lead on the far turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and was second best. ONE FOR NICKI was off the
pace and roused on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. MOON ROVER forced the pace and was a factor on the far
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch flattened out. STORMY SUZIE was in touch early but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.
