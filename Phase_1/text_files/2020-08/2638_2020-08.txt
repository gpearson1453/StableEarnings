Footnotes
IT'S A MANS WORLD away alertly, matched strides along the inside for the early lead, shook clear on the turn then widened the balance of the trip to win
as much the best under a hand ride. BLISTERING PAKSHI never far back, had a mild late rally in the four path and finished clear for second. SUSIE'S KID
offered a mild bid in the three path into the stretch then leveled off. CHOCOLATE PHILLING failed to menace. QUALITY MAN battled with the winner early,
got out on the turn then gave way. TAPSHOT hopped and bobbled at the start then was no factor. EL MARRO broke through the gate prior to the start,
upon being reloaded, stalked the pace three wide into the turn then flattened out. GIFT OF OAK was outrun.

HADA MADRINA broke in front, set a pressured pace, drifted inward entering the turn bumping HAWT MESS then widened the balance of the trip to win as
much the best while taken in hand late. HAWT MESS pressured the winner to that one's inside down the backstretch, was bumped entering the turn causing
her rider to check hard then finished clear fro second. BELLA DUDETTE allowed to settle, rallied through the final furlong to get a minor part. J P'S GLADYS
well placed, lacked the needed response. HIDATSA PARK was never close. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW
DISQUALIFIED HADA MADRINA FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE TURN AND PLACED HER SECOND.

under brisk handling. SOLE FACTOR with the second flight near the inside, shifted out to the six path, rallied through the stretch and finished second best.
DYNA'S HOLIDAY close up from the start, loomed boldly three wide past the quarter pole then was outfinished. BEST OF YOU failed to menace.
PERSEVERING HONOR had good early speed then faded. WILD TILLIE had the early lead along the inside, was headed by the winner, chased that one

Footnotes
MACADOOOO KID stalked the leaders near the inside into the stretch, rallied in the two path to make the lead inside the furlong marker and won under
strong handling. SEASONS END allowed to settle, altered course from the five path to the rail inside the furlong marker and was steadily cutting into the
winners advantage late. BRILLIANTBENNY delayed the start while refusing to load, vied for the lead three wide, bid in upper stretch then was outfinished.
ADMIRAL GLEN away alertly, set a pressured pace two wide until mid stretch then was outfinished. PINOT ENVY hopped at the start, trailed and closed a
gap late outside. CLASSIC VOLUME failed to menace. CHILLINLIKAVILLIN pressed the pace along the rail into the turn then weakened. KISS ME
COWGIRL well placed, failed to respond. THE GOSPEL OF MARK had brief speed. MADDIE SON was outrun. HAPPY TAKEOVER was no factor.
