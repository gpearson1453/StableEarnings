SACATONE dueled inside a rival off the rail initially then nearer the rail on the turn, edged clear turning for home, drew off under vigorous hand urging.
KABULL dueled outside the winner early, went three wide on the turn, fought on to get the place over STACKING ROCKS, who lightly bumped a rival at the
start, chased from outside, went five then four wide on the turn, was outfinished for second. ELUSIVE ACCOUNTING settled off the leaders inside, swung
four deep turning for home, shifted in past mid-stretch and ran on. MORO MAN raced outside at the back, went in the three to four path on the turn and
failed to rally. RAIN MAGIC was urged along at the break, raced inside on or just off the rail and failed to threaten. F S GOLD was bumped at the break,
shifted in a bit heading into the turn going three wide on that bend, weakened.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN FIRE switched out in the early going, edged closer on the turn going five then four wide on that bend and challenging for the lead past the
quarter pole, dueled through the stretch and dug in determinedly to prevail over E BAR GOLD, who set the tempo from off the inside, led them into the turn
four deep moving in a path on that bend and challenged inside and out, dueled with the aforementioned through the lane but was only a game second.
MEGA SOURCE stalked from outside early, went five to six wide through the turn, kept on late for show honors. QUIEN ES broke outwardly just a tad and
was urged from the start, pressed the pace inside rivals but off the fence, had no extra in the drive. REBACK HOME was forwardly-positioned between
rivals early, dropped back three wide on the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. CHACHAS SPECIAL was in just a bit tight after the break, raced along the
rail before switching out at the seven-sixteenths as a rival came in, went in the two to three path on the turn and ran on mildly inside a foe late. CAGE
RATTLER was in just a bit tight after the break, shifted in late up the backstretch, saved ground but dropped back tired.

Footnotes
BUMBLEBEE attended the pace from outside, went four wide on the turn taking the lead past the three-sixteenths, drew off when roused in upper- to
mid-stretch. AIREDALE was bumped at the break, raced outside off the leaders, forced four to five wide on the turn, floated eight wide into upper stretch,
ran on to get up for second late over NO DOUBT, who was urged forward from the break, set the tempo while pressured from outside and racing off the rail,
moved nearer the rail into the turn going on or just off the fence through that bend, overtaken before the head of the stretch, lost place late while weakening.
INDIAN DRAGON contended between runners, entered the turn three wide, dropped back into upper stretch but kept on late to narrowly miss show honors.
NEXTPORTOFCALL chased in behind the leaders, went in the two to three path on the turn, swung out six deep into upper stretch and needed more to
threaten. DRINKIN FIRE WATER bumped the outside rival at the start, pursued the leaders between the second flight on the turn going three to four wide
on that bend before moving out seven deep turning into upper stretch, failed to rally. TIZ A SLAYER switched off the inside early, lacked speed despite
some encouragement, went in the three to four path on the turn and was not a threat. MALUSITA'S HOME was ridden along early, saved ground on the turn
before coming out to be in the two to three path in upper stretch, failed to menace.

Footnotes
TRIPLE ACCOUNT attended the early pace from inside, moved through to take the lead about the five-sixteenths, drew clear into upper stretch and held
safe but was shortening stride late. MS. LEA broke inwardly just a bit, was unhurried early racing well back, went just off the rail through the turn, angled out
five wide at the top of the stretch and was thereupon asked for run, gained the place but was too late to catch the winner. BOBBI BABY RUN broke slowly
and was then forced in at the start, pursued in behind rivals three wide into the turn, moved out five deep on that bend, got into second by upper- to
mid-stretch but lost place late. RAZORBACK HONEY was bumped into a rival at the start, pressed from outside going four wide on the turn then weakened.
RED RHUMBA bumped the inside rival at the start, shifted in up the backstretch, went two to four wide on the turn, failed to rally. LAURA BELLE set a
pressured pace off the rail, weakened. ICY CAPE angled in about the seven-sixteenths entered the turn on the rail but gradually fanned out seven deep by
late on that bend, was not a threat. TIZ MY HOUR broke inwardly, was in the back half of the field just off the fence into and on the turn, failed to threaten.
ELECTRICK COUNTY was rambunctious and hard to handle in the post parade, switched outside rivals about the seven-sixteenths, went five to six wide on
the turn and was not a factor. SASSY KITTY was bumped lightly at the break, showed brief speed from between rivals, dropped back and tired.
