drive. WELL CONNECTED set the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane and was no match for the winner in the stretch run. DARK OAK stalked
the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. WILD WES tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and
faded down the lane. BIGMANCAN bobbled at the start and trailed the field early on, was in the six path into the lane and improved position. SAMURAI
CAUSE was done early. WHEAT KING was never a threat.
