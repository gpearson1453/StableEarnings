Footnotes
SWEET AS CANBE broke sharply, was urged along prompting a rival's pace into the turn, took over nearing upper stretch, went well clear while lugging
inwards despite some correction to win under mild urging. MISS STEELE JONES settled outside foes in the opening stages, made steady progress three
wide on the turn into the lane and proved best of the others. CATSONG, urged to the lead along the inside racing through the backstretch, dueled for
command into the turn and gave way late. HOT BRANDI settled in the last flight while shifting off the inside racing to the turn but never gained contention.
HOT HABANERO tracked just off the first flight along the inside early and steadily faded racing into the turn.

Footnotes
APPLE DAPPLE was rated outside a rival tracking off the first flight to the backstretch, was fanned four wide midway through the backstretch, continued in
that path into the far turn while being prompted to advance, gained the advantage outside foes entering the lane and held DRESS SHOPPING to the end
under firm right handed encouragement. The latter bobbled slightly at the start, tracked just off the leaders along the inside in the opening half, briefly
awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then split rivals just off the inside to challenge inside the winner late while being just outkicked. BEACH
GETAWAY, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace, pressed the issue between foes into the far turn to upper stretch and weakened late. APPEALING
AUDREY was settled outside foes in the last flight, was prompted to advance while caught five wide on the far turn into upper stretch and gained some
position while making no real impression. STORMY MUSIC, firmly rated inside foes in the last flight racing to the first turn, switched out gaining position
three deep between foes entering the backstretch to press the issue in that path racing into the far turn and gave way abruptly into the lane. SUPERSTAR
BEA settled between foes in the last flight early, angled to the inside on the far turn but offered no rally. DICEY, urged to the lead along the rail, dueled for
command into the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
PAPA'S ISLA DOLL broke readily, was urged to prompt a rival's pace through the backstretch, took over racing into the turn, forged clear nearing the lane
racing well off the inside and widened the advantage under firm encouragement. ORTS DREAM settled last while angling to the rail, saved ground on the
turn gaining position inside foes, then switched off the inside late to prevail for the place honors from between foes. TEMUJIN LADY broke outwards
bumping A ROZE AND WINE, was righted to track off the first flight inside rivals, shifted out three wide on the turn while being urged in pursuit of the leader
but lacked the needed final kick. HADDY UP broke inwards bumping A ROZE AND WINE, was righted, then urged to the lead angling to the inside disputing
the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn and gave way nearing the lane. BINDING TIME tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight and
came up empty nearing the lane. A ROZE AND WINE, bumped, then squeezed between rivals at the start, recovered to track off the first flight between foes
but faded early.

Footnotes
SOMTHINGSCANDALOUS, firmly rated inside rivals racing behind the second flight into the backstretch, steadily gained position to race just off the leaders
nearing the second bend while continuing under light reserve, awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, shifted out advancing through tight quarters to bid
for command inside the leader entering the lane and narrowly prevailed in time under firm encouragement. DO YOU BILEVE tracked just off the first flight
along the inside in the opening half, shifted out three wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, took over in that path racing into upper
stretch, drifted out resisting the winner's challenge to the end but just failed to contain that foe. GOLDEN LILY settled in the last flight while angling inside
racing to the backstretch, swung out six wide entering the lane, then shifted in late while finishing willingly to gain position to the end. TURQUOISE TRAIL
ducked in at the start, bumping KARMA REIGNS, was righted to gain a forward placing three wide in the opening stages tracking just off the first flight,
conceded some position on the backstretch, raced four wide into the second bend, drifted to the five path midway through that bend and continued wide to
the lane while lacking the needed final kick. SPITFIRE SUZIE, in touch attending a rival's pace under light rating in the opening half, pressed the pace
between foes racing into the far turn and gave way into the lane. BAILDON was rated between foes in second flight but dropped back early and offered no
rally. SKIPTEASE, off slowly, raced three, then four wide on the first turn, was caught wide through the backstretch and never gained contention. KARMA
REIGNS, bumped at the break, was shuffled back last, drifted wide into the first turn and never menaced thereafter. FAIRY SURPRISE, urged to the lead
along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin, dueled for command into the far turn and gave way nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
FORMIDABLE FORCE, off last, angled to the inside racing as part of the last flight to the backstretch, steadily gathered momentum splitting rivals racing
into the far turn, shifted three deep nearing upper stretch gaining striking distance, was carried out racing through the stretch but prevailed under brisk left
handed pressure. STARRING JOHN WAIN tracked just off the leaders along the inside in the opening half, switched off the inside racing through the far turn
advancing to challenge, gained the advantage racing into upper stretch, drifted wide resisting the winner's bid but couldn't contain that rival. ALOO GHOST
was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, gradually gathered momentum while angling out four wide racing into the lane and edged
a rival for a share. VIX VISION tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, angled in racing into the far turn continuing in pursuit of the
leaders but lacked the needed closing bid. BEVOLUTION, urged inside a rival disputing the pace into the backstretch, dispatched that foe entering the far
turn, briefly disputed the issue inside the top pair and gave way nearing midstretch. HERO OF FIRE settled between foes in the last flight early and never
mounted a serious challenge. TENACIOUS MOON, urged forcing the pace outside a rival to the backstretch, gave way racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
BEYOND STREETSMART broke readily, tracked off the first flight outside foes, steadily advanced on the leaders shifting four wide nearing upper stretch
and wore down SNOOSE GOOSE in the closing stages to prevail in time under firm left handed pressure. The latter was urged between foes disputing the
pace, then inside foes into the turn, dispatched a challenge while shifting off the inside entering the lane, resisted the winner's challenge to late stages but
came up second best. DAZZL'N MISCHIEF, urged prompting the pace nearest the inside in early stages, tracked off the first flight along the rail into the turn,
came through inside foes to bid along the rail in the lane and prevailed for a share. NO MO HOOCH angled inwards, pressed the pace outside a rival into
the turn, then gave way in the drive. FRONT OFFICE tracked off the second flight three wide, angled to the rail entering the turn and continued to improve
position to the end. COASTLINE SERMON, held up last along the inside in the opening stages, never gained contention. MOMENT OF MAGIC, caught in
tight quarters in the opening stages, steadied out of tight quarters after the opening furlong, swung out racing into the lane but had no rally. MORE THAN A.
P. tracked the pace between foes in second flight and emptied out racing into the turn.

four wide in second flight racing into the turn and continued evenly late. SAM'S PALACE tracked off the second flight on the backstretch, then continued five
wide into the lane but offered no rally. MATT AND CHEESE angled to the inside early dropping off the second flight but never gained contention. MY EASY

Footnotes
SAMURAI MIKE angled to the rail in early stages tracking off the first flight into the turn, switched out nearing upper stretch to bid five wide racing into the
lane and produced a solid closing response to wrest command and kick clear under strong handling. BIG SPORT angled to the inside tracking off the
second flight from well out of striking distance racing to the turn, shifted out nearing the lane, then angled back to the rail nearing midstretch but continued
with a steady bid to prevail for second. BURGAMEISTER, reserved outside foes racing to the turn, angled six wide entering the lane and found his best
stride late to just miss for second. GIANT GAMBLE was hustled up the rail disputing the pace into the turn, edged forward racing into the lane but emptied
out leaving midstretch. SERENGETI CAT, urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way in late stages. THIRTY SECONDS
OUT settled off the second flight outside foes in early stages, shifted four wide racing into the lane but made no real impression. ROYAL PRIVACY, held up
avoiding close quarters at the start, raced along the inside but never gained contention. SEANSHINE tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight,
shifted in on the turn, was urged to split foes three wide bidding for command in upper stretch but quickly flattened out. SAVED BY ZERO joined the pace
three wide in the opening stages, pressed the pace into the turn and gave way racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
DEVIL VISION, forwardly placed stalking a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, conceded some position to the leader on the backstretch, was prompted to
close the gap on the far turn, pressed the issue into upper stretch and edged clear late under pressure. MACHO RAPIDO angled inside tracking off the first
flight, came under pressure to advance racing into the far turn, shifted out three wide entering the lane and continued with interest to gain the place honors
late. AND HE'S LOOSE, urged to the lead along the rail racing to the first turn, went well clear racing to the far turn, briefly resisted the winner's bid but gave
out racing into the lane. FLASH FLOOD, climbing a bit between foes tracking off the first flight early, angled inside racing into the far turn but offered no rally.
SAN VALENTINO, off last, was settled outside foes and never seriously menaced. BUBBA BOB, urged to a forward placing three wide racing to the first
turn, dropped out early.
