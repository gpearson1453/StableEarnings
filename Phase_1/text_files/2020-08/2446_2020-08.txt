GYPSY KING set the pace from the outset, was on the inside into the lane while clearing the field with ease then continued on down the lane while
unchallenged and under a hand ride. KING'S MISCHIEF came in at the start, chased the pace early, was in the six path into the lane, no match for the
winner but was second best. THROWN FOR A LOUPE hopped at the start, stalked the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane and no match for the top
two in the stretch run. MAKAI was bothered at the start, chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and weakened in the stretch drive.
PRETTY BOY ELM broke in at the start, tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, in tight in the stretch and faded late in the drive. HARD
KNOCKING was never a threat. TWILIGHT BLUE was done early. THING was through early. BIG BLUE was bumped at the start and no factor.

Footnotes
DOUBLE OAKED rallied from far off of the pace in the four path around the far turn before circling five wide turning for home with many lengths to find, then
sustained her surge through the late stages to drive past the leader inside the final sixteenth, and won going away. SILENT SURPRISE advanced from
midpack two wide around the far turn to split the leaders three wide passing the quarter pole, drew off approaching the furlong pole, but was run down in the
final sixteenth. HER GIANT saved ground far off of the pace, improved turning for home, and sustained a mild rail rally for show. PRINCESS PHONE
pressed the pace two wide and between horses, vied down the backstretch, forged a narrow lead passing the five sixteenths pole, but was no match for an
oncharging rival turning for home, and faltered. MY MAIKO saved ground and advanced from midpack around the far turn, but found traffic behind the
leaders at the quarter pole, shifted gradually to the four path through upper stretch, but lacked a kick. MISS COMMISH took up at the start, raced far off of
the pace in the two to three path, but was no factor. APRIL ENTRY pressed the pace three wide, but was outmoved by an inner foe-splitting rival turning for
home, and weakened. DIVINE DHARMA tracked from midpack in the four to two path around the first turn, but weakened into the far turn and was done
early. LADY JENNEVIERE set a pressured pace inside a pair of foes, lost the lead passing the five sixteenths pole, and weakened in upper stretch.
