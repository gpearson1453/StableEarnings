CASH ON FIRE was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide at the quarter pole, angled to the inside through the stretch and got up late under strong
encouragement. SWEET LINDA stalked the pace from the outside, raced in the five path through the stretch, led late but couldn't hold off the winner late to
finish second best. UPTOWNBLINGITHOME pressed the early pace, raced four deep through the stretch and kept on to the wire. MAGICAL ICE was slow
early, moved up six wide at the eighth pole and made a good belated rally. GIDGET stalked the pace, raced along the inside around the far turn through the
stretch and had no final winning bid. CLASSY BLING settled off the early pace, raced five wide past the eighth pole and had not enough. GEH
MYTHICALQUEEN dropped back early and failed to have a response. DAVID'S DREAM GIRL stalked the early pace, raced towards the inside and had no
response. WANNA BE IRISH was slow early and never threatened. IN DISGUISE raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. MY
