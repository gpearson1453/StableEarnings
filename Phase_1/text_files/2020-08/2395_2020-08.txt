Footnotes
GIZMO JONES allowed to settle, shifted out to the eight path entering the stretch, angled inside the runner up, dug in determinedly under stiff right handed
urging and was up in time while fully extended. LAST DROP OF WINE stalked the pace for six furlongs, swung out to the middle of the racetrack when
struck with a left handed whip entering the stretch, made the lead then couldn't handle the winner in the final strides. VISUAL MISSION well placed, went
evenly. SPEEDY MOBILE pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead, set the pace into the stretch then came up empty. TEAM HUCKY
moved up four wide on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. PAT'S KARMA away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside for a little over five
furlongs, had speed into the stretch and weakened late. O'MALLEY'S MARCH was no threat. MANGA MAN was no factor. GUCCISSIMO trailed.

Footnotes
S S REVOLUTIONARY never far back, surged through deep stretch three wide under right handed urging, made the lead in the final stages and drew clear.
INDELIBLE IMAGE settled mid pack, entering the stretch in the four path, altered course to the rail a sixteenth out, dug in determinedly and got up for
second. SHEZ SHACKED UP sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. RAINBOW SHIP chased the
pace and went evenly. SCARLETT'S AWISH was bumped then squeezed back shortly after the start then failed to menace. MINE ALONE well placed,
failed to respond. AUGMENTING ASSETS was no threat. MOMA GIRL bumped at the start and was no factor. CARMEN OHIO was pinched back soon
after the start then outrun. MILWAUKEE CAT ran off in the post parade, stumbled out of the gate in front then dropped back readily and was never close.
