Footnotes
STAYTHIRSTYMYAMIGO settled well, was angled in for the stretch, found a seam and rallied along the rail under solid handling. MISS PHOTO chased
while three wide, advanced on the turn, lodged a four wide bid, led late but was caught. KALLISTE ROSE outrun early, was swung five wide into the stretch
and showed good late energy. STAR HUNTER passed tired ones. LOUISE THE LASER chased while three wide, surged up on turn and came up empty in
the stretch. PUT SARAH ON never menaced. SHE'S SO BOSSY raced in striking position, gained a narrow lead on the turn and faded. SHADY LANE led
early and retreated.
