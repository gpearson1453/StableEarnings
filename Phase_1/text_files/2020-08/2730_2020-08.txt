again to be clear for second. SOUTHERN SPIRIT broke in front then drifting inward, set the pace with a clear lead, widened on the stretch, drifted out a bit

sustain that bid. WAR AT SUNRISE passed tiring rivals. I AM IRON MAN was no threat. EMPTY PRIZE failed to menace. SUPER FLEET had brief speed.

DANZIG RAINBOW allowed to settle, responded readily when set down, closed fast under right handed urging through the stretch, made the lead late and
drew off. PINK PAJAMAS broke in front, prompted the pace two wide, made the lead in the four path at the top of the stretch, maintained control until deep
stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. FAITH FACTOR trailed into the stretch then found her best stride late in the five path. LORETTAS
SONG stalked the pace along the rail, bid into the stretch then was outfinished. I FLY FIRST CLASS moved up three wide in the five path midway on the
turn then came up empty. PROUD MAID MARIAN had speed into the turn then faded. VAPNYARKA made the lead before a quarter, set a pressured pace
to the top of the stretch then flattened out.

KHALFANI chased the pace into the stretch, inherited the lead a sixteenth out and finished full of run under a strong hand ride to win going away. STORM
PEAK hit the gate and bumped with TIZAGHERA at the start, closed determinedly in the three path through the stretch and finished second best. OFF THE
MARK sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then tired. IDOWHATIDO inside, failed to respond. JOE CAIN failed to
menace. SANDLOT SAM was no factor. TIZAGHERA was bumped at the start then trailed.

LAST DROP OF WINE made the lead soon after the start, set the pace off the rail while getting slow fractions, was headed midway on the far turn, came on
again despite drifting out to the seven path in the stretch and proved best under right handed urging in a game effort. MOBIL SOLUTION bobbled out of the
gate in front, pressured the winner along the inside, gained a narrow lead along the rail on the far turn, drifted to the five path in the stretch and finished
second best. VISUAL MISSION saved ground and finished with good courage. AUTHENTIC COWTOWN stalked the pace from the four path and went
evenly. SAMMY DA BULL failed to menace. MANGA MAN was no factor. OAKS HONEY was outrun.

Footnotes
IMPRESSION GIVEN chased the leader into the turn, inherited the lead two wide when that one stopped, widened into the stretch and won as much the
best. HALIE'S ARCH inside, angled out on the turn, moved up in the five path and finished clear for second. BIONDETTA went evenly in the six path. LET'S
GO LUNA passed tiring rivals. WAR CAT was no threat. SAMTASTIK was no factor. CINS BOSS had speed three wide into the turn then gave way. PABLO
CREEK was outrun. LOVELY LEE got out and was never close. PRINCESS MAGDALENA sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace into
the turn, stopped abruptly and was eased to the wire.
