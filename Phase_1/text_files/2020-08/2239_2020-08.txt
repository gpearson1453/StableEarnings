Footnotes
HILL VALLEY was well placed outside, rallied the three path to command just before a half, drew out entering the stretch, remained clear into late stretch
and lasted. IL MIO AMORE raced inside the winner while between rivals early, dropped to the rail entering the turn, came out for the drive and slowly closed
a gap through late stretch. YELLOW CHICK was close up along the inside to the turn, came out into the three path then flattened out in the lane. UNCANNY
opened a clear lead before going a furlong, stayed out from the rail while in control for less than a half and had nothing left for the drive.

Footnotes
KISS MY NOTE was rated inside early, moved two wide to a short lead nearing the stretch then drew out in midstretch. ARGENTIC (FR) wasn't far back
early along the rail, came out into the three path on the final turn with a mild run but couldn't gain through the lane. TACHYON broke very slowly, was
content to lag early, began a three wide run into the far turn then gained through the lane while ducking in and out from the whip. HEIKO opened a clear
lead before going a furlong, angled to the inside, showed the way into the stretch then tired. VEYA angled to the rail on the backstretch and lacked a closing
response. CANDYCREET was inside early, steadied behind horses nearing the end of the backstretch then failed to menace. ESKENFORTIME was
unhurried three wide around the first turn, advanced outside on the backstretch then tired. SWINGING STAR tired between horses while outrun.
CHAMPAGNE CHUCK stayed close for about a half, stopped and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
LIME HOUSE LOUIE was caught in tight between horses nearing the end of the backstretch, angled outside, rallied the three path around the turn, closed
outside through the lane and was up late. BOAT'S A ROCKIN advanced outside early, improved position in the three path around the turn, moved closer in
early stretch, loomed boldly inside the winner in deep stretch but was outfinished. RAPID BEAT stayed out from the rail while in control and gave way
through deep stretch. OUR PHILLY SPECIAL chased along the inside and lacked the needed closing response. CALAMITY KAT was rank in the early
going, was bumped three wide midway on the turn, swung wide into the stretch and gained too late. FEDERAL DOMINANCE came in on MORGAN S.
leaving the gate and again soon after, improved position in the three path around the turn and gained late. MORGAN S. was bumped leaving the gate and
again soon after, stayed inside around the turn, came out between horses in early stretch and gained some ground. IM FOREVERYOUNG ducked in while
hard ridden from, the gate, was forced in midway on the backstretch then stopped inside. RIO ABAJO stopped two wide.

SWITCHRATTLENROLL was rated early, moved to vie three wide on the final turn, dueled through the lane and prevailed. MOUSE CAT dueled along the
rail from the outset, moved clear into the far turn, responded gamely when challenged in the lane, gave way grudgingly and returned with the saddle slipped
back. OFFERYOUCANTREFUSE was unhurried, made a run along the rail around the final turn and lacked a strong closing. WISFULL DRINKING passed
tired ones while outrun. LUXURY ITEM dueled to the far turn, stopped and was eased up. COSMOHEART ran out into the first turn, stayed close for about a
half then stopped.
