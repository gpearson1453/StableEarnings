Footnotes
HENRY RULES stalked in the five path, angled in at the seven-sixteenths pole, bothering a foe, saved ground, bid in early stretch and was up in time.
ROCKIN ALL NIGHT stalked the pace in the three path, clipped heels when a foe came over entering the turn, rallied late outside and missed.
KINGOFTHERAINBOW led inside before yielding late. VOLACIOUS rallied belatedly inside. INDY REBEL steadied at the eighth pole, then rallied late
between foes. PARKER raced evenly. CAN'T SAY ELLY MAE saved ground to no avail. JOE COOL pressed outside of the leader, then gave way.
BENNY'S LEGACY stalked outside and then faded in the stretch. HE'S NAUGHTY appeared to clip heels at the start. RED PROMISE was not a factor.
FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF ROCKIN ALL NIGHT, HENRY RULES WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND FOR
INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE TURN. THE STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION ON AN INQUIRY INVOLVING INDY REBEL IN THE STRETCH.

THATSWHATITHOUGHT dueled for the lead outside of a pair of foes early on, drew clear from those rivals into the turn, then widened his advantage
through the lane under confident handling. CUZI'MHAPPY dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes down the backstretch, but proved no match for his
outer counterpart into the turn, then held place through the lane. A LITTLE IRRADIC was jostled a bit between horses early on, raced off of the pace in the
four path around the turn, then stayed on for a minor share. GOOD SUGAR was forwardly placed two wide, but failed to menace. ALWAYSBEHUMBLE
took bumps on both sides at the start, lied close to the dueling leaders along the inside, but failed to keep pace with those foes around the turn, then passed
a tired foe in the late stages without making an impact. DONT ASK KINMON broke inwards and bumped a foe at the start, then failed to factor. TUFFER
THAN TUFF dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but was no match for his outer foe into the turn, then stopped late. EXPRESSED and
RUSTPROOF were never involved.

Footnotes
UNMOORED dueled for the lead outside of FAREEQ, put away that foe turning for home, and drew off under driving pressure through the final furlong.
FAREEQ dueled for the lead inside of UNMOORED, but failed to keep pace with that foe passing the quarter pole, then stayed clear of show through the
lane to prove second best. BETTER WATCH OUT raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, split foes two wide turning for home, forged show
between rivals in upper stretch, then held position without threatening place. LAND BATTLE trailed the field through the turn before swinging to the six path
turning for home, then rallied willingly for a minor reward. TOHUI stumbled at the start, then saved ground while racing off of the pace, and failed to get
involved. MR MANNING chased the pace in the three path, but failed to produce a bid, and weakened. DISTANT SHORE stalked the pace in the four path,
but failed to produce a bid, and weakened. BETTER CHARGE IT raced off of the pace three wide while caught in the five path around the turn, and failed to
make an impact.

Footnotes
FLOWERPECKER tracked the pace three wide from the four path, came into the lane three wide in range of the leaders, rallied to produce a bid at the
sixteenth pole, and prevailed in final stages. SACRED KIKI BIRD dueled for the lead two wide, edged an advantage turning for home and was clear
approaching the furlong pole, but was worn down by an outer foe in the final sixteenth. BANDIDO DE AMORES raced far off of the pace three to two wide,
split foes three wide passing the furlong pole to edge show, and was gaining on the leaders with a grinding advance late. COMFORT ME NOW trailed early
on, advanced four wide turning for home, then sustained his grinding advance to close the gap on the leaders, but was outfinished by an inner foe for show.
CLOSE THE CASE tracked the pace two wide and between horses, but failed to produce a bid and weakened. MEROCKETMAN raced off of the pace two
wide, cut the corner turning for home, but failed to make an impact. MUSIC TO MY EARS was forwardly placed inside a pair of foes while a bit off of the rail,
but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER was pinched back at the start, then came under coaxing to advance to midpack
along the inside of foes, but was done early. INSTANT WAR came out at the start, then dueled for the lead inside of a rival, but failed to keep pace with that
rival turning for home, then wilted through the lane. Due to a timer malfunction, the internal fractions were omitted and the final time was hand-timed.

Footnotes
NEVER FORGET prompted the pace two wide around the first turn before clearing her inner foe passing the five furlong pole, opened up down the
backstretch before getting a bit of a breather around the far turn, then widened again under confident handling turning for home, and won without ever being
asked for her best effort. KINDA LUCKY broke outwards and bothered MOMOS HUMOR at the start, set the pace along the inside into the first turn while
being hounded by NEVER FORGET, allowed that foe to clear off passing the five furlong pole, stalked before shifting two wide to chase that rival around the
far turn, slightly reduced the margin around that bend, but flattened out turning for home, and proved second best. MOMOS HUMOR was crowded between
horses at the start, raced off of the pace two wide while in the three path, and failed to menace. PEEK A BOO I SEE U stalked along the inside, saved
ground around both turns, but to no avail. DEMORA was bumped by an inner foe at the start, and trailed throughout.
