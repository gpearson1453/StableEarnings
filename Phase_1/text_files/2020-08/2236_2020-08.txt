Footnotes
CHICORY BLUE up close early from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch along the rail, reached a forward position entering the second turn,
responded when asked, gained the margin at the eighth pole and was well clear under steady urging. SECOND GUESS stalked the early pace outside,
crept closer entering the second turn, responded to pressure and close well late for the place. CLEVER LAD broke sharp from the outside, quickly gained
the early advantage, remained clear up the backstretch, held a forward position for the drive but could not keep pace. GOBLER unhurried early from the
outside, advanced through the second turn, responded but was too late. MESETA DIABLO could only pass tired ones. RED BIRD PLACE up close early
from the outside, came up empty in the drive. GRAY PHANTOM was no factor. ITS A CITY DAY was no threat. WHATHADHAPPENWUZ had a steady
fade.

Footnotes
TWO DATE stalked the early pace from the outside, dueled up the backstretch, remained engaged entering the second turn, gained a short advantage
entering the drive, drifted in mid stretch and was just up the final yards. COGAN dueled from the outside early, battled up the backstretch, remained
engaged entering the drive, was steadied at the eighth pole when in tight and was outfinished in a game effort. HUMPHREY well placed from the inside,
steadily advanced up the rail, reached a striking position entering the second turn, lacked room entering the drive, responded when asked but was too late.
EXPECT ICE was no real factor. GUITAR KING dueled from the inside and faded. SAVED AT SEA was always outrun. One mile split time unavailable due
to a timer malfunction

SAY WHEN broke sharp from the outside, quickly gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the
second turn, widen the effort at the eighth pole and was well clear in a gate to wire effort. MAYBERRY SALOON chased the early pace outside, remained in
a forward position for the drive but was no match while clearly second best. MAYAN GHOST forced the early pace inside, remained forward but could only
hold position. WILDFIRE STORM went evenly. ZARAZI was no factor. BAYANDBUNNY was always outrun.
