Footnotes
DUBROVSKY trailed early, advanced inside, angled out into the stretch, split foes, and drew away in the final furlong. KINGSVILLE stalked the dueling
pacesetters inside, moved out in the stretch rallying but was no match. SYNERGIZED prompted the leader outside to the stretch then came again for the
show. MASS APPEAL hustled to the front inside, led to the stretch and gave way. SURFER BOY GEORGE chased wide off the pace and was finished on
the final turn. PROUD AND FURIOUS dropped back early, raced wide and was never in contention. CURLIN'S KNIGHT settled outside the leaders and
faded after half a mile.

GUNFIGHTER'S GIRL broke slowly, raced very wide, took the lead leaving furlong grounds and edged clear. MISS ANTONELLA dueled between foes, fell
back on the turn, drifted out through stretch and offered some late run. MIGHTY ELECTRICA, bumped leaving the gate, raced inside winner early, took the
lead near mid stretch but then fell back. CATCH A PEEP raced wide and wasn't a serious threat. AMERICAN MONEY reared in the post parade unseating
her rider, set the pace inside then tired. ALL RIGHT GIRL failed to menace. LA BELLA CHICA stumbled leaving the gate then came out and bumped
MIGHTY ELECTRICA..

CREATIVE GENIUS set a pressured pace inside, bid clear on the final turn, repelled a challenge and pulled away again. ECLIPSED MOON settled far
behind inside, rallied along the rail to the stretch, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. IMPERIAL BREW dropped back early inside then passed
foes while no threat. JONES TAXI lagged far behind, moved very wide passing tiring rivals. MANIPULATE put to the whip early, was taken up between foes
into the first turn, raced wide and retreated. VOCAB hustled close up briefly then chased inside. DON POLO alternated for the lead outside and stopped
after half a mile.

Footnotes
CREATIVE PRINCESS set the pace in the four path, gradually moved to rail, held a clear lead mid stretch and held on. SWEET BLAME was somewhat
unsettled in the starting gate and bore out after the start, moved to the rail on the final turn, challenged mid stretch but failed to sustain her bid. THEODOSIA
saved ground just off the pace, moved out and held on gamely. MIDNIGHT BOUNTY saved ground to the stretch, eased out slightly and finished well. MIJA
BELLA broke slowly, was wide and no factor. FIDUCIARY VALUES, three wide in second flight, tired. SLINGIN SAMMY B, between second flight, had little
left.

SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS dueled along the inside then edged away in the final furlong while kept to his task. BAPTIZE THE BOY unruly loading, prompted the
leaders three wide and continued willingly. HE IZ GONE chased in the two path on the turn, angled wide and closed well too late. TALLY MO pressed the
winner to the eighth pole and weakened. GILDED WARRIOR trailed down the backstretch under the whip and was no factor. SMART AND TOUGH angled
inside on the turn and weakened steadily.

FRAN'S WORRIER dueled three wide light rating, quickly drew off under strong urging and continued to widen while fully extended. BROTHER TEZ raced
wide while not far back and was along for place. TOMMY'S TOP CAT saved ground disputing the pace then faded through the stretch. MANTLE broke in a
tangle, was under steady pressure early, raced very wide and was no factor. CATCH FIRE, in the four path and just off the pace, tired. FLATEXCEL dueled
for command between foes then tired. FOREST RIVER was bumped soundly leaving the gate and raced wide. KRAKOV saved ground and never
threatened. SMOOTH DON B was wide and was never a factor.
