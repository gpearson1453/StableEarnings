Footnotes
LILLET was bumped by I DON'T WANT TO GO in the opening strides, settled in second last down the backstretch, improved in the two path from past the
seven sixteenths, rallied two wide, came into the lane between horses, was driven up the rail in the stretch and responded with a smooth rally, rolled up
inside of FOGGY FLIGHT, led past the furlong pole, and cleared. FOGGY FLIGHT was sent to press the pace outside of RELEASE THE HEAT, dueled
outside of that foe while racing in the four path on the turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, was driven into the lane, was headed by LILLET to her inside
past the eighth pole, kept on under a drive to the sixteenth pole, and was ridden out the rest of the way to prove a clear second best. EYE ON THE FINISH
chased midpack, saved ground through the turn and into the lane, and kept on while proving no match for the top two. I DON'T WANT TO GO broke inward
and bumped LILLET in the opening strides, tracked well off the leading pair down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, went to a drive near the
five sixteenths, came three wide into the lane and flattened. GODSGIFT took up in the opening strides after I DON'T WANT TO GO bumped LILLET into her
path, settled at the rear, trailed in the three to four path on the turn, came into the lane under a drive in the five path, and had no bid. RELEASE THE HEAT
was hustled for early speed, set a pressured pace down the backstretch, dueled inside of FOGGY FLIGHT in the three path on the turn, emptied out from
the quarter, had no response when driven in upper stretch, was not persisted with inside the eighth pole and drifted out as he faded.

Footnotes
MOJO MAN chased the front runners between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, split horses entering the stretch, ranged up
outside the leader, took command at the eighth pole and drew clear from there. STRONG WILL stumbled slightly and bumped with the horse to his outside
leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, took command while saving ground headed into the turn, relinquished the
lead to the eventual winner passing the eighth pole and chased that one home, the best of the rest. IMPRESSED hit the gate at the break, trailed the field
on the outside in the early going, began a bid from the three path midway around the turn, entered the stretch from the four path and was outkicked from
there. NUCLEAR OPTION dueled for the lead on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, settled in behind the leader around the turn, entered the
stretch from the two path and flattened out in the final furlong. STAR OF KODIAK brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced on the inside
towards the back of the pack early, saved ground around the turn and offered no bid in the stretch.

CAN'T SAY NO raced at the rear outside early, advanced on the outer past the five eighths, loomed three wide through the turn, led approaching the quarter
pole, drove clear from the three sixteenths, and kept on well clear. LOST IN MANHATTAN settled two wide at the rear of a compact field, was pushed along
toward the rear in the five path on the turn, bid four wide approaching the quarter pole, sustained his rally under a drive into the lane but proved no match for
the winner. RIO SECO settled at the inside toward the rear of a compact field, continued at the rear in the three path on the turn, swung out in the six to
seven path into the lane, rallied four wide in upper stretch, dropped inside of LOST IN MANHATTAN approaching midstretch, kept on but was outfinished.
DEMAND RANSOM was hustled for pace early but outsprinted to the lead, tracked the leading pair instead on the backstretch, continued to track the
leading trio in the two path on the turn, floated into the lane in the five path but had no kick. CLUB SODA was hustled between horses to duel inside of
KNOCKYOURBLOCKOFF on the turn, began to flatten past the five sixteenths, came into the lane under a drive inside, but proved empty.
KNOCKYOURBLOCKOFF was sent for pace and dueled outside of CLUB SODA, stayed on the lead slightly longer than that foe but was headed by CAN'T

NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) led throughout, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was kept to the task to the wire to win
under a drive. COUSIN DARIO raced inside in the middle of the pack early, saved ground around the turn, and chased the winner home, to just hold on for
the place. WAKE UP JOE hopped up leaving the gate, raced inside up the backstretch, improved position from the rail on the turn, angled out to enter the
stretch from the two path, and gained ground in late stretch to just miss the place. NOMO RON brushed with the horse to his inside at the break, raced
outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path, and passed tiring horses in the stretch. PABLO DEL MONTE stalked the
leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and faded entering the stretch. BOSTON CHARLEY brushed with the
horse to his outside leaving the gate, chased the frontrunner on the outside early, came around the turn in the two path and tired in the stretch. DURANGO
KID was pinched back leaving the gate, trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the two path around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
GRAND HIDEAWAY came out in the opening strides, settled at the rear, was shaken up near the seven sixteenths and made a smooth advance up the
inside, switched out into the lane, sustained his rally three wide into the lane, felt two taps of the crop near the furlong pole and took the lead approaching
that mark, opened up, felt the crop only once more near the sixteenth and continued to draw off the rest of the way. IRISH LIGHTED ROAD bobbled at the
start but nonetheless soon led, saved ground through the turn while pressured by KING RICHIE, shook that foe off past the quarter pole, led until he was
headed by GRAND HIDEAWAY in the shadow of the furlong pole, and kept on under a drive while no match for the winner. SKEETERSKEETS broke out
and bumped CAPTAIN CARNEGIE in the opening strides, chased well off the leading pair down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, came
under a drive into the lane, and chased on outside without finding enough to get up for second. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE was bumped by SKEETERSKEETS
in the opening strides, chased outside that foe down the backstretch, chased at the rear in the four path to the apex of the turn, dropped closer to the inside
near the five sixteenths, continued under a drive toward the inside down the lane but lacked the needed bid. KING RICHIE was asked for speed, pressed
outside of IRISH LIGHTED ROAD down the backstretch and around the turn, came into the lane under a drive but emptied out and faded under continued
urging down the lane.

kicked clear in upper stretch and increased his lead to the wire. RAG TAG saved ground around the first turn, raced on the inside in the middle of the pack

stretch and gained ground late on the outside. HILLBILLY DELUXE chased the leader on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued
around the far turn in the two path, drifted in mildly near the eighth pole and weakened in the stretch. HUEY ATTACK raced in the three path around the first

Footnotes
CROW MOON was grazed by ECRU in the opening strides but nonetheless soon led, took pressure from CAUSE FOR PARDON to his outside down the
backstretch and through the far turn, but kicked away into the lane and kept on well clear while kept to the task. CAUSE FOR PARDON raced keenly early
on the inside, tracked the pacesetter inside of DONIVAN MY BOY through the first turn, switched out to press outside of CROW MOON down the
backstretch and through the far turn, proved no match into the lane, but saved the place. URBAN LIGHT (IRE) was bumped by BEAR TRAPPE in the
opening strides, settled near the rear through the first turn, kept on two wide down the backstretch, rallied three wide on the far turn, continued three wide
into the lane, and chased on with continued interest in the lane without finding enough to get up for the place. LOVE YOUR BUTTONS raced two wide in the
rear pair into the first turn, continued in second last down the backstretch, kept on toward the rear in the four to five path on the far turn, and passed tired
horses in the lane. ECRU broke out and grazed CROW MOON in the opening strides, chased inside of GOOD INTENT through the first turn, continued
midfield inside of URBAN LIGHT down the backstretch, bid tween horses into the far turn, but evened out past the five sixteenths. GOOD INTENT chased
two wide around the clubhouse turn, advanced on the backstretch to track the leading pair inside of DONIVAN MY BOY, lost ground along the inside into
the far turn, and was no further factor in the lane. BEAR TRAPPE broke out and bumped URBAN LIGHT in the opening strides, settled at the rear,
continued to trail in the two to three path on the far turn, and had no bid in the lane. DONIVAN MY BOY tracked the pace two wide through the clubhouse
turn and down the backstretch, raced three wide into the far turn but soon dropped to the inside, continued to track the leading pair in the two path on that
bend, but faded inside horses in the lane.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE FORCE led the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and maintained his margin under a drive.
TWO PAIR pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, chased the winner home and just held the place.
DUMBMARK hopped up leaving the gate, raced off the pace up the backstretch, began his bid from the five path approaching the quarter pole and gained
ground quickly in late stretch, just missing the place. BARNYARD FIDDLER trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and
improved position between horses in the stretch. EL CAMINANTE raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the four path
and finished evenly. BATTLE N AWAY raced between horses in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, and was
outkicked in the final furlong. PETEIZUM raced inside at the back of the pack early, came around the turn in the two path, angled out entering the stretch
and offered no bid. WILDCAT LITE pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn and
weakened in the final furlong. INTERNET SUCCESS hit the gate at the break, recovered to press the pace between horses up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.
