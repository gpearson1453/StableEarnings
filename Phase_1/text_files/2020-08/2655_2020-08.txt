SURE SHE'S GRAND unhurried into the far turn near the inside, shifted out entering the stretch, dug in determinedly in the six path under right handed
urging and got up in the final strides. FLASHY PATCH broke in front, set all the pace, drifted to the five path and just missed hanging on. DARING unhurried
early, swung wide and was steadily gaining ground late in the seven path. IF YOU BELIEVE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened.
CIPHERIN' SUE failed to menace. HALO'S PARADISE stalked the pace three wide through the far turn then gave way.

Footnotes
MORE MONIQUE broke well and dueled for the lead two wide into the turn, shook clear when set down under a right handed whip and won under a hand
ride. CREATE AN EDGE chased the pace and finished second best in the four path. OUR PRINCESS BELLE was squeezed at the start, never far back and
finished with good courage in the five path. PREFER DIAMONDS settled mid pack and had a mild late rally in the six path. JILLY FROM JERSEY well
placed, failed to respond. FACTUM'S REWARD was no factor. MCKINLI'SBABYBLUES was no threat. DAWNMINO had brief speed. GRADY'S LADY was
always outrun. COUNTING TIME pressured the winner two wide into the turn, stopped and was eased to the wire.
