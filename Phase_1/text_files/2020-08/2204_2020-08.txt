Footnotes
FASTROADAHEAD, between rivals early, lacked room briefly near quarter, eased out, engaged for the lead in deep stretch and got the nod. ABOVE PAR
was three wide dueling, edged clear mid stretch and held on tenaciously. SOUR MASH saved ground vying for command and then weakened. LUSCIOUS
LOLA saved ground and tired. MISSING HOOVER dueled for command between foes before tiring. CATCH A PEEP ,very wide, failed to menace.
TIBERIAN EMPRESS showed little. PLAY BY PLAY was never a factor.

GENERAL BELLAMY reserved inside the dueling leaders, rallied into the stretch, finished determinedly and was just up at the wire. AMERICAN ROMA vied
outside, took over midway on the final turn, widened to mid-stretch but was nailed at the finish. FINGLAS lagged far behind inside then closed well when too
late. YOU'RE NO SAINT dropped far behind inside and lacked a solid rally. METAPHORICAL dueled along the inside and began fading on the final turn.
DIAMOND SQUARE urged inside early, angled three wide after half a mile and tired. BELLY DANCER chased far behind throughout losing contact with his
field.

Footnotes
AHSAD was three wide in second flight, this after another drawn out gate load, eased out a bit wider rallying through stretch, took the lead in deep stretch.
ABDAA in the three path, split rivals on the far turn, was bumped into SANTO and forced to take up near mid stretch, recovered and gained place. JAMA
DILLON vied for command two wide, drifted out entering the stretch then drifted in bumping ABDAA into SANTO and weakened slightly. SANTO dueled for
command along the rail, was bumped near mid stretch and also fought gamely to the wire. SPIDER BITE saved ground just off the pace, angled out and
tired. FACTUM LOVE STYLE, outrun, bore out badly into stretch. HIBACHI raced outside and came up empty. STRATEGIC LEGACY, wide, failed to be a
serious threat. SHOOGER RAY TOO fell back after an alert start then never threatened. DEL PO also dropped back after breaking alertly and then stopped.
WITH THE RAIL OUT 22 FEET, FRACTIONAL TIMES WERE HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MAP OF AMERICA angled in after the start and got to the rail on the turn, edged clear near stretch, extended her lead under strong handling. HELENE
JACQUELINE stalked inside, drifted out leaving the turn and was no match. CONGRATS ANSWER, fractious prestart, saved ground and failed to menace.
PALOMA GRIS raced wide and was never a threat. RISQUE'S JEWEL, wide, showed little. BROAD JUMPER broke slowly and failed to menace.
BROOKLYN HEIGHTS ducked out leaving the gate, remained wide and tired. PERFECT SONG, just off the rail and just off the early pace, tired. JAMIE'S
WANDERLUST WAS SCRATCHED ON THE ADVICE OF THE VETERINARIAN. A CONSOLATION DAILY DOUBLE WAS PAID.

Footnotes
DUBINI lacked speed, advanced outside, bid very wide into the stretch, offered a late surge to get up in time. HOLLYWOOD TALENT forced the pace
outside, took over into the stretch, rallied clear briefly and continued gamely to the finish. BATTLE STATION saved ground throughout, made a menacing
bid into the stretch but was outfinished. SMOOTH B bobbled at the break, rushed up wide and offered some late energy. AMBLIN MAN was urged just off
the pacesetters and flattened out in the stretch. VERY COLORFUL raced far behind then passed a fading rival. DANCING BULL hustled to the front inside,
was collared into the stretch and gave way.

the gate, was two wide and fought gamely for place. KADENS COURAGE bumped with MY DANZIG PARTNER soon after start, saved ground and fought
gamely to wire. JUMP SHOT, outrun to stretch, split rivals in stretch but was too late. WEST FORK, four wide dueling for the lead, drifted out near mid
stretch and tired. ACERE raced wide, steadied off heels in mid stretch. KINETIC STRIKE dueled for command three wide before tiring. RULES was two
wide vying for command then had little left. SR.'S THRILL raced very wide and failed to menace. SUCCEED QUIETLY broke slowly and showed little. YES
