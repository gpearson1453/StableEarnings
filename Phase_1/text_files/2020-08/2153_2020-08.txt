MY DANNY BOY was never far back, rallied at the quarter pole on the rail and quickly made the lead, remained well clear in the lane while being ridden out.
MAN UP DUDE was well placed, throughout, was no match for the winner in the lane but was second best. SILVER EDGE was slow early, angled in stretch
and finished well to be gaining. TYLER TIME set a pressured pace and gradually weakened . MORE THUNDER raced close up early and gradually faded.
CHANGE HANDS contended until the top of the stretch and weakened. PROPER HUMOR was always outrun.

GYPSUM JOHNNY was well placed early, rallied at the top of the stretch four wide, drew off late under left handed urging. BORSA VENTO set the pace
through moderate fractions, was hooked at the quarter pole, could not match strides late with the winner but held place. RELENTLESS LION had good
position throughout, rallied four wide late and just missed place. PRAISE THE MOON pressed the pace and remained a sharp factor until mid stretch then
weakened. POPPY'S TWO STEP allowed to settle early, lacked a late kick and went evenly. SIR DOUGLAS allowed to settle, failed to menace. RIDE THIS
TRAIN showed little and trailed.

rallied in the stretch and was second best. GOLDEN PORTER was in hand early, rallied in the stretch and was up for show. ALEXA G raced mid pack and
went evenly. NOTION'S BEAUTY dueled on the lead and weakened in late stretch. MISS SVENGAIL vied for the early lead and gave way after a half.
HARDY JOJO was no factor. KAROL G had speed for a half, then stopped in the stretch.
