RUN FOR BOSTON Lagged back along the two path, took the four path on the last turn, five wide into the lane, lost the whip, quickly found the lead and
drew off while under mild right handed slapping for the win. MAGNETRON Unhurried along the three path, gained on the last turn, four wide into the lane,
angled wide and rallied. CLARE'S SON PETER Forced the issue along the two path, three path midway on the last turn and finished with interest inside.
KICHIRO Stumbled badly at the start, well placed along the rail, eased out in the lane and failed to respond. A MAIZE ZING RIP Set the pace along the rail
while pressed, took the two path on the last turn, chased the winner some and weakened. SEVEN X TIPPET Well placed along the three path and tired.
