Footnotes
HOPTOWN HONEY bumped with an inner foe at the start, pulled forward to stalk the pace setter from the three path and between horses, bid for the lead at
the five sixteenths pole, dueled with her inner counterpart in upper stretch, and edged an advantage in the late stages. HAYNESFEST set the pace staying
a path off of the inner rail, dug in to hold an advantage turning for home, but was headed at the furlong pole, then fought on to secure place. ITS COLD IN
DEHERE was squeezed back between horses at the start, tracked from midpack three wide in the four path around the turn, inched forward turning for
home, but did not have enough to produce a bid and chased the leaders home. SUNSET PAULA JO stalked the pace along the inside, but failed to produce
a rail bid through the lane and finished up evenly. ERV'S WENCH had a slow start, trailed early on, took the turn in the two to three path, but failed to factor.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE bumped a foe at the start, saved ground far off of the pace, and never got involved. PER RULING FROM THE INDIANA RACING
COMMISSION, HOPTOWN HONEY WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
UNCLE MOMO dueled for the lead two wide and between horses early on, held an advantage from a pair of outer foes around the turn while staying in the
two path, inched clear from those foes in upper stretch, and held his margin gamely through the lane. WHITE WOLF stalked the pace along the inside early
on, came under a tight hold to keep from running up on the leader's heels at the half mile pole, shifted to the five path while commencing a rally at the five
sixteenths pole to be outside of the leading trio, then sustained a grinding rally through the lane to prevail for place, but failed to catch the clear leader.
WOOPIGSOOIE dueled for the lead along the inside early on, but failed to keep pace with outer foes into the turn, saved ground while trailing turning for
home, then produced a mild rerally along the rail through the lane, but did not have enough to threaten the leader, and missed place. ASONGFORYOU
hopped a bit at the start, progressed to be in range of the pace three wide and between horses, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but was repelled
by the leader in upper stretch, then got outfinished for minor rewards. TOOTHPIC prompted the pace four wide, vied between horses turning for home, but
weakened at the furlong pole.

Footnotes
CORBIN trailed in the three path around the first turn, advanced to midpack into the far turn, shifted from the three to the four path around that bend, then
sustained a rally outside of the tiring leaders in the late stages, bid at the sixteenth pole, then cleared off approaching the wire. D'ARK FLATTER dueled for
the lead three to two wide around the first turn, forged a lead between horses into the far turn before being headed by CHIEF RED BULL at the five
sixteenths pole, dug in and battled gamely inside of that foe through the lane, but was bested by an outer oncharging foe approaching the wire while
prevailing in the duel for place. CHIEF RED BULL tracked from midpack three wide around the first turn, advanced into the backstretch to stalk three wide
from just off the leaders, bid and forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to kick clear of his inner game counterpart, dueled outside of that
foe through the lane, then weakened between horses approaching the wire, but just held show. SUNDAY DRIVE dueled for the lead along the inside, but
failed to keep pace with a pair of outer foes a the five sixteenths pole, then refound stride in the final furlong, shifted four wide at the sixteenth pole, and
came again outside of tiring foes, but missed place. GUN HILL stalked the pace along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leaders around the turn,
and faded thereafter. COLONEL MOON raced far off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the three to five path, and never got involved. BROTHER
DOC saved ground far off of the pace around the first turn, and was outrun therafter.

PRINCESSTAPITURE stalked the pace along the inside, came under a drive to keep pace with the leaders at the three furlong pole, split horses two wide at
the furlong pole to forge place with multiple lengths to find, but tipped outside of tiring leader at the sixteenth pole, and rallied to get up approaching the wire.
SEGURO dueled for the lead two wide, forged an an advantage at the seven sixteenths pole and held that margin from her inner counterpart around the
turn before drawing clear in upper stretch, but began to tire inside the furlong pole, and was worn down approaching the wire. AMERICA RULES chased the
pace three wide, inched closer turning for home, but hung on her left lead and weakened in upper stretch. STARLET EXPRESS dueled for the lead inside of
SEGURO, was headed by that foe at the seven sixteenths pole, held inside position around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch. JAMIN'S JET raced off
of the pace in the four path around the turn, and was no factor. MACI'S JAMMING was off multiple lengths behind the field, and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC BOLD set the pace in the two path, held a loose lead down the backstretch before feeling mild pressure from BEHOLD around the far turn, drew
clear of that foe in upper stretch while shifting to the three path, and held sway through the lane. SHEESA PONTIAC stalked along the inside, came under a
drive to keep pace into the turn, saved ground around the bend and produced a bid for place along the rail at the furlong pole, and prevailed over outer foes
for that position in the late stages. MY GIRL ROCKET saved ground around the turns while off of the pace, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, then
rallied and split foes at the sixteenth pole to prevail for show. BEHOLD was forwardly placed and stalked two wide while in the three path, came under a
drive to chase the loose leader into the far turn, inched forward to attempt a bid for the lead turning for home, but proved no match for the leader in upper
stretch, and got outfinished by inner foes for a minor reward. AIR TURBULENCE tracked from midpack three wide while in the four path, inched forward to
stalking position into the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch. VIOLATION tracked from midpack in the two path, inched closer two wide around the far
turn to produce a bid for place between horses in upper stretch, but yielded at the sixteenth pole. MOLLY'S GAME saved ground far off of the pace, and
never got involved. LADY BREXIT tracked off of the pace two wide around the first turn, then took the far turn in the four path and failed to factor. MY
WYNTER ROSE trailed in the two path around the first turn, then in the five path around the far turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
WELLINGTON WONDER tracked from midpack two wide, came under a drive at the half mile pole as SERENA BECK rallied alongside, got outmoved as
that foe made first run into the far turn, saved ground around that bend before tipping to the four path at the quarter pole to rally outside of the leaders, blew
past those foes at the furlong pole, and drew off. SERENA BECK raced off of the pace in the four to three path, advanced past inner foes at the half mile
pole to forge show into the far turn, advanced on the dueling leaders in hand around the far turn to produce a three wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole,
took over turning for home, but hung on her left lead, was overhauled by the eventual winner at the furlong pole, then held place thereafter.
DONTYOUREMEMBER raced far off of the pace two wide, then in the four path around the far turn, advanced while being floated to the five path by the
eventual winner at the quarter pole, but was outkicked by that rival in upper stretch, then kept on to pass tiring foes but missed place. COPPER NICKEL
dueled for the lead inside of NOTHINGBUTFLOWERS, sustained the duel as the opened up on the rest of the field down the backstretch, held an
advantage around the far turn, but was headed by SERENA BECK passing the quarter pole, and weakened in midstretch. SHES THE CAUSE saved
ground far off of the pace around the first turn, took the far turn in the three to four path, and never got involved. NOTHINGBUTFLOWERS dueled for the
lead outside of COPPER NICKEL through a fast pace, and weakened between horses turning for home. MINTCHOCOLATECHIP stalked along the inside,
but was outmoved by outer foes into the far turn, weakened, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
MR. GARY D set a pressured but moderate pace along the inside of a pair of foes, held an advantage from a trio of rivals around the far turn, then shook
clear in upper stretch, and held under driving pressure. HEMP HEMP HURRAY raced far off of the pace two wide, trailed into the far turn, split foes in the
three path in upper stretch to commence a rally, surged between the leaders through the final furlong, but ran out of ground and missed on the wire.
ARTIE'S RUMOR vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch, then got outfinished by
an inner oncharging rival for place. QUALITY STEP was caught four wide around the first turn, advanced to stalking position into the backstretch, further
progressed into the far turn to make a four wide bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, but failed to keep pace with inner foes due to ground loss turning
for home, and flattened out in upper stretch. PEEKACHO tracked from midpack in the two path, swung to the five path at the quarter pole, and offered a mild
late kick. NEVER EVEN CALLED stalked the pace along the inside, but failed to make a bid and weakened through the lane. UNO EMAYO saved ground
around the turns while far off of the pace, but was restrained behind a clear foe in upper stretch, then failed to factor thereafter. HIGH POWERED prompted
the pace three wide, bid for the lead between horses into the far turn, but weakened turning for home. EVIL EYE raced far off of the pace three wide, and
weakened in the four path turning for home.

Footnotes
FLATTER HYMN advanced past many inner foes in the six path around the turn to vie for the lead three wide into the backstretch, sustained the bid around
the far turn and battled gamely with inner foes in upper stretch, then prevailed passing the furlong pole under a long drive. MAI TAI'S GEM vied for the lead
two wide and between horses, dug in gamely in upper stretch while sustaining the duel, but was headed by his outer counterpart passing the furlong pole,
fought on, but was second best. TWO LAST WORDS stalked along the inside, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and offered a late kick, but did not
have enough to achieve place. STRONG TIDE was forwardly placed two wide and between horses early on, stalked the trio of leaders from the four path
around the far turn, but was floated to the five path in upper stretch, and finished up evenly. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK vied for the lead inside of a pair of
foes, held a narrow advantage around the far turn, but was headed by those foes at the furlong pole, and weakened. STARSPANGLEDXPRESS was
caught in the five path around both turns, weakened at the three furlong pole, and was done early. IDEA MAN stumbled a bit at the start but was not cost
