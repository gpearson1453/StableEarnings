Footnotes
SAV broke outward, up to duel, edged ahead early turn and shook clear mid turn, widened a bit upper stretch and held under light handling. JEANIE B (GB)
settled in mid pack, saved ground through the turn, was blocked upper stretch, moved to the rail then rallied gamely and was gaining late. ABOVE ALL
NAMES lost her path at the outset, stalked the pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive.
WESTERN CURL got away a step slowly and settled off the pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide late turn then rallied willingly from the outside.
MAGIC SPELL raced in mid pack, closed two to four-wide late turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the late stages. ALKELINE settled in mid pack,
came two-wide through the turn, was blocked a furlong out and failed to menace. SUMMERLAND dueled on the backstretch, was headed early turn, stalked
to the stretch then tired in the final furlong.

then rallied with a late surge. JLOHR JAN was crowded early, settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn and finished under a
determined drive. HOITY TOITY led into the first turn, set a pressured pace, was passed a furlong out and gave way. PIPESTONE came out early and
crowded JLOHR JAN, settled in range, chased hard three-wide on the far turn, failed with an all out bid in the stretch and flattened out. DELIGHTFUL

Footnotes
BRASSY, in mid pack early, closed four-wide late turn, bid in the final furlong and quickly drew clear and finished under a brisk hand ride. EMPIRE ANGEL
set a contested pace, shook clear four-wide at the top of the stretch, was collared a furlong, was no match for BRASSY but held place and was clearly best
of the rest. SWILLING settled off the pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then finished gamely. CLASSY GIZMO, in range, closed two
to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, was game but lost the show position in the late stages. TAPITLIKEITSHOT raced forwardly two-wide but
gave way at the top of the stretch. ICANCEECLEARLYNOW stalked the pacesetters, closed two-wide on the turn but failed to menace. SKY DRAGON,
rated in mid pack, dropped back on the turn, was hustled along and was steadied nearing the top of the stretch and lacked a rally. EXCELLING showed
speed, was prominent along the rail through the turn, was through at the top of the stretch and retreated. DEAR ONE raced in mid pack, was hustled four
then three-wide on the turn but was never in contention. MISSION CITY GIRL raced in mid pack, moved up and forced the pace briefly along the rail, was
taken back at the turn and faded.

SHE'S A DREAM showed brief speed, was headed then stalked the pace, came two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, led quickly and held
under a drive. VESPOLINA settled off the pace, came two to four-wide through the turn, closed into the stretch and chased the winner home. COOL
SOCIETY settled off the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn, was asked for an all out stretch drive and indeed was gaining late. TOO MANY
MOUNTANS raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide late turn and finished under a determined drive. MISS BOBBIT moved up early and took command,
set a pressured pace, turned back CURLIN'S TIGER early turn but was headed upper stretch and gave way. PIPER'S SKY, off slowly, closed on the
backstretch, stalked from the rail on the turn then evened out in the final furlong. SHE'S A TRUE FOX, off slowly, raced in mid pack, chased two-wide into
the stretch but lacked a closing response. TOUCH OF ROUGE, off slowly, settled in range, came four and five-wide through the turn then lacked a rally.
CURLIN'S TIGER closed on the backstretch, loomed up outside the leader early turn, could not match strides, stalked to the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
PINK LLOYD broke well and was allowed to settle while on hold stalking the leaders in the three path, dropped in to chase the pacesetters along the rail into
the turn, came out to split those two front runners inside the eighth pole and opened a clear lead, then held on late, his margin of victory diminishing in the
final yards. OLYMPIC RUNNER fell back to an off the pace rail spot early, rallied inside on the turn and followed the winner, on his heels in upper stretch,
shifted out inside the eighth pole and was closing fast late. MALIBU SECRET led quickly under a hold, allowed a rival up the inside to take the front down
the backside, pressed that one around the turn and led briefly in upper stretch, succumbing to the rally of the top two but holding the show spot stubbornly.
ROARING FORTIES came up the rail to take the lead after a sixteenth, was pressed and dueled by a rival through the turn and upper stretch, fading back to
hold onto a minor award late. MAGICAL MAN trailed the field early, came into range while in the two path around the turn, then could only close mildly to
threaten for a minor award late without challenging for the top two spots. WHITE FLAG broke on top and was allowed to drop back in the early going, came
with a three to four wide circle move on the turn to look dangerous by the quarter pole, fanned five to six wide turning for home and stalled in the final
furlong, still wide. DUN DRUM settled in mid pack, stayed outside the winner into and around the turn, angled out at the quarter pole to take his shot but
wilted inside the final furlong.

Footnotes
CLAYTON broke inward and was steadied, stalked the pace, closed three and four-wide on the far turn, bid upper stretch, battled, gained a narrow
advantage a 16th out and prevailed under a drive. HALO AGAIN, bumped at the outset, forced the pace, bid three-wide late turn, was headed at the top of
the stretch, rebid quickly, dueled, was headed in the final furlong, was determined, couldn't get to the winner but outfinished DOTTED LINE for place.
DOTTED LINE set a pressured pace, was engaged late on the far turn, regained control at the top of the stretch but the lead was short-lived, dueled inside
two others, was headed near the 16th pole and weakened to lose the place award near the wire. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE broke inward, stalked the pace, was
hustled two and three-wide on the far turn then finished under a determined drive. ELUSIVE KNIGHT, off a step slowly then rated off the pace, closed three
and four-wide on the far turn and chased through the stretch. NORTHERN THUNDER broke inward and bumped HALO AGAIN, settled off the pace, was
hustled two-wide through the far turn, trailed into the stretch and lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
CURLIN'S VOYAGE settled off the pace, closed on the backstretch to gain a stalking position, bid inside the leader near the top of the stretch, drew clear
then held under a drive. AFLEET KATHERINE stalked the pace, chased two and three-wide through the far turn, launched her drive at the top of the stretch
but was outkicked by the winner. MERVEILLEUX settled off the pace, closed along the rail on the far turn, encountered traffic at the top of the stretch but got
clear and finished gamely. MIZZEN BEAU was close to the first turn and the front when INFINITE PATIENCE cut over to the rail on the lead, startling
BAYOU BELLE who ducked out, then MIZZEN BEAU reacted with her own shift, remaining in range, chased four then three-wide on the final turn but
evened out in the late stages. JUSTLEAVEITALONE raced in mid pack, was checked two-wide in tight between foes entering the far turn, regained
momentum and was hustled along, chased into the stretch but evened out with a 16th to run. PILOT EPISODE settled in mid pack, dropped back at the far
turn, was hustled along the rail, moved two-wide approaching the top of the stretch, chased to mid stretch and flattened out. INFINITE PATIENCE gained
the early lead and cut to the rail approaching the clubhouse turn, set a reserved pace, was engaged late on the final turn and was headed at the top of the
stretch then retreated gradually. LASTING UNION three-wide on the first turn, raced in mid pack early then dropped back still on the backstretch, closed four
and five-wide on the far turn then evened out in mid stretch. BAYOU BELLE ducked out entering the clubhouse turn, stalked the pace two-wide on the first
turn then faded three-wide from midway of the far turn and lacked a rally. NOVEMBER FOG hopped out of the gate and settled off the pace, raced
three-wide on the first turn, and was hustled four-wide on the far turn but offered no response when asked in the stretch.

Footnotes
MUSKOKA GIANT settled off the pace before commencing a three to five wide circling run on the turn, was fanned out into the eight path as the field
bunched turning for home, engaged the leader outside the eighth pole, wore that one down in the final sixteenth and held off a closer late. ENCHANT ME
was bumped by a rival early and settled off the pace, came three to four wide inside the winner on the turn, shifted in from the seven path turning for home
to momentarily lose momentum in upper stretch, then regrouped and rallied again in the final seventy yards to grab the place spot. BENLION took out of a
mad scramble for the lead, sat behind a four way duel before angling out two to four wide late on the turn, drove to the front in upper stretch but was headed
by the winner near the eighth pole and lost the place spot late as well. RED MERCURY broke out at the start and settled near the rear, moved up in the two
to three path on the turn but lost ground when the field bunched up turning for home, angled out by the three sixteenths pole and had too much to do,
closing in for a minor award in the final furlong while wide. GRAZELY took out of a five way battle for the early lead to chase four rivals late backstretch and
turn, was asked for run at the top of the stretch but lugged in upper stretch and closed mildly in the final sixteenth. BURNING LOVE was herded at the start
before rushing up five wide to battle for the front, still four wide contesting around the turn and led into the stretch but wilted down the lane. CANADIAN
PHAROAH was inside a five and four horse duel, began to drop back midway on the turn, tried to battle back in upper stretch, drifting off the inside and
passing a few stragglers. ARTIE MY BOY was off slowly, rushed up inside to chase the battling leaders on the turn, seemed hard to handle with the rider
steadying and dropping back, never looking comfortable while trying to re-join the party in the stretch. PARDSY was in between rivals in a five and four
horse run to the front, stayed on gamely until the top of the stretch but retreated down the lane. BIRCHMOUNT RD was two wide in a five then four horse
battle for the lead, had a brief advantage three-eighths out but succumbed to the pressure in the stretch.
