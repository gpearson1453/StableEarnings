held well into the stretch and was worn down late. EMMY GOT EVEN vied for the lead between foes, proved no match for the top pair and kept on.
JESSICA GLITTERS raced forwardly along the inside and lacked a rally. WISE EYES was fractious behind the starting gate and failed to threaten. RUN

Footnotes
BEE BRIDGE forced the pace, gained a narrow lead on the far turn and dug in gamely in the stretch. BLAME IT ON JR led early, was headed on the far
turn, responded to pressure and stayed on willingly. ANSWER IN THE WIND raced striking position while three wide, remained three wide into the stretch
and kept on well. DEBONNAIRE DUDE leapt in the air at the start, was settled, angled out four wide for the stretch run and managed a mild bid. CIAK never
menaced. MINGO BORN dwelt at the start and did not factor. DREAMIN OF GLORY got loose in the post parade and faltered in the race. FOLLOWING
THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND MADE NO CHANGES.
