Footnotes
REND LAKE BABY dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, kicked clear approaching the three eighths pole, entered the stretch from the two
path and remained in command to the wire. LA NEGRA NOCHE bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, tracked the frontrunners on the
inside, began a bid from the rail passing the three eighths pole and chased the winner home, proving to be the best of the rest. ASHLEYSDREAM was
slightly reluctant to load, bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, dueled for the lead on the rail up the backstretch, continued to save ground
around the turn, and faded entering the stretch. VICE GRIP broke slowly and was pinched back leaving the gate, trailed far behind the field up the
backstretch and around the turn, made up some ground in the stretch but was never a factor. SUNDANCE CHICK tracked the leaders on the outside,
navigated the turn from the two path and was finished after three eighths of a mile had been run.

Footnotes
MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH raced between horses in the tracking flight early, stalked in the three path on the turn, bid two wide into the lane, took the lead at the
three sixteenths, and held sway under a drive. UGO chased inside of RED PRINCE down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, was pushed
along past the three eighths, rallied well under a drive in the final furlong and got up outside of MAGI for second in the final strides. MAGI raced three wide
in the tracking flight early, continued to track the pace in the five path on the turn, went to a drive three wide in the lane, chased while no match for MAGIC
MAN'S TOUCH, and lost the place to UGO approaching the wire. BOLD ATTACK raced at the inside of the tracking flight early, chased while saving ground
through the turn, continued to give chase while under a drive in the lane but lacked the needed kick. FREAKIN JOE was sent for speed, dictated the pace
down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was headed by MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH at the three sixteenths and weakened inside. PRUDENT
HERO settled at the rear early, saved ground while trailing through the bend, took closer order under a drive in the lane but was ultimately no threat. RED
PRINCE chased well off the pace outside of UGO early, continued in the five path on the turn, and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
ROOM TO FINISH raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside in the middle of the pack, navigated the far turn
from the two path, began her bid approaching the quarter pole and closed rapidly in the final furlong to just get up for the win. OH SO TERRIBLE led the
field a bit keenly around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was caught in the final
stride. RUSSIAN MAFIA raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch on the outside, began a bid from the rail around the
far turn, swung out in upper stretch to find racing room and gained ground late. CARISSA CRISMAS chased the leader from the two path around the first
turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and weakened in the final strides. DIAMONDS ARE A saved ground around the
first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and faded in late stretch. LATEST
VERSION saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, remained at the back of the pack around the far turn and
made no bid.

GOLD HAWK chased the leading pair, was pushed along two wide into the second turn, reeled in the leader around that bend, vied outside of ORCUS for
the lead two wide from the quarter pole to the three sixteenths, drove clear from there, and was ridden out in the final sixteenth. RICH E Z settled toward the
rear, was urged into the second turn, improved between horses in the four path on the far turn, went to a drive near the quarter pole, kept on earnestly, got
up for second past the sixteenth but proved no match for the leader. ORCUS disputed the pace two wide through the first turn, edged away to a clear lead
down the backstretch, continued to set the pace in the two path on the far turn, was caught by GOLD HAWK near the quarter pole, vied inside of that one to
the three sixteenths, began to flatten out, and lost second inside the sixteenth pole. SUMNER settled at the inside of the rear pair through the clubhouse
turn, trailed down the backstretch, took closer order in the three to four path on the far turn, was driven between horses three wide into the lane, and chased
on while no match to the top three. SATURDAYS HANGOVER settled two wide in the rear pair through the first turn, continued near the rear down the
backstretch, raced three wide toward the rear around the far turn, fanned four wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally. LANDING GEAR chased
midpack, was pushed along in the three path on the far turn, came into the lane between horses and mustered no bid. CADET CAPTAIN disputed the pace
inside of ORCUS through the clubhouse turn, gradually lost ground on that leader from the three quarters, weakened while saving ground through the far
turn and was empty for the drive.

SYDNEY'S TREASURE raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the frontrunners up the backstretch, began her bid from the two path passing
the half mile pole, took over the lead and was clear the entire way down the stretch. WILDWOOD MAGGIE raced in the two path around the first turn, came
up the backstretch on the outside, began to improve position from the two path on the far turn and continued to gain ground on the outside in the stretch.
LILYS FROM PARIS hopped up leaving the gate, angled over to save ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn from the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and rallied between horses in the stretch. MILLIE bumped with the horse to
her inside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the outside, came around the
second turn in the three path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. EXECUTIVE TIME raced on the inside at the back of the pack through the opening half
mile, offered a mild bid while saving ground approaching the three eighths pole and faded in the stretch. LAURA ATTACK led the field on the inside around
the first turn and up the backstretch, relinquished the lead while still saving ground around the far turn and continued to tire in the stretch. COCOA PEACH
was fractious in the gate, bumped with the horse to her outside at the break, moved up to challenge the leader from the two path around the first turn, began
to drop back headed into the far turn and continued to fade from there.

BIZZEE CHANNEL pressed the pace outside GIRLOLAMO'GLORY through the clubhouse turn, increased the pressure into the backstretch, engaged
outside that foe near the half mile mark, took the lead near the seven sixteenths, was confronted by EXPROMPT near the three eighths, vied inside that foe
from there to the quarter pole, shook clear into the lane, and drew off under a drive. STOCK TRADE tracked the leading pair through the first turn, chased at
the middle of a compact field down the backstretch, was pushed along two wide through the far turn, kept on mildly in the lane, got up for second outside of
EXPROMPT near the sixteenth mark, and proved second best. EXPROMPT (FR) chased two wide through the clubhouse turn, pulled two wide into the
backstretch, tracked the leading pair, bid three wide on the far turn, vied outside of BIZZEE CHANNEL from the three eighths to the quarter pole, was no
match past the quarter pole despite going to a drive, flattened out and lost second near the sixteenth mark. AND WON was lightly bumped by
GIRLOLAMO'GLORY in the opening strides, settled at the rear, was pushed along past the half mile mark, took closer order through the far turn, came into
the lane under a drive in the four path and passed tiring horses. RIVER CACTUS settled near the rear, was pushed along in the four path on the far turn,
went to a drive between horses into the lane, but lacked the needed kick. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY broke inward and lightly bumped AND WON in the opening
strides, set a pressured pace through the clubhouse turn inside of BIZZEE CHANNEL, took heavier pressure down the backstretch, vied with BIZZEE
CHANNEL past the half mile mark, emptied out near the seven sixteenths, and weakened inside. Missing times determined following video review.

Footnotes
RIVER EVANGELIST settled second last, made a smooth circling rally around the second turn, came four wide into the lane, continued to rally four to five
wide, led inside the furlong mark and finished best. FORT RIDGE was shut off behind FLEETWAY and CHRISTIAN C in the opening strides, raced between
horses near the rear through the far turn and down the backstretch, rallied in the three path through the far turn, came into the lane under a drive inside of
horses, rallied three wide midstretch outside of the leading pair, but was outkicked by the winner. CHRISTIAN C broke slightly inward, pressed the pace
outside of FLEETWAY, vied on the pace outside that foe through the far turn and into the lane, kept on to midstretch but weakened in the final sixteenth.
SUMMER CASTLE tracked in the pocket, continued in range in the three path on the far turn, was taken out in upper stretch and driven four wide, but
leveled off in the final furlong. FLEETWAY broke outward, set the pace while pressured by CHRISTIAN C, vied inside of that foe through the far turn and
into the lane, but weakened along the inside past the furlong mark. GOLDEN GIFT settled near the rear three wide, continued three wide between horses
midfield into the far turn, came into the lane two wide between horses and kept on evenly. BEHIND ENEMY LINES chased four wide into the far turn, was
keen two wide near midfield into the backstretch, continued midpack down the back straight, chased in the two path through the far turn, came into the lane
under a drive inside horses, but lacked the needed kick in the lane. DRAGUNOV tracked the pace three wide into the first turn, continued to track two to
three wide on the backstretch and three wide on the far turn, came three wide into the lane but came up empty for the drive. NO CENTS LEFT hit the gate
and came awkwardly into stride, settled at the rear, was urged two wide into the second turn, but lacked the needed rally. VOLGOGRAD settled near the
rear on the inside, was pushed along into the far turn and angled off the rail past the three eighths, but had no rally. FORT DIXIE was forward between
horses into the clubhouse turn, settled midfield down the backstretch, weakened inside through the far turn, and had no more for the drive.
