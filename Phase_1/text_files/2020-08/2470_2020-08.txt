MY TIME TO SHINE stalked the pace pressing in bid on the turn drawing off in upper stretch. FOXY JOXY went evenly through the turn angling five wide in
upper stretch coming on to save place. MS. NINEONESEVEN pressed early then chased on the turn, raced evenly on the inside down the lane. TWO
DIAMONDS hustled along pursued through the turn moving evenly down the lane. CHARLIES HOT slow early played no factor. CHOCOLATE CANDY
failed to menace. TROPICAL RUNNINGS was always a step slow. HEY FUNNY was always outrun. PRECIOUS BETH pressed the pace through the turn
then stopped abruptly in upper stretch.
