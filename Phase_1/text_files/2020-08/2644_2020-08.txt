YOU GO GIRL broke sharply to press the pace of HONEY BAY BEE while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and drew off as
a handy winner. ALOTMOREACTION tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, was no match for the winner but finished well to gain
the place. HONEY BAY BEE was away alertly to set a pressured pace from off the rail and gave way to the winner after going a half. BEAZEE BOLT lagged

BEARCREEK MOUNTAIN stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with VROYSKY through a prolonged
drive and edged away late. WILSON TO LOCKETT was off slow and checked, lagged early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive
and finished with good energy. VROYSKY sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, responded when challenged by the winner nearing
the quarter, vied with that rival through a vigorous drive and gave way grudgingly. ALWAYS WORKING settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the turn and failed to rally. L D' RADO GOLDRUSH broke sharply to chase the leaders from the inside and weakened after going three furlongs.

four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. JACOMINA lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth

furlongs. LOVE ON THE FLY was bumped at the start, settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. XIMENA'S HONOR
raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and did not menace. COWGIRL KINGDOM was off a step slow and bumped, raced
unhurried early, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. COASTAL MIST was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through

Footnotes
MIKA THE MISTRESS sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and held by a diminishing
margin. EMMA'S A BEAST broke sharply to stalk the winner while racing three-wide, responded through the final sixteenth and was gaining that rival late to
just miss. SHEZ A GRINDER broke awkwardly, lagged early, saved ground, remained inside for the drive, finished well while steadying late. WAVERLY
WAY lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. I WANT ONE chased the leaders from between foes and gradually
weakened. TAPTOO was forwardly placed, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SIX BLESSINGS tracked the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew clear through the closing yards.
CANDIED LUTE was bumped at the start, pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, gained a brief lead but could
not match strides with the winner late. BALIUS settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. STANLEY'S
WAVE was bumped at the break, set a pressured pace for a half and gave way. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through the turn and failed to menace. LITTLE HOUSE hopped at the start, showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach
contention. AMANDA'S BEACH BOY was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BATTLE POINT RED was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane and held sway to the wire. IRISH
SWING was bumped at the break, settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. CELTURIAN was
reserved just off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. JIMJIMMYJAMES was bumped at the
start, settled off the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. WINNING BLUFF showed no early
speed, raced off the rail through the turn and finished with a belated bid. MIDNIGHT IN MAUI raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the
turn and finished with some late run. ONLY THE HIGH ROAD lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TADEO broke
sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. AZADI lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. THE SUPPLY PROGRAM chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

TIME FOR GOLD was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and drew off
through the lane as an easy winner. SACAGEWEA pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that foe in the drive but clearly
second best. PATRICIA L was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. EASY SILENCE hopped
at the start, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with some late run. MALIBU MISTRESS broke in,
settled off the leaders from the inside and failed to rally. LA PANZANELLA was bumped at the break, raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide
through the turn and did not threaten. BETHEL RIDGE was bumped at the start, showed brief speed and weakened. MANAGINGBRIANNA broke out,
lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

PURE PURSUIT was away alertly to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear lead into the lane and drew off with complete authority. NO
HARBOR IN SIGHT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished with a
steady bid. DOCKTARRI lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. IRON ROB was void of early speed, saved
ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with some late run. SWINGSHIFT DEPUTY pressed the pace while racing three-wide
and weakened after going a half. MISO FAST was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. FAR
WEST lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not menace. SUNSHINE EMILY was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the

Footnotes
DUDLEY STUDLEY sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off through the lane. CATS TOUCH was bumped at
the break, lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and was up for the place.
SHOCKAZULU was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, could not gain on the winner but finished willingly. SWAY
ROAD settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain late. GENERAL MACH FOUR chased the
winner while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. KALAKALA lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BERNIE was
void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. CATS CHAMP raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through
the turn and weakened. DALLON'S GOLD was away in good order to chase the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.
SEATTLE SMOKE lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. WORKING was bumped at the start, showed no early
speed, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten.
