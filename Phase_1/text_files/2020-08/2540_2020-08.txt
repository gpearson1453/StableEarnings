recovered and raced well back in about the two path, split rivals leaving mid stretch, shifted out and finished well to be gaining. ELUSIVE MOTION pulled
clear early, set the pace two wide, widened under a drive soon into the lane, could not resist the winner nearing the sixteenth marker and weakened late.

stalked the pace, was under pressure three wide chasing the leader into the lane, held well to mid stretch then faded. NIC NIC BOOM , four wide outside
rivals, made a run nearing the lane then weakened through the drive. CECIL THE LION edged up inside runners nearing the three quarter pole, pursued to

Footnotes
SWIRRLIE SHIRLIE , brushed and steadied at the break, regrouped and settled well off the rail, took closer order leaving the far turn, circled five wide into
the lane, closed in under left handed rousing, collared DAT DARES GOLD past the sixteenth pole, dueled outside that one in deep stretch and got the bob.
DAT DARES GOLD sped to the front and set the pace in the two path, handled outside pressure around the turn, moved further off the rail into the lane,
shook clear under a drive past the three sixteenths, drifted outward, met the winner's bid, battled gamely and lost a heartbreaker. BUSTIN HEARTS forced
the pace three wide, shifted in nearing mid stretch and continued with some effort. RAVENEL advanced four wide to contention, bid four wide outside the
leader mid turn, forced the issue into the lane and kept trying to the line. TRIXIE'S TIME broke inward then was corrected, raced towards the inside early,
angled three wide and lacked a solid bid. THEATERINTHEROUND , towards the inside with pursuit, faded in the drive. EIFS , between rivals early, angled
wide and failed to respond.

DIRTYFOOT sprinted to the early lead, saved ground around the turn, held a clear advantage in mid stretch, drifted out and determinedly prevailed. OUR
PHILLY SPECIAL , outside the winner, gamely chased that one throughout. GIRLS LOVE ME , unhurried down the backstretch, rallied nicely between
horses. COOKE BROTHERS . along the inner rail mid way on the turn, eased out leaving the bend, swung to the five path in upper stretch and came up
empty. ROBBER BOB , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, faltered. MYSTIC TIMES lacked speed, was fanned six deep turning for home and
failed to rally. I'MTHETAPITNOW stalked the pace, saved ground on the turn and faltered. FORFIFTYFIVEROCKET , steadied in narrow quarters soon after
the break, was asked leaving the backstretch but trailed.

KEWPIE DOLL stumbled at the break, recovered and tracked in hand, bid three deep leaving the far turn, dueled to the inside of BUCKEY'S CHARM after
that one threatened into the lane, responded to left handed rousing to retake command soon past the furlong grounds then edged clear under a steady
drive. BUCKEY'S CHARM angled out early and edged up four wide, bid four wide outside the winner nearing the lane, dueled and gained a slim lead past
the three sixteenths, failed to match strides inside the eighth pole but kept on well to the line. CLOSERTOTHEHEART gave hard chase while saving ground
mid turn, eased out in the drive and kept on with interest. RUNAWAY MONET dropped to the rail soon after the break, edged up to track, bid inside a pair of
rivals leaving the far turn and gained a slim lead, battled to upper stretch then late. LISHEEN , well back while saving ground, was under pressure mid turn,
angled out in upper stretch and had some late energy. OIL ON CANVAS chased off the rail and faded. KENS LADY sped clear early, set the pace two wide,
was joined from both sides nearing the three eighths, sparred past the five sixteenths then gave way. QUEEN KARMA , three wide near the three furlong
marker, shifted in and gave way. RODANTHE lost contact early, was eased when distanced and walked off.

Footnotes
PALM READER stalked the pace racing along the rail, eased out upper stretch, gained the lead late and drove clear. SAILINGINTOTHEWIND set the pace
along the rail and weakened in the drive. FED UP FIRED UP raced along the inner rail throughout and showed a late gain. LOOKIN DYNAMIC saved
ground around the far turn, angled out for the drive and failed to rally. SAVEDBYTHEBELLE saved ground on the turns, angled out turning for home and
lacked a rally. FIONNBHARR , no factor, was at least four wide on the far turn. CAMBELIZA , two wide down the backstretch, chased the pace, floated to
the three path entering the stretch and gave way. MIDSHIP LADY , fractious in the starting gate, rank at the break, failed to be a factor and was kept wide
throughout. CORRECTNESS , four wide the first turn, raced between horses the far turn and faltered. ONE LAST TRIAL faltered entering the stretch and
was eased.

Footnotes
BUNTING was sent to the front, set the pace towards the inside, was guided three wide and shaken up soon into the lane, widened in mid stretch, drifted in
under right handed pressure but proved clearly best. QUIET IMAGINATION dropped back after an alert start and was taken four wide, gathered some
momentum past the five sixteenths, swung out six wide in upper stretch and closed steadily to nab the place. MARGIE'S HEAVEN stalked the winner three
to four wide, was under pressure approaching the stretch and continued willingly to the line. ELEGANT GAL tracked two wide, moved out a path around the
turn, failed to keep pace into the lane and faded. COMBAT QUEEN rated three wide, angled out some leaving the far turn and was put to asking, made a
slight run heading to the quarter pole then faded. STICKINGTOGETHER , off the pace, was under a ride two to three wide nearing the lane but failed to
respond. SARAH'S TREASURE stumbled at the break, saved ground off the pace and failed to generate a run.

MAYAN QUEEN , well positioned inside horses on the far turn, was lightly steadied near the quarter pole, eased out at the head of the lane, engaged
UNSTOPABULL BELLE near the eighth pole and narrowly prevailed. UNSTOPABULL BELLE circled the far turn three wide, gained a short lead in upper
stretch, gave way grudgingly and was vanned off. CELEBRE (IRE) , no threat, raced inside horses and passed tired foes. CATCH THE SKY , outside
horses in the stretch, passed tired ones. SMART ENTRY lacked speed, and offered a mild, late move inside horses. PATRIOTIC PUNCH , outrside horses,
chased the pace to upper stretch and faltered. FOALSFILLYSPECIAL , no factor, passed tired horses. RAN CHAR , three wide the first turn, sprinted clear
on the backstretch and faltered. HAIRSPRAY showed speed and faltered. BEST MOON EVER weakened. SISTER SEVILLE was outrun. RYE STREET
chased the pace and faltered.
