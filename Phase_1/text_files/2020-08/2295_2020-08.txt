Footnotes
KISSTHATBABYGOODBY dueled from the inside early, gained a clear margin up the backstretch, remained clear through the second turn, continued to
show the way at the eighth pole and held sway in a gate to wire effort. FOOLISH STEVE dueled from the inside early, forced the pace up the backstretch,
remained forward for the drive but was no match for the winner while holding the place. DUE APEAL unhurried early from the outside, steadily advanced
through the second turn, responded when asked and rallied late for the shoiw. JOEMO allowed to settle early, advanced outside through the second turn,
responded but was too late. KID CREOLE could only pass tired ones. ONE KING CAT was no factor. BIG GIG chased the early pace outside and tired.
SPRING RODEO was no threat. BUFFON was finished after going a half.
