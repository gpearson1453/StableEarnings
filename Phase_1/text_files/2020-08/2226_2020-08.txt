Footnotes
BRODYTHEOXMAN angled out on the backstretch for room, rallied three wide on the far turn to grab the lead at the top of the stretch, drifted out late and
cleared away to the wire. STAND AND DELIVER tracked a clear leader, went between horses on the turn, evened out late but still managed to hold place.
WISE SOLDIER took a clear lead on the first turn, was caught nearing the stretch, evened out but was not passed and held show. TRUENO bumped a
horse at the start, went widest on the backstretch and widest down the stretch. TIMING raced close but dropped back between horses at the half mile pole
and ran evenly ffrom there.I'MYOURHUCKLEBERRY was bumped at the start, lost ground, and raced unhurried. RUN AWAY AMOS contended for a
quarter and stalled on the turn. Fractional times unavailable due to timer malfunction. Final time is hand timed.

in the stretch run. FRANKIE'S GIFT had a good break, raced one paced throughout with no response when needed in the stretch. ANNOULA raced off rail
throughout while never close. NESSUM DORMA never close throughout while passing tired ones in the stretch. SWEEPENO failed to menace. APRIL

Footnotes
SAMOA took over leaving the first turn, stayed in front of pressure by challengers throughout, and was in hand the final sixteenth. REWARDED chased the
game winner from the backstretch to the stretch, drifted out mid stretch and held second. PORTRAIT OF EMMA was last early, ranged up in the five path on
the far turn, improved position to take third but could not gain on the top two late. BOURBON BLUSH chased in the three path up the backstretch to the far
turn and dropped back. DESIREE showed early speed off the rail but lacked a rally down the lane. MUSHABOOM took the rail on the first turn, steadied
entering the backstretch, moved out wide and did not factor.

the lead from mid pack, went inside on the turn, moved out at the top of the turn for room, came into the stretch in the three path and evened out late while
holding the p[ace spot. CAZMAN was last, took the four path on the turn and rallied between horses down the lane to grind out the show. RAF pressed from
outside early, dropped back to a chasing position on the turn from the four path, and faltered at the eighth pole. MR ZYDECO , bumped at the start, chased
in the three path on the turn and had no rally. IRON MIKE bumped and swerved at the start, came widest on the turn and improved position late. AGAINST
THE LINE bumped at the start and was no factor. WILLIECATCHEM bumped at the start, was the inside speed early and stopped on the turn.

Footnotes
MAYBETHEDAY came from off the pace to rally four wide on the turn, ran on nicely in the the stretch and was best late. PSYCHOANALYST pressed inside
the leader, angled out entering the turn, ranged up to take over at the top of the turn, was overcome by the winner late but still second best. QUEEN CITY
KITTY chased from off the pace, got close but flattened out at the rail in the final furlong. IT WILL HAPPEN was the speed to the top of the stretch and
leveled out to be mid pack down the lane. GALLOPING HARMONY came under a ride nearing the turn and held position for the remainder.
LUVYASEEYABYE broke awkwardly, was away a step slow, but gained positon in the stretch. TREASURE WILBURNYA was well off the pace and gained
positon in the three path on the turn while not threatening. NUTNBUTAROXSTAR broke outward at the start, was mildly involved but posed no threat.
KAYLEE'S HOPE broke very awkward, lost ground, was widest in the stretch and did not factor.
