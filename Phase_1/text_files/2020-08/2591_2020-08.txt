SALUTE WITH HONOR led quickly, set a reserved pace, quickened upper stretch and widened under a brisk hand ride. REVVED UP settled off the pace,
chased angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn then finished with a determined drive. TIMESKIP raced from off the pace, chased along the rail and
two-wide through the far turn and was game to the end. LOOKINATAMIRACLE broke slowly, raced in mid pack, was hustled along the rail on the far turn
but failed to menace. EXPLODE stalked the pacesetter, chased hard on the far turn but tired in the final furlong. INCLUSIVE broke a bit outward and settled
at the rear of the pack, was hustled from the rail on the far turn but flattened out in the stretch.

DENMARK settled in mid pack, closed late backstretch, bid four-wide early on the far turn, drew clear under a ride, was hustled into the stretch then
widened under a drive and was taken in hand near the wire. I DANCE ALONE raced in mid pack, chased three and four-wide on the far turn then finished
gamely in vain. BREAD CRUMBS sett;ed off the pace, was hustled from the 1/2 mile pole then was steadied approaching traffic mid turn, chased three to
five-wide to the stretch and finished all out. KOMUNIST stalked the pace, lost his path entering the far turn, was hustled from the rail to three-wide and then
back to the fence upper stretch and finished gamely. GOLD VENTURE raced in mid pack, chased hard angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn but
never reached contention. TRINITY THUNDAH stalked the pace, bid early on the far turn but was no match for DENMARK, chased to the stretch and
evened out. JORDANS WAY settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide late turn then finished evenly. JUDICATOR, away slowly, was rated off
the pace, saved ground but lacked a rally. SECRET ROI led early, set a reserved pace along the rail, was engaged early on the far turn and retreated.
BIBLICALPROPORTION raced in mid pack, dropped back four-wide on the far turn and had no closing response.

GRETZKY THE GREAT pressed the pace, was hustled two-wide late turn, dug in through the stretch and was up late under a drive. INTO THE SUNRISE
led quickly, set a reserved pace, was hustled through the stretch but failed to to contain GRETZKY THE GREAT in the late stages. READY TO REPEAT
came out and bumped EXCEED just out of the gate, stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out at the top of the stretch, rallied, but didn't find his best stride
until the late stages. GOSPEL WAY was bumped by EXCEED at the outset and settled at the back of the pack, chased hard three-wide on the turn but
failed to menace. EXCEED was bumped by READY TO REPEAT and bumped GOSPEL WAY just out then was rated off the pace, rode the rail on the turn,
chased into the stretch but evened out in the final 16th.

turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and rallied gamely. FLEX stalked the pace, angled from two to four-wide late turn, bumped BODE'S TIPSY 3/16ths
out and finished with enthusiasm. AMERICAN GREAT, away slowly and off the pace, was taken back early turn then was hustled along the rail but failed to
menace. BODE'S TIPSY was pinched back early and settled in mid pack, came along the rail and two-wide through the turn, needed a path and split horses

Footnotes
VELOCE sat in mid pack three to two wide around the first turn, moved into contention with a three wide run on the far turn, loomed dangerously outside the
leader turning for home but stalled momentarily by the sixteenth pole, then kicked it in again late to get the nose in front on the wire in a blanket finish.
HUNGARY led quickly, his rider portioning out his energy as needed to keep them all at bay, had a clear lead in mid stretch but just failed to hold the winner
late in a four way photo. ARGENTIUM sat off the pace on the inside until shifting out from two to five wide on the far turn, was fanned into the seven path
turning for home and closed resolutely to just miss while still wide. GREEN FLEET was inside from off the pace, awaited room on the far turn and fell back
to trail, cut the corner turning for home, came out around a tiring foe, dipped back to the rail late and was coming best of all but ran out of real estate.
MAMBOINTHEFOREST sat in mid pack on the rail, moved up while on hold in behind the front runners into the stretch but levelled off in the final sixteenth.
GREEN GROWTH chased the leader along the inside, asked for best when the pace presser dropped off but could not sustain his bid and fell back down
the lane. LION'S GOLDENHEART had his head in the air at the start, off the pace and four to two wide on the first turn, moved up into range four wide on
the far turn but couldn't sustain his rally and dropped back mid stretch. COPINSAY ran in mid pack while four to two wide around the first turn, dropped back
to off the pace in late backstretch and did not make a run. SEGUIMI was up to stalk the leader into the first turn, stayed there until beginning to leak oil
midway on the far turn, backing through them from there. EXECUTIVE RETREAT was off the pace and three to two wide around the first turn, rallied nicely
three to four wide into range on the far turn but ran out of run as they turned for home.

Footnotes
ALDA was off slowly and settled at the back of the pack, chased along the rail through the turn, angled out with a furlong to run, rallied gamely and was up
just in time, driving. DREAMING OF DREW stalked the pace from the rail, moved off the fence upper stretch, closed gamely and led a 16th out, drove clear
but was caught on the wire. ILLEGAL SMILE (IRE) bumped with ALDA leaving the gate, showed speed, set a pressured pace, shook clear upper stretch,
was all out but failed to stave off DREAMING OF DREW with a 16th to run and gave way grudgingly. EMMELINE broke a step slowly, raced in striking
range, chased two to four-wide late turn then chased through the stretch but failed to menace. ROAD TO ROMANCE forced the pace two and three-wide,
was all out in the stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. PURRSUADE ME bumped with ILLEGAL SMILE at the outset, settled in mid pack, chased
three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
KING CAUSEWAY raced in mid pack, chased rail to three-wide late on the final turn, rallied, surged to the lead in the final 16th, driving. GIANT CRITIC
settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide through the far turn, launched a determined drive but was outkicked in the final stages. SECRET PATH
raced from off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn then rallied gamely between foes. DOOBIEDOOBIEDOOBIE broke outward, stalked the
pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn, bid at the 1/4 pole, shook clear upper stretch but failed to sustain the drive. SPANISH MAJOR broke
sharply then was taken in hand at the front, set the pace briefly, stalked the leader through the backstretch, bid late turn, could not match strides with
DOOBIEDOOBIEDOOBIE in the stretch and retreated. HARD N'SWEET was herded outward at the start, showed speed, took command leaving the
clubhouse turn, drew away, set a reserved pace, was engaged by two rivals at the 1/4 pole, yielded at the top of the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
MNEMBA ISLAND settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch, rallied outside and got up late under a hand ride.
MY SILENCER led quickly, set a reserved pace, was hustled into the stretch, shook clear but was caught late. CALL IT A WRAP raced from off the pace,
was hustled two-wide on the far turn then closed gamely along the rail. COMBATIVE stalked the pace, chased three-wide late turn then finished gamely.
TRICKY MAGICIAN stalked the pace, chased two-wide on the far turn, lost ground at the top of the stretch then finished evenly. SOCIETY'S TIGER drifted
out leaving the gate, settled off the pace, closed on the backstretch, chased three and four-wide on the far turn then evened out in the stretch.
AHEADBYACENTURY raced in mid pack, came four-wide through the far turn then lacked a closing response. LUCAS N' LORI, in range, chased hard
along the rail late turn but tired in the stretch. NATIVE PRINCE broke through the gate, trailed throughout and walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO
THE START CONCERNING NATIVE PRINCE DETERMINED THAT NATIVE PRINCE BROKE THROUGH THE GATE GIVING HIM AN UNFAIR START
AND DECLARED HIM A NONSTARTER.

Footnotes
VIEWFINDER settled in mid pack, raced four then three-wide on the clubhouse turn, closed five then four-wide on the far turn, then was game through the
stretch, drew even with the pacesetter in the late stages and drove clear. VEGAS KITTEN stalked the pace, raced three-wide on the first turn then closed
four-wide on the far turn, had command at the top of the stretch then was all out to hold but couldn't stave off the closer in the late stages. SOUPER SCAT
DADDY settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and rallied gamely. ROYAL LASER raced in mid pack,
chased four and five-wide on the far turn then closed gamely in the final furlong but lost the show position late. JUST LIKE LARRY saved ground while
stalked the pace, chased late turn but evened out in the final 16th. TOWN CRUISE got away slowly but sprinted up between foes to lead into the first turn,
set a pressured pace, was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. ALL GOOD in mid pack early, raced three wide into the first turn, chased
four-wide through the far turn but flattened out mid stretch. COLEYVILLE, pinched back at the outset, settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide
on the far turn but lacked a closing response. MOSCOW MINISTER broke slowly and trailed the field, was hustled from the rail on the far turn but was
eased in the stretch, crossed the wire and walked off. DESOLATOR pulled on the clubhouse turn and backstretch which resulted in him being lapped onto
the pacesetter but he dropped back late turn, was eased in the stretch, crossed the wire and walked off.
