Footnotes
SOUL PLANET was well placed, early, rallied four wide on the turn, prevailed by the narrowest of margins after a long drive. LE PETITE PAPILLON had
good position early, saved all the ground, opened up in the stretch and just missed. IVORY NOT WHITE was in hand early, had a mild bid, on the rail while
no threat. LUTOCOMO prompted the pace and weakened in mid stretch. THEDEVILMADEMEDOIT raced mid pack and was no threat. DAMISELA had
good early speed, then gave way in the stretch. FILLY RIDE was outrun.
