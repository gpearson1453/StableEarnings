APRILINTHEPINES broke with the leaders and raced along the inside when the frontrunner came off the rail on the turn came through along the inside and
pulled clear through the stretch for the victory. FABULOUS FORUM raced in the two path well off the pace early came wide through the lane and was
finishing with interest while not a threat to the winner. STORMY GALE showed the best early speed but raced off the rail allowing the eventual winner
through on the inside tired through the stretch and could not hold second. FLY DONNA FLY raced along the inside on the turn came out for the drive but
lacked a rally. OUR LADY BLING was away in good order but quickly fell well off the pace and never mounted a rally. PERFECT SPRING raced along the
inside and was never a serious factor while always well back.

task to the wire. GALLIFREY chased the eventual winner the entire race while two wide on the turn and had no rally through the stretch while easily holding

launch a rally. ANALYZE HER STYLE raced in the two path on the turn and never mounted a serious rally. TIENE TUMBAO showed some early speed for
the first quarter but then began a steady fade and was not a factor. TAYLOR GALS was reluctant to load into the starting gate raced mid pack for the first
quarter and then dropped back. MYSTIC WIND raced mid pack for the first half and then tired.
