Footnotes
PREMIER STAR was sent up between rivals soon after the break and took command, set the pace towards the inside while handling outside pressure,
moved away to a lengthy advantage while under some rating mid turn, responded when set down past the three sixteenths, wandered a bit but had plenty
left while steadily hand ridden the final fifty yards. FORTUNATE FRIENDS forced the pace between foes early on, dropped back some under coaxing
leaving the three eighths, regrouped heading towards the quarter pole and came back in game fashion through the final eighth. HALL PASS chased outside
a rival, angled further out mid turn, circled four wide into the stretch but could only muster up a slight response. SEANY P saved ground and raced in range
into the turn, failed to keep pace mid turn and came up empty in the drive. UPLIFTING forced the early pace three deep, was under pressure past the
quarter pole and gave way.

REIN SUPREME broke a step slow, was hustled up soon after and gained a stalking spot about three wide, moved out wider into the lane, bid four wide
outside runners, gained a slim lead inside the eighth pole, kept on with decent energy and got the place. GREASEDLIGHTNING saved ground off the pace,
advanced two wide into the lane, dropped back in and threatened past the furlong pole, vied but wasn't good enough. BARBSGRAY LION had speed
outside a rival then went clear after a furlong, met an outside bid from MARIE FROM PARIE leaving the three eighths, dueled with that one into the lane,
maintained a tenuous advantage to mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. MARIE FROM PARIE , a bit rank at the break, vied inside BARBSGRAY LION
early on, rated back off that one and angled out, rebid leaving the far turn, dueled from mid turn to mid stretch then faded. WILKO LOVESONG , three deep

PARADISE PRIDE , confidently handled disputing the early pace outside GINS AND TINS, gained a clear lead turning for home then steadily drew off while
kept to his business. GINS AND TINS disputed the pace inside the winner, began to weaken in upper stretch, angled out in mid stretch and continued to
regress. GREEK PRINCE trailed and steadily retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
WALK AWAY JOE settled well back, came under pressure past the three eighths, angle five wide into the lane, leveled off under left handed rousing near
mid stretch, sustained his surge to take command in deep stretch then went clear nearing the wire. ABUELO PAPS , ridden along three to four wide chasing
the pace, steadily progressed to take aim after a half mile, moved to command outside the dueling leaders entering the lane, drifted out under left handed
asking, was corrected when clear near mid stretch then failed to contain the winner while under some hand urging through the final sixteenth. MY FRIENDS
BEER popped open the gate when fractious, was backed out and examined, settled off the pace while saving some ground, angled three wide into the lane
and closed steadily through the last eighth. KARAN'S NOTION ducked in at the break, corrected and sprinted clear, set the pace towards the rail, met bids
nearing the quarter pole, stayed on past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly in the final yards. PRODIGIOUS BAY rated two wide off the leader, took
closer order leaving the far turn, bid under pressure mid stretch, fought on between runners into the lane, kept on with effort past the sixteenth marker then
faded late.

LIVE AID accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and was kept under urging in the drive. POUNDING MUSIC , two wide on the turn,
chased the winner in a willing effort. VILLAMOURA , fractious in the starting gate, bore out and was rank leaving the gate, saved ground on the turn, eased
out in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. PROMENADE PRINCESS , under urging soon after the break, was forwardly placed along the rail around the
turn and faltered in the stretch. POPEYE'S OYL , three deep on the turn, retreated through the stretch. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the break
but no action was taken.

ALWAYS FORGIVEN dwelt at the break spotting the field several lengths, rushed up outside rivals and reached a stalking spot after a quarter pole, bid to
clear into the lane, dug in when confronted heading to mid stretch, lost command near the sixteenth, pole, battled back under left handed encouragement ,
moved to command in deep stretch then prevailed. BOOBY TRAP broke a step slow, moved up near the six furlong marker then was taken to rate as the
winner rolled past to his outside, settled outside a rival mid turn, angled five wide into the lane, rallied under repeated right handed rousing to draw alongside
in mid stretch, moved to a short advantage with a sixteenth remaining, briefly lost momentum, dueled but wasn't quite good enough. INDIAN GHOST
checked along the rail leaving the three quarter pole, saved ground into the stretch and churned on to gain the show. AWESOME TRACKER cleared early
and dropped in set a soft pace, took some pressure leaving the far turn, could not resist the winner approaching the lane, stayed on willingly past the furlong
grounds then faded. MYSTERIO prompted the pace two wide, bid mid turn, forced the pace to the five sixteenths then faltered through the drive.
