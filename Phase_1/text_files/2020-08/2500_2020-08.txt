Footnotes
ABBY'S DESTINY stumbled badly with the rider losing the right rein at the start, dueled inside of a foe while in the three path, regained the rein at the
three-sixteenths pole, bid at the eighth pole and was clear with enough to hold off the closer. THIRST TRAP bore out at the start, stalked in the five path
outside of a rival, then closed with a belated rush. EVALUVNMACHINE dueled outside of the winner but was no match in the drive. PEPPER THEM GIRL
stalked the pace inside, but had no late bid.

Footnotes
JESSUP dueled outside of a foe, drew off at the eighth pole and won under a strong hand ride. ROB THE RICH dueled inside but couldn't match strides in
the stretch. LAVERY stalked in the three path, then faded. EEL POINT faded. BOLD ADVENTURE was not a factor. MACHO ALEGRE faded. VINUM threw
the rider warming up, then dwelt, was well back and galloped in. THERE WAS A BRIEF INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE. NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

Footnotes
LONTANI prompted the pace two wide while in the four to three path around the first turn, vied for the lead into and down the backstretch before assuming
command passing the five sixteenths pole, then drew off through the lane under driving pressure. TOSS OF FATE set the pace along the inside of
LONTANI while staying a path off of the inner rail, dueled for the lead down the backstretch after that foe made a bid, but proved no match for that rival at
the five sixteenths pole, and kept on to be second best. DAY TRIP had a slow start, stalked behind the leaders in the three path and between horses around
the first turn, chased the pace three wide around the far turn, but failed to produce a bid, weakened through the lane, but held show. BLESSED WITH LUCK
tracked the pace from the inside, but was no factor. STEWARDS RULES stalked in the five path around the first turn, then weakened into the far turn, was
done early, and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT MINKIE advanced from midpack in the five path and outside of horses around the turn to produce a bid for the lead turning for home, sustained
her grinding rally to surpass the leader passing the furlong marker, then drew off through the final sixteenth. REAL BELLA set a pressured pace between
horses early on, held an advantage in the two path around the turn before shifting to the three path turning for home, dug in in upper stretch inside of FLAT
OUT MINKLE, but relinquished the lead to that foe passing the furlong pole, and gave way. YESTERDAYS KISSES saved ground after being mildly shuffled
back to midpack into the turn, then passed a tiring foe two wide inside the final furlong to edge show. ONE SMART PRINCESS raced off of the pace in the
three path around the turn, shifted to the five path turning for home, and offered a mild rally for a minor reward. CRAFTY JUSTICE saved ground while far
off of the pace around the turn before shifting to the three path turning for home, but failed to menace while passing tired foes. LETSBEGREATAGAIN
pressed, then stalked, the pace setter along the inside into the turn, but proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, and further weakened at the sixteenth
pole. HELLO ADELE chased the pace setter from the four path, but was outmoved by the eventual winner turning for home, and weakened in upper stretch.
SNAPASELFIE trailed early on, and never got involved. DYNASTY OF GOODS raced far off of the pace two wide and never played a factor. PREMIUM
PASSION vied for the lead two wide and in the three path from between horses, but was outmoved by the eventual winner turning for home, then stopped
between horses at the furlong pole.

Footnotes
BREWSKY stalked the pace four wide around the first turn, vied outside of rivals down the backstretch, then outside of only NAUGHTY JUSTICE into the far
turn, was kept in the four path by her inner rival around that bend, but bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, then drew off through the final furlong.
NAUGHTY JUSTICE vied for the lead three wide and between horses early on, surpassed inner tiring foes into the far turn, held an advantage from
BREWSKY around that bend while staying in the three path, but was bested by that foe at the furlong marker. LITTLE MAEMI was off a step slow, settled off
of the pace two wide around the first turn, then advanced on her own power into the far turn to chase the leading duo from the five path, but proved no
match for those foes turning for home, then was well clear of fourth through the lane. DERBY PRINCESS trailed, improved into the far turn, took that bend in
the two path, then stayed on mildly through the lane along the inside without threatening the leaders. WHO WANTS WHAT was caught five wide around the
first turn, rallied in the four path around the far turn, but failed to threaten and flattened out in upper stretch. DOWNDELANE vied along the inside of rivals
down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with those foes into the far turn, then faded around that bend. QUEEN CHARMAINE raced close up behind
the pace setters in the three path around the first turn, got rank right behind traffic at the seven sixteenths pole, took up to take back in the early part of the
backstretch, but faded into and around the far turn. WINDY'S SPIRIT raced off of the pace along the inside, but was done early. GIRLYSGOTTHELOOKS
set the pace two wide and between horses around the first turn, vied between rivals in the early part of the backstretch, but weakened at the half mile pole,
steadily faded thereafter, and was eased through the lane. This race was hand timed.
