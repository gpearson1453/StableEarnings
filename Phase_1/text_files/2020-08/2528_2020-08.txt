Footnotes
NUCLEAR OPTION tracked the leading pair, gave chase patiently in the two path on the turn, was pushed along while taken three wide into upper stretch,
showed good kick when driven into the final furlong, and got up just in time. DUGOUT pulled to the lead, set a pressured pace inside while continuing to
race keenly through the turn, cleared when pushed along into the lane, went to a drive for the final furlong, came out under a left-handed crop, continued to
drift out slightly even under a right-handed crop late, and just failed to hold. TOHUI pressed the pace two wide, proved no match for the pacesetter into the
lane, was outpaced by the leading pair despite going to a drive midstretch, and was no longer asked in the final stages when the verdict was clear. DIRECT
DECEIT settled at the rear, was pushed along two wide into the turn, continued at the rear in the three path on the turn and was driven into the lane while
still in the three path, offered no bid and was not persevered with in the final sixteenth. DUE TO A TIMING MALFUNCTION ONLY THE WIN MARGIN WAS
PROVIDED BY THE OFFICIAL TRACK TIMER. OTHER FINAL MARGINS WERE DONE BY HAND.

Footnotes
SOUTHSIDER broke sharply and led the field up the backstretch, saved ground under pressure around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was
hand ridden to victory in the final sixteenth of a mile. HOMER brushed with the horse to his outside a few strides from the gate, raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, improved position on the rail in the stretch and proved to be the best of the rest.
HAUNTED MESA bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, brushed with the horse to his inside a few strides later, recovered to run in the
middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, raced wide around the turn, entered the stretch from the four path and made a mild gaining of ground
in the stretch. VALID STORM chased the leader through the early going, moved up to challenge passing the three eighths pole, raced in the two path
around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. CHARLIE IRISH was bumped by the horse to his inside and then pinched back leaving the gate, trailed
the field through the opening half mile, raced in the three path around the turn and made no bid. SPEARED raced inside at the back of the pack early, saved
ground around the turn and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
ALPHA BOY chased at the middle of a strung-out field inside of STANDFORTHEANTHEM, rallied in the five path on the far turn, circled three wide around
the tracking flight past the five sixteenths, sustained his rally into the lane, caught the pacesetter just past the furlong pole and drove clear. SLICK AS A PIN
was grazed by ROAD GAME in the opening strides, settled in second last, began to improve up the inside through the far turn, tipped three wide in upper
stretch, continued to rally, and gained on ALPHA BOY all the way to the wire. SERTOMAN chased well off the leading pair inside of HOUSE OF CORTEZ,
took closer order approaching the half mile, saved ground through the turn while still well off the leader, was driven inside foes in upper stretch, chased on
late outside of the fading pacesetter but proved no match for the top two. ROAD GAME grazed the gate and then SLICK AS A PIN after breaking outward,
led into the first turn, opened up through that bend, continued on a yawning lead down the backstretch and while saving ground through the far turn, was
driven into the stretch but nonetheless saw his lead evaporate, lost the lead just past the furlong mark and weakened inside. HIDE THE EVIDENCE soon
trailed, continued at the rear in the three path on the far turn, was driven approaching the turn for home, and passed inside of tired horses under continued
urging in the lane. STANDFORTHEANTHEM chased two wide in the middle of a well-strung field through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch,
continued in the five path toward the rear around the far turn, and lacked the needed rally in the lane. SYRUP tracked well behind the pacesetter, continued
to track in the three path on the far turn between SERTOMAN and HOUSE OF CORTEZ, could not gain on the leader in upper stretch, drifted out under a
drive and weakened in the final furlong. HOUSE OF CORTEZ chased the leading pair outside of SERTOMAN, took closer order in tandem with that foe
approaching the half mile pole, was driven three wide around that bend, and emptied out in the lane.

Footnotes
OVERPRAISE raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the frontrunners under a snug hold up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn,
snuck through on the rail passing the quarter pole, opened up entering the stretch and was kept to the task to the wire. TORNADO BOY raced in the two
path around the first turn, rated just off the leader up the backstretch, angled out to the three path around the far turn, moved up to challenge the leader
nearing the three eighths pole, and was no match for the winner in the stretch but did wear down the pace setter to get clear for second. BEST YOU EVER
SEEN hopped up leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field from the rail around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two
path, bore out mildly in mid stretch and gave way late. KALYDAR veered out and bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, was bumped and
forced out by GREENSPAN headed into the first turn, raced in the four path from there, continued up the backstretch on the outside, navigated the far turn
from the three path and managed to gain some ground late despite his previous trouble. LOVE THAT WARRIOR was bumped mildly by the horse to his
inside leaving the gate, settled towards the back of the pack while saving ground through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the far turn and
finished evenly. DARK WOOD (IRE) saved ground around the first turn, came up the backstretch on the inside towards the back of the pack, continued to
save ground around the far turn and was outkicked in the stretch. COUP DE VILLE was forced out to the six path and steadied heading into the first turn
when GREENSPAN came into his path, angled in slightly while trailing the field through the next half mile, moved up between horses headed into the far
turn, raced in the two path from there and mustered no bid. GREENSPAN hopped up leaving the gate, ran into traffic and was checked entering the turn,
veered out sharply bumping with KALYDAR and forcing that one and COUP DE VILLE out, settled to race on the outside towards the back of the pack,
navigated the far turn from the four path and was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
GET NONE was sent for pace, took constant pressure from HELEN MAE'S SONG inside of her, kept her head in front in upper stretch as that foe tried to
pass inside her, briefly opened up under a drive past the eighth pole, and held sway as that foe rerallied to her outside late. HELEN MAE'S SONG hounded
GET NONE from her inside, attempted to pass on the inside in upper stretch but could not get by, switched out behind GET NONE past the furlong pole,
rerallied outside of her but could not reel her in. SUPERSTAR DIVA tracked the leading pair inside of PROBABLY GRACE early, chased the leading trio
while racing in the two path on the turn, switched out midstretch, rallied outside the leading pair, gained with interest three wide but could not reel them in.
PROBABLY GRACE broke inward and soundly bumped DUSTY MILLER in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair outside of SUPERSTAR DIVA
early, continued to track them in the four path on the turn, proved no match for the leading pair into the lane, could not match SUPERSTAR DIVA's kick in
the lane, and kept on evenly. LION LOVE settled near the rear three wide early, dropped inside past the half mile mark, raced toward the rear in the two
path on the turn, came into the lane at the inside of the rear group, rallied under a drive, split horses in upper stretch, and kept on mildly inside foes late.
ADIOS HILLARY bumped THIRSTY COWGIRL in the opening strides, chased inside of DUSTY MILLER down the backstretch and between horses on the
turn, was urged between horses approaching the turn for home, chased on earnestly but was outfinished. DUSTY MILLER was bumped soundly in the
opening strides by HELEN MAE'S SONG, chased midpack outside of ADIOS HILLARY early, was pushed along three wide midfield on the turn, and
showed no kick in the lane. THIRSTY COWGIRL was bumped by ADIOS HILLARY in the opening strides, showed no early speed, raced at the rear in the
five path on the turn, came into the lane three wide under a drive and lacked the needed rally. NO TIME TO PLAY settled two wide near the rear early,
raced in the four path on the turn, was driven between horses into the lane but did not muster a bid. ANNIE TIME GIRL settled near the rear, saved ground
through the turn, and came up empty.

Footnotes
CONTRACTION chased the leader from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, took over the lead passing the half mile pole, dueled with
NO BOUNDARIES while saving ground around the turn, put away that rival entering the stretch and maintained his advantage to the wire. NO
BOUNDARIES raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside in the middle of the pack, began a bid entering the far
turn, dueled with the eventual winner from the two path into the stretch, and gave in to that one at the three sixteenths pole but was the best of the rest.
ROAR OF THE LION saved ground around the first turn, raced on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, began a bid nearing
the quarter pole and improved position in the stretch while never threatening the top two. AL TAWEEL trailed the field from the two path through the opening
three quarters of a mile and drifted out while passing tiring horses in the stretch. FORGOT TO FORGET saved ground around the first turn, staked the
frontrunners on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn and came up empty in the stretch. DANCIN NICKY broke quickly, led
the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back from the rail around the far turn and continued to tire in the
stretch. MIDNIGHT JOKER saved ground while racing off the pace around the first turn, moved up between horses up the backstretch, made a mild bid from
the three path around the far turn and flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
DOCS SEVEN was sent for speed, led into the turn, took pressure from BLONDE ON TAP to her outside from the three eighths, cleared into the lane before
being asked, went to a mild drive in the final furlong and held her advantage. FLASH TOWN broke slightly outward, was sent for early speed but outsprinted
into the turn by DOCS SEVEN, tracked the leading pair around the bend while racing behind and outside those foes, was urged in upper stretch to rally past
BLONDE ON TAP, chased DOCS SEVEN with interest down the lane but could not reel her in. SHE'S A BIG STAR chased inside of HIPPIE COWGIRL
while saving ground through the turn, was pushed along into the lane, went to a drive inside in upper stretch, kept on and held the show. HIPPIE COWGIRL
chased outside of SHE'S A BIG STAR, was pushed along in the three to four path near the three eighths, came into the lane between horses, was driven
approaching the furlong pole, kept on but narrowly missed the show. JOAN'S WAY was slow into stride, settled near the rear, veered out near the three
eighths, floated out into the lane in the six to seven path, and gained under a drive on the far outside. RUBY ROUND HERE settled toward the rear, raced in
the three path on the turn, was driven into the lane in the four path, and kept on mildly. YOUAWAKEMYSOUL settled at the rear, was pushed along in the
two to three path while racing a little greenly near the three eighths, saved ground into the lane, and made mild improvement inside of tired horses.
BLONDE ON TAP tracked DOCS SEVEN into the turn, pressed outside that foe from the three eighths, could not match her into the lane, and faded
between horses under a drive. SUNSHINE LINE tracked four wide between horses on the turn, was outpaced into the lane and not persevered with late.
QUICK KITTEN raced near the rear four wide on the turn, came into the lane in the five path, was urged through the final furlong but only passed a tiring
horse. ROYAL MISSION chased five wide on the turn, emptied out approaching the turn for home and was not persevered with late. LEONA VANDER (GB)
was pushed for speed in the opening strides but outsprinted to the top, suddenly began to tail off approaching the half mile mark, was eased up around the
turn, pulled up near the quarter pole, walked onto the horse ambulance, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
POSITIVE DANGER broke sharply and led the field from the rail around the first turn, maintained her advantage up the backstretch and around the far turn
and held off a late surging rival to save the win. PYTHONESS raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside at the
back of the pack, navigated the far turn from the three path and gained ground quickly on the outside in late stretch. LOVERS QUARREL was steadied
slightly leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, came up the backstretch on the outside in the middle of the pack, navigated the far turn
from the two path, raced in tight quarters in upper stretch, split horses near the eighth pole and improved position on the rail in the final furlong. LIGHT IN
THE DARK chased the leader from the rail around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and finished evenly up
the rail in the stretch. ENGLISH navigated the first turn from the two path, raced on the outside up the backstretch, angled out to the four path while running
around the far turn, began a wide bid near the quarter pole, went to a drive in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. SING ME HOME (GB)
saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn on the rail and made no
bid in the stretch. AIMARA saved ground around the first turn, raced on the inside at the back of the pack through the next half mile, navigated the far turn
from the two path and came up empty in the stretch. CAROLINE'S STORY chased the frontrunner from the two path around the first turn, continued to
pursue that rival on the outside up the backstretch, came around the second turn in the three path and tired badly in the final furlong. SLOANER saved
ground around the first turn, raced on the inside up the backstretch, dropped significantly behind the field after a half mile, continued to lose ground around
the far turn and was eased in the stretch.
