reserved pace, was hustled on the far turn, was engaged mid turn, dueled into the stretch, was headed a furlong out but finished under a full out drive.

PAPA'S PLACE had a rail trip fin mid pack, chased two-wide into the stretch, took command 3/16ths out and was kept to business to the end. SPANISH
MAJOR stalked the pace,was hustled hard from the rail to three-wide on the far turn then chased through the stretch. MAJESTIC MELODY broke outward
but edged to the early lead, drew away o the first turn, set a very restrained pace, came back to his rivals once he'd settled, was headed upper stretch and
chased to the wire. PATROL settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide under a ride on the far turn then launched a determined drive from the
outside. FRAC ATTACK broke outward and settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide through the far turn, was game in the stretch but failed to
menace. CAMP NARDO, off slowly, stalked the pace, backed away on the far turn and lacked a rally. MAYITO settled off the pace, trailed on the
backstretch and far turn, was eased in the stretch, crossed the wire and walked off.

FOUR KNIGHTS got away slowly, moved up quickly to force the pace into the clubhouse turn, bid into the far turn, dueled, led into the stretch and held
under a drive. WILLY'S CASTLE settled in mid pack, closed four-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch, lapped onto the leader, was determined, but
hung late. GREENFIELD raced in mid pack, chased two-wide into the stretch, moved to the rail and finished gamely. TISHINA settled in mid pack, was
hustled two and three-wide on the final turn, was blocked in the stretch, altered course to the outside and finished full out. HIT THE TICKET settled off the
pace, closed from the rail and two-wide on the far turn but was blocked approaching the stretch then finished evenly. WHO'S GOT IT raced in mid pack,
chased three-wide on the final turn and passed tiring foes in the stretch. NARROW ESCAPE set a pressured pace, moved clear briefly early on the
backstretch, dueled on the far turn, yielded approaching the stretch and retreated in the straight. DECISION DAY settled in mid pack, dropped back early on
the far turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GARTER stalked the pace in hand, was blocked along the rail at the 3/16th pole, had a patient rider and when a hole opened she surged to the
front. BOBBI'S LEGACY led quickly, set a pressured pace, dueled into the stretch, shook clear a furlong out but was caught in the late stages. PIQUET
pressed then forced the issue on the far turn, bid nearing the stretch, dueled, yielded in the final furlong and evened out late. MISS ARIEL, off slowly, settled
in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn then evened out in the final 16th. WHAT'S IN A KISS (IRE) broke slowly and settled off the
pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but failed to menace. TIZ MY RIGHT, rated in mid pack, rode the rail on both turns and was all out
through the stretch. LIGHT IT UP, in mid pack early, was hustled from the rear on the far turn but never reached contention.

Footnotes
OUR ZUMA got away alertly, dueled three-wide, had command mid turn, shook clear into the stretch and held PICCADILLY BEAU under a drive.
PICCADILLY BEAU raced in mid pack, closed three-wide late turn, chased into the stretch then gained steadily under a determined drive but just missed.
THANKS AGAIN was steadied just out and settled off the pace, came along the rail and two-wide through the turn, rallied gamely and was best of the rest.
SEIZE THE BAY stalked from the rail, was hustled on the turn, encountered traffic a furlong out, got clear but evened out late. HESATHRILLER raced in mid
pack, stalked angling from two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. STREET CAT SAM settled in mid pack, was hustled
three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a rally. SANDRETTI dueled two-wide, was headed mid turn, had no response in the stretch and
faded. ROYAL FUERST dueled from the rail, was headed mid turn then retreated through the stretch.
