Footnotes
SMOOTHING IRON broke outwardly bumping MICKEYS GOLD at the start, stalked the pacesetter in the clear, edged closer four wide and between rivals
midway on the turn with the aforementioned rival putting a head in front at the head of the lane, took charge at the furlong marker and edged away while
taken in hand late. MICKEYS GOLD was bumped at the break, stalked from outside, went five wide on the turn, bid and took a narrow and brief lead at the
very top of the stretch but was only second best. FARMER FRED R F settled last but one racing off the inside, went in the three path on the turn and was
encouraged late on that bend, swung five wide into upper stretch and got up for show honors. MR. SCRAPPY broke inwardly bothering a rival, was close up
two wide into the turn, began to drop back and failed to make a late bid. CLABBERS WIN broke awkwardly and was bumped then was immediately urged
forward, was in close along the rail into the turn then weakened. MOJAZZ set the pace from off the inside, went three wide on the turn and challenged by
outside rivals, came up empty. SKEETER COUNTY broke a step slowly, exchanged some bumps and steadied at the start, raced mostly in the four to five
path and was not a threat.

Footnotes
BUBBA NIGHTLINGER set a pressured pace racing off the rail, went in the three path on the turn and kicked clear turning into upper stretch then held off a
rallying rival. TREBULSKI settled early, switched out past the three-eighths pole going two to three wide on the turn, angled five wide coming out of that
bend and was gaining but too late. MARTHAS BOY shifted in heading up the backstretch, went further to the rail entering the turn, saved ground and
improved position. MUSCLE HEAD pressed outside the eventual winner, went four wide on the turn, weakened. PHOENIX FIRE clipped heels after the
start, raced wide going in the five to six path on the turn and improved. MR. FEARLESS chased briefly from outside a rival, dropped back four to five wide
on the turn and faded. SAMURAI JACK clipped heels in behind soon after the break, chased briefly up the backstretch in the three to four path, was eased
in the lane and walked off of his own accord. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

Footnotes
ACCLIMATED SONG dueled inside a rival but well off the fence, began to edge away in the three path on the turn, was clear into upper stretch and held
safe. RAMA WHO settled last but one, went in the four path on the turn still with much to do, gained between rivals in mid- to late-stretch. W F LA VENADA
switched outside rivals after clearing the gap at about the four and one half, went five wide on the turn, held show from EYEJUST TOOKCHARGE, who
trailed early and shifted in, went two deep on the turn, angled outside a tired rival in late stretch and just missed show honors. BOBBI BABY RUN broke
slowly spotting the field roughly five lengths, was encouraged forward and advanced inside rivals going in about the two path to nearly reach striking
distance by the head of the lane but could not sustain the effort and flattened out. SASSY KITTY dueled outside the winner going four wide into the turn,
gave way and faded. COASTIN N BLUE raced a bit erratic early, moved nearer the inside and saved ground along the rail through the turn while dropping
back, was eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
INFINITE OPTIMISM set the pace off the rail, entered the turn moving in just a bit to the two path and edged clear, was asked at the top of the stretch as a
rival came up alongside and headed at the furlong marker but responded and dug in to hold that rival and edge clear once again. DESERT REWARD
pressed from inside, switched out and found himself in a bit tight quarters about the seven-sixteenths, chased three wide on the turn, bid at the eight pole
briefly putting a short head in front but was held at bay thereafter. SACATONE broke a step slowly, was mildly coaxed forward to chase the top ones from
outside, dropped back off those two going four wide on the turn, proved no match but held show honors. MORO MAN was outpaced early, raced wide in the
five path on the turn, ran on mildly late. S S DIAMOND shifted in about the half-mile marker then found himself in a bit tight near the seven-sixteenths in
behind runners, continued to chase from on or just off the rail on the turn but dropped back and came up empty. HENNO MOMO saved ground on or just off
the rail on the turn, came out three wide into upper stretch but failed to rally. GOLDEN MERGER was ridden along but gave no real response while going
four to five wide on the turn and six deep into upper stretch.

COULD BE THE ONE shifted in heading up the backstretch, saved ground on or just off the rail on the turn, bid inside in mid-stretch taking the lead by the
sixteenth pole and edged away. MASTER RULER was just a bit fractious pre-race, set the pace facing outside pressure racing off the rail, edged clear in the
three path late on the turn, was overtaken in mid-stretch and outkicked while clear of the rest. EMBELLISHING BOB was in just a hair tight at the start,
settled toward the rear, raced just off the rail on the turn and got up for show honors gaining mildly late. E BAR GOLD pressed from outside, continued to
chase five wide on the turn, drifted out a path leaving that bend and lacked the needed late kick. YES ITSA STAR switched out about the half-mile marker
as a rival came in, went five to six wide on the turn floating out a further path into upper stretch and needed more. MR VIEW broke outwardly just a bit,
switched off the inside about the seven-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn, failed to rally. CRUMAN TAPOTE pressed from between runners, went four
wide on the turn, dropped back in the stretch and faded. DEVON'S IRON GIANT broke a step slowly, raced off the inside going in the five path on the turn
and was not a factor.
