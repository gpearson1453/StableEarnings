dug in gamely outside of that rival in a spirited stretch run and prevailed at the end. GOLDEN BROWN raced three wide early, then tracked close up inside,
made a rail bid entering the far turn, dueled with LOVE IS YOUR NAME, briefly took over, then dueled with PRENDIMI, dug in gamely inside through the
stretch drive and battled determinedly to the finish. LOVE IS YOUR NAME set the pace racing off the inside, dueled two wide on the far turn and weakened.
SO HOT stalked the leaders in the early stages, then chased and gave way. ASHLEY'S HOPE was outrun. CHEDDAR CHUB was outrun.
