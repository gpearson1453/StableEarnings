PNEUMATIC raced three wide early, settled nicely into a good stalking position outside, commenced his bid entering the far turn, took charge passing the
quarter pole, pulled away under right handed encouragement and was kept to the task through the final sixteenth. JESUS' TEAM raced three wide early,
stalked between rivals, was asked to pick it up on the far turn, came wide into the lane, finished well outside in the final furlong and earned the place spot.
ARKAAN set the pace racing in the two path, showed the way into the far turn, dueled inside of the winner on the turn, could not stay with that rival, then
dug in gamely through the lane and stayed on well for a share. SUPER JOHN was off just a step slow, pulled between rivals on the clubhouse turn, settled
off the pace between horses, chased inside on the far turn and weakened. WARTIME HERO raced close up on the rail, chased inside on the far turn and
tired. BIG CITY BOB steadied slightly on the rail on the first turn, tracked inside, failed to respond and gave way. SKYSCANNER did not factor. AS SEEN
ON TV raced four wide early, settled three wide off the pace, two wide on the far turn and gave way.
